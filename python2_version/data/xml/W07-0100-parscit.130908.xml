Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99698780952381">
Figurative language, such as metaphor, metonymy, idioms, personification, simile, among others, is
in abundance in natural discourse. It is an effective apparatus to heighten effect and convey various
meanings, such as humor, irony, sarcasm, affection, etc. Figurative language can be found not only in
fiction, but also in everyday speech, newspaper articles, research papers, and even technical reports. The
recognition of figurative language use and the computation of figurative language meaning constitute
one of the hardest problems for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. Resolution of this
problem involves both a solid understanding of the distinction between literal and non-literal language
and the development of effective computational models that can make the appropriate semantic
interpretation automatically.
The emphasis of this workshop is on computational approaches to figurative language, be it modeling or
natural language processing. The goal of the workshop is to provide a venue for researchers to reach a
better understanding of the new issues and challenges that need to be tackled in dealing with non-literal
phenomena. We are very happy that the workshop has attracted people from different disciplines and
hope that the workshop will continue to live in the future.
It is our pleasure to thank our invited speaker, Rada Mihalcea (of University of North Texas), for
her presentation ”The Language of Humor”. We would also like to thank all the members of the
program committee for their advice and for reviewing the papers carefully on a tight schedule. Enjoy
the workshop!
