Complex predicate is a noun, a verb, an ad-
jective or an adverb followed by a light verb
that behaves as a single unit of verb. Com-
plex predicates (CPs) are abundantly used in
Hindi and other languages of Indo Aryan
family. Detecting and interpreting CPs con-
stitute an important and somewhat a diffi-
cult task. The linguistic and statistical
methods have yielded limited success in
mining this data. In this paper, we present a
simple method for detecting CPs of all kinds
using a Hindi-English parallel corpus. A CP
is hypothesized by detecting absence of the
conventional meaning of the light verb in
the aligned English sentence. This simple
strategy exploits the fact that CP is a multi-
word expression with a meaning that is dis-
tinct from the meaning of the light verb. Al-
though there are several shortcomings in the
methodology, this empirical method surpri-
singly yields mining of CPs with an average
precision of 89% and a recall of 90%.

<bodyText confidence="0.999940809523809">
Complex predicates (CPs) are abundantly used in
Hindi and other languages of Indo-Aryan family
and have been widely studied (Hook, 1974; Ab-
bi, 1992; Verma, 1993; Mohanan, 1994; Singh,
1994; Butt, 1995; Butt and Geuder, 2001; Butt
and Ramchand, 2001; Butt et al., 2003). A com-
plex predicate is a multi-word expression
(MWE) where a noun, a verb or an adjective is
followed by a light verb (LV) and the MWE be-
haves as a single unit of verb. The general theory
of complex predicate is discussed in Alsina
(1996). These studies attempt to model the lin-
guistic facts of complex predicate formation and
the associated semantic roles.
CPs empower the language in its expressive-
ness but are hard to detect. Detection and inter-
pretation of CPs are important for several tasks
of natural language processing tasks such as ma-
chine translation, information retrieval, summa-
rization etc. A mere listing of the CPs constitutes
a valuable linguistic resource for lexicographers,
wordnet designers (Chakrabarti et al., 2007) and
other NLP system designers. Computational me-
thod using Hindi corpus has been used to mine
CPs and categorize them based on statistical
analysis (Sriram and Joshi, 2005) with limited
success. Chakrabarti et al. (2008) present a me-
thod for automatic extraction of V+V CPs only
from a corpus based on linguistic features. They
report an accuracy of about 98%. An attempt has
also been made to use a parallel corpus for de-
tecting CPs using projection POS tags from Eng-
lish to Hindi (Soni, Mukerjee and Raina, 2006).
It uses Giza++ word alignment tool to align the
projected POS information. A success of 83%
precision and 46% recall has been reported.
In this paper, we present a simple strategy for
mining of CPs in Hindi using projection of
meaning of light verb in a parallel corpus. In the
following section the nature of CP in Hindi is
outlined and this is followed by system design,
experimentation and results.

2 Complex Predicates in Hindi

A CP in Hindi is a syntactic construction consist-
ing of either a verb, a noun, an adjective or an
adverb as main predicator followed by a light
verb (LV). Thus, a CP can be a noun+LV, an
adjective+LV, a verb+LV or an adverb+LV. Fur-
ther, it is also possible that a CP is followed by a
LV (CP+LV). The light verb carries the tense
and agreement morphology. In V+V CPs, the
contribution of the light verb denotes aspectual
terms such as continuity, perfectivity, inception,
completion, or denotes an expression of forceful-
ness, suddenness, etc. (Singh, 1994; Butt, 1995).
The CP in a sentence syntactically acts as a sin-
gle lexical unit of verb that has a meaning dis-

tinct from that of the LV. CPs are also referred as
the complex or compound verbs.
Given below are some examples:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.937148">
(1): CP=noun+LV
noun = ashirwad {blessings}
LV = denaa {to give}
usane mujhe ashirwad diyaa.
उसने मुझे आशȸवाद Ǒदया
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.803362">
{he me blessings gave}
he blessed me.

<listItem confidence="0.85528">
(2) No CP

<equation confidence="0.5956885">

उसने मुझे एक पुèतक दȣ
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999861947368421">
{he me one book gave}
he gave me a book.
In (1), the light verb diyaa (gave) in its past tense
form with the noun ashirwad (blessings) makes a
complex predicate verb form ashirwad diyaa
(blessed) in the past tense form. The CP here is
ashirwad denaa and its corresponding English
translation is ‘to bless’. On the other hand in ex-
ample (2), the verb dii (gave) is a simple verb in
past tense form and is not a light verb. Although,
same Hindi verb denaa (to give) is used in both
the examples, it is a light verb in (1) and a main
verb in (2). Whether it acts as a light verb or not,
depends upon the semantics of the preceding
noun. However, it is observed that the English
meaning in case of the complex predicate is not
derived from the individual meanings of the con-
stituent words. It is this observation that forms
basis of our approach for mining of CPs.

<equation confidence="0.6368992">
(3) CP=adjective+LV
adjective=khush {happy}
LV=karanaa {to do}
usane mujhe khush kiyaa.
उसने मुझे खुश ͩकया
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994775333333333">
{he me happy did}
he pleased me.
Here the Hindi verb kiyaa (did) is the past tense
form of a light verb karanaa (to do) and the pre-
ceding word khush (happy) is an adjective. The
CP here is khush karanaa (to please).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6432435">
(4) CP=verb+LV
verb = paRhnaa {to read}
LV = lenaa {to take}

<equation confidence="0.58921">
उसने पुèतक पढ़ ͧलया
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997996125">
{he book read took}
he has read the book.
Here the Hindi verb liyaa (took) is the past tense
form of the light verb lenaa (to take) and the pre-
ceding word paRh (read) is the verb paRhnaa (to
read) in its stem form. The CP is paRh lenaa (to
finish reading). In such cases the light verb acts
as an aspectual /modal or as an intensifier.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6923496">
(5) CP=verb+LV
verb = phaadanaa {to tear}
LV = denaa {to give}
usane pustak phaad diyaa.
उसने पुèतक फाड़ Ǒदया
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999163285714286">
{he book tear gave}
he has torn the book.
Here the Hindi verb diyaa (gave) is the past tense
form of the light verb denaa (to give) and the
preceding word phaad (tear) is the stem form of
the verb phaadanaa (to tear) . The CP is phaad
denaa (to cause and complete act of tearing).

<listItem confidence="0.962917">
(6) CP=verb+LV
verb = denaa {to give}
LV = maaranaa{to hit/ to kill}
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9382715">
usane pustak de maaraa.
उसने पुèतक दे मारा
{he book give hit}
he threw the book.
Here the Hindi verb maaraa (hit/killed) is the
past tense form of the light verb maaranaa (to
hit/ to kill) and the preceding word de (give) is a
verb denaa (to give) in its stem form. The CP is
de maranaa (to throw). The verb combination
yields a new meaning. This may also be consi-
dered as a semi-idiomatic construct by some
people.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993382875">
(7) CP=adverb+LV1+LV2
adverb = vaapas{back}

<bodyText confidence="0.999830913043478">
he returned the book.
Here there are two Hindi light verbs used. The
verb kar (do) is the stem form of the light verb
karanaa (to do) and the verb diyaa (gave) is the
past tense form of the light verb denaa (to give).
The preceding word vaapas (back) is an adverb.
One way of interpretation is that the CP (a con-
junct verb) vaapas karanaa (to return) is fol-
lowed by another LV denaa (to give) signifying
completion of the task. Another way of looking
at it is to consider these as a combination of two
CPs, vaapas karanaa (to return) and kar denaa
(to complete the act). The semantic interpreta-
tions in the two cases remain the same. It may be
noted that the word vaapas (return) is also a noun
and in such a case the CP is a noun+LV.
From all the above examples, the complexity
of the task of mining the CPs is evident. Howev-
er, it is also observed that in the translated text,
the meaning of the light verb does not appear in
case of CPs. Our methodology for mining CPs is
based on this observation and is outlined in the
following section.

As outlined earlier, our method for detecting a
CP is based on detecting a mismatch of the Hindi
light verb meaning in the aligned English sen-
tence. The steps involved are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989575351351352">
1) Align the sentences of Hindi-English corpus;
2) Create a list of Hindi light verbs and their
common English meanings as a simple verb;
(Table 1)
3) For each Hindi light verb, generate all the
morphological forms (Figure 1);
4) For each English meaning of the light verb as
given in table 1, generate all the morphologi-
cal forms (Figure 2);
5) For each Hindi-English aligned sentence,
execute the following steps:
a) For each light verb of Hindi (table 1),
execute the following steps:
i) Search for a Hindi light verb (LV)
and its morphological derivatives
(figure 1) in the Hindi sentence and
mark its position in the sentence (K);
ii) If the LV or its morphological deriv-
ative is found, then search for the
equivalent English meanings for any
of the morphological forms (figure
2) in the corresponding aligned Eng-
lish sentence;
iii) If no match is found, then scan the
words in the Hindi sentence to the
left of the Kth position (as identified
in step (i)); else if a match is found,
then exit {i.e. go to step (a)}.
iv) If the scanned word is a ‘stop word’
(figure 3), then ignore it and contin-
ue scanning;
v) Stop the scan when it is not a ‘stop
word’ and collect the Hindi word
(W);
vi) If W is an ‘exit word’ then exit {i.e.
go to step (a)}, else the identified CP
is W+LV.

Hindi has a large number of light verbs. A list
of some of the commonly used light verbs along
with their common English meanings as a simple
verb is given in table 1. The light verb kar (do) is
the most frequently used light verb. Using its
literal meaning as ‘do’, as a criterion for testing
CP is quite misleading since ‘do’ in English is
used in several other contexts. Such meanings
have been shown within parentheses and are not
used for matching.

For each of the Hindi light verb, all morpho-

are given in figures 1(a) and 1(b). Similarly, for
each of the English meaning of the light verb, all

Figure 2 shows a few illustrations of the same.
There are a number of words that can appear
in between the nominal and the light verb in a
CP. These words are ignored in search for a CP
and are treated as stop words. These are words
that denote negation or are emphasizers, inten-
sifiers, interrogative pronoun or a particle. A list

We use a list of words of words that we have

a CP in Hindi. We have used Hindi case (vibhak-

However, this list can be augmented based on

be noted that we do not perform parts of speech

The CP mining methodology outlined earlier has
been implemented and tested over multiple files
of EMILLE (McEnery, Baker, Gaizauskas and
Cunningham, 2000) English-Hindi parallel cor-
pus. A summary of the results obtained are given
in table 2. As can be seen from this table, the
precision obtained is 80% to 92% and the recall
is between 89% to 100%. The F-measure is 88%
to 97%. This is a remarkable and somewhat sur-
prising result from the simple methodology
without much of linguistic or statistical analysis.
This is much higher than what has been reported
on the same corpus by Mukerjee et al, 2006
(83% precision and 46% recall) who use projec-
tion of POS and word alignment for CP identifi-
cation. This is the only other work that uses a
parallel corpus and covers all kinds of CPs. The
results as reported by Chakrabarti et al. (2008)
are only for V-V CPs. Moreover they do not re-
port the recall value.

It is obvious that this empirical method of
mining CPs will fail whenever the Hindi light
verb maps on to its core meaning in English. It
may also produce garbage as POS of the preced-
ing word is not being checked. However, the
mining success rate obtained speaks of these be-
ing in small numbers in practice. Use of the
‘stop words’ in allowing the intervening words
within the CPs helps a lot in improving the per-
formance. Similarly, use of the ‘exit words’
avoid a lot of incorrect identification.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999844">
The simple empirical method for mining CPs
outlined in this work, yields an average 89% of
precision and 90% recall which is better than the
results reported so far in the literature. The major
drawback is that we have to generate a list of all
possible light verbs. This list appears to be very
large for Hindi. Since no POS tagging or statis-
tical analysis is performed, the identified CPs are
merely a list of mined CPs in Hindi with no lin-
guistic categorization or analysis. However, this
list of mined CPs is valuable to the lexicograph-
ers and other language technology developers.
This list can also be used for word alignment
tools where the identified components of CPs are
grouped together before the word alignment
process. This will increase both the alignment
accuracy and the speed.
The methodology presented in this work is
equally applicable to all other languages within
the Indo-Aryan family.

<abstract confidence="0.998570434782609">Complex predicate is a noun, a verb, an adjective or an adverb followed by a light verb that behaves as a single unit of verb. Complex predicates (CPs) are abundantly used in Hindi and other languages of Indo Aryan family. Detecting and interpreting CPs constitute an important and somewhat a difficult task. The linguistic and statistical methods have yielded limited success in mining this data. In this paper, we present a simple method for detecting CPs of all kinds using a Hindi-English parallel corpus. A CP is hypothesized by detecting absence of the conventional meaning of the light verb in the aligned English sentence. This simple strategy exploits the fact that CP is a multiword expression with a meaning that is distinct from the meaning of the light verb. Although there are several shortcomings in the methodology, this empirical method surprisingly yields mining of CPs with an average precision of 89% and a recall of 90%.</abstract>

A summary of the results obtained are given in table 2. As can be seen from this table, the precision obtained is 80% to 92% and the recall is between 89% to 100%. The F-measure is 88% to 97%. This is a remarkable and somewhat surprising result from the simple methodology without much of linguistic or statistical analysis. This is much higher than what has been reported on the same corpus by Mukerjee et al, 2006 (83% precision and 46% recall) who use projection of POS and word alignment for CP identification. This is the only other work that uses a parallel corpus and covers all kinds of CPs. The results as reported by Chakrabarti et al. (2008) are only for V-V CPs. Moreover they do not report the recall value.

Thus, a CP can be a noun+LV, an adjective+LV, a verb+LV or an adverb+LV. Further, it is also possible that a CP is followed by a LV (CP+LV). The light verb carries the tense and agreement morphology. In V+V CPs, the contribution of the light verb denotes aspectual terms such as continuity, perfectivity, inception, completion, or denotes an expression of forcefulness, suddenness, etc. (Singh, 1994; Butt, 1995).

A CP is hypothesized by detecting absence of the conventional meaning of the light verb in the aligned English sentence. This simple strategy exploits the fact that CP is a multiword expression with a meaning that is distinct from the meaning of the light verb. Although there are several shortcomings in the methodology, this empirical method surprisingly yields mining of CPs with an average precision of 89% and a recall of 90%. 1 Introduction Complex predicates (CPs) are abundantly used in Hindi and other languages of Indo-Aryan family and have been widely studied (Hook, 1974; Abbi, 1992; Verma, 1993; Mohanan, 1994; Singh, 1994; Butt, 1995; Butt and Geuder, 2001; Butt and Ramchand, 2001; Butt et al., 2003). A complex predicate is a multi-word expression (MWE) where a noun, a verb or an adjective is followed by a light verb (LV) and the MWE behaves as a single unit of verb. The general theory of complex predicate is discussed in Alsina (1996). These studies attempt to model the linguistic facts of complex predicate formation and the associated semantic roles.

CPs empower the language in its expressiveness but are hard to detect. Detection and interpretation of CPs are important for several tasks of natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, information retrieval, summarization etc. A mere listing of the CPs constitutes a valuable linguistic resource for lexicographers, wordnet designers (Chakrabarti et al., 2007) and other NLP system designers. Computational method using Hindi corpus has been used to mine CPs and categorize them based on statistical analysis (Sriram and Joshi, 2005) with limited success. Chakrabarti et al. (2008) present a method for automatic extraction of V+V CPs only from a corpus based on linguistic features. They report an accuracy of about 98%. An attempt has also been made to use a parallel corpus for detecting CPs using projection POS tags from English to Hindi (Soni, Mukerjee and Raina, 2006). It uses Giza++ word alignment tool to align the projected POS information. A success of 83% precision and 46% recall has been reported. In this paper, we present a simple strategy for mining of CPs in Hindi using projection of meaning of light verb in a pa</context>
