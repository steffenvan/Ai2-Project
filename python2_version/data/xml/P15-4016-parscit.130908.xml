Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908409090909">
Annotations are increasingly created and
shared online and connected with web re-
sources such as databases of real-world
entities. Recent collaborative efforts to
provide interoperability between online
annotation tools and resources have intro-
duced the Open Annotation (OA) model,
a general framework for representing an-
notations based on web standards. Build-
ing on the OA model, we propose to share
annotations over a minimal web inter-
face that conforms to the Representational
State Transfer architectural style and uses
the JSON for Linking Data representation
(JSON-LD). We introduce tools support-
ing this approach and apply it to several
existing annotation clients and servers,
demonstrating direct interoperability be-
tween tools and resources that were pre-
viously unable to exchange information.
The specification and tools are available
from http://restoa.github.io/.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995265625">
Annotation is an important task in many fields
ranging from historical and literary study to exper-
imental sciences including biology. The value of
annotations is closely associated with the ability to
share them. The web has become instrumental to
information sharing, and there has thus been much
interest in web-based tools and repositories for the
creation, collaborative editing and sharing of an-
notations. Unfortunately, design and implemen-
tation differences have resulted in poor interoper-
ability, raising barriers to communication and in-
troducing costs from the need to convert between
data models, formats, and protocols to bridge dif-
ferent systems.
To fully interoperate, annotation tools and re-
sources must agree at least on a way to name and
refer to things, an abstract data model, a format
capturing that model, and a communication proto-
col. Here, we suggest a web application program-
ming interface (API) that resolves these questions
by building upon web standards and best practices,
namely Linked Data principles (Bizer et al., 2009),
the Open Annotation data model (Bradshaw et al.,
2013) and its serialization as JSON-LD (Sporny
et al., 2014), and a minimal HTTP-based proto-
col adhering to the Representational State Trans-
fer (REST) architectural style (Fielding and Tay-
lor, 2002). By implementing support for the API
in a variety of independently developed annotation
tools and resources, we demonstrate that this ap-
proach enables interoperability and novel ways of
combining previously isolated methods.

2 Design
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993029571428571">
We aim to define a minimal web API for shar-
ing annotations that conforms closely to relevant
standards and best practices. This should reduce
implementation effort and ensure generality and
compatibility with related efforts (Section 5). We
next briefly discuss the components of our design.
Linked Data. We use representations based on
the Resource Description Framework (RDF) stan-
dards for modeling data on the web, following
the best practice of using HTTP uniform resource
identifiers (URIs), which provide useful informa-
tion when dereferenced (Bizer et al., 2009).
Open Annotation. We describe text annotations
according to the OA draft W3C standard1, which

is an RDF-based graph representation compati-
ble with linguistic annotation formalisms such as
LAF/CrrAF (Ide and Suderman, 2007; Verspoor
and Livingston, 2012). At its most basic level, the
OA model differentiates between three key com-
ponents: annotation, body, and target, where the
annotation expresses that the body is related to the
target of the annotation (Figure 1). The body can
carry arbitrarily complex embedded data.
JSON-LD was recently accepted as a standard
RDF serialization format (Sporny et al., 2014) and
is the recommended serialization of OA. Every
JSON-LD document is both a JSON document and
a representation of RDF data. Figure 2 shows
an example of a simple annotation using the OA
JSON-LD representation.2

RESTful architecture We define a resource-
oriented API that uses HTTP verbs to manipulate
resources (Table 1). The API provides hypermedia
controls in data using JSON-LD and established
link relations, in conformance with best practices
for RESTful APIs (Fielding and Taylor, 2002).
The API defines just two types of resources: an
annotation and a collection of annotations. The
former is defined according to the core OA spec-
ification. While there are no formal standards for
the representation of collections in RESTful APIs,

3 Reference Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998175">
To support the development, testing and integra-
tion of RESTful OA API implementations, we
have created a reference server and client as well
as tools for format conversion and validation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997849">
3.1 OA Store
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997383363636364">
The OA Store is a reference implementation of
persistent, server-side annotation storage that al-
lows clients to create, read, update and delete an-
notations using the API. The store uses MongoDB,
which is well suited to the task as it is a document-
oriented, schema-free database that natively sup-
ports JSON for communication. The API is imple-
mented using the Python Eve framework, which is
specifically oriented towards RESTful web APIs
using JSON and is thus easily adapted to support
OA JSON-LD.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999551">
3.2 OA Explorer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989222222222">
The OA Explorer is a reference client that provides
an HTML interface for navigating and visualizing
the contents of any compatible store (Figure 3).
The service first prompts the user for a store URL
and then provides the user with a dynamically gen-
erated view of the contents of the store, which it
discovers using the API. OA Explorer is imple-
mented in Python using the Flask microframework
for web development.

3.3 Format conversion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964088235294">
The OA Adapter is middleware that we created
for sharing Open Annotation data. The software
implements both the client and server sides of the
API and a variety of conversions to and from dif-
ferent serializations of the OA model and related
formats using the OA JSON-LD serialization as
the pivot format. This allows the OA Adapter
to operate transparently between a client and a
server, providing on-the-fly conversions of client
requests from representations favored by the client
into ones favored by the server, and vice versa for
server responses. Standard HTTP content negotia-
tion is used to select the best supported representa-
tions. The adapter implements full support for all
standard RDF serializations: JSON-LD, N-Triples
and N-Quads, Notation3, RDF/XML, TriG, TriX,
and Turtle. With the exception of named graphs
for serializations that do not support them, conver-
sion between these representations is guaranteed
to preserve all information.
In addition to the general, reversible format
translation services provided by the OA Adapter,
we provide scripts for offline conversion of vari-
ous annotation file formats into the OA JSON-LD
format to allow existing datasets to be imported
into OA stores. The following are currently sup-
ported: Penn Treebank format (including PTB II
PAS) (Marcus et al., 1994), a number of variants
of CoNLL formats, including CoNLL-U,5 Know-
tator XML (Ogren, 2006), and the standoff format
used by the BRAT annotation tool (Stenetorp et al.,
2012). We also provide supporting tools for im-
porting files with OA JSON-LD data to a store and
exporting to files over the RESTful OA API.

3.4 Validation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998579">
OA JSON-LD data can be validated on three lev-
els: 1) whether the data is syntactically well-
formed JSON, 2) whether it conforms to the
JSON-LD specification, and 3) whether the ab-
stract information content fulfills the OA data
model. The first two can be accomplished using
any one of the available libraries that implement
the full JSON-LD syntax and API specifications.6
To facilitate also validation of conformity to the
OA data model, we define the core model of the
OA standard using JSON Schema (Galiegue and
Zyp, 2013). The JSON Schema community has
provided tools in various programming languages
for validating JSON against a JSON Schema. The
schema we defined is capable of validating data for
compliance against JSON-LD and OA Core at the
same time. Complementing this support for data
validation, we are also developing a standalone
tool for testing web services for conformance to
the RESTful OA API specification.

In addition to creating reference implementations,
we have adapted two previously introduced web-
based annotation tools to support the API. We
further demonstrate the scope and scalability of
the framework on several publicly available mass-
scale datasets from the biomedical domain, show-
ing how annotations on millions of documents
can be transparently linked across well-established
database services and to non-textual resources
such as gene and protein databases.

<bodyText confidence="0.999966947368421">
The brat rapid annotation tool (BRAT) is an open-
source web-based annotation tool that supports a
wide range of text annotation tasks (Stenetorp et
al., 2012). It provides intuitive visualization of
text-bound and relational annotations and allows
for annotations to be created and edited using a
drag-and-drop interface (Figure 4). The server is
a web service implemented in Python, whereas
the client is a browser-based application written in
JavaScript. For annotation storage, the server uses
a file-based back-end with a stand-off file format7.
The original client and server implement a cus-
tom communication protocol, leading to tight cou-
pling between the two. We rewrote the client
and server communication components to use OA
JSON-LD and the RESTful API as an alternative
to the native format and protocol, thus enabling
both components to communicate also with other
clients and servers.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997446">
The tagtog web-based annotation system is de-
signed to combine manual and automatic annota-
tions to accurately and efficiently mark up full-text
articles (Cejuela et al., 2014). The system was
originally developed with a focus on annotating
biological entities and concepts such as genes and
Gene Ontology terms. The web interface is im-
plemented in JavaScript using the Play framework
with Scala. The system is centered on the concept
of user projects, each of which holds a corpus of
annotated documents.
To make tagtog interoperable with other REST-
ful OA clients and servers, we made two major
implementation changes. First, the server can now
serve annotations in OA JSON-LD format, thus
allowing them to be viewed by other clients. Sec-
ond, the tagtog interface can visualize and edit OA
JSON annotations from other OA stores, without
a backing tagtog project. Figure 5 shows a sample
document annotated in tagtog.

4.3 Biomedical entity recognition resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999687633333333">
We implemented the API for four large-scale
databases of biomedical entity mentions. The
COMPARTMENTS database integrates evidence
on protein subcellular localization (Binder et al.,
2014), and TISSUES and DISEASES similarly in-
tegrate evidence on tissue expression and disease-
associations of human genes, respectively (Santos
et al., 2015; Pletscher-Frankild et al., 2015). All
three resources include a text mining component
based on the highly efficient NER engine used
also for detection of species names and names of
other taxa in the ORGANISMS database (Pafilis et
al., 2014). Together, these databases contain over
123M mentions of genes/proteins, cellular compo-
nents, tissues and cell lines, disease terms and tax-
onomic identifiers. This dataset is regularly pre-
computed for the entire Medline corpus, which
currently consists of more than 24M abstracts and
3B tokens.
To make this large collection of automatic an-
notations available as OA JSON-LD, we defined
the annotations of each abstract to be a separate
(sub)collection of a document resource, accessible
using URL patterns of the form http://.../
document/{docid}/annotations/. The
web services were implemented as part of the
Python framework common to all four databases.
They query a PostgreSQL back-end for text and
annotations, which are formatted as OA JSON-LD
using the standard Python json module.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.950707">
4.4 EVEX
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997936">
The EVEX database is a collection of events from
the molecular biology domain obtained by pro-
cessing the entire collection of PubMed articles
and PubMed Central Open Access full-text arti-
cles (Van Landeghem et al., 2013), together con-
stituting a corpus of nearly 6B tokens. In to-
tal, EVEX contains 40M individual events among
77M entity mentions. The events are of 24 dif-
ferent types (e.g. POSITIVE REGULATION, PHOS-
PHORYLATION) and the participants are primar-
ily genes and proteins. Where possible, the entity
mentions are grounded to their corresponding En-
trez Gene database identifiers.
The event structures consist of entity mentions,
trigger phrases expressing events, and typed
relations identifying the roles that the entities play
in the events. All of this data is accessible through
a newly implemented EVEX API compliant with
the OA JSON-LD format. Every document is de-
fined as a separate annotation collection following
the approach described in Section 4.3. The EVEX
web service is written in Python using the Django
web framework. Data are stored in a MySQL
database and the OA JSON-LD interface uses the
standard Python json module for formatting.

We have proposed to share annotations using a
minimal RESTful interface for Open Annotation
data in JSON-LD. We introduced reference im-
plementations of a server, client, validation and
conversion tools, and demonstrated the integra-

work, we will continue to develop the API speci-

standardization efforts and interested parties us-

ticular on modular extensions to the specification
for supporting search, tagging, and bulk modifica-

Recent collaborative efforts to provide interoperability between online annotation tools and resources have introduced the Open Annotation (OA) model, a general framework for representing annotations based on web standards. Building on the OA model, we propose to share annotations over a minimal web interface that conforms to the Representational State Transfer architectural style and uses the JSON for Linking Data representation (JSON-LD). We introduce tools supporting this approach and apply it to several existing annotation clients and servers, demonstrating direct interoperability between tools and resources that were previously unable to exchange information. The specification and tools are available</abstract>

To fully interoperate, annotation tools and resources must agree at least on a way to name and refer to things, an abstract data model, a format capturing that model, and a communication protocol. Here, we suggest a web application programming interface (API) that resolves these questions by building upon web standards and best practices, namely Linked Data principles (Bizer et al., 2009), the Open Annotation data model (Bradshaw et al., 2013) and its serialization as JSON-LD (Sporny et al., 2014), and a minimal HTTP-based protocol adhering to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style (Fielding and Taylor, 2002).

The system was originally developed with a focus on annotating biological entities and concepts such as genes and Gene Ontology terms. The web interface is implemented in JavaScript using the Play framework with Scala. The system is centered on the concept of user projects, each of which holds a corpus of annotated documents.

The first two can be accomplished using any one of the available libraries that implement the full JSON-LD syntax and API specifications.6 To facilitate also validation of conformity to the OA data model, we define the core model of the OA standard using JSON Schema (Galiegue and Zyp, 2013). The JSON Schema community has provided tools in various programming languages for validating JSON against a JSON Schema. The schema we defined is capable of validating data for compliance against JSON-LD and OA Core at the same time. Complementing this support for data validation, we are also developing a standalone tool for testing web services for conformance to the RESTful OA API specification. 4 Adaptation of Existing Tools In addition to creating reference implementations, we have adapted two previously introduced webbased annotation tools to support the API.

Second, the tagtog interface can visualize and edit OA JSON annotations from other OA stores, without a backing tagtog project. Figure 5 shows a sample document annotated in tagtog. 94 4.3 Biomedical entity recognition resources We implemented the API for four large-scale databases of biomedical entity mentions. The COMPARTMENTS database integrates evidence on protein subcellular localization (Binder et al., 2014), and TISSUES and DISEASES similarly integrate evidence on tissue expression and diseaseassociations of human genes, respectively (Santos et al., 2015; Pletscher-Frankild et al., 2015). All three resources include a text mining component based on the highly efficient NER engine used also for detection of species names and names of other taxa in the ORGANISMS database (Pafilis et al., 2014). Together, these databases contain over 123M mentions of genes/proteins, cellular components, tissues and cell lines, disease terms and taxonomic identifiers. This dataset is regularly precomputed for the entire Medline corpus, which currently consists of more than 24M abstracts and 3B tokens. To make this large collection of automatic annotations available as OA JSON-LD, we defined the a</context>

The annotation expresses that the W3C Wikipedia article is related to the W3C homepage. The three resources are all in different domains, and the ”related” relation is not represented explicitly. is an RDF-based graph representation compatible with linguistic annotation formalisms such as LAF/CrrAF (Ide and Suderman, 2007; Verspoor and Livingston, 2012). At its most basic level, the OA model differentiates between three key components: annotation, body, and target, where the annotation expresses that the body is related to the target of the annotation (Figure 1). The body can carry arbitrarily complex embedded data. JSON-LD was recently accepted as a standard RDF serialization format (Sporny et al., 2014) and is the recommended serialization of OA. Every JSON-LD document is both a JSON document and a representation of RDF data. Figure 2 shows an example of a simple annotation using the OA JSON-LD representation.2 { &amp;quot;@id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;/annotations/1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;</context>

Data are stored in a MySQL database and the OA JSON-LD interface uses the standard Python json module for formatting. 5 Related work Our approach builds directly on the OA data model (Bradshaw et al., 2013), which harmonizes the earlier Open Annotation Collaboration (Haslhofer et al., 2011) and Annotation Ontology Initiative (Ciccarese et al., 2011) efforts and is currently developed further under the auspices of the W3C Web Annotation WG.8 Approaches building on RESTful architectures and JSON-LD are also being pursued by the Linguistic Data Consortium (Wright, 2014) and the Language Application Grid (Ide et al., 2014), among others. A number of annotation stores following similar protocols have also been released recently, including Lorestore (Hunter and Gerber, 2012), PubAnnotation (Kim and Wang, 2012), the Annotator.js store9, and NYU annotations10. 6 Conclusions and future work We have proposed to share annotations using a minimal RESTful interface for Open Annotation data in JSON-LD. We introduced reference implementations of a server, client, validation and conversion tools, and demonstrated the integration of several independently developed annotat</context>
