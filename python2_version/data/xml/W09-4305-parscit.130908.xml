<bodyText confidence="0.996455818181818">
This paper examines a new phenomenon in the emergence of
news in Internet. Two key cases have been analyzed. The
first one demonstrates the emergence of news in comments
under the main news; and the second demonstrates the
emergence of news in information-sharing websites and their
interpretation in the newspapers. The research is based on
two small corpora of texts related to these two key cases. The
present study proposes some guidelines for understanding the
information in the dynamic context of Internet and analyzes
some possible ways to extract information from these new
types of texts.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961">
The common understanding is that the newest
information is in the established news media. But
nowadays with the development of electronic media
the real news could appear in the “non-newspapers
texts” like in comments under the news, in blogs or in
social networks. After that the news is immediately
quoted and expanded by news agencies and online
newspapers.
Internet communication removes the distinction
between readers and editors. Editors become readers
and the readers themselves can generate news.
The eighties were marked by the philosophy of
intertextuality. This pre-Internet theory gives an
explanation of what has happened in Internet today: the
representation of any kind of news is often made by
quotations and interpretations of quotations. The
problem with the originality of the text still exists and
simply said the big question is where the information
resides and how it is possible to catch it.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 1
introduces the new types of texts and the quoted news,
Section 2 provides the highlights of the philosophical
theory which is helpful for understanding the new text
types, Section 3 presents the corpora used and gives the
context of the real stories with some definitions of the
news, Section 4 discusses ways to extract information
from corpora and shows some results, Section 5
provides the conclusions and some guidelines for
future work.

2. A piece of philosophy:
Intertextuality and information
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954394736842">
To understand and classify all new emerging text types
on the Internet, this study uses as a basis the
classification made by the French theoretician Gerard
Genette in 1982 [2]. Genette’s construct is based on
literature analysis, without considering the new
phenomenon of Internet but Internet makes the
observations of Genette much clearer. Genette defined
five levels of “transtextuality” (which is conceived as a
complexity of the phemomena related to texts). These
five levels are: hypotext (the text basis), hypertext
(text&apos;s understanding), paratext (title, subtitle, intertitle,
prefaces, postscripts, notes, footnotes, final notes),
metatext (commentaries, literary critique) and
intertexts (relationship between two or more texts,
where the most explicit form is the quotation; it also
includes plagiarism and allusion).
As an example, all these levels can be seen in
Internet websites – the hypotext is the information
which is essential for the user – the text itself, the
hypertext is the user’s previous knowledge about the
current topic, combined with the new knowledge
acquired from the new text, the paratext is represented
in all additional features like the Internet address, the
images and surrounding items including banners and
advertisements, the metatext is represented by all the
comments and links to other sites and texts, and the
intertext is all quoted or misquoted pieces of text. This
study considers the news as the hypotext, the
background of the news as the hypertext, the comments
as the metatext, the temporal information as the
paratext and the links to other news as the metatext.
The concept of intertextuality was first expressed
by the Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin [12] and
came to prominence in the eighties thanks to Julia
Kristeva, who used the term intertextuality for
describing the fact that any text is constructed as a
mosaic of quotations and any text is the absorption and
transformation of other texts [7]. In the present paper

Events in Emerging Text Types (eETTs) - Borovets, Bulgaria, pages 32–37
we consider that “The concept of intertextuality is
based on the notion that texts cannot be viewed or
studied in isolation since texts are not produced or
consumed in isolation. All texts exist and must be
understood in relation with other texts” [1]. The two
analyzed cases prove this phenomenon: the first one
shows how the comments start from the original article
and produce another piece of news; the second one
shows how the news published by a news agency is a
quotation of information taken from other websites. In
fact, unofficial sources of news can also add new
information to stories and in this way develop officially
known stories or even introduce a new story unknown
to the official news agencies. Using unofficial sources
could also help to avoid copyright issues which are a
burden for all the researchers collecting corpora.
Nowadays, the new types of texts are starting to
be considered as a source for news. A well-known
Information Security expert, Nitesh Dhanjani
demonstrated at the last Black Hat computer-security
conference a tool that can search for particular
keywords (such as &amp;quot;fire” and &amp;quot;smoke&amp;quot;) in posts on
Twitter in order to provide an early warning for
emergency responders [8].
The present paper shows that and how the new
types of online texts, such as blogs, information-
sharing websites or comments under the official news
can be used in NLP tasks such as information
extraction, anaphora resolution and text summarization.

3. The real stories and the corpora
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.976078">
3.1. First case: the story
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998976">
The owner of a Bulgarian newspaper publishes on the
website of his own newspaper “the news” that he wants
an official apology from a television channel because
of an insult. Later, in the comments under this main
news, he adds that he will receive the apology. The
important point is that a person who owns a newspaper
and is able to use it prefers to use the comments under
an online news article like a blogger, and not his own
newspaper, in order to publish a particular piece of
news.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.948465">
3.2. Second case: the story
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.633088888888889">
After the presidential elections in Iran in mid-June, a
girl (Neda) is killed during the protests in the street and
her death is filmed by bystanders and broadcasted over
the Internet – in Youtube (www.youtube.com) and
social networks like FaceBook (www.facebook.com)
and Twitter (www.twitter.com). The news is later
reported by all daily online newspapers and the social
networks and the places where it first appeared are
quoted as the official sources.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998386">
3.3. Two corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921">
Two small corpora have been developed for these two
different cases. The first one (10340 words) represents
news published by editors and the postings of bloggers
under it. The posting labels – like the time markers, the
bloggers’ names and the bloggers&apos; moods - are
preserved in the corpora for ease of future processing.
The corpus consists of the official news and 186
comments.
The second corpus (21659 words) is created from
three different types of texts – the videos posted on an
information-sharing website (www.youtube.com), a
blog (of the writer Paulo Coelho), and the results of the
Google News Search engine (which retrieves the news
published in online newspapers).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.905649">
3.4. The news or “there is nothing older
then yesterday’s newspaper”
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927121212121">
In the current study the definition of &apos;news&apos; is very
important. In the theory of journalism &apos;news&apos; is
previously unknown information about a recent and
important event. The problem is how to define what is
previously known and what is not.
Information Extraction (IE) is the sub-area of
NLP which deals with the extraction of news. In
Information Extraction the first of three main tasks is to
determine what are the important types of facts for a
particular domain [4]. Or in other words - to define
what is previously known and what needs to be known.
The other two main tasks for each type of fact
are: determining the various ways in which it is
expressed linguistically; identifying instances of these
expressions in text.
For the task of catching the news, the definition
of &apos;previous knowledge&apos; is also very important. The
temporal information about the comments could be
used as a marker of the news. In our two corpora we
keep the date and the hour from the paratext
information. Furthermore we consider that the newest
information, identified by the latest temporal label,
could be conceived as news.
Information Extraction is the automatic
identification of selected entities, relations or events in
free text [3]. Event Extraction (EE) is a particular type
of IE. EE can be defined as extracting all occurencies
of a relationship between specific participants in an
event from text. In order to capture a particular
relationship between particular participants in a
particular situation, patterns are being built. Usually
attention is focused on identifying and extracting
Named Entities (NEs), such as names of persons,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99517">
33
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99973419047619">
organisations and locations of time markers, people
positions. EE from news articles is usually done by
grouping similar articles into topic clusters based on
statistical word co-occurences.
A further step is tracking the development of news in
time [10,11]. An example of news topic tracking and
news linking over time is the Europe Media Monitor
system (EMM) which groups around 50,000 articles
per day into clusters per topic and per language and
then links daily clusters over time into stories, in this
way tracking news story development over time [10].
In our case IE could be considered as the
technology of extracting the information and the time
label could be conceived as a guarantee for the novelty
of information. In the first case the previous knowledge
is contained in the article published on the website. In
the second case the previous knowledge is in the news
articles on the web about the elections in Iran. Both
cases show how previous knowledge is enriched by
additional information from comments or websites and
how news is created.

4. Text analysis and searching for the
news
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989395">
4.1. First case – general remarks.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998375">
In the first corpus there are texts with different
characteristics: first - an edited journalistic text; second
– the “freestyle” comments of nicknamed people. An
important point is that the post-editing process is easier
in online media – every news article can be improved
in real time. So in our case we analyze the first state of
the article before the emergence of comments and its
further rewrite.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.996008">
4.1.1. The article

participants in the story. For example the extraction of
named entities and the relationships between entities
could provide some additional information – who is
who, who is liked by whom, what somebody did or
didn’t do, etc. But all that additional information will
not be the news, because we consider it to be previous
knowledge.
The names of the newspaper owner and the guest
of the television channel appear more often and are
simple to identify. There are also other people, firms
and organisation names mentioned. An interesting
question is the name co-reference resolution which
could help for future opinion mining.
Below follows an example of the list of proper
names and co-references which are mentioned in the
main news text and used by the bloggers:

references which do not appear in the news texts but
are used by the bloggers:

<bodyText confidence="0.9999084">
A further in-depth linguistic analysis may help the
development of rule-based Information extraction of
comments. Information extraction would improve the
general knowledge about these people and would
facilitate the better understanding of the problem.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.967242">
4.1.3. Newsmakers or bloggers, or both.
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898166666667">
Typically, the article is clearly structured, with clear
simple phrases, with exact quotations and with enough
information for the readers. The published article could
be considered as a well written journalistic text meeting
all requirements. The news is in the first phrase and
additional information follows.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.995586">
4.1.2. The comments
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911136363636">
Grammatically the comments could be distinguished by
the faults – bad constructions, unfinished phrases, etc.
Also, the comments are posted by nicknamed people.
The content of the comments can also be distinguished
by the fact that it is emotional, defending two main
opposite positions – of the newspaper owner or of the
guest of the television channel.
Information extraction and Opinion mining
could help to find more information about the main
In one of the postings, a blogger puts his initial as the
TV guest, and in this way identifies himself as the
representative of the television programme guest. His
comment is a quotation of the letter of the TV guest,
sent as an answer to the accusations of the newspaper
owner.
The linguistic analysis of the text shows that the
first phrase of the posting is not well written from the
point of view of the typical journalistic style – there is
an inversion in the noun phrase, missing information
(to whom/where), ambiguity. The second phrase starts
with a repetition – which is also a fault of style in
Bulgarian. The rules of quotation are also not applied.
</bodyText>

. : „ [...],

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999706875">
The quoted text is well edited and structured. It is
almost an exact quotation of the interview taken from
the television broadcast. The deep content analysis of
that text and the transcript could prove its authenticity.
Unfortunately the intervention of the guest in the
comments is still not news – it is only a comment. The
bad style in the first phrase makes unclear where/to
whom the guest sent this letter, and how this blogger
knows about that – so whether it is true or not.
A little bit later, as the temporal labels show,
another blogger identifies himself as the owner of the
newspaper and adds a piece of news in the comments –
he announces that he will participate in two television
shows to explain the situation and that he already has
the promise of the director of the television channel
that there will be an apology.

<bodyText confidence="0.981782210526316">
The news is introduced by the phrase: “
” (the breaking news of the
last hours is). Here we have some new information,
said in first person, from somebody who claimed to be
the real owner.
After this comment, that announcement is
repeated and quoted by many media. (And finally it
really happened.)
The linguistic analysis of this text shows that
it’s not an edited text – there are two repetitions
( , ) and one
misspelled word ( ). But the important thing in
this comment is the news – the new development of the
event – that there will be an apology.
As was already mentioned, the news in the
website can be easily post-edited. The news about this
apology is post-edited in the same website but after the
comment of the owner, and not before. This shows that
the news is really born in the comments.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.9582">
4.1.4. How much news in the corpus
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990558666666667">
We mentioned the importance of the introductory
phrase. In the corpus of comments there are only two
other postings, conceived as news from the bloggers.
All the other texts are interpretations, analysis and
opinions.
The first comment, which is conceived as news from a
blogger, is formed by an introductory phrase:
:
and the quotation of the news:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9860526">
.
, .
“ ”,
„
”. 26,1% „ ”
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998200666666667">
This news is real and also published in the media, but
here it is like a comment. It will be news for all the
bloggers who don’t know it, but it’s not news emerging
in these comments. The other news is introduced by the
paratext – the nickname of the person is (the
news).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.653188">
1.
!
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999866869565217">
In this case the blogger reproduces in the comment the
announcement of the owner, made a little bit earlier.
This case could be an example of the third main task of
IE – the identification of instances of important
expressions.
The analysis of the corpus shows that the real
news is not very often seen in the comments. In all
186 comments there is only one, which is introduced
by a concrete clear phrase with temporal
identification. The other two examples show different
ways of introducing new information. Further work
with other corpora could make clear how news is
introduced.
In the case shown, the intervention of the owner
and his announcement was easy to identify, thanks to
the paratext markers (time, nickname).
But there are still many different problems here:
whether everyone who presents himself as a particular
person is really the same person; how the reader could
be sure about that; and furthermore - how the automatic
extraction of information has to be made and how
authentic it could be. Another question is how often
such a kind of event development is possible.

web resources. In this part of the study we make an
attempt to reconstruct the emergence of news from the
web, but not from an official news agency source and
news websites. The temporal anchor is June 21 – the
day when the video of Neda’s death appeared in shared
information websites. At the present moment there is
no exact answer about where the video was first
published – on Youtube, in Facebook or in Twitter, but
the important fact is that the video appeared first in a
non-news website and the question is again how to
catch the news from the Internet.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.983">
4.2.2. Event reconstruction and new channels
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99771158974359">
The event reconstruction will give some clues. The
search in news.google.com by keyword “iran” on 21
June doesn’t give the result of Neda. Today these two
words are strongly co-related.
The video of Neda’s death was multiplied in the
postings in the video-sharing websites and, thanks to an
unknown editor, emerged as news. The huge problem
is how to catch such news and the possible answer is to
change our perception and to start considering these
social networks and websites for shared information as
another type of news channel.
The news published by Associated Press on 22 June
2009:
CAIRO (AP) — Amateur video of a young Iranian woman
lying in the street — blood streaming from her nose and mouth —
has quickly become an iconic image of the country&apos;s opposition
movement and unleashed a flood of outrage at the regime&apos;s
crackdown.
The footage, less than a minute long, appears to capture the
woman&apos;s death moments after she was shot at a protest — a powerful
example of citizens&apos; ability to document events inside Iran despite
government restrictions on foreign media and Internet and phone
lines.
The limits imposed amid the unrest over the disputed June
12 election make details of the woman&apos;s life and events immediately
preceding her apparent death difficult to confirm. But clips of the
woman being called Neda are among the most viewed items on
YouTube — with untold numbers of people passing along the
amateur videos through social networks and watching them on
television.
The images entered wide circulation Saturday when two
distinct videos purporting to show her death appeared separately on
YouTube and Facebookj...]
Thousands of people inside and outside Iran have written
online tributes to the woman, many condemning the government and
praising her as a martyr. Some posted photos of a gently smiling
woman they said was Neda, some calling her &amp;quot;Iran&apos;s Joan of Arc.&amp;quot;
The first representation of the news of Neda’s death in
the news agencies shows some interesting facts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.961348285714286">
• Even Associated press is retelling the story of Neda’s
death seen in amateur videos –even highly reputable
media are obliged to use in that case an unverified
information channel.
• The Associated press quoted YouTube and Facebook
as sources – so these two channels are considered to
be information factors.
• The Associated press quoted people inside and
outside Iran who have written online tributes to the
woman – web communication is conceived as
witnesses&apos; stories.
• It is difficult to confirm the event – from the point of
view of journalism&apos;s ethics – where the truth is – this
fact has to be kept in mind.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99965725">
After the acceptance of these channels as news
information media, the next step is how to use these
new channels. We present some of the possible
perspectives of using this new type of media.

4.2.3. Summarization of the information in
Youtube.
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965498833333333">
The search in www.youtube.com of the keyword
“neda” returns a set of titled videos. The collection of
all these titles could be conceived as a kind of
summarization of the real story about the death of Neda
Agha-Soltan.
The collection of titles:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.9796968125">

The manual reconstruction of the extracted titles gives
almost the full story:
Neda Agha Soltan is killed on 20.06.2009, in a presidential election
protest at Tehran. Her fiance tells of Neda&apos;s last moments. She
becomes an Iranian symbol. There are some allegations that Neda is
killed by CIA. There is a Twitter Revolution – Iran. There is a
tribute to Neda – songs, addresses in the Senate.
Such kind of work could be done for many themes.
Thus, further automatic summarization over the results
of the search for some key words can be helpful for the
creation of full information about a concrete topic.
Once different titles of the same video are recognized
to refer to the same story, coreferential chains, and lists
of co-referents relating to the same term can be easily
built. This kind of list can be constructed also from the
different ways of naming the same personages involved

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.993852">
4.2.4. Additional information from blogs
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99909934375">
Additional information about some topics could be
found also in blogs. The videos of Neda’s death are
posted on many private websites and blogs and we
tried to choose randomly one of them which has many
comments in order to make an example of this
possibility. The chosen blog is of the famous Brazilian
writer Paulo Coelho. The post is from 23 June 2009
and his remarks are:
My best friend in Iran, a doctor who showed me its beautiful culture
when I visited Teheran in 2000, who fought a war in the name of the
Islamic Republic (against Iraq), who took care of wounded soldiers
in the frontline, who always stood by real human values, is seen here
trying to resuscitate Neda - hit in her heart.
The obvious conclusions from this piece can be two –
first, the owner of the blog knows one of the persons in
the video – the doctor who tries to help the girl to
survive (in the blog the name of the doctor (Arash
Hejazi) is published on June 26th, 2009 and there is also
an exchange of correspondence between the doctor and
the blog&apos;s owner); second, the video could be true. No
one has announced the name of the doctor until that
moment and no one has proved that the video is real.
Five days later the news agencies announced: Arash
Hejazi is wanted by intelligence ministry and Interpol.
In this case the IE can be used as a technology
for catching important information and could be
enriched with time labels – to identify the news. In
both cases – the newspaper owner’s story and Neda’s
death story - the number of comments and the activity
of bloggers show that these two news are important
(the first - for Bulgaria, the second – for all over the
world).

5. Conclusions and further work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992761904762">
The paper aims to show some of the perspectives of
news emerging in shared web texts. Starting from the
understanding of intertextuality, we presented the
development of the news in two key cases. The main
conclusion is that the shared-information websites,
social network sites, blogs and comments under a
particular article can be without a doubt conceived of
as new news channels.
The Information Extraction technology can help as a
method of catching suitable information from these
new sources. The introduction of time labels as a
guarantee of the novelty of information is helpful to
determine which is real news.
Future work will start with in-depth linguistic
analysis of the news comments and blog posts to show
their differences from classical news articles texts.
Considering news article texts as a form of a controlled
language will help to make this distinction clearer. The
collection of a more representative corpus of new text
types and their analysis should be considered as the
next step.

<abstract confidence="0.999934916666667">This paper examines a new phenomenon in the emergence of news in Internet. Two key cases have been analyzed. The first one demonstrates the emergence of news in comments under the main news; and the second demonstrates the emergence of news in information-sharing websites and their interpretation in the newspapers. The research is based on two small corpora of texts related to these two key cases. The present study proposes some guidelines for understanding the information in the dynamic context of Internet and analyzes some possible ways to extract information from these new types of texts.</abstract>

A piece of philosophy: Intertextuality and information To understand and classify all new emerging text types on the Internet, this study uses as a basis the classification made by the French theoretician Gerard Genette in 1982 [2]. Genette’s construct is based on literature analysis, without considering the new phenomenon of Internet but Internet makes the observations of Genette much clearer. Genette defined five levels of “transtextuality” (which is conceived as a complexity of the phemomena related to texts). These five levels are: hypotext (the text basis), hypertext (text&apos;s understanding), paratext (title, subtitle, intertitle, prefaces, postscripts, notes, footnotes, final notes), metatext (commentaries, literary critique) and intertexts (relationship between two or more texts, where the most explicit form is the</context>

In our two corpora we keep the date and the hour from the paratext information. Furthermore we consider that the newest information, identified by the latest temporal label, could be conceived as news. Information Extraction is the automatic identification of selected entities, relations or events in free text [3]. Event Extraction (EE) is a particular type of IE. EE can be defined as extracting all occurencies of a relationship between specific participants in an event from text. In order to capture a particular relationship between particular participants in a particular situation, patterns are being built. Usually attention is focused on identifying and extracting Named Entities (NEs), such as names of persons, 33 organisations and locations of time markers, people positions. EE from news articles is usually done by grouping similar articles into topic clusters based on statistical word co-occurence</context>

The news or “there is nothing older then yesterday’s newspaper” In the current study the definition of &apos;news&apos; is very important. In the theory of journalism &apos;news&apos; is previously unknown information about a recent and important event. The problem is how to define what is previously known and what is not. Information Extraction (IE) is the sub-area of NLP which deals with the extraction of news. In Information Extraction the first of three main tasks is to determine what are the important types of facts for a particular domain [4]. Or in other words - to define what is previously known and what needs to be known. The other two main tasks for each type of fact are: determining the various ways in which it is expressed linguistically; identifying instances of these expressions in text. For the task of catching the news, the definition of &apos;previous knowledge&apos; is also very important. The temporal information about the comments could be used as a marker of the news.

Using unofficial sources could also help to avoid copyright issues which are a burden for all the researchers collecting corpora. Nowadays, the new types of texts are starting to be considered as a source for news. A well-known Information Security expert, Nitesh Dhanjani demonstrated at the last Black Hat computer-security conference a tool that can search for particular keywords (such as &amp;quot;fire” and &amp;quot;smoke&amp;quot;) in posts on Twitter in order to provide an early warning for emergency responders [8]. The present paper shows that and how the new types of online texts, such as blogs, informationsharing websites or comments under the official news can be used in NLP tasks such as information extraction, anaphora resolution and text summarization. 3.
