It is important to use pattern information (e.g. TV
newscasts) and textual information (e.g. newspa-
pers) together. For this purpose, we describe a
method for aligning articles in TV newscasts and
newspapers. In order to align articles, the align-
ment system uses words extracted from telops in
TV newscasts. The recall and the precision of the
alignment process are 97% and 89%, respectively.
In addition, using the results of the alignment pro-
cess, we develop a browsing and retrieval system for
articles in TV newscasts and newspapers.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849333333333">
Pattern information and natural language informa-
tion used together can complement and reinforce
each other to enable more effective communication
than can either medium alone (Feiner 91) (Naka-
mura 93). One of the good examples is a TV news-
cast and a newspaper. In a TV newscast, events
are reported clearly and intuitively with speech and
image information. On the other hand, in a news-
paper, the same events are reported by text infor-
mation more precisely than in the corresponding
TV newscast. Figure 1 and Figure 2 are examples
of articles in TV newscasts and newspapers, respec-
tively, and report the same accident, that is, the air-
plane crash in which the Commerce Secretary was
killed. However, it is difficult to use newspapers and
TV newscasts together without aligning articles in
the newspapers with those in the TV newscasts. In
this paper, we propose a method for aligning arti-
cles in newspapers and TV newscasts. In addition,
we show a browsing and retrieval system for aligned
articles in newspapers and TV newscasts.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.685972">
2.1 TV Newscasts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984253">
In a TV newscast, events are generally reported in
the following modalities:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999690333333333">
• image information,
• speech information, and
• text information (telops).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999813666666667">
In TV newscasts, the image and the speech infor-
mation are main modalities. However, it is diffi-
cult to obtain the precise information from these
kinds of modalities. The text information, on the
other hand, is a secondary modality in TV news-
casts, which gives us:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98703875">
• explanations of image information,
• summaries of speech information, and
• information which is not concerned with the
reports (e.g. a time signal).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969384615385">
In these three types of information, the first and
second ones represent the contents of the reports.
Moreover, it is not difficult to extract text infor-
mation from TV newscasts. It is because a lots
of works has been done on character recognition
and layout analysis (Sakai 93) (Mino 96) (Sato 98).
Consequently, we use this textual information for
aligning the TV newscasts with the corresponding
newspaper articles. The method for extracting the
textual information is discussed in Section 3.1. But,
we do not treat the method of character recognition
in detail, because it is beyond the main subject of
this study.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987407">
2.2 Newspapers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992944">
A text in a newspaper article may be divided into
four parts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999205">
• headline,
• explanation of pictures,
• first paragraph, and
• the rest.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985">
In a text of a newspaper article, several kinds of
information are generally given in important order.
In other words, a headline and a first paragraph in
a newspaper article give us the most important in-
formation. In contrast to this, the rest in a newspa-
per article give us the additional information. Con-
sequently, headlines and first paragraphs contain
more significant words (keywords) for representing
the contents of the article than the rest.

On the other hand, an explanation of a picture in
an article shows us persons and things in the picture
that are concerned with the report. For example, in
Figure 2, texts in bold letters under the picture is
an explanation of the picture. Consequently, expla-
nations of pictures contain many keywords as well
as headlines and first paragraphs.
In this way, keywords in a newspaper article are
distributed unevenly. In other words, keywords are
more frequently in the headline, the explanation of
the pictures, and the first paragraph. In addition,
these keywords are shared by the newspaper article
with TV newscasts. For these reasons, we align
articles in TV newscasts and newspapers using the
following clues:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999780333333333">
• location of keywords in each article,
• frequency of keywords in each article, and
• length of keywords.

Summary of this article: On Apr 4, the Croatian Government confirmed that Commerce Secretary
Ronald H. Brown and 32 other people were all killed in the crash of a US Air Force plane near the
Dubrovnik airport in the Balkans on Apr 3, 1996. It was raining hard near the airport at that time.
A Pentagon spokesman said there are no signs of terrorist act in this crash. The passengers included
members of Brown&apos;s staff, private business •leaders, and a correspondent for the New York Times.
President Clinton, speaking at the Commerce Department, praised Brown as &apos;one of the best advisers
and ablest people I ever knew.&apos; On account of this accident, Vice Secretary Mary Good was appointed
to the acting Secretary. In the Balkans, three U.S. officials on a peace mission and two U.S. soldiers
were killed in Aug 1995 and Jan 1996, respectively.
(Photo) Commerce Secy Brown got off a military plane Boeing 737 and met soldiers at the Tuzla airport
in Bosnia. The plane crashed and killed Commerce Secy Brown when it went down to Dubrovnik.

3 Aligning Articles in TV
Newscasts and Newspapers
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999962">
3.1 Extracting Nouns from Telops
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98923825">
An article in the TV newscast generally shares many
words, especially nouns, with the newspaper article
which reports the same event. Making use of these
nouns, we align articles in the TV newscast and in
the newspaper. For this purpose, we extract nouns
from the telops as follows:
Step 1 Extract texts from the TV images by hands.
For example, we extract &amp;quot;Okinawa ken Ohia
chijz&amp;quot; from the TV image of Figure 3. When
the text is a title, we describe it. It is not
difficult to find title texts because they have
specific expression patterns, for example, an

<figureCaption confidence="0.7631746">
underline (Figure 4 and a top left picture in
Figure 1). In addition, we describe the follow-

nawa Prefecture)&amp;quot;

ing kinds of information:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998126666666667">
• size of each character
• distance between characters
• position of each telop in a TV image
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999086368421053">
Step 2 Divide the texts extracted in Step 1 into
lines. Then, segment these lines at the point
where the size of character or the distance be-
tween characters changes. For example, the
text in Figure 3 is divided into &amp;quot;Okinawa ken
(Okinawa Prefecture)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ohta (Ohta)&amp;quot;, and
&amp;quot;chiji (Governor)&amp;quot;.
Step 3 Segment the texts by the morphological an-
alyzer JUMAN (Kurohashi 97).
Step 4 Analyze telops in TV images. Figure 5
shows several kinds of information which are
explained by telops in TV Newscasts (Watan-
abe 96). In (Watanabe 96), a method of se-
mantic analysis of telops was proposed and the
correct recognition of the method was 92 %.
We use this method and obtain the semantic
interpretation of each telop.
Step 5 Extract nouns from the following kinds of
telops.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.87771275">
• telops which explain the contents of TV
images (except &amp;quot;time of photographing&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;image data&amp;quot;)
• telops which explain a fact
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99973175">
It is because these kinds of telops may con-
tain adequate words for aligning articles. On
the contrary, we do not extract nouns from
the other kinds of telops for aligning articles.
For example, we do not extract nouns from
telops which are categorized into a quotation
of a speech in Step 4. It is because a quota-
tion of a speech is used as the additional infor-

• articles are created in the electronic form, and
• articles are created by authors using HTML
which offers embedded codes (tags) to desig-

newspaper articles into four parts:
• headline,
• explanation of pictures,
• first paragraph, and
• the rest.

4. Extract the top paragraph as the first para-
graph. The others are classified into the rest.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988965">
3.3 Procedure for Aligning Articles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999560625">
Before aligning articles in TV newscasts and news-
papers, we chose corresponding TV newscasts and
newspapers. For example, an evening TV newscast
is aligned with the evening paper of the same day
and with the morning paper of the next day. We
aligned articles within these pairs of TV newscasts
and newspapers.
The alignment process consists of two steps. First,
we calculate reliability scores for an article in the
TV newscasts with each article in the correspond-
ing newspapers. Then, we select the newspaper ar-
ticle with the maximum reliability score as the cor-
responding one. If the maximum score is less than
the given threshold, the articles are not aligned.
As mentioned earlier, we calculate the reliability
scores using these kinds of clue information:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999942333333333">
• location of words in each article,
• frequency of words in each article, and
• length of words.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9146005">
If we are given a TV news article x and a newspaper
article y, we obtain the reliability score by using the
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9241735">
words k(k = 1 • • • N) which are extracted from the
TV news article x:
SC 0 RE(x , y) =
N 4 2
E E E w(i, j) • fpaper(i, k) • fTv k) • length(k)
k=1 i=1 j=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982769230769">
where w(i, j) is the weight which is given to accord-
ing to the location of word k in each article. We
fixed the values of w(i, j) as shown in Table 1. As
shown in Table 1, we divided a newspaper article
into four parts: (1) title, (2) explanation of pic-
tures, (3) first paragraph, and (4) the rest. Also,
we divided texts in a TV newscasts into two: (1)
title, and (2) the rest. It is because keywords are
distributed unevenly in articles of newspapers and
TV newscasts. fpaper (i, k) and fTv(j, k) are the
frequencies of the word k in the location i of the
newspaper and in the location j of the TV news,
respectively. length(k) is the length of the word k.
</bodyText>

4 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989465">
To evaluate our approach, we aligned articles in
the following TV newscasts and newspapers:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999636">
• NHK evening TV newscast, and
• Asahi newspaper (distributed in the Internet).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999664272727273">
We used 143 articles of the evening TV newscasts
in this experiment. As mentioned previously, arti-
cles in the evening TV newscasts were aligned with
articles in the evening paper of the same day and
in the morning paper of the next day. Figure 7
shows the results of the alignment. In this exper-
iment, the threshold was set to 100. We used two
measures for evaluating the results: recall and pre-
cision. The recall and the precision are 97% and
89%, respectively.
One cause of the failures is abbreviation of words.
For example, &amp;quot;shinyo-kinko (credit association)&amp;quot; is
abbreviated to &amp;quot;shinkin&amp;quot; . In our method, these
words lower the reliability scores. To solve this
problem, we would like to improve the alignment
performance by using dynamic programming match-
ing method for string matching. (Tsunoda 96) has
reported that the results of the alignment were im-
proved by using dynamic programming matching
method.
In this experiment, we did not align the TV news
articles of sports, weather, stock prices, and foreign

exchange. It is because the styles of these kinds of
TV news articles are fixed and quite different from
those of the others. From this, we concluded that
we had better align these kinds of TV news articles
by the different method from ours. As a result of
this, we omitted TV news articles the title text of
which had the special underline for these kinds of
TV news articles. For example, Figure 8 shows a
special underline for a sports news.
5 Browsing and Retrieval System
for Articles in TV Newscasts and
Newspapers
The alignment process has a capability for informa-
tion retrieval, that is, browsing and retrieving arti-
cles in TV newscasts and newspapers. As a result,
using the results of the alignment process, we devel-
oped a browsing and retrieval system for TV news-
casts and newspapers. Figure 9 shows the overview
of the system. The important points for this system
are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.979771166666667">
• • Newspaper articles and TV news articles are
cross-referenced.
• A user can consult articles in TV newscasts
and newspapers by means of the dates of broad-
casting or publishing.
• A user can consult newspaper articles by full
text retrieval. In the same way, user can con-
sult TV newscasts which are aligned with re-
trieved newspaper articles. In other words,
content based retrieval for TV newscasts is
available.
• Newspaper articles are written in HTML. In
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971458461538462">
addition to this, the results of the alignment
process are embedded in the HTML texts. As
a result, we can use a WWW browser (e.g.
Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc) for brows-
ing and retrieving articles in TV newscasts and
newspapers.
A user can consult articles in newspapers and TV
newscasts by full text retrieval in this way: when
the user gives a query word to the system, the sys-
tem shows the titles and the dates of the newspaper
articles which contain the given word. At the same
time, the system shows the titles of TV news articles
which are linked to the retrieved newspaper articles.
For example, a user obtains 13 newspaper articles
and 4 TV news articles when he gives &amp;quot;saishutsu
(annual expenditure)&amp;quot; as a query word to the sys-
tem. One of them, entitled &amp;quot;General annual expen-
diture dropped for three successive years&amp;quot; (June, 4,
1997), is shown in Figure 10. The newspaper article
in Figure 10 has an icon in the above right, looks
like an opening scene of a TV news article. The
icons shows this article is linked to the TV news
article. When the user select this icon, the system
shows the TV news article &amp;quot;Public work costs were
a seven percent decrease&amp;quot; (the top left window in
Figure 10).

<abstract confidence="0.99785325">It is important to use pattern information (e.g. TV newscasts) and textual information (e.g. newspapers) together. For this purpose, we describe a method for aligning articles in TV newscasts and newspapers. In order to align articles, the alignment system uses words extracted from telops in TV newscasts. The recall and the precision of the alignment process are 97% and 89%, respectively. In addition, using the results of the alignment process, we develop a browsing and retrieval system for articles in TV newscasts and newspapers.</abstract>
