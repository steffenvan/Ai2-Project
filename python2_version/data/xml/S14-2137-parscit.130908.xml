In this paper we present our contribution to
SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sen-
timent Analysis (Pontiki et al., 2014), Sub-
task 2: Aspect Term Polarity for Laptop
domain. The most outstanding feature in
this contribution is the automatic building
of a domain-depended sentiment resource
using Latent Semantic Analysis. We in-
duce, for each term, two real scores that in-
dicate its use in positive and negative con-
texts in the domain of interest. The aspect
term polarity classification is carried out
in two phases: opinion words extraction
and polarity classification. The opinion
words related with an aspect are obtained
using dependency relations. These rela-
tions are provided by the Stanford Parser1.
Finally, the polarity of the feature, in a
given review, is determined from the pos-
itive and negative scores of each word re-
lated to it. The results obtained by our ap-
proach are encouraging if we consider that
the construction of the polarity lexicon is
performed fully automatically.

Hundreds of millions of people and thousands
of companies around the world, actively use So-
cial Media2. Every day are more amazing web-
sites and applications (Facebook, Twitter, MyS-
pace, Amazon, etc.) that allow the easy sharing
of information in near real time. For this rea-

volume of information offer both interesting chal-
lenges and useful intelligent applications such as
recommendation systems (Dong et al., 2013; Sun
et al., 2009) and customer’s reviews summariza-
tion (Bafna and Toshniwal, 2013; Balahur and
Montoyo, 2008).
Nowadays, companies have redirected their
marketing strategies toward the Web. Each one
of them advertises that their products are the best,
amazing, easy to use, long lasting and cheap. But
are these advertisements really true? Obviously,
not everything is true. The companies usually ex-
aggerate the product’s quality and in many cases
tend not to advertise the limitations of their prod-
ucts. Therefore, taking a rational decision about
which product is the best among the variety of ex-
isting options can be very stressful.
To avoid this situation, frequently we trust in
the experiences gained by others who have pur-
chased the product of our interest, or one similar.
The existence of websites like Ciao3, Epinions4
and Cnet5 make possible to the customers to inter-
change their experiences about a specific product,
and to future clients avoid products advertising
However, the existence of a large volume of re-
views entails that it is impossible to conduct an
effective exploration before making a final deci-
sion. The most important benefit of having that
amount of user-generated content on hand, specif-
ically product’s reviews, is that, these data can be
explored by a computer system to obtain informa-
tion about products and their features.
The task of aspect-based sentiment analysis
(Liu, 2012) is a fine-grained level of Sentiment
Analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008). This aim to iden-
tify the aspects (e.g., battery, screen, food, ser-
vice, size, weight, time-life) of given target entities

(e.g., laptops, restaurants, camera) and the senti-
ment expressed towards each aspect (e.g., positive,
negative, neutral). This are composed by two ba-
sic phases: feature extraction and feature polarity
classification.
In this paper we present our contribution for
SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment
Analysis (Pontiki et al., 2014), Subtask 2: Aspect
Term Polarity. In this approach we only focus on
the polarity classification problem. For this, we
induce a domain-dependent sentiment lexicon ap-
plying Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on prod-
uct reviews corpus, gathered from Ciao. The clas-
sification phase is carried out as follow: the opin-
ion words related with the product aspect are draw
out using the dependency relations provided by
Stanford Parser, then the polarity of the extracted
words are combined to obtain overall aspect polar-
ity.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de-
scribes our approach. Further on, in Section 3, we
discuss the results obtained in the SemEval 2014
Task No. 4 subtask 2. Finally, section 4 provides
concluding remarks.

One of major challenge in sentiment analysis into
product reviews, is dealing with a quite domain de-
pendence. For instance, the word “unpredictable”
can be considered as positive in Movie domain,
however it is very negative in Airplane domain.
For this reason, we propose to create a specific
sentiment lexicon for addressing aspect based sen-
timent analysis in reviews.
Our proposal is divided in two main phases. The
first one aims to build a domain-dependent senti-
ment resource for Laptop domain applying LSA.
The second phase obtains the words related by
means of some dependency relation with the as-
pect, and later, the polarity of these words are
obtained from induced polarity lexicon and com-
bined for computing overall aspect polarity.

2.1 Domain-Dependent Polarity Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984087719298">
The use of sentiment resource has been proven
to be useful to build, train, and evaluate systems
for sentiment analysis (Guti´errez et al., 2013; Bal-
ahur, 2011). In order to build sentiment resource,
several approach has been presented. In one of
the first works, presented by (Hatzivassiloglou and
McKeown, 1997), was proposed to take into ac-
count if adjectives are linked by adversative or
copulative conjunctions for detecting its polarity.
In (Turney and Littman, 2003) the authors exposed
a method for inferring the semantic orientation of
a word from its statistical association with a set
of positive and negative paradigm words, mea-
sured by point-wise mutual information (PMI). In
(2004), Hu and Liu suggested a technique to ex-
pand the lexicon using the relations of synonymy
and antonym provided by WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998). In (2009), Cruz et al., created a sentiment
resource based on a graph, constructed from con-
junctive expressions between pairs of adjectives,
observed in a review corpus. PageRank algorithm
(Page et al., 1999) was adapted to be used on
graphs with positive and negative edges, in order
to obtain the semantic orientation of words.
Despite the wide range of existing proposals
for resources construction, the results achieved
with them are far from expected. As we have
already seen, in aspect based sentiment analy-
sis, the polarity of a word is heavily dependent
on the domain; and general propose sentiment
resource such as General Inquirer (Stone et al.,
1966), WordNet-Affect(Strapparava and Valitutti,
2004), SentiWordNet(Baccianella et al., 2010) or
HowNet (Dong et al., 2010) do not capture this
dependency. On the other hand, the human anno-
tators can not create specific sentiment resources
for each new product launched to market. There-
fore, propose methods to create these resources is
a challenging task.
In this paper we address this task, presenting a
framework for building domain-dependent senti-
ment resource. Our proposal is compounded of
four phases. (See figure 1).
Firstly, review pages about the product of in-
terest can be retrieved from different websites, for
instance, Ciao, Epinions and Cnet (in this work
we only use reviews from Ciao). This reviews
are parsed and cleaned (this time we use Python
XML Parser6). For each page we extract: pros,
cons, title, full review and rating. In this work we
have only focus on the pros and cons attributes be-
cause they are usually very brief, consist of short
phrases or sentence segments and give a positive
and negative evaluation about the product aspects.
Each pros and cons in remainder paper will be
considered as positive and negative samples, re-
spectively.

Subsequently, the samples are preprocessed,
applying a POS-Tagging tool (Padr´o and
Stanilovsky, 2012) to convert all words in lem-
mas. After that, the stopwords are removed
from text. Afterward each sample is represented
using the classic vector space model (Salton et
al., 1975). Intending to measure the association
between term and class we add a special term to
the vectors. In positive samples the term tpos is
added whereas in the negative samples the term
tneg is aggregated.
Later, we apply a Latent Semantic Analysis
(this time we use, Gensim python package) to cal-
culate the strength of the semantic association be-
tween words and classes. LSA uses the Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze the statis-
tical relationships among words in a corpus.
The first step is construct a matrix Mn×m, in
which the row vectors vi represent lemmas and the
column vectors si the positive and negative sample
(pros and cons). In each cell tij, we have the TF
score (Term Frequency) of the ith lemma in jth
sample. The next step is apply Singular Value De-
composition to matrix Mn×m to decompose it into
a product of three matrices UΣV T , then, we select
the k largest singular values, and their correspond-
ing singular vectors from U and V , obtained an
approximation Mˆ = UkΣkVkT of rank k to orig-
inal matrix Mn×m. After LSA is performed, we
use the new matrix Mˆ to measure the association
between lemmas li and lj computing the cosine
measure between vectors vi and vj, with the equa-
tion 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.999383666666667">
Finally, the polarity lexicon contains lemmas
li and its positive and negative scores. This val-
ues are computed using LSAscore(li, tpos) and
LSAscore(li, tneg) respectively. The table 1 show
some top positive and negative words computed
with this strategy.

With aim to do our contribution to SemEval-
2014, Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
(Pontiki et al., 2014), Subtask 2: Aspect Term Po-
larity, we gathered 3010 Laptop Reviews, from
Ciao and create a corpus with 6020 samples, 3010
positives (Pros) and 3010 negatives (Cons). This
corpus was used as input in the developed frame-
work (See figure 1). In this time we utilize Freel-
inias POS-Tagging tool and Gensim Python
Packages8 to perform LSA (only the most 100
most significant eigenvalue are used). After that,
a domain-dependent sentiment resource (DLSR)
with 4482 term was created for Laptop reviews.

In order to exploit our domain-dependent senti-
ment resource building for Laptop domain, we de-
velop an unsupervised method based on language
rule to classify the product aspect. The basic rules
are used to find dependency relation between as-
pect and their attributes. The figure 2 show the
architecture of our proposal.
The proposed method receive as input a tuple
(Pfeature, R), where Pfeature represent the aspect
to evaluate, and R is the context (review) in it ap-
pears.

The dependency parsed is applied to review R,
using Stanford Parser. Following that, we extract
a set of tuples W, each tuple is represented as a
pair (Att, Mod) where Att is a word related with
the aspect Pfeature through some dependency re-
lations shown in Table 2, and Mod is a integer
value indicating if Att is modified by a valence
shifter (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004), (we only con-
sider negation words, e.g., never, no, not, don’t,
nothing, etc.) , and default value of 0 is assign, in
case that, the Att is modified by a valence shifter,
we assign value of -1.

can be submitted, the first (constrained), the sys-

The most outstanding feature in this contribution is the automatic building of a domain-depended sentiment resource using Latent Semantic Analysis. We induce, for each term, two real scores that indicate its use in positive and negative contexts in the domain of interest. The aspect term polarity classification is carried out in two phases: opinion words extraction and polarity classification. The opinion words related with an aspect are obtained using dependency relations. These relaare provided by the Stanford Finally, the polarity of the feature, in a given review, is determined from the positive and negative scores of each word related to it. The results obtained by our approach are encouraging if we consider that the construction of the polarity lexicon is performed fully automatically.</abstract>

Despite the wide range of existing proposals for resources construction, the results achieved with them are far from expected.

This corpus was used as input in the developed framework (See figure 1). In this time we utilize Freelinias POS-Tagging tool and Gensim Python Packages8 to perform LSA (only the most 100 most significant eigenvalue are used). After that, a domain-dependent sentiment resource (DLSR) with 4482 term was created for Laptop reviews. 2.2 Aspect Polarity Classification In order to exploit our domain-dependent sentiment resource building </context>

Subsequently, the samples are preprocessed, applying a POS-Tagging tool (Padr´o and Stanilovsky, 2012) to convert all words in lemmas. After that, the stopwords are removed from text. Afterward each sample is represented using the classic vector space model (Salton et al., 1975). Intending to measure the association between term and class we add a special term to the vectors. In positive samples the term tpos is added whereas in the negative samples the term tneg is aggregated. Later, we apply a Latent Semantic Analysis (this time we use, Gensim python package) to calculate the strength of the semantic association between words and classes. LSA uses the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze the statistical relationships among words in a corpus. The first step is construct a matrix Mn×m, in which the row vectors vi represent lemmas and the column vectors si th</context>

In order to build sentiment resource, several approach has been presented. In one of the first works, presented by (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), was proposed to take into account if adjectives are linked by adversative or copulative conjunctions for detecting its polarity. In (Turney and Littman, 2003) the authors exposed a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words, measured by point-wise mutual information (PMI). In (2004), Hu and Liu suggested a technique to expand the lexicon using the relations of synonymy and antonym provided by WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). In (2009), Cruz et al., created a sentiment resource based on a graph, constructed from conjunctive expressions between pairs of adjectives, observed in a review corpus.
