It is widely recognized that a question-answering
system should be able to tailor its answers to the user.
One of the dimensions along which this tailoring can
occur is with respect to the level of knowledge of a
user about a domain. In particular, responses should
be different depending on whether they are addressed
to naive or expert users. To understand what those
differences should be, we analyzed texts from adult
and junior encyclopedias. We found that two different
strategies were used in describing complex physical
objects to juniors and adults. We show how these
strategies have been implemented on a test database.

INTRODUCTION

Whether the purpose of a natural language program
is to ease man-machine interactions (Kaplan 82; Hayes
and Reddy 791 or to model human communication
(Lehnert 781, it must take into consideration certain
characteristics of the person engaged in the interaction.
In an interaction between people, the goals, beliefs,
intentions, knowledge and past experience of the
participants will play a role in how they communicate
with each other [Cohen and Perrault 791, [Perrault and
Allen 801. Similarly, those characteristics should play
a role in the way a computer system interacts with a
user. In particular, a question-answering program that
provides access to a large amount of data to many
different users will be most useful if it can tailor its
answers to each user.
We are interested here in how the level of
knowledge (or expertise) of the user affects an answer.
As an example of this kind of tailoring in a naturally
occurring conversation, an explanation of how a car
engine works aimed at a child will be different than
one aimed at an adult, and an explanation adequate
for a music student is probably not quite sufficient for
a student in mechanical engineering.. In this paper, we
study the strategies used in natural language to
describe physical objects to two different types of
users: naive and expert. By naive and expert, we
refer to how familiar a user is about the domain of
the database as opposed to how experienced the user
is with the question/answering system. When the
database is complex, it becomes important to vary the
level and the kind of details included in the answer in
order to provide an answer that. can be best
understood by the user.
We plan to use this distinction in the question-
answering program for RESEARCHER, a system being
developed at Columbia University. RESEARCHER
reads, remembers, and generalizes from patents
abstracts written in English (Lebowitz 831. The
abstracts describe complex physical objects in which
spatial and functional relations are important. Thus,
we are interested in characterizing spatial strategies
that can be used for experts and novices about certain
physical objects. We give details in the paper of the
current implementation of description strategies on a
test database of object descriptions.

OUR DOMAIN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994056423076923">
Our goal is to .characterize some of the strategies
employed to describe complex physical objects and see
whether these strategies are different for naive and
experts users. To investigate this problem, we have
looked at, texts from encyclopedias (both adult and
junior) and high school physics textbooksl. The texts
we have studied are about physical objects performing
a function (such as telephones and telescopes), and
generally do not exceed several paragraphs in length.
These texts make the distinction between naive and
expert readers and have been widely used for a
number of years for those audiences. They provide
examples of different descriptive strategies that actually
occur in natural language. Thus, a question-answering
system should be able to reproduce them-.
Studying texts from encyclopedias gives us the
advantage of being able to compare descriptions of
identical objects aimed at two distinct audiences. On
the average, a younger audience has had less
opportunity to gather experience and knowledge about
any particular domain. Thus a younger audience as a
whole is more naive about a domain than an adult
audience. Hence, these texts give us a good starting
point for studying the differences between the
IWe studied about fifteen examples from each
encyclopedia and textbook.

2Our goal, however, is not to study how effective
these texts are for different human readers.. If further
psychological research shows that .other distinctions are
appropriate, they could be .incorporated. The
distinction based on encyclopedias and textbooks is
.really the only available at this point.

THE TEXTUAL ANALYSIS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997829944444444">
We began by analyzing the different texts using
methods developed by other researchers ( [Hobbs 78a1,
[Hobbs 801, [Mann 841, [McKeown 821). We
decomposed paragraphs in terms of their primitive
rhetorical structure ia an attempt to find a consistent
structure in each group of texts. The analysis showed
the adult encyclopedia descriptions to be mainly in
terms of the sub-parts of the object being described.
These texts can be characterized by one of the textual
structures posited in [McKeown 821, the constituency
schema. This structure is presented in the next
section. On the other hand, no schema or other
organizing structure consistently accounted for the
descriptions in the junior encyclopedia texts In
looking for other types of organizing strategies, we
discovered that the main strategy in describing objects
to a naive user is to trace through the process that
allows the object to perform its function.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.947995">
Strategy for the Adults
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993345857142857">
The descriptions from the adult encyclopedias tend to
follow the pattern established by the constituency
schema, one of the textual structures defined in
[McKeown 821. In her work on natural language
generation, McKeown studied the problems of what to
say and how to organize text coherently. She
examined texts and transcripts, classifying, each
sentence as one of a set of rhetorical predicates&apos;) and
found that some combinations of predicates were more
likely to occur than others. Moreover, for each
discoUrse situation, some combination would be the
most appropriate one. Those standard combinations
were encoded as schemas which are associated with a
particular discourse situation. One of these schemas is
the constituency schema which is used to describe an
object (or concept) in terms of its subparts and their
properties. The constituency schema is shown below**.
(For a given entity, Constituency is the description of
its sub-parts or sub-types, and the attributive predicate
gives properties associated with it.)
3Rhetorical predicates characterize the structural
purpose of a sentence and have been discussed by a
variety of linguists [Grimes 751 [Hobbs 78b1 Some
examples are constituency (description of sub-parts or
sub-types), attributive (providing detail about an entity
or event) and analogy (the malting of an analogy).
4We have altered McKeown&apos;sconstituencv schema
slightly by making the first predicate optional instead
of mandatory: in the texts studied, the main parts of
the object were not necessarilz immediately listed. We
are using McKeown&apos;s notation: 0&amp;quot; indicate optionality,
&amp;quot;/&amp;quot; indicates alternatives, &amp;quot;+_&amp;quot; indicates that the item
may appear 1-n times, and &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; indicates that the item
may, appear 0-n times. Finally, &amp;quot;;&amp;quot; is used to represent
classification of ambiguous propositions.

Consider for example the description of a telephone
from an,. adult encyclopedia [Collier 621 shown in
Figure 1°. In the first sentence, the telephone is
described in terms of its constituency (or sub-parts):
the transmitter, the receiver and the housing. From

receiver in turn is described from sentence 9 to 12,
using both attributive and cause-effect information.
Entries in the junior encyclopedia and high
school text books
In texts aimed toward younger audiences, an object
is mainly described in terms of the functions of its
parts. The description traces through the process
information instead of an enumeration of its sub-parts,
as is usually the case in the adult descriptions. The
parts are mentioned only when they need to be, that
is, when the description of the mechanical process calls
for them. As an example of this phenomenon,
consider the description of a telephone shown in

Another major difference was that the junior

For the Junior, the strategy dictates to follow the
cause-effects links in the knowledge base in order to
trace the process. In our representation, these causual
links are named meta-relations (In the figure, they
are represented by the identifiers 0.4fia. OtEl.A
correspond to the relations, ie the spatial or functional
hnks between entities). The program traces through
the meta-relations, picking the process information as
shown in Figure 4. When a relation can be broken
into substeps, the program then traces through those
sub-steps (see Figure 5).
There are several theoretical issues that need to be
addressed. In our test database, the problem of
deciding in what order relations occur does not arise.
However, for an arbitrary database, knowing where to
begin describing a process may be more difficult.
Similarly, the process may not be as sequential as the
ones we examined so far, and, as a result, we plan on
further study of how to organize the information.
Furthermore, in our test database, we don&apos;t need tc
consider how deep into the substeps the process
description should go, but this issue exists for an
arbitrary database. Finally, we have looked at the
two ends of a spectrum (naive and expert), but, for
users not at either of these ends, we must consider
how to combine these strategies.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990741935484">
It is important to tailor a system&apos;s response to the
level of expertise of the user. By studying texts aimed
at two different levels of readers, we have found that
two different strategies were used in describing
physical objects, depending on whether the description
was for an adult or for a junior. For an adult, an
object is described with its sub-parts and their
properties; for a junior, the description traces through
the mechanical process which renders the object
functional.
The two strategies presented account for the main
differences found between the adult and junior entries.
This turns out not to consist of merely giving more
details for the expert as is often thought [Wallis and
Shortliffe 821. In the adult entries, details given are
mainly about the sub-parts and their properties and
less about the mechanical process involved. When the
process mechanism is mentioned at all, it is done very
briefly. In the junior entries, process mechanism is
more important than sub-parts and given in more
detail. Parts are introduced either after or at the
same time as their function is defined, and, as a
consequence, are always defined when presented.
Furthermore, since the process mechanism follows every
step of the causal chain, descriptions for the novice
tend to include more detail about functional
information than descriptions for the expert. We have
shown how formalization of the strategies allows for
the development of question-answering systems which
can tailor their responses tqnthe user, given his level of
expertise about the domain&amp;quot;.

<abstract confidence="0.999571307692308">It is widely recognized that a question-answering should be able to tailor to the user. One of the dimensions along which this tailoring can occur is with respect to the level of knowledge of a user about a domain. In particular, responses should be different depending on whether they are addressed to naive or expert users. To understand what those differences should be, we analyzed texts from adult and junior encyclopedias. We found that two different strategies were used in describing complex physical objects to juniors and adults. We show how these strategies have been implemented on a test database.</abstract>
