observations of natural conversations. People&apos;s
spontaneous use of analogies provides insight into their
implicit evaluation procedures for analogies. The
treatment here, therefore, reveals aspects of analogical
processing that is somewhat more difficult to see in an
experimental context. The work involves explicit
treatment of the discourse context in which analogy
occurs. A major focus here is the formalization of the
effects of analogy on discourse development. There is
much rule-like behavior in this process, both in
underlying thematic development of the discourse and in
the surface linguistic forms used in this development.
Both these forms of regular behavior are discussed- in
terms of a hierarchical structuring of a discourse into
distinct, but related and linked, context spaces.

There are several interesting things happening in this
exchange. For example, notice that the analogy is argued
and discussed by the conversants, and that in the
argumentation C uses the close discourse deictic &amp;quot;these&amp;quot;
to refer to the initiating subject of the analogy, and
that she uses the far discourse deictic &amp;quot;there&amp;quot; to refer
to the linearly closer analogous utterances. In
addition, notice that C bases her rejection on a non-
correspondence of relations effecting the relation
claimed constant between the two domains (women being
sold). She does not simply pick any arbitrary non-
correspondence between the two domains. In the body of

2 The Context Space Theory of Discourse
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979887454545455">
A close analysis of spontaneous dialogues reveals that
discourse processing is focused and enabled by a
conversant&apos;s ability to locate 4 single frame of
reference (19, 15, 16) for the discussion. In effective
communication, listeners are able to identify such a
frame of reference by partitioning discourse utterances
into a hierarchical organization of distinct but related
and linked context oaces. At any given point, only some
of these context spaces are in the foreground of
discourse. Foregrounded context spaces provide the
needed reference frame for subsequent discussion.
An abstract process model of discourse
generation/interpretation incorporating a hierarchical
view of discourse has been designed using the formalism
of an Augmented Transition Network (ATN) (29)2. The
grammar encoding the context space theory (20, 22] views
a conversation as a sequence of conversational moves.
Conversational moves correspond to a speaker&apos;s
communicative goal vis-A-vis a particular preceding
section of discourse. Among the types of conversational
moves - speaker communicative goals - formalized in the
grammar are: Challenge, Support, Future-Generalization,
and Further-Development.
The correlation between a speaker&apos;s utterances and a
speaker&apos;s communicative goal in the context space grammar
is somewhat similar to a theory of speech acts A la
Austin, Searle, and Once (1, 24, 9]. As in the speech
act theory, a speaker&apos;s conversational move is recognized
as a functional communicative act [4] with an associated
set of preconditions, effects, and mode of fulfillment.
However, in the context space approach, the acts
recognized are specific to maxim-abiding thematic.
conversational development, and their preconditions and
effects stem from the discourse structure (rather than
from/on arbitrary states in the external world).
All utterances that serve the fulfillment of a single
communicative goal are partitioned into a single
discourse unit - called a context space. A context space
characterizes the role that its various parts play in the
overall discourse structure and it explicates features
relevant to &amp;quot;well-formednesa&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;maxim-abiding&amp;quot;
discourse development. Nine types of context spaces have
been formalized in the grammar representing the different
constituent types of a discourse. The spaces are
characterized in much the same way as elements of a
&amp;quot;Systemic Grammar&amp;quot; A la Halliday [10] via attributes
represented as &amp;quot;slots&amp;quot; per Minsky [14]. All context
spaces have slots for the following elements:
2The rules incorporated in the grammar by themselves do
not form a complete system of discourse
generation/interpretation. Rather, &apos; they enable
specification of a set of high level Semantic/logical
constraints that a surface linguistic from has .to meet in
order to fill a certain mi,abiding conversational role
at a given point in the discourse.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971725333333334">
o links to preceding context spaces in relation to
which this context space was developed;
o specification of the relations involved.
An equally important feature of a context space are its
slots that hold the inferred components needed to
recognize the communicative goal that the space serves in
the discourse context. There are various ways to fulfill
a given communicative goal, and usually, dependent on the
mode of fulfillment and the goal in question, one can
characterize a set of standardized implicit components
that need to be inferred. For example, as noted by
investigators of argumentation (e.g., [26, 23, 5, 22]),
in interpreting a proposition as supporting another, we
often need to infer 3020 set of mappings between an
inferred generic principle of support, the stated
proposition of support, and the claim being supported.
We must also infer 3020 general rule of inference that
allows for conclusion a claim given the explicit
statements of support and these inferred components.
Reflecting this standardization of inferential
elaborations, / have categorized different types of
context spaces !need on communicative goal and method
fulfillment characterizations (i.e., specification of
specific slots needed to hold the standardized
inferential elaborations particular to a given goal and
mode of fulfillment). Delineation of context spaces,
then, is functionally based, and in the context space
grammar, implicit components of a move are treated as
much a part of the discourse as those components verbally
expressed.

3 The Analogy Conversational Move

<bodyText confidence="0.99488">
Interpreting/understanding an analogy obviously involves
some inferencing on the part of a listener. An analogous
context space, therefore, has some slots particular to
it. The grammar&apos;s characterization of an analogous
context space is derivative from its formal analysis of
an analogy conversational move.

3.1 Th* Structure-Aapping Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990803125">
Identification of those aspects of knowledge considered
important in analogy seems to be of major concern in
current investigation of this cognitive tank
(e.g.. (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 18, 25, 28]).
Gentner&apos;e 2tructure-Manning theory [6, 7, 8] 3000S most
compatible with the findings of the context space
approach. Gentner argues that analogies are based on an
implicit understanding that &amp;quot;identical operations and
relationships hold among non identical things. The
relational structure is preserved, but not the
objects&amp;quot; [8, p.4].
Gentner&apos;s analysis can be used to explain B&apos;s analogy
between the Hindu and Western traditions in Excerpt 1.
The relation MEN BUYING WOMAN. FOR SOME COMPANION FUNCTION
is held constant between the two domains, and the
appropriateness of the analogy 13 not affected, for
instance, by the noncorresponding political views and/or
religions of the two societies.
While Gentner cuts down on the number of correspondences
that must exist between two domains for an analogy to be
considered good, she still leaves open a rather wide set
of relations that must seemingly be matched between a
base and target domain. We need some way to further
characterize just those relations that must be mapped.
For example, the relation TRADING WITH CHINA is totally
irrelevant to the Hindu-Western analogy in this discourse
context. As noted by Lakoff &amp; Johnson [12], metaphors
simultaneously &amp;quot;highlight&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hide&amp;quot; aspects of the two
domains being mapped onto each other. The context space
theory supplements both Lakoff &amp; Johnson&apos;s analysis and
the structure-mapping approach in its ability to provide
relevant relation characterization. .

3.2 The Context Space Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99624675">
In the context space theory, three elements are
considered vital to analogy evaluation:
o the structure mapping theory
o relevant context identification
O communicative goal identification
The context space grammar&apos;s analysis of analogies can be
characterized by the following:
Explicating the connection between an utterance
purporting to make a claim analogous to another rests on
recognizing that for two propositions to be analogous, it
must be the case that they can both be seen as inatan=
of some more general claim, such that the predicates of
all three propositions are identical (i.e., relation
identity), and the correspondent objects of the two
domains involved are both subsets of 3020 larger set
specified in this more general claim.
Rejecting an analogy is based on specifying 30110
relation, RI, of one domain, that one implies (or claims)
is not true in the other; or is hazed on specifying 3020
non-identical attribute-value pair from which such a
relation, RI, can be inferred. In both cases, RI must
itself stand in a &apos;CAUSE&apos; relation (or some other such
relation3) with one of the relations explicitly mentioned
in the creation of the analogY (i.e., one being held
constant between the two domains, that we can call RC).
Furthermore, it must be the case that the communicative
goal of the analogy hinges on RI(RC) being true (or not
true) in both of the domains.

Reflecting this analysis or analogies, all analogous
context spaces have the following slot definitions (among
others).
Abstract: This slot contains the generic
proposition, P, of which the initiating
and analogous claims are instances.
Reflecting the fact that the same
predication must be true of both claims,
3since according to this analysis the prime focal point
of the analogy is always the relations (i.e., &amp;quot;actions&amp;quot;)
being held constant, and a major aspect of an &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; is
its 381130 (reason, intent, or effect of occurrence), a
monoorrespondence in one of these relations will usually
invalidate the point of the analogy.

In maxim-abiding discourse, only elements felt to be
directly analogous or contrastive to elements contained
in the initiating context space are discussed in the
analogous space&amp;quot;. Analogy construction entails a local
shift in topic, and, therefore, in general, after
discussion of the analogous space (including its
component parts, such as &amp;quot;supports-of,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;challenges-of,&amp;quot;
etc.), we have immediate resumption of the initiating
context spice. (When analogies are used for goals 4 &amp; 5
noted above, if the analogy is accepted, then there need
not be a return to the initiating space.)

digressions.

R3: FOREIGN INVASION
R4: AID AGAINST FOREIGN INVASION
R5: CAUSE

<bodyText confidence="0.994385409090909">
Where, R5 is a relation between relations, i.e., R3 CAUSE
R45.
The purpose of M&apos;s analogy is to highlight her negative
assessment of England in the Ireland situation (as
identified by her utterance, &amp;quot;And, what&apos;s made it worse
this time ...&amp;quot;). M attempts to accomplish this by
mapping the presumed acknowledged negative assessment of
America in Vietnam onto England. Such a negative
evaluative mapping, however, can only occur of course if
one condemns America&apos;s involvement in Vietnam. N denies
such a presummed negativity by arguing that it is
possible to view America&apos;s involvement in Vietnam aa
coming to the aid of a country under foreign attack°
(i.e., as a positive rather than a negative act).
Thus, argues N, the &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot; relations of the acts being
held constant between the two domains (i.e., enterance as
a police force but being partisan) are quite different in
the two cases. And, in the Vietnam case, the cause of
the act obviates any common negativity associated with
such &amp;quot;unfair police force treatment.&amp;quot; There is no
negativity of America to map onto England, and the whole
purpose of the analogy has failed. Hence, according to

<bodyText confidence="0.98619576056338">
and R2. Alternatively, it could be thought of as
replacing R1 and R2, since when one country invades
another, we do not usually consider third party
intervention as mere &amp;quot;coming in as a police force and
taking the side of,&amp;quot; but rather as an entrance into an
ongoing war. However, I think in one light one can view
the relations of R1 and R2 holding in either an internal
or external war.
6Most criticisms of America&apos;s involvement in Vietnam
rest on viewing it as an act of intervention in the
internal affairs of a country against the will of half of
its people.
N, the analogy in this discourse context is vacuous and
warrants rejectionT.
After N&apos;S rejection o4 M&apos;s analogy, and N&apos;s offering or
an alternative analogy°, which is somewhat accepted by H-
as predicted by the grammar&apos;s analysis of an analogy
conversational move used for purposes of
evaluation/justification, it is time to have the
initiating subject of the analogy returned-to (i.e., it
is time to return to the subject of Britain&apos;s moving into
Ireland)
The return, on Line 28, in the form of &amp;quot;Further-
Development,&amp;quot; constitutes a subordinating shift from
discussion of the event of the British army entering
Ireland onto discussion of England&apos;s underlying
motivations and reasons for engaging in this event.
The form of return illustrates Lakoff &amp; Johnson&apos;s notion
of a metaphor creating new meanings for 143, and its
ability to &amp;quot;induce new similarities&amp;quot; [12]. That is, it
exemplifies a conversant&apos;s attempt to map new knowledge
onto pre-existing knowledge of a domain based upon, and
induced by, an analogy made to this domain. An
appropriate extended paraphrase of N&apos;s question on Line
28 is: &amp;quot;Okay, 30 we accept Syria&apos;s presence in Lebanon
as a better analogy for England&apos;s presence in Ireland.
Now, we know, or have just shown that Syria&apos;s bias to the
Moalems can be explained by the fact that Syria herself
is Moslem. It has been stated that England, in a similar
situatipp, is favoring Protestants. Can we then carry
motives &apos;w over as well in the analogy? That is, can we
then infer that England is favoring the Protestants
became she is Protestant?&amp;quot;
TIn a different context, perhaps, i.e., had the analogy
been cited for a different purpose, N may have accepted
it. In addition, it is important to recognize that
though there are numerous other non-correspondences
between the American-Vietnam and England-Ireland
situations (e.g., the respective geographic distances
involved), N&apos;s random selection of any one of these other
noncorresponding relations (irrespective of their
complexity) would not have necessarily led to effective
communication or a reason to reject the analogy.
8.,
a 3 citing of this alternative analogy is supportive
of the grammar&apos;s analysis that the purpose of an analogy
is vital to its acceptance, since, it happens that N
views Syria&apos;s intervention in Lebanon quite negatively:
thus, her choice of this domain where (in her view) there
is plenty of negativity to map.
9Notice, by the way, that in terms of &amp;quot;attribute
identity,&amp;quot; America is a such closer match to England than
Syria is. This example supports the theory that
&amp;quot;attribute identity&amp;quot; plays a minimal role in analogy
mappings.
10The fact that N attempts to map a &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot; relation
between the two domains, further supports the theory that
it is correspondence of sohematization of relations
between domains, rather than object identity, that 13 a

4 Surface Linguistic Phenomena
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991860790697675">
The rules of reference encoded in the context space
grammar do not complement traditional pronominalization
theories which are based on criteria of recency and
resulting potential semantic ambiguities. Rather, the
rules are more in line with the theory proposed by Olson
who states that &amp;quot;words designate, signal, or specify an
intended referent relative to the set of alternatives
from which it must be differentiated&amp;quot; [17, p.264]. The
context space grammar is able to delineate this set of
alternatives governing a speaker&apos;s choice (and listener&apos;s
resolution) of a referring expression&amp;quot; by continually
updating its model of the discourse based on its
knowledge of the effects associated with different types
of conversational moves.
Its rule of reference, relevant to current discussion,
is:
o Only elements in a currently active and
controlling context space pair are in the set of
alternatives vying for pronominal and close
deictic referring expressions.
The context space grammar continually updates its model
of the discourse so that at any given point it knows
which preceding utterances are currently in the active
and controlling context spaces. Discourse model updating
is governed by the effects of a conversational move.
Major effects of most conversational moves are:
o changes to the influential statuses of preceding
context spaces;
o Close the analogous context space (denoting that
the space no longer plays a foreground discourse
role);
o reinstantiate the initiating context space as
Active.
Excerpt 3 illustrates how the grammar&apos;s rule of reference
and its updating actions for analogies explain some
seeming surprising surface linguistic forms used after an
analogy in the discourse. The excerpt is taken from an
informal conversation between two friends. In the
discussion, G is explaining to J the workings of a
particle accelerator. Under current discussion is the
cavity of the accelerator through which protons are sent
and accelerated. Particular attention should be given to

especially, quantified sets).
On Line 9, G refers to the &amp;quot;electrostatic potential&amp;quot; last
mentioned on Line 3 with the unmodified, close deictic
referring expression &amp;quot;the potential,&amp;quot; despite the fact
that interveningly on Line 5 he had referenced
&amp;quot;gravitational potential,&amp;quot; a potential semantic
contender for the unmodified noun phrase. In addition, G
uses the close deictic &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; to refer to context space
Cl, though in terms of linear order, context space C2,
the analogous context space, is the closer context space.
Both these surface linguistic phenomena are explainable
and predictable by the context space theory. Line 8
fulfills the discourse expectation of resumming
discussion of the initiating context space of the
analogy. As noted, the effects of such a move are to
close the analogous context space (here, C2) and to
reassign the initiating space (here, Cl) an active
status. As noted, only elements of an active or
controlling context space are viable contenders for
pronominal and close deictic references; elements of
closed context spaces are not. Hence, despite criteria
of recency and resulting potentials of semantic
ambiguity, G&apos;s references unambiguously refer to elements
of Cl, the active foregrounded context space in the
discourse model.
As a second example of speakers using close deictics to
refer to elements of the initiating context space of an
analogy, and corresponding use of far deicties for
elements of the analogous space, lets re-consider Excerpt

Lines 1 - 5: Context Space Cl, The Initiating Space.
Lines 5 - 8: Context Space C3, The Analogous Space.
Lines 9 - 11: Context Space C3, The Challenge Space.
On Line 9, C rejects H&apos;s analogy (aa signalled by her use
of the clue words, &amp;quot;No, but&amp;quot;) by citing a
noncorrespondence of relations between the two domains.
Notice that in the rejection, C uses the far deictic
&amp;quot;there&amp;quot; to refer to an element of the linearly close
analogous context space, C2,I3 and that she uses the
close deictic &amp;quot;these&amp;quot; to refer to an Rlement of the
linearly far initiating context space, C114.
The grammar models C&apos;s move on Line 9 by processing the
&amp;quot;Challenge-Analogy-Mappinga&amp;quot; (CAM) conversational move
defined in its discourse network. This move is a
subcategory of the grammar&apos;s Challenge move category.
Since this type of analogy challenge entails contrasting
conatitRente of both the initiating and analogous context
spaces &apos;7, the grammar must decide which of the two spaces
should be in a controlling status, i.e., which space
should serve as the frame of reference for subsequent
processing. Reflecting the higher influential status of
the initiating context space, the grammar chooses it as
its reference framelb.
As such, on its transition path for the CAM move, move,
the grammar:
13Tbia conversation was recorded in Switzerland, and in
terms of a locative use of deicties, Western society is
the closer rather than Hindu society. Thus, the choice
of deictic cannot be explained by appeal to external
reference criteria.
14Notice, however, that C does not use the close
deictic &amp;quot;here,&amp;quot; though it is a better contrastive term
with &amp;quot;there&amp;quot; than is &amp;quot;these.&amp;quot; The rule of &apos;ming close
deictics seems to be slightly constrained in that if the
referent of &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; is a location, and the speaker is not
in the location being referenced, then, s/he cannot use
&amp;quot;here.&amp;quot;
15In a different type of analogy challenge, for
example, one could simply deny the truth of the analogous
utterances.
16In the cases of Pre-Generalization and Topic -
Contrast-Shift analogies, it is only after the analogy
has been accepted that the analogous space is allowed to
usurp the foreground role of the initiating context
space.
o puts the currently active context space (i.e.,
the analogous context space) in a Generating
state (reflecting its new background role);
• leaves the initiating space in its Controlling
state (i.e., it has been serving as the
reference frame for the analogy);
o creates a new Active context space in which to
put the challenge about to be put forward.
Performing such updating actions, and using its rule that
only elements in a controlling or active space are viable
contenders for close deictic and pronominal references,
enables the grammar to correctly model, explain, and
predict C93 reference forms on Lines 9 - 11 of the
excerpt.

within spontaneous dialogues. In order to do this I
first proposed a context space model of discourse. In
the model discourse utterances are partitioned. into
discrete discourse units based on the communicative goal
that they serve in the discussion. All communicative
acts effect the preceding discourse context and I have
shown that by tracking these effects the grammar can
specify a frame of reference for subsequent discussion.
Then, a structure-mapping approach to analogies was
discussed. In this approach it is claimed that the focus
of an analogy is on systems of relationships between
objects, rather than on attributes of objects. Analysis
of naturally occurring analogies supported this claim. I
then showed that the context space theory&apos;s communicative
goal analysis of discourse enabled the theory to go
beyond the structure-mapping approach by providing a
further specification of which kinds of relationships are
most likely to be included in description of an analogy.
&apos;LAstly, I presented a number of excerpts taken from
naturally ongoing discourse and showed how the context
space analysis provided a cogent explanation for the
types of analogies found in discourse, the types of
rejections given to them, the rule-like thematic
development of a discourse after an analogy, and the
surface linguistic forms used in these development.
In conclusion, analyzing speakers spontaneous generation
of analogies and other conversante reactions to them,
provides us an usually direct form by which access
individuals&apos; implicit criteria for analogies. These
exchanges reveal what conversants believe analogies are
responsible for and thereby what information they need to
convey.

<abstract confidence="0.998691">This paper presents an analysis of analogies based on observations of natural conversations. People&apos;s spontaneous use of analogies provides insight into their implicit evaluation procedures for analogies. The treatment here, therefore, reveals aspects of analogical processing that is somewhat more difficult to see in an experimental context. The work involves explicit treatment of the discourse context in which analogy occurs. A major focus here is the formalization of the effects of analogy on discourse development. There is much rule-like behavior in this process, both in underlying thematic development of the discourse and in the surface linguistic forms used in this development. these forms of regular behavior are in terms of a hierarchical structuring of a discourse into distinct, but related and linked, context spaces.</abstract>
