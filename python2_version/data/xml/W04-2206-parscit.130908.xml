Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999877416666667">
We present a method that uses alternation data
to add new entries to an existing bilingual valency
lexicon. If the existing lexicon has only one half of
the alternation, then our method constructs the
other half. The new entries have detailed infor-
mation about argument structure and selectional
restrictions. In this paper we focus on one class
of alternations, but our method is applicable to
any alternation. We were able to increase the
coverage of the causative alternation to 98%, and
the new entries gave an overall improvement in
translation quality of 32%.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994745043478261">
Recently, deep linguistic processing, which aims
to provide a useful semantic representation, has
become the focus of more research, as parsing
technologies improve in both speed and robust-
ness (Uszkoreit, 2002). In particular, machine
translation systems still mainly rely on large
hand-crafted lexicons. The knowledge acquisition
bottleneck, however, remains: precise grammars
need information-rich lexicons, such as valency
dictionaries, which are costly to build and extend.
In this paper, we present a method of adding new
entries to an existing bilingual valency dictionary,
using information about verbal alternations.
The classic approach to acquiring lexical infor-
mation is to build resources by hand. This pro-
duces useful resources but is expensive. This is
still the approach taken by large projects such
as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or OntoSem.
Therefore, there is a need to extend these hand-
made resources quickly and economically. An-
other approach is to attempt to learn informa-
tion from corpora. There has been much research
based on this, but due to the inevitable errors,
there are few examples of lexicons being con-
structed fully automatically. Korhonen (2002)
reports that the ceiling on the performance of
mono-lingual subcategorization acquisition from
corpora is generally around 80%, a level that
still requires manual intervention. Yet another
approach is to combine knowledge sources: for
example to build a lexicon and then try to ex-
tend it using corpus data or to enrich mono-
lingual data using multilingual lexicons (Fujita
and Bond, 2002).
The aim of this research is not to create a
lexicon from scratch, but rather to add further
entries to an existing lexicon. We propose a
method of acquiring detailed information about
predicates, including argument structure, seman-
tic restrictions on the arguments and transla-
tion equivalents. It combines two heterogeneous
knowledge sources: an existing bilingual valency
lexicon (the seed lexicon), and information about
verbal alternations.
Most verbs have more than one possible argu-
ment structure (subcat). These can be regular-
ized into pairs of alternations, where two argu-
ment structures link similar semantic roles into
different subcats. Levin (1993) has identified over
80 alternation types for English, and these have
been extended to cover 4,432 verbs in 492 classes
(Dorr, 1997). In this paper, we will consider al-
ternations between transitive (Vt) and intransi-
tive (Vi) uses of verbs, where the subject of the
intransitive verb (S) is the same as the object of
the transitive verb (O) (e.g. the acid dissolved
the metal &lt;---&gt; the metal dissolved (in the acid))
(Levin, 1993, 26–33)). We call the subject of the
transitive verb A (ergative) and this alternation
the S=O alternation.
Figure 1 shows a simplified example of an alter-
nating pair in a bilingual valency dictionary (the
valency lexicon from the Japanese-to-English ma-
chine translation system ALT-J/E (Ikehara et
al., 1991)). This includes the subcategorization
frame and selectional restrictions. As shown in
Figure 1, Japanese, unlike English, typically mor-
phologically marks the transitivity alternation.
We chose the S=O alternation because it is one

2 Resources
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999805384615384">
We use two main resources in this paper: (1) a
seed lexicon of high quality hand-made valency
entries; and (2) lists of verbs that undergo one or
more S=O alternations.
The alternation list includes 449 native
Japanese verbs that take the S=O alterna-
tion, based on data from Jacobsen (1981), Bul-
lock (1999) and the Japanese/English dictionary
EDICT (Breen, 1995). Each entry consists of a
pair of Japanese verbs with one or more English
glosses. Expanding out the English results in 839
Japanese-English pairs in all. Some examples are
given in Table 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.999901818181818">
As a seed lexicon, we use the valency dictio-
nary (Ikehara et al., 1997) from the Japanese-to-
English machine translation system ALT-J/E. It
consists of linked pairs of Japanese and English
verbs. There are 5,062 Japanese verbs and 11,214
entries (ignoring all idiomatic and adjectival en-
tries). Verb entries in both languages have infor-
mation about the argument structure (subcat) of
the verb. In addition to the core arguments, ad-
junct cases are added to many patterns to help
in disambiguation.l The Japanese side has selec-

tional restrictions (SR) on the arguments. The
arguments are linked between the two languages
using case-roles (N1, N2, . . . ).
The seed lexicon covered 381 out of the 449
linked Japanese pairs (85%). In the next section,
in order to examine the nature of the alternation
we compare the case roles and translation of the
linked valency pairs.

3 The Nature of the S=O Alternation
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9996915">
3.1 Comparing Selectional Restrictions
of A, O and S
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.920347321428571">
In alternations, a given semantic role typically
appears in two different syntactic positions: for
example, the DISSOLVED role is the subject of in-
transitive dissolve and the object of the transi-
tive. Baldwin et al. (1999) hypothesized that
selectional restrictions (SRs) stay constant in the
different syntactic positions. Dorr (1997), who
generates both alternations from a single underly-
ing representation, implicitly makes this assump-
tion. In addition, Kilgarriff (1993) specifically
makes the A (+sentient, +volition), while the
O is (+changes-state, +causally affected).
However, we know of no quantitative studies
of the similarities of alternating verbs. Exploit-
ing the machine translation lexicon for linguistic
research, we compare the SRs of S with both A
and O for verbs that take the S=O alternation.
The SRs take the form of a list of seman-
tic classes, strings or *. Strings only match
specific words, while * matches anything, even
non-nouns. The semantic classes are from the
GoiTaikei ontology of 2,710 categories (Ikehara
et al., 1997). It is an unbalanced hierarchy with
a maximum depth of 12. The top node (level 1)
is noun. The lower the level, the more specialized
LEX (Grishman et al., 1998). For example, the COMLEX
3.0 entry for gather notes that it coocurs with PPs headed
by around, inside, with, in and into.

the meaning, and thus the more restrictive the
SR.
We calculate the similarity between two SRs as
the minimum distance (MD), measured as links
in the ontology. If the SRs share at least one se-
mantic class then the MD is zero. In this case,
we further classified the SRs which are identi-
cal into “0 (Same)”. For example, in Figure 1,
the MD between S and O is “0 (Same)” because
they have the same SR: (stuff). The MD be-
tween A and S is two because the shortest path
from (artifact) to (stuff) traverses two links
(artifact C inanimate C stuff).2
Figure 2 shows the MD between O and S, and
A and S. The selectional restrictions are very sim-
ilar for O and S. 30.1% have identical SRs, dis-
tance is zero for 27.5% and distance one is 28.3%.
However, for A and S, the most common case
is distance one (26.7%) and then distance two
(21.5%). Although O and S are different syntac-
tic roles, their SRs are very similar, reflecting the
identity of the underlying semantic roles.

Restrictions

<bodyText confidence="0.984164571428571">
Next, we examine whether A, O, and S
are (+sentient, +volition) or not. In the
GoiTaikei hierarchy, semantic classes subsumed
by agent are (+sentient, +volition). A was
very agentitive, with 60.1% of the SRs being sub-
sumed by agent. The most frequent SR for A is
(agent) itself (41.4%). S and O are less agenti-
tive, with 13.9% and 14.1% of their respective se-
lectional restrictions being agentitive. This data
supports the hypothesis in Kilgarriff (1993).
2There is some variation due to lexicographer’s incon-
sistencies. For example X’s SR is (stuff) in the intransi-
tive and (inanimate) in the transitive entry. It should be
(stuff) in both entries.

In summary, the SRs of S and O are not iden-
tical, but very similar. In comparison, A is more
agentitive, and not closely linked to either.

3.2 Comparison of Japanese and English
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997285714286">
From the point of view of constructing bilingual
lexical entries, if the English main verb can trans-
late both Japanese entries, then it is possible to
automatically construct a usable English transla-
tion equivalent along with the Japanese alterna-
tion. In order to see how often this is the case, we
compare Japanese and English alternations and
investigate the English translations in the alter-
nation list.
We divide the entries into five types in Ta-
ble 2. The first three are those where the main
English verb is the same. The most common
type (30.0%) is made up of English unaccusative
verbs which also undergo the S=O alternation
[S=O]. The next most common (19.8%) is en-
tries where the Japanese intransitive verb can be
translated by making the transitive verb’s En-
glish translation passive [passive]. In the third
type (6.5%) the English is made transitive syn-
thetically [synthetic]: a control verb (normally
make) takes an intransitive verb or adjective as
complement. The last two are those where ei-
ther different translations are used (42.8%), or
the same English verb is used but the valency
change is not one of those described above.
The first three rows of Table 2 show the verbs
whose alternate can be created automatically,
56.3% of the total. This figure is only an ap-
proximation, for two reasons. The first is that
the translation may not be the best one, most
verbs can have multiple translations, and we are
only creating one. The second is that this up-
per limit is almost certainly too low. For many
of the alternations, although our table contained
different verbs, translations using identical verbs
are also acceptable. In fact, most transitive verbs
can be made passive, and most intransitive verbs
embedded in a causative construction, so this al-
ternative is always possible (and is also possible
for Japanese). However, if the Japanese uses a
lexical alternation, it is more faithful to link it to
an English lexical alternation when possible.

We use the most frequent argument in existing

section.
Although we only discuss the selectional re-
strictions and subcat information here, we also
map the verb classes (given as verbal semantic at-
tributes (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1997)). The map-
ping for the dependents in the alternation can
be taken from existing lexical resources (Dorr,
1997), learned from corpora (McCarthy, 2000) or
learned from existing lexicons (Bond et al., 2002).

4.1 Target
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998813125">
In this experiment, we look at one family of al-
ternations, the S = O alternation. The candidate
words are thus intransitive verbs with no transi-
tive alternate, or transitive entries with no in-
transitive alternate. Alternations should be be-
tween senses, but the alternation list is only of
words. Many of the candidate words (those that
have a entry for only one alternate) have sev-
eral entries. Only some of these are suitable as
seeds. We don’t use entries which are intransi-
tive lemmas but have an accusative argument,
which are intransitive (or transitive) lemmas but
have an transitive translation (or intransitive),
or which have both topic and nominative, such
as (1), where the nominative argument is incor-
porated in the English translation.

There are 115 entries (37 lemmas) which have
only intransitive entries and 81 entries (25 lem-
mas) which have only transitive entries which are
in our reference list of alternating verbs. We cre-
ate intransitive entries using the existing transi-
tive entries, and transitive entries using the ex-
isting intransitive entries.

4.2 Creating the Japanese subcat and
SRs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940066666667">
In creating the intransitive entries from the tran-
sitive entries, we map the O’s SRs onto the S’s
SRs, and change the case marker from accusative
to nominative. We delete the A argument, and
transfer any other dependents as they are.
In creating the transitive entries, we map the
intransitive S’s SRs onto the new O’s SRs, and
give it an accusative case-marker. If the in-
transitive entry has a demoted subject argument
(where the Japanese case-marker is ni and the
English preposition is by), we promote it to sub-
ject and use its SR for A. Otherwise we add a
causative argument as ergative subject (A) with
a default SR of (agent)3 and a nominative case-
marker. We show an example in Figure 3.

The English translation can be divided into
three types: S=O, passive and synthetic.
Therefore it is necessary to judge which type
is appropriate for each entry, and then cre-
ate the English. This judgement is shown
in Figure 4. To judge whether an English

We evaluated the quality of the created entries in
a translation-based regression test. We got two
example sentences using each verb from Japanese
newspapers and web pages: this gave a total of
124 test sentences. We translated the test sen-
tences using ALT-J/E, both with (with) and
without (w/out) the new entries.
Translations that were identical were marked
no change (the system translates with a sim-
ple word dictionary if it has no valency en-
try). Translations that changed were evaluated
by people fluent in both languages (two thirds
by Japanese native speakers and one third by an
English native speaker, not the authors). The
translations were randomly presented to the eval-
uators labeled by A and B. Therefore evaluators
did not know whether a translation is with or
w/out. The translations were placed into three
categories: (i) A is better than B, (ii) A and B are
equivalent in quality, and (iii) A is worse than B.
For example in (2), the evaluation was (iii). In
this case A is w/out and B is with, so the new
entry has improved the translation.

the creation of some spurious patterns. An

The second source of errors was in the selec-

the lexicographers wanted to change the SRs.
The most common change was to make the SR

The third source of errors was in the English
translation, where the lexicographers sometimes
preferred a different verb as a translation, rather
than a regular alternation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999947785714286">
To make the construction fully automatic, a test
for whether the Japanese side of the entry is ap-
propriate or not is required.
One possibility is to add a corpus based filter:
if no examples can be found that match the selec-
tional restrictions for an entry, then it should be
rejected. This could be done for each language
individually. The problem with this approach is
that many of the entries we created were for in-
frequent verbs. The average frequency in 16 years
of Japanese newspaper text was only 173, and 22
verbs never appeared, although all were familiar
to native speakers. We can, of course, use the
web to alleviate the data sparseness problem.

6.2 Improving the English Translations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998648642857143">
In this section we compare the distribution of
the different types of translations for the refer-
ence data (§ 3.1) and the entries created by our
method (§ 3.2). The breakdown is shown in Ta-
ble 4. The first three rows show entries with the
same English main verb.
One major discrepancy is in the frequency of
the control verb construction. In Vi, no origi-
nal transitive entry used control verbs. In gen-
eral, when lexicographers create an entry, they
prefer a simple entry to a synthetic one. Look-
ing at the linguists’ reference data, about 6.5%
of the examples used control verbs. In the con-
structed data, 66.1% (77 entries) use the control
verb make, more than any other category. For ex-
ample, when the original intransitive entry is N1
be exhausted, exhausted is defined as adjective in
the existing dictionary. So we create a new en-
try N1 make N2 exhaustedadj. However, there
is a transitive verb exhaust, and it was preferred
by the lexicographers: N1 exhaust N2. The al-
gorithm needs to optionally convert adjectives to
verbs in cases where there is overlap between the
adjective and past participle.
Finally, we consider those Japanese alterna-
tions where the transitive and intransitive alter-
natives need translations with different English
main verbs. A good example of this is Vi

using our method. Even with reliable English
syntactic data, it would be hard to rule out pass
away as a possible transitive verb or lose as an
intransitive. They can only be ruled out by us-
ing data linking the subcat with the meaning,
and this would need to be linked to the Japanese
verbs’ meanings. This may become possible with
larger linked multi-lingual dictionaries, such as
those under construction in the Papillon project,5
but is not now within our reach.
In summary, we could improve the construction
of the English translations by using richer English
information, especially about past-participles or
verb senses.

6.3 Usage as a Lexical/Translation Rule
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928045454545">
Although we have investigated the use of al-
ternations in lexicon construction, the algo-
rithms could also be used directly, either as lexi-
cal/translation rules or to generate transitive and
intransitive entries from a common underlying
representation. For example, Shirai et al. (1999)
uses the existing entries and lexical rules deploy-
ing them to translate causatives and passives (in-
cluding adversative passives) from Japanese to
English. Trujillo (1995) showed a method to ap-
ply lexical rules for word translation. That is,
they expand the vocabulary using prepared lex-
ical rules for each language, and create links for
translation between the lexical rules of a pair of
languages. Dorr (1997) and Baldwin et al. (1999)
generate both alternates from a single underlying
representation.
Our proposed method could partially be im-
plemented as a lexical or a translation rule. But
not all the word senses alternate (§ 4.2), and not
all the target language entries are regularly trans-
lated by the same head (§ 3). Further many of the

In this paper, we targeted native Japanese verbs
only. ALT-J/E already has a very high coverage
of native Japanese verbs. However, even in this
case, we could increase the cover of this alterna-
tion from 85% to 98% (442 out of 449 alternation
pairs now in the dictionary). Most valency dic-
tionaries or new language pairs have less cover,
and so will get more results. It is also possible
to use this method so as to only create half the
entries by hand, and then to automatically make
the alternating halves (although not all the cre-
ated entries will be perfect).
In addition to the native Japanese verbs, there
are many Sino-Japanese verbal nouns that un-
dergo S=O alternation (For example, (3) H (4)).

ALT-J/E’s Japanese dictionary has about
2,400 verbal nouns which have usage as both
transitive and intransitive. Of these only 536 are
in the valency dictionary. Our next plan is to
add them all to the valency dictionary, using al-
ternations to make the process more efficient and
consistent.
Another extension is to apply the method to
other alternations, using either linguists’ data or
automatically acquired alternations (Oishi and

The knowledge acquisition bottleneck, however, remains: precise grammars need information-rich lexicons, such as valency dictionaries, which are costly to build and extend. In this paper, we present a method of adding new entries to an existing bilingual valency dictionary, using information about verbal alternations. The classic approach to acquiring lexical information is to build resources by hand. This produces useful resources but is expensive. This is still the approach taken by large projects such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or OntoSem. Therefore, there is a need to extend these handmade resources quickly and economically. Another approach is to attempt to learn information from corpora. There has been much research based on this, but due to the inevitable errors, there are few examples of lexicons being constructed fully automatically. Korhonen (2002) reports that the ceiling on the performance of mono-lingual subcategorization acquisition from corpora is generally around 80%, a level that still requires manual intervention.

It combines two heterogeneous knowledge sources: an existing bilingual valency lexicon (the seed lexicon), and information about verbal alternations. Most verbs have more than one possible argument structure (subcat). These can be regularized into pairs of alternations, where two argument structures link similar semantic roles into different subcats. Levin (1993) has identified over 80 alternation types for English, and these have been extended to cover 4,432 verbs in 492 classes (Dorr, 1997). In this paper, we will consider alternations between transitive (Vt) and intransitive (Vi) uses of verbs, where the subject of the intransitive verb (S) is the same as the object of the transitive verb (O) (e.g. the acid dissolved the metal &lt;---&gt; the metal dissolved (in the acid)) (Levin, 1993, 26–33)). We call the subject of the transitive verb A (ergative) and this alternation the S=O alternation.

Dorr (1997), who generates both alternations from a single underlying representation, implicitly makes this assumption. In addition, Kilgarriff (1993) specifically makes the A (+sentient, +volition), while the O is (+changes-state, +causally affected). However, we know of no quantitative studies of the similarities of alternating verbs. Exploiting the machine translation lexicon for linguistic research, we compare the SRs of S with both A and O for verbs that take the S=O alternation. The SRs take the form of a list of semantic classes, strings or *. Strings only match specific words, while * matches any</context>

Specific examples of creating S = O alternations are given in the next section. Although we only discuss the selectional restrictions and subcat information here, we also map the verb classes (given as verbal semantic attributes (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1997)). The mapping for the dependents in the alternation can be taken from existing lexical resources (Dorr, 1997), learned from corpora (McCarthy, 2000) or learned from existing lexicons (Bond et al., 2002). 4.1 Target In this experiment, we look at one family of alternations, the S = O alternation. The candidate words are thus intransitive verbs with no transitive alternate, or transitive entries with no intransitive alternate. Alternations should be between senses, but the alternation list is only of words. Many of the candidate words (those that have a entry for only one alternate) have several entries. Only some of these are suitable as seeds. We don’t use entries which are intransitive lemmas but ha</context>

For example, Shirai et al. (1999) uses the existing entries and lexical rules deploying them to translate causatives and passives (including adversative passives) from Japanese to English. Trujillo (1995) showed a method to apply lexical rules for word translation. That is, they expand the vocabulary using prepared lexical rules for each language, and create links for translation between the lexical rules of a pair of languages. Dorr (1997) and Baldwin et al. (1999) generate both alternates from a single underlying representation. Our proposed method could partially be implemented as a lexical or a translation rule. But not all the word senses alternate (§ 4.2), and not all the target language entries are regularly translated by the same head (§ 3). Further many of the 4My friend passed away +-+ I lost my friend. 5http://www.papillon-dictionary.org/ rules mix lexical and syntactic information, making them quite complicated.

(3) (4) ALT-J/E’s Japanese dictionary has about 2,400 verbal nouns which have usage as both transitive and intransitive. Of these only 536 are in the valency dictionary. Our next plan is to add them all to the valency dictionary, using alternations to make the process more efficient and consistent.

This data supports the hypothesis in Kilgarriff (1993). 2There is some variation due to lexicographer’s inconsistencies.

We propose a method of acquiring detailed information about predicates, including argument structure, semantic restrictions on the arguments and translation equivalents. It combines two heterogeneous knowledge sources: an existing bilingual valency lexicon (the seed lexicon), and information about verbal alternations. Most verbs have more than one possible argument structure (subcat). These can be regularized into pairs of alternations, where two argument structures link similar semantic roles into different subcats. Levin (1993) has identified over 80 alternation types for English, and these have been extended to cover 4,432 verbs in 492 classes (Dorr, 1997).

In addition to the native Japanese verbs, there are many Sino-Japanese verbal nouns that undergo S=O alternation (For example, (3) H (4)). (3) (4) ALT-J/E’s Japanese dictionary has about 2,400 verbal nouns which have usage as both transitive and intransitive. Of these only 536 are in the valency dictionary. Our next plan is to add them all to the valency dictionary, using alternations to make the process more efficient and consistent. Another extension is to apply the method to other alternations, using either linguists’ data or automatically acquired alternations (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1997; Furumaki and Tanaka, 2003; seihin o products ACC kanbai-shita sold out The shop sold out of the products. seihin ga kanbai-shita products NOM sold out The products are sold out. ga NOM mise shop McCarthy, 2000). In particular, S = O alternations make up only 34% of those discovered by Bond et al. (2002), we intend to investigate the alternations that make up the remainder. 7 Conclusion We presented a method that uses alternation data to add new entries to an existing translation lexicon. The new entries have detailed information about argument structure and selectional restrictions. We were </context>

The new entries have detailed information about argument structure and selectional restrictions. In this paper we focus on one class of alternations, but our method is applicable to any alternation. We were able to increase the coverage of the causative alternation to 98%, and the new entries gave an overall improvement in translation quality of 32%. 1 Introduction Recently, deep linguistic processing, which aims to provide a useful semantic representation, has become the focus of more research, as parsing technologies improve in both speed and robustness (Uszkoreit, 2002). In particular, machine translation systems still mainly rely on large hand-crafted lexicons. The knowledge acquisition bottleneck, however, remains: precise grammars need information-rich lexicons, such as valency dictionaries, which are costly to build and extend. In this paper, we present a method of adding new entries to an existing bilingual valency dictionary, using information about verbal alternations. The classic approach to acquiring lexical information is to build resources by hand. This produces useful resources but is expensive. This is still the approach taken by large projects </context>
