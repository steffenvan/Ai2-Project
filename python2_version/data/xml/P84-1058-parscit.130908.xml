ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9738834">
A lexicon-grammar is constituted of the elementary sentences of
a language. Instead of considering words as basic syntactic units
to which grammatical information is attached, we use simple
sentences (subject-verb-objects) as dictionary entries. Hence, a
full dictionary item is a simple sentence with a description of the
corresponding distributional and transformational properties.
The systematic study of French has led to an organization of
its lexicon-grammar based on three main components:
- the lexicon-grammar of free sentences, that is, of sentences whose
verb imposes selectional restrictions on its subject and complements
(e.g. to tall, to eat, to watch),
- the lexicon-grammar of frozen or idiomatic expressions (e.g.
N takes N into account. N raises a question,
- the lexicon-grammar of support verbs. These verbs do not have the
common selectional restrictions, but more complex dependencies
between subject and complement (e.g. to have, to make in
N has an impact on N, N makes a certain impression on N)
These three components interact in specific ways. We present
the structure of the lexicon-grammar built for French and we discuss
its algorithmic implications for parsing.
The construction of a lexicon-grammar of French has led to an
accumulation of linguistic information that should significantly
bear on the procedures of automatic analysis of natural languages.
We shall present the structure of a lexicon-grammar built for French
&lt;2) and will discuss its algorithmic main implications.

1. VERBS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.915055888888889">
The syntactic properties of French verbs have been limited in
terms of the size of sentences, that is, by restricting the type of
complements to object complements. We considered 3 main types of
objects: direct, and with prepositions a and de. Verbs have
been selected from current dictionaries according to the
reproducibility of the syntactic judgments carried out on them by a
team of linguists. A set of about 10,000 verbs has thus been
studied.
The properties systematically studied for each verb are the
standard ones:
1 E.R.A. 247 of the C.N.R.S. afiliated to the Universities Paris
7 and Paris VIII.
2 Publication of the lexicon-grammar is under way. The main
segments available are: Boons, Guillet, Leclere 1976a, 1976b and
Gross 1975 for French verbs, Giry-Schneider 1978, A Meunier 1981,
de NiSgroni 1978, for nominalizations.
- distributional properties, such as human or non human nouns, and
their pronominal shapes (definite, relative, interrogative pronouns
&lt;3), clitics), possibility of sentential subjects and complements
que $ (that S), si S (whether S, it S) or reduced infinitive
forms noted V Comp,
- transformational properties, such as passive, extraposition,
cliticization, etc.
Altogether, 500 properties have been checked against the 10,000
verbs &lt;4).
More precisely, each property can be viewed as a sentence form.
Consider for example the transitive structure
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.731185">
(1) No V N1
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9717245">
We are using Z.S. Harris&apos; notation for sentence structure: noun
phrases are indexed by numerical subscripts, starting with the
subject indexed by 0. We can note the property &amp;quot;human subject&amp;quot; in
the following equivalent ways:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.490255">
(2) Nhum V N1 or No Nhum) V N1
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998983">
where the symbol x: is used to specify a structure . A passive
structure will be noted
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.648504">
(3) NI be V-ed by No
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.618645">
A transformation is a relation between two structures noted
(1) = (3) corresponds to the Passive rule
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995084">
The syntactic information attached to simple sentences can thus be
represented in a uniform way by means of binary matrix (Table 1).
Each row of the matrix corresponds to a verb, each column to a
sentence form. When a verb enters into a sentence form, a &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; sign
is placed at the intersection of the corresponding row and column,
if not a &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; sign. The description of the French verbs does not
have the shape of a 10,000x500 matrix. Because of its redundancy
(cf. note 4 ), the matrix has been broken down into about 50
submatrices whose size is 200x40 on the average. It is such a
system of submatrices that we call a lexicon-grammar.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.593226666666667">
3 Actually, the shape of interrogative pronouns: qui (who),
qua-quo! (what) has been used to define a formal notion of
object.
4 Not all properties are relevant to each of the 14000 verbs.
For example, the properties of chilies associated to object
complements are irrelevant to intransitive verbs.

described as the basic ones by traditional grammarians, the

As can be seen on table 2, direct oblects are the most numerous in

<bodyText confidence="0.981237416666667">
the lexicon. Also, we have not observed a single example of verbs
with 3 objects according to our definition.
In 2. and 3. we will make more precise the lexical nature of
the N,&apos;s attached to the verbs.
The signs in a row of the matrix provides the syntactic
paradigm of a verb, that is, the sentence forms into which the verb
may enter. The lexicon-grammar is in computer form. Thus, by
sorting the rows of signs, one can construct equivalence classes for
verbs: Two verbs are in the same class if their two rows of signs
are identical.
We have obtained the following result: for 10,000 verbs there
are about 8,000 classes.
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.742133727272727">
On the average, each class contains 1.25 verb. This
statistical result can easily be strengthened. When one studies the
classes that contain more than one verb, it is always possible to
find syntactic properties not yet in the matrix and that will
separate the verbs. Hence, it our description were extended, each
verb would have a unique syntactic paradigm.
Thus, the correspondence between a verb morpheme and the set of
sentence forms where it may occur is one-to-one.
Another way of stating this result is by saying that structures
depend on individual lexical elements, which leads to the following
representation of structures:
</tableCaption>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.786476">
No eat N1
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973319153846154">
No we Ni to N2
We still use class symbols to describe noun phrases, but specific
verbs must appear in each structure. Class symbols of verbs are no
longer used, since they cannot determine the syntactic behaviour of
individual verbs.
The nature of the lexicon-grammar should then become clearer. An
entry of the lexicon-grammar of verbs is a simple sentence form with
an explicit verb appearing in a row. In general, the declarative
sentence is taken as the representative element of the equivalence
class of structures corresponding to the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; signs of a row.
The lexicon-grammar suggests a new component for parsing
algorithms. This component is limited to elementary sentences. It
includes the following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989242142857143">
- (A) Verbs are morphologically recognized in the input string.
- (B) The dictionary is looked up, that is, the space of the
lexicon-grammar that contains the verbs is searched for the input
verbs.
- (C) A verb being located in the matrix, its rows of signs provide
a set of sentence forms. These dictionary forms are matched with
the input string.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.807428">
This algorithm is incomplete in several respects:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884666666667">
- In step (C), matching one of the dictionary shapes with the input
string may involve another component of the grammar. The structures
represented in the lexicon-grammar are elementary structures,
subject only to &amp;quot;unary&amp;quot; transformations, in the sense of Harris&apos;
transformations or of early generative grammar (Chomsky 1955).
Binary or generalized transformations apply to elementary sentences
and may change their appearance in the sentence under analysis (e.g.
con function reduction). As a consequence, their effect may have to
be taken into account in the matching process.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.987438">
276
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987645">
- Looking up the matrix dictionary may result in the finding of
several entries with same form (homographs) or of several uses of a
given entry. We will see that these situations are quite common.
In general, more than one pattern may match the input, multiple
paths of analysis are thus generated and require book keeping.
We will come back to these aspects of syntactic computation.
We now present two other components of the lexicon-grammar of simple
sentences.

2. IDIOMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982135170212766">
The sentences we just described can be called free sentences,
for the lexical choices of nouns in each noun phrase Ni has
certain degrees of freedom. We use this distributional feature to
separate free from frozen sentences, that is, from sentences with an
idiomatic part.
The main difference between free and frozen sentences can be
stated in terms of the distributions of nouns:
- in a frozen nominal position, a change of noun either changes the
meaning of the expression to an unrelated expression as in
to /ay down one&apos;s arms vs to lay down one&apos;s feet
or else, the variant noun does not introduce any difference in
meaning (up to stylistic differences), as in
to put someone off the (scent, track, trail)
or else, an idiomatic noun appears at the same level as ordinary
nouns of the distribution, and the general meaning of the (free)
expression is preserved, as in
to miss (an opportunity, the bus)
- in a free position, a change of noun introduces a change of
meaning that does not affect the general meaning of the whole
sentence. For example, the two sentences
The boy ate the apple
My sister ate the pie
that differ by distributional changes in subiect and object
positions have same general meaning; changes can be considered to
be localized to the arguments of the predicate or function with
constant meaning EAT.
We have systematically described the idiomatic sentences of
French, making use of the framework developed for the tree
sentences. Sentential idioms have been classified according to the
nature (frozen or not) of their arguments (subject and complements).
With respect to the structures of Table 2, a new classificatory
feature has been introduced: the possibility for a frozen noun or
noun phrase to accept a free noun complement. Thus, for example, we
built two classes CP1 and CPN corresponding to the two types of
constructions
No V Prep C1 a: Jo plays on words
No V Prep Nhum&apos;s C1 =: Jo got on Bob&apos;s nerves
The symbol C refers to a frozen nominal position and Prep
stands for preposition.
Although frozen structures tend to undergo less transformations
than the free forms, we found that every transformation that applies
to a tree structure also applies to some frozen structures. There
is no qualitative difference between free and frozen structures from
the syntactic point of view. As a consequence, we can use the same
type of representation: a matrix where each idiomatic combination
of words appears in a row and each sentence shape in a column (cf.
Tables 3 and O.

<bodyText confidence="0.8698426875">
We have systematically classified 115.000 idiomatic sentences. When
one compares this figure with those of table /, one must conclude
that frozen sentences constitute one of the most important
components of the lexicon-grammar.
An important lexical feature of frozen sentences should be
stressed. There are examples such as
They went astray
where words such as astray cannot be found in any other
syntactically unrelated sentence; notice that the causative sentence
This led them astray
is considered as syntactically related. In this case, the
expression can be direcly recognized by dictionary look-up. But
such examples are rare. In general, a frozen expression is a
compound of words that are also used in free expressions with
unrelated meanings. Hence, frozen sentences are in general
ambiguous, having an idiomatic meaning and a literal meaning.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.983845">
277
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99869">
However, the literal meanings are almost always incongruous in the
context where the idiomatic meaning is intended (unless of course
Ire author of the utterance played on words). Thus, when a word
combination that constitutes an idiom is encountered in a text, one
is practically ensured that the corresponding meaning is the
idiomatic one.

Frozen sentences

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.982953225806452">
Returning to the algorithm sketched in 1., we see that we have
to modify steps (A) and (8) in order to recognize frozen
expressions:
- Not only verbs, but nouns have to be immediately located in the
input String.
- The verbs and the nouns columns of the lexicon-grammar of frozen
expressions have to be looked up for combinations of words.
It is interesting to note that there is no ground for stating a
priority such as look up verbs before nouns or the reverse. Rather,
the nature of frozen forms suggests simultaneous searches for the
composing words.
About the difference between free and frozen sentences, we have
observed that Many free sentences (if not all) have highly
restricted nominal positions. Consider for example the entry
No smoke N1 in
Jo smokes the finest tobacco
In the direct object complement, one will find few other nouns:
nouns of other smoking material, objects made of smoking material
such as cigarette, cigar, pipe and brand names for
these objects. This is a common situation with technical verbs.
Such examples suggest that, semantically at least, the nominal
arguments are limited to one noun, which comes close to having the
status of frozen expression. Thus, to smoke would have here
one complement, perhaps tobacco, and all other nouns occurring
in its place would be brought in by syntactic operations. We
consider that this situation is quite general although not always
transparent. Our analysts of free elementary sentences has shown
that when subjects and objects allow wide variations for their
nouns, then well defined syntactic operations account for the
variation:
- separation of entries: For example, there is another verb
No smoke NI, as in They smoke meat, and a third one:
No smoke N1 out in They smoked the room out; or
consider the verb to eat in
Rual ale both rear wings of my car
This verb will constitute an entry different of the one in to eat
lamb;
- various zeroings: The following sentence pairs will be related
by different deletions:
Bob ate a nice preparation
= Bob ate a nice preparation of lamb
Bob ale a whole bakery
= Bob ate a whole bakery of apple pies
Other operations introduce nouns in syntactic positions where
they are foreign to the semantic distributions, among them are
- raising operations, which induce distributional differences such
as
I imagined the situation
I imagined the bridge destroyed
situation is the &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; direct object of to imagine,
while bridge is derived:
- other restructuration operations (Guillet. Lecldre 1981), as
between the two sentences
This confirmed Bob&apos;s opinion of Jo
This confirmed Bob in his opinion of Jo
Although the full lexicon of French has not yet been analyzed
from this point of view, we can plausibly assert that a large class
of nominal distributions could be made semantically regular by using
Z.G. Harris&apos; account of elementary distributions, namely, by
- determining a basic form for each meaning, for example
A person eats food
with undetermined human subject and characteristic object, and by
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991996">
278
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.5673745">
- introducing classificatory sentences that describe the semantic
universe:
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.46553">
(The boy, My sister) is a person, etc.
(A pie, This cake) is food, etc.
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.3357725">
Classificatory and basic sentences are combined by syntactic
operations such as
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.33697" genericHeader="method">
- relativization:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9678915">
The person who is the boy eats food which is this pie
- WH-is deletion:
The person the boy eats food this pie
- redundancy removal:
The boy eats this pie
In this way, the semantic variations are explicitly attributed
to lexical variations, and not to intuitive abstract features, that
is, arbitrary features, or semes or the like. The requirement of
using WORDS in such descriptions is a crucial means for controlling
the construction of an empirically adequate linguistic system. In
this respect, one is led to categorizing words by evaluating actual
classificatory sentences. Hence, all the knowledge linguistically
expressible (i.e. in terms of words) is represented by both the
basic and the classificatory sentences. A good deal of the
inferences that one has to draw in order to understand sentences are
contained in the derivations that lead to the seemingly simple
sentences.
From a formal point of view, the entries of the lexicon-grammar
become much more specific. We have eliminated class symbols
altogether, replacing them by specific nouns &lt;5&gt;. Entries are then
of the type
(person),&amp;quot; eat (food)1
(person)0 give (object)1 to (person)2
(person)3 kick the bucket
An application of this representation of simple sentences is the
treatment of certain metaphors. Consider the two sentences
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997856">
(1) Jo filled the turkey with truffles
(2) Jo filled his report with poor jokes
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.924697428571429">
(1) is a proper use of to fill, while (2) is a metaphoric or
figurative meaning. The properties of these sentences vary
according to the lexical choices in the complements (Boons 1971).
For example, the with-complement that can be occupied by an
internal noun in the proper meaning can be omitted:
Jo filled the turkey with a certain filling
Jo filled the turkey
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.819399" genericHeader="method">
5 It is doubtful that actual nouns such as food will be
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99471625">
available in the language for each distribution of each entry, but
then, expressions such as smoking stuff can be used (in the
object of to smoke), again avoiding the use of abstract
features.
&apos;This is not the case in the figurative meaning:
*Jo filled his report
How to represent (1) and (2) is a problem in terms of number of
entries. On the one hand, the two constructions have common
syntactic and semantic features, on the other, they are
significantly different in form and content. Setting up two entries
is a solution, but not a satisfactory one, since both entries are
left unrelated. A possible solution in the framework of
lexicon-grammars is to consider having just one entry:
No fill N1 with N2
and to specify N1 lexically by means of columns of the matrix.
For example
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.2881485">
N1 food
N1 r: text
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994415">
Then, the content of N2 is largely determined and has to be
roughly of the type
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9245255">
N2 =: stuffing
N2 r: subtext
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996701">
An inclusion relation &lt;6&gt; holds between the two complements. We can
write for this relation
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.842916">
N2 is in N1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838">
But now, in our parsing procedure, we have to compensate for
the fact that in the lexicon-grammar, the nouns that are represented
In the free positions are not the ones that in general occur in the
input sentences. In consequence, occurrences of nouns will have to
undergo a complex process of identification that will determine
whether they have been introduced by syntactic operations (e.g.
restructuration), or by chains of substitutions defined by
classificatory sentences, or by both processes.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.9526" genericHeader="method">
3. SUPPORT AND OPERATOR VERBS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997676">
We have alluded to the fact that only a certain class of
sentences could be reduced to entries of the lexicon-grammar as
presented in 1. and 2 We will now give examples of simple
sentences that have structures different of the structures of free
and frozen sentences. In sentences such as
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999704333333333">
(1) Her remarks made no difference
(2) Her remarks have some (importance for, influence) on Jo
(3) Her remarks are in contradiction with your plan
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.934880111111111">
it is difficult to argue that the verbs to make, to have
and to be in semantically select their subjects and
complements. Rather, these verbs should be considered as
auxiliaries. The predicative element is here the nominal form in
complement position. This intuition can be given a formal basis.
Let us look at nominalizations as being relations between two simple

Max walked Two problems arise in connection with the distribution of support
verbs:
= Max look a walk
- a noun or a nominalized verb accepts a certain set of support
verbs and this set varies with each nominal;
Her remarks are important for Jo - not every verb is a support verb; thus in the sentence

from other verbs is the possibility of clefting noun complements.
= Jo (bears, carries) a certain resemblance with Max For example, for Jo is a noun complement of the same type in
both structures, but we observe
= There is a certain resemblance between Jo and Max
*It is for Jo that Max described Bob&apos;s love
It is then clear that the roots walk, important and

found in more complex sentences such as
Bob loves Jo

= Bob fell in love with Jo
= Bob has a deep love for Jo
to fall, as other motion verbs do, introduces an inchoative
meaning. In this example, the main semantic relation holds between
Bob and love, and the support verbs simply add their
meaning to the relation.

The verbs to put and to give are semantically minimal, for
they only introduce a causative and/or an agentive argument with
respect to the sentence with Vsup. We call such verbs operator
verbs (Vop). There are other operator verbs that add various
modalities to the minimal meanings, as in
The note introduced a contradiction between her remarks
and your plan
Bob attributed a certain importance to her remarks
Other syntactic shapes are found:
Bob credited her remarks with a certain importance
Again, the set of nouns (supported by a Vsup) to which the
Vops apply vary from verb to verb. As a consequence, we have to
represent the distributions of Vsups and Vops with respect to
nominals by means of a matrix such as the one in Table 4.
In each row, we place a noun and each column contains a support verb
or an operator verb. A preliminary classification of Ns (and
V-ns) has been made in terms of a few elementary support verbs
(e.g. to have, to be Prep).
In a sense, this representation is symmetrical with the
representation of free sentences. With free sentences, the verb is
taken as the central item of the sentence. Varying then the nouns
allowed with the verb does not change fundamentally the meaning of
the corresponding sentences. With support verbs, the central item
is a noun. Varying then the support verbs only introduces a
distributional-like change in meaning.
The recognition procedure has to be modified, in order to
account for this component of the language:
- first, the look-up procedure must determine whether a verb is an
ordinary verb (i.e. an entry found in a row of the lexicon-grammar)
or a Vaup or a Vop, which are to be found in columns:
- simultaneously, nouns have to be looked up in order to check
their combination with support verbs.

4. CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.959422746031746">
We have shown that simple sentence structures were of varied
types. At the same time, we have seen that their representation in
terms of the entries of traditional &amp;quot;linear&amp;quot; dictionaries, that is,
in terms of words alphabetically or otherwise ordered, is
inadequate. An improvement appears to involve the look-up of
two-dimensional patterns, for example the matrices we proposed for
frozen sentences and their generalization to support verbs and
operator verbs. More generally, syntactic structures are determined
by combinations of a verb morpheme with one or more noun
morpheme(s). Hence, the general way to access the lexicon will have
to be through the selections, matrix of Tables 3 and 4,
In practice, syntactic computations are context-free
computations in natural language processing. Context-free
algorithms have been studied in many respects by computer
scientists, theoreticians and specialists of programming languages.
The principles of these algorithms are clearly understood and
currently in use, even for natural languages where new problems
arise because of the numerous ambiguities and the various
terminologies attached to each theoretical viewpoint.
•
The fact that context-tree recognition is a mastered technique
has certainly contributed to the shaping of the grammars used in
automatic parsing. The numerous sample grammars presented so far
are practically all context-tree. There is also a deep linguistic
reason for building context-free grammars: natural languages use
embedding processes and tend to avoid discontinuous structures.
Much less attention has been paid to the complex syntactic
phenomena occurring in simple sentences and to the organization of
the lexicon. The fact that we could not separate the syntactic
properties of verbs from their lexical features has led us to
construct a representation for linguistic phenomena which is more
specific than the current context-tree models. A context-free
component will still be useful in the parsing process, but it will
be relevant only to embedded structures found in complex sentences,
with not much incidence on meaning.
To summarize, the syntactic patterns are determined by pairs
(verb, noun):
- the frozen sentence No kick the bucket is thus entirely
specified, while the pair (lake, bull) needs to be
disambiguated by the second complement by the horns, requiring
thus a more complex device to be identified;
- (take, walk) and (take, food) are support
sentences, so are (have, faith) and (have, food);
- the verbs have, kick and take together with
concrete object select ordinary sentence forms.
But the selectional process for structures may not be direct.
The words in the previously discussed pairs may not appear in the
input text. Words appearing in the input are then related to the
words in the selectional matrix by:
- classificational relations:
food classifies cake, soup, etc.
concrete object classifies ball, chair, etc.
- relations between support sentences, such as
Jo (had, fookthrew out) some food
Jo (took, was out for. went out for) a walk
Jo (has, keeps, looses) faith in Bob
- relations between support and operator sentences:
This gave to Jo faith in Bob
All these relations on fact add a third dimension to the
selectional matrix.
The complete selectional device is now a complex network of
relations that cross-relates the entries. It will have to be
organized in order to optimize the speed of parsing algorithms.

<abstract confidence="0.990462152542373">A lexicon-grammar is constituted of the elementary sentences of a language. Instead of considering words as basic syntactic units to which grammatical information is attached, we use simple sentences (subject-verb-objects) as dictionary entries. Hence, a item is a simple sentence with a description of the corresponding distributional and transformational properties. The systematic study of French has led to an organization of its lexicon-grammar based on three main components: the lexicon-grammar of that is, of sentences whose verb imposes selectional restrictions on its subject and complements tall, to eat, to watch), the lexicon-grammar of frozen or idiomatic expressions (e.g. N takes N into account. N raises a question, the lexicon-grammar of support verbs. These verbs do not have the common selectional restrictions, but more complex dependencies subject and complement (e.g. have, to make in N has an impact on N, N makes a certain impression on N) These three components interact in specific ways. We present the structure of the lexicon-grammar built for French and we discuss its algorithmic implications for parsing. The construction of a lexicon-grammar of French has led to an of linguistic information significantly bear on the procedures of automatic analysis of natural languages. the structure of a lexicon-grammar built for French will discuss its algorithmic main implications. syntactic properties of French verbs have in terms of the size of sentences, that is, by restricting the type of complements to object complements. We considered 3 main types of direct, and with prepositions de. Verbs have selected from according to the reproducibility of the syntactic judgments carried out on them by a team of linguists. A set of about 10,000 verbs has thus been studied. The properties systematically studied for each verb are the standard ones: 247 of the C.N.R.S. afiliated to the Universities Paris 7 and Paris VIII. 2 Publication of the lexicon-grammar is under way. The main segments available are: Boons, Guillet, Leclere 1976a, 1976b and Gross 1975 for French verbs, Giry-Schneider 1978, A Meunier 1981, de NiSgroni 1978, for nominalizations. distributional properties, such as human or non human nouns, and their pronominal shapes (definite, relative, interrogative pronouns &lt;3), clitics), possibility of sentential subjects and complements $ S), S S, it S) or reduced infinitive noted Comp, transformational properties, such as passive, extraposition, cliticization, etc. Altogether, 500 properties have been checked against the 10,000 verbs &lt;4). More precisely, each property can be viewed as a sentence form. Consider for example the transitive structure No We are using Z.S. Harris&apos; notation for sentence structure: noun phrases are indexed by numerical subscripts, starting with the subject indexed by 0. We can note the property &amp;quot;human subject&amp;quot; in the following equivalent ways: Nhum V N1 No V N1 where the symbol x: is used to specify a structure . A passive structure will be noted NI V-ed by No A transformation is a relation between two structures noted (1) = (3) corresponds to the Passive rule The syntactic information attached to simple sentences can thus be represented in a uniform way by means of binary matrix (Table 1). row of the matrix corresponds to a verb, to a sentence form. When a verb enters into a sentence form, a &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; sign is placed at the intersection of the corresponding row and column, if not a &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; sign. The description of the French verbs does not have the shape of a 10,000x500 matrix. Because of its redundancy note ), matrix has been broken down into about 50 submatrices whose size is 200x40 on the average. It is such a system of submatrices that we call a lexicon-grammar. Actually, the shape of interrogative pronouns: has been used to define a formal notion of object. 4 Not all properties are relevant to each of the 14000 verbs. For example, the properties of chilies associated to object complements are irrelevant to intransitive verbs. 275 I ZZZ1Z &gt; lE N PA » &gt;1 — 4ZiZd.•;Z IINSIIIII i € eZZZiZi a g ...= E € , - &gt; &gt; - Z5 4 .. 1L2 ...

<abstract confidence="0.993752765765766">Table 2 As can be seen on table 2, direct oblects are the most numerous in the lexicon. Also, we have not observed a single example of verbs with 3 objects according to our definition. In 2. and 3. we will make more precise the lexical nature of the N,&apos;s attached to the verbs. The signs in a row of the matrix provides the syntactic paradigm of a verb, that is, the sentence forms into which the verb enter. The lexicon-grammar is in computer form. sorting the rows of signs, one can construct equivalence classes for verbs: Two verbs are in the same class if their two rows of signs are identical. the following result: for 10,000 verbs 8,000 classes. On the average, each class contains 1.25 verb. This statistical result can easily be strengthened. When one studies the classes that contain more than one verb, it is always possible to find syntactic properties not yet in the matrix and that will separate the verbs. Hence, it our description were extended, each verb would have a unique syntactic paradigm. Thus, the correspondence between a verb morpheme and the set of sentence forms where it may occur is one-to-one. Another way of stating this result is by saying that structures depend on individual lexical elements, which leads to the following representation of structures: N1 No we Ni to N2 use class symbols to describe noun phrases, but specific verbs must appear in each structure. Class symbols of verbs are no longer used, since they cannot determine the syntactic behaviour of individual verbs. The nature of the lexicon-grammar should then become clearer. An entry of the lexicon-grammar of verbs is a simple sentence form with explicit verb appearing in a row. In general, sentence is taken as the representative element of the equivalence class of structures corresponding to the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; signs of a row. The lexicon-grammar suggests a new component for parsing algorithms. This component is limited to elementary sentences. It includes the following steps: - (A) Verbs are morphologically recognized in the input string. - (B) The dictionary is looked up, that is, the space of the lexicon-grammar that contains the verbs is searched for the input verbs. - (C) A verb being located in the matrix, its rows of signs provide a set of sentence forms. These dictionary forms are matched with the input string. This algorithm is incomplete in several respects: - In step (C), matching one of the dictionary shapes with the input string may involve another component of the grammar. The structures represented in the lexicon-grammar are elementary structures, subject only to &amp;quot;unary&amp;quot; transformations, in the sense of Harris&apos; transformations or of early generative grammar (Chomsky 1955). Binary or generalized transformations apply to elementary sentences and may change their appearance in the sentence under analysis (e.g. con function reduction). As a consequence, their effect may have to be taken into account in the matching process. 276 - Looking up the matrix dictionary may result in the finding of several entries with same form (homographs) or of several uses of a given entry. We will see that these situations are quite common. In general, more than one pattern may match the input, multiple paths of analysis are thus generated and require book keeping. We will come back to these aspects of syntactic computation. We now present two other components of the lexicon-grammar of simple sentences. sentences we can free sentences, for the lexical choices of nouns in each noun phrase Ni has certain degrees of freedom. We use this distributional feature to separate free from frozen sentences, that is, from sentences with an idiomatic part. The main difference between free and frozen sentences can be stated in terms of the distributions of nouns: in a frozen nominal position, a change of noun either changes the meaning of the expression to an unrelated expression as in /ay down one&apos;s arms lay down one&apos;s feet else, the does not introduce any difference in meaning (up to stylistic differences), as in to put someone off the (scent, track, trail) or else, an idiomatic noun appears at the same level as ordinary nouns of the distribution, and the general meaning of the (free) expression is preserved, as in to miss (an opportunity, the bus) in a free position, a change of noun introduces a change of meaning that does not affect the general meaning of the whole sentence. For example, the two sentences The boy ate the apple My sister ate the pie that differ by distributional changes in subiect and object positions have same general meaning; changes can be considered to be localized to the arguments of the predicate or function with constant meaning EAT. We have systematically described the idiomatic sentences of making use of the framework developed for the sentences. Sentential idioms have been classified according to the nature (frozen or not) of their arguments (subject and complements). With respect to the structures of Table 2, a new classificatory feature has been introduced: the possibility for a frozen noun or noun phrase to accept a free noun complement. Thus, for example, we built two classes CP1 and CPN corresponding to the two types of constructions V C1 a: plays on words V Prep Nhum&apos;s =: got on Bob&apos;s nerves symbol C refers to a frozen nominal position and stands for preposition. frozen structures tend to undergo than the free forms, we found that every transformation that applies to a tree structure also applies to some frozen structures. There no qualitative free and frozen structures from syntactic point of view. As a consequence, we can same type of representation: a matrix where each idiomatic combination of words appears in a row and each sentence shape in a column (cf.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.966930666666667">Table 3 We have systematically classified 115.000 idiomatic sentences. When one compares this figure with those of table /, one must conclude that frozen sentences constitute one of the most important components of the lexicon-grammar. important lexical feature of frozen sentences should stressed. There are examples such as They went astray words such as be found in any other syntactically unrelated sentence; notice that the causative sentence This led them astray considered related. In this case, the expression can be direcly recognized by dictionary look-up. But such examples are rare. In general, a frozen expression is a compound of words that are also used in free expressions with unrelated meanings. Hence, frozen sentences are in general ambiguous, having an idiomatic meaning and a literal meaning. 277 However, the literal meanings are almost always incongruous in the context where the idiomatic meaning is intended (unless of course Ire author of the utterance played on words). Thus, when a word combination that constitutes an idiom is encountered in a text, one practically the corresponding meaning is the idiomatic one. N I 1 &apos;I . .</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.990415150837988">Table 4 the algorithm sketched in 1., we see that we have to modify steps (A) and (8) in order to recognize frozen expressions: - Not only verbs, but nouns have to be immediately located in the - The verbs and the nouns columns of the lexicon-grammar of frozen expressions have to be looked up for combinations of words. It is interesting to note that there is no ground for stating a priority such as look up verbs before nouns or the reverse. Rather, the nature of frozen forms suggests simultaneous searches for the composing words. About the difference between free and frozen sentences, we have that sentences (if not all) have highly restricted nominal positions. Consider for example the entry N1 Jo smokes the finest tobacco In the direct object complement, one will find few other nouns: nouns of other smoking material, objects made of smoking material as cigar, pipe brand names for these objects. This is a common situation with technical verbs. Such examples suggest that, semantically at least, the nominal arguments are limited to one noun, which comes close to having the of frozen expression. Thus, smoke have here complement, perhaps all other nouns occurring in its place would be brought in by syntactic operations. We consider that this situation is quite general although not always transparent. Our analysts of free elementary sentences has shown that when subjects and objects allow wide variations for their nouns, then well defined syntactic operations account for the variation: separation of entries: For example, there is another verb smoke as in smoke meat, a third one: smoke N1 out smoked the room out; the verb eat Rual ale both rear wings of my car verb will constitute different of the one in eat lamb; various zeroings: The following sentence pairs will be related by different deletions: Bob ate a nice preparation = Bob ate a nice preparation of lamb Bob ale a whole bakery = Bob ate a whole bakery of apple pies Other operations introduce nouns in syntactic positions where they are foreign to the semantic distributions, among them are raising operations, which induce distributional differences such as I imagined the situation I imagined the bridge destroyed the &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; direct object of imagine, other restructuration operations (Guillet. Lecldre 1981), as between the two sentences This confirmed Bob&apos;s opinion of Jo This confirmed Bob in his opinion of Jo Although the full lexicon of French has not yet been analyzed from this point of view, we can plausibly assert that a large class of nominal distributions could be made semantically regular by using Z.G. Harris&apos; account of elementary distributions, namely, by determining a basic for meaning, for example A person eats food with undetermined human subject and characteristic object, and by 278 introducing classificatory sentences that describe the semantic universe: (The boy, My sister) is a person, etc. (A pie, This cake) is food, etc. Classificatory and basic sentences are combined by syntactic operations such as relativization: The person who is the boy eats food which is this pie WH-is The person the boy eats food this pie redundancy removal: The boy eats this pie In this way, the semantic variations are explicitly attributed to lexical variations, and not to intuitive abstract features, that is, arbitrary features, or semes or the like. The requirement of using WORDS in such descriptions is a crucial means for controlling the construction of an empirically adequate linguistic system. In this respect, one is led to categorizing words by evaluating actual classificatory sentences. Hence, all the knowledge linguistically expressible (i.e. in terms of words) is represented by both the basic and the classificatory sentences. A good deal of the inferences that one has to draw in order to understand sentences are contained in the derivations that lead to the seemingly simple sentences. From a formal point of view, the entries of the lexicon-grammar become much more specific. We have eliminated class symbols altogether, replacing them by specific nouns &lt;5&gt;. Entries are then of the type (person),&amp;quot; eat (food)1 (person)0 give (object)1 to (person)2 (person)3 kick the bucket An application of this representation of simple sentences is the treatment of certain metaphors. Consider the two sentences (1) Jo filled the turkey with truffles (2) Jo filled his report with poor jokes is a proper use of to (2) is a metaphoric or figurative meaning. The properties of these sentences vary according to the lexical choices in the complements (Boons 1971). For example, the with-complement that can be occupied by an internal noun in the proper meaning can be omitted: Jo filled the turkey with a certain filling Jo filled the turkey It is doubtful that actual nouns such as be available in the language for each distribution of each entry, but expressions such as stuff be used (in the of smoke), avoiding the use of abstract features. is not in the figurative meaning: *Jo filled his report How to represent (1) and (2) is a problem in terms of number of entries. On the one hand, the two constructions have common syntactic and semantic features, on the other, they are significantly different in form and content. Setting up two entries is a solution, but not a satisfactory one, since both entries are left unrelated. A possible solution in the framework of lexicon-grammars is to consider having just one entry: No fill N1 with N2 and to specify N1 lexically by means of columns of the matrix. For example N1 r: text Then, the content of N2 is largely determined and has to be roughly of the type =: N2 r: subtext An inclusion relation &lt;6&gt; holds between the two complements. We can write for this relation in N1 But now, in our parsing procedure, we have to compensate for the fact that in the lexicon-grammar, the nouns that are represented In the free positions are not the ones that in general occur in the input sentences. In consequence, occurrences of nouns will have to undergo a complex process of identification that will determine whether they have been introduced by syntactic operations (e.g. restructuration), or by chains of substitutions defined by classificatory sentences, or by both processes. 3. SUPPORT AND OPERATOR VERBS We have alluded to the fact that only a certain class of sentences could be reduced to entries of the lexicon-grammar as presented in 1. and 2 We will now give examples of simple sentences that have structures different of the structures of free and frozen sentences. In sentences such as (1) Her remarks made no difference (2) Her remarks have some (importance for, influence) on Jo (3) Her remarks are in contradiction with your plan is difficult to argue that the verbs make, to have select their subjects and complements. Rather, these verbs should be considered as auxiliaries. The predicative element is here the nominal form in complement position. This intuition can be given a formal basis. Let us look at nominalizations as being relations between two simple sentences (Z.S. Harris 1964), as in This relation is an extension of the of 3. till be considered as a (causative) 279 walked problems arise in connection with the distribution of support verbs: = Max look a walk noun or a nominalized verb accepts a certain set of support verbs and this set varies with each nominal; Her remarks are important for Jo not every verb is a support verb; thus in the sentence described Bob&apos;s love for Jo = Her remarks are of a certain importance for Jo = Her remarks have a certain importance for Jo describe not a The is then to delimit set of it set can be isolated, or resembles Max general conditions under which a verb acts as Vsup. Jo has a certain resemblance with Max of the structural Features that separates support verbs from other verbs is the possibility of clefting noun complements. Jo (bears, carries) a certain resemblance with Max example, Jo is noun complement of the same type in both structures, but we observe = There is a certain resemblance between Jo and Max *It is for Jo that Max described Bob&apos;s love is then clear that the roots important the other noun phrases. We call support verbs is for Jo that Bob has love verbs in such sentences that have no selectional function. Some support verbs are semantically neutral, others The main semantic difference between the two constructions lies in introduce modal or aspectual meanings, as for example in the cyclic structure of the graph. This cyclic structure is also found in more complex sentences such as</abstract>
<author confidence="0.830193">Bob loves Jo Bob is in love with Jo Bob fell in love with Jo Bob has a deep love for Jo</author>
<abstract confidence="0.990728908333333">fall, other motion verbs do, introduces an inchoative meaning. In this example, the main semantic relation holds between and the support verbs simply add their meaning to the relation. (5) This note put her remarks in contradiction with your plan (6) Bob gave a certain importance to her remarks to put give two complements, exactly as in sentences such as Bob put (the book)i the drawet)2 Bob gave Jo)2 use dependency tree to schematize the relations in While in (7) and (8), there is no evidence of any formal relation simple sentences, we can oppose ordinary verbs with one object and between both complements, in (5) and (6) we find dependencies support verbs of superficially identical structures such as in already observed on support verbs (cf. figure 2). figure 1: gave importance--to herr marks Max love Bob&apos;s tor Jo has put love The note her remarks in contradiction Jo with Figure 1 Figure 2 280 verbs put give are minimal, for they only introduce a causative and/or an agentive argument with to the sentence with We such verbs operator are other operator verbs that add various modalities to the minimal meanings, as in The note introduced a contradiction between her remarks and your plan Bob attributed a certain importance to her remarks Other syntactic shapes are found: Bob credited her remarks with a certain importance the set of nouns (supported by Vsup) which the vary from verb to verb. As a consequence, we have to the distributions of and Vops respect to nominals by means of a matrix such as the one in Table 4. In each row, we place a noun and each column contains a support verb an operator verb. A preliminary classification of (and has made in terms of a few elementary support verbs have, to be Prep). In a sense, this representation is symmetrical with the representation of free sentences. With free sentences, the verb is taken as the central item of the sentence. Varying then the nouns allowed with the verb does not change fundamentally the meaning of the corresponding sentences. With support verbs, the central item is a noun. Varying then the support verbs only introduces a distributional-like change in meaning. The recognition procedure has to be modified, in order to account for this component of the language: first, the look-up procedure must determine whether a verb is an verb (i.e. an entry a row of the lexicon-grammar) a Vop, are to be found in columns: simultaneously, nouns have to up in order to check their combination with support verbs. 4. CONCLUSION We have shown that simple sentence structures were of varied types. At the same time, we have seen that their representation in of the entries &amp;quot;linear&amp;quot; dictionaries, that is, terms of or otherwise ordered, is inadequate. An improvement appears to involve the look-up of two-dimensional patterns, for example the matrices we proposed for frozen sentences and their generalization to support verbs and operator verbs. More generally, syntactic structures are determined by combinations of a verb morpheme with one or more noun morpheme(s). Hence, the general way to access the lexicon will have be through the selections, matrix of Tables 3 In practice, syntactic computations are context-free computations in natural language processing. Context-free algorithms have been studied in many respects by computer scientists, theoreticians and specialists of programming languages. The principles of these algorithms are clearly understood and currently in use, even for natural languages where new problems arise because of the numerous ambiguities and the various terminologies attached to each theoretical viewpoint. • The fact that context-tree recognition is a mastered technique has certainly contributed to the shaping of the grammars used in automatic parsing. The numerous sample grammars presented so far are practically all context-tree. There is also a deep linguistic reason for building context-free grammars: natural languages use processes to avoid discontinuous structures. attention has been paid to the complex syntactic phenomena occurring in simple sentences and to the organization of the lexicon. The fact that we could not separate the syntactic of verbs from their lexical features has led construct a representation for linguistic phenomena which is more specific than the current context-tree models. A context-free will still be useful in the parsing process, it be relevant only to embedded structures found in complex sentences, with not much incidence on meaning. To summarize, the syntactic patterns are determined by pairs (verb, noun): the frozen sentence kick the bucket thus entirely while the pair bull) be by the second complement the horns, thus a more complex device to be identified; (take, walk) and (take, food) support so are faith) and (have, food); the verbs kick with object ordinary sentence forms. But the selectional process for structures may not be direct. The words in the previously discussed pairs may not appear in the input text. Words appearing in the input are then related to the words in the selectional matrix by: classificational relations: soup, etc. object chair, etc. relations between support sentences, such as Jo (had, fookthrew out) some food Jo (took, was out for. went out for) a walk Jo (has, keeps, looses) faith in Bob between support and operator sentences: This gave to Jo faith in Bob these relations add a third dimension to the selectional matrix. complete selectional now a complex network of relations that cross-relates the entries. It will have to be organized in order to optimize the speed of parsing algorithms.</abstract>
