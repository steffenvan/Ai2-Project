This paper presents in implemented theory for
quantifying noun phrases in clauses containing copular
verbs (e.g.. &apos;be&apos; and &apos;become&apos;). Proceeding from recent
theoretical work by Jackendolf WWI, this computational
theory recognizes the dependence ()I&apos; the quantification
decision on the definiteness. indefiniteness, or clir;sness
()I&apos; both the subject and object of copular verbs in
English. Jackendoffs intuition about the quantilicational
interdependence of subject and object has been imported
In tin his broader cognitive theory and reformulated
within a constraint propagation framework, Extensions
reported here include. the addition of more active
deter miners. the expansion of determiner categories, and
the treatment or displaced objects. A further finding is
tht:t quantilicational constraints may propagate across
some clausal boundaries. The algorithm is used by the
RELATUS Natural Language Understanding System
during a phase of analysis that posts constraints to
produce a &apos;constraint tree.&apos; This phase comes after
creation of syntactic deep structure and before sentential
reference in a semantic-network model. Incorporation of
the quantification algorithm in a larger system that parses
sentences and builds semantic models from them makes
RELATUS able to acquire taxonotnic and identity
in formation from text.

-1 lie quantification of noun phrases,
determining their universality or individuality, is critical
for the automatic acquisition of taxonomic and identity
information from natural language sentences. Automatic
acquisition can convert ordinary texts into sources of
taxonomic and identity information for use by learning
and reasoning programs in artificial intelligence. Such
information can also find use in efforts to develop
selection restrictions from lexical sources. Of course,
proper quantification of noun phrases also plays a key
role in computer programs that endeavor to understand
natural language.
&apos;the theory for computing the quantilicational
status of noun phrases for the case ()I copular verbs (e.g..
&apos;be&apos; and &apos;become&apos;) was inspired by recent theoretical
work of Jackendoff fackendolf noted that

constraint tree is used to perform intersentential

semantic-network model) [Mafiery, 19)01. &amp;quot;l &apos;he input to
constraint-posting phase is both surlace structure and
deep structure canonicalited hy a transformational parser
Puffy, 191S5a). In a depth-first, bottom up walk of the
deep structure, constraints describing grammatical
rclations are posted on non-terminal parse-graph nodes.3
When verbs in minor clauses (i.e.. clauses other than
relative clatises or clausal adjuncts) are reached, they
supervise the quantification of noun phrases they
command. H. these verbs are copular verbs, the copular
interconstraint algorithm is applied. In other cases,
another experimental algorithm perliums quantification
by drawing on logical relations l&apos;rom surface structure.
The result of this process is the sentential constraint tree.
It is a hierarchical description of grammatical and logical
relations that is suitable input for the reference system.
By sequentially referencing the sentences of a text, a
semantic model of the text is incrementally constructed.

Within a constraint-posting framework, the
basic task of NP quantification is to decide whether to
post a constraint marking the NP as an individual or a
universal. Since the task involves knowing the specific
subject and object of a copular verb, it is delegated to a
higher constituent, the verb. I his delegation is
motivated by the principle of local decision-molting which
holds that decisions should be located where all required
inhumation is both available and proximate. In this case,
only the verb knows the identities (if both thmn phrases
due to the hietarchical structure ()t erammatical ielations.
•Ihus, when a verb posts its own tat:rent MI constraints, it
also directs the quantification of NI&apos;s that it dominates
(e.g., its subject and o)ject).
This procedure was reformulated in a constraint
propagation [Waltz, 19751 franiev.oik because features of
a single constituent cannot be determined independently
of other constituents in the sentential &amp;Ovation. Since
qtiantilicational constraint propagates in both directions,
this process is a type of CrillAlinielit
kuttmately, the possible states of NPs are only three:
definite. indefinite. and class. Because the number of
possible Ni&apos; states is small (3) and the numher of
variables is also small (2), a simple table-lookup

3. At present. the RFLATUS system builds sentential
constraints using the canonical grammatical relations of the
sentence, the quantification status of noun phrases, and the
truth values of verbs. Work is in progress to incorporate
temporal constraints on verbs. temporal adjectives, and various
types of context markers.
4. The RELATUS parser uses non-standard parse graphs. A
&apos;kern&apos; corresponds to a clause while a &apos;verbal&apos; is something like
a verb phrase except that the kern tells it what its subject,
object, and modifiers are at constraint-posting time. For

In his discussion, Jackendolf [1983: 77-106, esp.
88-91. 94-1061 only categorizes determiners according to
the distinction between definite and indefinite . I have
added classness to his scheme in order to cope with such
determiners as &apos;any&apos; and &apos;every&apos;. While lackendoffs
examples use only the determiners &apos;a&apos;, &apos;an&apos;, and &apos;the&apos;, I
have found interpretations lig additional determiners
which are summarized in figure 2. Jackendoll considers
proper nouns to be definite and the same is done here,
except in certain cases of plural proper nouns which are
interpreted as the plural indefinite (see S2I in fiettre 5).
The taldition of the class categorization calls for the class
determiners in the bottom of figure 2.
The determiner, &apos;no&apos;, is treated as the negation
of &apos;all.&apos; Thus, the NP is quantified as a class and the
copula negated. While SIO and S18 in figure 5 are valid,
S19 is not. There are restrictions on where &apos;no* can
appear. It cannot modify both the subject ond object.
Nor can it modify the object when the subject is
indefinite (S19) or a universal (520), but it can when the
subject is definite (S18). These restrictions seem
generally valid Or literal cases even though some
idiomatic and metaphorical constructions may vii date
them.
Various cases of determiner-less NPs are
handled by the algorithm that determines NP
definiteness. Those cases are listed in Figure 3. The
indefinite category may be incompletely handled because
the theory does not yet encompass partitives -- indefinite
NI&apos;s that partition collections of individuals or universals.
11111S, determiner-less NI&apos;s with plural head nouns are not
analyzed for partitive readings.

Partitive determiners may engender two
readings. I he NPs they modify can he read as either
colle;:tions of individuals or universals. Sonic partitive
determiners such as &apos;some,&apos; &apos;each,&apos; &apos;most&apos;, &apos;few&apos;, or &apos;many&apos;
are used to make statements about subsets of a collection.
With the exception of &apos;some,&apos; these are missing from
figure 2 pending research about how to determine their
quantification. &apos;Some is interpreted just as an indefinite
because of its high frequency. .1 he determiners &apos;all,&apos;
&apos;any,&apos; and &apos;every,&apos; were included because they refer to the
entirety of a collection. None of the partitive
determiners, even the ones currently used to determine
classness. vill he adequately handled until completion of
continuing work on the syntactic parse graphs and the
interaction characteristics of partitives.
Sometimes copular verbs take adjectives in the
object position, leaving no apparent object. Some of
these adjectives have a displaced object as in S2, S11, Si).
Sb and S16 in figure S. Were there actually no object,
the quantilication of the subject would he determined in
isoiution (using a dilThrent algorithm). When the
adjective has an object. that object is used to perform the
NP interconstraint with the subject. Cases C6 and C3 are
impossible (S22 and S24) unless the sentences have
displaced objects (S11 and S1)). I lowever, this is not the
case. for Co where a copular verb is modal and has a
partitive determiner on its object. This suggests that
partitive readings of class determiners may make these
cases acceptable and that displaced objects simply make
such a reading easier.
nbplaced .mbjeds appear as the NPs vvhich
&apos;relative pronouns- bind ill relative clauses or
appositives. 515 provides an example id interconstraint
across a relative clause. There, &apos;a philosopher&apos; is the
displaced subject of the displaced object, &apos;an Ionian
stoic.&apos; Interestingly, &apos;a philosopher&apos; is also a displaced
object with respect to Alary.&apos; Recall that constraint
posting proceeds from the bottom of the pause graph up
the hierarchy of grammatical relations with quantilication
following along and being governed by major verbs. In
SI5, quantification interconstrami is first applied to &apos;a
philosopher&apos; and &apos;an Ionian stoic&apos; by the copula of the
relative clause. [hen, it is applied to &apos;Mary&apos; and &apos;a
philosopher&apos; hy the major copula. Since the liist NP
interconstraint fixes &apos;a philosopher&apos; as a universal, that
result is then carried over into the imerconstraint with
&apos;Mary.. In both S15 and S16, die quantificational
constrain&apos;, proparates across clausal boundaries because
both clause share the same NP as an object and a subject.
Cases such as these should not lead to inconsistent
quantifications. Instead, they should agree. attesting to
the soundness of the algorithm.
Jackendolf [1983: 971 argues that cases C4 and
C5 in figure 4 are semantically ambiguous. This
ambiguity seems only to hold for the determiner &apos;the&apos; and
is resolved by a simple relerence of the NP in the
semantic rcpresentation.6 if the ambiguous NP has no
referent in the current discourse focus [Gross, 1971, then
the NP must be a universal. If there is a referent, it is
either a universal or an individual, and the same

interconstraint algorithm allows a class structure to be
automatically acquired. &apos;I he way in which this

Recent interest in developing lexicons to
support computer understanding of natural language
[Walker and Amster, 19851 suggests the need for effective
methods of augmenting our lexicographical knowledge
using large corpora and unrestricted text. Selection
restrictions are an important type of information to
accumulate because they are needed not only to
distinguish different senses of words but also to recognize
metaphorical uses. Since accumulation of selection
restrictions requires it, acquisition of taxonomic
inlbrmation is a priority. The copular interconstraint
algorithm introduced in this paper provides a basis fbr
acquiring large taxonomies from unrestricted texts. A
lifter can he used to quickly prune all non-copular
sentences zis well as difficult copular sentences involving
helief, and perhaps, time contexts. The remaining
sentences can be parsed, quantified and represented in a
large semantic model.
This research would not only advance our
knowledge of natural taxonomies and selection
restrictions hut it would also generate empirical data
useful Ibr those studying &apos;default logics and stereotype
hierarchies [Minsky, 1975; Keil, 1979; Reiter, 1980;
Brachman, 1982; Etherington and Reiter, 19831. One
difficulty with this research program is that an
uncertainty principle is at work: The taxonomy used to
determine selection restrictions itself depends on
recognition of metaphors through selection restrictions.
Success in this lexicographical task will require the
careful development of effective research strategies.

<abstract confidence="0.997714230769231">This paper presents in implemented theory for quantifying noun phrases in clauses containing copular and &apos;become&apos;). Proceeding from recent theoretical work by Jackendolf WWI, this computational theory recognizes the dependence ()I&apos; the quantification decision on the definiteness. indefiniteness, or clir;sness ()I&apos; both the subject and object of copular verbs in English. Jackendoffs intuition about the quantilicational of subject and has been imported In tin his broader cognitive theory and reformulated within a constraint propagation framework, Extensions here the addition more active deter miners. the expansion of determiner categories, and treatment objects. A further finding is tht:t quantilicational constraints may propagate across some clausal boundaries. The algorithm is used by the RELATUS Natural Language Understanding System during a phase of analysis that posts constraints to produce a &apos;constraint tree.&apos; This phase comes after of syntactic deep structure and before in a semantic-network model. of quantification in a larger system that parses sentences and builds semantic models from them makes RELATUS able to acquire taxonotnic and identity in formation from text.</abstract>

<context position="22949" citStr="Etherington and Reiter, 1983" startWordPosition="3476" endWordPosition="3479">d in this paper provides a basis fbr acquiring large taxonomies from unrestricted texts. A lifter can he used to quickly prune all non-copular sentences zis well as difficult copular sentences involving helief, and perhaps, time contexts. The remaining sentences can be parsed, quantified and represented in a large semantic model. This research would not only advance our knowledge of natural taxonomies and selection restrictions hut it would also generate empirical data useful Ibr those studying &apos;default logics and stereotype hierarchies [Minsky, 1975; Keil, 1979; Reiter, 1980; Brachman, 1982; Etherington and Reiter, 19831. One difficulty with this research program is that an uncertainty principle is at work: The taxonomy used to determine selection restrictions itself depends on recognition of metaphors through selection restrictions. Success in this lexicographical task will require the careful development of effective research strategies.
