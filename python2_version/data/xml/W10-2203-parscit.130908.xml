The problem of the acquisition of Phono-
tactics in OT is shown to be not tractable
in its strong formulation, whereby con-
straints and generating function vary arbi-
trarily as inputs of the problem.
Tesar and Smolensky (1998) consider the ba-
sic ranking problem in Optimality Theory (OT).
According to this problem, the learner needs to
find a ranking consistent with a given set of data.
They show that this problem is solvable even in its
strong formulation, namely without any assump-
tions on the generating function or the constraint
set. Yet, this basic ranking problem is too sim-
ple to realistically model any actual aspect of lan-
guage acquisition. To make the problem more re-
alistic, we might want, for instance, to require the
learner to find not just any ranking consistent with
the data, rather one that furthermore generates a
smallest language (w.r.t. set inclusion). Prince and
Tesar (2004) and Hayes (2004) note that this com-
putational problem models the task of the acquisi-
tion of phonotactics within OT. This paper shows
that, contrary to the basic ranking problem consid-
ered by Tesar and Smolensky, this more realistic
problem of the acquisition of phonotactics is not
solvable, at least not in its strong formulation. I
conjecture that this complexity result has nothing
to do with the choice of the OT framework, namely
that an analogous result holds for the correspond-
ing problem within alternative frameworks, such
as Harmonic Grammar (Legendre et al., 1990b;
Legendre et al., 1990a). Furthermore, I conjec-
ture that the culprit lies with the fact that gener-
ating function and constraint set are completely
unconstrained. From this perspective, this paper
motivates the following research question: to find
phonologically plausible assumptions on generat-
ing function and constraint set that make the prob-
lem of the acquisition of phonotactics tractable.

basic Ranking problem (Rpbm) is (6). The learner
is provided with a set of data D corresponding to
some target language; and has to come up with a
ranking compatible with those data D.
given: an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y; (6)
find: a ranking » over the constraint set
C that is OT-compatible with D.
At the current stage of the development of the
field, we have no firm knowledge of the actual
universal specifications. Thus, the Rpbm (6) is
of little interest. It is standard practice in the OT
computational literature to get around this diffi-
culty by switching to the strong formulation (7),
whereby the universal specifications vary arbitrar-
ily as an input to the problem (Wareham, 1998;
Eisner, 2000; Heinz et al., 2009). Switching from
(6) to (7) presupposes that the learner does not rely
on peculiar properties of the actual universal spec-
ifications.
given: univ. specs (X, Y, Gen, C), (7)
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y;
find: a ranking » over the constraint set
C that is OT-compatible with D.
To complete the statement of the Rpbm (7), we
need to specify the size of its instances, that de-
termines the time that a solution algorithm is al-
lowed to take. Let width(D) be the cardinality of
the largest candidate set over all underlying forms
that appear in D, as stated in (8).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.86271">
width(D) def = max(x,ˆy)ED |Gen(x) |(8)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.894064538461538">
Of course, the size of an instance of the Rpbm (7)
depends on the cardinality |C |of the constraint set
and on the cardinality |D |of the data set. Tesar
and Smolensky (1998) (implicitly) assume that it
also depends on width(D), as stated in (9). 1
given: univ. specs (X, Y, Gen, C), (9)
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y;
find: a ranking » of the constraint set C
that is OT-compatible with D;
size: max{|C|, |D|, width(D)}.
1A potential difficulty with the latter assumption is as
follows: width(D) could be very large, namely super-
polynomial in the number of constraints |C|; thus, letting the
size of an instance of the Rpbm depend on width(D) might
make the problem too easy, by loosening up too much the
tight dependence on |C|. Yet, this potential difficulty is harm-
less in the case of the strong formulation of the Rpbm, since
that formulation requires an algorithm to work for any univer-
sal specifications, and thus also for universal specifications
where |C |is large but width(D) small.
Tesar and Smolensky (1998) prove claim 1. This
claim is important because it shows that no harm
comes from switching to the strong formulation,
at least in the case of the Rpbm.
Claim 1 The Rpbm (9) is tractable.
Yet, the Rpbm (9) is way too simple to realisti-
cally model any aspect of acquisition. Here is a
way to appreciate this point. The two rankings
» and »&apos; in (2) are both solutions of the in-
stance of the Rpbm (9) corresponding to the uni-
versal specifications in (1) and to the data set in
(5). As noted in (4), the language correspond-
ing to » is a proper subset of the language cor-
responding to »&apos;. A number of authors have
suggested that the ranking » that corresponds to
the subset language is a “better” solution than the
ranking »&apos; that corresponds to the superset lan-
guage (Berwick, 1985; Manzini and Wexler, 1987;
Prince and Tesar, 2004; Hayes, 2004). This intu-
ition is captured by problem (10): it asks not just
for any ranking OT-compatible with the data D;
rather, for one such ranking whose corresponding
language is as small as possible (w.r.t. set inclu-
sion). The latter condition requires the learner to
rule out as illicit any form which is not entailed by
the data. Problem (10) thus realistically models
the task of the acquisition of phonotactics, namely
the knowledge of licit vs. illicit forms.

find: a ranking » OT-comp. with D s.t.

with D too s.t. L(�&apos;) C L(�).
The Problem of the Acquisition of Phonotactics
(APpbm) in (10) involves the language L(�),
which in turn depends on the number of forms
in X and on the cardinality of the candidate set
Gen(x) for all underlying forms x∈X. Thus, (11)
lets the size of an instance of the APpbm depend
generously on |X |and width(X), rather than on
|D |and width(D) as in the case of the Rpbm (9).2

Prince and Tesar (2004) offer an alternative for-
mulation of the APpbm. They define a strictness
measure as a function µ that maps a ranking » to
a number µ(�) that provides a relative measure
of the cardinality of the corresponding language
L(�), in the sense that any solution of the prob-
lem (12) is a solution of the APpbm (10).3
given: univ. specs (X, Y, Gen, C), (12)
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y;
find: a ranking with minimal measure µ

As usual, assume that the constraint set Con =
F ∪ M is split up into the subset F of faith-
fulness constraints and the subset M of marked-
ness constraints. Consider the function µPT de-
fined in (13): it pairs a ranking » with the number
µPT(�) of pairs of a faithfulness constraint and a
markedness constraint such that the former is &gt;-
ranked above the latter. Prince and Tesar (2004)
conjecture that the function µPT in (13) is a strict-
ness measure. The intuition is that faithfulness
(markedness) constraints work toward (against)
preserving underlying contrasts and thus a small
language is likely to arise by having few pairs of a
faithfulness constraint ranked above a markedness
constraint.

Let me dub (12) with the mesure µPT in (13)
Prince and Tesar’s reformulation of the APpbm
(PTAPpbm), as in (14). The core idea of strictness
measures is to determine the relative strictness of
two rankings without reference to the entire set of
forms X. Thus, (14) lets the size of an instance
of PTAPpbm depend on |D |and width(D), rather
than on |X  |and width(X) as for the APpbm (11).

The APpbm (11) and the PTAPpbm (14) have fig-
ured prominently in the recent computational OT
literature. The main result of this paper is claim
3The Rpbm (7) corresponds to Empirical Risk Minimiza-
tion in the Statistical Learning literature, while problem (12)
corresponds to a regularized version thereof, with regulariza-
tion function µ.
2. This claim says that there is no efficient al-
gorithm for the APpbm nor for the PTAPpbm. I
conjecture that the culprit lies in the switch to
the strong formulation. Comparing with claim
1, I thus conclude that the switch is harmless for
the easy Rpbm, but harmful for the more realistic
APpbm and PTAPpbm.

In the next section, I prove NP-completeness of
PTAPpbm by showing that the Cyclic Ordering
problem can be reduced to PTAPpbm. I then prove
NP-completeness of APpbm by showing that
PTAPpbm can be reduced to it. NP-completeness
of APpbm holds despite the generous dependence
of its size on |X |and width(X). Furthermore, the
proof actually shows that the PTAPpbm remains
NP-complete even when the data have the sim-
plest “disjunctive structure”, namely for each un-
derlying/winner/loser form there are at most two
winner-preferring constrains.4 And furthermore
even when the data have the property that the faith-
fulness constraints are never loser-preferring.
2 Proof of the main result
Given a data set D, for every pair (x, ˆy) ∈ D of
an underlying form x and a corresponding winner
form ˆy, for every loser candidate y ∈ Gen(x) dif-
ferent from ˆy, construct a row a with |C |entries as
follows: the kth entry is an L if constraint Ck as-
signs more violations to the winner pair (x, ˆy) than
to the loser pair (x, y); it is a W if the opposite
holds; it is an E if the two numbers of violations
coincide. Organize these rows one underneath the
other into a tableau A(D), called the comparative
tableau corresponding to D. To illustrate, I give in
(15) the tableau corresponding to the data set (5).

Generalizing a bit, let A ∈ {L, E, W}m×n be a
tableau with m rows, n columns, and entries taken
from the three symbols L, E or W, called a compar-
ative tableau. Let me say that A is OT-compatible
with a ranking » iff the tableau obtained by re-
ordering the columns of A from left-to-right in
4Of course, if there were a unique winner-preferring con-
straint per underlying/winner/loser form triplet, then the data
would be OT-compatible with a unique ranking, and thus the
PTAPpbm would reduce to the Rpbm.

that the left-most entry different from E is a W in
every row. Tesar and Smolensky (1998) note that
a data set D is OT-compatible with a ranking »
iff the corresponding comparative tableau A(D)
is OT-compatible with it. Thus, the PTAPpbm
(14) is tractable iff the problem (16) is tractable.
Note that this equivalence crucially depends on
two facts. First, that the size of an instance of the
PTAPpbm depends not only on |C |and |D|, but
also on width(D). Second, that we are consider-
ing the strong formulation of the PTAPpbm, and
thus no assumptions need to be imposed on the
given comparative tableau in (16), besides it being
OT-compatible. The set F provided with an in-
stance of (16) says which one of the n columns of
the comparative tableau A correspond to faithful-
ness constraints. The size of an instance of prob-
lem (16) of course depends on the numbers m and
n of rows and columns of A.

The decision problem corresponding to (16) is
stated in (17). As it is well known, intractability
of the decision problem (17) entails intractability
of the original problem (16). In fact, if the original
problem (16) can be solved in polynomial time,
then the corresponding decision problem (17) can
be solved in polynomial time too: given an in-
stance of the decision problem (17), find a solution
» of the corresponding instance of (16) and then
just check whether µPT(�) ≤ k. From now on, I
will refer to (17) as the PTAPpbm.

Let me now introduce the problem I will reduce
to PTAPpbm. Given a finite set A = {a, b, ...}
with cardinality |A|, consider a set S ⊆ A×A of
pairs of elements of A. The set S is called linearly
compatible iff there exists a one-to-one function
7r : A → {1, 2, ... , |A|} such that for every pair
(a, b) ∈ S we have 7r(a) &lt; 7r(b). It is useful to
let S be not just a set but a multiset, namely to
allow S to contain multiple instances of the same
pair. The notion of cardinality and the subset re-
lation are trivially extended from sets to multisets.
Consider the problem (18), that I will call the Max-
ordering problem (MOpbm).
given: a finite set A, (18)
a multiset P ⊆ A × A,
an integer k ≤ |P|;
output: “yes” iff there is a linearly compat-
ible multiset S ⊆ P with |S |≥ k;
size: max{|A|, |P|}.
The PTAPpbm (17) is clearly in NP, namely it
admits a verification algorithm. Claim 3 ensures
that MOpbm (18) is NP-complete. Claim 4 shows
that MOpbm can be reduced to PTAPpbm (17). I
can thus conclude that PTAPpbm is NP-complete.
Claim 3 The MOpbm (18) is NP-complete.5
Proof. The MOpbm is obviously in NP. To show
that it is NP-complete, I need to exhibit an NP-
complete problem that can be reduced to it. Given
a finite set A = {a, b, ...} with cardinality |A|,
consider a set T ⊆ A × A × A of triplets of el-
ements of A. The set T is called linearly cycli-
cally compatible iff there exists a one-to-one func-
tion 7r : A → {1, 2, ... , |A|} such that for ev-
ery triplet (a, b, c) ∈ T either 7r(a) &lt; 7r(b) &lt; 7r(c)
or 7r(b) &lt; 7r(c) &lt; 7r(a) or 7r(c) &lt; 7r(a) &lt; 7r(b).
Consider the Cyclic Ordering problem (COpbm)
in (19).6 Galil and Megiddo (1977) prove NP-
completeness of COpbm by reduction from the
3-Satisfability problem; the COpbm is problem
[MS2] in (Garey and Johnson, 1979, p. 279).

Assume that the instance (A, T) of the COpbm

pairs in P compatible with 7r. Hence, there is a
multiset S of pairs of P with cardinality at least

instance of the MOpbm defined in (20) admits a
positive answer. Vice versa, assume that the in-

7r on A compatible with 2|T  |pairs in P. Since

Since the markedness constraints M1, ... , Mn
correspond to the elements a1, ... , an of A, a lin-
ear order 7r over A defines a ranking &gt;&gt; of the
markedness constraint M1, ... , Mn as in (27), and
viceversa. Thus, 7r is linearly compatible with a
pair (ai, aj) ∈ P iff the row of the block A in
(24) corresponding to that pair is accounted for
by ranking Mj above Mi, with no need for the
corresponding faithfulness constraint F(i,j) to do
any work. Suppose instead that Mj is not ranked
above Mi, so that the corresponding faithfulness
constraint F(i,j) needs to be ranked above Mi in
order to protect its L. What consequences does this
fact have for the measure µPT in (13)? Without
the ballast constraints M01, ... , M0d, not much: all
I could conclude is that the faithfulness constraint
F(i,j) has at least the two markedness constraints
Mi and Mj ranked below it. The ballast marked-
ness constraints M01, . . . , M0d ensure a more dra-
matic effect. In fact, the block Ai forces each of
them to be ranked below Mi. Thus, if the faithful-
ness constraint F(i,j) needs to be ranked above Mi,
then it also needs to be ranked above all the ballast
markedness constraints M01, ... , M0d. If the num-
ber d of these ballast constraints is large enough,
as in (21), then the corresponding effect on the
measure µPT in (13) is rather dramatic.

To prove that the given instance (A, P, k) of the
MOpbm has a positive answer, I thus only need
to show that |S |≥ k. Assume by contradiction
that |S |&lt; k. I can then compute as in (31). In
step (31a), I have used the definition (22) of the
threshold K. In step (31b), I have used the hy-
pothesis that the ranking &gt;&gt; is a solution of the
instance (A, F, K) of the PTAPpbm and thus its
mesure µPT does not exceed K. By (13), µPT(�)
is the total number of pairs of a faithfulness con-
straint and a markedness constraint such that the
former is &gt;&gt;-ranked above the latter. In step (31c),
I have thus lower bounded µPT(») by only con-
sidering those faithfulness constraints F(i,j) cor-
responding to pairs (ai, aj) not in S. For each
such constraint F(i,j), we have Mi &gt;&gt; Mj, by
the definition (30) of S. Thus, F(i,j) needs to
be &gt;&gt;-ranked above Mi in order to ensure OT-
compatibility with the corresponding row of the
block A in (24). Since Mi needs to be &gt;&gt;-ranked
above the d ballast constraints Mi, ... , Md in or-
der to ensure OT-compatibility with the block Ai
in (25), then F(i,j) needs to be &gt;&gt;-ranked above
those d ballast markedness constraints too. In con-
clusion, each faithfulness constraint F(i,j) corre-
sponding to a pair (ai, aj) not in S needs to be
&gt;&gt;-ranked at least above d markedness constraints.
Since there are ` − |S |such faithfulness constraint
F(i,j) corresponding to a pair (ai, aj)6∈S, then we
get the inequality in (31d). In step (31e), I have
used the absurd hypothesis that |S |&lt; k or equiv-
alently that |S |≤ k − 1. The chain of inequalities
in (31) entails that d ≤ (` − k)n, which contra-
dicts the choice (21) of the number d of ballast
constraints.

The preceding considerations show that given
an arbitrary instance (A, P, k) of the MOpbm
(18), the corresponding instance (A,F, K) of the
PTAPpbm (17) defined in (21)-(26) admits a pos-
itive solution iff the original instance (A, P, k) of
the MOpbm does. I conclude that the MOpbm can
be reduced to the PTAPpbm. ■
Let me now turn to the APpbm (11). Once again,
in order to show that it is intractable, it is sufficient
to show that the corresponding decision problem
(32) is intractable. In fact, if problem (11) can be
solved, then (32) can be solved too: given an in-
stance of the latter, find a solution &gt;&gt; of the cor-
responding instance of the problem (11) and then
just check whether |L(�) |≤ k.8 From now on, I
will refer to (32) as the APpbm.
given: univ. specs (X, Y, Gen, C), (32)
an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y,
an integer k;
output: “yes” iff there is a ranking &gt;&gt; OT-
comp. with D s.t. the correspond-
ing language L(�) has cardinality
at most k;
size: max {|C|, |X|, width(X)}.
The APpbm (32) is clearly in NP, namely it
admits a verification algorithm. The following
claim 5 together with the NP-completeness of
PTAPpbm, entails that the APpbm is NP-complete
too, thus completing the proof of claim 2.

each of these underlying forms with a unique pair

They define a strictness measure as a function µ that maps a ranking » to a number µ(�) that provides a relative measure of the cardinality of the corresponding language L(�), in the sense that any solution of the problem (12) is a solution of the APpbm (10).3 given: univ. specs (X, Y, Gen, C), (12) an OT-comp. data set D ⊆ X × Y; find: a ranking with minimal measure µ among those OT-comp. with D.

At the current stage of the development of the field, we have no firm knowledge of the actual universal specifications. Thus, the Rpbm (6) is of little interest. It is standard practice in the OT computational literature to get around this difficulty by switching to the strong formulation (7), whereby the universal specifications vary arbitrarily as an input to the problem (Wareham, 1998; Eisner, 2000; Heinz et al., 2009).
