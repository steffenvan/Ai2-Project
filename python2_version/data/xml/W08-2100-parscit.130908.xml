Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991312277777778">
The 2008 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning is the twelfth in the series of yearly
meetings organized by SIGNLL, the ACL special interest group on natural language learning. CoNLL
2008 will be held in Manchester, UK, August 16-17, 2008, in conjunction with Coling 2008.
We are delighted to report that CoNLL’s main session received a large number of submissions. A total
of 85 papers were under consideration for the main session after several withdrawals, and of them
only 20 were accepted. This makes this year’s CoNLL especially competitive and contributes to an
interesting program. We are grateful to the program committee members for their service in evaluating
the submissions. Special thanks to the program committee members who joined on a short notice to
help with the larger than expected number of submissions.
This year CoNLL had two special themes of interest, both of which solicited papers on models that
explain natural phenomena relating to human language. The first concerned the central scientific
problem addressed by CoNLL: the study of first language acquisition. The second theme was the central
engineering problem: how to build systems that do something useful, especially complete systems that
solve real problems.
The first theme contributed to an increased number of high-quality submissions in the first language
acquisition area. Two sessions of the conference will be devoted to papers on this topic. The second
theme led to submissions in diverse traditional NLP application areas.
As in previous years, CoNLL 2008 has a shared task. This year, the conference shared task proposed
to merge the shared task topics from the last four years (2004-2007) into a unique task called ”Joint
Learning of Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies”. Both syntactic dependencies (extracted from the
Penn Treebank ) and semantic dependencies (extracted from PropBank and NomBank) were jointly
addressed under a unique unified representation.
The shared task was organized by Mihai Surdeanu, Richard Johansson, Adam Meyers, Lluis M`arquez,
and Joakim Nivre.
The call was very successful attracting the interest of more than 50 teams from all over the world,
which represented a wide variety of universities, research institutions, and companies. At the end of
the evaluation period, 22 teams submitted results (with 19 and 5 contributions to the closed and open
challenges, respectively). All this work will be presented in the conference in the form of 5 selected
oral talks and 14 posters.
In our opinion, the current shared task constitutes a qualitative step ahead and we hope that the resources
created and the body of work presented will both serve as a benchmark and have a substantial impact
on future research on syntactic-semantic parsing.
We are excited that the invited speakers at CoNLL 2008 will be Regina Barzilay and Nick Chater.
Finally, we would like to thank the SIGNLL board members for useful discussion, Erik Tjong Kim
Sang, who acted as the information officer, and especially Lluis M`arquez and Joakim Nivre, who helped
us greatly with advice around the conference organization, as well as to the organizers of COLING
