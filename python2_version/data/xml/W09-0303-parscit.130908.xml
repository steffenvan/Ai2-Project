In this study we apply and evaluate an
iterative pairwise alignment program for
producing multiple sequence alignments,
ALPHAMALIG (Alonso et al., 2004), us-
ing as material the phonetic transcriptions
of words used in Bulgarian dialectological
research. To evaluate the quality of the
multiple alignment, we propose two new
methods based on comparing each column
in the obtained alignments with the cor-
responding column in a set of gold stan-
dard alignments. Our results show that the
alignments produced by ALPHAMALIG
correspond well with the gold standard
alignments, making this algorithm suitable
for the automatic generation of multiple
string alignments. Multiple string align-
ment is particularly interesting for histor-
ical reconstruction based on sound corre-
spondences.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99996">
Our cultural heritage is studied today not only in
museums, libraries, archives and their digital por-
tals, but also through the genetic and cultural lin-
eaments of living populations. Linguists, popula-
tion geneticists, archaeologists, and physical and
cultural anthropologists are all active in research-
ing cultural heritage on the basis of material that
may or may not be part of official cultural heritage
archives. The common task is that of understand-
ing the histories of the peoples of the world, espe-
cially their migrations and contacts. To research
and understand linguistic cultural heritage we re-
quire instruments which are sensitive to its signals,
and, in particular sensitive to signals of common
provenance. The present paper focuses on pronun-
ciation habits which have been recognized to bear
signals of common provenance for over two hun-
dred years (since the work of Sir William Jones).
We present work in a research line which seeks to
submit pronunciation data to phylogenetic analy-
sis (Gray and Atkinson, 2003) and which requires
an alignment of the (phonological) segments of
cognate words. We focus in this paper on evalu-
ating the quality of multi-aligned pronunciations.
In bioinformatics, sequence alignment is a way
of arranging DNA, RNA or protein sequences in
order to identify regions of similarity and deter-
mine evolutionary, functional or structural simi-
larity between the sequences. There are two main
types of string alignment: pairwise and multiple
string alignment. Pairwise string alignment meth-
ods compare two strings at a time and cannot di-
rectly be used to obtain multiple string alignment
methods (Gusfield, 1997, 343-344). In multiple
string alignment all strings are aligned and com-
pared at the same time, making it a good technique
for discovering patterns, especially those that are
weakly preserved and cannot be detected easily
from sets of pairwise alignments. Multiple string
comparison is considered to be the holy grail of
molecular biology (Gusfield, 1997, 332):
It is the most critical cutting-edge tool for ex-
tracting and representing biologically important,
yet faint or widely dispersed, commonalities
from a set of strings.
Multiple string comparison is not new in lin-
guistic research. In the late 19th century the
Neogrammarians proposed the hypothesis of the
regularity of sound change. According to THE
NEOGRAMMARIAN HYPOTHESIS sound change
occurs regularly and uniformly whenever the ap-
propriate phonetic environment is encountered
(Campbell, 2004). Ever since, the understand-
ing of sound change has played a major role in
the comparative method that is itself based on the
simultaneous comparison of different languages,
i.e. lists of cognate terms from the related lan-
guages. The correct analysis of sound changes

requires the simultaneous examination of corre-
sponding sounds in order to compare hypotheses
about their evolution. Alignment identifies which
sounds correspond. Historical linguists align the
sequences manually, while we seek to automate
this process.
In recent years there has been a strong fo-
cus in historical linguistics on the introduction
of quantitative methods in order to develop tools
for the comparison and classification of lan-
guages. For example, in his PhD thesis, Kondrak
(2002) presents algorithms for the reconstruction
of proto-languages from cognates. Warnow et al.
(2006) applied methods taken from phylogenet-
ics on Indo-European phonetic data in order to
model language evolution. Heeringa and Joseph
(2007) applied the Levensthein algorithm to the
Dutch pronunciation data taken from Reeks Ned-
erlandse Dialectatlassen and tried to reconstruct a
‘proto-language’ of Dutch dialects using the pair-
wise alignments.
Studies in historical linguistics and dialectome-
try where string comparison is used as a basis for
calculating the distances between language vari-
eties will profit from tools to multi-align strings
automatically and to calculate the distances be-
tween them. Good multiple alignment is of ben-
efit to all those methods in diachronic linguistics
such as the comparative reconstruction method
or the so-called CHARACTER-BASED METHODS
taken from phylogenetics, which have also been
successfully applied in linguistics (Gray and Jor-
dan, 2000; Gray and Atkinson, 2003; Atkinson
et al., 2005; Warnow et al., 2006). The multi-
alignment systems can help historical linguistics
by reducing the human labor needed to detect the
regular sound correspondences and cognate pairs
of words. They also systematize the linguistic
knowledge in intuitive alignments, and provide a
basis for the application of the quantitative meth-
ods that lead to a better understanding of language
variation and language change.
In this study we apply an iterative pairwise
alignment program for linguistics, ALPHAMA-
LIG, on phonetic transcriptions of words used in
dialectological research. We automatically multi-
align all transcriptions and compare these gener-
ated alignments with manually aligned gold stan-
dard alignments. At the same time we propose
two methods for the evaluation of the multiple se-
quence alignments (MSA).
The structure of this paper is as follows. An
example of a multiple alignment and a discus-
sion of the advantages over pairwise alignment
is given in the next section, after which we dis-
cuss our data set in section 3. Section 4 explains
the iterative pairwise alignment algorithm and the
program ALPHAMALIG. Section 5 discusses the
gold standard and two baselines, while section 6
discusses the novel evaluation procedures. The re-
sults are given in section 7 and we end this paper
with a discussion in section 8.

In Figure 1 we have multi-aligned pronuncia-

of alignment over pairwise alignment are twofold:

• First, it is easier to detect and process corre-
sponding phones in words and their alterna-

column in Figure 1).
• Second, the distances/similarities between
strings can be different in pairwise compari-
son as opposed to multiple comparison. This
is so because multi-aligned strings, unlike
pairwise aligned strings, contain information
on the positions where phones were inserted
or deleted in both strings. For example,
in Figure 1 the pairwise alignment of the
pronunciations from village 1 and village 3
would be:

These two alignments have one matching el-

that the similarity between them is 1/3 =
0.33. At the same time the similarity be-
tween these two strings calculated based on
the multi-aligned strings in Figure 1 would
be 4/6 = 0.66. The measurement based on
multi-alignment takes the common missing
material into account as well.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998855">
Multiple alignment algorithms iteratively merge
two multiple alignments of two subsets of strings
into a single multiple alignment that is union of
those subsets (Gusfield, 1997). The simplest ap-
proach is to align the two strings that have the
minimum distance over all pairs of strings and it-
eratively align strings having the smallest distance
to the already aligned strings in order to generate
a new multiple alignment. Other algorithms use
different initializations and different criteria in se-
lecting the new alignments to merge. Some begin
with the longest (low cost) alignment instead of
the least cost absolutely. A string with the smallest
edit distance to any of the already merged strings
is chosen to be added to the strings in the multiple
alignment. In choosing the pair with the minimal
distance, all algorithms are greedy, and risk miss-
ing optimal alignments.
ALPHAMALIG is an iterative pairwise align-
ment program for bilingual text alignment. It uses
the strategy of merging multiple alignments of
subsets of strings, instead of adding just one string

at the time to the already aligned strings.3 It was
originally developed to align corresponding words
in bilingual texts, i.e. with textual data, but it func-
tions with any data that can be represented as a
sequence of symbols of a finite alphabet. In addi-
tion to the input sequences, the program needs to
know the alphabet and the distances between each
token pair and each pair consisting of a token and
a gap.
In order to perform multiple sequence align-
ments of X-SAMPA word transcriptions we modi-
fied ALPHAMALIG slightly so it could work with
the tokens that consist of more than one symbol,
such as [&amp;quot;e], [&amp;quot;e:] and [t_S]. The distances be-
tween the tokens were specified in such a way that
vowels can be aligned only with vowels and con-
sonants only with consonants. The same tokens
are treated as identical and the distance between
them is set to 0. The distance between any token
in the data set to a gap symbol has the same cost
as replacing a vowel with a vowel or a consonant
with a consonant. Except for this very general lin-
guistic knowledge, no other data-specific informa-
tion was given to the program. In this research we
do not use any phonetic features in order to define
the segments more precisely and to calculate the
distances between them in a more sensitive way
than just making a binary ’match/does-not-match-
distinction’, since we want to keep the system lan-
guage independent and robust to the highest pos-
sible degree.

By applying this simple method, we obtained
multiple sequence alignments for all words in our

alignment is shown in Figure 2. These align-

how much improvement is obtained using more
advanced techniques to multi-align strings.

6 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958086956522">
Although multiple sequence alignments are
broadly used in molecular biology, there is still no
widely accepted objective function for evaluating
the goodness of the multiple aligned strings
(Gusfield, 1997). The quality of the existing
methods used to produce multiple sequence
alignments is judged by the ’biological meaning
of the alignments they produce’. Since strings
in linguistics cannot be judged by the biological
criteria used in string evaluation in biology, we
were forced to propose evaluation methods that
would be suitable for the strings in question. One
of the advantages we had was the existence of
the gold standard alignments, which made our
task easier and more straightforward—in order to
determine the quality of the multi-aligned strings,
we compare outputs of the different algorithms to
the gold standard. Since there is no off-the-shelf
method that can be used for comparison of multi-
aligned strings to a gold standard, we propose
two novel methods—one sensitive to the order of
columns in two alignments and another that takes
into account only the content of each column.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994699">
6.1 Column dependent method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99934325">
The first method we developed compares the con-
tents of the columns and also takes the column se-
quence into account. The column dependent eval-
uation (CDE) procedure is as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6363733">
• Each gold standard column is compared to
the most similar column out of two neigh-
boring columns of a candidate multiple align-
ment. The two neighboring columns depend
on the previous matched column j and have
indices j + 1 and j + 2 (at the start j = 0). It
is possible that there are columns in the can-
didate multiple alignment which remain un-
matched, as well as columns at the end of the
gold standard which remain unmatched.
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.932025">
21
</page>
<listItem confidence="0.998859">
• The similarity of a candidate column with a
gold standard column is calculated by divid-
ing the number of correctly placed elements
in every candidate column by the total num-
ber of elements in the column. A score of
1 indicates perfect overlap, while a score of
0 indicates the columns have no elements in
common.
• The similarity score of the whole multiple
alignment (for a single word) is calculated by
summing the similarity score of each candi-
date column and dividing it by the total num-
ber of matched columns plus the total num-
ber of unmatched columns in both multiple
alignments.
• The final similarity score between the set of
gold standard alignments with the set of can-
didate multiple alignments is calculated by
averaging the multiple alignment similarity
scores for all strings.

in Figure 4, with the gold standard alignment (GS)
on the left and the generated alignment (GA) on

<bodyText confidence="0.999770588235294">
The evaluation starts by comparing the first col-
umn of the GS with the first and second column
of the GA. The first column of the GA is the best
match, since the similarity score between the first
columns is 0.75 (3 out of 4 elements match). In
similar fashion, the second column of the GS is
compared with the second and the third column of
the GA and matched with the third column of GA
with a similarity score of 1 (all elements match).
The third GS column is matched with the fourth
GA column, the fourth GS column with the fifth
GA column and the fifth GS column with the sixth
GA column (all three having a similarity score of
1). As a consequence, the second column of the
GA remains unmatched. In total, five columns are
matched and one column remains unmatched. The
total score of the GA equals:

<equation confidence="0.999477">
(0.75 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)
(5 + 1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983616">
It is clear that this method punishes unmatched
columns by increasing the value of the denomina-
tor in the similarity score calculation. As a conse-
quence, swapped columns are punished severely,
which is illustrated in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Two alignments with swapped columns
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913785714286">
In the alignments in Figure 5, the first three
columns of GS would be matched with the first
three columns of GA with a score of 1, the fourth
would be matched with the fifth, and two columns
would be left unmatched: the fifth GS column and
the fourth GA column yielding a total similarity
score of 4/6 = 0.66. Especially in this case this is
undesirable, as both sequences of these columns
represent equally reasonable multiple alignment
and should have a total similarity score of 1.
We therefore need a less strict evaluation method
which does not insist on the exact ordering. An
alternative method is introduced and discussed in
the following section.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998353">
6.2 Modified Rand Index
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993870652173913">
In developing an alternative evaluation we pro-
ceeded from the insight that the columns of a mul-
tiple alignment are a sort of PARTITION of the el-
ements of the alignment strings, i.e., they consti-
tute a set of disjoint multi-sets whose union is the
entire multi-set of segments in the multiple align-
ment. Each column effectively assigns its seg-
ments to a partition, which clearly cannot overlap
with the elements of another column (partition).
Since every segment must fall within some col-
umn, the assignment is also exhaustive.
Our second evaluation method is therefore
based on the modified Rand index (Hubert and
Arabie, 1985). The modified Rand index is used
in classification for comparing two different parti-
tions of a finite set of objects. It is based on the
Rand index (Rand, 1971), one of the most popular
measures for comparing the degree to which parti-
tions agree (in classification).
Given a set of n elements S = o1, ...on and two
partitions of S, U and V , the Rand index R is de-
fined as:
= 0.792

ferent sets in V
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.906267222222222">
We would like to emphasize that it is clear that
the set of columns of a multi-alignment have more
structure than a partition sec, in particular because
the columns (subpartitions) are ordered, unlike the
subpartitions in a partition. But we shall compen-
sate for this difference by explicitly marking order.

<bodyText confidence="0.998695470588235">
Consequently, a and b are the number of pairs of
elements on which two classifications agree, while
c and d are the number of pairs of elements on
which they disagree. In our case classifications
agree about concrete segment tokens only in the
cases where they appear in the same columns in
the alignments.
The value of Rand index ranges between 0 and
1, with 0 indicating that the two partitions (multi-
alignments) do not agree on any pair of points and
1 indicating that the data partitions are exactly the
same.4 A problem with the Rand index is that it
does not return a constant value (zero) if two par-
titions are picked at random. Hubert and Arabie
(1985) suggested a modification of the Rand in-
dex (MRI) that corrects this property. It can be
expressed in the general form as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.4800675">
Rand index − Expected index
Maximum index − Expected index
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999192">
The expected index is the expected number of
pairs which would be placed in the same set in U
and in the same set in V by chance. The maximum
index represents the maximum number of objects
that can be put in the same set in U and in the
same set in V . The MRI value ranges between −1
and 1, with perfect overlap being indicated by 1
and values &lt; 0 indicating no overlap. For a more
detailed explanation of the modified Rand index,
please refer to Hubert and Arabie (1985).

Both alignments in Figure 5 have 12 phones that

a single segment from each other, but note that the
way we do this also introduces an order sensitivity
in the measure. The two partitions obtained are:

GS4 = {4,121 GA4 = {81
GS5 = {81 GA5 = {4,121

<bodyText confidence="0.999749857142857">
Using the modified Rand index the quality of
each column is checked, regardless of whether the
columns are in order. The MRI for the alignments
in Figure 5 will be 1, because both alignments
group segment tokens in the same way. Even
though columns four and five are swapped, in both
classifications phones [j] and [f] are grouped to-
gether, while sound [u] forms a separate group.
The MRI itself only takes into account the
quality of each column separately since it sim-
ply checks whether the same elements are together
in the candidate alignment as in the gold-standard
alignment. It is therefore insensitive to the order-
ing of columns. While it may have seemed coun-
terintuitive linguistically to proceed from an order-
insensitive measure, the comparison of “tagged to-
kens” described above effectively reintroduces or-
der sensitivity.
In the next section we describe the results of ap-
plying both evaluation methods on the automati-
cally generated multiple alignments.

After comparing all files of the baseline algo-
rithms and ALPHAMALIG against the gold stan-
dard files according to the column dependent eval-
uation method and the modified Rand index, the
average score is calculated by summing up all
scores and dividing them by the number of word
files (152).
The results are given in Table 1 and also in-
clude the number of words with perfect multi-
alignments (i.e. identical to the gold standard).
Using CDE, ALPHAMALIG scored 0.932 out of
1.0 with 103 perfectly aligned files. The result
for the simple baseline was 0.710 with 44 per-
fectly aligned files. As expected, the result for
the advanced baseline was in between these two
results—0.869 with 72 files that were completely
identical to the GS files. Using MRI to eval-
uate the alignments generated we obtained gen-
erally higher scores for all three algorithms, but
with the same ordering. ALPHAMALIG scored
0.982, with 104 perfectly aligned files. The ad-
vanced baseline had a lower score of 0.937 and
74 perfect alignments. The simple baseline per-
formed worse, scoring 0.848 and having 44 per-
fectly aligned files.
The scores of the CDE evaluation method are
lower than the MRI scores, which is due to the first
method’s problematic sensitivity to column order-
ing in the alignments. It is clear that in both evalu-
ation methods ALPHAMALIG outperforms both
baseline alignments by a wide margin.
It is important to notice that the scores for the
simple baseline are reasonably high, which can
be explained by the structure of our data set.
The variation of word pronunciations is relatively
small, making string alignment easier. However,
ALPHAMALIG obtained much higher scores us-
ing both evaluation methods.
Additional qualitative error analysis reveals that
the errors of ALPHAMALIG are mostly caused by
the vowel-vowel consonant-consonant alignment
restriction. In the data set there are 21 files that
contain metathesis. Since vowel-consonant align-
ments were not allowed in ALPHAMALIG, align-
ments produced by this algorithm were different
from the gold standard, as illustrated in Figure 7.
The vowel-consonant restriction is also respon-
sible for wrong alignments in some words where
metathesis is not present, but where the vowel-
consonant alignment is still preferred over align-

ing vowels and/or consonants with a gap (see for
example Figure 4).
The other type of error present in the AL-
PHAMALIG alignments is caused by the fact
that all vowel-vowel and consonant-consonant dis-
tances receive the same weight. In Figure 8
the alignment of word bjahme ’were’ produced
by ALPHAMALIG is wrong because instead of
aligning [mJ] with [m] and [m] it is wrongly
aligned with [x] and [x], while [x] is aligned with
[f] instead of aligning it with [x] and [x].

In this study we presented a first attempt to auto-
matically multi-align phonetic transcriptions. The
algorithm we used to generate alignments has been
shown to be very reliable, produce alignments of
good quality, with less than 2% error at the seg-
ment level. In this study we used only very sim-
ple linguistic knowledge in order to align strings.
The only restriction we imposed was that a vowel
should only be aligned with a vowel and a con-
sonant only with a consonant. The system has
shown to be very robust and to produce good qual-
ity alignments with a very limited information on
the distances between the tokens. However, in the
future we would like to apply this algorithm using
more detailed segment distances, so that we can
work without vowel-consonant restrictions. Using
more detailed language specific feature system for
each phone, we believe we may be able to improve
the produced alignments further. This especially
holds for the type of errors illustrated in Figure 8
where it is clear that [mJ] is phonetically closer to
[m] than to [x] sound.
As our data set was relatively simple (indicated
by the reasonable performance of our simple base-
line algorithm), we would very much like to eval-
uate ALPHAMALIG against a more complex data

tained here. On one hand, high performance of
both baseline algorithms show that our task was
relatively easy. On the other hand, achieving per-
fect alignments will be very difficult, if possible at
all.
Additionally, we proposed two methods to eval-
uate multiple aligned strings in linguistic research.
Although these systems could be improved, both
of them are giving a good estimation of the qual-
ity of the generated alignments. For the examined
data, we find MRI to be better evaluation tech-
nique since it overcomes the problem of swapped
columns.
In this research we tested and evaluated AL-
PHAMALIG on the dialect phonetic data. How-
ever, multiple sequence alignments can be also
applied on the sequences of sentences and para-
graphs. This makes multiple sequence alignment
algorithm a powerful tool for mining text data in
social sciences, humanities and education.

To evaluate the quality of the multiple alignment, we propose two new methods based on comparing each column in the obtained alignments with the corresponding column in a set of gold standard alignments.

Multiple string comparison is considered to be the holy grail of molecular biology (Gusfield, 1997, 332): It is the most critical cutting-edge tool for extracting and representing biologically important, yet faint or widely dispersed, commonalities from a set of strings. Multiple string comparison is not new in linguistic research. In the late 19th century the Neogrammarians proposed the hypothesis of the regularity of sound change. According to THE NEOGRAMMARIAN HYPOTHESIS sound change occurs regularly and uniformly whenever the appropriate phonetic environment is encountered (Campbell, 2004). Ever since, the understanding of sound change has played a major role in the comparative method that is itself based on the simultaneous comparison of different languages, i.e. lists of cognate terms from the related languages.

The simplest approach is to align the two strings that have the minimum distance over all pairs of strings and iteratively align strings having the smallest distance to the already aligned strings in order to generate a new multiple alignment. Other algorithms use different initializations and different criteria in selecting the new alignments to merge. Some begin with the longest (low cost) alignment instead of the least cost absolutely. A string with the smallest edit distance to any of the already merged strings is chosen to be added to the strings in the multiple alignment. In choosing t</context>

The quality of the existing methods used to produce multiple sequence alignments is judged by the ’biological meaning of the alignments they produce’. Since strings in linguistics cannot be judged by the biological criteria used in string evaluation in biology, we were forced to propose evaluation methods that would be suitable for the strings in question. One of the advantages we had was the existence of the gold standard alignments, which made our task easier and more straightforward—in order to determine the quality of the multi-aligned strings, we compare outputs of the different algorit</context>

Both alignments in Figure 5 have 12 phones that are put into 5 groups. We “tag” each token sequentially in order to distinguish the different tokens of a single segment from each other, but note that the way we do this also introduces an order sensitivity in the measure. The two partitions obtained are: GS1 = {1,5,91 GA1 = {1,5,91 GS2 = {2,6,101 GA2 = {2,6,101 GS3 =</context>

We refer to both sequences in a pairwise alignment as ALIGNMENT LINES. Note that alignment lines include hyphens indicating the places of insertions and deletions. 3. the alignment lines—all of equal length—are extracted 4. all extracted alignment lines are placed below each other to form the multiple alignment An example of combining pairwise alignments against the longest string (in this case [j&apos;aze]) is shown in Figure 3. 5.3 Gold standard Our gold standard was created by manually correcting the advanced baseline alignments described in the previous section.

Each column effectively assigns its segments to a partition, which clearly cannot overlap with the elements of another column (partition). Since every segment must fall within some column, the assignment is also exhaustive. Our second evaluation method is therefore based on the modified Rand index (Hubert and Arabie, 1985). The modified Rand index is used in classification for comparing two different partitions of a finite set of objects. It is based on the Rand index (Rand, 1971), one of the most popular measures for comparing the degree to which partitions agree (in classification). Given a set of n elements S = o1, ...on and two partitions of S, U and V , the Rand index R is defined as: = 0.792 22 a + b R= a + b + c + d where: • a: the number of pairs of elements in S that are in the same set (column) in U and in the same set in V • b: the number of pairs of elements in S that are in different sets (columns)</context>

In our case classifications agree about concrete segment tokens only in the cases where they appear in the same columns in the alignments. The value of Rand index ranges between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that the two partitions (multialignments) do not agree on any pair of points and 1 indicating that the data partitions are exactly the same.4 A problem with the Rand index is that it does not return a constant value (zero) if two partitions are picked at random. Hubert and Arabie (1985) suggested a modification of the Rand index (MRI) that corrects this property. It can be expressed in the general form as: Rand index − Expected index Maximum index − Expected index The expected index is the expected number of pairs which would be placed in the same set in U and in the same set in V by chance. The maximum index represents the maximum number of objects that can be put in the same set in U and in the same set in V . The MRI value ranges between −1 and 1, with perfect overlap being indicated by 1 and values &lt; 0 indicating no overlap. For a more detailed explanation of the modifie</context>
