Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999228555555555">
Drug name entity recognition focuses on
identifying concepts appearing in the text that
correspond to a chemical substance used in
pharmacology for treatment, cure, prevention
or diagnosis of diseases. This paper describes
a system based on ontologies for identifying
the chemical substances in biomedical text.
The system achieves an F-1 measure of 0.529
in the task.

<bodyText confidence="0.998428176470588">
Named entity recognition (NER) involves
processing text and identifying certain occurrences
of words belonging to particular categories of
named entities. In recent years, much attention has
been paid to the problem of recognizing gene and
protein mentions in biomedical abstracts for
different purposes such as information extraction,
relation extraction or information retrieval. In this
case we focus on the pharmacological domain.
Furthermore, some initiatives have promoted the
evaluation of different systems of named entity
recognition and relation extraction in the
pharmacological domain. This is the case of
Semeval 2013: Recognition and classification of
drug names task1 (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2013),
where the system presented in this communication
has been evaluated.

Following the annotation guidelines of the task, a
drug is a substance that is used in the treatment,
cure, prevention or diagnosis of disease. Moreover,
each drug name entity can be classified in four
different types: drug, brand, drug_n and group.
Our system uses biomedical ontologies and
external resources (containing biomedical
information) as input to determine whether we are
treating a drug name entity or not.
The resource integration seems to represent an
improvement since the knowledge available for
identifying entities is higher. Some biomedical
resources such as Drugbank2, Kegg3, Pubchem4 or
Drugs.com5 focus on providing a compound of
information collected from different sources.
Section 2 exposes some related work in the field
of NER. In section 3 we describe the system used
for identifying drug name entities. Section 4
presents the results obtained by the system and a
little comparison with other approaches. In section
5 we outline some conclusions obtained and ideas
for future work.

The concept recognition tool used by the OBA
system -in order to find ontology concepts
matching the terms extracted from texts- is called
Mgrep. Although Mgrep is not a free tool, some
results are presented in (Jonquet et al., 2008). A

The system (see figure 1) is divided in two phases:
(i) in one hand, the system must scan drug name
entities without specifying any further information.
This is the so-called entity identification process;
(ii) on the other hand, the system classifies by
using a rule-based process the type of the entities
discovered previously. This is the so-called entity
classification process.
The corpus is processed sentence by sentence,
using the identification tag provided for each
sentence.

set the ontologies we want to use in the analysis.
All additional ontologies used in the analysis
increases the computational complexity required.

over 213,000 entry terms in 2013 MeSH.
For each drug name entity identified the Mgrep
analyzer provides information about the ontology
concept recognized, term information, snippet of
original text (see figure 2a). After identifying drug
name entities we noticed some errors in the
recognized concepts, thus we held a post-
processing of the analysis results. Some entities are
recognized by several ontologies at the same time,
so it is necessary to filter repeated instances.
Biomedical complex name entities are not
identified. To solve this, we join compound name
entities by following the charoffset of the sentence.
The system only links two or more drug entities
that were next to each other, without punctuation
between them. For example, potassium chloride
(see figure 2b) is recognized separately in
potassium and chloride, so we group it as
potassium chloride concept.
As a result of this process we obtain a list of
clear drug name entities that conforms our run 1
approach in the task. However, we elaborate a
second filter based in a gazetteer containing terms
with no useful meaning for our drug name entity
identification purpose. This gazetteer contains
terms such as agent, compound and blocker. The
results of this second filter conforms our run 2
approach in the task. As a result of entity
identification phase we obtain a list of drug name
entities, but they are not identified as any type yet.

The described rules are representative examples
of the complete rule-based system. There were
assigned priorities to the rules, since some rules are
more certain to describe a drug type than others.
Thus, if a drug entity is found to be approved for
using in humans after processing the MeSH text,
but when looking the DrugBank state is found as
illicit state, then the drug is classified as drug_n
type since DrugBank offers a certain state of the
drug, instead of a natural text description that may
be classified as a false positive. Depending on the

rule-based system determines whether the type of
an entity is a drug, group, brand or drug_n.

These results contrast with the result obtained by

in entity identification and strict matching
evaluation respectively. Thus we can quantify the
advantage of using a filter based on gazetteer in an
average increment of 0.079 F1 measure.
We have noticed that the higher results are
obtained in partial matching evaluation because of
the relaxed conditions of the charoffset. This seems
reasonable since complex multiword entity is hard
to parse and define an exact charoffset.
On the other hand, we also noticed that

still a lot of improvement work in the rule-based

training dataset. The results show errors in
conflictive entities that show multiples categories

5 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994798">
In this paper we present a system for drug name
entity recognition based on ontologies as
participation for “Semeval 2013: Recognition and
classification of drug names” task. The system is
based on integration of biomedical resources for
identification and classification of pharmacological
entities. The best result of the system obtained an
F1 measure of 0.529.
The usage of ontologies in named entity
recognition task seems to be a good choice since
we can select specific ontologies. A possible future
work includes an improvement of rule-based
system, including a bigger collection of biomedical
resources. The entity classification could increase
the results by creating an hybrid approach between
rule-based methods and machine learning
techniques. On the other hand, in the entities
identification task, the system could include other
biomedical text analyzers and establish a vote
system. This would improve whether we consider
an entity or not. Finally, in error analysis were
noticed problems related to rule-based module.
Therefore, an insightful improve could pass
through making a context analysis in order to clear
the ambiguity surrounding the drug entity.

In recent years, much attention has been paid to the problem of recognizing gene and protein mentions in biomedical abstracts for different purposes such as information extraction, relation extraction or information retrieval. In this case we focus on the pharmacological domain. Furthermore, some initiatives have promoted the evaluation of different systems of named entity recognition and relation extraction in the pharmacological domain. This is the case of Semeval 2013: Recognition and classification of drug names task1 (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2013), where the system presented in this communication has been evaluated. 1 http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval2013/task9/data/uploads/task-9.1-drug-ner.pdf Following the annotation guidelines of the task, a drug is a substance that is used in the treatment, cure, prevention or diagnosis of disease. Moreover, each drug name entity can be classified in four different types: drug, brand, drug_n and group. Our system uses biomedical ontologies and external resources (containing biomedical information) as input to determine whether we are treating a drug name entity or not.
