We describe a pilot project in semi-
automatically refactoring a biomedical
corpus. The total time expended was just
over three person-weeks, suggesting that
this is a cost-efficient process. The refac-
tored corpus is available for download at

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.997631965517242">
Cohen et al. (2005) surveyed the usage rates of a
number of biomedical corpora, and found that most
biomedical corpora have not been used outside of
the lab that created them. Empirical data on corpus
design and usage suggests that one major factor af-
fecting usage is the format in which it is distributed.
These findings suggest that there would be a large
benefit to the community in refactoring these cor-
pora. Refactoring is defined in the software en-
gineering community as altering the internal struc-
ture of code without altering its external behav-
ior (Fowler et al., 1999). We suggest that in the con-
text of corpus linguistics, refactoring means chang-
ing the format of a corpus without altering its con-
tents, i.e. its annotations and the text that they de-
scribe. The significance of being able to refactor a
large number of corpora should be self-evident: a
likely increase in the use of the already extant pub-
licly available data for evaluating biomedical lan-
guage processing systems, without the attendant cost
of repeating their annotation.
We examined the question of whether corpus
refactoring is practical by attempting a proof-of-
concept application: modifying the format of the
Protein Design Group (PDG) corpus described in
Blaschke et al. (1999) from its current idiosyncratic
format to a stand-off annotation format (WordF-
reak1) and a GPML-like (Kim et al., 2001) embed-
ded XML format.

<bodyText confidence="0.927456260869565">
The target WordFreak and XML-embedded formats
were chosen for two reasons. First, there is some
evidence suggesting that standoff annotation and
embedded XML are the two most highly preferred
corpus annotation formats, and second, these for-
mats are employed by the two largest extant curated
biomedical corpora, GENIA (Kim et al., 2001) and
BioIE (Kulick et al., 2004).
The PDG corpus we refactored was originally
constructed by automatically detecting protein-
protein interactions using the system described in
Blaschke et al. (1999), and then manually review-
ing the output. We selected it for our pilot project
because it was the smallest publicly available cor-
pus of which we were aware. Each block of text has
a deprecated MEDLINE ID, a list of actions, a list of
proteins and a string of text in which the actions and
proteins are mentioned. The structure and contents
of the original corpus dictate the logical steps of the
refactoring process:
1. Determine the current PubMed identifier, given
the deprecated MEDLINE ID. Use the PubMed
identifier to retrieve the original abstract.

Between each file creation step above, human cu-

cess is structured this way so that from one step to
the next we are assured that all data is valid, thereby
giving the automation the best chance of performing
well on the subsequent step.

The refactored PDG corpus is publicly available at
http://bionlp.sourceforge.net. Total time expended
to refactor the PDG corpus was 122 hours and 25
minutes, or approximately three person-weeks. Just
over 80% of the time was spent on the programming
portion. Much of that programming can be directly
applied to the next refactoring project. The remain-
ing 20% of the time was spent curating the program-
matic outputs.
Mapping IDs and obtaining the correct abstract
returned near-perfect results and required very little
curation. For the sentence extraction step, 33% of
the corpus blocks needed manual correction, which
required 4 hours of curation. (Here and below, “cu-
ration” time includes both visual inspection of out-
puts, and correction of any errors detected.) The
source of error was largely due to the fact that the
sentence extractor returned the best sentence from
the abstract, but the original corpus text was some-
times more or less than one sentence.
For the protein and action mapping step, about
40% of the corpus segments required manual cor-
rection. In total, this required about 16 hours of cu-
ration time. Distinct sources of error included par-
tial entity extraction, incorrect entity extraction, and
incorrect entity annotation in the original corpus ma-
terial. Each of these types of errors were corrected.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958782608695">
The underlying motivation for this paper is the hy-
pothesis that corpus refactoring is practical, eco-
nomical, and useful. Erjavec (2003) converted the
GENIA corpus from its native format to a TEI P4
format. They noted that the translation process
brought to light some previously covert problems
with the GENIA format. Similarly, in the process of
the refactoring we discovered and repaired a number
of erroneous entity boundaries and spurious entities.
A number of enhancements to the corpus are now
possible that in its previous form would have been
difficult at best. These include but are not limited
to performing syntactic and semantic annotation and
adding negative examples, which would expand the
usefulness of the corpus. Using revisioning soft-
ware, the distribution of iterative feature additions
becomes simple.
We found that this corpus could be refactored with
about 3 person-weeks’ worth of time. Users can take
advantage of the corrections that we made to the en-
tity component of the data to evaluate novel named
entity recognition techniques or information extrac-
tion approaches.
