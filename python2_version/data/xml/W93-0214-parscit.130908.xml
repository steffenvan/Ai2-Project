1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999128">
Moore and Pollack have recently given an analysis of RST relations in terms of intentional ver-
sus informational levels of discourse [5]. According to their (convincing) analysis, presentational
RST relations correspond to the intentional level of discourse and subject matter relations to the
informational level. For each text there should exist two RST analyses: one containing only pre-
sentational relations and the other containing only subject matter relations. Mann and Thompson
had discussed multiple analyses in RST ([1], pp. 26-30), stating that a presentational analysis
is the only analysis when both presentational and subject-matter relation definitions are satisfied
between a given pair of text spans. In their view, the presentational analysis is chosen as correct
since it describes the changes in the hearer&apos;s system of beliefs, i.e. provides deeper insights into
discourse goals. Moore and Pollack, however, argue that these two analyses should not compete;
instead, &amp;quot;a complete model of discourse structure must maintain both levels of relation&amp;quot;.
In this paper we take this argument one small step further and suggest a way these two levels
might be organized into a stratified structure. Our discussion here has a very narrow focus and does
not attempt to answer such important questions as whether the RST collection of presentational
relations is exhaustive and adequate for describing all possible intentional structures.

2 Analogy with &amp;quot;Meaning&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;Means&amp;quot; in MTT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887692307692">
In Meaning—Text theory (MTT), when there are two (or more) alternative analyses of text which
(according to intution) belong to distinct levels of representation, one should ask whether one of
them can be seen as a means of expressing the other. Moore and Pollack argue for co-existence of
intentional (presentational) and informational (subject matter) analyses, but they do not attempt to
describe the relationship between them. They show that there is no one-to-one mapping between
presentational and subject matter relations, and moreover, that the presentational and subject
matter analyses may have different structures (e.g., the presentational and subject matter relations
may have opposite directionality, [5], pp. 542— 543). Their conclusion is that there is no easy way
to relate these two levels.
From the viewpoint of MTT, however, the intentional vs. informational dichotomy observed by
Moore and Pollack appears quite natural. An analogy can be seen with the relationship between
the semantic and deep syntactic levels in MTT: semantic relations are in a many-to-many corre-
spondence with deep syntactic relations. Moreover, there is no isomorphism or even preservation

of structure between a semantic graph and a deep syntactic tree which expresses it. For example,
on the semantic level, an adverb such as often is typically analyzed as a predicate whose argument
(i.e., dependent) is the remaining sentence graph. On the (deep) syntactic level, the same adverb
is a dependent of the main verb. Thus the direction of dependency can easily change as one passes
from semantics to syntax.
Following this analogy, we propose to consider the informational level of discourse as a means of
expressing the intentional level. Intuitively, this seems quite plausible because informing the hearer
about informational relations between discourse elements can hardly be considered a self-sufficient
goal. Moore and Pollack stress that the intentional level is the primary one since it describes the
speaker&apos;s strategy to achieve her intentional goal.
In keeping with MTT methodology, to give substance to a claim of separate strata, one must
produce a system of rules that map the relations of the &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; level to the relations of the
&amp;quot;means&amp;quot; level. Each &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; relation can map to many &amp;quot;means&amp;quot; relations (or combinations of
such relations) and vice versa, one and the same &amp;quot;means&amp;quot; relation can appear in more than one
mapping rule. Each rule describes the contextual conditions for its application in enough detail to
justify the distinction between various &amp;quot;means&amp;quot;, if such exist.
At the moment, we can give only a few examples of such mapping rules, one of which we present
below. Nevertheless, we present this very preliminary analysis for purposes of discussion, in the
belief that work in discourse representation is crucial for text generation theory and applications.
A stratificational view has significant implications. One of these is to eliminate linear order
from the description of intentional RST relations. Note that in RsT a. given intentional relation
may hold between two text segments appearing in either order provided that appropriate discourse
connectives are used. In our view, linear order and, correspondingly, discourse connectives should
appear only on the informational level. Abstract intentional relations express only the dependencies
between propositions, not the lexical or &amp;quot;syntactic&amp;quot; artifacts associated with the means of their
expression.

3 Example of One-to-Many Mapping

<bodyText confidence="0.946213214285714">
The following example, taken from Moore and Pollack, shows a one-to-many mapping from an
intentional relation to various informational relations.
(la) George Bush supports big business.
(lb) He&apos;s sure to veto House Bill 1711.
In Moore and Pollack&apos;s analysis, (1a) and (1b) are connected by the intentional relation Evi-
dence. In particular, satellite (1a), is given as Evidence, to increase the hearer&apos;s belief in nucleus
(lb). The hearer is assumed to believe (la) or find it credible.
Moore and Pollack show that the same example admits an analysis on the informational level in
terms of the Volitional Cause relation. In our terms, this would mean that the intentional relation
Evidence can be realized by the informational relation Volitional Cause under certain conditions.
If there are other informational relations that are capable of realizing the same intentional relation,
these conditions should clearly identify the application context for each informational relation.
Another informational relation capable of realizing Evidence is Non-Volitional Cause, as
shown in text (2a-2b):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9850455">
(2a) Winters in Montreal are so cold.
(2b) (Therefore,) I need a fur coat (fan; of course).
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.998182">
53
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9418256">
To increase the hearer&apos;s belief in nucleus (21)), the speaker uses satellite (2a) as Evidence. On
the informational level these two propositions are connected by a Non-Volitional Cause relation.
Another example of an informational relation realizing Evidence comes from Mann and Thomp-
son, who admit that some texts can be given analyses in terms of both Evidence and Elaboration
[1]. Consider a modification of (la-lb) above:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989035">
(3a) George Bush definitely supports big business.
(3b) (Look,) He just vetoed House Bill 1711.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.941418333333333">
Here, (3a) is nucleus and (31)) is satellite, given as Evidence to increase the hearer&apos;s belief in
(3a). On the informational level these two propositions can be seen as connected by Elaboration,
where (3b) is a concrete instance of a more general proposition (3a). In contrast, in both examples
1 and 2 the satellite (1a,2a) was a general proposition.
We offer the following sketch of an Intentional-to-informational mapping rule:
If the intentional relation Evidence holds between two propositions
Pi and P2, where PI is a nucleus and P2 is a satellite,
then,
if PI is a general proposition (i.e. the equivalent of a common sense
&amp;quot;law&amp;quot; is given as Evidence),
then
if there is a conscious agent such that both PI and P2 refer to her actions,
then the Volitional Cause informational relation can be chosen;
else (if there is no agent. in Pi and P2 as described above),
then the Non-Volitional Cause informational relation
can be chosen;
if P2 is a general proposition,
then the Elaboration information relation can be chosen.

4 Example of Many-to-One Mapping
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97611625">
Moore and Pollack also give an example of text spans which are in the Condition relation on
the informational level and, depending on the reading, either in the Enablement or Motivation
relation on the intentional level.
(5a) Come home by 5:00.
(51)) Then we can go to the hardware store before it closes.
First reading (Condition/Enablement): the speaker is interested in increasing the hearer&apos;s
ability to perform the action described in (51)). Second reading: the speaker is just interested in
motivating the hearer to do (5a) (because, say, a surprise party is planne(l).
Viewing this example from our perspective, both intentional relations, Enablement and Moti-
vation, can be realized on the informational level by Condition. This is quite analogous to the way
in which an ambiguous sentence may be the common syntactic realization of two distinct semantic
structures. Also, there is no linear order (or then connective) on the intentional level. But there
is a direction of dependency of satellite on nucleus. The directionality of the dependency relation
is preserved in the Enablement/Condition pair, and is reversed in the Motivation/Condition
pair. As noted above, dependency reversal is not surprising when one maps between distinct levels
of description.
