Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999896416666667">
We propose a feature type classification
thought to be used in a therapeutic context.
Such a scenario lays behind our need for a
easily usable and cognitively plausible classi-
fication. Nevertheless, our proposal has both
a practical and a theoretical outcome, and its
applications range from computational lin-
guistics to psycholinguistics. An evaluation
through inter-coder agreement has been per-
formed to highlight the strength of our pro-
posal and to conceive some improvements for
the future.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.990589934782609">
Most common therapeutic practices for anomia
rehabilitation rely either on the therapist’s intui-
tive linguistic knowledge or on different kinds of
resources that have to be consulted manually
(Semenza, 1999; Raymer and Gonzalez-Rothi,
2002; Springer, 2008). STaRS.sys (Semantic
Task Rehabilitation Support system) is a tool
thought for supporting the therapist in the prepa-
ration of a semantic task (cfr. Nickels, 2002).
To be effective, such a system must lean on a
knowledge base in which every concept is asso-
ciated with different kinds of featural descrip-
tions. The notion of feature refers to the linguis-
tic descriptions of a property that can be obtained
by asking a subject to describe a concept. Exam-
ples of concept-feature pairings will be repre-
sented here as &lt;concept&gt; feature 1 couples
such as &lt;dog&gt; has a tail or &lt;dog&gt; barks.
1 Typographical conventions: concepts, categories and fea-
tures will be printed in italics courier new font.
When reporting a concept-feature pair, the concept will be
further enclosed by &lt;angled brackets&gt;. Feature types
and classes of types will be both reported in times roman,
but while the formers will be written in italics, type classes
will be in SMALL CAPITALS.
As a consequence of this scenario, an intuitive
and cognitively plausible classification of the
feature types that can be associated with a con-
cept is a vital component of our tool. In this pa-
per, we present a classification that meets such
criteria, built by moving from an analysis of the
relevant proposals available in the literature.
We evaluated our classification by asking to a
group of naive Italian speakers to annotate a test
set by using our categories. The resulting agree-
ment has been interpreted both as an index of
reliability and as a measure of ease of learning
and use by non-expert speakers. In these prelimi-
nary phases we focus on Italian, leaving to future
evaluations whether or how to extend the domain
of our tool to other languages.
These pages are organized as follows: in Sec-
tion 2 we briefly review the relevant works for
the following discussion. In Section 3 we intro-
duce our classification and in the remaining part
we evaluate its reliability and usability.

2.1 Feature Norms

<bodyText confidence="0.996797647058824">
In the psychological tradition, a collection of fea-
ture norms is typically built by asking to a group
of speakers to generate short phrases (i.e. fea-
tures) to describe a given set of concepts.
Even if normative data have been collected
and employed for addressing a wide range of
issues on the nature of the semantic memory, the
only freely available resources are, to our know-
ledge, those by Garrard et al (2001), those by
McRae et al (2005), those by Vinson and Vig-
liocco (2008), all in English, and the Dutch
norms available in the Leuven database (De
Deyne et al, 2008).
Moving out of the psychological domain, the
only collection built in the lexicographic tradi-
tion is that by Kremer et al (2008), collected
from Italian and German speakers

The proposals that constitute our theoretical
framework have been chosen for their being ei-
ther implemented in an extensive semantic re-
source, motivated by well specified theoretical
explanations (on which there is consensus) or
effectively used in a specific therapeutic context.
They have originated in research fields as distant
as lexicography, theoretical linguistics, ontology
building, (clinical) neuropsychology and cogni-
tive psychology. Specifically, the works we
moved from have been:

3 STaRS.sys feature types classification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.934959878048781">
The properties of our classification follow from
the practical use scenario of STaRS.sys. In de-
tails, the fact that it’s thought to be used in a the-
rapeutic context motivates our need for a classi-
fication that has to be: (1) intuitive enough to be
easily used by therapist and (2) robust and (3)
cognitively plausible so as to be used for prepar-
ing the relevant kinds of therapeutic tasks.
Furthermore, being focused on features pro-
duced by human speakers, the classification ap-
plies to the linguistic description of a property,
rather than to the property itself. Accordingly,
then, pairings like the following:
&lt;plane&gt; carries stuff
&lt;plane&gt; is used for carrying stuff
are though as instances of different types (re-
spectively, is involved in and is used for).
Starting from an analysis of the relevant pro-
posals available in the literature, we identified a
set of 26 feature types, most of which have been
organized into the following six classes:
TAXONOMIC PROPERTIES: Two types related
to the belonging of a concept to a category have
been isolated: the is-a and the coordinate types.
PART-OF RELATIONS: We mainly followed
Winston et al’s (1987) taxonomy in distinguish-
ing six types describing a relation between a
concept and its part(s): has component, has
member, has portion, made-of, has phase and
has geographical part.
PERCEPTUAL PROPERTIES: Inspired by the
Cree and McRae’s (2003) brain region taxono-
my, we isolated six types of perceivable proper-
ties: has size, has shape, has texture, has taste,
has smell, has sound, has colour.
USAGE PROPERTIES: This class is composed
by three types of an object’s use descriptions: is
used for, is used by and is used with.
LOCATIONAL PROPERTIES: We identified
three types describing the typical situation, space
and time associated to an object.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.639853" genericHeader="method">
ASSOCIATED EVENTS AND ATTRIBUTES: This

<bodyText confidence="0.999989275862069">
class encompasses three kinds of information
that can be associated to an object: its emotive
property (has affective property), one of its per-
manent properties (has attribute) and the role it
plays in an action or in a process (is involved in).
As a matter of fact, each of the other classes is a
specification of one of the two latter types, to
which particular relevance has been accorded
due to their status from a cognitive point of view.
Others: Two feature types fall out of this
classification, and constitute two distinct classes
on their own. These are the has domain type, that
specifies the semantic field of a concept, and the
dummy is associated with, used for classifying
all those features that falls out of any other label.
Comparison and final remarks: A quick
comparison between our types and the other
classifications reveals that, apart from the is used
with type, we didn’t introduce any new opposi-
tion. Any type of ours, indeed, has a parallel type
or relation in at least one of the other proposals.
Such a remark shows what is the third major ad-
vantage of our classification, together with its
usability and its cognitive plausibility: its compa-
tibility with a wide range of well known theoreti-
cal and experimental frameworks, that allows it
to serve as a common ground for the interplay of
theories, insights and ideas originated from the
above mentioned research areas.

Given the aims of our classification, and of

coding scheme by asking to a group of non ex-
perts to label a subset of the non-normalized
Kremer et al’s (2008) norms and measuring the

inter-coder agreement between them (Artstein
and Poesio, 2008), adhering to the Krippen-
dorff’s (2004, 2008) recommendations.
The choice to recruit only naive subjects has
the positive consequence of allowing us to draw
inferences also on the usability of our proposal.
That is, such an evaluation can be additionally
seen as a measure of how easily a minimally
trained user can understand the oppositions iso-
lated in our classification.

4.1 Experimental Setup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985433333334">
Participants: 5 Italian speakers with a university
degree were recruited for this evaluation. None
of them had any previous experience in lexico-
graphy, nor any education in lexical semantics.
Materials: 300 concept-feature pairs were se-
lected mainly from a non-normalized version of
the Kremer et al’s (2008) norms. We choose this
dataset because (1) it’s a collection of descrip-
tions generated by Italian speakers and (2) we
wanted to avoid any bias due to a normalization
procedure, so as to provide our subjects with de-
scriptions that were as plausible as possible.
The experimental concept-attribute pairs have
been chosen so to have the more balanced distri-
bution of concepts and feature types as possible,
by not allowing duplicated pairs. As for the con-
cepts, an uniform distribution of features per cat-
egory (30 feature for all the ten categories of the
original dataset) and of features per concept (i.e.
between 4 and 7) has been easily obtained.
The attempt to balance feature types, however,
has revealed impracticable, mainly due to the
nature of the concepts of the Kremer’s collection
and to the skewness of its type distribution.
Therefore, we fixed an arbitrary minimum thre-
shold of ten plausible features per type. Plausible
features have been obtained from a pilot annota-
tion experiment performed by one author and an
additional subject. We further translated 23 con-
cept-feature pairs from the McRae (11 cases) and
from the Leuven (12 cases) datasets for balanc-
ing types as much as possible.
Still, it has not been possible to find ten fea-
tures for the following types: has Geographical
Part, has Phase and has Member (no features at
all: this is a consequence of the kind of concept
represented the dataset), has Portion (only four
cases, again, this is a consequence of the source
dataset), has Domain (5) and has Sound (6). We
nevertheless decided to include these types in the
instructions and the relevant features in the test
set. Our decision has been motivated by the re-
sults of the pilot experiment, in which the sub-
jects made reference to such types as a secondary
interpretation in more than ten cases.
Procedure: The participants were asked to la-
bel every concept-feature pair with the appropri-
ate type label, relying primarily on the linguistic
form of the feature. They received a 17-pages
booklet providing an explanation of the annota-
tion goals, a definition and some examples for
every type class and for every type, a decision
flowchart and a reference table.
Every participant was asked to read carefully
the instructions, to complete a training set of 30
concept-feature pairs and to discuss his/her deci-
sions with one of the two authors before starting
the experimental session. The test set was pre-
sented as a unique excel sheet. On the average,
labeling the 300 experimental pairs took 2 hours.

Even if there is no consensus on how to interp-
ret Kappa values in isolation, and despite the fact
that, to our knowledge, this is the first work of
this kind, we can nevertheless draw interesting
conclusions from the pattern in table 1. The gen-
eral Kappa score has a value of 0.73, and the
agreement values are above 0.8 for 12 types, not
so distant in 2 cases, and well above 0.67 for 9
types, 5 of which are our “residual” categories,
that is, those that are more “general” that at least
one of the other types3.
Such a contrast between the residual and the
other types is even more pronounced in the class-
wise analysis, where the only Kappa value below
the 0.8 threshold is the one obtained for the AS-
SOCIATED EVENTS AND ATTRIBUTES class (κ =
0.766) 4. Furthermore, the distribution of false
positives in a confusion matrix between the per-
formance of the annotators and the “majority”
vote5 shows that part of the low agreement for
the residual types is due to the “summation” of
the disagreement on the other categories. Ob-
viously, part of this variance is due also to the
fact that such types have fuzzier boundaries, and
so are more difficult to handle.
As for the remaining four low agreement
types, two of them (has affective property, has
domain) have been signaled by the annotators to
be difficult to handle, while the remaining two
(has sound, has portion) have been frequently
confused with one of the ASSOCIATED EVENTS
AND ATTRIBUTES types and with the has compo-
nent type, respectively. Such results are not very
puzzling for the has domain and has portion
types, given the technicality of the former and,
for the latter, the nature of the described con-
cepts. They do point, however, to a better defini-
tion of the remaining two types, the has sound
and has affective property ones, in that most dif-
ficulties seem to arise from an unclear definition
of their respective scopes.
As pointed out by Artstein and Poesio (2008),
agreement doesn’t ensure validity. In trying to
evaluate how our annotators “did it right”, we
measured the exact Kappa coefficient (Conger,
1980) between the majority annotation (i.e. what
annotators should have done to agree) and the
annotation of the same set by one of the two au-

thors. With some approximation, we see this last
performance as the “right” one.
Results are reported in the “Kappa: gold / ma-
jority” column of Table 1. The general Kappa
value is well above 0.8, and so it is for 15 of the
23 types. Only two types (has domain and is as-
sociated with) are below the 0.67 minimal thre-
shold. These data further confirm the difficulties
in handling residual types, but, more importantly,
seem to suggest that our “gold standard” annota-
tor have been able to learn the classification in a
fairly correct way (at least, it did in a way similar
as one of the two authors of this classification).

4.3 Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.999993214285714">
We interpret the results of our evaluation as a
demonstration of the reliability of our coding
scheme as well as of the usability of our classifi-
cation, at least as the non residual types are con-
cerned. For the future, many improvements are
suggested by our data. In particular, they showed
the need of the annotators to receive a better
training on some relations and distinctions.
This points in the direction of both a more
deep training on the types we’ve dubbed as “re-
siduals”, and of a better definition of poorly un-
derstood types such as has domain and has affec-
tive property and puzzling distinctions such as
the has smell/is Involved in ones.

5 Conclusions and Future Directions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999718434782609">
In this paper we introduced a classification of the
information types that can be expressed to de-
scribe a concrete concept. Even if we thought
this classification mainly for therapeutic purpos-
es, its use can be broadened to include a wide
range of possible NLP tasks.
We evaluated our proposal by asking a group
of naive speakers to annotate a list of concept-
feature pairs with the appropriate label. Even if
our results can’t be interpreted as absolutely pos-
itive, we consider them promising, in that (1) the
skeleton of the classification seems to have been
validated by the performance of our participants
and (2) a great part of the disagreement seems to
be solvable through major care in the training
phase. In the near future we are going to test our
(improved) coding scheme with annotators from
the population of the STaRS.sys final users, i.e.
therapist with experience in semantic therapy.
Finally, further research is needed to assess if
and to what extent the semantic model underly-
ing our classification is compatible with those of
existing lexical and/or semantic resources.

The choice to recruit only naive subjects has the positive consequence of allowing us to draw inferences also on the usability of our proposal. That is, such an evaluation can be additionally seen as a measure of how easily a minimally trained user can understand the oppositions isolated in our classification. 4.1 Experimental Setup Participants: 5 Italian speakers with a university degree were recruited for this evaluation. None of them had any previous experience in lexicography, nor any education in lexical semantics. Materials:</context>

Even if normative data have been collected and employed for addressing a wide range of issues on the nature of the semantic memory, the only freely available resources are, to our knowledge, those by Garrard et al (2001), those by McRae et al (2005), those by Vinson and Vigliocco (2008), all in English, and the Dutch norms available in the Leuven database (De Deyne et al, 2008). Moving out of the psychological domain, the only collection built in the lexicographic tradition is that by Kremer et al (2008), collected from Italian and German speakers 157 Proceedings of the Fourth Linguistic Annotation Workshop, ACL 2010, pages 157–161, Uppsala, Sweden, 15-16 July 2010. c�2010 Association for Computational Linguistics 2.2 Related Classifications The proposals that constitute our theoretical framework have been chosen for their being either implemented in an extensive semantic re</context>

In details, the fact that it’s thought to be used in a therapeutic context motivates our need for a classification that has to be: (1) intuitive enough to be easily used by therapist and (2) robust and (3) cognitively plausible so as to be used for preparing the relevant kinds of therapeutic tasks. Furthermore, being focused on features produced by human speakers, the classification applies</context>
