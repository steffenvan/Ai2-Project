Cross-lingual projection methods can ben-
efit from resource-rich languages to im-
prove performances of NLP tasks in
resources-scarce languages. However,
these methods confronted the difficulty of
syntactic differences between languages
especially when the pair of languages
varies greatly. To make the projection
method well-generalize to diverse lan-
guages pairs, we enhance the projec-
tion method based on word alignments
by introducing target-language word rep-
resentations as features and proposing a
novel noise removing method based on
these word representations. Experiments
showed that our methods improve the per-
formances greatly on projections between
English and Chinese.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996045">
Most NLP studies focused on limited languages
with large sets of annotated data. English and
Chinese are examples of these resource-rich lan-
guages. Unfortunately, it is impossible to build
sufficient labeled data for all tasks in all lan-
guages. To address NLP tasks in resource-scarce
languages, cross-lingual projection methods were
proposed, which make use of existing resources
in resource-rich language (also called source lan-
guage) to help NLP tasks in resource-scarce lan-
guage (also named as target language).
There are several types of projection methods.
One intuitive and effective method is to build a
common feature space for all languages, so that
the model trained on one language could be di-
rectly used on other languages (McDonald et al.,
2011; T¨ackstr¨om et al., 2012). We call it di-
rect projection, which becomes very popular re-
cently. The main limitation of these methods is
that target language has to be similar to source
language. Otherwise the performance will de-
grade especially when the orders of phrases be-
tween source and target languages differ a lot.
Another common type of projection methods
map labels from resource-rich language sentences
to resource-scarce ones in a parallel corpus us-
ing word alignment information (Yarowsky et al.,
2001; Hwa et al., 2005; Das and Petrov, 2011).
We refer them as projection based on word align-
ments in this paper. Compared to other types of
projection methods, this type of methods is more
robust to syntactic differences between languages
since it trained models on the target side thus fol-
lowing the topology of the target language.
This paper aims to build an accurate projec-
tion method with strong generality to various pairs
of languages, even when the languages are from
different families and are typologically divergent.
As far as we know, only a few works focused
on this topic (Xia and Lewis 2007; T¨ackstr¨om
et al., 2013). We adopted the projection method
based on word alignments since it is less affected
by language differences. However, such methods
also have some disadvantages. Firstly, the models
trained on projected data could only cover words
and cases appeared in the target side of parallel
corpus, making it difficult to generalize to test data
in broader domains. Secondly, the performances
of these methods are limited by the accuracy of
word alignments, especially when words between
two languages are not one-one aligned. So the ob-
tained labeled data contains a lot of noises, making
the models built on them less accurate.
This paper aims to build an accurate projection
method with strong generality to various pairs of
languages. We built the method on top of projec-
tion method based on word alignments because of
its advantage of being less affected by syntactic
differences, and proposed two solutions to solve
the above two difficulties of this type of methods.

Firstly, we introduce Brown clusters of target
language to make the projection models cover
broader cases. Brown clustering is a kind of word
representations, which assigns word with similar
functions to the same cluster. They can be ef-
ficiently learned on large-scale unlabeled data in
target language, which is much easier to acquire
even when the scales of parallel corpora of minor
languages are limited. Brown clusters have been
first introduced to the field of cross-lingual projec-
tions in (T¨ackstr¨om et al., 2012) and have achieved
great improvements on projection between Euro-
pean languages. However, their work was based
on the direct projection methods so that it do not
work very well between languages from different
families as will be shown in Section 3.
Secondly, to reduce the noises in projection, we
propose a noise removing method to detect and
correct noisy projected labels. The method was
also built on Brown clusters, based on the assump-
tion that instances with similar representations of
Brown clusters tend to have similar labels. As far
as we know, no one has done any research on re-
moving noises based on the space of word repre-
sentations in the field of NLP.
Using above techniques, we achieved a projec-
tion method that adapts well on different language
pairs even when the two languages differ enor-
mously. Experiments of NER and POS tagging
projection from English to Chinese proved the ef-
fectiveness of our methods.
In the rest of our paper, Section 2 describes the
proposed cross-lingual projection method. Evalu-
ations are in Section 3. Section 4 gives concluding
remarks.

2 Proposed Cross-lingual Projection
Methods

In this section, we first briefly introduce the cross-
lingual projection method based on word align-
ments. Then we describe how the word represen-
tations (Brown clusters) were used in the projec-
tion method. Section 2.3 describes the noise re-
moving methods.

2.1 Projection based on word alignments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999653863636364">
In this paper we consider cross-lingual projec-
tion based on word alignment, because we want
to build projection methods that can be used be-
tween language pairs with large differences. Fig-
ure 1 shows the procedure of cross-lingual projec-
tion methods, taking projection of NER from En-
glish to Chinese as an example. Here English is
the resource-rich language and Chinese is the tar-
get language. First, sentences from the source side
of the parallel corpus are labeled by an accurate
model in English (e.g., ”Rongji Zhu” and ”Gan
Luo” were labeled as ”PER”), since the source
language has rich resources to build accurate NER
models. Then word alignments are generated from
the parallel corpus and serve as a bridge, so that
unlabeled words in the target language will get the
same labels with words aligning to them in the
source language, e.g. the first word ‘朱(金容)基’
in Chinese gets the projected label ‘PER’, since it
is aligned to “Rongji” and “Zhu”. In this way, la-
bels in source language sentences are projected to
the target sentences.

From the projection procedure we can see that a
labeled dataset of target language is built based on
the projected labels from source sentences. The
projected dataset has a large size, but with a lot
of noises. With this labeled dataset, models of the
target language can be trained in a supervised way.
Then these models can be used to label sentences
in target language. Since the models are trained
on the target language, this projection approach is
less affected by language differences, comparing
with direct projection methods.

target language models are limited by the cover-
age of parallel corpora. For example in Figure 1,
some Chinese politicians in 1990’s will be learned
as person names, but some names of recent politi-
cians such as “Obama”, which did not appeared in
the parallel corpus, would not be recognized.
To broader the coverage of the projected data,
we introduced word representations as features.
Same or similar word representations will be as-
signed to words appearing in similar contexts,
such as person names. Since word representations
are trained on large-scale unlabeled sentences in
target language, they cover much more words than
the parallel corpus does. So the information of a
word in projected labeled data will apply to other
words with the same or similar representations,
even if they did not appear in the parallel data.
In this work we use Brown clusters as word rep-
resentations on target languages. Brown clustering
assigns words to hierarchical clusters according to
the distributions of words before and after them.
Taking NER as an example, the feature template
may contain features shown in Table 1. The cluster
id of the word to predict (c0) and those of context
words (ci, i ∈ {−2, −1, 1, 2}), as well as the con-
junctions of these clusters were used as features in
CRF models in the same way the traditional word
features were used. Since Brown clusters are hi-
erarchical, the cluster for each word can be rep-
resented as a binary string. So we also use prefix
of cluster IDs as features, in order to compensate
for clusters containing small number of words. For
languages lacking of morphological changes, such
as Chinese, there are no pre/suffix or orthography
features. However the cluster features are always
available for any languages.

2.3 Noise Removing in Word Representation
Space
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998277">
Another disadvantage of the projection method is
that the accuracy of projected labels is badly af-
fected by non-literate translation and word align-
ment errors, making the data contain many noises.
For example in Figure 1, the word “Ra(Wu Yi)”
was not labeled as a named entity since it was
not aligned to any words in English due to the
alignment errors. A more accurate model will be
trained if such noises can be reduced.
A direct way to remove the noises is to mod-
ify the label of a word to make it consistent with
the majority of labels assigned to the same word in
the parallel corpus. The method is limited when a
word with low frequency has many of its appear-
ances incorrectly labeled because of alignment er-
rors. In this situation the noises are impossible to
remove according to the word itself. The error in
Figure 1 is an example of this case since the other
few occurrences of the word “Ra(Wu Yi)” also
happened to fail to get the correct label.
Such difficulties can be easily solved when we
turned to the space of Brown clusters, based on
the observation that words in a same cluster tend
to have same labels. For example in Figure 1, the
word “Ra(Wu Yi)”, “朱(金容)基(Zhu Rongji)”
and “罗干(Luo Gan)” are in the same cluster, be-
cause they are all names of Chinese politicians
and usually appear in similar contexts. Having ob-
served that a large portion of words in this cluster
are person names, it is reasonable to modified the
label of “Ra(Wu Yi)” to “PER”.
The space of clusters is also less sparse so it is
also possible to use combination of the clusters to
help noise removing, in order to utilize the context
information of data instances. For example, we
could represent a instance as bigram of the cluster
of target word and that of the previous word. And
it is reasonable that its label should be same with
other instances with the same cluster bigrams.
The whole noise removing method can be rep-
resented as following: Suppose a target word wi
was assigned label yi during projection with prob-
ability of alignment pi. From the whole projected
labeled data, we can get the distribution pw(y) for
the word wi, the distribution pc(y) for its cluster
ci and the distribution pb(y) for the bigram ci−1ci.
We choose y0i = y0, which satisfies

<equation confidence="0.999411">
y0 = argmaxy(δy,yipi + Σx∈{w,c,b}px(y)) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999556">
δy,yi is an indicator function, which is 1 when
y equals to yi. In practices, we set pw/c/b(y) to 0
for the ys that make the probability less than 0.5.
With the noise removing method, we can build a
more accurate labeled dataset based on the pro-
jected data and then use it for training models.

3.1 Data Preparation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995352941176">
We took English as resource-rich language and
used Chinese to imitate resource-scarce lan-
guages, since the two languages differ a lot. We
conducted experiments on projections of NER and
POS tagging. The resource-scarce languages were
assumed to have no training data. For the NER
experiments, we used data from People’s Daily
(April. 1998) as test data (55,177 sentences). The
data was converted following the style of Penn
Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2005). For
evaluation of projection of POS tagging, we used
the test set of CTB. Since English and Chinese
have different annotation standards, labels in the
two languages were converted to the universal
POS tag set (Petrov et al., 2011; Das and Petrov,
2011) so that the labels between the source and tar-
get languages were consistent. The universal tag
set made the task of POS tagging easier since the
fine-grained types are no more cared.
The Brown clusters were trained on Chinese
Wikipedia. The bodies of all articles are retained
to induce 1000 clusters using the algorithm in
(Liang, 2005) . Stanford word segmentor (Tseng
et al., 2005) was used for Chinese word segmenta-
tion. When English Brown clusters were in need,
we trained the word clusters on the tokenized En-
glish Wikipedia.
We chose LDC2003E14 as the parallel corpus,
which contains about 200,000 sentences. GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2000) was used to generate word
alignments. It is easier to obtain similar amount
of parallel sentences between English and minor
languages, making the conclusions more general
for problems of projection in real applications.

Table 2 shows the performances of NER projec-

method with projected clusters in (T¨ackstr¨om et
al., 2012). Although their method was proven to
work well on European language pairs, the results
showed that projection based on word alignments
(WA) worked much better since the source and tar-
get languages are from different families.
After we add the clusters trained on Chinese
Wikipedia as features as in Section 2.2, a great
improvement of about 9 points on the average F1-
score of the three entity types was achieved, show-
ing that the word representation features help to

recall more named entities in the test set. The per-
formances of all three categories of named entities
were improved greatly after adding word repre-
sentation features. Larger improvements were ob-
served on person names (14.4%). One of the rea-
sons for the improvements is that in Chinese, per-
son names are usually single words. Thus Brown-
clustering method can learn good word representa-
tions for those entities. Since in test set, most enti-
ties that are not covered are person names, Brown
clusters helped to increase the recall greatly.
In (T¨ackstr¨om et al., 2012), Brown clusters
trained on the source side were projected to the
target side based on word alignments. Rather than
building a same feature space for both the source
language and the target language as in (T¨ackstr¨om
et al., 2012), we tried to use the projected clus-
ters as features in projection based on word align-
ments. In this way the two methods used exactly
the same resources. In the experiments, we tried
to project clusters trained on English Wikipedia
to Chinese words. They improved the perfor-
mance by about 6.1% and the result was about
20% higher than that achieved by the direct pro-
jection method, showing that even using exactly
the same resources, the proposed method out-
performed that in (T¨ackstr¨om et al., 2012) much
on diverse language pairs.
Next we studied the effects of noise removing
methods. Firstly, we removed noises according to
Eq(1), which yielded another huge improvement
of about 6% against the best results based on clus-
ter features. Moreover, we conducted experiments
to see the effects of each of the three factors. The
results show that both the noise removing methods
based on words and on clusters achieved improve-
ments between 1.5-2 points. The method based on
bigram features got the largest improvement of 3.5
points. It achieved great improvement on person
names. This is because a great proportion of the
vocabulary was made up of person names, some of
which are mixed in clusters with common nouns.

3.3 Performances of POS Projection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989346153846">
In this section we test our method on projection
of POS tagging from English to Chinese, to show
that our methods can well extend to other NLP
tasks. Unlike named entities, POS tags are asso-
ciated with single words. When one target word
is aligned to more than one words with different
POS tags on the source side, it is hard to decide
which POS tag to choose. So we only retained the
data labeled by 1-to-1 alignments, which also con-
tain less noises as pointed out by (Hu et al., 2011).
The same feature template as in the experiments
of NER was used for training POS taggers.
The results are listed in Table 4. Because of the
great differences between English and Chinese,
projection based on word alignments worked bet-
ter than direct projection did. After adding word
cluster features and removing noises, an error re-
duction of 12.7% was achieved.
POS tagging projection can benefit more from
our noise removing methods than NER projection
could, i.e. noise removing gave rise to a higher
improvement (2.7%) than that achieved by adding
cluster features on baseline system (1.5%). One
possible reason is that our noise removing meth-
ods assume that labels are associated with single
words, which is more suitable for POS tagging.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99977575">
In this paper we introduced Brown clusters of
target languages to cross-lingual projection and
proposed methods for removing noises on pro-
jected labels. Experiments showed that both the
two techniques could greatly improve the perfor-
mances and could help the projection method well
generalize to languages differ a lot.
Note that although projection methods based on
word alignments are less affected by syntactic dif-
ferences, the topological differences between lan-
guages still remain an importance reason for the
limitation of performances of cross-lingual projec-
tion. In the future we will try to make use of repre-
sentations of sub-structures to deal with syntactic
differences in more complex tasks such as projec-
tion of dependency parsing. Future improvements
also include combining the direct projection meth-
ods based on joint feature representations with the
proposed method as well as making use of pro-
jected data from multiple languages.

To make the projection method well-generalize to diverse languages pairs, we enhance the projection method based on word alignments by introducing target-language word representations as features and proposing a novel noise removing method based on these word representations. Experiments showed that our methods improve the performances greatly on projections between English and Chinese.</abstract>

Unlike named entities, POS tags are associated with single words. When one target word is aligned to more than one words with different POS tags on the source side, it is hard to decide which POS tag to choose. So we only retained the data labeled by 1-to-1 alignments, which also contain less noises as pointed out by (Hu et al., 2011). The same feature template as in the experiments of NER was used for training POS taggers. The results are listed in Table 4. Because of the great differences between English and Chinese, projection based on word alignments worked better than direct projection did. After adding word cluster features and removing noises, an error reduction of 12.7% was achieved. POS tagging projection can benefit more from our noise removing methods than NER projection could, i.e. noise removing gave rise to a higher improvement (2.7%) than that achieved by adding cluster features on baseline system (1.5%).

Unfortunately, it is impossible to build sufficient labeled data for all tasks in all languages. To address NLP tasks in resource-scarce languages, cross-lingual projection methods were proposed, which make use of existing resources in resource-rich language (also called source language) to help NLP tasks in resource-scarce language (also named as target language). There are several types of projection methods. One intuitive and effective method is to build a common feature space for all languages, so that the model trained on one language could be directly used on other languages (McDonald et al., 2011; T¨ackstr¨om et al., 2012).
