<bodyText confidence="0.999705307692308">
In this paper, an overview of an approach for
cross-language image indexing and multilin-
gual terminology alignment is presented. Con-
tent-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is
proposed as a means to find similar images in
target language documents in the web and
natural language processing is used to reduce
the search space and find the image index. As
the experiments are carried out in specialized
domains, a systematic and recursive use of the
approach is used to align multilingual termi-
nology by creating repositories of images with
their respective cross-language indices.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923642857143">
Images, as representation of real world entities,
constitute a sine qua non prerequisite for a number
of language tasks. For instance, children as well as
foreign language learners often resort to images in
order to concretize lexical learning through asso-
ciative processes (cf. Bloom, 2000: 57).
Likewise, human translators particularly benefit
a lot from images when dealing with specialized
texts. For example, a word-based image search is a
very useful technique to enhance understanding of
the source text and achieve precision in the target
text. In the context of online resources, a site with
the image of a device provides the translator not
only with an illustration of the object, but also with

<bodyText confidence="0.999776484848485">
hyperlinks to websites containing relevant infor-
mation.
However, for an integral usage of images as a
supportive resource for automated language
processes, comprehensive indexed image databases
as well as wide-coverage lists of suitable index
terms are required. The availability of such lists
and the material to index images are language de-
pendent. For instance, for English, considerably
more resources are available than for Spanish. A
study carried out by Burgos (2006) with bilingual
Spanish-English terminological dictionaries re-
vealed that the average of retrieved Spanish docu-
ments per term from the web was dramatically
lower (7,860) than the average of retrieved English
documents (246,575). One explanation to this is
the huge size of the web search space for English
and the little search space for Spanish. However,
another reason is that Spanish terms found in tradi-
tional terminological dictionaries could not be of
conventional usage among experts and do not
represent what is actually contained in the search
space. Therefore, more suitable index terms must
be looked for.
In the present work, content-based image re-
trieval (CBIR) is proposed as a means for multilin-
gual terminology retrieval from the web with the
purpose of aligning a multilingual glossary and
building up an image index. The main goal of this
research is to exploit the co-occurrence of images
and terms in specialized texts which has been
called the bimodal co-occurrence (BC). Experi-
ments have been done so far for English and Span-

The following section provides references on
previous work and suggests that the use of termi-

a bilingual or multilingual setting has not been
discussed in previous literature. Section 3 de-

alignment and includes an outline of the procedure
to select candidate indices through concrete / ab-

temporarily saved and their images analyzed by DORIS.
If an image in the website presents feature values within
a threshold determined by the example image features,
nouns are extracted and classified from the surrounding
text to make up a list of candidate target terms which
could designate the object in the website’s image. Final-
ly, index-image alignment is carried out.

The particular nature of this research where lin-
guistic and visual representations converge to
make up a bimodal co-occurrence which is in-
tended to be exploited for multilingual term re-
trieval from the web requires the support of diverse
specialized knowledge to be applied along the
image-based multilingual term retrieval proposed
here. As a consequence, the required processes will
be framed within or related to the fields and sub-
fields of cross-language information retrieval,
cross-language retrieval from image collections,
image-term alignment, image annotation and con-
tent-based image retrieval.
Many of the latest contributions on the above
mentioned fields have been presented in widely
known events such as the Text Retrieval Confe-
rence (TREC), the Cross-Language Evaluation
Forum (CLEF), the Language Resource Evaluation
Conference (LREC), the Special Interest Group in
Information Retrieval (SIGIR) Conference or the
Symposium on String Processing and Information
Retrieval (SPIRE), among others.

3 BC Hypothesis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945486">
The starting point of this proposal is the BC hypo-
thesis which can be defined as follows.
We assume language independent bimodal co-
occurrence of images and their index terms in the
corpus. This implies that if an image occurs in a
document of the corpus, the corresponding index
term will also occur in the same document (see
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.88655">
Figure 2).
Figure 2. Representation of the BC-hypothesis
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.953507642857143">
Figure 2 also suggests the BC in a bilingual set-
ting. That is, when there is an image of an object in
the source language corpus along with its index
term there should also be an image of the same
object along with its index term in the target lan-
guage corpus. This means that matching both im-
ages would get the two equivalent terms closer.
Table 1 shows an example of the bilingual setting
of the BC. Both bimodal pairs (image and term)
were extracted from manually tracked websites. It
is an example of two manually matched images
taken from two different language websites which
also serve to illustrate how cross-language equiva-
lences between index terms can be established.

<bodyText confidence="0.999912357142857">
In order to prove this BC assumption with some
more representative data, a preliminary empirical
study (carried out initially for English) was carried
out. A sub-corpus of 20 noun phrases6 designating
concrete entities from the automotive industry was
extracted from an issue of the Automotive Engi-
neering International Online7 journal’s Tech Briefs
section and used to retrieve documents from the
web. The first 10 results (i.e., web pages) for each
term were stored. Each of the web pages was ma-
nually analyzed to check the BC. The result was
that the 20 terms confirmed the BC-hypothesis in
145 sites (out of 200) which means a 72.5% of
positive cases.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.913375818181818">
In order to make the most of the BC, it is necessary
to automate the process of image matching and
image indexing. The fact of matching two images
coming from different language documents gene-
rates comparable corpora (i.e., topic related) and
increases the probability of aligning two equivalent
terms by reducing the search space. To do so, we
use DORIS, a Domain-ORiented Image Searcher
(Jaramillo and Branch, 2009a). DORIS is a JAVA
application to retrieve visual information which
uses both geometric and Zernike moments based
on texture and shape information contained in im-
ages. DORIS performance reaches a 90% of preci-
sion (Jaramillo and Branch, 2009b).
For the image indexing, we first start from a
source language indexed image. An internet seg-
ment in the target language is delimited as the
search space whose images are compared with the
source language image using DORIS. When a

positive image matching occurs, the target lan-
guage document containing the matched image is
marked as a potential location of the target lan-
guage index term.
Given that more noise results from a large
search space, the size of the image database is
usually one of the major concerns in CBIR applica-
tions. In our work, we observed that the first prob-
lem to tackle is the appropriate definition of the
web segment that will constitute the search space.
Therefore, scalability and quality issues will be
initially addressed by systematically predefining
the websites which could contain the image and
therefore the target term. In this regard, and as a
starting point, the Open Directory Project8 is used
to define our search space. This way, not only cat-
egories but also languages can be filtered. For ex-
ample, the url
http://www.dmoz.org/Business/Automotive/ leads
to the automotive category which contains subca-
tegories and sites in English. On the other hand,
following the url
http://www.dmoz.org/World/Español/Negocios/Ind
ustrias/Automotriz/ which specifies the language,
the user finds subcategories and sites of the catego-
ry automotriz for Spanish.
The image database size and quality will depend
on this definition. Uniformity is more likely, for
example, within the photographs of the same site
than between the images of two or more sites.
Likewise, there will be greater variance of image
characteristics between the images of two different
domains than within the images of the same do-
main, and so on.
Current results were achieved using DORIS.
The observations made so far with respect to
matching of images on the web suggest that some
positive matches in rather homogeneous search
spaces provided enough target index term locations
to pursue index candidate selection.

As it has been suggested, BC can be used for mo-

has been decided and the target image has been
located as described in the previous section, the
index candidate selection can be carried out but,
before, it is possible to reduce even more the

search space for the index term location by parsing
the text surrounding the target image and extract-
ing the noun phrases (NP).
We distinguish NPs from other sort of phrases
by means of a chunker. Once all NPs have been
extracted, some normalization is done in order to
optimize the coming noun classification stage. The
cleaning consists of removing determiners at the
beginning of the phrase; lemmatization (if appro-
priate); discarding NPs whose head noun is an
acronym9; splitting Saxon possessives, and delet-
ing proper nouns and numbers:
three development objectives --&gt; development objective
FSE’s single direct injector --&gt; single direct injector
Given the nature of the association, we are fo-
cusing, that is image-term alignment, the list of
remaining NPs can be additionally pruned by clas-
sifying nouns intro concrete and abstract10.
Classifying nouns as denoting an abstractum or
a concretum is not a trivial task and cannot be
widely covered in this paper because of the limited
space. It can be said, however, that for noun classi-
fication, some approaches have been considered
here. For example, remarkable contributions were
made particularly by Bullinaria (2008), Katrenko
and Adriaans (2008), Peirsman et al. (2008),
Shaoul and Westbury (2008), Van de Cruys (2008)
and Versley (2008). They use word space and syn-
tactic models which, in some cases, behave very
well.
As for the present study experimentation con-
cerning noun classification, three approaches were
tested. The number one used non-linguistic va-
riables, the number two was based on syntactic
patterns and the number three used lexical seman-
tics information taken from WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998). The automatic semantic annotation was
done by the SuperSenseTagger (Ciaramita, 2006).
In fact, it is the latter approach the one that yielded
the best results with a precision of 88.6% (for de-
tailed information, see Burgos, 2009).

the work since often do not reveal whether they designate
concrete or abstract entities – which could hinder further

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914227272727">
With a 90% of precision in image matching and an
88.6% of precision in the noun classification task,
we assume a high probability of having the right
image with a reduced list of index candidates.
Now, the indexing process can be simplified if
the image file name matches any of the candidates.
For cases where such matching does not occur, the
following procedure is proposed.
For indexing the target image, each candidate is
used to query the image database (e.g., Google) for
images. For each candidate, the 20 first retrieved
images are compared with the target image using
DORIS. When a positive image match occurs, the
original image is indexed with the candidate that
was used to retrieve from the web the image that
yielded the positive image match. Table 4 illu-
strates this procedure by an example. In the exam-
ple, the images retrieved by steering wheel and air
filter did not match with the original image, but
one of the images retrieved by cylinder head did.
Therefore, the original image is indexed as cylind-
er head.

The approach shows that image indices can be
assigned taking into account usage, specificity and
geographical variants. The fact of indexing the
image with a term retrieved from its context as-
sures that the index term is being used. Moreover,
this technique tries to retrieve the appropriate de-
gree of specificity that the index of a specific do-
main image is expected to present – which is often
determined by the number of modifiers of multi-
word expressions. Likewise, even for specialized
discourse, indices should respond to geographical
variants. This aspect can be controlled by specify-
ing country domains.

6 Appeals and needs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997290625">
This work could be incorporated with projects
dealing with the access to existing information
bases by providing multilingual and multimodal
extensions to them. For instance, assistive technol-
ogy databases (e.g. EASTIN) or patent retrieval
engines (cf. Codina et al., 2008) which contain a
great deal of visual content.
Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is an
important contribution to multimodal information
retrieval. In addition, pairing images with equiva-
lent multilingual terminology has become a matter
of interest, particularly in specialized domains.
This work could integrate CBIR and natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) techniques so that images
can be used as language independent representa-
tions to help in finding documents of textual or
ontology descriptions.
Our approach can be especially useful for web
users who do not know the structure of the classifi-
cation system to successfully search or when they
do not know the language and special terminology
of the information base.
Thus, this work can be integrated to other sys-
tems in order to provide cross-lingual retrieval and
machine translation for both queries and docu-
ments and to enable visualization support for query
formulation and document content presentation.
Given the nature of this research’s products,
they can be included into the scope of multilingual-
ity by combining CBIR and cross-language infor-
mation retrieval technology. A link to
terminological databases can also be established so

they can be automatically fed with entries and vis-
ual content.
As for this research needs, an adaptation of the
SST to Spanish would be really valuable. The SST
has already been ported to Italian which represents
an interesting experience to take into account.
On the other hand, optimization and integration
of the research modules such as a web crawler and
an interface for CBIR and noun classification are
still pending.

<bodyText confidence="0.999976772727273">
Given that not all process stages of the proposal
presented in this paper have been completely inte-
grated and automated, an overall evaluation has not
been possible so far. Future work aims at integrat-
ing DORIS in modules for index candidate selec-
tion and index-image alignment. The goal is to be
able to compile multilingual specialized glossaries
after systematic and recursive exploration of well
delimited web segments and storage of images
with their respective cross-language indices. Like-
wise, some other methods to improve discrimina-
tion between concrete and abstract nouns will be
researched. The above cited related works in this
line have not been tested yet for our proposal, but,
for future work, they will be taken into account
provided that these models rely on local informa-
tion and it certainly represents an advantage for
this specific task11. Even if linguistic specific fea-
tures are hard to find in both classes of nouns, they
are not completely discarded. Finally, further expe-
riments will be carried out with other domains than
automotive engineering.

<abstract confidence="0.999774071428572">In this paper, an overview of an approach for cross-language image indexing and multilingual terminology alignment is presented. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is proposed as a means to find similar images in target language documents in the web and natural language processing is used to reduce the search space and find the image index. As the experiments are carried out in specialized domains, a systematic and recursive use of the approach is used to align multilingual terminology by creating repositories of images with their respective cross-language indices.</abstract>

We assume language independent bimodal cooccurrence of images and their index terms in the corpus. This implies that if an image occurs in a document of the corpus, the corresponding index term will also occur in the same document (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Representation of the BC-hypothesis Figure 2 also suggests the BC in a bilingual setting. That is, when there is an image of an object in the source language corpus along with its index term there </context>

As the experiments are carried out in specialized domains, a systematic and recursive use of the approach is used to align multilingual terminology by creating repositories of images with their respective cross-language indices. 1 Introduction Images, as representation of real world entities, constitute a sine qua non prerequisite for a number of language tasks. For instance, children as well as foreign language learners often resort to images in order to concretize lexical learning through associative processes (cf. Bloom, 2000: 57). Likewise, human translators particularly benefit a lot from images when dealing with specialized texts. For example, a word-based image search is a very useful technique to enhance understanding of the source text and achieve precision in the target text. In the context of online resources, a site with the image of a device provides the translator not only with an illustration of the object, but also with 76 hyperlinks to websites containing relevant information. However, for an integral usage of images as a supportive resource for automated language processes, comprehensive indexed ima</context>

DORIS is a JAVA application to retrieve visual information which uses both geometric and Zernike moments based on texture and shape information contained in images. DORIS performance reaches a 90% of precision (Jaramillo and Branch, 2009b). For the image indexing, we first start from a source language indexed image. An internet segment in the target language is delimited as the search space whose images are compared with the source language image using DORIS. When a 6 See (Quirk et al., 1985: 247) or (Bosque, 1999: 8-28, 45-51) with respect to the interpretation of the concept ‘concrete noun’. 7 Cf. http://www.sae.org/automag/, state January, 2006.

Given that more noise results from a large search space, the size of the image database is usually one of the major concerns in CBIR applications.

(2008), Shaoul and Westbury (2008), Van de Cruys (2008) and Versley (2008). They use word space and syntactic models which, in some cases, behave very well. As for the present study experimentation concerning noun classification, three approaches were tested. The number one used non-linguistic variables, the number two was based on syntactic patterns and the number three used lexical semantics information taken from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). The automatic semantic annotation was done by the SuperSenseTagger (Ciaramita, 2006). In fact, it is the l</context>

(2004). 3 BC Hypothesis The starting point of this proposal is the BC hypothesis which can be defined as follows. We assume language independent bimodal cooccurrence of images and their index terms in the corpus. This implies that if an image occurs in a document of the corpus, the corresponding index term will also occur in the same document (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Representation of the BC-hypothesis Figure 2 also suggests the BC in a bilingual setting. That is, when there is an im</context>

However, for an integral usage of images as a supportive resource for automated language processes, comprehensive indexed image databases as well as wide-coverage lists of suitable index terms are required. The availability of such lists and the material to index images are language dependent. For instance, for English, considerably more resources are available than for Spanish. A study carried out by Burgos (2006) with bilingual Spanish-English terminological dictionaries revealed that the average of retrieved Spanish documents per term from the web was dramatically lower (7,860) than the average of retrieved English documents (246,575). One explanation to this is the huge size of the web search space for English and the little search space for Spanish. However, another reason is that Spanish terms found in traditional terminological dictionaries could not be of conventional usage among experts and do not represent what is actually contained in the search space. Therefore, more suitable index terms mus</context>

Likewise, even for specialized discourse, indices should respond to geographical variants. This aspect can be controlled by specifying country domains. 6 Appeals and needs This work could be incorporated with projects dealing with the access to existing information bases by providing multilingual and multimodal extensions to them. For instance, assistive technology databases (e.g. EASTIN) or patent retrieval engines (cf. Codina et al., 2008) which contain a great deal of visual content. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is an important contribution to multimodal information retrieval. In addition, pairing images with equivalent multilingual terminology has become a matter of interest, particularly in specialized domains. This work could integrate CBIR and natural language processing (NLP) techniques so that images can be used as language independent representations to help in finding documents of textual or ontology descriptions. Our approach can be especially useful for web users who do not know the structure of the classific</context>

We assume language independent bimodal cooccurrence of images and their index terms in the corpus. This implies that if an image occurs in a document of the corpus, the corresponding index term will also occur in the same document (see Figure 2). Figure 2.

As for the present study experimentation concerning noun classification, three approaches were tested. The number one used non-linguistic variables, the number two was based on syntactic patterns and the number three used lexical semantics information taken from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). The automatic semantic annotation was done by the SuperSenseTagger (Ciaramita, 2006). In fact, it is the latter approach the one that yielded the best results with a precision of 88.6% (for detailed information, see Burgos, 2009). 9 NPs with acronyms as HN are not included at this stage of the work since often do not reveal whether they designate concrete or abstract entities – which could hinder further validation. 10 The experiments in this stage so far have been done for English. 79 Concrete Abstract No No annota- anation lysis Concrete 81 14 1 4 Abstract 8 90 0 2 Table 2.

To do so, we use DORIS, a Domain-ORiented Image Searcher (Jaramillo and Branch, 2009a). DORIS is a JAVA application to retrieve visual information which uses both geometric and Zernike moments based on texture and shape information contained in images. DORIS performance reaches a 90% of precision (Jaramillo and Branch, 2009b). For the image indexing, we first start from a source language indexed image. An internet segment in the target language is delimited as the search space whose images are compared with the source language image using DORIS.

Finally, some image-term alignment work has been presented in Burgos and Wanner (2006), Declerck and Alcantara (2006); Li and Wang (2003); Barnard and Forsyth (2001); Pastra (2006) and Wang et al. (2004). 3 BC Hypothesis The starting point of this proposal is the BC hypothesis which can be defined as follows. We assume language independent bimodal cooccurrence of images and their index terms in the corpus. This implies that if an image occurs in a document of the corpus, the corresponding index term will also occur in the same document (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Representation of the BC-hypothesis Figure 2 also suggests the BC in a bilingual setting. That is, when there is an image of an object in the source language corpus along with its index term there should also be an image of the same ob</context>
