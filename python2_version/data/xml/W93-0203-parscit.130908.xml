Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9903345">
Instructional texts are designed by an Originator (0) to enable a User (U) to perform a task
safely, efficiently, and correctly. The starting point for the construction of such a text is a. set
of underlying intentions relating to the actions that U is intended to perform. This needs to be
expressed in the text in a grammatical and pragmatically effective way. Analysis of multilingual
texts, however, indicates that what is pragmatically effective in one language may not be what is
preferred in another. Our research has concentrated on the task of delineating which parts of the
text production process are open to this sort of variation, and which parts follow directly from
the task structure that is the shared representation for all the languages. The multilingual data,
has enabled its to tease out six levels of representation a.t which variability can and does arise.
This makes the picture, for instruction generation at, least, rather more complex than any simple
mapping between task structure and discourse structure can hope to approximate.
What are the levels it is useful to distinguish? We suggest they are as follows:
The knowledge of the artefact A functional model of the artefact and its mode of operation
in terms of actions and states;
The deep intentions The represention of the originator&apos;s intention that the user perform the
sequence of actions that constitute a. particular task involving the artefact;
The knowledge selected for communication What is to be communicated about the artefact
and the task that will enable the users to perform the appropriate actions, based on assump-
tions about their cultural background, world knowledge, and expertise;
The shallow intentions A representation of the goals that the text has to achieve in order to
motivate the required tasks;
The rhetorical structure The discourse strategy/ies chosen to achieve the text&apos;s goals; and

The syntactic structure The syntax expressing the chosen rhetorical structure.
We focus here on three of the above levels: deep intentions, shallow intentions and rhetorical struc-
ture, and we will present evidence from multilingual instructions that supports this differentiation
of levels of description by highlighting the variability that exists between them. It is clear that,
whatever the principles are for relating them, the mapping from one level to another is not a simple
one-to-one correspondence. But why suggest two levels of intentions, and what are they like?

Two Levels of Intentions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999578">
Every set of instructions is the realisation of a programme of actions that the user is required
to perform: the deep intentions of the originator. In multilingual document generation, this
programme is necessarily independent of the language(s) in which the instructions are expressed.
Intentions at this level do not specify linguistic acts to be perfornicql; rather, they are intentions
for the user to perform concrete actions. Intentions at this level might therefore be represented as
hierarchically- organised sequences of statements like in1.em/8(0 , do( (1, actioni)).
This level of action requirements often does not map directly onto the final text, and may not even
be expressed explicitly in it. It does not correspond to a. text plan; rather, it is the action plan
which motivates the text aud as such is but one of several available resources for the text planner.
For example, instructions which include all the actions required to achieve a goal, even those which
the user reasonably could be expected to infer, are not usually desirable (see di Eugenio [1992]).
This level of intentions relates almost directly to that presented by Grosz and Sidner [1986:201] in
their discussion of what they term the action casc. The main difference between our deep intentions
and those that form Grosz and Sidner&apos;s discourse purposes ON and discourse segment puzposes
(DsPs) is that we have so far found it sufficient for our purposes to include at this level only the
originator&apos;s intentions with respect to user actions, and not user beliefs.
In producing instructions the originator also has other intentions, which relate to the way(s) in
which he/she will convey the action requirements to the user. This leads us to propose a second
level of intentionality, that of shallow intentions, where the particular functions to be fulfilled by
the discourse are specified.
Consider the following simple scenario where the intention of the originator is for the user of an
electronic organiser to turn on the machine by pressing the ON button. The deep intentions would
thus be as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.7438385">
(1) intends(0 , do(U , turnonmachin(: ))
intends(0 , do(U, press0 N button))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995566">
The intention for the user to turn on the machine is at a. higher level in the intentional structure
than the intention for the user to press the button (This might be captured, using Grosz and
Sidner&apos;s terms, as a DOMINATES relation holding between the higher and lower intentions).
The originator of the instruction may feel that it is sufficient simply to instruct the user to turn cm
the machine, or to press the ON button. This would lead to a shallow intention corresponding to:

<listItem confidence="0.866938">
(2) intends(0 , in f ni,(O, U, (io(U,tumonmachine)))
in the case of the former, and
(3) intends(0 , in f orm(0 , U, do(U , press° N button)))
The information that originators choose to convey in instructions, however, is not always this
basic: users are not simply told what to do. Good instructions allow the user to develop a fuller
understanding of what they are doing through the provision of information such as the relationship
between the required actions and their expected effects. Deep intentions may thus lead to other
possible shallow intentions such as the following:
(4) intends(0 , in! orm(0 , U, why — to(press0 N button)))
(5) intends(0 , in f orm(0 U, how — to(turnonnutehine)))
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999392666666667">
The choice of final expression (including the choice of coherence relation) will bear a direct relation
to choices at the level of shallow intentions, and not deep intention. In the following multilingual
instructions (taken from an instruction manual for a home exercise stepping machine) the deep
intention is the same: that the user balance the apparatus by turning the milled wheel. However,
the shallow intentions chosen for the different languages are not the sante: in the English and
German versions, the user is told how to balance the apparatus, while the French user is told
why the milled wheel needs to be turned. These differing shallow intentions directly constrain the
choice of coherence relation: an analysis in terms of RST, for example, would lead us to assign
ENABLEMENT to the German and English versions, but PURPOSE to the French:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9503575">
(6) The apparatus can be balanced on uneven floors by turning the milled
wheel.
(7) Durch Drehen der Randelmutter kann (las Gerat unebellen Boden-
verhaltnissen angeglichen werden.&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;By turning of the milled wheel can the apparatus (to) uneven floor conditions
adapted become.

&apos;Turn the milled wheel to adapt the apparatus to the uneveniMss of the floor.

<bodyText confidence="0.999700125">
Note, too, that there is more than one possible surface formulation of each coherence relation:
the expression chosen by the originator in each of the above examples is but one of a range of
possibilities*.
Moore and Pollack [1992] propose the need for two levels of RST relations, one relating to intentions
(e.g. EVIDENCE) and the other to information (e.g. CON DITION ). Although this suggestion clearly
takes its closer to a solution to the lack of delicacy in the characterisation of RST relations, we
should be careful to agree on a useful nomenclature that does not itself permit new confusions to
arise. We hope that the workshop will provide an opportunity for clarifying these issues.

Summary and Implications

<bodyText confidence="0.99999475">
We suggest these six levels of representation to reflect what we have observed in the analysis of
multilingual instructions. At the basic level, parallel instructional texts are in some sense &apos;the
same&apos;, in that they are intended to achieve the same effect—i.e., these texts are CONGRU ENT at
the level of deep intentions. However, this level alone is not sufficient to account for the observed
variability between congruent texts. For example, we would expect the same rhetorical relation
to be chosen in each language for a given deep intention, and as we have shown, this is not the
case. What underpins the choice of rhetorical relation (among other pragmatic constraints) is the
intermediate level of shallow intentions: the rhetorical goals selected for the actual text. Coherence
relations are chosen to support these shallow intentions. The corollary of this is that any analysis
of the coherence relations present, in a text will not reveal the deep intentions underlying that text
(its &apos;message&apos;, so to speak), since the levels of variability we have described here do not allow such
a straightforward mapping.
The multilingual data. prevents this a.ssumption that. the mappings between these levels are simple,
since it shows how much variability there may be between one level of representation and the next
for different languages. However, it should not be assumed that the six levels we propose are strictly
serially ordered in terms of deciding how to present a text in a. givc.‘n language. As in ally process
related to language production, a decision at one level may be influenced by facts several levels
above or below.
With respect to the translation of instructional texts, it seems clear to us that the interface between
shallow intentions and discourse relations plays a critical role in determining the naturalness and
appropriateness of the target text. It is highly likely that the nature of the variation occurring at
this level is language-dependent, with the result. that the decisions taken in the production of the
source text may not be appropriate for the target. As far as we know, this level of representation
is not exploited in current MT systems.
Our data suggest that capturing the variability between congruent texts is a. rich area for inves-
tigation, and one that sheds light on the levels of intention and rhetoric that underpin discourse.
We suggest that such a study not only points to advances in theory, but to advances in MT and
M-NLG in the production of pragmatically appropriate instructional texts.
