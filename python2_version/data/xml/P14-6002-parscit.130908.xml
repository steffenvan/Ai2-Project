Much of NLP tries to map structured input (sen-
tences) to some form of structured output (tag se-
quences, parse trees, semantic graphs, or trans-
lated/paraphrased/compressed sentences). Thus
structured prediction and its learning algorithm
are of central importance to us NLP researchers.
However, when applying machine learning to
structured domains, we often face scalability is-
sues for two reasons:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.943157666666667">
1. Even the fastest exact search algorithms for
most NLP problems (such as parsing and
translation) is too slow for repeated use on the
training data, but approximate search (such
as beam search) unfortunately breaks down
the nice theoretical properties (such as con-
vergence) of existing machine learning algo-
rithms.
2. Even with inexact search, the scale of the
training data in NLP still makes pure online
learning (such as perceptron and MIRA) too
slow on a single CPU.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998188">
This tutorial reviews recent advances that ad-
dress these two challenges. In particular, we will
cover principled machine learning methods that
are designed to work under vastly inexact search,
and parallelization algorithms that speed up learn-
ing on multiple CPUs. We will also extend struc-
tured learning to the latent variable setting, where
in many NLP applications such as translation and
semantic parsing the gold-standard derivation is
hidden.

Liang Huang is an Assistant Professor at the City
University of New York (CUNY). He received
his Ph.D. in 2008 from Penn and has worked
as a Research Scientist at Google and a Re-
search Assistant Professor at USC/ISI. His work
is mainly on the theoretical aspects (algorithms
and formalisms) of computational linguistics, as
well as theory and algorithms of structured learn-
ing. He has received a Best Paper Award at ACL
2008, several best paper nominations (ACL 2007,
EMNLP 2008, and ACL 2010), two Google Fac-
ulty Research Awards (2010 and 2013), and a Uni-
versity Graduate Teaching Prize at Penn (2005).
He has given two tutorials at COLING 2008 and
NAACL 2009, being the most popular tutorial at
both venues.
Kai Zhao is a Ph.D. candidate at the City Univer-
sity of New York (CUNY), working with Liang
Huang. He received his B.S. from the Univer-
sity of Science and Technology in China (USTC).
He has published on structured prediction, online
learning, machine translation, and parsing algo-
rithms. He was a summer intern with IBM TJ Wat-
son Research Center in 2013.
Lemao Liu is a postdoctoral research associate at
the City University of New York (CUNY), work-
ing with Liang Huang. He received his Ph.D. from
the Harbin Institute of Technology in 2013. Much
of his Ph.D. work was done while visiting NICT,
Japan, under Taro Watanabe. His research area is
machine translation and machine learning.
