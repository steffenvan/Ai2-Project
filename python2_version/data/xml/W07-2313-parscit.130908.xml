In this paper we introduce a method for generat-
ing interactive documents which exploits the visual
features of hypertext to represent discourse struc-
ture. We explore the consistent and principled use
of graphics and animation to support navigation and
comprehension of non-linear text, where textual dis-

There is a long and well-established literature with-
in theoretical, computational and psycho-linguistics
on textual devices that function to signal the coher-
ence structure of a discourse to the reader. This
work has addressed the traditional conceptualisa-
tion of text: a two-dimensional array on a physical
page, traversed in a set pattern (e.g., left to right,
top to bottom in the Western tradition). As texts
are increasingly being read on a computer screen,
the act of reading is progressively becoming one of
hypertext navigation. However, hypertext presents
a strikingly different conceptualisation of text, and
brings with it new challenges for conveying dis-
course structure.
Hypertext is distinctive in that it is interactive
and non-linear, with several reading paths available
through the document. It is organised around nodes
and links; the reader moves from node to node by
mouse-clicking on links. A node can be the equiv-
alent of a traditional text page or can contain just a
few sentences; links can be words or graphical ele-
ments. Since nodes typically contain more than one
link, the author can only partially control the order
in which the reader will access them.
With hypertext, then, a new conceptualisation of
text has emerged as a three-dimensional array on
a computer screen, which can be traversed in any
number of ways. One of the challenges this poses
for text research is that coherence markers of the tra-
ditional notion of text often do not work for this new
medium. We are exploring new possibilities for sig-
nalling coherence in non-linear documents, exploit-
ing the graphical features of a visually rich medium
yet to be systematically exploited as a dimension
of signification. This work is set in the context of
the textual presentation of medical records from a
repository of data-encoded medical histories.

As we discuss elsewhere (Mancini et al., 2007), dis-
course markers such as adverbials, pronouns and
connectives cannot reliably be used to signal the
discourse relation between hypertext nodes, since
nodes can be accessible in more than one way, via
paths that reflect different relevancies. This restric-
tion is less likely to apply to graphical features, be-
cause they are visual and work in space. Owing
to its technical characteristics, hypertext is a spatial
medium (Carter, 2000) as well as a temporal one
(Luesebrink, 1998), in which spatial structures have
a temporal dimension and realisation: both space
and time can be exploited in hypertext to express
discourse coherence through space-temporal con-
figurations in a three-dimensional space.
At present, most hypertexts (especially on the
Web) make no use of graphical features to signal
discourse relations between nodes, and nodes often
consist of long text pages with a few links target-
ing other pages, from where the source page can
no longer be seen. We take a different approach
whereby the text is made more readable in two
ways: by making hypertext nodes much smaller and
by using graphical features to signal the coherence
relations between nodes. We use the screen as a
visual field across which the text can dynamically
distribute, as links are clicked and new nodes ap-
pear, composing meaningful patterns. The presen-

tation and distribution of the nodes are intended to
signify the rhetorical role that their content plays
within the discourse. To achieve this, coherence
relations are used as document structuring princi-
ples during discourse construction to define hyper-
text links. These are then dynamically rendered
during navigation through the consistent and con-
current use of the medium’s spatial and temporal
graphic features connoting the nodes. We refer to
this paradigm as cinehypertext.
Having established a parallel between textual and
visual processing, research informed by Gestalt the-
ory has proposed relevant principles of document
design (Campbell, 1995; Riley and Parker, 1998).
Additionally, a number of representational rules for
visually expressing discourse relations between hy-
pertext nodes can be derived from the semiology of
graphics, according to which graphic features can
be employed to express conceptual relationships of
similarity, difference, order and proportion, exploit-
ing the properties of the visual image (Koch, 2001).
Following these principles and rules, we have de-
signed and begun testing a series of prototype vi-
sual patterns expressing coherence relations in non-
linear discourse (Mancini et al., 2007).
3 Graphics devices to visualise interactive
text structure
Our empirical work so far shows that graphics can
indeed be used to express abstract relational con-
cepts (Power et al., 2003; Mancini, 2005). But
can graphics usefully support the expression of dis-
course structure in hypertext navigation? Can visual
discourse markers support comprehension, substi-
tuting or complementing textual discourse markers
in non-linear documents? If so, how do these tex-
tual and graphical features interact: can they express
the same semantic meaning by following the same
principles or do they, due to their different semi-
otic characteristics, function in different ways to the
same end?
Our starting point is two NLG systems that gen-
erate, as linear text, summaries of a cancer patient’s
medical history (respectively generated to be read
by clinicians and medical researchers, or by pa-
tients) from a repository of data-encoded medical
reports (Hallett et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2007).
We are extending these systems to generate interac-
tive text on the one hand, and its animated graphical
presentation, on the other. Since textual and graph-
ical discourse markers will interact with each other,
You had a consultation with your doctor on September 20th 1993.
On September 27th you did a self examination and you found that
you had a lump in your right breast. A self examination is an
examination of the breasts by running your hand over each breast
and up under your arms and checking for changes to their size,
shape or feel.
On October 4th you did another self examination and you found that
you had a lump in your right breast.
On October 11th you had a radical mastectomy to treat cancer in
your right breast. A radical mastectomy is an operation to remove
the breast, along with the lymph glands under the arm and the
muscles of the chest wall. Cancer is a tumour that tends to spread,
both locally and to other parts of the body.

our interactive documents may not present some of
the textual features that occur in the corresponding
linear form. We aim to provide a principled account
of this interaction, and start by studying the effect
of using visual markers on an interactive version of
the linear reports already produced by our genera-
tors. Figure 1 shows an example section of a linear
textual report.
At present, we transform a linear medical report
into an interactive one by dividing the text into re-
lated chunks within text nodes whose graphics and
animation features signal the relations holding be-
tween the chunks. In our example, the relations
holding between the nodes are SEQUENCE, ELAB-
ORATION, MOTIVATION and RESULT. We gener-
ate graphical presentations of these discourse rela-
tions, using motion trajectory, distribution, colour
value and dimensions of text windows. Red arrows
and bold fonts in the windows signal active links,
whereas followed links are signalled by dark grey
arrows and bold fonts.
Specifically, the SEQUENCE of events described
in the report is expressed by the vertical alignment
of text windows appearing one under the other and
having the same width and background colour (Fig-
ure 2).
Causal relations, like RESULT and MOTIVATION,
holding between events are expressed by the hori-
zontal alignment of text windows having the same
height, where the one representing the result slides
out, moving from left to right, from behind the one
representing the cause, having a darker background
(Figure 3)
The expression of MOTIVATION is similar to that
of RESULT, with the difference that this time the
window representing the motivation moves from

Finally, the definitions for which an explanation
is available constitute links whose activation trig-
gers an ELABORATION node, which appears slightly
overlapped along a virtual third dimension. While
the background of the other nodes is grey, the back-
ground of elaborative nodes is a lighter tone of red
(Figure 5).
We have been evaluating the significance of these
and other visual patterns, while exploring new de-
signs to express discourse relations in interactive
documents of different formats. We are also imple-
menting a prototype system that employs a selection
of patterns to carry out more empirical studies. The
architecture of the prototype is described below.

we are crossing the border from document genera-
tion to application generation because the user inter-
acts with a Rich Internet Application (RIA) which is
very much data-driven.
Our XCH format is an instance of XML defined by
two XML schema files. One is domain-independent
and captures the range of semantic/pragmatic rela-
tions that can be encoded between chunks of infor-
mation. The other is domain-specific and defines
the document structure of (in the current prototype)
a medical report.
Often, XML is processed using XSLT. Indeed
a simple XSLT style sheet can be used to convert
XCH to linear text. However, to transform XCH
into the interactive and animated Web application
we are aiming for, we prefer to use a Web toolkit.
We chose OpenLaszlo which since version 4 is no
longer restricted to one particular run-time platform
for content delivery (Flash) but can also compile
source code into AJAX-like DHTML code which is
natively supported by most current browsers. Open-
Laszlo also makes it very easy to animate any of its
visual components (widgets). Its XML-based pro-
gramming language (LZX) is as declarative as XSLT
but adds object-orientation and supports creating re-
usable class libraries.
Figure 6 shows an overview of the current sys-
tem architecture. Its upper half depicts an exist-
ing NLG system modified to produce XCH output.
Its lower half outlines the new presentation module
which takes XCH as input. Here, report.lxz is the
domain-specific part of the presentation module im-
plementation, and cinehypertext.lzx is the domain-
independent, library part. We expect that our emerg-
ing cinehypertext library and format will prove use-
ful in other domains and systems.

This work aims to identify ways of presenting hy-
pertext discourse which employ graphics to signal
discourse structure in a systematic and principled
way, by making articulate use of the space-temporal
dimensions of the electronic medium. The work is
part of a larger effort in natural language genera-
tion, aimed at producing different renditions of the
same semantic content for different purposes and
for different media. One of the novel aspects of
our work is that we are generating ‘paraphrases’ that
vary not just along the traditional dimensions (dis-
course, syntax, lexicalisation) but also in terms of
graphical presentation (e.g., as textual reports in dif-
ferent styles – including linear vs. non-linear – or as
slides for a presentation).

One of the challenges this poses for text research is that coherence markers of the traditional notion of text often do not work for this new medium. We are exploring new possibilities for signalling coherence in non-linear documents, exploiting the graphical features of a visually rich medium yet to be systematically exploited as a dimension of signification. This work is set in the context of the textual presentation of medical records from a repository of data-encoded medical histories. 2 Structure representation in non-linear text As we discuss elsewhere (Mancini et al., 2007), discourse markers such as adverbials, pronouns and connectives cannot reliably be used to signal the discourse relation between hypertext nodes, since nodes can be accessible in more than one way, via paths that reflect different relevancies. This restriction is less likely to apply to graphical features, because they are visual and work in space. Owing to its technical characteristics, hypertext is a spatial medium (Carter, 2000) as well as a temporal one (Luesebrink, 1998), in which spatial structures have a temporal dimension and realisation: both space and time can be exploited in hypert</context>

Additionally, a number of representational rules for visually expressing discourse relations between hypertext nodes can be derived from the semiology of graphics, according to which graphic features can be employed to express conceptual relationships of similarity, difference, order and proportion, exploiting the properties of the visual image (Koch, 2001). Following these principles and rules, we have designed and begun testing a series of prototype visual patterns expressing coherence relations in nonlinear discourse (Mancini et al., 2007). 3 Graphics devices to visualise interactive text structure Our empirical work so far shows that graphics can indeed be used to express abstract relational concepts (Power et al., 2003; Mancini, 2005). But can graphics usefully support the expression of discourse structure in hypertext navigation? Can visual discourse markers support comprehension, substituting or complementing textual discourse markers in non-linear documents? If so, how do these textual and graphical features interact: can they express the same semantic meaning by following the same principles or do they, due to their diffe</context>

To achieve this, coherence relations are used as document structuring principles during discourse construction to define hypertext links. These are then dynamically rendered during navigation through the consistent and concurrent use of the medium’s spatial and temporal graphic features connoting the nodes. We refer to this paradigm as cinehypertext. Having established a parallel between textual and visual processing, research informed by Gestalt theory has proposed relevant principles of document design (Campbell, 1995; Riley and Parker, 1998). Additionally, a number of representational rules for visually expressing discourse relations between hypertext nodes can be derived from the semiology of graphics, according to which graphic features can be employed to express conceptual relationships of similarity, difference, order and proportion, exploiting the properties of the visual image (Koch, 2001).
