We detail the design, development and evalua-
tion of Augmentative and Alternative Com-
munication (AAC) software which encourages
rapid conversational interaction. The system
uses Natural Language Generation (NLG)
technology to automatically generate conver-
sational utterances from a domain knowledge
base modelled from content suggested by a
small AAC user group. Findings from this
work are presented along with a discussion
about how NLG might be successfully applied
to conversational AAC systems in the future.

Augmentative and Alternative Communication
(AAC) systems assist non-speaking people communi-
cate. Reasons for lack of speech are varied and can be
complex, but they are typically related to some pro-
found cognitive and/or motor impairment.
Most AAC systems are computer based, utilize syn-
thesized speech output and employ a phrase-
construction approach to input. This approach requires
the user to construct the majority of their utterances live
during conversation. Undoubtedly this facilitated com-
munication is hugely important to those without natural
speech. However, this process is often unacceptably
slow and can lead to problematic and stilted interac-
tions, mostly due to the rapid nature of unimpeded face-
to-face communication.
Previous work has shown that it is possible to hold
mutually rewarding conversations using wholly pre-
stored material, known as the phrase-storage approach.
Utterances are authored ahead of time and can be se-
lected and output immediately leading to quicker com-

munication rates. However, this approach suffers from
several drawbacks which may have affected its more
general adoption.
Furthermore, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
technology has proven to be a fruitful line of inquiry
within the field. It has offered a powerful means to im-
prove system productivity and usability. We are current-
ly investigating how Natural Language Generation
(NLG) might be applied in a useful way within an AAC
device geared towards fast-paced and rewarding social
interactions. It is hoped that the linguistic control and
automaticity offered by NLG may go some way towards
addressing the previous criticisms of pre-stored material
regarding its inflexibility and cost in effort.

2.1 Limitations of current AAC
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999850631578947">
High-tech AAC systems typically augment commu-
nication for non-speaking people by allowing live mes-
sage construction through some orthographic means.
Completed messages are generally sent to a speech syn-
thesis engine for output during communication with
others. Many people who require AAC have associated
physical disabilities which reduce the speed achievable
using input methods such as keyboards, pointing devic-
es or touch-screens. The rate achievable using most
commercial AAC systems is highly dependent on the
nature of the user‟s disabilities but a generally accepted
figure is in the region of 2-15 words per minute (Hig-
ginbotham, Shane et al. 2007), at least an order of mag-
nitude slower than most natural speakers.
This relatively slow rate of input is a crucial factor in
some of the issues that arise in AAC-facilitated commu-
nication. Because of the effort and time required to
create utterances, the user may not be able to construct
messages quickly enough to take active roles in fast

paced conversations. As a result users may become pas-
sive while also typically using a smaller communicative
repertoire than natural speakers (Light 1988).
Narrative, an important type of interpersonal com-
munication, is not well handled in most communication
aids (Waller 1992). Delayed response and slow rate of
aided-communication are correlated with higher inci-
dence of breakdown in communication and lesser per-
ceptions of the AAC user (Todman and Rzepecka 2003;
McCarthy and Light 2005). This is primarily due to
conflict between the relatively long time necessary to
formulate an utterance and the fast paced nature of con-
versation.
These problems are particularly critical in social con-
texts. AAC users typically have small social circles and
are dependent on contact with families and carers. They
often lack self-esteem and have negative self-image. As
a result, developing new relationships and experiencing
new things can be difficult, despite being a major priori-
ty in their lives (Datillo, Estrella et al. 2007).
Some work has suggested that the use of pre-stored
conversational material based on conversation models
could help increase communication rate and conversa-
tion quality. Alm (1988) showed that it is possible to
successfully model short „chat‟ conversations involving
greetings, personal enquiries and small-talk. Further-
more, the TALK system allowed a user to pre-store a
large volume of material on specific topics so that
whole utterances could be selected and output. The sys-
tem also made heavy use of quick-fire phrases, classes
of regularly used utterance which could be accessed
quickly, and showed that communication using solely
pre-stored material was viable (Todman and Alm 2003).
Despite encouraging results and the development of a
commercial product, the phrase-storage approach to
social communication has not gained wide popularity.
The reasons for this are complex, but include: the rela-
tive inflexibility of pre-stored material; the costs asso-
ciated with authoring the material and keeping the
material up-to-date; and the vastly different nature of
the approach and different training requirements neces-
sary to achieve success.

2.2 The role of NLP in AAC
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999585">
NLP technology has provided many benefits to AAC
system designers. Possibly the first technology to be
included in many commercial systems to date was word
prediction and completion. There have also been many
research prototypes exploring the applicability of more
emerging technologies such as named entity recognition
from synthesized speech (Wisenburn and Higginbotham
2008), the generation of well-formed utterances from
telegraphic input (McCoy, Pennington et al. 1998) and
the automatic identification of contextual vocabulary
from the web (Higginbotham, Bisantz et al. 2008).
Netzer and Elhadad (2006) used NLG to allow the se-
mantic authoring of utterances.
However, NLG, in the sense of data-to-text (Reiter
and Dale 2000), has had limited application within AAC
thus far, although Reiter et al. (2009) showed it is possi-
ble to generate stories from sensor data which allow a
child using AAC to tell others about their day at school.

2.3 System Rationale
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998205">
This project is exploring the use of NLG to produce
conversational utterances in AAC systems designed for
social interaction. At the outset it was hoped that using
NLG might address some of the difficulties observed in
pre-storage systems. For instance, the generation com-
ponent could theoretically produce a range of utterances
and speech act types automatically from the same un-
derlying data and adapt these somewhat to the interac-
tional context. Using NLG would also have the benefit
of offering control over the well-formedness of the out-
put, an important consideration given the difficulty
some AAC users have in achieving literacy (Sandberg
and Hjelmquist 1997). The fact that the system has an
inherent awareness of the semantic content of the lin-
guistic output, rather than simply being stored as canned
text, is also a potential benefit. In other words, NLG
might offer a level of automaticity and flexibility that
traditional pre-storage systems cannot offer, as well as
potentially reducing the level of pre-authoring required
from the user.

3.1 User-centered methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999668384615385">
To try to assess how useful NLG could be in this
context we adopted a user-centered approach to the de-
sign of the system. A group of 3 AAC users has been
recruited, all of whom currently use some form of high-
tech AAC. Literacy amongst the group is varied. Two of
the individuals use the alphabetic keyboard-based
Lightwriter communication device currently, and have
normal cognitive and visual-perceptive skills. All of the
users have cerebral palsy and dysarthria, and have been
involved in previous software evaluations.
Weekly or twice weekly sessions were held with
each user for several months while the software was
being produced. Sessions consisted of various activities:

discussion about the user&apos;s ideas for the software and
technology; the identification of topics and collation of
input data to the system; demonstrations of the new fea-
tures or changes since the last session; system training;
and dry-run test conversations between the investigators
and the users.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99984">
3.2 System Architecture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992453125">
A growing line of inquiry in the NLG community is
the generation of language from ontologies (Mellish and
Sun 2005). An ontology is a logical and hierarchical
model of the different concepts and the nature of rela-
tionships between concepts in a particular domain.
These concepts and relationships can be mapped onto
linguistic constructs to allow for the production of natu-
ral language descriptions (Karakatsiotis, Galanis et al.
2008) of parts of the ontology.
In the case of our system, we are trying to model
conversational topics that would be of interest in social
conversation between users of the system and their co-
conversationalists. The current categories of topic we
are experimenting with include travelling, listening to
music, watching films and attending concerts. Many
categories are based on a simple event model which
defines the basic characteristics common to all events,
such as a time of occurrence (see Fig.1). We have also
included concepts such as Person and Place which are
associated with events to form a logical model of a par-
ticular event type.
A separate file is created unique to each user which is
linked to the original model. This is filled with individ-
uals consisting of data from the user. In other words,
rather than defining the concept of an event as we did
with the original ontology, here we are creating a de-
scription of an actual event and any other details, such
as people or places, associated with it. We have defined
our ontology in OWL, a standard language for the defi-
nition of ontologies, and each piece of knowledge is
effectively stored as a RDF Triple consisting of a sub-
ject, predicate and object.
</bodyText>

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935428571429">
The user&apos;s knowledge base is turned into useful con-
versational utterances through a template-driven utter-
ance generation system (e.g. Van Deemter, Krahmer et
al. 2005). A large set of templates has been authored,
using the SimpleNLG programming interface, which
turn data from the onotlogy into natural language utter-
ances. The templates are created as concrete syntax
trees containing unspecified „slots&apos; and parameters (See
Fig.2). These syntax trees map out the syntactic struc-
ture of the template), and are linked to a particular class
in the ontology so that only appropriate templates are
applied to each individual. Slots are used to add con-
textually relevant clauses to our utterances. For exam-
ple, a template might contain a ‘time’ slot, the contents
of which are derived from the time of the event in ques-
tion. For instance, the slot might be filled with “next
Tuesday evening”, “a month ago” or “this morning”
depending on the context. Example parameters include
the tense with which the utterance should be generated,
and whether a pronoun or full noun phrase should be
used to refer to the subject of the utterance.

<bodyText confidence="0.999993125">
In addition to the language produced from the model
and knowledge base we have included the ability to add
canned text phrases to each individual.
This is necessary because there may be things that
you wish to be able say about a topic which it is not
feasible to model. Because we have a fairly diverse set
of topics it is simply not possible to model all aspects of
these topics in a reasonable time. There is effectively a
trade-off between complexity of the model and how
maintainable and representative it is. A more complex
model will lead to more expressive generated language,
but will cost a great deal more to design and maintain.
In the case of our system, a „lowest common denomina-
tor&apos; domain model combined with additional canned
text has proven to be a relatively straightforward and
inexpensive design.

The system has also been designed to learn over time
the sequences of utterances a user selects and suggest
next moves based on past behavior. The system does
this by maintaining a directional weighted graph which
records sequences of utterances as they are used. The
graph works by recording each individual utterance as a
node in the graph and creating relationships between
these nodes as they occur. The more often two utter-
ances appear in sequence the higher the value given to
the edge between the two corresponding nodes.

3.3 Conversation model and interface issues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995255319149">
Perhaps the most challenging aspect of taking the
system from initial concept to working prototype has
been finding the most effective way of interfacing the
technology. We have found that due to the complexity
of the underlying technology, reaching the stage where
generated utterances are both useful and accessible to
the user during conversation has required careful con-
sideration and the trialing of several approaches with the
user group.
It was envisaged that the generative power of NLG
would be its most powerful benefit. The system could
realize the same piece of data as numerous speech act
types and, within a speech type, in several different
phrasings. This offered the ability to counteract the in-
flexibility and uniformity of pre-stored utterances
somewhat. However, we have had mixed success in
achieving this goal as it has proven difficult to find an
effective way to interface this enhanced choice and va-
riety to the user. If there is a large volume of generated
utterances available to choose from we must provide an
efficient means by which the material is presented or
organized so that the desired utterance can be located
quickly. If a large choice results in a delayed selection
and thus conversational turn, we may then lose any rate
and speed of response benefits which would negate the
need to use pre-stored and generated material at all.
To address this problem, we attempted to design a
conversational model which controlled the generation of
utterances so that only the utterances deemed most like-
ly were presented to the user, thus reducing the cogni-
tive load required to search through a large set. This was
done using a basic system where the templates were
tagged according to where it might be most likely to be
used in a conversation on a topic. For instance, a tem-
plate might produce a pre-sequence, an introduction,
elaboration or concluding remark, or it may produce a
interrogative. With the addition of historical sequential
moves from our directional graph we could begin to
present subsets of utterances to the user according to
where they were in topic development.
Another approach trialed was inspired by the Gricean
maxim of quantity. Each template contains meta-data
about the information it expresses. For each generated
utterance selected, we can „rule out‟ further generation
of the same information. This is based on the assump-
tion that speakers will generally avoid repetition. We
have found that this technique provides a useful way of
supporting discourse coherence within conversations.
Finally, using the logical model of topics we have
created, it is possible to support and model stepwise
topic progression. We can suggest, based on the model
and the user knowledge base, other topics linked to the
one currently selected. For example, if we were talking
about an upcoming holiday to London with a friend
called Bob we may want to the change topical perspec-
tive to related aspects of the trip. We might want to talk
about London as a place, Bob as a friend, and other trips
we have taken with Bob or to London. Because these
concepts are all distinct within the model, they each
have their own set of associated templates and result in
sets of candidate utterances with differing perspectives.
Navigating to related topics in this manner should be
quicker since related topics do not have to be located
manually. Although the users are still being trained in
this approach to topic change, early evaluations are
promising. It enables a „one-click‟ transition to related
topics, allowing the user to elaborate on certain aspects
of a previous topic and respond quickly to questions
from their conversational partners.
Building on the last two mechanisms, we can also
generate bridging phrases which allow for more cohe-
sive changes in topic. This allows for a more eloquent
transition to a new topic and also aids the discourse co-
herence.
All of these approaches in fact belie, to some degree,
the complexity of conversation. By its very nature, con-
versation is unpredictable, and the purpose and meaning
of sequential moves are highly dependent on their con-
text (Clark 1996). However, any form of context identi-
fication, such as speech recognition (Wisenburn and
Higginbotham 2008), is likely to present a major tech-
nical challenge in any production AAC system at the
current time. The above are simply at attempt to model,
using the NLP/AI techniques available, aspects of
communication process, to show the potential benefits
when using NLG-produced utterances rather than sim-
ple canned text utterances.
Application of some of the above techniques resulted
in a highly fluid interface in which the utterances dis-
played changed rapidly according to the conversation
model. This presented a major challenge to users learn-
ing the system, with all displaying a strong preference
for a static interface where the same utterances could be
found in the same location each time they were desired.

using the system. Speaker A is the user and speaker
B is an unaided speaker. The right-hand column
shows the interface selections necessary prior to
selecting the utterance from a set of possibilities.
The marker G represents a generated utterance, C
represents canned text. The remainder are quick-
fire utterances.
We believe this does not suggest that use of such
conversational models and semantic processing is not
feasible, but simply that in the scope of the current
work it has not been possible to fully evaluate their
potential. Thus we have chosen to generate candidate
phrases in a static manner without the predictive as-
pects described above. These changes have allowed for
quicker achievement of proficiency and have lowered
the cognitive effort required to navigate the interface.
In the latest version of the software, we have de-
fined a set of templates for each topic which when
realized in series produce a coherent narrative. They
can still be selected individually by the user for output,
so they retain ultimate control of what is said, but the
utterances are presented in a natural order. This means
that the user can easily make use of the utterances as a
narrative or can choose according to the particular sit-
uation and context. Any interrogative templates are
displayed in a different part of the interface. We have
set up a two column display so that interrogatives and
other statements are clearly delineated.
This approach has had very promising results as we
have found that users no longer have to search through
a list of suggestions which changes after each conver-
sational turn. They can also use the structured nature
of the generated utterances to confidently introduce the
different topics in conversation. We are finding some
evidence of increased self-selection at the end of their
current turn as the user is easily able to continue their
narrative automatically without having to worry about
the location of their next turn in the interface. There is
some other evidence of this structured application of
NLG to narrative as being a promising area (Reiter,
Turner et al. 2009).
We also believe that the passivity and lack of initia-
tion observed in AAC users could be positively ad-
dressed if AAC systems can better support a more
varied communicative repertoire and suitable training
is administered to show users how to confidently use
these different constructs (e.g. Todman 2000). Early
training sessions with our user group have again
proved positive with increased use of the trained fea-
tures and interaction styles.

3.4 Authoring user content
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912588888889">
Currently we have not managed to produce a tool that
the user can use to update their knowledge base them-
selves. The ontology editing tool used in the program,
Protégé, is a free academic software package designed
for knowledge engineers and thus has a high degree of
internal complexity and takes time to learn. It is also not
a particularly accessible piece of software.
We have worked with the users to build up their
knowledge bases over a series of meetings by allowing
them to suggest individuals to add while entering the
details for them into the system. The process of defining
new individual is very quick, usually requiring the input
of just a few words and selection of the associated indi-
viduals. However, one of the main criticisms on the part
of the users is that for the system to be useful in the long
term, it must be kept up to date, as old material will
quickly become less relevant and useful in less frequent
situations. For this reason it is critical to the success of
any NLG-driven communication system that the data
input is as simple and seamless as possible.
We have shown in our system that it is possible to get
some limited data automatically from online sources,
rather than having to input it manually. Many web ser-
vices are being made available which enable program-
mers to access data from online services in their
applications. For instance, both Amazon and YouTube
have their own APIs which allow 3rd party applications
to request content information from these services.
The notion of the semantic web is also related to this.
There is a large effort underway to define how we might
structure and link information on the web in such a way
that more of it can be processed automatically by com-
puters and made available in interchangeable formats.
Shared data and semantic web technologies such as
these operate on the same premise as our proposed
communication system in that they map out the basic
vocabulary required to describe a domain, and allow
people describe aspects of the domain in these terms.
We have used an API provided by social music web-
site Last.fm to show that it is possible to create relevant
conversational utterances without any authoring re-
quirement whatsoever. By supplying the users Last.fm
username, we can use a web service supplied by the site
to query the user&apos;s recent activity, for instance the songs
they have listened to, songs rated highly or events which
they have signed up to attend. Because the output from
these services comes as structured XML document we
can simply map it&apos;s schema onto our own vocabulary
and feed the appropriate data to our templates to pro-
duce utterances.
If web services are to be used we must have an
equivalent local vocabulary to which we can map the
data returned from any queries we send the service.
However, in the case of semantic web sources, for ex-
ample the FOAF (friend-of-a-friend) vocabulary (Brick-
ley) describing online social networks, the process is
simpler as we can simply use the pre-existing vocabu-
lary standard ourselves rather than having to develop
our own. Despite the semantic web being in its infancy,
the notion of shared data is growing in popularity and
many popular websites and organizations are providing
access to their information in a structured way.
One problem with using these types of data acquisi-
tion methods for our purposes is that the data is largely
generic and any personal opinion or evaluative informa-
tion personal to the user is limited. In some cases we
may be able to query the data source for a rating
awarded to a particular piece of content, for instance the
star rating system on YouTube, but it is not clear how
expressive the produced language will be since the
process is likely to be a simple mapping from the rating
to a suitable adjective. As in our system, the potential
usefulness of the generated language is likely to be in-
creased if it is possible for the user to annotate the top-
ics with their own canned text expressions and
evaluations. This will enable the system to express more
of the individual&apos;s personality and opinions.
We believe this is an area of great interest for AAC.
There is growing evidence of the importance of the in-
ternet in the lives of disabled people, particularly its role
as a communication medium for people with communi-
cation impairments (Cohen 1999). By harnessing the
large volumes of data created when using modern hard-
ware and software systems and transforming it into use-
ful utterances, we can begin to address one of the main
criticisms of whole utterance approaches to AAC since
there would be no authoring requirement on the part of
the users. This is certainly by no means a simple
process and this approach will require further investiga-
tion, but as semantic web technologies reach maturity

4 Formal Evaluation Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960349397591">
In our evaluations so far, we have concentrated on
training the users in its operation, updating conversa-
tional material and implementing changes based on the
user feedback. We have recently begun testing the sys-
tem in real conversational encounters and the results
have been promising. We have found it is possible to
hold pleasing conversations lasting up to 20 minutes
with unfamiliar partners, with the aided communicator
achieving a rate of upwards of 40 wpm.
There also seems to be higher incidences of initia-
tions on the part of the user, with them making good use
of both the scripted NLG material, the quick fire phrases
and their own pre-stored material. The topic progression
feature is currently being underused but subjects are
responding well to training sessions on how to incorpo-
rate this to reduce their response time and expand on
topics to extend the amount they are able to say.
Formal evaluations are now being undertaken. An
AB multiple-baseline study design is being conducted in
which each aided communicator has a series of conver-
sations with 12 unknown and unaided conversation
partners. In the A condition, the aided participants use
their existing AAC system, while in the B condition
they use our prototype system. Each conversation will
be limited to approximately 10 minutes, and the ses-
sions will be split across a three non-consecutive days to
avoid user fatigue.
There will be at least 3 conversations in both the A
and B conditions, and the intervention point will be ran-
domized across the remaining 6 conversations to allow
for valid inferences to be made despite the small n value
(Todman and Dugard 2001). This also reduces the bias
introduced by any training effects and avoids the need
to use a response-guided intervention after baseline per-
formance has been established. The difficulty and ex-
pense of recruiting large numbers of subjects in AAC
studies is a known problem (Higginbotham 1995) and
therefore any findings from quantitative analysis per-
formed cannot be generalized across the AAC popula-
tion. However, we expect to be able to achieve a p value
using the randomization design of &lt;0.05 so the results
should at least be internally robust and give a good indi-
cation of whether further investigation is warranted.
The conversations will be audio-recorded and ana-
lyzed for a number of metrics. Primarily we are interest-
ed in measuring the rate at which people are able to
communicate using the new system as this seems to be
one of the clearest indicators of success when evaluating
a new AAC intervention. We expect to the effect size
observed across the conditions to be large.
We are also particularly interested whether it is poss-
ible to use automatically generated material while main-
taining or enhancing the enjoyment and quality of the
encounter for all participants. It is still unclear how
acceptable generated material will be to the user so we
will measure the relative frequency of generated and
canned-text utterances.
In previous studies it has also been shown that the
use of a whole-utterance approach can change the dy-
namics of communication, such as relative speech act
distribution and number and type of initiation, so we are
interested to see how the availability generated material
might impact this and what role it might play. A coding
schema based on Wang (2007) will be used to categor-
ize the utterances used.
We are also asking the aided and unaided conversa-
tion partners to complete questionnaires regarding vari-
ous subjective ratings of the interactions and, in the case
of the unaided speakers, impressions of the aided com-
municator. The questions will be based on a re-
evaluation of those suggested by Todman (2000) and
answers will be requested on a 7-point rating scale. Pre-
vious work has shown that quicker, flowing interactions
with less breakdowns or delays can lead to more re-
warding interactions for both participants. We expect to
observe these effects in our system but it‟s as yet un-
clear what impact the automatically generated phrases
will have, if any, on perceptions of the user.
Although the relatively small number of participants
means it is unlikely that we will be able to make robust
inferences from this data, we hope that results will be
indicative of the naturalness and acceptability of auto-
matically generated utterances.

5 Discussion &amp; Future Plans

<bodyText confidence="0.999735461538461">
One of the primary reasons that AAC systems featur-
ing NLP technology prove useful is that they go some
way to leveling the playing field for many users. They
have the potential to support the user in ways which
reduce the effort required to communicate yet may im-
prove the quality of the communication. There are many
NLP technologies, such as NLG, that deserve further
attention within the field of AAC to determine what
they can offer.
Although our system has shown some encouraging
preliminary results there are still many unanswered
questions with regards to the role NLG can play. For
example, it is not clear how appealing NLG utterances
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999972744186047">
are to use. Given that the user has not authored the form
of the utterances themselves there is an argument that
using them may feel unnatural. After the formal evalua-
tions we should be able provide analysis indicating
whether NLG phrases are being used and in which sit-
uations they are proving most useful.
One of the most challenging aspects of designing the
system was the HCI challenge of incorporating some of
these technologies. While it is obvious to the user that
phrases are being generated automatically, and that
these phrases are generated when a topic is selected, it is
still important to note that the technologies have been
intentionally kept largely transparent to the user. When
using a communication system, the most important
thing is the ability to say what you want to say, but is
not yet clear whether the technical nature of the soft-
ware may be an alienating factor since the user current-
ly has no access to the template construction or domain
modeling aspects of the system.
At the current time, the domain modeling and tem-
plate construction processes are quite complex and ex-
pensive. Tools are becoming available, from the NLG
community, which go some way to addressing the diffi-
culty of interfacing these types of technology to non-
experts (Bilidas, Theologou et al. 2007; Power, Stevens
et al. 2009) but these are largely unsolved problems.
Domain modeling itself is problematic in that one
persons notion of what defines a particular concept is
often different to someone else&apos;s. For instance, one per-
son&apos;s idea of sport might encompass the sporting activi-
ties they take part in, while another person&apos;s idea of
sport is that which they follow or watch on the televi-
sion. This has clear implications for the general usabili-
ty of the system. Using semantic web vocabularies may
address this somewhat since they are likely to be more
specific to a particular purpose and be more mature and
interoperable than the ‘home-brew’ domain models we
have used for the prototype.
Using whole-utterance approaches to communication
clearly requires the adoption of a different mindset. Ra-
ther than being able to construct a novel message the
user has to „make do’ with whatever is available in the
system. Despite the advantages observed while using
such systems, they have still not become generally pop-
ular. It is likely that any NLG whole utterance system
would similarly not gain immediate acceptance because
it is vastly different to other systems and approaches to
communication available. To some degree we are ask-
ing the user of our NLG system to think in an object
orientated manner since they must understand the un-
derlying model and the way the concepts are structured
to make the most of the system. Again it is not yet clear
how natural this process is and how much training is
required to become an expert user of such a system.
However perhaps the major strength of these types of
system is the way in which they help scaffold interac-
tion so the AAC user can be much more active in con-
versation and use an increased repertoire. The design of
the software is such that it encourages the use of types
of phrases often underused by AAC users, for example,
initiations, elaborating moves, questions and the differ-
ent classes of quick-fire remarks. One interesting ques-
tion is whether the use of NLG might make it easier to
encourage the user to use new types of conversational
move. Since no full text-authoring is required the user
does not even have feel confident authoring the utter-
ance, it is simply provided and can be used or experi-
mented with. Scaffolding interactions in this way may
be one of the most interesting avenues for NLP and AI
technologies with AAC in the future.
The architecture of the prototype, although effective,
lacks efficiency and may be difficult to reuse. A great
deal of work is being done by NLG researchers investi-
gating how NLG architectures might be made more
modular and reusable. This is an ongoing problem but it
seems sensible to consider how a pipeline architecture
(Reiter and Dale 2000) might work in practice for this
type of system.
At the moment, the system requires a reasonable lev-
el of literacy because the interface is mainly text based.
However, semiotic systems are preferred because of the
literacy problems observed in many AAC users. It is not
clear how NLG may impact on semiotic message con-
struction but systems such as Compansion (McCoy,
Pennington et al. 1998) show there may useful applica-
tions in this area too.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999661875">
Despite having only been able to perform informal
evaluations so far, we believe we have seen some en-
couraging signals that NLG may have potential as an
augmentative communication technology to assist in
generating conversational utterances. We believe that
the rapid access to well-formed, contextually generated
material offered in our system could lead to significant
benefits for the AAC user and their interlocutors.
There are further exciting possibilities with regards to
the technology, particularly the ability to harvest per-
sonal data from the internet and other computer usage
so that it can be transformed into useful phrases for in-
clusion in communication aids. We hope to have a rich-
er set of data and results in the coming months after the
system training and formal evaluations have been com-
pleted.

AAC users typically have small social circles and are dependent on contact with families and carers. They often lack self-esteem and have negative self-image. As a result, developing new relationships and experiencing new things can be difficult, despite being a major priority in their lives (Datillo, Estrella et al. 2007). Some work has suggested that the use of pre-stored conversational material based on conversation models could help increase communication rate and conversation quality. Alm (1988) showed that it is possible to successfully model short „chat‟ conversations involving greetings, personal enquiries and small-talk. Furthermore, the TALK system allowed a user to pre-store a large volume of material on specific topics so that whole utterances could be selected and output. The system also made heavy use of quick-fire phrases, classes of regularly used utterance which could be accessed quickly, and showed that communication using solely pre-stored material was viable (Todman and Alm 2003).

Building on the last two mechanisms, we can also generate bridging phrases which allow for more cohesive changes in topic. This allows for a more eloquent transition to a new topic and also aids the discourse coherence. All of these approaches in fact belie, to some degree, the complexity of conversation. By its very nature, conversation is unpredictable, and the purpose and meaning of sequential moves are highly dependent on their context (Clark 1996). However, any form of context identification, such as speech recognition (Wisenburn and Higginbotham 2008), is likely to present a major technical challenge in any production AAC system at the current time. The above are simply at attempt to model, using the NLP/AI techniques available, aspects of communication process, to show the potential benefits when using NLG-produced utterances rather than simple canned text utterances. Application of some of the above techniques resulted in a highly fluid interface in which the utterances displayed changed rapidly according to the conversation model. </context>

As in our system, the potential usefulness of the generated language is likely to be increased if it is possible for the user to annotate the topics with their own canned text expressions and evaluations. This will enable the system to express more of the individual&apos;s personality and opinions. We believe this is an area of great interest for AAC. There is growing evidence of the importance of the internet in the lives of disabled people, particularly its role as a communication medium for people with communication impairments (Cohen 1999). By harnessing the large volumes of data created when using modern hardware and software systems and transforming it into useful utterances, we can begin to address one of the main criticisms of whole utterance approaches to AAC since there would be no authoring requirement on the part of the users. This is certainly by no means a simple process and this approach will require further investigation, but as semantic web technologies reach maturity 15 and gain wider adoption it should be clearer what the potential of the technology is. 4 Formal Evaluation Methodology In our evaluations so far, w</context>

Weekly or twice weekly sessions were held with each user for several months while the software was being produced. Sessions consisted of various activities: 11 discussion about the user&apos;s ideas for the software and technology; the identification of topics and collation of input data to the system; demonstrations of the new features or changes since the last session; system training; and dry-run test conversations between the investigators and the users. 3.2 System Architecture A growing line of inquiry in the NLG community is the generation of language from ontologies (Mellish and Sun 2005). An ontology is a logical and hierarchical model of the different concepts and the nature of relationships between concepts in a particular domain. These concepts and relationships can be mapped onto linguistic constructs to allow for the production of natural language descriptions (Karakatsiotis, Galanis et al. 2008) of parts of the ontology. In the case of our system, we are trying to model conversational topics that would be of interest in social conversation between users of the system and their coconversationalists. The current categories of topic we are experimenting with include travel</context>

Scaffolding interactions in this way may be one of the most interesting avenues for NLP and AI technologies with AAC in the future. The architecture of the prototype, although effective, lacks efficiency and may be difficult to reuse. A great deal of work is being done by NLG researchers investigating how NLG architectures might be made more modular and reusable. This is an ongoing problem but it seems sensible to consider how a pipeline architecture (Reiter and Dale 2000) might work in practice for this type of system. At the moment, the system requires a reasonable level of literacy because the interface is mainly text based. However, semiotic systems are preferred because of the literacy problems observed in many AAC users. It is not clear how NLG may impact on semiotic message construction but systems such as Compansion (McCoy, Pennington et al. 1998) show there may useful applications in this area too. 6 Conclusion Despite having only been able to perform informal evaluations so far, we believe we have seen some encouraging signals that NLG may have potent</context>

At the outset it was hoped that using NLG might address some of the difficulties observed in pre-storage systems. For instance, the generation component could theoretically produce a range of utterances and speech act types automatically from the same underlying data and adapt these somewhat to the interactional context. Using NLG would also have the benefit of offering control over the well-formedness of the output, an important consideration given the difficulty some AAC users have in achieving literacy (Sandberg and Hjelmquist 1997). The fact that the system has an inherent awareness of the semantic content of the linguistic output, rather than simply being stored as canned text, is also a potential benefit. In other words, NLG might offer a level of automaticity and flexibility that traditional pre-storage systems cannot offer, as well as potentially reducing the level of pre-authoring required from the user. 3 System Development 3.1 User-centered methodology To try to assess how useful NLG could be in this context we adopted a user-centered approach to the design of the system.

There is some other evidence of this structured application of NLG to narrative as being a promising area (Reiter, Turner et al. 2009). We also believe that the passivity and lack of initiation observed in AAC users could be positively addressed if AAC systems can better support a more varied communicative repertoire and suitable training is administered to show users how to confidently use these different constructs (e.g. Todman 2000). Early training sessions with our user group have again proved positive with increased use of the trained features and interaction styles. 14 Figure 3 - System interface 3.4 Authoring user content Currently we have not managed to produce a tool that the user can use to update their knowledge base themselves.

Alm (1988) showed that it is possible to successfully model short „chat‟ conversations involving greetings, personal enquiries and small-talk. Furthermore, the TALK system allowed a user to pre-store a large volume of material on specific topics so that whole utterances could be selected and output. The system also made heavy use of quick-fire phrases, classes of regularly used utterance which could be accessed quickly, and showed that communication using solely pre-stored material was viable (Todman and Alm 2003). Despite encouraging results and the development of a commercial product, the phrase-storage approach to social communication has not gained wide popularity. The reasons for this are complex, but include: the relative inflexibility of pre-stored material; the costs associated with authoring the material and keeping the material up-to-date; and the vastly different nature of the approach and different training requirements necessary to achieve success. 2.2 The role of NLP in AAC NLP technology has provided many benefits to AAC system designers.

There will be at least 3 conversations in both the A and B conditions, and the intervention point will be randomized across the remaining 6 conversations to allow for valid inferences to be made despite the small n value (Todman and Dugard 2001). This also reduces the bias introduced by any training effects and avoids the need to use a response-guided intervention after baseline performance has been established.

Building on the last two mechanisms, we can also generate bridging phrases which allow for more cohesive changes in topic. This allows for a more eloquent transition to a new topic and also aids the discourse coherence. All of these approaches in fact belie, to some degree, the complexity of conversation. By its very nature, conversation is unpredictable, and the purpose and meaning of sequential moves are highly dependent on their context (Clark 1996). However, any form of context identification, such as speech recognition (Wisenburn and Higginbotham 2008), is likely to present a major technical challenge in any production AAC system at the current time. The above are simply at attempt to model, using the NLP/AI techniques available, aspects of communication process, to show the potential benefits when using NLG-produced utterances rather than simple canned text utterances. Application of some of the above techniques resulted in a highly fluid interface in which the utterances displayed changed rapidly according to the conversation model.
