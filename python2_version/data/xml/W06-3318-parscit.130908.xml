Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999943578947368">
Nested Named Entities (nested NEs), one
containing another, are commonly seen in
biomedical text, e.g., accounting for
16.7% of all named entities in GENIA
corpus. While many works have been
done in recognizing non-nested NEs,
nested NEs have been largely neglected.
In this work, we treat the task as a binary
classification problem and solve it using
Support Vector Machines. For each token
in nested NEs, we use two schemes to set
its class label: labeling as the outmost
entity or the inner entity. Our preliminary
results show that while the outmost
labeling tends to work better in
recognizing the outmost entities, the inner
labeling recognizes the inner NEs better.
This result should be useful for
recognition of nested NEs.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9996927">
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task in
biomedical text mining, as biomedical named
entities usually represent biomedical concepts of
research interest (e.g., protein/gene/virus, etc).
Nested NEs (also called embedded NEs, or
cascade NEs) exhibit an interesting phenomenon in
biomedical literature. For example, “human
immuneodeficiency virus type 2 enhancer” is a
DNA domain, while “human immunodeficiency
virus type 2” represents a virus. For simplicity, we
call the former the outmost entity (if it is not inside
another entity), while the later the inner entity (it
may have another one inside).
Nested NEs account for 16.7% of all entities in
GENIA corpus (Kim, 2003). Moreover, they often
represent important relations between entities
(Nedadic, 2004), as in the above example.
However, there are few results on recognizing
them. Many studies only consider the outmost
entities, as in BioNLP/NLPBA 2004 Shared Task
(Kim, 2004).
In this work, we use a machine learning method
to recognize nested NEs in GENIA corpus. We
view the task as a classification problem for each
token in a given sentence, and train a SVM model.
We note that nested NEs make it hard to be
considered as a multi-class problem, because a
token in nested entities has more than one class
label. We therefore treat it as a binary-class
problem, using one-vs-rest scheme.

Overall, our work is an application of machine
learning methods to biomedical NER. While most
of earlier approaches rely on handcrafted rules or
dictionaries, many recent works adopt machine
learning approaches, e.g, SVM (Lee, 2003), HMM
(Zhou, 2004), Maximum Entropy (Lin, 2004) and
CRF (Settles,2004), especially with the availability
of annotated corpora such as GENIA, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. We know only one
work (Zhou,2004) that deals with nested NEs to
improve the overall NER performance. However,
their approach is basically rule-based and they did
not report how well the nested NEs are recognized.

For each token, we generate four types of features,
reflecting its characteristics on orthography, part-
of-speech, morphology, and special nouns. We
also use a window of (-2, +2) as its context.
For each token, we use two schemes to set the
class label: outmost labeling and inner labeling. In
the outmost labeling, a token is labeled +1 if the
outmost entity containing it is the target entity,
while in the inner labeling, a token is labeled +1 if
any entity containing it is the target entity.
Otherwise, the token is labeled -1.

We report our preliminary experimental results on
recognizing protein and DNA nested entities. For
each target entity type (e.g., protein) and each
labeling scheme, we obtain a data set containing
490941 instances. We run 5-fold cross-validation,
and measure performance (P/R/F) of exact match,
left/right boundary match w.r.t. outmost and inner
entities respectively. The results are shown in
Table 1 and Table 2.

From the tables, we can see that while the outmost
labeling works (slightly) better for the outmost
entities, the inner labeling works better for the
inner entities. This result seems reasonable in that
each labeling scheme tends to introduces more
entities of its type in the training set.
It is interesting to see that the inner labeling
works much better in identifying inner proteins
than in inner DNAs. The reason could be due to
the fact that there are about three times more inner
proteins than the outmost ones, while the numbers
of inner DNAs and outmost DNAs are roughly the
same (see Section 2.1).
Another observation is that the inner labeling
gains significantly (over the outmost labeling) in
the inner entities, comparing to its loss in the
outmost entities. We are not sure whether this is
the general trend for other types of entities, and if
so, what causes it. We will address this issue in our
following work.
