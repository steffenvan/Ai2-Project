This paper proposes a general theory of conversational
inferences which distinguishes two kinds of inferences:
the hard way and the easy way. The theory accounts for
a wider range of non-literal utterance meanings than
Gricean and relevance theories and is motivated by the
types of utterances in which the hearer fails to infer non-
literal meanings.

This paper first characterizes the kinds of utterance
meanings in the sense of Grice and Levinson
which have not been consistently discussed in the
existing theories but are important in respect of
management of dialog, secondly analyzes the types
of inference invoked by the hearer that derive those
utterance meanings, and thirdly proposes a general
theory of conversational inferences that accounts
for a wider range of non-literal utterance meanings
than Gricean and relevance theories. We will first
outline Gricean theory of conversational implica-
ture and relevance theory in order to give a general
understanding of how inferences are supposed to
work in the hearer’s understanding of utterance
meanings, and to characterize the kinds of utter-
ance meanings we are interested in. Those utter-
ance meanings are either what I call a case of
capricious transition or a case of misplaced topics.
Grice and his followers explain the first case but
they are not sure of what this type really is. They
do not explain the second case. In discussing
Gricean theory as regards those cases, I stress the
importance of Grice’s concept of “rationality.” The
relevance theorists, on the other hand, have also
explained the first case to some extent, but are
awkward in dealing with this case in terms of the
principle of relevance. Although they seem to have
noticed the second case, they have not stipulated a
good enough explanation for it.
To fill these lacunae in the existing theories, I
propose to look at the conversational inferences in
terms of two major categories: the hard way and
the easy way. The hard way inference is done by
the hearer, using the Cooperative Principle given
the fact that one or more maxims are violated. The
easy way inference gives the hearer an output of
non-literal meaning given the utterance of a certain
kind in a certain context. To understand the latter
kind of inferences, we need the concept of ade-
quacy.
I extend Gricean theory by adding the concept
of adequacy of observance of the maxims, in order
to analyze those inexplicable cases. When maxims
are observed, they are observed adequately. When
we say maxims are not observed, we mean they are
not observed in either of the two senses: namely
failing to observe adequately or being observed
beyond the adequate level of observance. The
hearer needs to know, for example, to what extent
the utterance is informative, relevant or perspicu-
ous. I suppose the hearer has to have a criterion
with which to judge whether the utterance observes
a maxim or not, just because the judgment that it
triggers an inference needed to derive what is
meant from what is said. This criterion cannot be
absolute but relative to what the hearer expects to
be adequate for the utterance to be observant of the
maxim.
If an observance of a maxim does not reach
the adequacy expected, the hearer can derive im-
plicatures by the hard way. But if the topic focused
on by the speaker is different from the one the
hearer expected, maxims would be observed be-
yond the adequate level. In this case, the hearer
fails to derive implicatures by the hard way, or de-
rives implicatures by the easy way. What is new in
this theory is that a failure of derivation by the
hearer can be explained by stipulating the two
kinds of inferences. The notion of a failure of deri-
vation is necessary. In the case where the hearer
fails to derive useful implicatures, the hearer
should first notice that the derivation breaks down,
and then the hearer will decide to resume the con-
versation again. I analyze the case of capricious
transition as a case of the easy way inference, and
the case of misplaced topics as a failure of the hard
way inference.
In this paper I describe the overall mechanism
of how the hearer understands utterance meanings.
The hearer may understand the literal meaning of
an utterance, but there are cases where she has to
infer or derive non-literal meanings. Sometimes
she infers by what I call the hard way, and reach
particularized or generalized conversational impli-
catures. Sometimes she understands non-literally
by using the easy way inference, either getting to
conventional implicatures, which I do not look into
in this paper, or particularized conversational im-
plicatures. One part of the particularized conversa-
tional implicatures have been discussed and
analyzed by relevance theory. The other part are
the cases of misplaced topics and capriciously
transition, which I pay special attention in this pa-
per.

2 Gricean theory and relevance theory
2.1 Gricean theory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955181818182">
In Grice’s program, we derive what is unsaid when
it is unnatural to understand what is literally said,
on the assumption that observance of the Coopera-
tive Principle and maxims is reasonable. There are
several ways in which the hearer understands an
utterance non-literally. I focus on one subtype of
what is unsaid, which Grice calls “conversational
implicatures”. The typical case of deriving conver-
sational implicatures in Gricean theory is the case
where the Cooperative Principle is observed, and
one or more of maxims is not observed*1.

<bodyText confidence="0.999200909090909">
The gloss can be that the speaker doesn’t know the
exact time, or doesn’t want to tell the hearer di-
rectly, and that the speaker thinks that saying
“Some of the guests are already leaving” gives the
hearer a clue to know what time it is. In this case,
the maxims of quantity and relation are not ob-
served, and an inference that leads to the implica-
ture gets involved.
In some cases, the speaker’s utterance cannot ob-
serve one or more of the maxims because of the
“clash” of the maxims.

<bodyText confidence="0.985996761904762">
In (2), the speaker cannot observe one or two of
the maxims of Quantity because she doesn’t say
enough. But if she tried to observe the maxims of
Quantity by saying exactly where X lives, she
would violate the maxims of Quality in the sense
that she said what she didn’t know.
Grice says, in his lectures “Logic and Con-
versation,” that he would like to conclude that
observance of the Cooperative Principle and
maxims is reasonable, without defining what
“being reasonable” means. After that he discussed
rational acceptance in his book “Aspects of
Reason.” I take for the discussion in this paper that
being reasonable means speaking with justifiable
grounds. If we suppose that observance of the
Cooperative Principle and maxims is reasonable,
the content which the hearer expects to be the
implicature of the speaker’s utterance may be
derived in the way that the utterance satisfies the
maxim which is violated or at least gives the
reason for violation, in typical cases where the

1 Grice and Levinson admit the case where the Coopera-
tive Principle and all the maxims are observed to the
theory of conversational implicatures. I have refuted this
analysis by showing the counterexamples in my paper
2001 (in Japanese). The violation of a maxim should be
noticed at the literal level. In my opinion, the utterances
in their examples violate the maxims actually. So I cate-
gorized the cases which they regard as the case of utter-
ance observing all the maxims as the case of violation of
the maxims at the literal level.

cases where the Cooperative Principle is observed
and at least one maxim is not observed. What is
implicated in the case (1) is, for example, that the
speaker doesn’t know the exact time. So this im-
plicature satisfies the maxim of relation, for it
makes the utterance relevant and acceptable by the
hearer. In the case (2), the speaker’s utterance im-
plicates the reason that the speaker doesn’t say
enough. The speaker cannot observe one maxim of
quantity, because if the speaker tried to observe
one maxim of quantity by giving enough informa-
tion, she would violate the maxims of quality, in
the sense that she said what she didn’t know. This
case was called the case of “clash” of the maxims
by Grice.

2.2 Relevance theory

<bodyText confidence="0.999980210526316">
Sperber and Wilson’s relevance theory follows up
Gricean theory, but is different from Gricean the-
ory in the following two senses: first, they don’t
need strong heuristics such as Gricean maxims and
the Cooperative Principle, so they do not have to
assume the violation of the speaker’s utterance
which triggers the inference needed in Grice’s pro-
gram to derive what is unsaid from what is literally
said. Second, their theory, allegedly, can be ap-
plied to all kinds of the ostensive inferences. They
introduced the principle of relevance, which is to
be always observed by participants. In relevance
theory, they treat relevance as a relation between a
proposition P and a set of contextual assumption
{C}. A proposition P is relevant in a context {C} if
and only if P has at least one contextual implica-
tion in {C}. The hearer always assumes that there
is relevance, and tends to extract the maximal in-
ferential effects for the minimal cognitive effort.

3 Capricious transition and misplaced
topics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99215075">
Nevertheless, there are types of utterances which
are neither explained by the theory of Gricean con-
versational implicature nor by the relevance theo-
retic mechanism. We sometimes fail to derive
implicatures, and repeat the utterance to the
speaker or start the conversation over again. These
are the cases of what I name capricious transition
and misplaced topics*2. Illustrations follow:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.945664">
(3) H: Mrs. X is an old bag.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932367088608">
S: The weather has been delightful this
summer, hasn’t it?
In this Grice’s case, the speaker capriciously
changes the topic. I call this case the case of capri-
cious transition. Both Gricean and relevance theo-
ries have proposed theoretical mechanisms with
which to derive the implicature that the speaker
doesn’t want to talk about the matter. But I don’t
think either theory is successful in explaining this
case, because it is possible for the hearer to inter-
pret the utterance differently, for example, as im-
plicating that the speaker doesn’t hear the utterance,
or that she thinks the talk of Mrs. X is over and just
starts the new conversation.
What the speaker says could be interpreted
to observe the Cooperative Principle and all the
maxims, if the hearer doesn’t want the reply to her
utterance “Mrs. X is an old bag.” It may be the
case that the speaker just started a new conversa-
tion, or that the speaker didn’t hear the hearer’s
utterance. Such interpretations are perfectly normal.
In our daily conversations, we hear utterances
made with unexpected change of topics or a new
chunk of conversation starting with a totally new
topic. Apparently, we simply do not derive, in
such cases, implicatures from what is literally said.
This case was explained by Grice as a case
of violation of the maxim of relation. In Gricean
theory, the hearer’s inference is to be triggered by
the violation of the maxim of relation. But this case
of violation of the maxim of relation is different
from the case of violation of other maxims in the
sense that the content of the non-literal meaning
derived by the hearer in this case is neither the fact
2 In the two cases I present here, the speaker&apos;s intention doesn&apos;t
seem important. In Grice&apos;s original theory of meaning, the
speaker&apos;s intention plays an important role in deriving non-
literal meanings. But the hearer cannot know that the non-
literal meaning derived by herself is exactly what the speaker
intends to convey. So it is unneccesary to assume what the
speaker wants to convey for deriving non-literal meanings. In
the actual course of conversations, there is no difference be-
tween the case where the hearer assumes the speaker&apos;s inten-
tion and the case where the hearer doesn&apos;t assume the speaker&apos;s
intention in deriving non-literal meanings. I suspect the con-
cept of the speaker&apos;s intention might be spurious in the theory
of conversational inference.
that the utterance satisfies that maxim which is
violated as in (1), nor the fact that it gives the rea-
son that the speaker’s utterance cannot observe that
maxim which is violated as in (2). This case is
puzzling giving Gricean theory alone.
In relevance theory, on the other hand, it is
by assuming that the proposition expressed or at
least the content of the speaker’s utterance is rele-
vant in the context that the hearer will derive the
non-literal meaning that the speaker doesn’t want
to talk about the subject. But their theory is not
successful in explaining cases where the hearer
interpret that the speaker doesn’t hear the hearer’s
utterance. In relevance theory, the hearer is ex-
pected to tend to extract the maximal effect by the
minimal effort. The hearer, in this case, should
spend more effort until she extracts positive cogni-
tive effects, but when she understands that the
speaker has not heard her utterance, she has to give
up the efforts and extracting effects from what the
speaker literally says, finally to understand that
what the speaker has said has no relevance to the
previous utterance. What is missed in relevance
theoretical mechanism is the criteria that allow the
hearer to stop the effort. If the hearer tried to get
the implicature which is relevant to the previous
utterance at all cost, she could by no means inter-
pret that the speaker didn’t hear the utterance.
The other case which is neither explained
by Gricean theory nor by relevance theory is a case
where we decide not to derive implicature from
what is literally said in the course of conversation.

S: I’ve made a reservation for you.
H2: What? Oh no, I’m talking about the book.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820147058824">
I call this case the case of misplaced topics. In this
case, the hearer thinks that the speaker misplaces
the topic. The hearer stops deriving implicatures
from what is literally said. There is no sense in de-
riving implicatures from what is literally said in
this case because the hearer judges that the topic
the speaker is talking about is different from the
one that the hearer expected. The hearer doesn’t
“infer” the non-literal meanings in terms of
Gricean theory, because she doesn’t suppose any
violation of a maxim. She just tries to let the
speaker focus on the topic she wanted to talk about
by saying H2.
Relevance theory also cannot explain this
case, because there is no relevance in terms of the
principle of relevance. In relevance theory, a
hearer derives utterance meanings assuming that
the proposition expressed is relevant to the context.
But in this case, the hearer can only know that the
speaker is talking about a reservation by the prin-
ciple of relevance. However the hearer may spend
effort to extract the utterance meaning by enriching
or loosening the term a reservation, it is impossi-
ble for the hearer to know that what the speaker
says is out of the context and that the speaker mis-
places the topic. We cannot derive the meaning
that the speaker misplaces the topic from the mean-
ing that the speaker is talking about the reservation.
The relevance theoretic mechanism cannot bridge
the gap between these two meanings. In the case
(4), how can the hearer know that the speaker mis-
places the topic in terms of relevance theory? The
context is given in relevance theory. But in order to
understand that the speaker misplaces the topic in
this case, the hearer has to alter the context.
Moreover, if the hearer’s interpretation in (3)
can be that the speaker doesn’t want to talk about
the subject, then it also can be the hearer’s inter-
pretation in (4). But we don’t think that the inter-
pretation is more appropriate than the
interpretation in which the speaker misplaces the
topic. Even if we take the possibility of contextual
dependence into consideration, the hearer must
give up deriving implicatures at some stage so as
to understand that the speaker has misplaced the
topic. Relevance theorists would say that the hearer
stops conversational inferences when her expecta-
tions of relevance are satisfied. But in the case (4),
the hearer’s expectations of relevance will never be
satisfied, because the hearer has to notice the utter-
ance’s irrelevance to the context so that the hearer
may infer the utterance meaning that the speaker is
saying quite another thing.
The problem in the cases (3) and (4) is how
and why the hearer fails to derive implicatures. As
previously mentioned, there are roughly two types
of implicatures in view of Grice’s notion of ration-
ality. One is telling the hearer something else by
violation; the other is giving the reason that the
speaker cannot observe a certain maxim. But what
the hearer understands in the two cases in question
is neither the satisfying of a maxim nor the giving
of the reason for violation. Rather there is no sense
in assuming what the speaker says observes the
maxims, since what the speaker says in these cases
is beyond the hearer’s expectations. So we have to
examine the mechanism the hearer utilizes in esti-
mating and judging the observance of the maxims.

4 The observance adequacy of the max-
ims
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971656438095238">
I propose to extend Gricean theory by adding the
concept of adequacy of observance of the maxims.
It is beneficial to extend Gricean theory in the fol-
lowing two reasons: firstly, we often need reasons
to explain why we derive a certain implicature. We
have to leave the door open for the possibility of
describing the process of derivation conducted by
the hearer herself, even if the reasons are after-
thoughts and if the process is not exactly what she
has done in her mind at that time. We have to be
responsible for implicatures. Further, relevance
theoretical inferences have the potential of devel-
oping to Gricean theoretical inferences which need
the violation of maxims to be invoked. In the case
(2), the implicature that the speaker doesn’t know
exactly where X lives can be drawn both in
Gricean theory and in relevance theory. So the two
theories are equally able to explain this case. But if
you are asked why you think that the speaker
doesn’t know exactly where X lives, you will ex-
plain the reason in the following manner: the
speaker would say exactly where X lives, if she
knew it, so I infer the meaning that she did not
know. This explanation is based on the hearer’s
assumption that the speaker’s utterance observes
the maxims, in which the conversational inference
is triggered by the violation of a certain maxim at
the literal level. We might not need to assume the
maxims in the course of actual derivation, but we
have to develop the Gricean process which seems
reasonable when we describe it to others.
Secondly, as discussed in Levinson’s work,
there must be the generality of implicatures, that is,
what Grice calls the generalized implicatures. For
example, we generally think that “some” means
“not all” in conversations. Similarly, we generally
think that a certain utterance implicates a certain
implicature, other things being equal. It is plausible,
for example, that “somewhere in the south of
France” in (2) implicates that the speaker doesn’t
know exactly where, unless we assume the context
in which the speaker is not going to cooperate with
the hearer. This assumption of being uncooperative
is not general. Therefore, I would like to construct
my theory on the ground of Gricean theory.
Gricean theory has importance to know what we
think is inference conceptually.
The hearer fails to derive implicatures in the
cases of capricious transition and misplaced topics,
because the hearer doesn’t judge whether the utter-
ance observes the maxims or not, in the same way
as in (1) or (2). What the hearer understands in (3)
and (4) seems to be some sort of implicatures, but
that neither satisfies the maxims nor gives the rea-
son for violation. This kind of utterance meanings
is puzzling, because Gricean maxims are scarcely
able to contribute to the derivation. Therefore, we
have to clarify how we assume the observance of
the maxims.
In the Grice’s program, even in the typical
cases such as (1) and (2), the adequacy of obser-
vance of the maxims is not clear. It is not clear, for
example, to what extent the utterance is informa-
tive, or perspicuous*3. We think that what the
speaker says in (1) is not relevant and not informa-
tive enough intuitively. However, in the case of the
maxims of quantity for example, there is no meas-
ure of “being as informative as is required” and
“not being more informative than is required”. By
whom is it requires to be informative? Of course
by the hearer. The hearer has to have some crite-
rion with which to judge whether the utterance ob-
serves a maxim or not.
According to this criterion of adequacy, the
hearer can notice that there is no sense in assuming
observance of the maxims in (3) and (4). I distin-
guish the two kinds of inferences in relation to this
concept of adequacy of observance of the maxims.
The utterance observes the maxims less adequately,
and the hearer can make use of literal information
and derive implicatures, which satisfies the maxim
that is violated or gives the reason for the violation
by the Gricean way of inferences. I call this type
of inference the hard way. The utterance observes
the maxims beyond the adequate level, the hearer
3 Regarding the adequacy of observance of the maxims, I ha-
ven’t mentioned the observance adequacy of the maxims of
quality because it seems incomprehensible how the hearer
“tries to make her contribution one that is true” adequately,
because we don’t have the notion of being adequately true.
The observance of maxims of quality, however, must have
some connection to that of maxims of quantity. The hearer
wouldn’t care whether surplus information is true or not, for it
is not necessary. We need more detailed argument on this
issue, so I refrain from discussing it in this paper.
cannot make use of literal information for deriva-
tion, so the inference by the hard way will break
down. Then the hearer will suppose that the
speaker doesn’t participate in the conversation, or
that she has not heard the hearer’s utterance. This
type of inference I call the easy way. After I ex-
plain the hard way and the easy way inferences, I
will show the connection between the adequacy of
observance of the maxims and the two ways of
inferences.

5 The hard way and the easy way
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953181818182">
I introduce the dichotomy of conversational infer-
ences: the hard way and the easy way. The dichot-
omy is justified by Grice’s discussion in “Aspects
of reason,” where he distinguishes “the hard way”
from “the quick way.” The dichotomy proposed
here is not the same as the distinction between
Grice’s two types of inference, and, in particular,
the easy way described below is different from
what Grice called the quick way. Grice’s quick
way is “a substitute for the hard way, which is
made possible by the habituation and intention”.
But my easy way is not a substitute for the hard
way but it is a different kind of inference than the
hard way. The best part of the non-literal meanings
Grice explained successfully is the inference by the
hard way, namely the inference that derives con-
versational implicature. Part of the easy way in-
ferences are those inferences discussed
successfully by relevance theory, which fails to
describe the important subset of the easy way in-
ference that take place in the cases of misplaced
topics and capricious transition.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995755">
5.1 The hard way
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997325581395">
The inference by the hard way is to make the utter-
ance acceptable and understandable by the hearer
by deriving utterance meanings from what the
speaker literally says. This type of inference has
been familiar to us since Grice’s Harvard lectures.
I view this way of inference as derivation by way
of literal input. In other words, the hearer makes
use of the proposition expressed at the literal level
in order to derive implicatures. The hearer judges
that the utterance doesn’t observe a certain maxim,
and starts to infer non-literal meanings. In the
cases of the maxims of quantity or the maxim of
relation, the utterance gives the hearer less infor-
mation, or less great relevance than the hearer re-
quires, but there remains something that the hearer
can make use of. The cases (1) and (2) exemplify
this type. The hearer derives implicatures that it
satisfies the maxim which is violated, or gives the
reason for the violation at the literal level.
In the cases (3) and (4), the hearer cannot
derive implicatures by the hard way. When the lit-
eral meanings are useless for derivation, or when
the hearer can get only useless consequences, the
hearer fails to derive implicatures by the hard way.
For instance, the hearer will say “What?” to the
previous speaker to indicate that she has failed to
derive useful implicatures, or she will start the
conversation over again. The case of misplaced
topics is explained as a failure of the hard way,
when the hearer says “what?” to indicate that she
did hear what the speaker says but couldn’t under-
stand it. In the case (4), the hearer cannot derive
useful implicature, so she indicates that she hasn’t
understood what the speaker says on the assump-
tion that the utterance observes the maxims. Then
she retries conversation. Thus, given the notion of
a failure of the hard way, the case of non-
understandings can be explained in the theory of
conversational inferences. In the case (4), the
hearer starts to envisage why she doesn’t under-
stand the speaker’s utterance. I would say that the
non-literal meaning that the speaker must have
misplaced the topic is derived by the easy way.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99889">
5.2 The easy way
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971021897435898">
The easy way inferences are less effort demanding,
need fewer steps than the hard way inferences. In
the easy way inferences, we normally have two
steps alone: the literal input and the non-literal
output, and that’s it. Even the speaker’s emotions
could be taken as utterance meanings, as in the
case where the speaker doesn’t want to talk about
the subject. The typical example is the case of ca-
pricious transition. The following example beauti-
fully illustrates the easy way inference:
(5) H: I finished writing that story and it’s going
to be published.
S: When?
The gloss of what the speaker says could be either
of the following two interpretations: “when did
you finish writing that story?” or “when is it going
to be published?” The selection one of these two
interpretations is by the easy way. The hearer uses
the literal input, “when,” in the process of extract-
ing the potential interpretations, but the literal in-
put is not informative enough to justify the
selection of one or the other. There is no decisive
factor so that the hearer is free to take whichever
she likes. The hearer doesn’t need to have reasons
for deriving utterance meanings on the ground of
the violation of a certain maxim, but just connects
what the speaker says with whatever the hearer
understands. The hearer can derive what is sup-
posed to be implicated from what is literally said
directly without using the literal input as indicates
the violation of a maxim.
5.3 The connection between the adequacy and
the two ways of inferences
There is a reason for having two kinds of inference
rather than one uniform kind. It depends on the
observance adequacy which the hearer expects. If
what the speaker says observes the Cooperative
Principle and some of the maxims, her contribution
is, for example, less informative, or less relevant.
But there remains something we can make use of
for derivation, because the information or the rele-
vance is not zero. If what the speaker says doesn’t
seem to observe any of the maxims, or what the
speaker says doesn’t seem to have any connection
with the previous utterance, then the speaker’s con-
tribution conveys no information, or bears no rele-
vance. So we cannot make inferential steps using
the literal input in the same way as the hard way.
Then we connect the input with the output directly.
But we should note that a failure of the hard way
doesn’t always make us shift to the easy way. It is
likely, in some cases, first to fail by the hard way
and then to try deriving an utterance meaning by
the easy way. But the hard way process doesn’t
precede the easy way process theoretically, and
vice versa. The choice of process depends on the
hearer, and thus the theory has to be based on the
dichotomy of conversational inferences.
Now there are five cases an inference-
based theory of language understanding has to give
an account of. They are
[1] the case of the literal meaning understood liter-
ally
[2] the case of the typical Gricean conversational
implicature
[3] the case of regular relevance theoretic inference
[4] the case of capricious transition
[5] the case of misplaced topic
The inferential process for the regular
Gricean conversational implicature can be de-
scribed as follows: The hearer gets what is literally
said, and measures the adequacy of observance,
and if the utterance observes the maxims less than
adequately, then the hearer starts the hard way in-
ference on the assumption that the speaker’s con-
tribution is rationally acceptable, and derives
implicatures.
The inferential process for the regular rele-
vance theoretical mechanism can be described as
follows: the hearer gets what is literally said, and
measures the adequacy of observance of the max-
ims. If the hearer wants to derive utterance mean-
ings further by enriching what is literally said, on
the assumption that the utterance is relevant in the
context, in spite of the utterance observing the Co-
operative Principle and all the maxims*4, then the
hearer starts the easy way inference and derives
implicatures. In a case which is similar to (5) but
which offers only one option on condition that the
utterance is relevant to the given context, the
hearer derives utterance meanings by the same way
as the relevance theoretic inference which I sub-
sume under the category that is I call the easy way.
Now when the hearer fails to derive impli-
catures by the hard way, she will start the conver-
sation over again. It is the case of a failure of the
hard way inference when the hearer doesn’t notice
that the topic of the speaker’s utterance is different
from the one the hearer expected and says “what?”
to the speaker. That is the case (5) of misplaced
topics.
And it is by the easy way that the hearer
comes to know that the speaker misplaces the topic.
The hearer gets what is literally said, and measures
the adequacy of observance of the maxims, and if
the utterance is far from being adequately obser-
vant of the maxims, then the hearer starts the easy
way inference and derives implicatures. The infer-
ences in this case can be based on anything, for
example, the hearer’s frame of mind. The case of
capricious transition (4) is of this type. Utterances
to start and to change the topic are classified in this
type, though the existent theories have not given
4 I suppose that what the hearer understands in the case where
the utterance observes the Cooperative Principle and all the
maxims includes explicatures in the sense of relevance theory.
any theoretical status to this type of utterances.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993351586206897">
On the basis of the concept of rational acceptance
in conversations, I have extended Gricean theory
by adding the concept of observance adequacy of
the maxims, and have defined two distinct types of
inference in terms of the concept of observance
adequacy. Hearers derive utterance meanings in
different ways based on the different level of ade-
quacy of observance of the maxims measured. The
extended Gricean theory now can describe all ways
the hearer derives utterance meanings in all cases.
The relations between different kind of inferences
and their coverage are shown in Fig 1.
We still have four more problems to really
complete the theory of conversational inferences.
1) We need to give more consideration to the na-
ture of those inferences. Specifically, we have to
justify the assertion that the easy way inference is
an inference, because it seems to be different in
nature from inferences Gricean theorists have
thought of.
2) I have not distinguished implicatures from what
the hearer understands explicitly. I surmise that, at
the level of derivation, failing to understand the
speaker and assuming the reason for non-
understanding are different (such as assuming that
the speaker misplaces the topic, which would make
the hearer retry the conversation). I suspect the
latter will be explained as a kind of meta-level in-
ference, but we need more arguments and evidence.
3) The notion of “being rational” should be studied
further. It is not clear what Grice meant by saying
that the derivation in interpreting utterance mean-
ings is a rational activity. We have to know a sort
of measure or extent of being rational. Theoreti-
cally, anything goes by the easy way inference. But
we would reject some interpretation because it be-
ing too hard to justify. It would be an important
issue in the general theory of conversational infer-
ence to characterize the mechanism the hearer uses
in keeping herself from not drawing too inappro-
priate utterance meanings.
4) The solution I provide in this argument is not
fully formalized yet. I suspect one possible formal-
ization can be given by using the DRT by treating
the cases of misplaced topics and capricious transi-
tion in terms of inaccessibility in the DRT, al-
though further independently motivated
elaboration is necessary in the theory to formalize
the case of being inaccessible. As far as I know, I
don&apos;t know that the DRT can formalize the case of
being inaccessible well, for example, when a pro-
noun has no referent in any previous discourses. In
such cases the sentence in question might seem to
be ungrammatical, or at least not understandable
unanimously, but in the two cases I have presented,
the hearer notices that the speaker refers to the
other referent than the one the hearer wants to refer
to.
