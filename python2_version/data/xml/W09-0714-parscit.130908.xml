This paper investigates the possibilities that
cross-linguistic similarities and dissimilarities
between related languages offer in terms of
bootstrapping a morphological analyser. In
this case an existing Zulu morphological ana-
lyser prototype (ZulMorph) serves as basis
for a Xhosa analyser. The investigation is
structured around the morphotactics and the
morphophonological alternations of the lan-
guages involved. Special attention is given to
the so-called “open” class, which represents
the word root lexicons for specifically nouns
and verbs. The acquisition and coverage of
these lexicons prove to be crucial for the suc-
cess of the analysers under development.
The bootstrapped morphological analyser is
applied to parallel test corpora and the results
are discussed. A variety of cross-linguistic ef-
fects is illustrated with examples from the
corpora. It is found that bootstrapping mor-
phological analysers for languages that ex-
hibit significant structural and lexical simi-
larities may be fruitfully exploited for devel-
oping analysers for lesser-resourced lan-
guages.

<bodyText confidence="0.9973995">
Zulu and Xhosa belong to the Nguni languages, a
group of languages from the South-eastern Bantu
zone and, as two of the eleven official languages
of South Africa, are spoken by approximately 9
and 8 million mother-tongue speakers, respec-
tively. In terms of natural language processing,
particularly computational morphology, the
Bantu languages including Zulu and Xhosa cer-
tainly belong to the lesser-studied languages of
the world.
One of the few Bantu languages for which
computational morphological analysers have
been fully developed so far is Swahili (Hur-
skainen, 1992; De Pauw and De Schryver, 2008).

A computational morphological analyser proto-
type for Zulu (ZulMorph) is in an advanced
stage of development, the results of which have
already been used in other applications. Prelimi-
nary experiments and results towards obtaining
morphological analysers for Xhosa, Swati and
Ndebele by bootstrapping ZulMorph were par-
ticularly encouraging (Bosch et al., 2008). This
bootstrapping process may be briefly summa-
rised as a sequence of steps in which the baseline
analyser, ZulMorph, is applied to the new lan-
guage (in this case Xhosa) and then systemati-
cally extended to include the morphology of the
other language. The extensions concern the word
root lexicon, followed by the grammatical mor-
pheme lexicons and finally by the appropriate
morphophonological rules. The guiding principle
in this process is as follows: Use the Zulu mor-
phological structure wherever applicable and
only extend the analyser to accommodate differ-
ences between the source language (Zulu) and
the target language (in this case Xhosa). So far
the question as to whether the bootstrapped ana-
lyser, extended to include Xhosa morphology,
could also improve the coverage of the Zulu ana-
lyser was not specifically addressed in Bosch et
al. (2008).
Cross-linguistic similarity and its exploitation
is a rather wide concept. In its broadest sense it
aims at investigating and developing resources
and technologies that can be compared and
linked, used and analysed with common ap-
proaches, and that contain linguistic information
for the same or comparable phenomena. In this
paper the focus is on the morphological similari-
ties and dissimilarities between Zulu and Xhosa
and how these cross-linguistic similarities and
dissimilarities inform the bootstrapping of a
morphological analyser for Zulu and Xhosa. In
particular, issues such as open versus closed
classes, and language specific morphotactics and
alternation rules are discussed. Special attention

the procedure for bootstrapping is broadened to
include a guesser variant of the morphological
analyser.

discussed. This is followed in sections 3 and 4 by
a systematic exposition of the cross-linguistic
dissimilarities pertaining to morphotactics and
morphophonological alternations. Section 5 fo-

nouns and verbs. The acquisition and coverage of
these lexicons prove to be crucial for the success
of the analysers under development. Section 6
addresses the use of the guesser variant of the

of the bootstrapped morphological analyser to

tigation and exploitation of cross-linguistic simi-
larities and their significance for bootstrapping
purposes. Section 7 concerns future work and a

2.1 Morphological structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993967275862069">
Bantu languages are characterised by a rich ag-
glutinating morphological structure, based on
two principles, namely the nominal classification
system, and the concordial agreement system.
According to the nominal classification system,
nouns are categorised by prefixal morphemes.
These noun prefixes have, for ease of analysis,
been assigned numbers by scholars who have
worked within the field of Bantu linguistics, In
Zulu a noun such as umuntu &apos;person&apos; for instance,
consists of a noun prefix umu- followed by the
noun stem -ntu and is classified as a class 1
noun, while the noun isitha &apos;rival&apos; consists of a
noun prefix isi- and the noun stem -tha and is
classified as a class 7 noun. Noun prefixes gen-
erally indicate number, with the uneven class
numbers designating singular and the corre-
sponding even class numbers designating plural.
The plural forms of the above examples would
therefore respectively be the class 2 noun abantu
&apos;persons&apos; and the class 8 noun izitha &apos;rivals&apos;. We
follow Meinhof&apos;s (1932:48) numbering system
which distinguishes between 23 noun prefixes
altogether in the various Bantu languages.
The concordial agreement system is signifi-
cant in the Bantu languages because it forms the
backbone of the whole sentence structure. Con-
cordial agreement is brought about by the vari-
ous noun classes in the sense that their prefixes
link the noun to other words in the sentence. This
linking is manifested by a concordial morpheme
that is derived from the noun prefix, and usually
bears a close resemblance to the noun prefix, as
illustrated in the following example:
Izitsha lezi ezine zephukile
‘These four plates are broken’
This concordial agreement system governs
grammatical correlation in verbs, adjectives, pos-
sessives, pronouns, and so forth. Bantu lan-
guages are predominantly agglutinating and po-
lymorphematic in nature, with affixes attached to
the root or core of the word.
The morphological make-up of the verb is
considerably more complex than that of the
noun. A number of slots, both preceding and fol-
lowing the verb root may contain numerous
morphemes with functions such as derivations,
inflection for tense-aspect and marking of nomi-
nal arguments. Examples are cross-reference of
the subject and object by means of class- (or per-
son-/number-)specific object markers, locative
affixes, morphemes distinguishing verb forms in
clause-final and non-final position, negation etc.
Despite the complexities of these domains,
they are comparable across language boundaries,
specifically Nguni language boundaries, with a
degree of formal similarity that lends itself to
exploitation for bootstrapping purposes.

2.2 Modelling and Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976052631579">
In the modelling and implementation of the mor-
phological structure a finite-state approach is
followed. The suitability of finite-state ap-
proaches to computational morphology is well
known and has resulted in numerous software
toolkits and development environments for this
purpose (cf. Koskenniemi, 1997 and Karttunen,
2001). Yli-Jyrä (2005) discusses the importance
of a finite-state morphology toolkit for lesser-
studies languages. He maintains that “[a]lthough
some lexicons and morphological grammars can
be learned automatically from texts ... fully
automatic or unsupervised methods are not suffi-
cient. This is due to two reasons. First, the
amount of freely available corpora is limited for
many of the less studied languages. Second,
many of the less studied languages have rich
morphologies that are difficult to learn accurately
with unsupervised methods”.

The Xerox finite-state tools (Beesley and
Karttunen, 2003) as one of the preferred toolkits
for modelling and implementing natural lan-
guage morphology, is used in this work.
The morphological challenges in computa-
tional morphological analysis comprise the mod-
elling of two general linguistic components,
namely morphotactics (word formation rules) as
well as morphophonological alternations.
Ideally, the morphotactics component should
include all and only word roots in the language,
all and only the affixes for all parts-of-speech
(word categories) as well as a complete descrip-
tion of the valid combinations and orders of these
morphemes for forming all and only the words of
the language concerned. Moreover, the morpho-
phonological alternations rules should constitute
all known sound changes that occur at morpheme
boundaries. The combination of these two com-
ponents constitutes an accurate model of the
morphology of the language(s) under considera-
tion.
The Xerox lexicon compiler, lexc, is well-
suited to capturing the morphotactics of Zulu. A
lexc script, consisting of cascades of so-called
continuation classes (of morpheme lexicons) rep-
resenting the (concatenative) morpheme se-
quencing, is compiled into a finite-state network.
The Xerox regular expression language, xfst,
provides an extended regular expression calculus
with sophisticated Replace Rules for describing
the morphophonological alternations rules of
Zulu. The xfst script is also compiled into a fi-
nite-state network. These networks are finally
combined by means of the operation of composi-
tion into a so-called Lexical Transducer that con-
stitutes the morphological analyser and contains
all the morphological information of Zulu, in-
cluding derivation, inflection, alternation and
compounding. Pretorius and Bosch (2002) ad-
dress the suitability of this approach to Zulu
morphology and illustrate it by means of exam-
ples of lexc and xfst scripts for modelling the
Zulu noun.
A detailed exposition of the design and im-
plementation of ZulMorph may be found in Pre-
torius and Bosch (2003). In addition to consider-
ing both the accurate modelling of the morpho-
tactics and the morphophonological alternation
rules, they also address implementation and other
issues that need to be resolved in order to pro-
duce a useful software artefact for automated
morphological analysis. Issues of implementa-
tion include a justification for the finite-state ap-
proach followed, designing for accuracy and cor-
rectness and decisions regarding the analyser&apos;s
interface with its environment and its usage.
Particular attention is paid to the handling of
exceptions; the modelling of separated depend-
encies by means of so-called flag-diacritics; the
specification of lexical forms (analyses) in terms
of morphological granularity and feature infor-
mation; the choice of an associated and appropri-
ate morphological tag set and also the position-
ing of these tags in relation to the morphemes
they are associated with in the morphological
analyses (lexical forms) that are rendered.
The components of ZulMorph, including its
scope in terms of word categories and their mor-
phological structure, are summarised in Table 1
while its lexical coverage as reflected by the
number of different noun stems, verb roots etc. is
discussed in section 5.
The bootstrapping of ZulMorph to provide
for Xhosa as well requires a careful investigation
of the cross-linguistic similarities and dissimi-
larities and how they are best modelled and im-
plemented. This aspect will be discussed in more
detail in the following section.

In word formation we distinguish between so-
called closed and open classes. The open class
accepts the addition of new items by means of
processes such as borrowing, coining, com-
pounding and derivation. In the context of this
paper, the open class represents word roots in-
cluding verb roots and noun stems. The closed
class represents affixes that model the fixed
morphological structure of words, as well as
items such as conjunctions, pronouns etc. Typi-
cally no new items can be added to the closed
class (Fromkin et al., 2003:74).
Since our point of departure is ZulMorph, we
focus on Xhosa affixes that differ from their Zulu

Locative demonstrative copulatives : Three positional types of the so-called locative demonstrative copulatives differ considerably for
Zulu and Xhosa and are therefore listed separately for each language. Examples:
Class 1 Pos. 1 nangu; Pos. 2 nango; Pos. 3 nanguya Pos. 1 nanku; Pos. 2 nanko; Pos. 3 nankuya
Class 5 Pos. 1 nanti; Pos. 2 nanto; Pos. 3 nantiya Pos. 1 nali; Pos. 2 nalo; Pos. 3 naliya
Copulatives : Formation of copulatives derived from Xhosa nouns differs considerably from Zulu. This construction is class dependent
in Xhosa and is modelled differently to its Zulu counterpart. Examples:
yi- combines with noun prefixes i-: ngu- combines with classes 1, 1a, 2, 2a, 3 &amp;
yi-indoda &gt; yindoda 6, e.g. ngu-umntu &gt; ngumntu

analyser, for instance the formation of the so-
called temporal form that does not occur in Zulu.
The temporal form is an indication of when an
action takes place or when a process is carried
out, and has a present or past tense form (Louw,
et al., 1984:163). The simple form consists of a
subject concord plus -a- followed by the verb
stem in the infinitive, the preprefix of which has
been elided, for example si-a-uku-buya &gt; sa-
kubuya ‘when we return’. In terms of the word
formation rules this means that an additional
Xhosa specific morpheme lexicon (continuation
class) needs to be included. To facilitate accurate
modelling appropriate constraints also need to be
formulated.
The bootstrapping process is iterative and new
information regarding dissimilar morphological
constructions is incorporated systematically in

the morphotactics component. Similarly, rules
are adapted in a systematic manner. The process
also inherently relies on similarities between the
languages, and therefore the challenge is to
model the dissimilarities accurately. The care-
fully conceptualised and appropriately structured
(lexc) continuation classes embodying the Zulu
morphotactics provide a suitable framework for
including all the closed class dissimilarities dis-
cussed above.

Differences in morphophonological alternations
between Zulu and Xhosa are exemplified in Ta-

Others are found in instances of palatalisation, “a
sound change whereby a bilabial sound in pas-

formation is replaced by a palatal sound” (Poulos

As before, the Zulu alternations are assumed
to apply to Xhosa unless otherwise modelled.
Regarding language-specific alternations special
care is taken to ensure that the rules fire only in
the desired contexts and order. For example,
Xhosa-specific sound changes should not fire
between Zulu-specific morphemes, and vice
versa. This applies, for instance, to the vowel
combination ii, which does not occur in Zulu.
While the general rule ii &gt; i holds for Zulu, the
vowel combination ii needs to be preserved in
Xhosa.

5 The word root lexicons
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999075931818182">
Compiling sufficiently extensive and complete
word root lexicons (i.e. populating the “open”
word classes) is a major challenge, particularly
for lesser-resourced languages (Yli-Jyrä,
2005:2). A pragmatic approach of harvesting
roots from all readily available sources is fol-
lowed. The Zulu lexicon is based on an extensive
word list dating back to the mid 1950s (cf. Doke
and Vilakazi, 1964), but significant improve-
ments and additions are regularly made. At pre-
sent the Zulu word roots include noun stems with
class information (15 759), verb roots (7 567),
relative stems (406), adjective stems (48), ideo-
phones (1 360), conjunctions (176). Noun stems
with class information (4 959) and verb roots (5
984) for the Xhosa lexicon were extracted from
various recent prototype paper dictionaries
whereas relative stems (27), adjective stems (17),
ideophones (30) and conjunctions (28) were only
included as representative samples at this stage.
The most obvious difference between the two
word root lexicons is the sparse coverage of
nouns for Xhosa. A typical shortcoming in the
current Xhosa lexicon is limited class informa-
tion for noun stems.
Observations are firstly occurrences of shared
noun stems (mainly loan words) but different
class information, typically class 5/6 for Zulu
versus class 9/10 for Xhosa, for example
‘box’ -bhokisi (Xhosa 9/10; Zulu 5/6)
‘duster’ -dasta (Xhosa 9/10; Zulu 5/6)
‘pinafore’ -fasikoti (Xhosa 9/10; Zulu 5/6).
It should be noted that although a Xhosa noun
stem may be identical to its Zulu counterpart,
analysis is not possible if the class prefix differs
from the specified Zulu class prefix + noun stem
combination in the morphotactics component of
the analyser.
A second observation is identical noun stems
with correct class information, valid for both
languages, but so far only appearing in the Xhosa
lexicon, for example
‘number’ -namba (Xhosa and Zulu 9/10)
‘dice’-dayisi (Xhosa and Zulu 5/6).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.983277">
100
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999255">
This phenomenon occurs mainly with bor-
rowed nouns that are more prevalent in the
Xhosa lexicon than in the more outdated Zulu
lexicon.
A closer look at the contents of the lexicons
reveals that the two languages have the following
in common: 1027 noun stems with corresponding
class information, 1722 verb roots, 20 relative
stems, 11 adjective stems, 10 ideophones and 9
conjunctions.

This section discusses the extension of the boot-
strapping procedure of the morphological ana-
lyser to include the use of the guesser variant of
the morphological analyser. In addition the ap-
plication of the bootstrapped morphological ana-
lyser to parallel test corpora is addressed. A vari-
ety of cross-linguistic effects is illustrated with
examples from the corpora.
Even in languages where extensive word root
lexicons are available, new word roots may occur
from time to time. The Xerox toolkit makes pro-
vision for a guesser variant of the morphologi-
cal analyser that uses typical word root patterns
for identifying potential new word roots (Beesley
and Karttunen, 2003:444). By exploiting the
morphotactics and morphophonological alterna-
tions of the analyser prototype, the guesser is
able to analyse morphologically valid words of
which the roots match the specified pattern.
Therefore, in cases where both the Zulu and
Xhosa word root lexicons do not contain a root,
the guesser may facilitate the bootstrapping
process.
The extended bootstrapping procedure is
schematically represented in Figure 1.
Since the available Zulu word list represents a
rather outdated vocabulary, it is to be expected
that the coverage of word roots/stems from a re-
cent corpus of running Zulu text may be unsatis-
factory, due to the dynamic nature of language.
For example the word list contains no entry of
the loan word utoliki ‘interpreter’ since ‘inter-
preter’ is rendered only as i(li)humusha ‘transla-
tor’, the traditional term derived from the verb
stem –humusha ‘to translate, interpret’. Provi-
sion therefore needs to be made for the constant
inclusion of new roots/stems, be they newly
coined, compounds or as yet unlisted foreign
roots/stems.
Updating and refining the lexicon requires the
availability of current and contemporary

language resources in the form of text cor-

of expert lexicographers or linguists to deter-
mine the eligibility of such words.
The language resources chosen to illustrate
this point are parallel corpora in the form of the
South African Constitution (The Constitution,

that they are easily accessible on-line, and it is

simply do not match the word root patterns as

In this paper we focused on two aspects of
cross-linguistic similarity between Zulu and
Xhosa, namely the morphological structure
(morphotactics and alternation rules) and the
word root lexicons.
Regarding the morphological structure only
differences between Zulu and Xhosa were added.

<bodyText confidence="0.999986617647059">
Therefore, Zulu informed Xhosa in the sense that
the systematically developed grammar for Zul-
Morph was directly available for the Xhosa ana-
lyser development, which significantly reduced
the development time for the Xhosa prototype
compared to that for ZulMorph.
Special attention was also given to the so-
called “open” class, which represents the word
root lexicons for specifically nouns and verbs.
The acquisition and coverage of these lexicons
proved to be crucial for the success of the ana-
lysers under development. Since we were fortu-
nate in having access to word root lexicons for
both Zulu and Xhosa we included what was
available in such a way that word roots could be
shared between the languages. Here, although to
a lesser extent, Xhosa also informed Zulu by
providing a current (more up to date) Xhosa lexi-
con. In addition, the guesser variant was em-
ployed in identifying possible new roots in the
test corpora, both for Zulu and for Xhosa.
In general it is concluded that bootstrapping
morphological analysers for languages that ex-
hibit significant structural and lexical similarities
may be fruitfully exploited for developing ana-
lysers for lesser-resourced languages.
Future work includes the application of the
approach followed in this work to the other
Nguni languages, namely Swati and Ndebele
(Southern and Zimbabwe); the application to lar-
ger corpora, and the subsequent construction of
stand-alone versions. Finally, the combined ana-
lyser could also be used for (corpus-based) quan-
titative studies in cross-linguistic similarity.

In this case an existing Zulu morphological anaprototype serves as basis for a Xhosa analyser. The investigation is structured around the morphotactics and the morphophonological alternations of the languages involved. Special attention is given to the so-called “open” class, which represents the word root lexicons for specifically nouns and verbs. The acquisition and coverage of these lexicons prove to be crucial for the success of the analysers under development. The bootstrapped morphological analyser is applied to parallel test corpora and the results are discussed. A variety of cross-linguistic effects is illustrated with examples from the corpora. It is found that bootstrapping morphological analysers for languages that exhibit significant structural and lexical similarities may be fruitfully exploited for developing analysers for lesser-resourced languages.</abstract>

Yli-Jyrä (2005) discusses the importance of a finite-state morphology toolkit for lesserstudies languages.

This is due to two reasons. First, the amount of freely available corpora is limited for many of the less studied languages. Second, many of the less studied languages have rich morphologies that are difficult to learn accurately with unsupervised methods”. 97 The Xerox finite-state tools (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) as one of the preferred toolkits for modelling and implementing natural language morphology, is used in this work. The morphological challenges in computational morphological analysis comprise the modelling of two general linguistic components, namely morphotactics (word formation rules) as well as morphophonological alternations. Ideally, the morphotactics component should include all and only word roots in the language, all and only the affixes for all parts-of-speech (word categories) as well as a complete description of the valid combinations and orders of these morphemes for forming all </context>

In addition the application of the bootstrapped morphological analyser to parallel test corpora is addressed. A variety of cross-linguistic effects is illustrated with examples from the corpora. Even in languages where extensive word root lexicons are available, new word roots may occur from time to time. The Xerox toolkit makes provision for a guesser variant of the morphological analyser that uses typical word root patterns for identifying potential new word roots (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003:444). By exploiting the morphotactics and morphophonological alternations of the analyser prototype, the guesser is able to analyse morphologically valid words of which the roots match the specified pattern. Therefore, in cases where both the Zulu and Xhosa word root lexicons do not contain a root, the guesser may facilitate the bootstrapping process. The extended bootstrapping procedure is schematically represented in Figure 1. Since the available Zulu word list represents a rather outdated vocabulary, it is to be expected that the coverage of word roots/stems from a recent corpus of running</context>

Preliminary experiments and results towards obtaining morphological analysers for Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele by bootstrapping ZulMorph were particularly encouraging (Bosch et al., 2008). This bootstrapping process may be briefly summarised as a sequence of steps in which the baseline analyser, ZulMorph, is applied to the new language (in this case Xhosa) and then systematically extended to include the morphology of the other language. The extensions concern the word root lexicon, followed by the grammatical morpheme lexicons and finally by the appropriate morphophonological rules.

This applies, for instance, to the vowel combination ii, which does not occur in Zulu. While the general rule ii &gt; i holds for Zulu, the vowel combination ii needs to be preserved in Xhosa. 5 The word root lexicons Compiling sufficiently extensive and complete word root lexicons (i.e. populating the “open” word classes) is a major challenge, particularly for lesser-resourced languages (Yli-Jyrä, 2005:2). A pragmatic approach of harvesting roots from all readily available sources is followed. The Zulu lexicon is based on an extensive word list dating back to the mid 1950s (cf. Doke and Vilakazi, 1964), but significant improvements and additions are regularly made. At present the Zulu word roots include noun stems with class information (15 759), verb roots (7 567), relative stems (406), adjective stems (48), ideophones (1 360), conjunctions (176). Noun stems with class information (4 959) and verb roots (5 984) for the Xhosa lexicon were extracted from various recent prototype paper dictionaries whereas relative stems (27), adjective stems (17), ideophones (30) and conjunctions (28) were only included as representative samples at this stage.

Some occur in noun class prefixes of class 10 and associated constructions, such as prefixing of adverbial morphemes (na-, nga-, etc.). Others are found in instances of palatalisation, “a sound change whereby a bilabial sound in passive formation, locativisation and diminutive formation is replaced by a palatal sound” (Poulos and Msimang, 1998:531). Zulu Xhosa Class 10 class prefix izin- occurs before monosyllabic as well Class 10 class prefix izin- changes to iin- before polysyllabic stems, as polysyllabic stems, e.g. izinja, izindlebe e.g. izinja, iindlebe Adverb prefix na + i &gt; ne, e.g. nezindlebe (na-izin-ndlebe) Adverb prefix na + ii &gt; nee; e.g. neendlebe (na-iin-ndlebe) Palatalisation with passive, diminutive &amp; locative formation: Palatalisation with passive, diminutive &amp; locative formation: b &gt; tsh b &gt; ty -hlab-w-a &gt; -hlatsh-w-a, intaba-ana &gt; intatsh-ana, -hlab-w-a &gt; -hlaty-w-a, intaba-ana &gt; intaty-a na indaba &gt; entdatsheni </context>

The extensions concern the word root lexicon, followed by the grammatical morpheme lexicons and finally by the appropriate morphophonological rules. The guiding principle in this process is as follows: Use the Zulu morphological structure wherever applicable and only extend the analyser to accommodate differences between the source language (Zulu) and the target language (in this case Xhosa). So far the question as to whether the bootstrapped analyser, extended to include Xhosa morphology, could also improve the coverage of the Zulu analyser was not specifically addressed in Bosch et al. (2008). Cross-linguistic similarity and its exploitation is a rather wide concept. In its broadest sense it aims at investigating and developing resources and technologies that can be compared and linked, used and analysed with common approaches, and that contain linguistic information for the same or comparable phenomena. In this paper the focus is on the morphological similarities and dissimilarities between Zulu and Xhosa and how these cross-linguistic similarities and dissimilarities inform the bootstrapping of a morphological analyser for Zulu and Xhosa. In particular, issues such as open versu</context>

The suitability of finite-state approaches to computational morphology is well known and has resulted in numerous software toolkits and development environments for this purpose (cf. Koskenniemi, 1997 and Karttunen, 2001). Yli-Jyrä (2005) discusses the importance of a finite-state morphology toolkit for lesserstudies languages. He maintains that “[a]lthough some lexicons and morphological grammars can be learned automatically from texts ... fully automatic or unsupervised methods are not sufficient. This is due to two reasons. First, the amount of freely available corpora is limited for many of the less studied languages. Second, many of the less studied languages have rich morphologies that are difficult to learn accurately with unsupervised methods”. 97 The Xerox finite-state tools (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) as one of the</context>

For example, Xhosa-specific sound changes should not fire between Zulu-specific morphemes, and vice versa. This applies, for instance, to the vowel combination ii, which does not occur in Zulu. While the general rule ii &gt; i holds for Zulu, the vowel combination ii needs to be preserved in Xhosa. 5 The word root lexicons Compiling sufficiently extensive and complete word root lexicons (i.e. populating the “open” word classes) is a major challenge, particularly for lesser-resourced languages (Yli-Jyrä, 2005:2). A pragmatic approach of harvesting roots from all readily available sources is followed. The Zulu lexicon is based on an extensive word list dating back to the mid 1950s (cf. Doke and Vilakazi, 1964), but significant improvements and additions are regularly made. At present the Zulu word roots include noun stems with class information (15 759), verb roots (7 567), relative stems (406), adjective stems (48), ideophones (1 360), conjunctions (176). Noun stems with class information (4 959) and verb roots (5 984) for the Xhosa lexicon were extracted from various recent prototype paper dictio</context>
