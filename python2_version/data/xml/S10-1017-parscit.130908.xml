This paper describes the participation
of RelaxCor in the Semeval-2010 task
number 1: “Coreference Resolution in
Multiple Languages“. RelaxCor is a
constraint-based graph partitioning ap-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945666666667">
The Semeval-2010 task is concerned with intra-
document coreference resolution for six different
languages: Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Ital-
ian and Spanish. The core of the task is to iden-
tify which noun phrases (NPs) in a text refer to the
same discourse entity (Recasens et al., 2010).
RelaxCor (Sapena et al., 2010) is a graph rep-
resentation of the problem solved by a relaxation
labeling process, reducing coreference resolution
to a graph partitioning problem given a set of con-
straints. In this manner, decisions are taken con-
sidering the whole set of mentions, ensuring con-
sistency and avoiding that classification decisions
are independently taken.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de-
scribes RelaxCor, the system used in the Semeval
task. Next, Section 3 describes the tuning needed
by the system to adapt it to different languages and
other task issues. The same section also analyzes
the obtained results. Finally, Section 4 concludes
the paper.

This section briefly describes RelaxCor. First, the
graph representation is presented. Next, there is
an explanation of the methodology used to learn
constraints and train the system. Finally, the algo-
rithm used for resolution is described.

2.1 Problem Representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999819357142857">
Let G = G(V, E) be an undirected graph where V
is a set of vertices and E a set of edges. Let m =
(mi, ..., mn) be the set of mentions of a document
with n mentions to resolve. Each mention mi in
the document is represented as a vertex vi E V
in the graph. An edge eij E E is added to the
graph for pairs of vertices (vi, vj) representing the
possibility that both mentions corefer.
Let C be our set of constraints. Given a pair of
mentions (mi, mj), a subset of constraints Cij C
C restrict the compatibility of both mentions. Cij
is used to compute the weight value of the edge
connecting vi and vj. Let wij E W be the weight
of the edge eij:

<equation confidence="0.956542">
11 wij = Akfk(mi, mj) (1)

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9913218">
where fk(·) is a function that evaluates the con-
straint k and Ak is the weight associated to the
constraint. Note that Ak and wij can be negative.
In our approach, each vertex (vi) in the graph
is a variable (vi) for the algorithm. Let Li be the
number of different values (labels) that are possi-
ble for vi. The possible labels of each variable are
the partitions that the vertex can be assigned. A
vertex with index i can be in the first i partitions
(i.e. Li = i).

2.2 Training Process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997644333333334">
Each pair of mentions (mi, mj) in a training doc-
ument is evaluated by the set of feature functions
shown in Figure 1. The values returned by these
functions form a positive example when the pair
of mentions corefer, and a negative one otherwise.
Three specialized models are constructed depend-
ing on the type of anaphor mention (mj) of the
pair: pronoun, named entity or nominal.
A decision tree is generated for each specialized
model and a set of rules is extracted with C4.5
rule-learning algorithm (Quinlan, 1993). These
rules are our set of constraints. The C4.5rules al-
gorithm generates a set of rules for each path from
the learned tree. It then checks if the rules can be
generalized by dropping conditions.
Given the training corpus, the weight of a con-
straint Ck is related with the number of exam-
ples where the constraint applies ACk and how
many of them corefer CCk. We define λk as
the weight of constraint Ck calculated as follows:
λk = ACk − 0.5

2.3 Resolution Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999730625">
Relaxation labeling (Relax) is a generic name for
a family of iterative algorithms which perform
function optimization, based on local informa-
tion (Hummel and Zucker, 1987). The algorithm
solves our weighted constraint satisfaction prob-
lem dealing with the edge weights. In this manner,
each vertex is assigned to a partition satisfying as
many constraints as possible. To do that, the al-
gorithm assigns a probability for each possible la-
bel of each variable. Let H = (h1, h2, ... , hn) be
the weighted labeling to optimize, where each hi
is a vector containing the probability distribution
of vi, that is: hi = (hi1, hi2, ... , hiLi). Given that
the resolution process is iterative, the probability
for label l of variable vi at time step t is hil(t), or
simply hil when the time step is not relevant.

The support for a pair variable-label (Sil) ex-
presses how compatible is the assignment of la-
bel l to variable vi taking into account the labels
of adjacent variables and the edge weights. The
support is defined as the sum of the edge weights
that relate variable vi with each adjacent variable
vj multiplied by the weight for the same label l of
variable vj: Sil = Ej∈A(vi) wij x hjl where wij is
the edge weight obtained in Equation 1 and vertex
vi has |A(vi) |adjacent vertices. In our version of
the algorithm for coreference resolution A(vi) is
the list of adjacent vertices of vi but only consid-
ering the ones with an index k &lt; i.
The aim of the algorithm is to find a weighted
labeling such that global consistency is maxi-

able. The final partitioning is directly obtained
from the weighted labeling H assigning to each
variable the label with maximum probability.
The pseudo-code of the relaxation algorithm
can be found in Figure 2. The process updates
the weights of the labels in each step until con-
vergence, i.e. when no more significant changes
are done in an iteration. Finally, the assigned label
for a variable is the one with the highest weight.

3 Semeval task participation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997958">
RelaxCor have participated in the Semeval task for
English, Catalan and Spanish. The system does
not detect the mentions of the text by itself. Thus,
the participation has been restricted to the gold-
standard evaluation, which includes the manual
annotated information and also provides the men-
tion boundaries.
All the knowledge required by the feature func-
tions (Figure 1) is obtained from the annota-
tions of the corpora and no external resources
have been used, with the exception of WordNet
(Miller, 1995) for English. In this case, the sys-
tem has been run two times for English: English-
open, using WordNet, and English-closed, without
WordNet.

3.1 Language and format adaptation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995131578948">
The whole methodology of RelaxCor including
the resolution algorithm and the training process
is totally independent of the language of the docu-
ment. The only parts that need few adjustments are
the preprocess and the set of feature functions. In
most cases, the modifications in the feature func-
tions are just for the different format of the data
for different languages rather than for specific lan-
guage issues. Moreover, given that the task in-
cludes many information about the mentions of the
documents such as part of speech, syntactic depen-
dency, head and semantic role, no preprocess has
been needed.
One of the problems we have found adapting the
system to the task corpora was the large amount
of available data. As described in Section 2.2,
the training process generates a feature vector for
each pair of mentions into a document for all
the documents of the training data set. However,
the great number of training documents and their
length overwhelmed the software that learns the
constraints. In order to reduce the amount of pair
examples, we run a clustering process to reduce
the number of negative examples using the posi-
tive examples as the centroids. Note that negative
examples are near 94% of the training examples,
and many of them are repeated. For each positive
example (a corefering pair of mentions), only the
negative examples with distance less than a thresh-
old d are included in the final training data. The
distance is computed as the number of different
values inside the feature vector. After some exper-
iments over development data, the value of d was
assigned to 3. Thus, the negative examples were
discarded when they have more than three features
different than any positive example.
Our results for the development data set are
shown in Table 1.

3.2 Results analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984712">
Results of RelaxCor for the test data set are shown
in Table 2. One of the characteristics of the sys-
tem is that the resolution process always takes
into account the whole set of mentions and avoids
any possible pair-linkage contradiction as well as
forces transitivity. Therefore, the system favors
the precision, which results on high scores with
metrics CEAF and B3. However, the system is
penalized with the metrics based on pair-linkage,
specially with MUC. Although RelaxCor has the
highest precision scores even for MUC, the recall
is low enough to finally obtain low scores for F1.
Regarding the test scores of the task comparing
with the other participants (Recasens et al., 2010),
RelaxCor obtains the best performances for Cata-

B3; open: B3) and Spanish (B3). Moreover, Relax-
Cor is the most precise system for all the metrics
in all the languages except for CEAF in English-
open and Spanish. This confirms the robustness of
the results of RelaxCor but also remarks that more
knowledge or more information is needed to in-
crease the recall of the system without loosing this
precision
The incorporation of WordNet to the English
run is the only difference between English-open
and English-closed. The scores are slightly higher
when using WordNet but not significant. Analyz-
ing the MUC scores, note that the recall is im-
proved, while precision decreases a little which
corresponds with the information and the noise
that WordNet typically provides.
The results for the test and development are
very similar as expected, except the Spanish (es)
ones. The recall considerably falls from develop-
ment to test. It is clearly shown in the MUC recall
and also is indirectly affecting on the other scores.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964714285714">
The participation of RelaxCor to the Semeval
coreference resolution task has been useful to eval-
uate the system in multiple languages using data
never seen before. Many published systems typi-
cally use the same data sets (ACE and MUC) and
it is easy to unintentionally adapt the system to the
corpora and not just to the problem. This kind of
tasks favor comparisons between systems with the
same framework and initial conditions.
The results obtained confirm the robustness of
the RelaxCor, and the performance is considerably
good in the state of the art. The system avoids con-
tradictions in the results which causes a high pre-
cision. However, more knowledge is needed about
the mentions in order to increase the recall without
loosing that precision. A further error analysis is
needed, but one of the main problem is the lack of
semantic information and world knowledge spe-
cially for the nominal mentions – the mentions that
are NPs but not including named entities neither
pronouns–.
