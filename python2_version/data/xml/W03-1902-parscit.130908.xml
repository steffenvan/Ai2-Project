This work presents the data model we
adopted for annotating coreference. Our
data model includes different levels of an-
notation, such as part-of-speech, syntax
and discourse. We compare our encod-
ing schemes to the abstract XML encod-
ing being proposed as standard. We also
present our tool for coreference resolution
that handles our data model.

We have been dealing with corpus based studies
since 1997 (Renata Vieira and Simone Teufel, 1997;
Poesio et al., 1997). Our focus has been the study
of coreference. In the study of coreference we have
dealt with annotation experiments (manual and auto-
matic) and their respective annotation schemes. To
work on coreference we used information from syn-
tactic annotated corpus, the Penn Treebank. Our re-
sults (annotated corpus with coreference links and
classification of coreference status) were Prolog en-
coded. When we first adapted our tool for Por-
tuguese (Rossi et al., 2001) we dealt with other tools
and annotation formats. The resources built on these
previous works were difficult to share due to their
particular information encoding.
Our current work in the COMMOn-REFs project
(A computational model for processing referring ex-
pressions)&apos;, involves Portuguese and French. We

are using MMAX, a tool for multimodal annotation
in XML (Müller and Strube, 2001), for manual an-
notation of coreference, and we are developing a
tool for automatic coreference resolution. Our tool
deals with XML encoding provided by MMAX and
syntactic information for Portuguese and French en-
coded in XML. In order to be able to share the re-
sources being built, we are relating our model with
proposed standards.
In Section 2 we present previous annotation for-
mats that we dealt with. In Section 3 we give an
overview of the work in COMMOn-REFs. Section 4
relates our current model with the standards recently
proposed (Ide and Romary, 2002; Ide and Romary,
2003; Ide and Romary, 2001). Section 5 describes
our tool for coreference resolution. A discussion on
the problems we face with our annotation model is
presented in Section 6.

Our first annotation schemes were Prolog lists of
treebank sentences and their noun phrases (NPs), as
shown in Figure 1. The lists were extracted from
Lisp lists of the Penn Treebank. These lists were
manipulated in our experiments on coreference an-
notation and resolution.
The results of coreference annotation were lists of
Prolog facts dcc(Index1,Index2,Code) as shown
in Figure 2. Index1 refers to the sequen-
tial numbering of definite descriptions; Index2
refers to the sequential numbering of noun
phrases; and Code refers to their classification,
according to discourse status (Poesio and Vieira,
1998). For some of them there were also facts

notation to the data by running the Prolog code that
loaded the lists of NPs and sentences and generated
their indexes. Although we had carried out intensive
research with these resources and tools, the re-use of
our data in other environments was very difficult.
Despite the lack of fully annotated data for Por-
tuguese, we tried to check out whether the same
heuristics we used for English would be suitable for
this new language. To test our heuristics we used
the PALAVRAS parser2 (Bick, 2000) to parse Por-
tuguese corpus. From parsed texts we extracted Pro-
log lists of NPs as illustrated in Figure 3. Experi-
ments were carried out over these resources. Heuris-
tics for correference resolution were adapted to Por-
tuguese and the results obtained were comparable to
those previously obtained for English. However, the
genericity of the Portuguese resolver and annotated
data still raised the same re-usability problems as for
English, since the encoding format had not evolved.

and Portuguese). Therefore, we have to share cor-
pora and tools, initially available under different for-
mats.
We adopted MMAX3 as our manual annotation
tool. With MMAX we could annotate our corpus
according to our theoretical principles. The follow-
ing corpus studies were developed with the aid of
the tool: (Salmon-Alt and Vieira, 2002; Vieira et al.,
2002b; Vieira et al., 2002a). In these studies, our
annotation targets were manually marked and coref-
erence information was added to them according to
subjects’ analysis of the texts.
We are currently developing a coreference resolu-
tion tool on the basis of XML files and XSL scripts.
The tool manipulates several levels of linguistic in-
formation. Parsing information has been provided
by the PALAVRAS parser. The parser output is
transformed into two XML files: one with POS
and another with syntactic information (chunks).
Coreference information, manually annotated with
MMAX (markables), is used for evaluation. Our
tool, besides manipulating three different annotation
levels (POS, chunks, markables), creates two others:
anaphors and candidates, as detailed in Section 5.
As we are interested in having our resources made
available, we relate our annotation schemes to stan-
dard proposals presented in (Ide and Romary, 2002;
Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide and Romary, 2001).

Directions for standard corpus encoding in XML
have been proposed in (Ide and Romary, 2002; Ide
and Romary, 2003; Ide and Romary, 2001). Such
efforts consist on defining abstract formats for cor-
pus annotation that could be instantiated according
to specific project requirements. An abstract XML
file can be generated for each annotation level ac-
cording to a Virtual Annotation Markup Language
(VAML). The structure of this language is defined
by a skeleton that consists on &lt;struct&gt; (a node/level
in the annotation) and &lt;feat&gt; elements (feature at-
tached to the enclosing &lt;struct&gt; node).
Particular project specifications are defined
through data categories (component categories to be
annotated) and dialect (encoding style). On the basis
of these specifications, a mapping between VAML
and Concrete AML (CAML) can be made. CAML
is the language used for annotation encoding in par-
ticular projects.

<bodyText confidence="0.99997832">
Our first experiments with MMAX were on man-
ual coreference annotation. The tool required spe-
cific input and output formats. Our corpus, that is,
the primary data, were first converted from raw texts
to XML, encoded as &lt;word&gt; elements, like the ex-
ample in Figure 4 for the sentences O jogador pode
deixar o time. Ele recebeu uma proposta excelente.
(The player may leave the club. He received an ex-
cellent proposal.) Each corpus token (words and
punctuation) corresponds to a &lt;word&gt;.
The coreference was manually annotated and en-
coded as &lt;markable&gt; elements. Each anaphoric ex-
pression and antecedent were represented by mark-
ables. Anaphors’ markables had an extra attribute
“pointer”, that refers to its antecedent markable. An
example of a markable file is presented on Figure
5(a). Markables correspond to our final level of an-
notation. The “span” attribute refers to our primary
data, the words. The other attributes (coref, classific)
were specified according to our application. Fig-
ure 5(b) represents the abstract XML encoding for
our markables file, according to VAML4. Pointer,
coreference and classification compose our dialect
vocabulary for the following data categories: an-
tecedent and types of discourse status, as in (Poesio

1992). According to our dialect instantiation style,
the data categories are represented as attributes of
&lt;markable&gt; elements.
To develop a tool for automatic coreference reso-
lution, we needed to consider other intermediate lev-
els of annotation: source of linguistic information
used for solving anaphoras.
Our corpus was analysed by the Portuguese parser
PALAVRAS (Bick, 2000). The original format of
PALAVRAS output is not standard. As previously
presented in Figure 3, on each line of the figure:
the first symbol represents the syntactic func-
tion (‘SUBJ’= subject, ‘N’=noun modifier,
‘H’=head, etc.);
following ‘:’ , we have the syntactic form for
groups of words (’np’=noun phrase, etc.) and
POS-tags for single words (’n’=noun, ’v’=verb,
etc.);
in brackets are the word canonical form and
other inflectional tags;
after the brackets comes the word as it occurs
in the corpus.
The ‘=’ signs in the beginning of each line repre-
sent the level of the phrase in the parsing trees.

http://visl.hum.sdu.dk/visl/pt/info/symbolset-manual.html.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950333333333">
We defined the XML encoding for PALAVRAS
output. We split PALAVRAS output into two anno-
tation levels, one for POS and another for syntactic
data. Figure 6(a) shows our scheme for POS file.
The corresponding abstract XML file is presented on
Figure 6(b). Our data categories are word canonic
form (lemma), pos, gender, number, person, tense,
mode, and case. According to our dialect instanti-
ation style, each POS data category is represented
by a new XML element, the other inflexional tags
are encoded as attributes of this element. By han-
dling a parsed corpus we could treat compounds at
word level; the multi word expression “São Paulo”,
for example, is tokenised as one word and codified
as &lt;word id=&amp;quot;word_9&amp;quot;&gt;São_Paulo&lt;/word&gt;.
We encode syntactic data as chunks. Each syntac-
tic structure is represented by a &lt;chunk&gt; element.
Figure 7(a) shows our encoding. The mapping to
abstract XML is presented on Figure 7(b). In our di-
alect, each &lt;chunk&gt; in the concrete XML encoding
corresponds to a &lt;struct&gt; in the abstract one.

al., 1995), and all heuristics can access the input files
when necessary. Our tool strategy follows four main
steps: anaphor selection, candidates selection, reso-
lution, and output generation.
Two new intermediate annotation levels are
generated: the anaphor entities (represented by
&lt;anaphor&gt; elements) and antecedent candidates
(represented by &lt;candidate&gt; elements).
The &lt;candidate&gt; represents possible antecedents
in the corpus, and it also has a “span” attribute. (Fig-
ure 9(a)). Different candidate sets can be gener-
ated according to the heuristics used for its selec-
tion. demonstrates the corresponding VAML en-
coding. The &lt;anaphor&gt; depicts the anaphoric noun
phrases (pronouns, definite descriptions, demonstra-
tives) and it has the attribute“span” (Figure 9(b)).
Through “span” value we can get information from
the input files (words, POS, chunks), needed for the
resolution process.
Along the resolution process other attributes
are added to anaphor elements, such as “coref”,
“pointer” and “classif” attributes, as seen in Fig-
ure 10(a). Figure 10(b) represents the corresponding
VAML encoding for the &lt;anaphor&gt; elements.
The heuristics to be applied to resolve coreference

ferring expressions (Vieira and Poesio, 2000; Lap-
pin and Leass, 1994; Strube et al., 2002) and they
are not discussed here.
The output is the last step in the process and
it is also played by a stylesheet that translates the
&lt;anaphor&gt; nodes into &lt;markable&gt; ones, so the re-
sults can be visualized using the MMAX tool.

We have presented the evolution of our annotation
schemes over 7 years of corpus research. We be-
lieve that a standard orientation may shed some light
to those who are defining their projects. Concerning
annotation level relations our annotation is based on
object-based anchoring, especially because our pri-
mary data is represented by XML elements (words
in our dialect, basic struct elements with id attributes
in VAML).
Considering relations like parallelism, alterna-
tives and aggregation (Ide and Romary, 2002) we
see that our model includes aggregation at the chunk
level. When studying annotation agreement we need
to represent alternative data according to the judg-
ment of each annotator (although we have adopted
duplicated annotated files previously in our project).
Previous work on encoding standards has men-
tioned mainly POS and syntactic annotation. In this
paper we extended its use for coreference annota-
tion. Our data model could be adequately mapped
to the standards.
An issue raised by coreference annotation is the
need of two references for primary data in the same
&lt;struct&gt;, one for anaphor (target) and another for its
antecedent. In our examples, we encoded the ref-
erence to primary data indicating the antecedent by
&lt;feat&gt; elements with attribute type=“pointer”.
An advantage we could expect to take from work
related to standards is knowledge about the impact
on performance in data handling according to en-
coding decisions.
Our project deals with different input and output
formats. We intend to share our results and compare
our techniques to different ones for anaphora reso-

We could only link the annotation to the data by running the Prolog code that loaded the lists of NPs and sentences and generated their indexes. Although we had carried out intensive research with these resources and tools, the re-use of our data in other environments was very difficult. Despite the lack of fully annotated data for Portuguese, we tried to check out whether the same heuristics we used for English would be suitable for this new language. To test our heuristics we used the PALAVRAS parser2 (Bick, 2000) to parse Portuguese corpus. From parsed texts we extracted Prolog lists of NPs as illustrated in Figure 3. Experiments were carried out over these resources. Heuristics for correference resolution were adapted to Portuguese and the results obtained were comparable to those previously obtained for English. However, the genericity of the Portuguese resolver and annotated data still raised the same re-usability problems as for English, since the encoding format had not evolved. 3 COMMOn-REFs In the COMMOn-REFs project we face the challenge of dealing with different languages (French 2http://visl</context>

According to our dialect instantiation style, the data categories are represented as attributes of &lt;markable&gt; elements. To develop a tool for automatic coreference resolution, we needed to consider other intermediate levels of annotation: source of linguistic information used for solving anaphoras. Our corpus was analysed by the Portuguese parser PALAVRAS (Bick, 2000). The original format of PALAVRAS output is not standard. As previously presented in Figure 3, on each line of the figure: the first symbol represents the syntactic function (‘SUBJ’= subject, ‘N’=noun modifier, ‘H’=head, etc.); following ‘:’ , we have the syntactic form for groups of words (’np’=noun phrase, etc.) and POS-tags for single words (’n’=noun, ’v’=verb, etc.); in brackets are the word canonical form and other inflectional tags; after the brackets comes the word as it occurs in the corpus.

Our tool deals with XML encoding provided by MMAX and syntactic information for Portuguese and French encoded in XML. In order to be able to share the resources being built, we are relating our model with proposed standards. In Section 2 we present previous annotation formats that we dealt with. In Section 3 we give an overview of the work in COMMOn-REFs. Section 4 relates our current model with the standards recently proposed (Ide and Romary, 2002; Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide and Romary, 2001). Section 5 describes our tool for coreference resolution. A discussion on the problems we face with our annotation model is presented in Section 6. 2 Previous work Our first annotation schemes were Prolog lists of treebank sentences and their noun phrases (NPs), as shown in Figure 1. The lists were extracted from Lisp lists of the Penn Treebank. These lists were manipulated in our experiments on coreference annotation and resolution. The results of coreference annotation were lists of Prolog facts dcc(Index1,Index2,Code) as shown in Figure 2. Index1 refers to the sequen</context>

The parser output is transformed into two XML files: one with POS and another with syntactic information (chunks). Coreference information, manually annotated with MMAX (markables), is used for evaluation. Our tool, besides manipulating three different annotation levels (POS, chunks, markables), creates two others: anaphors and candidates, as detailed in Section 5. As we are interested in having our resources made available, we relate our annotation schemes to standard proposals presented in (Ide and Romary, 2002; Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide and Romary, 2001). 3The MMAX tool is available for download in http://www.eml.org/english/Research/NLP/Downloads. &lt;struct type=&amp;quot;CRAnnot&amp;quot;&gt; ... &lt;struct id=&amp;quot;m1&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;C-level&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;feat type=&amp;quot;coref&amp;quot;&gt;no&lt;/feat&gt; &lt;feat type=&amp;quot;classif&amp;quot;&gt;disc stat _1&lt;/feat&gt; &lt;feat type=&amp;quot;target&amp;quot;&gt;#w1 #w_3&lt;/feat&gt; &lt;/struct&gt; &lt;struct id=&amp;quot;m3&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;C-level&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;feat type=&amp;quot;coref&amp;quot;&gt;yes&lt;/feat&gt; &lt;feat type=&amp;quot;pointer&amp;quot;&gt;#m1&lt;/feat&gt; &lt;feat type=&amp;quot;classif&amp;quot;&gt;disc_stat_2&lt;/feat&gt; &lt;feat type=&amp;quot;target&amp;quot;&gt;#w8&lt;/feat&gt; &lt;/struct&gt; ... &lt;/struct&gt; &lt;markables&gt; ... &lt;markable id=&amp;quot;markable_1&amp;quot; coref=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; classif=&amp;quot;disc_stat_1&amp;quot; span=&amp;quot;word_1..word_2&amp;quot; /&gt; ... &lt;markable i</context>

Such efforts consist on defining abstract formats for corpus annotation that could be instantiated according to specific project requirements. An abstract XML file can be generated for each annotation level according to a Virtual Annotation Markup Language (VAML). The structure of this language is defined by a skeleton that consists on &lt;struct&gt; (a node/level in the annotation) and &lt;feat&gt; elements (feature attached to the enclosing &lt;struct&gt; node). Particular project specifications are defined through data categories (component categories to be annotated) and dialect (en</context>

Therefore, we have to share corpora and tools, initially available under different formats. We adopted MMAX3 as our manual annotation tool. With MMAX we could annotate our corpus according to our theoretical principles. The following corpus studies were developed with the aid of the tool: (Salmon-Alt and Vieira, 2002; Vieira et al., 2002b; Vieira et al., 2002a). In these studies, our annotation targets were manually marked and coreference information was added to them according to subjects’ analysis of the texts. We are currently developing a coreference resolution tool on the basis of XML files and XSL scripts. The tool manipulates several levels of linguistic information. Parsing information has been provided by the PALAVRAS parser. The parser output is transformed into two XML files: one with POS and another with syntactic information (chunks).

Therefore, we have to share corpora and tools, initially available under different formats. We adopted MMAX3 as our manual annotation tool. With MMAX we could annotate our corpus according to our theoretical principles. The following corpus studies were developed with the aid of the tool: (Salmon-Alt and Vieira, 2002; Vieira et al., 2002b; Vieira et al., 2002a). In these studies, our annotation targets were manually marked and coreference information was added to them according to subjects’ analysis of the texts. We are currently developing a coreference resolution tool on the basis of XML files and XSL scripts. The tool manipulates several levels of linguistic information. Parsing information has been provided by the PALAVRAS parser. The parser output is transformed into two XML files: one with POS and another with syntactic information (chunks). Coreference information, manually annotated with MMAX (markables), is used for </context>
