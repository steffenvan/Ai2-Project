In this talk, we will,show how techniques for plan-
ning text and discourse can be generalized to plan
the structure and content of multimodal communi-
cations, that integrate natural language, pointing,
graphics, and animations. The central claim of
this talk is that the generation of multimodal dis-
course can be considered as an incremental plan-
ning process that aims to achieve a given commu-
nicative goal.
One of the surprises from our research is that
it is actually possible to extend and adapt many
of the fundamental concepts developed to date
in computatational linguistics in such a way that
they become useful for multimodal discourse as
well. This means that an interesting methodologi-
cal transfer from the area of natural language pro-
cessing to a much broader computational model of
multimodal communication is possible. In partic-
ular, semantic and pragmatic concepts like speech
acts, coherence, focus, communicative act, dis-
course model, reference, implicature, anaphora,
rhetorical relations and scope ambiguity take an
extended meaning in the context of multimodal
discourse.
It is an important goal of this research not
simply to merge the verbalization and visualiza-
tion results of mode-specific generators, but to
carefully coordinate them in such a way that they
generate a multiplicative improvement in commu-
nication capabilities. Allowing all of the modali-
ties to refer to and depend upon each other is a
key to the richness of multimodal communication.
A basic principle underlying our model is that
the various constituents of a multimodal commu-
nication should be generated from a common rep-
resentation of what is to be conveyed. This raises
the question of how to decompose a given com-
municative goal into subgoals to be realized by
the mode-specific generators, so that they com-
plement each other. To address this problem, we
explore computational models of the cognitive de-
cision process, coping with questions such as what
should go into text, what should go into graphics,
and which kinds of links between the verbal and
non-verbal fragments are necessary. In addition,
we deal with layout as a rhetorical force, influ-
encing the intentional and attentional state of the
discourse participants.
We have been engaged in work in the area of
multimodal communication for several years now,
starting with the HAM-ANS (Wahlster et al. 1983)
and VITRA systems (Wahlster 1989), which auto-
matically create natural language descriptions of
pictures and image sequences shown on the screen.
These projects resulted in a better understanding
of how perception interacts with language produc-
tion. Since then, we have been investigating ways
of integrating tactile pointing and graphics with
natural language understanding and generation
in the XTRA (Wahlster 1991) and WIP projects
(Wahlster et al. 1991).
The task of the knowledge-based presentation
system WIP is the context-sensitive generation of
a variety of multimodal communications from an
input including a presentation goal (Wahlster et
al. 1993a). The presentation goal is a formal repre-
sentation of the communicative intent specified by
a back-end application system. WIP is currently
able to generate simple multimodal explanations
in German and English on using an espresso ma-
chine, assembling a lawn-mower, or installing a
modem, demonstrating our claim of language and
application independence. WIP is a highly adap-
tive multimodal presentation system, since all of
its output is generated on the fly and customized
for the intended discourse situation. The quest for
adaptation is based on the fact that it is impos-
sible to anticipate the needs and requirements of
each potential dialog partner in an infinite number
of discourse situations. Thus all presentation deci-
sions are postponed until runtime. In contrast to
hypermedia-based approaches, WIP does not use
any preplanned texts or graphics. That is, each
presentation is designed from scratch by reasoning

from first principles using commonsense presenta-
tion knowledge.
We approximate the fact that multimodal
communication is always situated by introducing
seven discourse parameters in our model. The cur-
rent system includes a choice between user stereo-
types (e.g. novice, expert), target languages (Ger-
man vs. English), layout formats (e.g. paper hard-
copy, slide, screen display), output modes (incre-
mental output vs. complete output only), pre-
ferred mode (e.g. text, graphics, or no prefer-
ence), and binary switches for space restrictions
and speech output. This set of parameters is used
to specify design constraints that must be satisfied
by the final presentation. The combinatorics of
WIP&apos;s contextual parameters can generate 576 al-
ternate multimodal presentations of the same con-
tent.
At the heart of the multimodal presentation
system WIP is a parallel top-down planner (Andre
and Rist 1993) and a constraint-based layout man-
ager. While the root of the hierarchical plan struc-
ture for a particular multimodal communication
corresponds to a complex communicative act such
as describing a process, the leaves are elementary
acts that verbalize and visualize information spec-
ified in the input from the back-end application
system.
In multimodal generation systems, three dif-
ferent processes are distinguished: a content plan-
ning process, a mode selection process and a con-
tent realization process. A sequential architec-
ture in which data only flow from the &amp;quot;what to
present&amp;quot; to the &amp;quot;how to present&amp;quot; part has proven
inappropriate because the components responsible
for selecting the contents would have to anticipate
all decisions of the realization components. This
problem is compounded if content realization is
done by separate components (e.g. for language,
pointing, graphics and animations) of which the
content planner has only limited knowledge.
It seems even inappropriate to sequentialize
content planning and mode selection. Selecting a
mode of presentation depends to a large extent on
the nature of the information to be conveyed.
On the other hand, content planning is
strongly influenced by previously selected mode
combinations. E.g., to graphically refer to a phys-
ical object (Rist and Andre 1992), we need visual
information that may be irrelevant to textual ref-
erences. In the WIP system, we interleave content
and mode selection. In contrast to this, presen-
tation planning and content realization are per-
formed by separate components to enable parallel
processing (Wahlster et al. 1993b).
In a follow-up project to WIP called PPP
(Personalized Plan-Based Presenter), we are cur-
rently addressing the additional problem of plan-
ning presentation acts such as pointing and coor-
dinated speech output during the display of the
multimodal material synthesized by WIP.
The insights and experience we gained from
the design and implementation of the multimodal
systems HAM-ANS, VITRA, XTRA and WIP
provide a good starting point for a deeper un-
derstanding of the interdependencies of language,
graphics, pointing, and animations in coordinated
multimodal discourse.

These projects resulted in a better understanding of how perception interacts with language production. Since then, we have been investigating ways of integrating tactile pointing and graphics with natural language understanding and generation in the XTRA (Wahlster 1991) and WIP projects (Wahlster et al. 1991). The task of the knowledge-based presentation system WIP is the context-sensitive generation of a variety of multimodal communications from an input including a presentation goal (Wahlster et al. 1993a). The presentation goal is a formal representation of the communicative intent specified by a back-end application system. WIP is currently able to generate simple multimodal explanations in German and English on using an espresso machine, assembling a lawn-mower, or installing a modem, demonstrating our claim of language and application independence. WIP is a highly adaptive multimodal presentation system, since all of its output is generated on the fly and customized for the intended discourse situation. The quest for adaptation is based on the fact that it is impossible to anticipate the </context>
