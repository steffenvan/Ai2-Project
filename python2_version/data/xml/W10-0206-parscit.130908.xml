Emotion cause detection is a new research area
in emotion processing even though most theo-
ries of emotion treat recognition of a triggering
cause event as an integral part of emotion. As a
first step towards fully automatic inference of
cause-emotion correlation, we propose a text-
driven, rule-based approach to emotion cause
detection in this paper. First of all, a Chinese
emotion cause annotated corpus is constructed
based on our proposed annotation scheme. By
analyzing the corpus data, we identify seven
groups of linguistic cues and generalize two
sets of linguistic rules for detection of emotion
causes. With the linguistic rules, we then de-
velop a rule-based system for emotion cause
detection. In addition, we propose an evaluation
scheme with two phases for performance as-
sessment. Experiments show that our system
achieves a promising performance for cause oc-
currence detection as well as cause event detec-
tion. The current study should lay the ground
for future research on the inferences of implicit
information and the discovery of new informa-
tion based on cause-event relation.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999795727272727">
Text-based emotion processing has attracted plenty
of attention in NLP. Most research has focused on
the emotion detection and classification by
identifying the emotion types, for instances
happiness and sadness, for a given sentence or
document (Alm 2005, Mihalcea and Liu 2006,
Tokuhisa et al. 2008). However, on top of this
surface level information, deeper level information
regarding emotions, such as the experiencer, cause,
and result of an emotion, needs to be extracted and
analyzed for real world applications (Alm 2009).

In this paper, we aim at mining one of the crucial
deep level types of information, i.e. emotion cause,
which provides useful information for applications
ranging from economic forecasting, public opinion
mining, to product design. Emotion cause detection
is a new research area in emotion processing. In
emotion processing, the cause event and emotion
correlation is a fertile ground for extraction and
entailment of new information. As a first step
towards fully automatic inference of cause-
emotion correlation, we propose a text-driven,
rule-based approach to emotion cause detection in
this paper.
Most theories of emotion treat recognition of
a triggering cause event as an integral part of
emotional experience (Descartes 1649, James 1884,
Plutchik 1962, Wierzbicka 1999). In this study,
cause events refer to the explicitly expressed
arguments or events that evoke the presence of the
corresponding emotions. They are usually
expressed by means of propositions,
nominalizations, and nominals. For example, “they
like it” is the cause event of the emotion happiness
in the sentence “I was very happy that they like it”.
Note that we only take into account emotions that
are explicitly expressed, which are usually
presented by emotion keywords, e.g. “This
surprises me”. Implicit emotions that require
inference or connotation are not processed in this
first study. In this study, we first build a Chinese
emotion cause annotated corpus with five primary
emotions, i.e. happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and
surprise. We then examine various linguistic cues
which help detect emotion cause events: the
position of cause event and experiencer relative to
the emotion keyword, causative verbs (e.g. rang4
“to cause”), action verbs (e.g. xiang3dao4 “to think
about”), epistemic markers (e.g. kan4jian4 “to
see”), conjunctions (e.g. yin1wei4 “because”), and
prepositions (e.g. dui4yu2 “for”). With the help of

these cues, a list of linguistic rules is generalized.
Based on the linguistic rules, we develop a rule-
based system for emotion cause detection.
Experiments show that such a rule-based system
performs promisingly well. We believe that the
current study should lay the ground for future
research on inferences and discovery of new
information based on cause-event relation, such as
detection of implicit emotion or cause, as well as
prediction of public opinion based on cause events,
etc.

discusses the related work on various aspects of
emotion analysis. Section 3 describes the construc-
tion of the emotion cause corpus. Section 4
presents our rule-based system for emotion cause
detection. Section 5 describes its evaluation and
performance. Section 6 highlights our main contri-

2.1 Emotion Classes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943111111111">
Various approaches to emotion classification were
proposed in different fields, such as philosophy
(Spinoza 1675, James 1884), biology (Darwin
1859, linguistics (Wierzbicka 1999, Kövecses
2000), neuropsychology (Plutchik 1962, Turner
1996), and computer science (Ortony et al. 1988,
Picard 1995), as well as varying from language to
language. Although there is lack of agreement
among different theories on emotion classification,
a small number of primary emotions are commonly
assumed. Other emotions are secondary emotions
which are the mixtures of the primary emotions.
Researchers have attempted to propose the list
of primary emotions, varying from two to ten basic
emotions (Ekman 1984, Plutchik 1980, Turner
2000). Fear and anger appear on every list, whe-
reas happiness and sadness appear on most of the
lists. These four emotions, i.e. fear, anger, happi-
ness, and sadness, are the most common primary
emotions. Other less common primary emotions
are surprise, disgust, shame, distress, guilt, interest,
pain, and acceptance.
In this study, we adopt Turner’s emotion clas-
sification (2000), which identifies five primary
emotions, namely happiness, sadness, fear, anger,
and surprise. Turner’s list consists of primary emo-
tions agreed upon by most previous work.

2.2 Emotion Processing in Text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962432432432">
Textual emotion processing is still in its early stag-
es in NLP. Most of the previous works focus on
emotion classification given a known emotion con-
text such as a sentence or a document using either
rule-based (Masum et al. 2007, Chaumartin 2007)
or statistical approaches (Mihalcea and Liu 2005,
Kozareva et al. 2007). However, the performance
is far from satisfactory. What is more, many basic
issues remain unresolved, for instances, the rela-
tionships among emotions, emotion type selection,
etc. Tokuhisa et al. (2008) was the first to explore
both the issues of emotion detection and classifica-
tion. It created a Japanese emotion-provoking
event corpus for an emotion classification task us-
ing an unsupervised approach. However, only
49.4% of cases were correctly labeled. Chen et al.
(2009) developed two cognitive-based Chinese
emotion corpora using a semi-unsupervised ap-
proach, i.e. an emotion-sentence (sentences con-
taining emotions) corpus and a neutral-sentence
(sentences containing no emotion) corpus. They
showed that studies based on the emotion-sentence
corpus (~70%) outperform previous corpora.
Little research, if not none, has been done to
examine the interactions between emotions and the
corresponding cause events, which may make a
great step towards an effective emotion classifica-
tion model. The lack of research on cause events
restricted current emotion analysis to simple classi-
ficatory work without exploring the potentials of
the rich applications of putting emotion ‘in con-
text’. In fact, emotions can be invoked by percep-
tions of external events and in turn trigger
reactions. The ability to detect implicit invoking
causes as well as predict actual reactions will add
rich dimensions to emotion analysis and lead to
further research on event computing.

an emotion cause is and discuss how emotion
cause is linguistically expressed in Chinese. We

3.1 Cause Events
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.952096211538462">
Following Talmy (2000), the cause of an emotion
should be an event itself. In this work, it is called a
cause event. By cause event, we do not necessarily
mean the actual trigger of the emotion or what
leads to the emotion. Rather, it refers to the imme-
diate cause of the emotion, which can be the actual
trigger event or the perception of the trigger event.
Adapting TimeML annotation scheme (Saurí et al.
2004), events refer to situations that happen or oc-
cur. In this study, cause events specifically refer to
the explicitly expressed arguments or events that
are highly linked with the presence of the corres-
ponding emotions. In Lee et al.’s (2010) corpus,
cause events are categorized into two types: verbal
events and nominal events. Verbal events refer to
events that involve verbs (i.e. propositions and
nominalizations), whereas nominal events are
simply nouns (i.e. nominals). Some examples of
cause event types are given in bold face in (1)-(6).

3.2 Corpus Data and Annotation Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984470588235">
Based on the list of 91 Chinese primary emotion
keywords identified in Chen et al. (2009), we ex-
tract 6,058 instances of sentences by keyword
matching from the Sinica Corpus1, which is a
tagged balanced corpus of Mandarin Chinese con-
taining a total of ten million words. Each instance
contains the focus sentence with the emotion key-
word “&lt;FocusSentence&gt;” plus the sentence before
“&lt;PrefixSentence&gt;” and after “&lt;SuffixSentence&gt;”
it. The extracted instances include all primary emo-
tion keywords occurring in the Sinica Corpus ex-
cept for the emotion class happiness, as the
keywords of happiness exceptionally outnumber
other emotion classes. In order to balance the
number of each emotion class, we set the upper
limit at about 1,600 instances for each primary
emotion.
Note that the presence of emotion keywords
does not necessarily convey emotional information
due to different possible reasons such as negative
polarity and sense ambiguity. Hence, by manual
inspection, we remove instances that 1) are non-
emotional; 2) contain highly ambiguous emotion
keywords, such as ru2yi4 “wish-fulfilled”, hai4xiu1
“to be shy”, wei2nan2 “to feel awkward”, from the
corpus. After the removal, the remaining instances
in the emotion cause corpus is 5,629. Among the
remaining instances, we also remove the emotion
keywords in which the instances do not express
that particular emotion and yet are emotional. The
total emotion keywords in the corpus is 5,958.
For each emotional instance, two annotators
manually annotate cause events of each keyword.

<bodyText confidence="0.997707523809524">
Figure 1 shows an example of annotated emotional
sentences in corpus, presented as pinyin with tones,
followed by an English translation. For an emotion
keyword tagged as &lt;id=0&gt;, [*01n] marks the be-
ginning of its cause event while [*02n] marks the
end. The “0” shows which index of emotion key-
word it refers to, “1” marks the beginning of the
cause event, “2” marks the end, and “n” indicates
that the cause is a nominal event. For an emotion
keyword tagged as &lt;id=1&gt;, [*11e] marks the be-
ginning of the cause event while [*12e] marks the
end, in which “e” refers to a verbal event, i.e. ei-
ther a proposition or a nominalization. An emotion
keyword can sometimes be associated with more
than one cause, in which case both causes are
marked. The emotional sentences containing no
explicitly expressed cause event remain as they are.
The actual number of extracted instances of
each emotion class to be analyzed, the positive
emotional instances, and the instances with cause

By analyzing the corpus data, we examine the
correlations between emotions and cause events in
terms of various linguistic cues: the position of
cause event, verbs, epistemic markers,
conjunctions, and prepositions. We hypothesize
that these cues will facilitate the detection of
emotion cause events.
First, we calculate the distribution of cause
event types of each emotion as well as the position
of cause events relative to emotion keywords and
experiencers. The total number of emotional
instances regarding each emotion is given in Table

and that cause events tend to occur at the position
to the left of the emotion keyword, with fear (52%)
being no preference. This may be attributed to the
fact that fear can be triggered by either factive or
potential causes, which is rare for other primary
emotions. For fear, factive causes tend to take the
left position whereas potential causes tend to take
the right position.

Group I includes three common causative verbs,
and Group II a list of verbs of thinking and talking.
Group III is a list of say verbs. Group IV includes
four types of epistemic markers which are usually
verbs marking the cognitive awareness of emotion
in the complement position (Lee and Huang 2009).
The epistemic markers include verbs of seeing,
hearing, knowing, and existing. Group V covers
some prepositions which all roughly mean ‘for’.
Group VI contains the conjunctions that explicitly
mark the emotion cause. Group VII includes other
linguistic cues that do not fall into any of the six
groups. Each group of linguistic cues serves as an
indicator marking the cause events in different
structures of emotional constructions, in which
Group I specifically marks the end of the cause
events while the other six groups marks the
beginning of the cause events.

4.2 Linguistic Rules for Cause Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999787473684211">
We examine 100 emotional sentences of each emo-
tion keyword randomly extracted from the devel-
opment data, and generalize some rules for
identifying the cause of the corresponding emotion
verb (Lee 2010). The cause is considered as a
proposition. It is generally assumed that a proposi-
tion has a verb which optionally takes a noun oc-
curring before it as the subject and a noun after it
as the object. However, a cause can also be ex-
pressed as a nominal. In other words, both the pre-
dicate and the two arguments are optional provided
that at least one of them is present.
We also manually identify the position of the
experiencer as well as the linguistic cues discussed
in Section 4.1. All these components may occur in
the clause containing the emotion verb (focus
clause), the clause before the focus clause, or the
clause after the focus clause. The abbreviations
used in the rules are given as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.8131025">
C = Cause event
E = Experiencer
K = Keyword/emotion verb
B = Clause before the focus clause
F = Focus clause/the clause containing the emotion verb
A = Clause after the focus clause
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.502849">
For illustration, an example of the rule description
is given in Rule 1.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9324085">
Rule 1:
i) C(B/F) + I(F) + E(F) + K(F)
ii) E = the nearest Na/Nb/Nc/Nh after I in F
iii) C = the nearest (N)+(V)+(N) before I in F/B
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999666074074074">
Rule 1 indicates that the experiencer (E) appears to
be the nearest Na (common noun)/ Nb (proper
noun)/ Nc (place noun)/ Nh (pronoun) after Group
I cue words in the focus clause (F), while, at the
same time, it comes before the keyword (K). Be-
sides, the cause (C) comes before Group I cue
words. We simplify the proposition as a structure
of (N)+(V)+(N), which is very likely to contain the
cause event. Theoretically, in identifying C, we
should first look for the nearest verb occurring be-
fore Group I cue words in the focus sentence (F) or
the clause before the focus clause (B), and consider
this verb as an anchor. From this verb, we search to
the left for the nearest noun, and consider it as the
subject; we then search to the right for the nearest
noun until the presence of the cue words, and con-
sider it as the object. The detected subject, verb,
and object form the cause event. In most cases, the
experiencer is covertly expressed. It is, however,
difficult to detect such causes in practice as causes
may contain no verbs, and the two arguments are
optional. Therefore, we take the clause instead of
the structure of (N)+(V)+(N) as the actual cause.
Examples are given in (7) and (8). For both sen-
tences, the clause that comes before the cue word
is taken as the cause event of the emotion in ques-
tion.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981571428571">
An evaluation scheme is designed to assess the
ability to extract the cause of an emotion in context.
We specifically look into two phases of the per-
formance of such a cause recognition system.
Phase 1 assesses the detection of an emotion co-
occurrence with a cause; Phrase 2 evaluates the
recognition of the cause texts for an emotion.

The definitions of related metrics are presented in
Figure 2. For each emotion in a sentence, if neither
the gold-standard file nor the system file has a
cause, both precision and recall score 1; otherwise,
precision and recall are calculated by the scoring
method ScoreForTwoListOfCauses. As an emotion
may have more than one cause, ScoreForTwoLis-
tOfCauses calculates the overlap scores between
two lists of cause texts. Since emotion cause rec-
ognition is rather complicated, two relaxed string
match scoring methods are selected to compare
two cause texts, ScoreForTwoStrings: Relaxed
Match 1 uses the minimal overlap between the
gold-standard cause and the system cause. The sys-
tem cause is considered as correct provided that
there is at least one overlapping Chinese character;
Relaxed Match 2 is more rigid which takes into
account the overlap text length during scoring.

The detection of cause occurrence is considered a
preliminary task for emotion cause recognition and
is compounded by the fact that neutral sentences
are difficult to detect, as observed in Tokuhisa et al.
(2008). For Phase 1, each emotion keyword in a
sentence has a binary tag: Y (i.e. with a cause) or
N (without a cause). Similar to other NLP tasks,
we adopt the common evaluation metrics, i.e. accu-
racy, precision, recall, and F score.

cause detection and extraction.
Table 6 and 7 show the performances of the
baseline and our rule-based system in Phase 1. Ta-
ble 6 shows the overall accuracy, and Table 7
shows the detailed performances. In Table 6, we
find that our system and the baseline have similar
high accuracy scores. Yet Table 7 shows that both
systems achieve a high performance for emotions
with a cause, but much worse for emotions without
a cause. It is important to note that even though the
naive baseline system has comparably high per-
formance with our rule-based system in judging
whether there is a cause in context, this result is
biased by two facts. First, as the corpus contains
more than 80% of sentences with emotion, a sys-
tem which is biased toward detecting a cause, such
as the baseline system, naturally performs well. In
addition, once the actual cause is examined, we can
see that the baseline actually detects a lot of false
positives in the sense that the cause it identifies is
only correct in 4.39%. Our rule-based system
shows great promise in being able to deal with
neutral sentences effectively and being able to
detect the correct cause at least three times more
often than the baseline.
Table 8 shows the performances in Phase 2.
Comparing to the baseline, we find that our rules
improve the performance of cause recognition us-
ing Relaxed Match 1 and 2 scoring by 21% and
21% respectively. On the one hand, the 7% gap in
F-score between Relaxed Match 1 and 2 also indi-
cates that our rules can effectively locate the clause
of a cause. On the other hand, the rather low per-
formances of the baseline show that most causes
recognized by the baseline are wrong although the
baseline effectively detects the cause occurrence,
as indicated in Table 7. In addition, we check the
accuracy (precision) and contribution (recall) of
each rule. In descending order, the top four accu-
rate rules are: Rules 7, 10, 11, and 1; and the top
four contributive rules are: Rules 2, 15, 14, and 3.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992545">
Emotion processing has been a great challenge in
NLP. Given the fact that an emotion is often trig-
gered by cause events and that cause events are
integral parts of emotion, we propose a linguistic-
driven rule-based system for emotion cause detec-
tion, which is proven to be effective. In particular,
we construct a Chinese emotion cause corpus an-
notated with emotions and the corresponding cause
events. Since manual detection of cause events is
labor-intensive and time-consuming, we intend to
use the emotion cause corpus to produce automatic
extraction system for emotion cause events with
machine learning methods. We believe that our
rule-based system is useful for many real world
applications. For instance, the information regard-
ing causal relations of emotions is important for
product design, political evaluation, etc. Such a
system also shed light on emotion processing as
the detected emotion cause events can serve as
clues for the identification of implicit emotions.

Most research has focused on the emotion detection and classification by identifying the emotion types, for instances happiness and sadness, for a given sentence or document (Alm 2005, Mihalcea and Liu 2006, Tokuhisa et al. 2008). However, on top of this surface level information, deeper level information regarding emotions, such as the experiencer, cause, and result of an emotion, needs to be extracted and analyzed for real world applications (Alm 2009). 45 In this paper, we aim at mining one of the crucial deep level types of information, i.e. emotion cause, which provides useful information for applications ranging from economic forecasting, public opinion mining, to product design. Emotion cause detection is a new research area in emotion processing. In emotion processing, the cause event and emotion correlation is a fertile ground for extraction and entailment of new information. As a first step towards fully automatic inference of causeemotion correlation, we propose a text-driven, rule-based approach to emotion cause detection in this </context>

Little research, if not none, has been done to examine the interactions between emotions and the corresponding cause events, which may make a great step towards an effective emotion classification model.

Each group of linguistic cues serves as an indicator marking the cause events in different structures of emotional constructions, in which Group I specifically marks the end of the cause events while the other six groups marks the beginning of the cause events. 4.2 Linguistic Rules for Cause Detection We examine 100 emotional sentences of each emotion keyword randomly extracted from the development data, and generalize some rules for identifying the cause of the corresponding emotion verb (Lee 2010). The cause is considered as a proposition. It is generally assumed that a proposition has a verb which optionally takes a noun occurring before it as the subject and a noun after it as the object. However, a cause can also be expressed as a nominal. In other words, both the predicate and the two arguments are optional provided that at least one of them is present. We also manually identify the position of the experiencer as well as the linguistic cues discussed in Section 4.1. All these components may occur in the clause containing the emotion verb (focus clause), the clause before the focus </context>

The ability to detect implicit invoking causes as well as predict actual reactions will add rich dimensions to emotion analysis and lead to further research on event computing. 3 Emotion Cause Corpus This section briefly describes how the emotion cause corpus is constructed. We first explain what 46 an emotion cause is and discuss how emotion cause is linguistically expressed in Chinese. We then describe the corpus data and the annotation scheme. For more detailed discussion on the construction of the emotion cause corpus, please refer to Lee et al. (2010). 3.1 Cause Events Following Talmy (2000), the cause of an emotion should be an event itself. In this work, it is called a cause event. By cause event, we do not necessarily mean the actual trigger of the emotion or what leads to the emotion. Rather, it refers to the immediate cause of the emotion, which can be the actual trigger event or the perception of the trigger event. Adapting TimeML annotation scheme (Saurí et al. 2004), events refer to situations that happen or occur. In this study, cause events specifically refer to the explicitly expressed arguments or events that are highly linked </context>

This may be attributed to the fact that fear can be triggered by either factive or potential causes, which is rare for other primary emotions. For fear, factive causes tend to take the left position whereas potential causes tend to take the right position. 48 Second, we identify seven groups of linguistic cues that are highly collocated with cause events (Lee et al. 2010), as shown in Table 3. Table 3: Seven Groups of Linguistic Cues Group Cue Words I ‘to cause’: rang4, ling4, shi3 II ‘to think about’: e.g. xiang3 dao4, xiang3 qi3, yi1 xiang3 ‘to talk about’: e.g. shuo1dao4, jiang3dao4, tan2dao4 III ‘to say’: e.g. shuo1, dao4 IV ‘to see’: e.g. kan4dao4, kan4jian4, jian4dao4 ‘to hear’: e.g. ting1dao4, ting1 shuo1 ‘to know’: e.g. zhi1dao4, de2zhi1, fa1xian4 ‘to exist’: you3 V ‘for’ as in ‘I will do this for you’: wei4, wei4le ‘for’ as in ‘He is too old for the job’: dui4, dui4yu2 VI ‘because’: yin1, yin1wei4, you2yu2 VII ‘is’: deshi4 ‘at’: yu2 ‘can’: neng2 Group</context>

However, the performance is far from satisfactory. What is more, many basic issues remain unresolved, for instances, the relationships among emotions, emotion type selection, etc. Tokuhisa et al. (2008) was the first to explore both the issues of emotion detection and classification. It created a Japanese emotion-provoking event corpus for an emotion classification task using an unsupervised approach. However, only 49.4% of cases were correctly labeled. Chen et al. (2009) developed two cognitive-based Chinese emotion corpora using a semi-unsupervised approach, i.e. an emotion-sentence (sentences containing emotions) corpus and a neutral-sentence (sentences containing no emotion) corpus. They showed that studies based on the emotion-sentence corpus (~70%) outperform previous corpora. Little r</context>

The system cause is considered as correct provided that there is at least one overlapping Chinese character; Relaxed Match 2 is more rigid which takes into account the overlap text length during scoring. 50 Phase 1: The Detection of Cause Occurrence The detection of cause occurrence is considered a preliminary task for emotion cause recognition and is compounded by the fact that neutral sentences are difficult to detect, as observed in Tokuhisa et al. (2008). For Phase 1, each emotion keyword in a sentence has a binary tag: Y (i.e. with a cause) or N (without a cause). Similar to other NLP tasks, we adopt the common evaluation metrics, i.e. accuracy, precision, recall, and F score. Phase 2: The Detection of Causes The evaluation in Phase 2 is limited to the emotion keywords with a cause either in the gold-standard file or in the system file. The performance is calculated as in Overall Evaluation scheme.

Emotion cause detection is a new research area in emotion processing. In emotion processing, the cause event and emotion correlation is a fertile ground for extraction and entailment of new information. As a first step towards fully automatic inference of causeemotion correlation, we propose a text-driven, rule-based approach to emotion cause detection in this paper. Most theories of emotion treat recognition of a triggering cause event as an integral part of emotional experience (Descartes 1649, James 1884, Plutchik 1962, Wierzbicka 1999). In this study, cause events refer to the explicitly expressed arguments or events that evoke the presence of the corresponding emotions. They are usually expressed by means of propositions, nominalizations, and nominals. For example, “they like it” is the cause event of the emotion happiness in the sentence “I was very happy that they like it”. Note that we only take into account emotions that are explicitly expressed, which are usually presented by emotion keywords, e.g. “This surprises me”. Implicit emotions that require inference or connotation are not processed in this first study. In th</context>
