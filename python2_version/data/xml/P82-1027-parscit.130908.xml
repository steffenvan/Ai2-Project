This paper describes how a language-planning system
can produce natural-language referring expressions that
satisfy multiple goals. It describes a formal representation
for reasoning about several agents&apos; mutual knowledge us-
ing possible-worlds semantics and the general organization
of a system that uses the formalism to reason about plans
combining physical and linguistic actions at different levels
of abstraction. It discusses the planning of concept ac-
tivation actions that are realized by definite referring ex-
pressions in the planned utterances, and shows how it is
possible to integrate physical actions for communicating
intentions with linguistic actions, resulting in plans that
include pointing as one of the communicative actions avail-
able to the speaker.

I. INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.9999265">
One of the most important constituent processes of
natural-language generation is the production of referring
expressions, which occur in almost every utterance. Refer-
ring expressions often carry the burden of informing the
hearer of propositions as well as referring to objects. There-
fore, many phenomena that are observed in dialogues can-

not be explained by the simple view that referring expres-
sions are descriptions of the intended referent sufficient to
distinguish the referent from other objects in the domain
or in focus.
Consider the situation (depicted in Figure 1) in which
two agents, an apprentice and an expert, are cooperating
on a common task, such as disassembling an air compres-
sor. Several tools are lying on the workbench, and al-
though the apprentice knows that the objects are there,
he may not necessarily know where they are. The expert
might say:
Use the wheelpuller to remove the flywheel. (1)
while pointing at the wheelpuller. The apprentice may
think to himself at this point, &amp;quot;Ah, ha, so that&apos;s a wheel-
puller,&amp;quot; and then proceed to remove the flywheel.
What the expert is accomplishing through the utterance
of (1) by using the noun phrase &amp;quot;the wheelpuller&amp;quot; cannot
be fully explained by treating definite referring expressions
simply as descriptions that are uniquely true of some ob-
ject, even taking focusing [71111] into account. The expert
uses &amp;quot;the wheelpuller&amp;quot; to refer to an object that in fact
uniquely fits the description predicated of it, so this simple
analysis is incapable of accounting for the effects the expert
intends his utterance to have.
If one takes the knowledge and intentions of the speaker
and hearer into account, a more accurate account of the
speaker&apos;s use of the referring expression can be developed.
The apprentice does not know what the object is that
fits the description &amp;quot;the wheelpuller&amp;quot;. The expert knows
that the apprentice doesn&apos;t know this, and performs the
pointing action to guarantee that his intentions will be
recognized correctly.
The apprentice must recognize what the expert is try-
ing to communicate by pointing — he must realize that
pointing is not just a random gesture, but is intended by
the speaker to be recognized as a communicative act by
the hearer in much the same way as his utterances are
recognized as communicative acts. Furthermore, the ap-
prentice must recognize how the pointing act is cot related
with the utterance the expert is producing. Although there
is no spee&apos;&apos;.. Jeictic reference in the expert&apos;s utterance, it
is clear that he does not mean the flywheel, since we will
assume that the apprentice can determine that the object

he is pointing to is a tool. The apprentice realizes that
the object the expert is pointing to is the intended referent
of &amp;quot;the wheelpuller,&amp;quot; but in the process, he also acquires
the information that the expert believes the object he is
pointing to is a wheelpuller, and that the expert has also
informed him of that fact.
A language-planning system called KAMP (for Know-
ledge And Modalities Planner) has been developed that
can plan utterances similar to example (1) above, coor-
dinate the linguistic actions with physical actions, and
know that the utterance it plans will have the intended
multiple effects on the hearer. KAMP builds on Cohen and
Perrault&apos;s idea of planning speech acts Fib but extends the
planning activity down to the level of constructing sur-
face English sentences. A detailed description of the en-
tire KAMP system can be found in [2]. The system has
been implemented and tested on examples in a cooperative
equipment assembly domain, such as the one in example
(1). This paper develops and extends some of the ideas of
an early prototype system described in [1].
The reference problems that KAMP addresses are a sub-
set of a more general problem, which, following Cohen [5]
will be called &apos;identification.&apos; Whenever a speaker makes
a definite reference, he intends the hearer to identify some
object in the world as the referent. Identifying a refer-
ent requires that the agent perform some cognitive ac-
tivity, such as the simple case of matching the description
with what he knows, or in some cases plan to perform
perceptual actions that lead to the identification. KAMP
simplifies the problem by not considering perceptual ac-
tions, and assumes that there is some &apos;perceptual field&apos;
common to the participants in a dialogue, and that the
objects that lie within that field are mutually known to
the participants, along with the observable properties and
relations that hold among them.
For example, the speaker and hearer in (1) are assumed
to mutually know the size, shape and location of all objects
on the workbench. The agents may not know unobservable
properties of the objects, such as the fact that a particular
tool is a wheelpuller. Similarly, the participants are as-
sumed to be mutually aware of physical actions that take
place within their perceptual field, without explicitly per-
forming any perceptual actions. When the expert points at
the wheelpuller, the apprentice is simply assumed to know
that he is doing it.

II. KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.949386235294118">
KAMP uses an intensional logic to describe facts about
the world, including the knowledge of agents. The possible-
worlds semantics of this intensional logic is axiomatized in
first-order logic as described by Moore [8]. The axiomatiza-
tion enables KAMP to reason about how the knowledge of
both the speaker and the hearer changes as they perform
actions.
* What it means to identify an object is somewhat problematical.
KAMP assumes that identification means that the referring descrip-
tion conjoined with focusing knowledge picks out the same individual
in all possible worlds consistent with what the agent knows.
Moore&apos;s central idea is to axiomatize operators such as
Know as relations between possible worlds. For example,
if Wo denotes the real world, then Know(John, 1) means
P is true in every possible world that is consistent with
what John knows. This is stated formally in the axiom
schema:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.362616">
Ywi T(wi,Know(A, P))
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96687372">
Vw2 K (A, tvi, w2) 3 T(t02,P).
The predicate T(w , P) means that P is true in possible
world w. The predicate K(A, w2) means that tva is
consistent with what A knows in w1.
Actions are described by treating possible worlds as
state variables, and axiomatizing actions as relations be-
tween possible worlds. Thus, R(E,wi, tit) means that
world w2 is the result of event E happening in world w2.
It is important that a language planning system reason
about mutual knowledge while planning referring expres-
sions [3][5]. Failure to consider the mutual knowledge of
the speaker and hearer can lead to the failure of the refer-
ence. KAMP uses an axiomatization of mutual knowledge
in terms of relations on possible worlds. An agent&apos;s know-
ledge is described as everything that is true in all pos-
sible worlds compatible with his knowledge. The mutual
knowledge of two agents A and B is everything that is
true in the union of the possible worlds compatible with
A&apos;s knowledge and B&apos;s knowledge! To state this fact for-
mally, an individual called the kernel of A and B is defined
such that the set of possible worlds compatible with the
kernel&apos;s knowledge is the set of all worlds compatible with
either A&apos;s knowledge or B&apos;s knowledge. This leads to the
following definition of mutual knowledge:
Vwi T(wi,MutuallyKnow(A, B, P))
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.60375">
(2)
Vw2 K(Kernel(A, B), w1, w2) 3 7(w2, P).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9249756">
In (2), T(w, P) means that the object language proposition
P is true in possible world to, and K(a, w2) is a predi-
cate that describes the relation between possible worlds
that means that w2 is a possible alternative to wi accord-
ing to a&apos;s knowledge. The second axiom needed is:
Vx, wi, w2 K(x, tvt, via) 3 VyK(Kernel(r, y), wi, w2) (3)
Axiom (3) states that the possible worlds consistent with
any agent&apos;s knowledge is a subset of the possible worlds
consistent with the kernel of that agent and any other
agent.

III. THE KAMP PLANNING SYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998298">
KAMP is a multiple-agent planning system designed
around a NOAH-like hierarchical planner [10]. KAMP uses
two descriptions of each action available to the planning
agent: a complete axiomatization of the action using the
possible-worlds approach outlined above, and an action

agents is represented by the union of possible worlds compatible with
their knowledge.

summary consisting of a simplified description of the action
that serves as a heuristic to aid in proposing plans that are
likely to succeed. KAMP forms a plan using the simplified
action summaries first, and then verifies the plan using the
full axiomatization. Since the possible-worlds axioms lend
themselves more efficiently to proving a plan correct than
in generating a plan in the first place, such an approach
results in a system that is considerably more efficient than
one relying on the possible-worlds axioms alone.
Because action summaries represent actions in a sim-
plified form, the planner can ignore details of the effects
of communicative acts to produce a plan that is likely to
work in most circumstances. For example, if a simplified
description of the effects of informing states that the hearer
knows the proposition, then the planner can reason that a
plan to achieve the goal of the hearer knowing P is likely to
include the action of informing him that P is true. In the
relatively unlikely event that this description is inadequate,
this fact will be detected during the verification phase
where the more complete description is invoked.
The flow of control during KAmP&apos;s heuristic plan-gen-
eration phase is similar to that of NOAH&apos;s. If a goal needs
to be satisfied, KAMP searches for actions that can achieve
the goal and inserts them into the plan, along with the
preconditions, which become new goals to be satisfied.
When the entire plan has been expanded to one level of
abstraction, then if there is a lower level, all high-level
actions that have low-level expansions are expanded.
Between each stage of expansion, critics are invoked
that examine the plan for global interactions between ac-
tions, and make changes in the structure of the plan to
avoid the bad effects of the interactions and take advantage
of the beneficial ones. Critics play an important role in the
planning of referring expressions, and their functions are
described more fully in Section W.

acts. Illocutionary acts are speech acts such as inform-
ing and requesting, which are planned at the highest level
without regard for any specific linguistic realization. The
next level consists of surface speech-acts, which are abstrac-
tions of the actions of uttering particular sentences with
particular syntactic structures. At this level the planner
starts making commitments to particular choices in syn-
tactic structure, and linguistic knowledge enters the plan-
ning process. One surface speech-act can realize one or
more illocutionary acts. The next level consists of concept-
activation actions, which entail the planning of descrip-
tions that are mutually believed by the speaker and hearer
to refer to objects in the world. This is the level of abstrac-
tion at which noun phrases for definite reference are plan-
ned. Finally, at the lowest level of abstraction are ut-
terance acts, consisting of the utterance of specific words.

W. PLANNING CONCEPT-ACTIVATION
ACTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981367352941176">
Concept-activation actions describe referring at a high
enough level of abstraction so that they are not constrained
to have purely linguistic realizations. When a concept-
activation action is expanded to a lower level of abstrac-
tion, it can result in the planning of a noun phrase within
the surface speech-act of which the concept activation is a
part, and physical actions such as pointing that also com-
municate the speaker&apos;s intention to refer.
KAMP can plan referential definite noun phrases that
realize concept-activation actions. (The planning of at-
tributive and indefinite referring expressions has not yet
been addressed.) KAMP recognizes the need to plan a
concept activation when it is expanding a surface speech-
act. The surface speech-act is planned with a particular
proposition that the hearer has to come to believe the
speaker wants him to know or want. It is necessary to
include whatever information the hearer needs to recog-
nize what the proposition is, and this leads to the neces-
sity of referring to the particular objects mentioned in the
proposition. The planner often reasons that some objects
do not need to be referred to at all. For example, in re-
questing a hearer to remove the pump from the platform
in an air-compressor assembly task, if the hearer knows
that the pump is attached to the platform and nothing
else, it is not necessary to mention the platform, since it
is sufficient to say &amp;quot;Remove the pump,&amp;quot; for the hearer to
recognize the following proposition:
Want(S, Do(H, Remove(pumpl, platformI))).
The planning of a concept-activation action is similar
to the planning of an illocutionary act in that the speaker
is trying to get the hearer to recognize his intention to
perform the act. This means that all that is necessary
from a high-level planning point of view is that the speaker
perform some action that signals to the hearer that the

speaker wants to refer to the object. This is often done by
incorporating a mutually believed description of the ob-
ject into the utterance, but there is no requirement that
the means by which the speaker communicates this inten-
tion be linguistic. For example, the speaker could point
at an object (almost always a communicative act), or per-
haps throw it at the hearer (not so clearly communicative
but definitely attention-getting. The hearer has to reason
whether there are any communicative intentions behind
the act.)
Since concept-activation actions are planned during the
expansion of surface speech-acts, the actions that realize
them must somehow become part of the utterance being
planned. Therefore, all concept-activation actions are ex-
panded with two components: an intention-communication
component and a surface-linguistic component. The inten-
tion-communication component is an abstraction of the
speaker&apos;s plan to communicate his intention to refer, and
may be realized by a plan that includes physical and lin-
guistic actions. The surface-linguistic component consists
of the realization (in some linguistic expression) of the
intention-communication component as part of the surface
speech-act being planned, which means that the realization
must be grammatically consistent with the sentence.
The following two axiom schemata describe concept
activation in KAMP&apos;s possible worlds representation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.561905714285714">
Vw 1, w2 R(Do(A, Cact(B, C)), wi, w2)
T(wi, Want(A, Active(A, B, C))) A (4)
T(w2, Active(A, B, C))
w2 R(Do(A, Cact(B, C)), w1, w2)
Vw3 K(Kernel(A, B), w2, tv3)
3w4 R(Do(A, Cact(B, C)), w4, wa) A
K(Kernel(A, B), Wj, w4)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9884645">
Axiom schema (4) says that when an agent A performs a
concept activation for an agent B, he must first want the
object C to be active, and as a result of performing it, C
becomes active with respect to A and B. Axiom schema
(5) says that after agent A performs the action, the two
agents A and B mutually know that the action has been
performed.
The consequence for the planner of axiomatizing con-
cept activation as in (4) and (5) is that the problem of ac-
tivating a concept now becomes one of getting the hearer
to know that the speaker wants a particular concept to
be active. This is the role of the intention-communication
component in the expansion of the concept activation.
KAMP knows about two types of actions that produce
knowledge about what concepts a speaker wants to be ac-
tive. One is an action called describe, which is ultimately
expanded into a linguistic description corresponding to the
concept the speaker intends to activate, and the other is
called point, which is a generalized pointing action. The
point action is assumed to directly communicate the inten-
tion to activate a concept, thereby avoiding the problem of
observing a gesture and deciding whether it is a pointing,
or an attempt to scratch an itch.
The following schema defines the describe action:
Ywi w2 R(Do(A,Describe(B, D1,wi, tit) D
T(wi , 3x D* (x) A (Vy D (y) D = y)) F.F. (6)
T(wi, Want(A, Active(A, B, x)))
Axiom (6) says that the precondition for an agent to per-
form an action of describing using a particular description
D is that the speaker wants an object to be active if and
only if it uniquely fits the description predicated of it. In
(6), the symbol D denotes a description consisting of object
language predicates that can be applied to the object being
described. It could be defined as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.572323">
D Xx .(Di(x) A ... A Dn(x))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860923076923">
where the Di(x) are the individual descriptors that com-
prise the description. The symbol D* denotes a similar ex-
pression, which includes all the descriptors of D conjoined
with a set of predicates that describe the focus of the dis-
course.* An axiom similar to (5) is also needed to assert
that the speaker and hearer will mutually know, after the
action is performed, that it has taken place. Therefore, if
the speaker and hearer mutually know of an object that
satisfies 0 in focus, then they mutually know that the
speaker wants it to be active.
The pointing action is much simpler because it does not
require either the speaker or the hearer to know anything
at all about the object.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.488376">
w2 R(Do(A, Point(B, X)), w1, w2)
T(wt, Want(A, Active(A, B, X))). (7)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99928815">
According to the above axiom, if an agent points at an
object, that implies that he wants the object to be active.
As usual, an axiom similar to (5) is required to assert that
the agents mutually know the action has been performed.
Axioms (4) and (5) work together with (6) and (7)
to produce the desired effects. When a speaker utters a
description, or points, he communicates his intention to
refer. When he performs the concept-activation action
by incorporating the surface-linguistic component of his
action into a surface speech-act, his intentions are carried
out. Because the equivalence of axiom (6) can be used
in both directions, if the speaker wants an object to be
active, then one can reason that he knows the description
predicated of it is true.
A major problem facing the planner is deciding when
the necessary conditions obtain to be able to take ad-
vantage of the interactions between (6) and (7). Since this
task involves examining several actions in the plan, it is
performed by a critic called the action-subsumption critic.
This critic notices when the speaker is informing the hearer

of a predication that could be included in the description
associated with a concept activation. When such an in-
teraction is noticed, the critic proposes a modification to
the plan. If the surface-linguistic component does not in-
sist that the modification is impossible given the grammar,
then the action subsumption is carried out.
In example (1), for instance, the expert has a high-level
plan that includes the performance of two illocutionary
acts: requesting that the apprentice remove the pump us-
ing a particular tool (call it tool/), and informing the ap-
prentice that toot/ is a wheelpuller. The action subsump-
tion critic notices that in the request the expert is referring
to to oil and also wants to inform the hearer of a property
of tool/. Therefore, it proposes combining the property of
being a wheelpuller into the description used for referring
to tool/ while making the request.

V. CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987318181818">
This paper has described a formalism for describing the
action of referring in a manner that is useful for a genera-
tion system based on planning, like KAMP. The central
idea is to divide referring into two tasks: an intention-
communication task and a surface-linguistic task. By so
doing, it is possible to axiomatize different actions that
communicate a speaker&apos;s intention to refer. Thus, the
planner is able to produce plans that produce natural-
language referring expressions, but take the larger context
of the speaker&apos;s nonlinguistic actions into account as well.
KAMP currently plans only simple definite reference.
One promising extension of this approach for future re-
search is to extend the active predicate to apply to inten-
sional concepts in addition to the extensional ones now
required for definite reference. We hope this will allow for
the planning of attributive and indefinite reference as well.
KAMP currently does not plan quantified noun phrases,
nor can it refer generically, nor can it refer to collections
of entities. Much basic research needs to be done to ex-
tend KAMP to handle these other cases, but we hope that
the formalism outlined here will provide a good base from
which to investigate these extensions.
