Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969631578948">
We studied contrast and variability in
a corpus of gene names to identify
potential heuristics for use in
performing entity identification in the
molecular biology domain. Based on
our findings, we developed heuristics
for mapping weakly matching gene
names to their official gene names.
We then tested these heuristics against
a large body of Medline abstracts, and
found that using these heuristics can
increase recall, with varying levels of
precision. Our findings also
underscored the importance of good
information retrieval and of the ability
to disambiguate between genes,
proteins, RNA, and a variety of other
referents for performing entity
identification with high precision.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934045045045">
Almost all current approaches to entity
identification are actually not tackling the
identification per se, but rather merely the (still
difficult) location of named entities in text. The
difference between these is that entity location
consists of the (difficult enough) task of
demarcation of the boundaries of names in text,
whereas entity identification consists of the
same thing, plus mapping the located names to
the canonical entities that they refer to. In this
paper we present data on variability in the
orthographic representation of gene names, and
then show how knowledge about that variability
can be used for heuristics that increase recall in
the entity identification task. (We use the term
&amp;quot;gene name&amp;quot; as shorthand for &amp;quot;gene, protein, or
RNA name.&amp;quot;)
To understand why it is important to be able
to map located names to the canonical entities
that they refer to, consider the outcome of
running an information extraction routine with
access only to entity location against a
hypothetical document about rat somatotropin.
It contains the synonymous names rat
somatotropin, somatotropin, and growth
hormone, all of which refer to the same
biomolecule, whose canonical name we will
assume to be somatotropin. (The document is
hypothetical; somatotropin and its synonyms are
not.) Suppose that the paper includes three
separate assertions, of the form somatotropin is
upregulated by X, transcription of rat
somatotropin is blocked by Y, and growth
hormone is expressed by cells of type Z. The
system correctly extracts three assertions, but
incorrectly attributes them to three separate
biomolecules, only one of which is the canonical
form. Now consider the outcome of running an
information extraction routine with access to
entity identification against the same document.
Again, the system extracts three assertions, but
this time all three assertions are correctly
attributed to the same biomolecule, i.e.
somatotropin. Krauthammer et al. (2000), who
are arguably the only researchers who have
attempted to do actual identification as we
define it, have noted that while it is possible to
recognize gene names in the face of variability,
it remains difficult to map the recognized names
to their canonical referents. They point out that
heuristics might be helpful in doing this.
We studied variability in gene names with
an eye toward finding such heuristics. Our goal
was to differentiate between kinds of variability
that tend to differentiate between names with
different referents, e.g. aha vs. aho or ACE1 vs.
ACE2, as opposed to kinds of variability that
only differentiate between synonyms that share
a referent, such as tumour protein homologue
and tumor protein homolog or ACE and ACE1.
We then use data on contrast and variability to
suggest our heuristics. The idea behind using
such heuristics is that an identified entity in
some text that differs minimally from the
canonical name for some entity can be mapped
to that canonically-labelled entity if such
mapping is allowed by some heuristic.
We use the term contrast to describe or refer
to dimensions or features which can be used to
distinguish between two samples of natural
language with different meaning. Issues of
contrast versus variability can be discussed with
reference to individual characters or sequences
of characters, or with reference to more abstract
features, such as orthographic case. In the
molecular biology domain, we will say that
some feature is contrastive if it encodes the
difference between the names of two different
genes. In other words, contrasts occur inter-
entity. We will say that some feature is
(noncontrastively) variable if it differs merely
between synonyms; in other words, variability
occurs within members of a synonym set.
We can trivially identify the contrast
between BRCA1 vs. MHC class I polypeptide-
related sequence C, or between sonic hedgehog
vs. eyeless. What we are really interested in is
minimally different tuples—sets that differ with
respect to only one feature. For instance, we
would want to look at BRCA1 and BRCA2,
which differ with respect to whether the
character at the right edge is 1 or 2, or estrogen
receptor beta and oestrogen receptor beta,
which differ with respect to the presence or
absence of an o at the left edge. Ideally, then,
we are looking for sets of names that differ only
by a single unit. However, the size and scope of
the unit needs further discussion. When dealing
with written language, the unit of concern will
usually be the grapheme. A grapheme may be
as small as a single character, but may also be
considerably longer, e.g. the sequence ough in
dough or through. In this study, we considered
graphemes longer than a single character only in
the case of vowels. Sometimes we will want to
consider tuples that differ with respect to strings
that are considerably larger than a grapheme,
such as a word, or a string of parenthesized
material; this will be discussed further in the
first Methods section. The issue of tuple size
will be discussed there, as well.

dimensions of contrast and
variability
2.1 Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998525822222223">
We examined a large corpus of gene names and
of synonyms for those gene names to determine
what sorts of features are contrastive in gene
names, and what sorts of features can vary
without affecting the referential status of a gene
name. The corpus was derived from the
LocusLink LL_tmpl file (the version on the
LocusLink download site at 2:32 p.m. on Sept.
13, 2001), available by ftp from
ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. This is an
easily readable dump of LocusLink, which
“provides a single query interface to curated
sequence and descriptive information about
genetic loci. It presents information on official
nomenclature, aliases, sequence accessions,
phenotypes, EC numbers, MIM numbers,
UniGene clusters, homology, map locations, and
related web sites”
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/locuslink).
We then pulled out the names and synonyms for
all LocusLink entries for the species Mus
musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Homo
sapiens. We took the fields labelled as
OFFICIAL GENE NAME, PREFERRED
GENE NAME, OFFICIAL SYMBOL,
PREFERRED SYMBOL, PRODUCT,
PREFERRED PRODUCT, ALIAS SYMBOL,
and ALIAS PROT. Some genes were unnamed,
and these were excluded from the analysis. To
our surprise, we also found that some gene
names were duplicated within the same genome-
-e.g., in the M. musculus genome, there are two
genes named reciprocal translocation, Ch4 6
and 7, Adler 17; we filtered out duplicate names
and excluded them, as well. This left 42,608
genes for the mouse, 4457 for the rat, and
25,915 for the human. For each organism, we
created one file containing just gene names, and
for each organism we created a set of files
containing all gene names and their synonyms.
For the gene name file, we used just those fields
labelled OFFICIAL GENE NAME or
PREFERRED GENE NAME; for the combined
name/synonym files, we used all of the fields
given above.

2.2 Finding contrasts in the corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966">
For each species, we pulled out a list of all
names that were indicated as OFFICIAL GENE
NAME or PREFERRED GENE NAME in the
LL_tmpl file. Each name in this file represents
a different gene. We examined the names in this
single large file for contrastive differences.

2.3 Finding noncontrastive variability
in the corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994">
For each species, for each gene, we pulled out
the list of all names that were indicated by any
of the set of labels listed above, and stored them
separately. With each of the many resulting
files (one per gene), we examined the small set
of synonymous names for noncontrastive
variability.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999692">
2.4 Finding minimal tuples
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9934148">
The most obvious way to find minimal tuples
would be to first determine the minimum edit
distance between all pairs of gene names, and
then select all pairs with minimum edit distance
below some cutoff value. However, this
approach would suffer from two obvious flaws.
The first flaw is that it is computationally
expensive, since it is a O(n2)-complex problem.
The second flaw is that it is ineffective. It only
yields tuples of size 2, but in fact sets of
minimally differing gene names occur in sets of
size 3, 4, 5, and even considerably larger, e.g.
the three-member set conserved sequence block
I, conserved sequence block II, and conserved
sequence block III. We chose an alternative
approach to the problem of finding minimal
tuples. It consists of the following steps:
For each gene name
0 transform the gene name to some reduced
form
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.907080222222222">
• using the reduced form as the key in a hash
of keys —&gt; lists, add the full form to a list of
full forms from which that reduced form
was derived
For each key in the hash
• retrieve the list of names that is mapped to
by that key
• if the list of names pointed to by that key
has more than one element, report the list
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995706384615385">
For example, if the input is the list of gene
names gamma-glutamyltransferase 1, gamma-
glutamyltransferase 2, gamma-
glutamyltransferase 3, matrix metalloproteinase
23A, matrix metalloproteinase 23B, and acrosin,
and the transformation that is being applied to
each name consists of deletion of the last
character, then the output will be two lists of &gt; 1
element pointed to by gamma-
glutamyltransferase and matrix
metalloproteinase 23, and one list of a single
element, acrosin. The two lists with &gt; 1
element would be reported as minimal tuples.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.928598">
2.5 Transformations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999850483870968">
We applied four transformations designed to
investigate syntagmatic, or positional, effects.
These consisted of removing the first character,
the first word, the last character, and the last
word.
We applied four transformations designed to
investigate paradigmatic, or content-based,
effects. These consisted of mapping vowel
sequences to a constant string (the purpose of
this being to look at American vs. British
dialectal differences in gene names);
replacement of hyphens with spaces; removal of
parenthesized material; and normalization of
case. These relatively simple transformations
miss a number of categories of differences
between gene names, e.g. single-character
differences in non-edge positions, such as 0
BETA-1 GLOBIN vs. 0 BETA-2 GLOBIN;
single-word differences in non-edge positions,
such as DOPAMINE D1A RECEPTOR vs.
DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTOR; proper substring
relationships, such as EYE vs. EYE2; and
interactions between the features that we did
examine, such as calsequestrin 1 (fast-twitch,
skeletal muscle) vs. calsequestrin 2 (cardiac
muscle), which is not found by any one heuristic
but would be found by the combination of the
parenthesized-material transformation followed
by either of the right-edge transformations.
Nonetheless, they seem like a reasonable
starting point.

Table 1 and Graphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 summarize our
findings on contrast and variability in gene
names.
One surprising finding was that every
paradigmatic dimension of contrast that we
examined turned out to be contrastive in at least
some very small number of cases. We did not
expect hyphenation to ever be contrastive, but
found that within the H. sapiens genome, the
two genes at LocusLink ID&apos;s 51086 and 112858
differ in just that feature, having the names
putative protein-tyrosine kinase and putative
protein tyrosine kinase, respectively. The two
genes at LocusLink ID&apos;s 51251 and 90859 differ
in the same way, being named uridine 5&apos;-
monophosphate hydrolase 1 and uridine 5&apos;
monophosphate hydrolase 1, respectively.

variability, it will likely be helpful to have some
awareness of what species is being discussed.
(In considering these findings, it should be
noted that these results are specific to a
particular version of LocusLink. We were
interested in the extent to which these
unexpected minimal pairs might be erroneous,
so we examined the corresponding LOCUSID’s
in a subsequent revision of the file from several
months later (May 1, 2002, 10:21 a.m.). We
found that some of these entries had been
combined, and some had been assigned an
OFFICIAL_GENE_NAME, but others were
unchanged, and so while we cannot eliminate
the possibility that they are in error and have just
managed to elude the editing process thus far, it
is certainly the case that these anomalous
contrasts continue to exist in the database, and
we have no reason to assume that such names
will not continue to be entered into the database,
erroneously or otherwise, and therefore it
behooves us to consider their implications for
entity identification.)

These findings suggested a set of heuristics for
allowing weakened pattern matches on gene
names. The heuristics are stated as
transformations applied to regular expressions
representing gene names to generate new regular
expressions for the same gene names, but the
heuristics can be applied in other ways as well,
e.g. by grammar-based generation of alternate
forms. The heuristics are listed below:
1. Equivalence of vowel sequences: for any
regular expression representing a gene name,
substitute the regular expression formed by
replacing all vowel sequences with one or more
of any vowel.

<footnote confidence="0.611928636363636">
2. Optionality of hyphens: for any regular
expression representing a gene name, substitute

every hyphen with the disjunction of a hyphen
or a space.
3. Optionality of parenthesized material: for any
regular expression representing a gene name,
substitute the regular expression formed by
making any paired parentheses and the material
they enclose (and surrounding whitespace, as
appropriate) optional.

To evaluate the extent to which each of
these heuristics led to increased entity
recognition, we ran our heuristics against a large
body of Medline abstracts. We counted the
number of entities that were found by an exact
pattern match to a LocusLink name, and counted
the number of additional names that were found
by each heuristic. Although none of our
heuristics specifically addressed
morphologically-induced variability, we also
added a search for pluralized gene names, so
that we could compare the extent to which
recognition of plurals improved recall to the
extent to which our heuristics improved recall.

However, we were concerned about the
possibility of poor precision, i.e. false-positives.
For this reason, we ran our heuristics against the
same body of Medline abstracts, then randomly
selected up to 100 tokens of gene names
suggested by each heuristic (some found less
than 100 tokens in our corpus--see Table 2
above). We labelled each putative gene name
with the canonical gene name that we believed it
to refer to, and then asked a subject matter
expert to evaluate whether the gene names that
we had identified were or were not the gene
names that we believed them to be. The expert
was presented with a three-way forced-choice
paradigm, the options being yes, no, and can&apos;t
tell. It seemed useful to be able to compare the
precision of our technique with the incidence of
false positives from strict pattern matches, so the
expert was also presented with a number of
strict matches (i.e., not identified by our
heuristics) to evaluate, in a quantity roughly
equivalent to the number of heuristically-
suggested names that they were asked to
evaluate. Table 3 shows the results.

We note the following:
1. Even strict pattern matches and forms that
vary only with respect to inflectional
morphology (i.e., the plurals) yield a nontrivial
percentage of false positives—a percentage
which is actually higher than two of our
heuristics (optionality of hyphenation and
optionality of parenthesized material).
2. Two of our heuristics (equivalence of vowel
sequences and case insensitivity) yielded
unexpectedly high rates of false positives. The
vowel sequence heuristic can probably be made
to yield a lower rate by fine-tuning it. For
example, false positives from this heuristic can
be reduced by disregarding any weak matches
that come from one or more name-final upper-
case I’s, since these are commonly used in gene
names to form Roman numerals. The high false
positive rate of the case insensitivity heuristic is
unexpected, and will be investigated further.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999772488888889">
Entity identification is a difficult task whose
success is partly dependent on performance in
other tasks, including disambiguation and
information retrieval. Disambiguation of the
actual referent of an apparent gene or protein
name is even more important than one might
expect. Hatzivassiloglou et al. (2001) points out
the benefits and the difficulties inherent in
distinguishing between genes, proteins, and
RNA; we found that it was also important to
differentiate between genes, proteins, RNA, and
receptors, promoters, antagonists, domains, and
binding sites, as well as diseases, syndromes,
conditions, phenotypes, and mutants, as all of
these were noted by our subject-matter expert as
sources of false positives. Good information
retrieval is clearly also a prerequisite for high-
precision entity identification. In some cases,
false positives arose when (abstracts of)
irrelevant documents were used as input.
Heuristics can be useful tools for increasing
recall in entity identification, as well as for
helping us ensure that we are performing true
entity identification, as opposed to entity
location. Tanabe and Wilbur (in press) point out
the value of combining knowledge sources in
the entity identification task; our heuristics seem
especially promising in part because they are
based on a combination of two sources: (1) the
expertise of NLP application developers about
the sorts of variability that need to be dealt with
in NLP systems (e.g. in text normalization), and
(2) on empirical data about variability in the
names themselves. Future work should
concentrate on three areas. The first is
extending our study of variability to include
other dimensions of contrast, such as the ones
that we point out that our study ignored, so that
we can increase the inventory of heuristics. The
second is integrating our heuristics with a
system that identifies weak matches with gene
names, i.e. candidates for application of the
heuristics. The third is elucidating the place of
orthographic variability within all causes of

<abstract confidence="0.935846803571429">We studied contrast and variability in a corpus of gene names to identify potential heuristics for use in performing entity identification in the molecular biology domain. Based on our findings, we developed heuristics for mapping weakly matching gene names to their official gene names. We then tested these heuristics against a large body of Medline abstracts, and found that using these heuristics can increase recall, with varying levels of precision. Our findings underscored the importance of good information retrieval and of the ability to disambiguate between genes, proteins, RNA, and a variety of other referents for performing entity identification with high precision. Almost all current approaches to entity identification are actually not tackling the identification per se, but rather merely the (still difficult) location of named entities in text. The difference between these is that entity location consists of the (difficult enough) task of demarcation of the boundaries of names in text, whereas entity identification consists of the same thing, plus mapping the located names to the canonical entities that they refer to. In this paper we present data on variability in the orthographic representation of gene names, and then show how knowledge about that variability can be used for heuristics that increase recall in the entity identification task. (We use the term &amp;quot;gene name&amp;quot; as shorthand for &amp;quot;gene, protein, or RNA name.&amp;quot;) To understand why it is important to be able to map located names to the canonical entities that they refer to, consider the outcome of running an information extraction routine with access only to entity location against a hypothetical document about rat somatotropin. contains the synonymous names somatotropin, of which refer to the same biomolecule, whose canonical name we will to be document is hypothetical; somatotropin and its synonyms are not.) Suppose that the paper includes three assertions, of the form is upregulated by X, transcription of rat is blocked by Y, is expressed by cells of type Z. system correctly extracts three assertions, but incorrectly attributes them to three separate biomolecules, only one of which is the canonical form. Now consider the outcome of running an information extraction routine with access to entity identification against the same document. Again, the system extracts three assertions, but this time all three assertions are correctly attributed to the same biomolecule, i.e. somatotropin. Krauthammer et al. (2000), who are arguably the only researchers who have attempted to do actual identification as we define it, have noted that while it is possible to recognize gene names in the face of variability, it remains difficult to map the recognized names to their canonical referents. They point out that heuristics might be helpful in doing this. We studied variability in gene names with an eye toward finding such heuristics. Our goal was to differentiate between kinds of variability that tend to differentiate between names with referents, e.g. opposed to kinds of variability that only differentiate between synonyms that share referent, such as protein homologue protein homolog We then use data on contrast and variability to suggest our heuristics. The idea behind using such heuristics is that an identified entity in some text that differs minimally from the canonical name for some entity can be mapped to that canonically-labelled entity if such mapping is allowed by some heuristic. use the term describe or refer to dimensions or features which can be used to distinguish between two samples of natural language with different meaning. Issues of contrast versus variability can be discussed with reference to individual characters or sequences of characters, or with reference to more abstract features, such as orthographic case. In the molecular biology domain, we will say that some feature is contrastive if it encodes the difference between the names of two different genes. In other words, contrasts occur interentity. We will say that some feature is (noncontrastively) variable if it differs merely between synonyms; in other words, variability occurs within members of a synonym set. We can trivially identify the contrast class I polypeptidesequence C, between hedgehog we are really interested in is minimally different tuples—sets that differ with respect to only one feature. For instance, we want to look at which differ with respect to whether the at the right edge is beta receptor beta, which differ with respect to the presence or of an the left edge. Ideally, then, we are looking for sets of names that differ only by a single unit. However, the size and scope of the unit needs further discussion. When dealing with written language, the unit of concern will usually be the grapheme. A grapheme may be as small as a single character, but may also be longer, e.g. the sequence this study, we considered graphemes longer than a single character only in the case of vowels. Sometimes we will want to consider tuples that differ with respect to strings that are considerably larger than a grapheme, such as a word, or a string of parenthesized material; this will be discussed further in the The issue of tuple size will be discussed there, as well. I: Investigating dimensions of contrast and variability 2.1 Corpus We examined a large corpus of gene names and of synonyms for those gene names to determine what sorts of features are contrastive in gene names, and what sorts of features can vary without affecting the referential status of a gene name. The corpus was derived from the (the version on the LocusLink download site at 2:32 p.m. on Sept. 13, 2001), available by ftp from This is an easily readable dump of LocusLink, which “provides a single query interface to curated sequence and descriptive information about genetic loci. It presents information on official nomenclature, aliases, sequence accessions, phenotypes, EC numbers, MIM numbers, UniGene clusters, homology, map locations, and related web We then pulled out the names and synonyms for all LocusLink entries for the species Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Homo sapiens. We took the fields labelled OFFICIAL GENE NAME, PREFERRED GENE NAME, OFFICIAL SYMBOL, PREFERRED SYMBOL, PRODUCT, PREFERRED PRODUCT, ALIAS SYMBOL, and ALIAS PROT. Some genes were unnamed, and these were excluded from the analysis. To our surprise, we also found that some gene names were duplicated within the same genome- -e.g., in the M. musculus genome, there are two named translocation, Ch4 6 7, Adler 17; filtered out duplicate names and excluded them, as well. This left 42,608 genes for the mouse, 4457 for the rat, and 25,915 for the human. For each organism, we created one file containing just gene names, and for each organism we created a set of files containing all gene names and their synonyms. For the gene name file, we used just those fields labelled OFFICIAL GENE NAME or PREFERRED GENE NAME; for the combined name/synonym files, we used all of the fields given above. 2.2 Finding contrasts in the corpus For each species, we pulled out a list of all names that were indicated as OFFICIAL GENE NAME or PREFERRED GENE NAME in the Each name in this file represents a different gene. We examined the names in this single large file for contrastive differences. 2.3 Finding noncontrastive variability in the corpus For each species, for each gene, we pulled out the list of all names that were indicated by any of the set of labels listed above, and stored them separately. With each of the many resulting files (one per gene), we examined the small set of synonymous names for noncontrastive variability. 2.4 Finding minimal tuples The most obvious way to find minimal tuples would be to first determine the minimum edit distance between all pairs of gene names, and then select all pairs with minimum edit distance below some cutoff value. However, this approach would suffer from two obvious flaws. The first flaw is that it is computationally since it is a problem. The second flaw is that it is ineffective. It only yields tuples of size 2, but in fact sets of minimally differing gene names occur in sets of size 3, 4, 5, and even considerably larger, e.g. three-member set sequence block conserved sequence block II, block III. chose an alternative approach to the problem of finding minimal tuples. It consists of the following steps: For each gene name the gene name to some reduced form • using the reduced form as the key in a hash keys add the full form to a list of full forms from which that reduced form was derived For each key in the hash • retrieve the list of names that is mapped to by that key • if the list of names pointed to by that key has more than one element, report the list For example, if the input is the list of gene 1, gamma- 2, glutamyltransferase 3, matrix metalloproteinase matrix metalloproteinase 23B, and the transformation that is being applied to each name consists of deletion of the last character, then the output will be two lists of &gt; 1 pointed to by gamma- 23, one list of a single two lists with &gt; 1 element would be reported as minimal tuples. 2.5 Transformations We applied four transformations designed to investigate syntagmatic, or positional, effects. These consisted of removing the first character, the first word, the last character, and the last word. We applied four transformations designed to investigate paradigmatic, or content-based, effects. These consisted of mapping vowel sequences to a constant string (the purpose of this being to look at American vs. British dialectal differences in gene names); replacement of hyphens with spaces; removal of parenthesized material; and normalization of case. These relatively simple transformations miss a number of categories of differences between gene names, e.g. single-character in non-edge positions, such as GLOBIN BETA-2 GLOBIN; single-word differences in non-edge positions, as D1A RECEPTOR D2 RECEPTOR; substring such as interactions between the features that we did such as 1 (fast-twitch, muscle) 2 (cardiac is not found by any one heuristic but would be found by the combination of the parenthesized-material transformation followed by either of the right-edge transformations. Nonetheless, they seem like a reasonable starting point. I Table 1 and Graphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 summarize our findings on contrast and variability in gene names. One surprising finding was that every paradigmatic dimension of contrast that we examined turned out to be contrastive in at least some very small number of cases. We did not expect hyphenation to ever be contrastive, but found that within the H. sapiens genome, the two genes at LocusLink ID&apos;s 51086 and 112858 differ in just that feature, having the names protein-tyrosine kinase tyrosine kinase, The two genes at LocusLink ID&apos;s 51251 and 90859 differ the same way, being named 5&apos;hydrolase 1 5&apos; hydrolase 1, Graph 1.

In interpreting variability, it will likely be helpful to have some awareness of what species is being discussed. (In considering these findings, it should be noted that these results are specific to a particular version of LocusLink. We were interested in the extent to which these unexpected minimal pairs might be erroneous, so we examined the corresponding LOCUSID’s in a subsequent revision of the file from several months later (May 1, 2002, 10:21 a.m.). We found that some of these entries had been combined, and some had been assigned an OFFICIAL_GENE_NAME, but others were unchanged, and so while we cannot eliminate the possibility that they are in error and have just managed to elude the editing process thus far, it is certainly the case that these anomalous contrasts continue to exist in the database, and we have no reason to assume that such names will not continue to be entered into the database, erroneously or otherwise, and therefore it behooves us to consider their implications for entity identification.) Graph 3. Parenthesized material: contrast and variability Contrastive Synonymous We found marked edge effects. Contrasts are much more likely to be marked at the name boundary than are noncontrastive differences. There is a marked asymmetry in the directionality of the location of contrastive differences: they are much more likely to appear at the right edge of the word than at the left edge of the word. There are also marked intra-species differences. For example, although large edge effects are obvious for names (as opposed to synonyms) in the mouse and human genomes, Names</abstract>

Edge contrastive on synonymous on right 4 Methods II: Testing the heuristics These findings suggested a set of heuristics for allowing weakened pattern matches on gene names. The heuristics are stated transformations applied to regular expressions representing gene names to generate new regular expressions for the same gene names, but the heuristics can be applied in other ways as well, e.g. by grammar-based generation of alternate forms. The heuristics are listed below: 1. Equivalence of vowel sequences: for any regular expression representing a gene name, substitute the regular expression formed by replacing all vowel sequences with one or more of any vowel. 2. Optionality of hyphens: for any regular expression representing a gene name, substitute the regular expression formed by replacing every hyphen with the disjunction of a hyphen or a space. 3. Optionality of parenthesized material: for any regular expression representing a gene name, substitute the regular expression formed by making any paired parentheses and the material they enclose (and surrounding whitespace, as appropriate) optional.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.994202812949641">4. Case insensitivity: for any regular expression, apply it case-insensitively. To evaluate the extent to which each of these heuristics led to increased entity recognition, we ran our heuristics against a large body of Medline abstracts. We counted the number of entities that were found by an exact pattern match to a LocusLink name, and counted the number of additional names that were found by each heuristic. Although none of our heuristics specifically morphologically-induced variability, we also added a search for pluralized gene names, so that we could compare the extent to which recognition of plurals improved recall to the extent to which our heuristics improved recall. 5 Results II Table 2 shows the results. As intuition would suggest, all heuristics were effective in locating more names than strict pattern matches alone. For example, optional hyphenation heuristic the official gene name find a match in C5a also enhanced transcription of the gene for the acute phase protein 2macroglobulinn HC indirectly by increasing LPS-dependent IL-6 release from KC. names located by strict pattern matching 1846 Additional names located by vowel 586 sequence heuristic matches Additional names located by optional hyphen heuristic matches 37 Additional names located by case 864 insensitive heuristic matches Additional names located by optional parentheses heuristic matches 432 Additional names located by plural 87 matches Table 2. Names found by strict pattern match, heuristics, and plurals. However, we were concerned about the possibility of poor precision, i.e. false-positives. For this reason, we ran our heuristics against the same body of Medline abstracts, then randomly selected up to 100 tokens of gene names suggested by each heuristic (some found less than 100 tokens in our corpus--see Table 2 above). We labelled each putative gene name with the canonical gene name that we believed it to refer to, and then asked a subject matter expert to evaluate whether the gene names that we had identified were or were not the gene names that we believed them to be. The expert was presented with a three-way forced-choice the options being no, seemed useful to be able to compare the precision of our technique with the incidence of false positives from strict pattern matches, so the expert was also presented with a number of strict matches (i.e., not identified by our heuristics) to evaluate, in a quantity roughly equivalent to the number of heuristicallysuggested names that they were asked to evaluate. Table 3 shows the results. condition tokens marked yes marked no tell” ((can’t + tokens) 100 Vowel seq. 100 15 81 4 85.0 Hyph. 37 34 0 3 8.1 Case insens. 97 72 20 5 25.8 Paren.

Even strict pattern matches and forms that vary only with respect to inflectional morphology (i.e., the plurals) yield a nontrivial percentage of false positives—a percentage which is actually higher than two of our heuristics (optionality of hyphenation and optionality of parenthesized material). 2. Two of our heuristics (equivalence of vowel sequences and case insensitivity) yielded unexpectedly high rates of false positives. The vowel sequence heuristic can probably be made to yield a lower rate by fine-tuning it. For example, false positives from this heuristic can be reduced by disregarding any weak matches that come from one or more name-final uppersince these are commonly used in gene names to form Roman numerals. The high false positive rate of the case insensitivity heuristic is unexpected, and will be investigated further. 6 Conclusions Entity identification is a difficult task whose success is partly dependent on performance in other tasks, including disambiguation and information retrieval. Disambiguation of the actual referent of an apparent gene or protein name is even more important than one might expect. Hatzivassiloglou et al. (2001) points out the benefits and the difficulties inherent in distinguishing between genes, proteins, and RNA; we found that it was also important to differentiate between genes, proteins, RNA, and receptors, promoters, antagonists, domains, and binding sites, as well as diseases, syndromes, conditions, phenotypes, and mutants, as all of these were noted by our subject-matter expert as sources of false positives. Good information retrieval is clearly also a prerequisite for highprecision entity identification. In some cases, false positives arose when (abstracts of) irrelevant documents were used as input. Heuristics can be useful tools for increasing recall in entity identification, as well as for helping us ensure that we are performing true entity identification, as opposed to entity location. Tanabe and Wilbur (in press) point out the value of combining knowledge sources in the entity identification task; our heuristics seem especially promising in part because they are based on a combination of two sources: (1) the expertise of NLP application developers about the sorts of variability that need to be dealt with in NLP systems (e.g. in text normalization), and (2) on empirical data about variability in the names themselves. Future work should concentrate on three areas. The first is extending our study of variability to include other dimensions of contrast, such as the ones that we point out that our study ignored, so that we can increase the inventory of heuristics. The second is integrating our heuristics with a system that identifies weak matches with gene names, i.e. candidates for application of the heuristics. The third is elucidating the place of orthographic variability within all causes of pattern match failure.</abstract>
