We introduce CST (cross-document
structure theory), a paradigm for multi-
document analysis. CST takes into account
the rhetorical structure of clusters of related
textual documents. We present a taxonomy
of cross-document relationships. We argue
that CST can be the basis for multi-
document summarization guided by user
preferences for summary length, information
provenance, cross-source agreement, and
chronological ordering of facts.

The Topic Detection and Tracking model (TDT)
[Allan et al. 98] describes news events as they
are reflected in news sources. First, many
sources write on the same event and, second, the
same source typically produces a number of
accounts of the event over a period of time.
Sixteen news stories related to the same event
from six news sources over a two-hour time
period are represented in Figure 1.

A careful analysis of related news articles shows
that they exhibit some interesting properties
[Radev &amp; McKeown 98]. In some cases,
different sources agree with each other, at other
times, the information presented in them is
contradictory. The same source sometimes adds
new information as it becomes available and
puts it in the context of what has already been
discussed earlier. In other cases, to get a full
picture of an event, one has to read stories from
multiple sources as neither of them presents all
relevant information. All these examples point
to the existence of cross-document structure that
is waiting to be exploited.
Figure 2 illustrates how the same story can be
told in several different ways. The six extracts
are from news stories about the same event: the
declaration by Bill Clinton at a press conference
that millions of dollars will be handed out to low
income people affected by recent surges in oil
prices.
In this paper we introduce CST, a theory of
cross-document structure. CST assigns labels

such as subsumption, update, and elaboration to
cross-document conceptual links. We argue that
CST. is essential for the analysis of
contradiction, redundancy, and complementarity
in related documents and for multi-document
summarization (MDS).
FoxNews: President Clinton announced Wednesday he will release funds to help New Englanders through the
heating oil &amp;quot;crisis&amp;quot; and spoke on topics ranging from gun violence to his personal life and foreign policy.
The president said he ordered the release of $125 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to
help families who must rely on oil to heat their homes. He said that amount was all that is left in the fund this year.
ABCNews: President Clinton today ordered the release of millions of dollars in assistance for Northeastern families
struggling with soaring fuel costs, saying Americans have together to help their fellow citizens in times of need.
The release of $120 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program is to help families who must

CNN: Citing rising energy costs, President Clinton said Wednesday he is releasing $120 million in funds to help
families buy home heating oil in the mid-Atlantic and northeastern states.
The president said he decided the help was needed because steadily rising oil prices have slammed consumers
dependent on home heating oil and have boosted the cost of gasoline.
MSNBC: AT A WASHINGTON, D.C. news conference, Clinton announced that he had ordered the release of the
remainder of federal heating assistance money to help families in the Northeast hit hard by this year&apos;s cold weather
and the soaring cost of home heating oil.
Clinton said he ordered the release of $125 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help
families who must rely on oil to heat their homes. He said that amount was all that is left in the fund this year.
USA Today: President Clinton, saying too many families are being hurt by the soaring cost of heating their homes,
announced Wednesday he will ask Congress for $600 million in emergency assistance to help people meet heating
oil costs. He also released an additional $125 million for more immediate help to low-income families.
NY Times: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 â€” President Clinton ordered the release today of another $125 million in
government aid to help needy families pay the soaring costs of heating their homes this winter.
The release, announced by Mr. Clinton at the start of a White House news conference this afternoon, comes only six
days after the government made $130 million in home-heating aid available.

Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [Mann &amp;
Thompson 88, Mann 00] is a comprehensive
theory of text organization. It is based on &amp;quot;text
coherence&amp;quot;, or the presence in &amp;quot;carefully written
text&amp;quot; of unity that would not appear in random
sequences of sentences. RST posits the existence
of relations among sentences. Most relations
consist of one or more nuclei (the central
components of a rhetorical relation) and zero or
more satellites (the supporting components of
the relation). An example of an RST relation is
evidence which is decomposed into a nucleus (a
claim) and a satellite (text that supports the
claim). RST is intentionally limited to single
documents. With CST, we attempt to describe
the rhetorical structure of sets of related
documents. Unlike RST, CST cannot rely on the
deliberateness of writing style. We can however
make use of some observations of structure
across documents which, while clearly not
deliberate in the RST sense, can be quite
predictable and useful. In a sense, CST
associates a certain behavior to a &amp;quot;collective
document author&amp;quot; (that is, the collectivity of all
authors of the related documents).
A pioneering study in the typology of links
among documents is described in [Trigg 83,
Trigg &amp; Weiser 87]. Trigg introduces a
taxonomy of link types across scientific papers.
The 80 suggested link types such as citation,
refutation, revision, equivalence, and
comparison are grouped in two categories:
Normal (inter-document links) and Commentary
(deliberate cross-document links). While the
taxonomy is quite exhaustive, it is by no means
appropriate or intended for general domain texts
(that is, other than scientific articles).

A large deal of research in the automatic
induction of document and hyperdocument
structure is due to Salton&apos;s group at Cornell
[Salton et al. 91]. [Allan 96] presents a graph
simplification technique for &amp;quot;hyperlink typing&amp;quot;,
that is, assigning link types from Trigg&apos;s list to
links between sentences or paragraphs of a pair
of documents. Allan tested his techniques on
sets of very distinct articles (e.g. &amp;quot;John F.
Kennedy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;United States of America&amp;quot; from
the Funk and Wagnalls encyclopedia). As the
author himself admits, the evaluation in [Allan
96] is very weak and doesn&apos;t indicate to any
extent whether the techniques actually achieve
anything useful.
More recently, [Salton et al. 97] introduced a
technique for document structuring based on
semantic hyperlinks (among pairs of paragraphs
which are related by a lexical similarity
significantly higher than random). The authors
represent single documents from the Funk and
Wagnalls encyclopedia on topics such as
Abortion or Nuclear Weapons in the form of text
relationship maps. These maps exploit the
bushiness (or number of connecting edges) of a
paragraph to decide whether to include it in a
summary of the entire article. The assumption
underlying their technique is that bushy paths (or
paths connecting highly connected paragraphs)
are more likely to contain information central to
the topic of the article. The summarization
techniques described in Salton et al.&apos;s research
are limited to single documents.
One of the goals of CST is to extend the
techniques set forth in Trigg, Salton, and Allan&apos;s
work to cover sets of related documents in
arbitrary domains.

2.2 Multi-document summarization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9963051">
SUMMONS [Radev &amp; McKeown 98] is a
knowledge-based multi-document
summarization system, which produces
summaries of a small number of news articles
within the domain of terrorism. SUMMONS
uses as input a set of semantic templates
extracted by a message understanding system
[Fisher et al. 96] and identifies some patterns in
them such as change of perspective,
contradiction, refinement, agreement, and
elaboration. The techniques used in SUMMONS
involved a large amount of knowledge
engineering even for a relatively small domain
of text (such as accounts of terrorist events) and
is not directly suitable for domain-independent
text analysis. The planning operators used in it
present, however, the ideal first step towards
CST.
[Mani &amp; Bloedom 99] use similarities and
differences among related news articles for
MDS. They measure the effectiveness of their
method in two scenarios: paragraph alignment
across two articles and query-based information
retrieval. None of these scenarios evaluates the
generation of query-independent summaries of
multiple articles in open domains.
The Stimulate projects at Columbia University
[Barzilay &amp; al. 99], [McKeown &amp; al. 99] have
been using natural language generation to
produce multi-document summaries. Their
technique is called theme intersection: paragraph
alignment across news stories with the help of a
semantic network to identify phrases which
convey the same meaning and then generate new
sentences from each theme and order them
chronologically to produce a summary.
We should note here that RST has been used to
produce single-document summaries [Marcu
97]. For multi-document summaries, CST can
present a reasonable equivalent to RST.

Time-dependent documents are related to the
observation that perception of an event changes
over time and include (a) evolving summaries
(summaries of new documents related to an
ongoing event that are presented to the user
assuming that he or she has read earlier
summaries of related documents) [Radev 99]
and (b) chronological briefings [Radev &amp;
McKeown 98]. [Carbonell et al. 98] discuss the
motivation behind the use of time-dependent
documents and [Berger &amp; Miller 98] describe a
language model for time-dependent corpora.

Definition A multi-document cube C (see Figure

represents related documents. The three
dimensions are t (time), s (source) and p

Definition A document unit U is a tuple (t,s,p) â€”

at different levels of granularity, e.g.,
paragraphs, sentences, or words.

a one-dimensional projection of a multi-

Some additional concepts can be defined based
on the above definitions.

While multi-document cubes are a useful
abstraction, they cannot easily represent text
simultaneously at different levels of granularity
(words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and
documents). The second formalism that we
introduce is the multi-document graph. Each
graph consists of smaller subgraphs for each
individual document (Figure 4). We use two
types of links. The first type represents
inheritance relationships among elements within
a single document. These links are drawn using
thicker lines. The second type represents
semantic relationships among textual units. The
example illustrates sample links among
documents, phrases, sentences, and phrases.

5 Using CST for information fusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999649125">
In this section we describe how CST can be used
to generate personalized multi-document
summaries from clusters of related articles in
four steps: clustering, document structure
analysis, link analysis, and personalized graph-
based summarization (Figure 6).
The first stage, clustering, can be either query-
independent (e.g., based on pure document
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992878">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.985998142857143">
similarity [Allan et al. 98]) or based on a user
query (in which case clusters will be the sets of
documents returned by a search engine).
The second stage, document analysis, includes
the generation of document trees representing
the sentential and phrasal structure of the
document [Hearst 94, Kan et al. 98].
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.9999815">
Figure 6: Processing stages
Figure 7: Summarization using graph cover operators
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915814814815">
The third stage is the automatic creation and
typing of links among textual spans across
documents. Four techniques for identifying
related textual units across documents can be
used: lexical distance, lexical chains,
information extraction, and linguistic template
matching. Lexical distance (see e.g., [Allan
96]) uses cosine similarity across pairs of
sentences. Lexical chains [Barzilay &amp; Elhadad
97] are more robust than lexical matching as
they take into account linguistic phenomena
such as synonymy and hypemymy. The third
technique, information extraction [Radev &amp;
McKeown 98] identifies salient semantic roles
in text (e.g., the place, perpetrator, and effect
of a terrorist event) and converts them to
semantic templates. Two textual units are
considered related whenever their semantic
templates are related. Finally, a technique that
will be used to identify some relationships
such as citation, contradiction, and attribution
is template matching which takes into account
transformational grammar (e.g., relative clause
insertion). For link type analysis, machine
learning using lexical metrics and cue words is
most appropriate (see [Kupiec et al. 95],
[Cohen &amp; Singer 96]).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996744">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.927765434782609">
The final step is summary extraction, based on
the user-specified constraints on the
summarizer. A graph-based operator defines a
transformation on a multi-document graph
(MDG) G which preserves some of its
properties while reducing the number of
nodes. An example of such an operator is the
link-preserving graph cover operator (Figure
7). Its effect is to preserve only these nodes
from the source MDG that are associated with
the preferred cross-document links. In the
example, the shaded area represents the
summary subgraph G&apos; of G that contains all
four cross-document links and only these
nodes and edges of G which are necessary to
preserve the textual structure of G&apos;.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985714285714">
We are in the process of performing a user
study to collect interagreement data among
judges who are asked to label cross-document
rhetorical relations.
We are also currently building a system for
automatic identification of relationships in
document clusters as well as a library of
summarization operators. User preferences are
used to constrain the summarizers. For
example, a user may prefer that in the event of
contradiction, both sources of information
should be represented in the summary.
Another user may have preferences for a given
source over all others and choose an operator
which will only reflect his preferred source.
We will facilitate the user&apos;s navigation in the
space of all possible summarizers. By
specifying their preferences, users will build
their own summarizers and test them on a
collection of documents and then refine them
to fit their needs.

6.2 Conclusion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99979925">
We introduced a theory of cross-document
structure based on inter-document
relationships such as paraphrase, citation,
attribution, modality, and development. We
presented a taxonomy of cross-document
links. We argued that a CST-based analysis of
related documents can facilitate multi-
document summarization.

CST takes into account the rhetorical structure of clusters of related textual documents. We present a taxonomy of cross-document relationships. We argue that CST can be the basis for multidocument summarization guided by user preferences for summary length, information provenance, cross-source agreement, and chronological ordering of facts.</abstract>
