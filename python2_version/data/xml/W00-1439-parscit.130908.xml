We present a- theory-awsyntactic, projection., arguing that ,aspectuaksyntactic -structure is
directly projected from a limited inventory of lexical semantic components. Only lexical
meaning components, necessary in any case for interpretation, can project structure. In our
approach, the lexicon is not a separate level of representation with its own restrictions; we
offer a structural account for what has hitherto been accounted for in terms of argument
(number) specification, theta-roles, and mapping conditions.
Each lexical semantic component projects a V-complement structure, the complement
typically realizing the categorical type of the component, as shown:

V V V M = manner/means/instrument
1 1 / 1 / 1 S = state
V N V A V P L = location
I I I
WI Vs VI_
The full projections correspond roughly to the Vendler-Dowty aspectual classes:
process/ change-of-state/ cause + change of state/
activity achievement accomplishment
V V V
/ 1 / 1 / / 1

Projection is free. Transitivity thus follows from the number of projected meaning
components and crucially from the availability of an interpretation for each component in a
particular projection.
Unprojected components are aspectually defoeussed (backgrounded) and are interpreted as
modifiers. Such aspectual defocussing also accounts for the variety of constructions in which
different verbs can occur, e.g. the contrast between break and cur, which does not allow *The
cake cia.
We demonstrate how a combination of semantic component projection and aspectual focus
accounts for the possibilities of verbal distribution and interpretation.
