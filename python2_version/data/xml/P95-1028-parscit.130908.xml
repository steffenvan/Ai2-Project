Traditional approaches to quantifier scope
typically need stipulation to exclude rea-
dings that are unavailable to human under-
standers. This paper shows that quantifier
scope phenomena can be precisely charac-
terized by a semantic representation cons-
trained by surface constituency, if the di-
stinction between referential and quantifi-
cational NPs is properly observed. A CCG
implementation is described and compared

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959785714286">
It is generally assumed that sentences with multi-
ple quantified NPs are to be interpreted by one or
more unambiguous logical forms in which the scope
of traditional logical quantifiers determines the rea-
ding or readings. There are two problems with this
assumption: (a) without further stipulation there is
a tendency to allow too many readings and (b) there
is considerable confusion as to how many readings
should be allowed arising from contamination of the
semantics of many NL quantifiers by referentiality.
There are two well-known techniques for redis-
tributing quantifiers in quantification structures:
quantifying-in (Montague, 1974; Cooper, 1983; Kel-
ler, 1988; Carpenter, 1994) and quantifier raising
(May, 1985). The former provides a compositio-
nal way of putting possibly embedded quantifiers
to the scope-taking positions, and the latter utili-
zes a syntactic movement operation at the level of
semantics for quantifier placement. There are also
approaches that put more emphasis on utilizing con-
textual information in restricting the generation of
semantic forms by choosing a scope-neutral repre-
sentation augmented with ordering constraints to
capture linguistic judgments (Webber, 1979; Kamp,
1981; Heim, 1983; Poesio, 1991; Reyle, 1993). And
there are computational approaches that screen una-
vailable and/or redundant semantic forms (Hobbs &amp;
Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988; Vestre, 1991). This pa-
per will show that these approaches allow unavaila-
ble readings, and thereby miss an important gene-
ralization concerning the readings that actually are
available.
This paper examines English constructions that
allow multiple occurrences of quantified NPs: NP
modifications, transitive or ditransitive verbs, that
complements, and coordinate structures. Based on
a critical analysis of readings that are available from
these data, the claim is that scope phenomena can
be characterized by a combination of syntactic sur-
face adjacency and semantic function-argument re-
lationship. This characterization will draw upon the
old distinction between referential and quantificatio-
nal NP-semantics (Fodor &amp; Sag, 1982). We choose
to use Combinatory Categorial Grammar to show
how surface adjacency affects semantic function-
argument relationship, since CCG has the flexibility
of composing almost any pair of adjacent constitu-
ents with a precise notion of syntactic grammatica-
lity (Steedman, 1990; 1993).1
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First,
we discuss in ยง2 how traditional techniques address
availability of readings and note some residual pro-
blems. Then we give a brief analysis of available
readings (ยง3), a generalization of the analysis (ยง4),
and finally describe a computational implementation
in Prolog (ยง5).

2 Traditional Approaches

<bodyText confidence="0.999367545454545">
All three paradigms of grammar formalisms intro-
duced earlier share similar linguistic judgments for
their grammaticality analyses. This section exami-
nes quantifying-in to show (a) that quantifying-
in is a powerful device that allows referential NP-
interpretations and (b) that quantifying-in is not suf-
ficiently restricted to account for the available rea-
dings for quantificational NP-interpretations.
Quantifying-in is a technique originally introdu-
ced to produce appropriate semantic forms for de
re interpretations of NPs inside opaque operators

<footnote confidence="0.948804666666667">
&apos;For instance, the result would transfer to Synchro-
nous Tree Adjoining Grammar (Shieber &amp; Schabes,

(Montague, 1974). For example, (a) below has two
readings, de re and de dicto, depending on the rela-
tivity of the existence of such an individual. They
are roughly interpretable as (b) and (c).2

<listItem confidence="0.629094666666667">
(I) (a) John believes that a Republican will win.
(b) 3r.repub(r) A bel(john, will(sin(r)))

<bodyText confidence="0.977043368421053">
(b) has a binder 3 that is quantifying a variable r
inside an opaque operator bel, hence the name for
the technique. (c) does not have such an interven-
ing operator. Although it is beyond the scope of the
present paper to discuss further details of intensio-
nality, it is clear that de re interpretations of NPs
are strongly related to referential NP-semantics, in
the sense that the de re reading of (a) is about a
referred individual and not about an arbitrary such
individual. Quantifying-in is designed to make any
(possibly embedded) NP take the matrix scope, by
leaving a scoped variable in the argument position
of the original NP. This would be acceptable for re-
ferential NP-semantics.
Montague also proposed to capture purely exten-
sional scope ambiguities using quantifying-in. For
example, wide scope reading of a woman in (a) below
is accounted for by quantifying-in (with a meaning
postulate), patterned after one for (b).

(2) (a) Every man loves a woman.
(b) Every man seeks a white unicorn.

<bodyText confidence="0.999790333333333">
His suggestion is adopted with various subsequent
revisions cited earlier. Since any NP, referential or
quantificational, requires quantifying-in to outscope
another, quantifying-in consequently confounds re-
ferential and quantificational NP-semantics. This
causes a problem when there is a distributional dif-
ference between referential NPs and non-referential
NPs, as Fodor &amp; Sag (1982) have argued, a view
which has been followed by the approaches to dy-
namic interpretation of indefinite NPs cited earlier.
It seems hard to reconcile quantifying-in with these
observations.

3 Availability of Readings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99932975">
This section proposes a way of sharpening our intui-
tion on available readings and re-examines traditio-
nal linguistic judgments on grammatical readings.
While there are undoubted differences in degree
of availability among readings dependent upon se-
mantics or discourse preference (Bunt, 1985; Moran,
1988), we will focus on all-or-none structural possi-
bilities afforded by competence grammar.3
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.8888882">
2In this simplistic notation, we gloss over tense ana-
lysis, among others.
&apos;Moran&apos;s preference-based algorithm treats certain
readings as &amp;quot;highly unpreferred,&amp;quot; effectively making
them structurally unavailable, from those possible sco-
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993462">
Consider the following unambiguous quantifica-
tion structure in a generalized quantifier format
(hereafter G Q Barwise &amp; Cooper, 1981), where
quantifier outscopes any quantifiers that may oc-
cur in either restriction or body.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.803679">
(3) quantifier(variable, restriction, body)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999081">
Logical forms as notated this way make explicit the
functional dependency between the denotations of
two ordered quantificational NPs. For example, con-
sider (4) (a) (Partee, 1975). (b) shows one way of
representing it in a GQ format.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.956143666666667">
(4) (a) Three Frenchmen visited five Russians.
(b) three(f, frenchnen(f), five(r,
russians (r), visited(f ,r)))
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98605475">
We can always argue, by enriching the notation, that
(4) (b) represents at least four different readings, de-
pending on the particular sense of each involved NP,
i.e., group- vs individual-denoting. In every such
reading, however, the truth of (4) (b) depends upon
finding appropriate individuals (or the group) for f
such that each of those individuals (or the group
itself) gets associated with appropriate individuals
(or a group of individuals) for r via the relation
visited.4 Notice that there is always a functional
dependency of individuals denoted by r upon indi-
viduals denoted by f. We claim that this explicit
functional dependency can be utilized to test availa-
bility of readings.3
First, consider the following sentences without
coordination.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.911109833333333">
(5) (a) Two representatives of three companies
saw most samples.
(b) Every dealer shows most customers at
most three cars.
(c) Most boys think that every man danced
with two women.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.896360238095238">
(a) has three quantifiers, and there are 6 different
ways of ordering them. Hobbs &amp; Shieber (1987)
show that among these, the reading in which two re-
presentatives outscopes most samples which in turn
outscopes three companies is not available from the
sentence. They attribute the reason to the logical
structure of English as in (3), as it is considered
unable to afford an unbound variable, a constraint
known as the unbound variable constraint (uvc).6
We should note, however, that there is one reading
pings generated by a scheme similar to Hobbs &amp; Shieber
(1887). We claim that competence grammar makes even
fewer readings available in the first place.
4Without losing generality, therefore, we will consider
only individual-denoting NPs in this paper.
5Singular NPs such as a company are not helpful to
this task since their denotations do not involve multi-
ple individuals which explicitly induce this functional
dependency.
5The reading would be represented as follows, which
has the first occurrence of the variable c left unbound.

among the remaining five that the uvc allows which
in fact does not appear to be available. This is the
one in which three companies outscopes most samp-
les which in turn outscopes two representatives (cf.
Horn (1972), Fodor (1982)).7 This suggests that
the uvc may not be the only principle under which
Hobbs &amp; Shieber&apos;s reading is excluded.8 The other
four readings of (a) are self-evidently available. If
we generalize over available readings, they are only
those that have no quantifiers which intercalate over
NP boundaries.2
(5) (b) has three quantifiers too, but unlike (5)
(a), all the six ways of ordering the quantifiers are
available. (5) (c) has only four available readings,
where most boys does not intercalate every man and
two women.&amp;quot;
Consider now sentences including coordination.

more than two women.
As Geach (1970) pointed out, (a) has only two gram-
matical readings, though it has three quantifiers. In
reading 1, the same saxophonist was admired and
detested at the same time. In reading 2, every girl
admired an arbitrary saxophonist and most boys
also detested an arbitrary saxophonist. In particu-
lar, missing readings include the one in which every
girl admired the same saxophonist and most boys
detested the same but another saxophonist. (6) (b)

To paraphrase this impossible reading, it is true of a
situation under which there were three companies such
that there were four samples for each such company such
that each such sample was seen by two representatives of
that company. Crucially, samples seen by representatives
of different companies were not necessarily the same.
&apos;This should not be taken as denying the reality of the
uvc itself. For example, as one of the referees pointed
out, the uvc is required to explain why, in (a) below,
every professor must outscope a friend so as to bind the
pronoun his.
(a) Most students talked to a friend of every pro-
fessor about his work.
90ne can replace most samples with other complex
NP such as most samples of at least five products to see
this. Certain sentences that apparently escape this ge-
neralization will be discussed in the next section.

<listItem confidence="0.947784">
19To see why they are available, it is enough to see
that (a) and (b) below have two readings each.
(a) John thinks that every man danced with two
women.
(b) Most boys think that Bill danced with two
women.

also has only two grammatical readings. In one,
most boys outscopes every man and a few boys which
together outscope more than two women. In the
other, more than two women outscopes every man
and a few boys, which together outscope most boys.

The obvious reading for (a) is called conjunctive or
cumulative (Partee, 1975; Webber 1979). In this
reading, there are three hunters and five tigers such
that shooting events happened between the two par-
ties. Here, arguments are not presented in succes-
sion to their function, contrary to the present gene-
ralization. Notice, however, that the reading must
have two (or more) referential NPs (Higginbotham,
1987).13 The question is whether our theory should
predict this possibility as well. For a precise notion
of availability, we claim that we must appeal to the
distinction between referential and quantificational
NP-semantics, since almost any referential NP can
have the appearance of taking the matrix scope, wi-
thout affecting the rest of scope phenomena. A re-
lated example is (b), where in one reading a referen-
tial NP a company arguably outscopes most samples
which in turn outscopes every representative (Hobbs
Shieber, 1987). As we have pointed out earlier,
the reading does not generalize to quantified NPs in

the possibility that the two conjuncts can be repre-

This section describes a CCG approach to deriving
scoped logical forms so that they range over only
grammatical readings.
We will not discuss details of how CCG charac-
terizes natural language syntactically, and refer the
interested reader to Steedman (1993). CCGs make
use of a limited set of combinators, type raising (T),
function composition (B), and function substitution
(S), with directionality of combination for syntac-
tic grammaticality. For the examples in this pa-
per, we only need type raising and function composi-

The mapping from syntax to semantics is usually
defined in two different ways. One is to use ele-
mentary categories, such as up or s, in encoding
both syntactic types and logical forms (Jowsey, 1990;
Steedman, 1990; Park, 1992). The other is to asso-
ciate the entire lexical category with a higher-order
expression (Kulick, 1995). In this paper, we take the
former alternative to describe a first-order rendering
of CCG.
Some lexical entries for every are shown below.

The information (s/(s \np))/n encodes the syntac-
tic fact that every is a constituent which, when
a constituent of category n is provided on its
right, returns a constituent of category 8/(8 \np).
q-every (X , S) is a term for scoped logical forms.
We are using different lexical items, for instance
q-every and s-every for every, in order to signify
their semantic differences.14 These lexical entries
are just two instances of a general schema for type-
raised categories of quantifiers shown below, where

ture several related NP-semantics, such as collective NP-

way quantifiers inside S can be placed between the two

In particular, (24) does not have those two readings
in which every dealer intercalates most customers
and three cars. This is exactly predicted by the pre-
sent CCG framework, extending Geach&apos;s observa-
tion regarding (6) (a), since the coordination forces
the two NPs, most customers and three cars, to be
composed first (Dowty, 1988; Steedman 1990; Park
1992). (25) through (27) show one such derivation,
which results in readings where three cars outscopes
most customers but every dealer must take either
wide or narrow scope with respect to both most cu-
stomers and three cars.

Figure 5 shows the relevant derivation for the frag-
ment investigate two dialects of discussed at end of
previous section. It is a conjoinable constituent, but
since there is no way of using type-raised category
for two for a successful derivation, two dialects can
not outscope any other NPs, such as subject NP or
the modifying NP (Steedman, 1992). This correctly
accounts for our intuition that (14) (a) has an ap-
parently intercalating reading and that (14) (b) has
only two readings. However, there is no similar deri-
vation for the fragment of three companies touched,
as shown below.

We have shown that the range of grammatical rea-
dings allowed by sentences with multiple quantified
NPs can be characterized by abstraction at function-
argument structure constrained by syntactic adja-
cency. This result is in principle available to other
paradigms that invoke operations like QR at LF or
type-lifting, which are essentially equivalent to ab-
straction. The advantage of CCG&apos;s very free notion

of surface structure is that it ties abstraction or the
equivalent as closely as possible to derivation. Ap-
parent counterexamples to the generalization can be
explained by the well-known distinction between re-
ferential and quantificational NP-semantics. An im-
plementation of the theory for an English fragment
has been written in Prolog, simulating the 2nd order
properties.
There is a question of how the non-standard sur-
face structures of CCG are compatible with well-
known conditions on binding and control (including
crossover). These conditions are typically stated on
standard syntactic dominance relations, but these
relations are no longer uniquely derivable once CCG
allows non-standard surface structures. We can
show, however, that by making use of the obliquen-
ess hierarchy (cf. Jackendoff (1972) and much sub-
sequent work) at the level of LF, rather than sur-
face structure, it is possible to state such conditions
(Steedman, 1993).

This paper examines English constructions that allow multiple occurrences of quantified NPs: NP modifications, transitive or ditransitive verbs, that complements, and coordinate structures. Based on a critical analysis of readings that are available from these data, the claim is that scope phenomena can be characterized by a combination of syntactic surface adjacency and semantic function-argument relationship. This characterization will draw upon the old distinction between referential and quantificational NP-semantics (Fodor &amp; Sag, 1982). We choose to use Combinatory Categorial Grammar to show how surface adjacency affects semantic functionargument relationship, since CCG has the flexibility of composing almost any pair of adjacent constituents with a precise notion of syntactic grammaticality (Steedman, 1990; 1993).1 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we discuss in ยง2 how traditional techniques address availability of readings and note some residual problems. Then we give a brief analysis of available readings (ยง3), a generalization of the analysis (ยง4), and finally describe a computational implementation </context>

For example, wide scope reading of a woman in (a) below is accounted for by quantifying-in (with a meaning postulate), patterned after one for (b). (2) (a) Every man loves a woman. (b) Every man seeks a white unicorn. His suggestion is adopted with various subsequent revisions cited earlier. Since any NP, referential or quantificational, requires quantifying-in to outscope another, quantifying-in consequently confounds referential and quantificational NP-semantics. This causes a problem when there is a distributional difference between referential NPs and non-referential NPs, as Fodor &amp; Sag (1982) have argued, a view which has been followed by the approaches to dynamic interpretation of indefinite NPs cited earlier. It seems hard to reconcile quantifying-in with these observations. 3 Availability of Readings This section proposes a way of sharpening our intuition on available readings and re-examines traditional linguistic judgments on grammatical readings.

But first we must consider some apparent counterexamples to the generalization. (13) (a) Three hunters shot at five tigers. (b) Every representative of a company saw most samples. The obvious reading for (a) is called conjunctive or cumulative (Partee, 1975; Webber 1979). In this reading, there are three hunters and five tigers such that shooting events happened between the two parties. Here, arguments are not presented in succession to their function, contrary to the present generalization. Notice, however, that the reading must have two (or more) referential NPs (Higginbotham, 1987).13 The question is whether our theory should predict this possibility as well. For a precise notion of availability, we claim that we must appeal to the distinction between referential and quantificational NP-semantics, since almost any referential NP can have the appearance of taking the matrix scope, without affecting the rest of scope phenomena. A related example is (b), where in one reading a referential NP a company arguably outscopes most samples which in turn outscopes every representative (Hobbs Shieber, 1987).

Hobbs &amp; Shieber (1987) show that among these, the reading in which two representatives outscopes most samples which in turn outscopes three companies is not available from the sentence.

In the other, more than two women outscopes every man and a few boys, which together outscope most boys. 4 An Account of Availability This section proposes a generalization at the level of semantics for the phenomena described earlier and considers its apparent counterexamples. Consider a language .0 for natural language semantics that explicitly represents function-argument relationships (Jackendoff, 1972). Suppose that in the semantic form of a quantified NP is a syntactic argument of the semantic form of a verb or a preposition.

An implementation of the theory for an English fragment has been written in Prolog, simulating the 2nd order properties. There is a question of how the non-standard surface structures of CCG are compatible with wellknown conditions on binding and control (including crossover). These conditions are typically stated on standard syntactic dominance relations, but these relations are no longer uniquely derivable once CCG allows non-standard surface structures. We can show, however, that by making use of the obliqueness hierarchy (cf. Jackendoff (1972) and much subsequent work) at the level of LF, rather than surface structure, it is possible to state such conditions (Steedman, 1993).

While there are undoubted differences in degree of availability among readings dependent upon semantics or discourse preference (Bunt, 1985; Moran, 1988), we will focus on all-or-none structural possibilities afforded by competence grammar.3 2In this simplistic notation, we gloss over tense analysis, among others. &apos;Moran&apos;s preference-based algorithm treats certain readings as &amp;quot;highly unpreferred,&amp;quot; effectively making them structurally unavailable, from those possible scoConsider the following unambiguous quantification structure in a generalized quantifier format (hereafter G Q Barwise &amp; Cooper, 1981), where quantifier outscopes any quantifiers that may occur in either restriction or body.

We will not discuss details of how CCG characterizes natural language syntactically, and refer the interested reader to Steedman (1993). CCGs make use of a limited set of combinators, type raising (T), function composition (B), and function substitution (S), with directionality of combination for syntactic grammaticality. For the examples in this paper, we only need type raising and function composition, along with function application. The following shows rules of derivation that we use. Each rule is associated with a label, such as &gt; or &lt;B etc, shown at the end.

There is a question of how the non-standard surface structures of CCG are compatible with wellknown conditions on binding and control (including crossover). These conditions are typically stated on standard syntactic dominance relations, but these relations are no longer uniquely derivable once CCG allows non-standard surface structures. We can show, however, that by making use of the obliqueness hierarchy (cf. Jackendoff (1972) and much subsequent work) at the level of LF, rather than surface structure, it is possible to state such conditions (Steedman, 1993).

There are also approaches that put more emphasis on utilizing contextual information in restricting the generation of semantic forms by choosing a scope-neutral representation augmented with ordering constraints to capture linguistic judgments (Webber, 1979; Kamp, 1981; Heim, 1983; Poesio, 1991; Reyle, 1993). And there are computational approaches that screen unavailable and/or redundant semantic forms (Hobbs &amp; Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988; Vestre, 1991). This paper will show that these approaches allow unavailable readings, and thereby miss an important generalization concerning the readings that actually are available. This paper examines English constructions that allow multiple occurrences of quantified NPs: NP modifications, transitive or ditransitive verbs, that complements, and coordinate structures. Based on a critical analysis of readings that are available from these data, the claim is that scope phenomena can be characterized by a combination of syntactic surface adjacency and semantic function-argument relationship.

But first we must consider some apparent counterexamples to the generalization. (13) (a) Three hunters shot at five tigers. (b) Every representative of a company saw most samples. The obvious reading for (a) is called conjunctive or cumulative (Partee, 1975; Webber 1979). In this reading, there are three hunters and five tigers such that shooting events happened between the two parties. Here, arguments are not presented in succession to their function, contrary to the present generalization. Notice, however, that the reading must have two (or more) referential NPs (Higginbotham, 1987).13 The question is whether our theory should predict this possibility as well. For a precise notion of availability, we claim that we must appeal to the distinction between referential and quantificational NP-semantics, since almost any referential NP can have the appearance of </context>
