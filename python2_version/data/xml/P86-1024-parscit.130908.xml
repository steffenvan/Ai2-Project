ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999028238095238">
The following proposal is for a Japanese sentence
analysis method to be used in a Japanese book reading
machine. This method is designed to allow for several
candidates in case of ambiguous characters. Each
sentence is analyzed to compose a data structure by
defining the relationship between words and phrases.
This structure ( named network structure ) involves all
possible combinations of syntactically collect phrases.
After network structure has been completed, heuristic
rules are applied in order to determine the most probable
way to arrange the phrases and thus organize the best
sentence. All information about each sentence - the
pronunciation of each word with its accent and the
structure of phrases - will be used during speech
synthesis. Experiment results reveal: 99.1% of all
characters were given their correct pronunciation. Using
several recognized character candidates is more efficient
than only using first ranked characters as the input for
sentence analysis. Also this facility increases the
efficiency of the book reading machine in that it enables
the user to select other ways to organize sentences.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984827586207">
English text-to-speech conversion technology has
substantially progressed through massive research ( e.g.,
Allen 1973, 1976, 1986; Klatt 1982, 1986 ). A book
reading machine for the blind is a typical use for text-to-
speech technology in the welfare field ( Allen 1973 ).
According to the Kurzweil Reading Machine Update
( 1985 ), the Machine is in use by thousands of people in
over 500 locations worldwide.
In the case of Japanese, however, due to the
complexities of the language, Japanese text-to-speech
conversion technology hasn&apos;t progressed as fast as that of
English. Recently a Japanese text-to-speech synthesizer
has been introduced ( Kabeya et al. 1985 ). However, this
synthesizer accepts only Japanese character code strings
and doesn&apos;t include the character recognition facility.
Since 1982, the authors have been engaged in the
research and development of a Japanese sentence analysis
method to be used in a book reading machine for the
blind. The first version of the Japanese book reading
machine, which is aimed to examine algorithms and its
performance, has developed in 1984 ( Tsuji and Asai 1985;
Tsukumo and Asai 1985; Fukushima et al. 1985; Mitome
and Fushikida 1985, 1986 ). Figure 1 shows the book
reading process of the machine. A pocket-size book is first
scanned, then each character on the page is detected and
recognized. Sentence analysis ( parsing ) is accomplished
by using character recognition result. Finally, synthesized
speech is generated. The speech can be recorded for
future use. The pages will turn automatically.

The Japanese sentence analysis method that the
authors have developed has two functions: One, to choose
an appropriate character among several input character
candidates when the character recognition result is
ambiguous. Two, to convert the written character strings
into phonetic symbols. The written character strings are
made up Kanji ( Chinese ) characters and kana ( Japanese
consonant-vowel combination ) characters. These
phonetic symbols depict both the pronunciation and
accent of each word. The structure of the phrases is also
obtained in order to determine the pause positions and
intonation.
After briefly describing the difficulty of Japanese
sentence analysis technology compared to that of English,
this paper will outline the Japanese sentence analysis
method, as well as experimental results.
2. Comparison of Japanese and English as Input
for a Book Reading Machine
In this section, the difficulty of Japanese sentence
analysis is described by comparing with that of English.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9974855">
2.1 Conversion from Written Characters to
Phonetic Symbols
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999706310344827">
In English, text-to-speech conversion can be achieved
by applying general rules. For exceptional words which
are outside the rules, an exceptional word dictionary is
used. Accentuation can be also achieved by rules and an
exceptional dictionary.
Roughly speaking, Japanese text-to-speech conversion
is similar to that of English. However, in case of
Japanese, more diligent analysis is required. Japanese
sentences are written by using Kanji characters and kana
characters. Thousands of kinds of Kanji characters are
generally used in Japanese sentences. And, most of the
Kanji characters have several readings ( Figure 2 (a) ).
On the other hand, the number of kana characters is less
than one hundred. Each kana character corresponds to
certain monosyllable. Therefore, in the conversion of
kana characters, kana-to-phoneme conversion rules seem
to be successfully applied. However, in two cases, kana
characters and are used as Kaku-Joshi, Japanese
preposition which follows a noun to form a noun phrase,
then the pronunciation changes ( Figure 2 (b) ).
Subsequently the reading of numerical words also changes
( Figure 2 (c) ).
As described above, the pronunciation of each
character in Japanese sentences is determined by a
neighbor character which combines to form a word.
There are too many exceptions in Japanese to create
general rules. Therefore, a large size word dictionary
which covers all commonly used words is generally used to
analyze Japanese sentences.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998945">
2.2 Required Sentence Analysis Level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998809">
In English sentences, the boundaries between words
are indicated by spaces and punctuation marks. This is
quite helpful in detecting phrase structure, which is used
to determinate pause positions and intonation.
On the contrary, Japanese sentences only have
punctuation marks. They don&apos;t have any spaces which
indicate word boundaries. Therefore, more precise
analysis is required in order to detect word boundaries at
first. The structure of the sentence will be analyzed after
the word detection.

2.3 Character Recognition Accuracy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968416666667">
English sentences consist of twenty-six alphabet
characters and other characters, such as numbers and
punctuations. Because of the fewer number of the English
alphabet characters, characters can be recognized
accurately.
Japanese sentences consist of thousands of Kanji
characters, more than one hundred different kana
characters ( two kana character sets - Hiragana and
Katakana - are used in Japanese sentences ) and
alphanumeric characters. Because of the variety of
characters, even when using a well-established character
recognition method, the result is sometimes ambiguous.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.459206">
3. Characteristics of Sentence Analysis Method
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985311862068966">
The Japanese sentence analysis method has the
following characteristics.
1. The mixed Kanji-kana strings are analyzed both
through word extraction and syntactical
examination. An internal data structure ( named
network structure in this paper ), which defines the
relationship of all possible words and phrases, is
composed through word extraction and syntactical
examination. After network structure has been
completed, heuristic rules are applied in order to
determine the most probable way to arrange the
phrases and thus organize a sentence.
2. When an obtained character recognition result is
ambiguous, several candidates per character are
accepted. Unsuitable character candidates are
eliminated through sentence analysis.
3. Each punctuation mark is used as a delimiter.
Sentence analysis of Japanese reads back to front
between punctuation marks. For example, the
analysis starts from the position of the first
punctuation mark and works to the beginning of the
sentence. Thus, word dictionaries and their indexes
have been organized so they can be used through
this sequence.
4. The sentence analysis method is required for short
computing time to analyze unrestricted Japanese
text. Therefore, it has been designed not to analyze
deep sentence structure, such as semantic or
pragmatic correlates.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.969645125">
5. By the user&apos;s request, the book reading machine can
read the same sentence again and again. If the user
wants to change the way of reading ( e.g. in the case
that there are homographs ), the machine can also
creat other ways of reading. In order to achieve this
goal, several pages of sentence analysis result is kept
while the machine is in use.
4. Outline of Sentence Analysis System
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999728166666667">
As shown in Figure 3, the Japanese sentence analysis
system consists of two subsystems and word dictionaries.
Two subsystems are named &amp;quot;network structure
composition subsystem&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;speech information
organization subsystem-, respectively. These subsystems
work asynchronously.

4.1 Network Structure Composition Subsystem
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988362742857143">
As the input, the network structure composition
subsystem receives character recognition results. When
the character recognition result is ambiguous, several
character candidates appear. During the character
recognition, the probability of each character candidate is
also obtained. Figure 4 is an example of character
recognition result. Figure 4 describes: The first character
of the sentence as having three character candidates. The
fifth and seventh characters as having two candidates.
Except the fifth character, all of the first ranking
character candidates are correct. However, the fifth
character proves an exception with the second ranking
character candidate as the desired character.
With the recognized result, the network structure
composition subsystem is activated. Figure 5 describes
how the recognition result ( shown in Figure 4 ) is
analyzed.
Through the detection of punctuation marks in the
input sentence ( recognition result ), the subsystem
determines the region to be analyzed. After one region
has been analyzed, the next punctuation mark which
determines the next region is detected. In case of Figure
5, for example, whole data will be analyzed at once,
because the first punctuation mark is located at the end of
the sentence.
Characters in the region are analyzed from the
detected punctuation to the beginning of the sentence.
The analysis is accomplished by both word extraction ind
syntactical examination. Words in dictionaries are
extracted by using character strings which are obtained
by combining character candidates. The type of the
characters ( kana, Kanji etc. ) determines which index for
the dictionaries will be used.

After extracting the words, phrases are composed by
combining the words. Using syntactical rules ( i.e.
conjugation rules ), only syntactically correct phrases are
composed.
Finally, by using these phrases, network structure is
composed. Network structure obtained through the
analysis described in Figure 5 is shown in Figure 6. This
structure involves the following information.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997213142857143">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.757538272727273">
Some features of Japanese language are utilized in the
network structure composition subsystem. Some examples
of them are as follow.
1. In general, a Japanese phrase consists of both an
independent word and dependent words. The prefix
word and/or the suffix word are sometimes
adjoined. The number of dependent words is not so
many as compared with independent words. It
seems to be efficient to analyze dependent words
first. Thus, the analysis is accomplished from the
end of the region to the beginning.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987475">
2. Independent words mostly include non-kana
characters, alternately, dependent words are written
in kana characters. Therefore, higher priority is
given both to independent words which include a
non-kana characters and to dependent words which
consist of only kana characters.
3. The number of Kanji characters is far greater than
that of kana characters. Therefore, it seems efficient
to use a Kanji character as the search key to scan
the dictionary indexes. These indexes are designed
so that the search key must be a non-kana character
in cases where there is one or more non-kana
character.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.959848">
4.2 Speech Information Organization Subsystem
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999861785714286">
With the user&apos;s request for speech synthesis, the
speech information organization subsystem is activated.
This subsystem determines the best sentence ( a
combination of phrases ) by examining the phrases in
network structure. After organizing the sentence, the
information for speech synthesis is then organized. The
pronunciation and accent of each word are determined by
using the dictionaries. The structure of the sentence is
obtained by analyzing the relationship between phrases.
In case of numerical words, such as 1,234.56, a special
procedure is activated to generate the reading. In case the
user requests other ways of reading the sentence, the
subsystem chooses other ph-rases in network structure,
thus organizing the speech synthesis information.

In order to determine the most probable phrase
combination in network structure, heuristic rules are
applied. The rules have been obtained mainly by
experiments. Some of them are as follow.
Number of Phrases in a Sentence
The sentence which contains the least number of
phrases will be given the highest priority.
2, Probabilities of Characters
The phrase which contains more probable
character candidates will be given higher priority.
This probability is obtained as the result of
character recognition.
I31 Written Format of Words
Independent words written in kana characters
will be given lower priority.
Independent words written in one character
will be also given lower priority.
141 Syntactical Combination Appearance Frequency
The frequently used syntactical combination
will be given higher priority.

151 Selected Phrases
The phrase which once has been selected by
a user will be given higher priority.

phrases is determined by applying the heuristic rule [1].

6. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910857142857">
A sentence analysis method used in a Japanese book
reading machine has been described. Input sentences,
where each character is allowed to have other candidates,
are analyzed by using several word dictionaries, as well as
employing syntactical examinations. After generating
network structure, heuristic rules are applied in order to
determine the most desirable sentence used for speech
information generation. The results of experiments
reveal: 99.1% of all characters used in two whole books
have been correctly converted to their pronunciation.
Even when the character recognition result is ambiguous,
correct characters can often be chosen by the sentence
analysis method. By manual selection, most incorrect
characters can be corrected.
Currently, the authors are improving the sentence
analysis method including the heuristic rules and the
contents of dictionaries through book reading experiments
and data examinations. This work is, needless to say,
aimed in offering better quality speech to the blind users
in a short computing time. Authors are expecting that
their efforts will contribute to the welfare field.

<abstract confidence="0.999770727272727">The following proposal is for a Japanese sentence analysis method to be used in a Japanese book reading machine. This method is designed to allow for several candidates in case of ambiguous characters. Each sentence is analyzed to compose a data structure by defining the relationship between words and phrases. structure ( named structure ) all possible combinations of syntactically collect phrases. has been completed, heuristic rules are applied in order to determine the most probable way to arrange the phrases and thus organize the best sentence. All information about each sentence the pronunciation of each word with its accent and the structure of phrases will be used during speech synthesis. Experiment results reveal: 99.1% of all characters were given their correct pronunciation. Using several recognized character candidates is more efficient only using first ranked characters input for sentence analysis. Also this facility increases the efficiency of the book reading machine in that it enables the user to select other ways to organize sentences.</abstract>

Introduction English text-to-speech conversion technology has substantially progressed through massive research ( e.g., Allen 1973, 1976, 1986; Klatt 1982, 1986 ). A book reading machine for the blind is a typical use for text-tospeech technology in the welfare field ( Allen 1973 ). According to the Kurzweil Reading Machine Update ( 1985 ), the Machine is in use by thousands of people in over 500 locations worldwide. In the case of Japanese, however, due to the complexities of the language, Japanese text-to-speech conversion technology hasn&apos;t progressed as fast as that of English. Recently a Japanese text-to-speech synthesizer has been introduced ( Kabeya et al. 1985 ). However, this synthesizer accepts only Japanese cha</context>
