An approach to recognizing sentiment
polarity in Chinese reviews based on
topic sentiment sentences is presented.
Considering the features of Chinese re-
views, we firstly identify the topic of a
review using an n-gram matching ap-
proach. To extract candidate topic senti-
ment sentences, we compute the seman-
tic similarity between a given sentence
and the ascertained topic and meanwhile
determine whether the sentence is sub-
jective. A certain number of these sen-
tences are then selected as representa-
tives according to their semantic simi-
larity value with relation to the topic.
The average value of the representative
topic sentiment sentences is calculated
and taken as the sentiment polarity of a
review. Experiment results show that the
proposed method is feasible and can
achieve relatively high precision.

Sentiment analysis, also known as “opinion min-
ing”, is the problem of analyzing the sentiment,
opinion or any other subjectivity of written texts.
With its potential applications to opinion search
engine, public opinion analysis, product promo-
tion, etc., sentiment analysis has been receiving
increasing interest in recent years.
What sentiment analysis processes are texts
with subjectivity which mainly describe the
writers’ (or on behalf of a group or an organiza-
tion) private thoughts, attitudes or opinions on
phenomena, persons, affairs and so on. Although
various kinds of writings such as narration and
exposition are possible to contain subjectivity,
argumentation is the focus of sentiment analysis
on which researchers put much strength at
present. As a kind of argumentation and a typi-
cal and common subjective text, a review com-
ments on some specific phenomenon, person or
affair. Reviews, especially news reviews, have a
certain degree of influence on public opinion in
virtue of mass media. Domain-specific reviews
like automobile, hotel, movie reviews have po-
tential commercial value respectively. Therefore,
recognizing sentiment polarity (SP thereafter) in
reviews becomes necessary and practical.
Language is a hierarchical symbol system,
which allows sentiment analysis to be conducted
on different language levels. In general, most
current studies concerning sentiment analysis are
about determining the SP of words, phrases or
sentences. Only a fraction of them addressed
discourse level sentiment analysis. This paper,
aiming at recognizing the overall SP of Chinese
reviews, proposes a topic-sentiment-sentence
based approach to carry out a discourse level
sentiment analysis.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. Related works are presented in section 2.
Section 3 is problem analysis and method de-
scription. Section 4 describes topic identification
and topic sentiment sentence extraction. Section
5 is about recognizing SP in Chinese reviews
using the extracted topic sentiment sentences.
Section 6 is the experiment results and section 7
is the conclusion.

The SP determination can be generally
conducted on three language levels: the word
level, the sentence level and the discourse level.
The two main popular approaches, especially in
real-world applications, have been based on
machine learning techniques and based on
semantic analysis techniques. Research aiming
at recognizing the overall SP of discourse is
represented by Turney (2002), Pang et al. (2002)
and Yi et al. (2003). Turney proposed an
unsupervised learning algorithm to classify the
sentiment orientation of reviews. The mutual
information difference between the given word
or phrase and the words “poor” and “excellent”
was calculated respectively to measure its
semantic orientation; then the average semantic
orientation of all the words in a given text was
regarded as the overall semantic orientation.
Pang et al. employed such classification models
as Naïve Bayesian model, Maximum Entropy
model and Support Vector Machine model to
classify the semantic orientation of movie
reviews, in which the features of models selected
included unigrams, bigrams, parts of speech,
word position, feature frequency and feature
presence. Yi et al. firstly analyzed the
grammatical structure of sentences using NLP
techniques. The semantic orientation of a
sentence then is determined by referring to a
sentiment lexicon and a sentiment pattern
database. They applied the approach to
classifying the overall SP of document.
Other related works are concerning the senti-
ment analysis of sentences and words which un-
derlie recognizing the overall SP of a whole text.
Wiebe et al. (2000, 2004) proved that the subjec-
tivity of a sentence could be judged according to
the adjectives in it. Kim &amp; Hovy (2004) and
Weibe &amp; Riloff (2005) explored the classifica-
tion of subjective and objective sentences. Yu et
al. (2003) put forward an approach to extract
opinionated sentences in order to serve an auto-
matic question answering system. The extracted
sentences were classified and the SP of each was
determined. Hu &amp; Liu (2004) took advantage of
WordNet to obtain sentiment words and their
orientations. The polarity of a sentence thus is
judged according to the dominant semantic
orientation of sentiment words.
For Chinese, Wang et al. (2005) proposed a
hybrid approach to recognize the semantic orien-
tations of sentences in reviews based on heuris-
tic rules and Bayesian classification technique.
Wang et al. (2007) applied a Multi-redundant-
labeled CRFs method on sentence sentiment
analysis. Experiments showed it solved ordinal
regression problems effectively and obtained
global optimal result over multiple cascaded
subtasks. Meng et al. (2008) designed a recogni-
tion system of text valence based on key word
template in which they proposed template
matching arithmetic and text valence value
arithmetic for the calculation of the valence of
Chinese texts. Zheng et al. (2009) conducted a
research on sentiment analysis to Chinese travel-
er reviews by SVM algorithm.

3.1 Discourse Structure of Chinese Texts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999883">
The overall SP of a Chinese text is the sum of
the SP of all its component parts. However, the
importance of each component part in a given
text varies. This is because no matter which
writing style a text belongs to, it has a particular
discourse structure which determines the impor-
tance of the component parts.
Discourse structure is the organization and
constitution law of language units (greater than
sentence) within a discourse. It formally indi-
cates the hierarchy of discourse contents, seman-
tically guarantees the integrity of discourse con-
tents and logically reflects the coherence of dis-
course contents. In a word, discourse structure is
the unity of discourse form, discourse meaning
and discourse logic. A discourse consists of sev-
eral semantic parts. The central meaning of a
discourse is the aggregation of the central mean-
ing of its semantic parts in a certain logic way. A
semantic part is the set of paragraphs. It may be
composed of as small as only a paragraph or as
large as even a whole chapter. The basis for par-
titioning semantic parts depends on the writing
styles, i.e., narration, description, argumentation
and exposition. For argumentation, a typical ar-
gumentation may be divided into 4 parts as in-
troduction, viewpoint presentation, demonstra-
tion and conclusion. Recognizing semantic parts
has great significance in understanding the cen-
tral idea of a text.

3.2 Features of Chinese Reviews
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912102564102">
Chinese reviews are a kind of argumentation.
According to what is reviewed, they can be ca-
tegorized into finance reviews (e.g., stock re-
view), literature reviews (e.g., book review),
product reviews (e.g., automobile review), cur-
rent affairs reviews (e.g., news review), etc.
Generally speaking, Chinese reviews bear the
following features.
Firstly, the topic of a Chinese review is expli-
cit. A Chinese review always comments on some
specific phenomenon, person or affair. The ob-
ject it deals with is very explicit.
Secondly, a Chinese review has generally on-
ly one topic. Thus, in a Chinese review, the re-
viewer always explicitly expresses his/her opi-
nion towards the topic. The sentiment of the dis-
cussed topic is rather explicit. Some Chinese
reviews may discuss subtopics and correspond-
ing opinions on each subtopic may be shown.
But it will not change or influence the reviewer’s
basic sentiment on the topic.
Thirdly, the topic of a Chinese review is
closely related to its title. Chinese Reviews often
use concise expressions in titles to show clearly
the topics or the themes. Therefore, the topic of
a review can generally be found in its title.
Fourthly, Chinese reviews have fixed expres-
sion patterns. A typical Chinese review consists
of 4 semantic parts as is mentioned above. The
reviewer’s sentiment expressions towards the
topic generally appears in the “viewpoint presen-
tation” and “conclusion” part.
To prove the correctness of our knowledge of
Chinese reviews, we conducted a survey on 560
Chinese reviews which were collected from
newspapers and the Internet. The manually ex-
amined results, which are showed as follows,
verify the above mentioned 4 features of Chi-
nese reviews.

3.3 Topic Sentiment Sentence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999196875">
According to the above analysis, the SP of a
Chinese review is manifested by a certain ex-
pression pattern through several semantic parts,
and its overall SP is generally expressed in the
“viewpoint presentation” and “conclusion” part.
Thus a straightforward idea to obtain the SP of a
Chinese review is to: (1) partition the review
into several semantic parts; (2) distinguish the
viewpoint presentation part and the conclusion
part; (3) analyze only the sentiment of the view-
point presentation part and the conclusion part
and take the result as the overall SP of the re-
view. Intuitively, this seemingly simple method
can achieve very good result.
However, to perform an automatic discourse
structure analysis itself is actually a hard task
and will lose precision during the processing; to
distinguish different semantic parts by means of
language cues without a discourse structure
analysis can only solve some instead of all prob-
lems. Therefore, we introduce the concept of
topic sentiment sentence.
A topic sentiment sentence is defined as a sen-
tence bearing both the topic concept and senti-
ment towards that topic. The topic sentiment
sentences in a Chinese review are the intersec-
tion of the topic sentences and sentiment sen-
tences in it. Topic sentiment sentences are repre-
sentative for sentiment analysis because, firstly,
they are homogeneous in topic. And more im-
portantly, the sentiment bearing in these sen-
tences refer to the same topic. This makes sen-
timent in each sentence computable. Earlier
works like Turney (2002) or Pang et al (2002)
don’t take into account the topic and the senti-
ment relating to that topic together as a whole,
thus makes the result less reliable in that the sen-
timent words and phrases processed are not ho-
mogeneous in topic. Secondly, the degree of se-
mantic similarity between topic sentiment sen-
tences and the topic of the review reflects a po-
tential relatedness between the topic sentiment
sentences and their corresponding semantic parts.
The more a topic sentiment sentence is similar in
meaning to the topic, the more likely it appears
in the viewpoint presentation part or conclusion
part. This is just the reason we avoid an analysis
of discourse structure of a review. We also try to
avoid an automatic partition of semantic parts of
a review since the topic sentiment sentences
themselves potentially point out the correspond-
ing semantic parts they belong to. Thirdly, the
distribution of the topic sentiment sentences,
including density and extensity, reflects more or
less the writer’s intensity of attitude toward what
is being discussed and can help with detailed
sentiment analysis.
To summarize, with topic sentiment sentences,
we can compute the SP of a Chinese review in a
more simple and effective way without an auto-
matic discourse structure analysis. Moreover, we
can obtain a “shallow” structure since topic sen-
timent sentences potentially reflect the discourse
structure of Chinese reviews.

3.4 Method

<bodyText confidence="0.999856">
We thus propose a new method to recognize the
sentiment polarity of Chinese reviews using top-
ic sentiment sentences. It is described as follows.
(1) Identify the topic of a review using an n-
gram matching approach. (2) Extract candidate
topic sentiment sentences, compute the semantic
similarity between a given sentence and the as-
certained topic and meanwhile determine wheth-
er the sentence is subjective. (3) A certain num-
ber of these sentences are selected as representa-
tives according to their semantic similarity value
with relation to the topic. The average value of
the representative topic sentiment sentences is
calculated and taken as the sentiment polarity of
a review.
Experiment results show that the proposed
method is feasible and can achieve relatively
high precision.

4.1 Topic Identification of Chinese Reviews
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960066666667">
The topic of a Chinese review is presented as a
set of strings T={Wn1, Wn2, ..., Wni}, in which
Wni refers to a word or several continuous words
and n indicates the number of words in a Wni.
The evaluation of whether any candidate Wni
belongs to T depends on its position and fre-
quency. Wni’s position reflects its distribution
degree D(Wni): the more extensive Wni distri-
butes in a review, the more likely it relates to the
topic. Wni’s frequency reflects its importance
degree I(Wni): the more times Wni appears in a
review, the more likely it relates to the topic.
Thus the degree of Wni belongs to T is defined
as membership degree C(Wni) and is measured
by the formula:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.994591">
C(Wni)= Į· D(Wni) +ȕ· I(Wni) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998979555555556">
In (1), D(Wni) is determined by the number of
paragraphs in which D(Wni) appears and the
total number of paragraphs of a text, I(Wni) is
the binary logarithm of the frequency of Wni in a
text, Į and ȕ are the weighted coefficients to ad-
just the weights of D(Wni) and I(Wni).
In order to quickly obtain T, an n-gram
matching based approach is applied according to
the following algorithm.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9258588">
(1) Strings separated by punctuations in the
title and the main text are segmented and then
stored respectively in queue Tq and Bq.
(2) For n=1 to m (1İmİthe maximum
length of Tq), take out a Wni from Tq successive-
ly and search it in Bq. If there is a Wni in Bq,
then insert it into the index table G={Wni, posi-
tion, frequency}. When n=1, which means there
is only one word in Wni, Wni should be a con-
tent word.
(3) Calculate the value of C(Wni) for every
Wni and add Wni to T if its C(Wni) is greater
than the threshold Lc. In this paper, we choose
Į=0.25, ȕ=1, and Lc=0.8 according to our expe-

4.2 The Extraction of Topic Sentiment Sen-
tences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996450318181819">
Topic sentiment sentences are essential in the
analysis of the SP of reviews. Sentiment analysis
based on topic sentiment sentences excludes un-
related sentiment and makes “homogeneous”
sentiment computable. Topic sentiment sen-
tences are extracted by 2 steps.
(1) Extract topic sentences from a review.
Given a definite T, to extract topic sentences is
actually the computing of semantic similarity of
candidate sentences and the topic T. Factors that
influence the similarity degree are the amount of
identical words and strings, the length of iden-
tical words and strings, the position of a candi-
date sentence, semantic similarity of non-
identical words.
The amount of identical words and strings.
The more identical words or strings a candidate
sentence has with T, the more likely they are
similar in topic.
The length of identical words and strings.
The longer an identical string (counted by word)
shared by a candidate sentence and T, the more
likely they are similar in topic.
The position of a candidate sentence. We
hold that sentences in a paragraph are not in the
same importance. As is the general common
knowledge, the beginning and ending sentence
in a paragraph are often more important than
other sentences and thus receive more weights.
We use HowNet, a Chinese ontology, to com-
pute the semantic similarity and assign each
candidate sentence a value of similarity. If the
similarity value of a sentence is greater than the
threshold Ls, it is taken as a topic sentence.
(2) Extract sentiment sentences from topic
sentences. We use a precompiled sentiment lex-
icon to roughly judge whether a sentence ex-
presses sentiment or not.
Through the above procedures, the topic sen-
timent sentences in a Chinese review, each with
a value indicating the distance in similarity with
the topic, are extracted and arranged into order
by value. We call them the set of candidate topic
sentiment sentences.

5 Recognizing the Sentiment Polarity
Based on Topic Sentiment Sentences
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999806541666667">
Based on section 3.3, in Chinese reviews, the
higher similarity degree a topic sentiment sen-
tence gets, the more likely it is a key sentence
expressing the writers’ basic sentiment orienta-
tion. But meanwhile, to avoid excessively rely-
ing on too few candidate topic sentiment sen-
tences, more sentences are required to be ana-
lyzed to assure precision. Therefore, the number
of sentences selected from the set of candidate
topic sentiment sentences for final sentiment
analysis is quite a question worth careful consid-
eration.
Different Chinese reviews have different
numbers of topic sentiment sentences. How
many topic sentiment sentences a review has is
determined by various factors. We find out, after
an investigation of 560 Chinese reviews, that
generally a Chinese review has not more than 7
topic sentiment sentences and the average num-
ber of that is about 4. Besides, long reviews tend
to have rather more topic sentiment sentence.
Thus we define that for any review the number
of topic sentiment sentences which are needed to
be analyzed as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.543965">
N(tss) 4Ȗ (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999398">
y in the above formula is an adjustable para-
meter which is determined by the ratio of the
length of the analyzing review and the average
length of a set of reference reviews.
N(tss) topic sentiment sentences with most
weights are drawn from the set of candidate top-
ic sentiment sentences and then are computed by
a sentence-level sentiment analyzer. The average
score of them is taken as O(r), i.e. the overall SP
of a review.

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935666666666">
We use a semantic approach in the sentence-
level sentiment analyzer. For each sentence, a
Chinese dependency parser is used to distinguish
the dependency relations between language units,
especially the probable relations between the
topic words and the sentiment expressions, and
the relations between the sentiment expressions
and their modifiers. Making use of the syntactic
information, the sentiment of a sentence is de-
termined mainly by the sentiment expressions in
it according to a precompiled sentiment lexicon.
Meanwhile, the following factors are considered.
Negatives. Negatives inverse the sentiment of
a sentence.
Connectors. Some connectors strengthen the
original sentiment while others inverse the origi-
nal sentiment.
Intensifiers. Intensifiers make the original
sentiment more forcefully.
Discourse makers. In linguistics, a discourse
marker is a word or phrase that is relatively syn-
tax-independent and does not change the mean-
ing of the sentence. However, discourse marker
itself has certain semantic orientation: some of
them are positive, some are negative and others
are neutral. Thus discourse marker help recog-
nize the SP in a sentence.
Punctuations. We pay special attention to
question mark and exclamatory mark, especially
when there is a negative in a question sentence.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998875">
We have presented a topic sentiment sentence-
based approach to explore the overall sentiment
polarity of Chinese reviews. Considering the
features of Chinese reviews, we identify the top-
ic of a review using an n-gram approach. To ex-
tract topic sentiment sentences, we compute the
semantic similarity of a candidate sentence and
the ascertained topic and meanwhile determine
whether the sentence is subjective. A certain
number of these sentences are selected as repre-
sentatives according to their semantic similarity
value with relation to the topic. The average val-
ue of the representative topic sentiment sen-
tences is calculated and taken as the sentiment
polarity of a review.
Error analysis indicates that to enhance the
identification of topic, to build up a better sen-
tence-level sentiment analyzer and to compile a
better sentiment lexicon will help improve the
final result.

<abstract confidence="0.999482181818182">An approach to recognizing sentiment polarity in Chinese reviews based on topic sentiment sentences is presented. Considering the features of Chinese reviews, we firstly identify the topic of a review using an n-gram matching approach. To extract candidate topic sentiment sentences, we compute the semantic similarity between a given sentence and the ascertained topic and meanwhile determine whether the sentence is subjective. A certain number of these sentences are then selected as representatives according to their semantic similarity value with relation to the topic. The average value of the representative topic sentiment sentences is calculated and taken as the sentiment polarity of a review. Experiment results show that the proposed method is feasible and can achieve relatively high precision.</abstract>

Section 5 is about recognizing SP in Chinese reviews using the extracted topic sentiment sentences. Section 6 is the experiment results and section 7 is the conclusion. 2 Related Works The SP determination can be generally conducted on three language levels: the word level, the sentence level and the discourse level. The two main popular approaches, especially in real-world applications, have been based on machine learning techniques and based on semantic analysis techniques. Research aiming at recognizing the overall SP of discourse is represented by Turney (2002), Pang et al. (2002) and Yi et al. (2003). Turney proposed an unsupervised learning algorithm to classify the sentiment orientation of reviews. The mutual information difference between the given word or phrase and the words “poor” and “excellent” was calculated respectively to measure its semantic orientation; then the average semantic orientation of all the words in a given text was regarded as the overall semantic orientation. Pang et al. employed such classification models as Naïve Bayesian model, Maximum Entropy model and Support Vector Machine model to classify the semantic orientation o</context>

A topic sentiment sentence is defined as a sentence bearing both the topic concept and sentiment towards that topic. The topic sentiment sentences in a Chinese review are the intersection of the topic sentences and sentiment sentences in it. Topic sentiment sentences are representative for sentiment analysis because, firstly, they are homogeneous in topic. And more importantly, the sentiment bearing in these sentences refer to the same topic. This makes sentiment in each sentence computable. Earlier works like Turney (2002) or Pang et al (2002) don’t take into account the topic and the sentiment relating to that topic together as a whole, thus makes the result less reliable in that the sentiment words and phrases processed are not homogeneous in topic. Secondly, the degree of semantic similarity between topic sentiment sentences and the topic of the review reflects a potential relatedness between the topic sentiment sentences and their corresponding semantic parts. The more a topic sentiment sentence is similar in meaning to the topic, the more likely it appears in the viewpoint presentation part or conclusion p</context>
