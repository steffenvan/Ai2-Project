Since van der Sandt and Geurts have put
forward and extensively applied the notion
of a fundamental identity of presupposition
and anaphora, something like a universal

is, and further supposing that it entails an

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998863928571428">
Since van der Sandt &amp; Geurts (1991), van der
Sandt (1992) and Geurts (1995, 1999) have put
forward the notion of a fundamental identity of
presupposition and anaphora, a fairly universal
consensus seems to have developed that this
view is basically correct. Assuming that this
notion is intended to have empirical
consequences I shall refer to this view in the
following as the &apos;Presupposition is Anaphora
Hypothesis&apos;, for short: the PIA hypothesis.
There is surely no doubt that phenomena of
presupposition and anaphora are not unrelated.
Understanding anaphora quite conventionally as
a way of resuming a previously established
reference more or less involves the assumption
that this reference has actually been established
beforehand and in this sense is presupposed. In
this rough and general sense anaphora is
presuppositional.
Conversely, in presupposing that one or the
other proposition is true, a relation is established
to something that either was said before, follows
from something that was said before, or at least
could reasonably have been said before; and this
relation may in some rough and general sense be
called anaphorical.
Now Geurts and van der Sandt do not stay at a
rough and general level, but turn these relations
between anaphora and presupposition into a
venerable theory of presupposition that yields
certain technical advantages for the treatment of
presupposition when it is implemented in (a
variety of) Discourse Representation Theory
(van der Sandt (1992) and Geurts (1995, 1999)).
I shall argue below that despite this technical
progress the PIA hypothesis obscures both the
notion of presupposition and the notion of
anaphora. The Procrustean relationship actually
harms our understanding of both phenomena. At
the same time, I shall argue, the Hypothesis is
empirically wrong with respect to linguistic data.
I shall start with the latter.

1 Empirical Problems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994799">
There are at least the following sets of data that
would seem to cause difficulties for the PIA
hypothesis:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9965164">
(a) some definite full NPs that carry the usual
presuppositions are not adequately handled
as anaphorical;
(b) presuppositions that are part of the lexical
semantics of various predicate expressions
bear at least no obvious relation to anaphora;
(c) some definite full NPs that are used in a
clear sense anaphorically don&apos;t seem to carry
the expected presuppositions;
(d) a number of anomalies can be observed with

anaphorically used personal pronouns with
regard to their presuppositional contents.
I shall attend to each set of data in turn in the
following subsections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999454">
1.1 Non-anaphoric definite NPs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999624111111111">
I assume a semantics for definite NPs that
follows Löbner (1985); for short: a definite NP
is analysed as expressing (or, if you prefer,
denoting or even referring to) a function, in the
sense that it yields a unique value for (whatever
may be) its arguments.
Some definite NPs achieve their functional
characteristic by virtue of properties of their
context of occurrence: e.g.,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.886502375">
(i) by plain resumption of a previously
established discourse referent: A woman entered
the room. The woman was wearing black. Or,
(ii) by a more indirect, but still recoverable,
relation to an established discourse referent (so-
called bridging reference): A bicycle stood by the
entrance. The handle bar was missing. Or,
(iii) by reference to the utterance situation:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.826136">
This month shows a new decrease in
unemployment.
Other definite NPs, however, would appear to be
definite merely by virtue of their lexical and
(internal) compositional semantics. Examples
are the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999003571428571">
(1) the sum of 3 and 4
(2) the first thing that comes to mind when
one thinks of Aalborg
(3) the April 2001 unemployment figures for
Germany
(4) the beauty of a sunset
(5) the H2O molecule
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.712755">
The presuppositions that are triggered by the use
of such expressions are reasonably clear:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99007575">
(1&apos;) There is a unique thing that is the sum of
3 and 4.
(2&apos;) There is a unique thing that first comes
to mind first when one thinks of
Aalborg.
(3&apos;) There is a unique set of figures that is
the April 2001 employment figures for
Germany.
(4&apos;) There is a unique thing that is the beauty
of a sunset.
(5&apos;) There is a unique thing that is the H2O
molecule.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999192862068966">
But the notion that there should be an
anaphorical relation between the presupposing
expressions in (1)-(5) and their preceding, or
embedding, context that would be related in any
relevant way to the interpretation of (1)-(5) is
hard to grasp. I take it rather that these NPs
would rather demonstrate that presupposition
may occur without anaphora. If one implements
an algorithm for the processing for definite NPs
that handles (1)-(5) by first accommodating the
relevant entities as discourse referents (”global
accommodation”) and then lets the newly
accommodated objects be bound by them, this
would just obliterate the difference between the
contributions of lexical and compositional
semantics on the one hand and of discourse
semantics on the other. If one appreciates this
difference, one should be rather reluctant to
make it technically disappear in the processing
mechanism. The more so, because it adds
nothing to the understanding of definiteness and
if the expressions in (1)-(5), used out of the blue
or in any case without actual discourse
antecedents, are declared anaphors, it would be
hard to see what is left of the notion of anaphora.
&amp;quot;Anaphoric&amp;quot; would come to mean roughly the
same as &amp;quot;related to any not explicitly stated
background knowledge&amp;quot; and would lose any
specific connection the current discourse.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998351">
1.2 Lexical presupposition of predicates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998565777777778">
In 1.1 we have just been looking at definite
referential expressions that seem to lack an
anaphorical character. There are also predicate
expressions that clearly carry presuppositions,
but have very little, if anything, to do with
anaphora.
In (6) to (8) - and obviously many analogous
cases - the (a)-sentences carry presuppositions as
expressed by the corresponding (b)-sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994912333333333">
(6) a. Fred&apos;s a bachelor.
b. Fred&apos;s an adult.
(7) a. Fred ignored me.
b. Fred noticed me.
(8) a. Fred closed the door at 5.
b. The door was open at 5.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994488375">
The idea in cases of this kind is that the structure
of a lexical item assumes a distinction between
what is asserted and what is presupposed
whenever the lexical item is predicated of an
object. - But where is the anaphora? And
anaphoric interpretation of (9) is truth-
conditionally equivalent to
supposing you find one (there is no natural limit
to ingenuity): What would be the explanatory
value of anaphora in cases of this kind?
Similarly related to lexical semantics would be
presuppositions that are attached to such diverse
discourse markers as but, although, even,
anyway - and also for those cases I just fail to
understand where there would be an interesting
connection to anaphora.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998195">
1.3 Epithet NPs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995212">
A class of definite NPs often used for anaphoric
resumption of currently prominent discourse
referents are so-called epithets like the old
grocer or, even less complimentary, the dirty
swine, the old goat, etc. The literal lexical
content of these NPs however, does not enter the
truth conditions of the corresponding sentences.
The referents need not be shopkeepers of more
than the expected age, or dirty or old specimen
of family Suidae or genus Capra. Surprisingly,
though, when the same expressions are used
non-anaphorically and in a focus position (and
perhaps prosodically marked) they have exactly
this literal meaning and trigger the
corresponding presuppositions.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.942459571428572">
(9) When I arrived at Jones’s office, the old
grocer greeted me with the bill.
(10) When I arrived at Jones’s office, the old
GROcer greeted me with the bill.
(10&apos;) When I arrived at Jones’s office, it was
the old GROcer who greeted me with the
bill.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.968255192307692">
In (9), where the expression the old grocer is
prosodically unmarked, it is naturally interpreted
with anaphoric reference to Jones and no old
shopkeeper plays any role. In (10) and (10&apos;),
with the intonationally marked grocer, no
anaphoric reference to Jones comes about, but
instead a presupposition is triggered that leads to
the accommodation of a new discourse referent
as the reference for the old grocer - with the
properties of being old and a shopkeeper.
In occurrences of this kind there is actually a
choice between either anaphora or presup-
position in the interpretation of the definite NP;
but each clearly excludes the other. The
(9&apos;) When I arrived at Jones&apos;s office, he
greeted me with the bill.
and the old grocer in (9) - without affecting truth
conditions - merely expresses an attitude of the
speaker towards Jones. This option is available
only in contexts where the intended referent is
unambiguously established and any lexical
material in the definite anaphor is irrelevant for
the purposes of referent selection. In such
contexts we also find semantically vacuous
anaphors like that son of a gun, the guy, the
chap, the fellow, etc.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999281">
1.4 Emphatic pronouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973266666667">
If the PIA hypothesis is to hold generally, it
must hold also for anaphoric definite personal
pronouns. Interestingly, however, we find the
same discrepancy here as under 1.3. For clear
evidence we must look at gender languages. In
German anaphoric personal pronouns we
typically find mere formal gender congruence
with the antecedent NP - with no semantic
content. If, however, a contrast accent is placed
on the pronoun, the pronoun&apos;s gender is
interpreted semantically as sex (cf. Bosch 1988).
Hence the unacceptability of (12) despite the
acceptable (11) and (13), where either the
intonation marking is missing or the
interpretation of gender as sex is admissible:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99778425">

<bodyText confidence="0.978408666666667">

</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997499">

gestern im Chez Nous gesehen hast.
[If you want to turn your neighbour1 off
his girl friend2, you must tell HIM1 that
you saw HER2 in the Chez Nous
yesterday.]
On the PIA hypothesis, there is no obvious way
of distinguishing between the condition in which
the coreference relations are supported by the
semantic content of the pronouns (13) and the
condition where the pronouns&apos; semantic content
is plainly irrelevant or even excluded ((11) and
(12)). - In order to describe the difference we
need a distinction between anaphoric processes
and processes that use presupposition based on
lexical semantic content.

2 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984244444445">
Theories that are empirically incorrect - or
incorrect with respect to one or the other detail -
may still be conceptually enlightening and give
us a fundamentally correct model of the pheno-
mena in question. I doubt that this is the case for
the PIA hypothesis. It obliterates a distinction
between two phenomena that are different in an
interesting way: The business of anaphora
proper is the maintenance of reference in
discourse (I am not talking here of the entirely
different phenomenon of bound or &amp;quot;syntactic&amp;quot;
anaphora (cf. Bosch 1983), which is rather a
morphosyntactic matter and has nothing to do
with either reference or presupposition).
Presupposition on the other hand - and here I
agree with van der Sandt (1992) - is not
essentially bound up with reference, but is an
inferential mechanism that contributes to dis-
course coherence in its own way by constraining
the notion of contextual acceptability - pretty
much the way proposed in van der Sandt (1988).
The attempt to iron out some of the remaining
difficulties in the latter approach by reducing
presupposition to anaphora may be technically
viable (but since this is not my issue here, I
choose to remain agnostic with respect to this
question), but it assumes a notion of anaphora
that is, I believe, eventually not very helpful.
My unsolicited advice, then, is this: Let us grant
that van der Sandt and Geurts have demonstrated
a very close connection, that was previously
never properly detailed, between anaphora and
presupposition. This much understood, we had
better turn to some of the questions where
current insight about anaphora and presup-
position is pretty poor and where we may still
learn a lot more about both phenomena and their
relation. I am thinking, in particular, of the
possibly very different relation of anaphora and
presupposition to compositionality: One may
reasonably hold that presupposition relations can
be modelled compositionally. There is no way,
however, as far as I can see for a realistic
compositional model of anaphoric relations. -
But this is clearly a topic for another paper.
