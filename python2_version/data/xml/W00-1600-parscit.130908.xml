It is well-established that the parsing problem for higher-level constraint-based formalisms such
as LFG, PATR, and HPSG is in the NP-hard complexity class. Thus there are worst-case sen-
tences and grammars for which there are no known polynomial algorithms Unhappily, the most
straightforward parsers for these formalisms tend to be exponential not only in the worst cases but
also for the common cases of sentences and grammars that intuitively seem to be less complex.
Research aimed at improving performance has typically accepted the inherently exponential nature
of the problem and has then focused on implementation techniques that can lower the space/time
computational resource curves but without actually changing their shape.
In this talk I will discuss an alternative stragegy that we have been exploring in our work on
LFG parsing. Instead of taking the exponential as a given for arbitrary grammars and asking how
we can make it more palatable, we studied a restricted class of LFG grammars whose languages are
obviously context-free. We then asked a different question: why doesn&apos;t a conventional LFG parser
recognize these languages in cubic time, their theoretically obtainable bound? We developed a few
key ideas that taken together provide for cubic performance for the special case of a completely
context-free-equivalent LFG grammar, and provide nearly cubic performance for the less restricted
set of LFG grammars that are linguistically relevant.
