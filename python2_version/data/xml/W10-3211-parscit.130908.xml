Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999973">
This paper presents the proposed Query
Expansion (QE) techniques based on
Khmer specific characteristics to improve
the retrieval performance of Khmer Infor-
mation Retrieval (IR) system. Four types
of Khmer specific characteristics: spelling
variants, synonyms, derivative words and
reduplicative words have been investi-
gated in this research. In order to evalu-
ate the effectiveness and the efficiency of
the proposed QE techniques, a prototype of
Khmer IR system has been implemented.
The system is built on top of the popu-
lar open source information retrieval soft-
ware library Lucene1. The Khmer word
segmentation tool (Chea et al., 2007) is
also implemented into the system to im-
prove the accuracy of indexing as well as
searching. Furthermore, the Google web
search engine is also used in the evalua-
tion process. The results show the pro-
posed QE techniques improve the retrieval
performance both of the proposed system
and the Google web search engine. With
the reduplicative word QE technique, an
improvement of 17.93% of recall can be
achieved to the proposed system.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999088">
Similar to the other major languages in the world,
the number of Khmer digital content has been
rapidly growing over the world-wide web, and it is
becoming very difficult to obtain the relevant in-
formation as needed from the Internet. Although

some major web search engine providers such as
Google has a localized version of Khmer in its web
search engine2, it is not specifically designed for
Khmer due to the lack of integration of Khmer spe-
cific characteristics. Consequently, it misses a lot
of information of Khmer websites found in the In-
ternet. For this reason, we propose the QE tech-
niques using the specific characteristic of Khmer
to improve the effectiveness of Khmer IR system.
Four types of QE technique are proposed based
on the four types of Khmer specific characteris-
tic that are spelling variants, synonyms, deriva-
tive words (Khin, 2007) and reduplicative words
(Long, 2007). Moreover, a prototype of Khmer IR
system is implemented in order to evaluate the ef-
fectiveness of these proposed QE techniques. The
proposed system is built on top of the popular
open source information retrieval software library
Lucene in order to take the advantage from its pow-
erful indexing and searching algorithms. Further-
more, to improve the accuracy of indexing and
searching, we have also implemented the specific
Khmer word segmentation into the system. Due to
the lack of Khmer text collection which is required
in the evaluation process, we have also created our
own Khmer text corpus. The corpus has been built
to be useful and beneficial to all types of the re-
search in Khmer Language Processing.

with India, Khmer has been heavily influenced by
the Sanskrit and Pali. However, Khmer still pos-
sesses its own specific characteristics so far such
as the word derivation rules and word reduplica-
tion techniques. Furthermore, the specific written
rule is also found in Khmer, for instance the case
of multiple spelling words. These characteristics
are very useful especially in the Khmer IR due to
the lexical-semantic relation between the words.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998481">
2.1 Spelling Variants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872">
In Khmer, multiple spelling words exist. They
have same meaning and pronunciation but only
different in spelling. Most of the spelling variants
are loan words, and others are the result of the sub-
stitutability between characters. For example:
- The word សមុų [sămŭt] &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; ,which is orig-
inated from Sanskrit, can also be spelled
សមុទ្ទ[sămŭt] &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; (Khmer Dictionary,
1967) which is originated from Pali.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996991">
2.2 Synonyms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956285714286">
Synonyms exist in all the natural languages. Thus,
there is no exception for Khmer as well. Khmer
has rich and variety of synonym vocabularies.
Most of these synonyms are found in the loan
words ( influenced by Sanskrit and Pali ) and the
social status&apos;s words. For instance the word [T71
&amp;quot;to eat&amp;quot; has many synonyms for each social status:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99565">
2.3 Derivative Words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989455">
Derivative words in Khmer are the words which
are derived from the root words by affixation, in-
cluding prefixation, infixation and suffixation (Jen-
ner, 1969). Interestingly, derivative word&apos;s mean-
ing is semantically related to its root word. For
example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.826175">
ចា ស់ &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; + កញ (prefix) →កǽæ ស់ &amp;quot;very old&amp;quot;Ĉើរ &amp;quot;to walk&amp;quot; + មណ (infix) →ដំČើរ &amp;quot;the walk&amp;quot;ឯករា ជ¢ &amp;quot;independence&amp;quot; + ភា ព (suffix) →
ឯករា ជ¢ភា ព &amp;quot;the state of independence&amp;quot;
</equation>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.978542">
2.4 Reduplicative Words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962571428571">
Reduplicative words are very common in Khmer.
They are used for several purposes including em-
phasis, pluralization and complex thought expres-
sions. Three kinds of duplicating techniques are
found in Khmer: word duplication, synonym du-
plication and symmetrical duplication (Noeurng
and Haiman, 2000).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.860352">
2.4.1 Word duplication
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.815438571428572">
Word duplication is the process of duplicating a
word to express pluralisation meaning. The dupli-
cation symbol &apos;&apos;ៗ&apos;&apos; is put after the word to indicate
the duplication. For example:
Ĩ្ក
W1 1 [chhke thum thum] &amp;quot;many big dogs&amp;quot;
្ក
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.721859">
2.4.2 Synonym duplication
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99965475">
Also called synonym compounding words. This
kind of words are created by combining two dif-
ferent words which are either synonyms or related
meaning. For example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.956996333333333">
បំណង &amp;quot;goal&amp;quot; + ʄ ថាñ &amp;quot;intention&amp;quot;→
បំណងʄ ថា &amp;quot;goal and intention&amp;quot;
ñ
ី
Ū [krei] (similar phonetic syllable) + Ū [krar]
&amp;quot;poor&amp;quot;→Ūី Ū [krei krar] &amp;quot;very poor&amp;quot;
</equation>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.399784">
2.4.3 Symmetrical duplication
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99939875">
Symmetrical duplication is the process of cre-
ating a word by combining a word and its simi-
lar phonetic syllables. It is similar to create words
which sound like &amp;quot;zigzag&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hip hop&amp;quot; in English.
This duplication technique is usually used to em-
phasize the meaning of the original word. There
are quite remarkable amount of this kind of words
found in Khmer. For example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.7689025">
ធំ [thum] &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; + Đ ង [théng] (similar phonetic
syllable) →ធំĐ ង [thum théng] &amp;quot;very big&amp;quot;

3 Khmer Text Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998742714285714">
A large collection of Khmer text is required in the
evaluation process. Due to the lack of Khmer lan-
guage resource especially the Khmer text corpus,
we have built our own Khmer text corpus. The cor-
pus was designed to be useful and beneficial to all
(impolite word), ពិសា (polite word), ឆា ន់ (reli-
gious word), ɏយ (royal word) and etc.

kinds of the research in Khmer language process-
ing. Building such text corpus for Khmer is a chal-
lenging task since there is no implementation yet
on Khmer optical character recognition, and a few
research in Khmer have been done . All texts have
to be collected manually from various Khmer web-
site in the Internet. The corpus includes some basic
corpus annotations such as word annotation, sen-
tence annotation and part-of-speech annotation. It
was encoded in eXtensible Corpus Encoding Stan-
dard (XCES) (Nancy et al., 2000) to assure the fu-
ture extensibility. Figure 1 illustrates the whole
process of building a Khmer text corpus in which
four main steps were carried out: text collection,
preprocessing tasks, corpus annotations and cor-
pus encoding. The detail of each step is described
in the following subsections:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99907">
3.1 Text Collection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999869">
Collecting Khmer digital text is the most difficult
and time consuming task in the process of build-
ing this corpus. As there is no implementation on
Khmer optical character recognition, it is not pos-
sible to scan or extract Khmer texts neither from
books nor from other paper sources. However,
thanks to the websites as well as Khmer blog com-
munity that provide the valuable Khmer digital
texts for this research. All text were manually col-
lected from all the available sources.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999934">
3.2 Preprocessing Tasks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999601875">
The texts collected from the Internet are usually
not clean and unstructured. It may contain un-
wanted elements such as images, links and some
HTML elements. Therefore, cleaning process is
carried out to remove the unwanted elements and
to restructure the texts before proceeding to the
next step.
After cleaning, each text is categorized by its do-
main according to its content by the labeling pro-
cess. There are twelve domains in this corpus:
newspaper, magazine, medical, technology, cul-
ture, history, law, agriculture, essay, novel, story
and other. The text descriptions such as author&apos;s
name, publisher&apos;s name, publishing date and pub-
lisher&apos;s digital address, are kept along with each
text.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999009">
3.3 Corpus Annotations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865">
Corpus annotation information is very important
for the corpus-based research. Therefore, this cor-
pus also includes the sentence annotation, word an-
notation and POS annotation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.847287">
3.3.1 Sentence Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9961135">
Each sentence is annotated with three kinds of
information: position, identification and length.

<listItem confidence="0.972204375">
1. Position: it is defined by the position of the
first character and the last character of a sen-
tence in the text.

2. Identification: the sequence number of a sen-
tence within a text file.
3. Length: the number of characters of a sen-
tence.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.961527">
Like English, each sentence in Khmer can be sep-
arated by special symbols. In modern Khmer,
there exists a series of characters that are used to
mark the boundaries of different kind of sentences
(Khin, 2007). Based on these characters, each sen-
tence in a text can be separated easily.

Khmer is non-segmented script. There is no sepa-
rator between words which is very difficult to seg-
ment. In order to do that, we have used the Khmer
word segmentation tool (Chea et al., 2007) devel-
oped by PAN Localization Cambodia4.

used a Khmer POS tagger which is based on the
work of Nou et al. where a transformation-based
approach with hybrid unknown word handling for
Khmer POS tagger is proposed (Nou et al., 2007).
There are 27 types of Khmer tagset which can be
obtained by this Khmer POS tagger. Each obtained
POS tag is assigned to each word in the corpus, and
it is kept along with the word annotation.

To assure the extensibility of corpus and the fa-

corpus has been encoded in eXtensible Corpus
Encoding Standard (XCES) (Nancy et al., 2000).
XCES is an XML-based standard to codify text
corpus. It is highly based on the previous Cor-
pus Encoding Standard (Nancy, 1998) but using
XML as the markup language. Since the corpus
encoding is based on XML, the corpus is suitable
for many programming languages which support
XML. Furthermore, it can fully take the advan-
tage of the powerful XML framework including
XQuery, XPath and so on. In addition, XCES sup-
ports many types of corpora especially the annota-
tion corpora which our corpus is based on. The en-
coding of annotation files and text description files
are conformed to XCES schema version 1.0.4.

<bodyText confidence="0.999965428571429">
Query Expansion is a technique commonly used in
IR (Manning et al., 2009) to improve retrieval per-
formance by reformulating the original query. We
have proposed four types of QE technique based
on the four types of Khmer specific characteristics
that we have presented in the section 2. During
the expansion process, the original search query is
analyzed and expanded corresponding to the type
of words (Figure 2). Four types of QE is carried
out: spelling variants expansion, synonym expan-
sion, derivative word expansion and reduplicative
word expansion. The expanded query is obtained
after adding the the expansion term to the original
query.

4.2 Khmer IR System Design and
Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999913125">
A prototype of Khmer IR system, which is shown
in the Figure 3, has been implemented to evalu-
ate the efficiency of the proposed QE techniques.
There are two main processes in the system im-
plementation: indexing and searching. We have
started to implement the system by constructing
searching index from the text corpus. All texts in
the corpus are tokenized into words. Then these
words are indexed by the Lucene&apos;s indexer, and
stored in an index database. On the other hand in
the searching part, the search query is tokenized
into words before being analyzed in the QE pro-
cess. Finally, the search results are obtained by
the Lucene&apos;s searcher which searches through the
index database and returns results that correspond
to the expanded query.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993405">
4.3 Indexing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977833333333">
Indexing is very important because it determines
what search results are returned when a user sub-
mits query. Our proposed system&apos;s indexer is
based on the Lucene&apos;s indexer with the modifi-
cations adapted to Khmer language. Lucene in-
dexes a document by indexing the tokens, which
are words, obtained by tokenizing text of the doc-
ument (Hatcher et al., 2009). Since the default
Lucene&apos;s tokenizer can only work with segmented
western languages such as English or French
where spaces are used between each word, it is
impossible to tokenize document in Khmer which
belongs to the class of non-segmenting language
group, where words are written continuously with-
out using any explicit delimiting character. Khmer
word tokenizer, which is developed by the a re-
search group of Cambodia PAN Localization, has
been used to handle this task.

The experiment to evaluate the proposed QE tech-
niques was initially conducted only on the proto-
type of the Khmer IR system that we have imple-
mented. As Google also has a localized Khmer
version of its popular web search engine, and it
can explicitly specify websites to be searched5,
we have extended our experiment to Google web
search engine in order to obtain more precise re-
sult.

ternet, was used for the experiments. A web-
site, which contains all documents from the cor-
pus, was hosted in our laboratory&apos;s web server in
order that these documents can be indexed by the
Google&apos;s indexer. Then we followed up the index-
ing progress by consulting the Google Webmaster
Tools6 service. In Khmer where words are writ-
ten one after the other, word processing programs,
Internet browsers and other programs that format
text need to know where they can cut a sentence
in order to start a new line. This kind of problem
does not appear in the western languages where
space are used between words. Thus, the zero-
width space character was proposed to solve this
problem by inputting the zero-width space at the
end of each word while typing7. In Unicode, the
zero-width space character is a type of space char-
acter but it is invisible. Using the zero-width space
is very confusing because of the invisibility of the
character, plus it is unnatural to Khmer writing sys-
tem. As a result, most people only partly used it
for the text display purpose. Therefore, we can
find the zero-width space in almost all Khmer texts
found in the Internet. Since all texts in the cor-
pus are collected from the Internet, the zero-width

were carried out to the both systems. Due to the
small size of the text corpus, only ten original
queries have been chosen for each type of experi-
ment. Each query possesses a specific topic in or-
der that we can judge the relevant results after. The
experiment processes are as following:
1. Input ten original queries into the both sys-
tems, and calculate the precisions and recalls.
All queries are selected from the different top-
ics, and each query contains at least an ex-
pandable word corresponding to its expansion
type.

digital thesaurus yet, the expansions were manu-
ally done by respecting the query syntax of Lucene
and Google8. Moreover, as Google web search
engine cannot tokenize Khmer words, the tok-
enization was also done manually. For example:
the query តុលា ការģ្មរŪ ហម &apos;&apos;Khmer Rough tri-
bunal&apos;&apos; consists two words តុលា កា រ &apos;&apos;tribunal&apos;&apos; and
ģ្ម រŪ ហម &apos;&apos;Khmer Rough&apos;&apos;. We know that the syn-
onym of តុលា កា រ &apos;&apos;tribunal&apos;&apos; is សាលា ក្ដី &apos;&apos;tribunal&apos;&apos;.
So the expanded query for our proposed system is
techniques, while the increase in recall at 6.32%,
19.00%, 4.37%, 5.97% after applying the QE tech-
niques respectively to Google web search engine.
In addition, comparing our proposed system
with QE to Google web search engine without QE,
the recall improvement is 17.29%, 24.60%, 6.34%,
14.37% respectively, while to Google web search
engine with QE, the recall improvement is 10.97%,
5.60%, 1.97%, 8.40% respectively.
As a summary, the search results using our pro-
posed system with QE techniques is significantly
better than the conventional Google search results.
This can be seen clearly from the improvement of
F-Measure 21.03%, 17.00%, 5.15%, 10.09% re-
spectively.
&apos;&apos;ត លា ការģ្មរŪ ហម OR សាលា ក្ដីģ្មរŪ ហម&apos;&apos;. On 6 Conclusion and Future Works
the other hand, the expanded query for Google is

However, the improvement in precision after uti-

main problems that we will tackle in our future re-
search to reduce non-relevant contents by seman-
tically analyzing Khmer content. At the moment
the size of the corpus is very small, and we are ac-
tively dealing with this issue in hope to provide a
good Khmer language resource for the future re-
search in Khmer language processing.
In addition, due to the lack of research in Khmer
IR as well as in Khmer language processing, a lot
of aspects can still be worked on in order to im-
prove the system performance. For example, the
improvement of Khmer word segmentation and
the building of Khmer thesaurus for IR system,
which are expected to improve the IR system per-
formance, are also in the priority tasks of our future
works.

Length: the number of characters of a word. Khmer is non-segmented script. There is no separator between words which is very difficult to segment. In order to do that, we have used the Khmer word segmentation tool (Chea et al., 2007) developed by PAN Localization Cambodia4. 3.3.3 Part-of-Speech Annotation To enhance the usefulness of the corpus, we also include the Part-of-Speech annotation. We have used a Khmer POS tagger which is based on the work of Nou et al. where a transformation-based approach with hybrid unknown word handling for Khmer POS tagger is proposed (Nou et al., 2007). There are 27 types of Khmer tagset which can be obtained by this Khmer POS tagger. Each obtained POS tag is assigned to each word in the corpus, and it is kept along with the word annotation. 4Cambodia PAN Localization: http://www. pancambo</context>

Finally, the search results are obtained by the Lucene&apos;s searcher which searches through the index database and returns results that correspond to the expanded query. 4.3 Indexing Indexing is very important because it determines what search results are returned when a user submits query. Our proposed system&apos;s indexer is based on the Lucene&apos;s indexer with the modifications adapted to Khmer language. Lucene indexes a document by indexing the tokens, which are words, obtained by tokenizing text of the document (Hatcher et al., 2009). Since the default Lucene&apos;s tokenizer can only work with segmented western languages such as English or French where spaces are used between each word, it is impossible to tokenize document in Khmer which belongs to the class of non-segmenting language group, where words are written continuously without using any explicit delimiting character. Khmer word tokenizer, which is developed by the a research group of Cambodia PAN Localization, has been used to handle this task. 5 Experiments The experiment to evaluate the proposed QE techniques was initially conducted only on the prototype of the Kh</context>

Thus, there is no exception for Khmer as well. Khmer has rich and variety of synonym vocabularies. Most of these synonyms are found in the loan words ( influenced by Sanskrit and Pali ) and the social status&apos;s words. For instance the word [T71 &amp;quot;to eat&amp;quot; has many synonyms for each social status: 2.3 Derivative Words Derivative words in Khmer are the words which are derived from the root words by affixation, including prefixation, infixation and suffixation (Jenner, 1969). Interestingly, derivative word&apos;s meaning is semantically related to its root word. For example: ចា ស់ &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; + កញ (prefix) →កǽæ ស់ &amp;quot;very old&amp;quot;Ĉើរ &amp;quot;to walk&amp;quot; + មណ (infix) →ដំČើរ &amp;quot;the walk&amp;quot;ឯករា ជ¢ &amp;quot;independence&amp;quot; + ភា ព (suffix) → ឯករា ជ¢ភា ព &amp;quot;the state of independence&amp;quot; 2.4 Reduplicative Words Reduplicative words are very common in Khmer. They are used for several purposes including emphasis, pluralization and complex thought expressions. Three kinds of duplicating techniques are found in Khmer: word duplication, synonym duplication and symmetrical duplication (Noeurng and Haiman, 2000). 2.4.1 Wor</context>
