<bodyText confidence="0.9996095">
This paper describes the all-word sense disam-
biguation task provided by Estonian team at
SENSEVAL-2. About 10,000 words are manually
disambiguated according to Estonian WordNet
word senses. Language-specific problems and
lexicon features are discussed.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999623212121212">
We got interested in word sense disambiguation
(WSD) for two reasons. First, already a couple
of years ago it was evident that WSD is beco-
ming one of the new &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; topics in computatio-
nal linguistics and language engineering as our
knowledge of how to handle semantic parame-
ters of texts and semantic features of words in
texts increased. The second reason was purely
practical. Since 1996 we have been involved in
a large project of building a semantic database
of Estonian; participating in the EuroWordNet
project has been a part of it (but a very impor-
tant part, of course). The main source of buil-
ding this database have been different corpora
of Estonian, and in working with corpora the
question of whether we are dealing with diffe-
rent meanings of a word in case of its concrete
occurrences or not arises constantly. So we got
interested in the possibility to use some objec-
tive methods here.
Our task was all-words task. This choice is
explained with our &amp;quot;practical&amp;quot; interests explai-
ned above.
A large amount of work was done to provide
training data where disambiguation was done
manually. The same kind of work had to be
done with test data, of course. The description
of this work is given below. Let us note already
here that this work appeared to be very useful
and informative for us as builders of Estonian
WordNet (EstWN).
And let us stress that this was our first at-
tempt of WSD at all.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999761941176471">
The test and training texts come from Corpus
of the Estonian Literary Language (CELL), the
1980-s. We used this part of the corpus, that
was morphologically disambiguated, initially for
the syntactic analysis.
The morphological analysis was made with
ESTMORF (Kaalep, 1997). Lemma and word
class in the output of the program are relevant
to our task, but it is impossible to get them
without morphological disambiguation, because
of frequent homonymy among word forms.
All training texts and most of test texts (5
of 6 total) are fiction. One of the test texts is
from newspaper. Six training and six test files
provided for the task contain about 2000 tokens
each. More information about the texts used in
the task is in Table 1.

2.1 Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918833333333">
The Estonian part of EuroWordNeti served as
the lexicon. Like other wordnets, EstWN is
a lexical-semantic database, the basic unit of
which is concept. Concepts are represented as
synonym sets (synsets) that are linked to each
other by semantic relations. The description of

EstWN is given in the final document of Eu-
roWordNet (Vider et al., 1999).
EstWN is supposed to cover the Estonian
base vocabulary in its initial version. The base
vocabulary will be determined by statistical
analysis of the reference corpus. Even so it is
not always easy (nor appropriate) to stop enco-
ding words with frequencies below a certain th-
reshold. For this reason we expect EstWN to
cover more than just the base vocabulary.
Still the EstWN is rather small, there were
9436 synsets, 13277 words and 16961 senses (li-
terals) in it when the disambiguation was done.
That makes about 1.28 senses per word as ave-
rage.
Most of synsets are connected with hypero-
nym-hyponym relations building corresponding
hierarchies.

2.2 Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998555">
Four linguists disambiguated the texts, each
text was disambiguated by two persons. Only
nouns and verbs were disambiguated, as ente-
ring adjectives into EstWN is in the very begin-
ning. The sense number was marked according
to sense number in EstWN. If the word was mis-
sing from the EstWN, &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; was marked as sense
number, and if the word was in EstWN, but
missed the appropriate sense, &amp;quot;+1&amp;quot; was mar-
ked.
If inconsistencies were met, they were discus-
sed until agreement was achieved. On about
28% of the cases the disambiguators had diffe-
rent opinions.
One of the problems that the disambiguators
ran into concerned dividing words into diffe-
rent senses in EstWN. It turned out as over-
differentiation word meaning marked as too
specific, or over-generalisation—word meaning
marked as too general.

2.3 How much the lexicon covers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999448">
Not all senses found in EstWN are represented
in texts. Maximum number of senses per word
found in texts is 13. This is more than app-
ropriate senses in lexicon (see Table 3), but we
must remeber about the &amp;quot;+1&amp;quot; that disambigua-
tors had, if they found that there are not enough
meanings in EstWN. Table 2 describes distri-
bution of senses in usage and Table 3 shows the
top of lemmas according to number of senses.

It would be the best, if all words to disambi.
guate were in the lexicon with all their possibl€
meanings. Apparently this presumption is not
met.
The number of compounds in Estonian is in-
definite. It is quite easy for a writer to in-
vent new compounds that are not in any dic-
tionary, but nevertheless are easily understood
by readers. That is one reason, why there are
so many sense numbers &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; in the texts. About
46 % of words that are not in EstWN, are com-
pounds.
Another remarkable class of words not in
lexicon are proper names, as there are no pro-
per names in EstWN. There are 17.5 % of words
proper names.
If we will postpone phrasal verbs and some
strange words that contain hyphens (about

<bodyText confidence="0.982718571428571">
7 %), it leaves us with about half thousand
words to check why they are not in EstWN.
But why are there missing senses (tagged
with &amp;quot;-1-1&amp;quot;)? The reason is simply historical:
such words were included into EstWN as sy-
nonyms of some base vocabulary word and the
other senses of them are not considered yet.

2.4 Phrases and multi-word units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927571428572">
The initial format of text was as it came
from ESTMORF and semantic disambiguation:
every word on separate line, followed by an adi-
tional line of morphological analysis and sense
number, with multi-word phrase marked if word
was part of it. The task to convert into Senseval
XML format seemed trivial at first, but phrases
turned out to be problematic. Unfortunately
enough, all the story about phrases is concer-
ning the training corpus only, because in test
corpus the multi-word phrases were unmarked.
Estonian is a flective language with a free
word order and that makes it complicated to
figure out all phrases. The elements of a ph-
rase can be scattered around the sentence in an
unpredictable order.
In the initial texts, the disambiguators mar-
ked down the whole phrase on the line where
the phrase occured. They were not told to mark
it on each line, where the non-disambiguatable
parts of the phrase were, and it happened that
the phrase was not marked on the line, where
the head of the phrase was. The algorithm of
calculating head or satellite took into account
the part of speech and the form. For verb phra-
ses, if both components were verbs, declinable
form of verb infinitive was marked as satellite.
For noun phrases, substantive makes head and
adjective satellite. If both words are substanti-
ves, head is the second one... well, mostly.
However, it is known that expressions tend to
contain frozen forms, including inflectional en-
dings. For example, one may not say &amp;quot;*Human
Right&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;*Humans Right&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Human Rights&amp;quot;
is the only correct expression and should be ad-
ded into thesauri in such form. Phrasal verbs
like &amp;quot;ara maksma&amp;quot; (to pay off) and idiomatic
verbal expressions like &amp;quot;end tiikkideks naerma&amp;quot;
(to laugh oneself into pieces) represent a situa-
tion that is different from the occasion desc-
ribed above: the verb part may inflect freely,
but the other word(s) are frozen forms. He-
reby, even if we have determined what is phrase
or collocational multi-word unit, we still have a
question are they commonly used and should
we add them into the lexicon.
Multiword expressions are included into
EstWN if they build up a conceptual unit and
are commonly used as lexical units.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999577357142857">
Results of WSD of corpus texts turned to be
a good way to add missing synsets and sen-
ses into our wordnet. There were significant
inconsistencies in opinions of these people, who
disambiguated the texts. This shows us the
most problematic entries in EstWN, the need
to reconsider the borders of meaning of some
concepts. By now, the last version of EstWN
contains 9524 synsets, 13344 words and 17076
senses.
For an inflectional language like Estonian,
morphological analysis is extremely important
and morphological and semantic disabiguation
can help each other.
