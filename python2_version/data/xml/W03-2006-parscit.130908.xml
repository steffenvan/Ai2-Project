A corpus-based diachronic analysis of
patent documents, based mainly on the
morphologically productive use of certain
terms can help in tracking the evolution of
key developments in a rapidly evolving
specialist field. The patent texts were o b-
tained from the US Patent &amp; Trade Marks
Office’s on-line service and the terms
were extracted automatically from the
texts. The chosen specialist field was that
of fast-switching devices and systems.
The method presented draws from liter a-
ture on biblio - and sciento -metrics, infor-
mation extraction, corpus linguistics, and
on aspects of English morphology. This
interdisciplinary fram ework shows that
the evolution of word-formation closely
shadows the developments in a field of
technology.

A patent document is written to pe rsuade a techno-
legal authority that the patentee should be allowed
to manufacture, sell, or deal in an article to the ex-
clusion of other persons. The article is typically
based on an invention that the patentee(s) claim
has been theirs. The term article is important in
that it refers to a tangible object and its u sage is to
emphasise that ideas, intangibles essentially, ca n-
not be patented. Patent documents are the repos i-
tory of how technology advances and, more
importantly, show how language supports the
change.
The techno-legal authority requires the patent
document to follow a template. This template is
divided broadly into two parts: first, legal te m-

plates comprising pate ntee’s details, jurisdictional
scope, and related item; second, technical
templates divided into a summary of the patentee’s
claims, relation of the article to previously patented
articles – the so-called prior art – and the scien-
tific/technical basis of the claim. The scientific
claim is written in a language that is similar to the
language of journal p apers.
One important task that is slowly emerging is
the extent to which the analysis of a patent doc u-
ment can be automated particularly to a ssess the
overlap between the claims in the document about
the article to be patented with that of related, rel e-
vant and even counter-claims about the article.
The related and relevant claims and counter claims
may be found in existing patent documents and
may, more indirectly, exist in journal papers.
A patent document has to make references to
all other relevant/related articles that have been
patented prior to the invention of the art icle, which
is yet to be patented and is the object of the patent
document. The references are made primarily by
citing the name of the prior art patentees and the
titles of their patent documents. A patent doc u-
ment also has other linguistic descriptions of prior
art; such descriptions are reminiscent of citations
of journal papers in a journal paper. The overlap of
a new patent document with a set of existing patent
documents may suggest the impact of extant
knowledge in patent documents on emerging
knowledge in the new patent document. Such an
overlap has been studied by the impact of US
semiconductor technology on the rest of the world
(Appleyard and Kalsow: 1999): this overlap relies
largely on the fr equency of citation of a US patent
by the name of its author or the author’s place of
work. In computational linguistic (CL) terms thi s
exercise relies on proper noun extra ction.
The patent document relates to an explicit and
exclusive right over an intellectual property. A
journal article relates to an implicit and inclusive
right over an intellectual property. The overlap
between these two forms of claims is crucial not
only in ascertaining the rights of the patentee, or
the abuse of the rights of others by the patentee,
but also for monitoring the effectiveness of r e-
search based on a specialism as a whole or that of
its component groups.
The effect of one author or a group of authors
working in an institution is indirectly mea sured by
the so-called impact factor. This factor relates to
the frequency of citation of one or more journal
papers written by an author or by a group. The
calculation of the impact fa ctor relies mainly on
computing the frequency of the authors’ name(s)
within a corpus of journal articles. Such an impact
factor type calculation is used typically in bibl i-
ometrics (Garfield 1995). Again, as in intra -patent
impact studies mentioned above, in CL terms this
is an exercise in proper noun identification and
extraction.
The analysis of a patent document, together
with the analysis of the related corpora of other
patent documents and intellectual property doc u-
ments, should be based on a framework which
provides methods and techniques for analysing the
contents of the document and of the corpora. For
us the source of a framework still lies in linguistic
and language studies. Here we are particularly
interested in word formation and terminology u s-
age in highly specialised disc iplines particularly
those disciplines that deal with intangible articles
coupling the word formation and terminology u s-
age with the citation patterns of proper nouns
brings us closer to analysing the contents of a pat-
ent document and its siblings distributed over co r-
pora.
Information scientists usually use the referen c-
ing data of research documents to analyse know l-
edge evolution in scientific fields as well as to
identify the key authors, institutes, and journals in
specific domains, using tools such as publication
counts, citation analysis, co-citation analysis, and
co-term analysis to do so. In recent years, patent
documents have gained considerable attention as a
valuable resource that can be use d to analyse tech-
nology advances using the same tools.
Gupta and Pangannaya (2000) have applied
bibliometric analysis to carbon nanotube patents to
measure the growth of activity of carbon nan otube
industries and their links with science. They have
also used patents data to study the country -wise
distribution of patenting activity for the USA, J a-
pan, and other countries. Sector -wise performances
of industry, academia and government, and the
active players of carbon nanotubes were also stu d-
ied. They describe the nature of inventions taking
place in this particular field of technology, and the
authors claim to have identified the emerging r e-
search directions, and the active companies and
research groups involved.
Meyer (2001) has used citation analysis
and co-word analysis of patent documents and sc i-
entific literature to explore the interrel ationship
between nano-science and nano -technology. Meyer
investigated patent citation relations at the orga n-
izational levels along with geographical locations
and affiliations of inventors and authors. The term
co-occurrence is used by Meyer to find the rel a-
tionship between the patent documents and the two
scientific literature databases SCI and INSPEC. He
has noticed that ‘...the terms that occur frequently
in the document titles of all databases are related to
[...] instrumentalities and/or are located in fields
that are generally associated with substantial indu s-
trial research activity’ (2001:177). Meyer has a r-
gued that ‘Our data suggests that nano -technology
and nano-science are essentially separate and he t-
erogeneous, yet interrelated cumulative stru ctures’
(2001:164).
The study of word formation through n e-
ologisms within the special language of science
and technology has led some authors to argue that
it is the scientists as technologists who attempt to
rationalise our experience of the world around us
in written language by using new words or forms
or by relexicalising the existing stock (see Ahmad
2000 for relevant references). Some lexicogr a-
phers (see for example Quirk et al. 1985) have su g-
gested that neologisms can be formed by two
processes: First, the addition or combination of
elements such as compounding: Resonant Tunne l-
ing Diodes and Scanning tunneling microscopy are
examples for this type of neologism (compoundin g
as a neologism formation is used extensively in
science and technology literature); Second, the r e-
duction of elements into abbreviated forms. The
abbreviations FET (Field E ffect Transistor) and
MOSFET (Metallic Oxide Semiconductor FET)
are examples of this type.
Neologisms appear to signal the emergence of
new concepts or artefacts and the frequency of this
new word might indicate the scientific comm u-
nity’s acceptance of this new concept or artefact.
Effenberger (1995) has argued that ‘... the faster a
subject field is developing, the more novelties are
constructed, discovered or created. And these no v-
elties are talked and written about. In o rder to
make this technical communication as efficient as
possible, provision should be made for avoiding
misunderstanding. One crucial point in this process
is the vocabulary that is being used’ (1995:131,
emphasis added).
In this paper we discuss the idiosyncratic la n-
guage used in patent documents. The language is
replete with terms and there are instances within a
patent document that suggest that the authors not
only use the specialist terms but use a local syntax
as well. We look specifically at the structure of the
US Patents and suggest how with existing tec h-
niques used in information extraction and NLP,
including term extraction and proper noun identif i-
cation, one can perform fairly complex tasks in
patent analysis – some of which are performed by
patent experts by hand currently (Section 2). This
examination suggests to us a model of develo p-
ment in computer and semi-conductor technology:
an incremental model where each subsequent pa t-
ent helps in the development of ever -complex arti-
facts – starting from devices onto circuits and onto
systems. We will look at one of the key inventions
in the field of semiconductors physics – the elec-
tron tunneling device. These devices co mbine
technical elegance, experimental complexity and
manufacturing challenge. Due to its strategic i m-
portance, a number of patents have been obtained
by the US government and also by a nu mber of US
and Japanese companies (Section 3). Section 4
concludes this paper.
The Structure of US PTO Documents
and a Local Grammar for the Docu-
ments
The USPTO database is a representative sa mple of
patent documents. The USPTO has documents r e-
lated to most branches of science and technology.
It includes information about all US patent doc u-
ments since the first patent issued in 1970 to the
most recent. The USPTO database a llows the user
to search the full text of the patent documents for a
certain word or a combination of words. It also
provides a field search for specific information
such as inventor or assignee. The search can also
be conducted for a specific year or range of years.
The US Patents are written partly as a legal text
and partly as a scientific document. Over the last
50 years or so, it appears that US Patent doc uments
have been structured in terms of layout and have a
superficial resemblance to Marvin Minsky’s
frame-like knowledge representation schema.
The patent document can be divided into
three main parts for the present discussion: The
first part comprises the biographical details of the
inventors (and their employers) together with the
title of the invention and a brief free -text abstract,
dates when the patent was applied for and when
the patent was granted and so on. The free text is
essentially a summary of the claims of the pa t-
entee; The second part contains external references
of three sorts: the first sort is the specialist domain
of the invention – the subject class indicating the
super-ordinate class and instances; the se cond sort
are other cited patents organised as a 4 -tuple: (i)
patent number, (ii) date of approval, (iii) first i n-
ventor and (iv) classification number; and, the third
sort is a bibliographic reference to public ations that
may have contributed to the pa tent; The third part
of a current US Patent document comprises
‘claims’ related to the patent and the d escription of
the ‘invention’ (there are diagrams of the inve ntion
attached to the document and the diagrams d e-
scribed in the text). Table 1 on the next page shows
the template of the current (c. 1980 and a fter)
USPTO’s.
The ‘claims’ of the patentees are clearly
itemised and initialised by the number of the claim;
the first claim is the basis of the patent abstract
generally. The ‘background to the invention’ is
written in an idiosyncratic fashion as well – the
invention is first contextualised in a broader group
of other inventions to date and then the specific
nature of the invention is exemplified. The
broader and the specific are usually marked by
phrases like ‘The (present) invention relates to’
and the specificity is phrased as ‘(more) specif i-
cally.’ or ‘(more) pa rticularly’. These phrases are
followed by one or more noun phrases connected
with, for example, conjunctions or qualifiers. The
first noun phrase names the article invented, for
instance, a name of a new device, circuit or a fabr i-
cating or testing process.

The NP comprises determiners and modal verbs
together with (compound) nouns. The first NP is
optionally followed by a qualification that restricts
or extends the scope of the disco very – the
enlargement or restriction is named and another
NP is used for the naming and so on. This simple
grammar can be verified by exa mining a corpus of
patent documents. To illustrate this point we have
looked at a recent randomly selected patent on
memory devices – a patent filed by Kabushiki Ka i-
sha Toshiba of Japan (or Toshiba for short), and
approved by USPTO on 20 th May 2003, on a sem i-
conductor memory device which uses the emergent
notion of memory cells (a memory cell is a tiny
area within the memory array tha t actually stores
the bit in the form of an electrical charge 1). An
analysis of the title and that of the ‘Background of
the Invention: Field of I nvention’ fields shows the
use of this restricted syntax (Table 2). In much the

same as the ‘claims’ and ‘th e ‘background’, the
‘summary of the invention’ is also phrased in a
formulaic manner (see Table 1 for the structure of
the patent document).
The analysis of the other slots governed by
a simpler grammar yields interesting results and
suggests that the name s of assignees and the ma n-
ner in which patents are being cited can be easily
inter-related (Table 3). Toshiba’s USPTO
6567330 refers to 8 other patents. The details of
the referenced patents are in a 4 -tuple, which can
be unambiguously interpreted. Each of the refer-
enced patents refers to about 10 patents in turn.
An examination of 82 such patents may help to
initiate, perhaps, a discussion of the ‘invention life
cycle’ or ‘licensing potential of a patent’ (Mogee
1997), or even a discussion of ‘micro fo undations
of innovation systems’ (Ande rsen 2000).

shiba Japan) shows the major influence of US -
based assignees, followed by Japan. A significant
number of patents (8.5%) are held by individuals
and not assigned specif ically to a country.
A semi-automatic analysis of terms used in
the Abstracts and Titles of the patents (Toshiba
6567330 and patents referenced in the Toshiba
patents) shows the co -citation pattern o f terms.
This may help in the clustering of patents on the
basis of terms extracted from the patent doc uments
as well as novel terms (terms not included in the
USPTO Patent Classification terminology data
base) found in the document. We show the co -
citation of the two key terms memory cell and
memory device in the nine patents discussed above.
The use of the two terms individually and as roots
and stems of other compounds is also shown. The
more frequent citation is to the newer term memory
cell and it is cited in all but one of the 9 related
patents. The related memory devices – newer de-
vices now incorporate memory cells – is less fre-
quently used and it is only found in the abstracts of
5 out of the 9 patents. Both terms are co -cited in 6
out of the 9 patents (see Table 5 for details).
The interrelationship between the different
patents can be explored further by examining
closely as to what is being patented within the pa t-
ent and what is being patented in the referenced
patents. Again, we use the e xample of the Toshiba
patent No. 6567330 which refers to 8 other patents.
The patent itself relates to the invention of a sys-
tem. The referred patents relate to other systems
and circuits. Let us look at the earliest patent cited
in Toshiba’s patent: this is US PTO No. 5386388
filed by Intel Corporation (USA) approved in
January 1995. The title of I ntel’s patent is ‘Single
cell reference scheme for flash memory sensing
and program state verification’. Flash memory is
defined as ‘A nonvolatile programmable semicon-
ductor memory product 2. This patent relates to the
invention of a circuit. Intel’s patent comprises re f-
erences to another 15 patents: 5 refer to other sy s-
tems, 8 to circuits, and one each to a device and a
software program (see Figure 1 on th e next page).
The information whether a patent is r elated to any
of the four classes can be gleaned from the Patent
Classification Number. Further analysis of the
referenced patents shows a similar pattern – refe r-
ences to circuits, devices, systems and software.
This appears to be a basis of the inventions within
the semiconductor industry, especially those r e-
lated to the development of computer systems
based on these systems, devices and circuits. This
is the basis of our more speculative investig ations
related to the resonant tunneling systems.

3 The Evolution of the Resonant
Tunneling Devices
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993618823529412">
We will now focus on how terminology u sage may
help in tracking the evolution of resonant tunne l-
ing devices. These are ultra high-speed devices,
which perhaps will be used in the compute rs of the
next decade or so. In order to study how one can
track technology progress we have adopted an i n-
tuitive, but realistic, framework. For us, all co m-
plex systems comprise subsystems and subsystems
are made up of much smaller (and simpler) de-
vices. A computer system is made up of integrated
circuits and the circuits made up of transistors and
transistors come in different types. One model of
growth can be thought of as follows: First, devices
are patented, then subsystems, and finally the
complex systems (remember only tangible articles
can be patented). So following this intuitive
framework we will first see a number of devices
being patented then subsystems and finally the sy s-
tems themselves. Tunnel diodes are supposed to
empower faster switching devices, which in turn
have to be incorporated into subsystems with tu n-
neling transistors and into complex systems with
circuits. Our hypothesis is that an analysis of a
diachronically organized text corpus will show the
working of the above -mentioned framework.
A corpus was built containing more than
2.2 million words of patent documents. The co r-
pus contains all patent documents that co ntain the
term tunneling in the title. USPTO search r esults
showed that there are 372 titles, approved from
1975 to 1999 in semiconductor physics. We have
analysed frequency of compound word in the
USPTO patent documents published b etween
1975-1999 (Table 6).

and other symbols) is considered by Sy stem Quirk
to be a compound word (see Ahmad and Rogers,
2001, for details). The validation of compound
words can also be carried out by statistical tests,
for instance described by Smajda (1994).
To investigate the progress of resonant
tunneling devices and circuits, the multi-word
terms were extracted from the USPTO full text
corpus using System Quirk. The extracted terms
that relate to resonant tunneling diodes, resonant
tunneling transistors and resonant tunneling ci r-
cuits were arranged in a five year interval starting
from the first emergence of the term resonant tun-
neling in USPTO abstract documents in 1985.
Tracking the frequency usage of the terms

crease of frequency usage i nterval by interval. The
frequency of the term resonant tunneling diode
(and its plural form resonant tunneling diodes,
both denoted as the lemma resonant tunneling d i-
ode~ subsequently) increased significantly from 45
in 1985-1989 to 446 in 1990-1994 by about a fac-
tor of 19 and then in the next time interval 1995 -
1999 the frequency dropped by about half to 240.
The frequency usage of the term resonant tunne l-
ing transistor~ in the USPTO full text corpus i n-
creased from 23 in the p eriod 1985-1989 by about
a factor of 10 to 225 in 1990 -1994. The increase of
frequency usage of the term in the time period
1995-1999 increased by a factor of 1.3 to become
293. The term resonant tunneling circuit~ appears
in the USPTO full text co rpus 45 times in the time
interval 1990-1994. Frequency usage of resonant
tunneling circuits increased by a factor of 1.3 in the
next interval (1995 -1999) to 57.
Word formation is not restricted to the i n-
flection of a compound word. Rather, we see fu r-
ther instances of compounding where an existing
compound, say, resonant tunneling di-
ode/transistor is used as a head of other co m-
pounds (Table 7).

of the term resonant tunneling d iode &amp; transistor
over a 10 year period in our patent corpus
We note the very productive use of compoun ding
and inflection in our corpus. Note, however, that
the size of the corpus for the three different peri-
ods, 1985-89, 90-94 and 95-99, are different:
378272, 771525 and 995894 respectively. The
size of the corpus perhaps for the later two p eriods
is roughly the same but the earlier corpus (85 -89)
is three times smaller. In order to pr esent a better
comparison we will look at the relative frequency
of the compounds in that we will sum up the fr e-
quency of all the extracted compounds related to
resonant tunneling diodes, transistors and circuits,
as per our intuitive fram ework, and assign relative
frequency to each of the three relative to the sum.
Consider the result of analysis of 133 texts
of patents published in 1990 -1994 for tunnel diode
related patents. The total number of terms co m-
prising the lemma resonant tunneling diode~ is
490, which includes the lemma on its own and two
terms containing the lemma as the headword; these
are multiple peak resonant tunne ling diode, barrier
resonant tunneling d iode. The total containing the
lemma resonant tunneling transistor is 225, which
is made up of 188 for the lemma on its own and the
rest for the two other terms. The lemma RT circuit
also includes hyponyms of the term, e.g. RT oscil-
lator (circuit), RT logic gate (circuit) and RT mem-
ory (circuit) ; note that the term circuit is shown in
parentheses as it is ellipsed in the text – the reader
of the patents, an expert in the discipline, is
expected to know that an oscillator is a circuit.
The two terms occur 24 and 12 times t ogether with
4 other terms that collectively occur 9 times ma k-
ing a total of 45. The three lemmas RT diode,
transistor and circuit occur for a total of 490 + 225
+ 45 (= 760) times, hence the relative fr equency of
the three lemmas is 64.4% (490/760), 29.6%
(225/760) and 6% (45/760) respectively (Table 8
shows a breakdown of the distributio n).
This relative frequency computation was
conducted over the periods 1985 -1989 and 1995-
1999. Table 9 (on the next page) shows that over
64% of the terms belong to the lemma resonant
tunneling diode~, about 30 % to resonant tunneling
transistor and just about 6% to resonant tu nneling
circuit ~. This situation changes quite dramatically
in the next quinquennium (1995-1999).

It appears that there is a local grammar, compris-
ing vocabulary of the specialist domain and a sy n-
tax that appears different from the general
(universal?) syntax, used in framing the claims,
background and summary of the invention in a US
Patent document. A number of slots in the US
PTO document are reserved for proper na mes –
patentees, assignees, places of work, and other
slots hold dates and all these slots show the e x-
tremes of the local grammar – essentially a gram-
mar for a one-word language. The document
comprises ‘references to (other patents) and also
citations to an extant by other later patents – this
information is encoded in another local grammar
of one or more 4 -tuples referring to a referenced
patent – the 4-tuple has a clearly defined s equence
and allows expressions only in terms of four noun -
phrases. The referenced patent number is an active
hyperlink through which the details of the refe r-
enced patent can be accessed and subsequently a
chain of references can be established in a (semi -)
automatic manner. The existence of a local gra m-
mar and the hyperlinks s uggests to us that one can
create a historic (diachronic) description of an
invention together with the crucial account of the
influence of other inventions.
Restricted syntax is used, for example, in
describing time (hours, minutes, seconds, days,
years, months), in financial news wire as well as
mission-critical communication. The specialist
vocabulary, and more so the productive use of the
vocabulary (see below for details), as well as the
restricted syntax emerges initially for assuring a m-
biguity-free communication in an inherent noisy
medium of communication – natural language.
Complementary to the emergence of the
present US patent document, there has been an a c-
cumulation of terminological knowledge in terms
of the repositories usually referred to as patent
classification. The Patent Offices around the
world classify all manners of ‘art icles’ ranging
from micro -electronics to kitchen utensils and from
software systems to heavy excavation machinery,
for example. Much like a number of other utilita r-
ian classification systems, including the Dewey
Decimal Classification on the one hand and the US
National Library of Medicine’s Disease Classific a-
tion system on the other, the US PTO classification
system is detailed, complex, full of cross refe r-
ences, and occasionally confusing. The fact r e-
mains, however, that like all utilita rian systems, the
US PTO classification system is a rich repository
that can be used, with some alterations, as the lex i-
cal/terminological resource for information extra c-
tion in particular and NLP in general. The
repository states the ontological commitment of the
US PTO and its advisers, and can be used for
building knowledge representation schema or s e-
mantic processing sy stems.
The appearance of a local grammar, or
perhaps local grammars, used to frame a patent
document together with an extensive terminology
database of patent classification, is good news for
the patent processing community. There is some
hope that the information extraction and NLP sy s-
tems will be able to extract the terminology and
identify the idiosyncratic syntax that governs the
different parts of the patent document with the help
of techniques pioneered in corpus linguistics.
Terminology extraction can be facilitated by refe r-
ring to the patent classification terminology base
and facilitated by various statistical and linguisti c
techniques used to identify complex noun -phrases
in specialist texts. Once the local grammar is ide n-
tified it will be able to meaningfully process the
documents for inferring the imp ort of a given in-
vention in relation to other inventions and to assess
the impact of journal publications of inventions.
And, indeed all manner of new ways of examining
a patent document may open up once the investig a-
tor overcomes the burden of sifting th rough an
overgrowing lexical mountain of new patents, rev i-
sions to existing patents and the scientific and
technical publication juggernaut that adds more to
the mountain on almost daily basis. The aut omatic
extraction of compounds from a corpus of patent
documents appears to show the introduction of
new artifacts through the use of morphological
processes like word formations. Cu rrently, our
work in progress is to ‘chart’ a transfer of such
terms in journal papers onto patents, in a ddition to
the exercise reported which charts the transfer of
terms within a diachronically organised corpus of
patent documents.

Meyer has a rgued that ‘Our data suggests that nano -technology and nano-science are essentially separate and he terogeneous, yet interrelated cumulative stru ctures’ (2001:164). The study of word formation through n eologisms within the special language of science and technology has led some authors to argue that it is the scientists as technologists who attempt to rationalise our experience of the world around us in written language by using new words or forms or by relexicalising the existing stock (see Ahmad 2000 for relevant references). Some lexicogr aphers (see for example Quirk et al. 1985) have su ggested that neologisms can be formed by two processes: First, the addition or combination of elements such as compounding: Resonant Tunne ling Diodes and Scanning tunneling microscopy are examples for this type of neologism (compoundin g as a neologism formation is used extensively in science and technology literature); Second, the r eduction of elements into abbreviated forms.

Effenberger (1995) has argued that ‘... the faster a subject field is developing, the more novelties are constructed, discovered or created. And these no velties are talked and written about.

The effect of one author or a group of authors working in an institution is indirectly mea sured by the so-called impact factor. This factor relates to the frequency of citation of one or more journal papers written by an author or by a group. The calculation of the impact fa ctor relies mainly on computing the frequency of the authors’ name(s) within a corpus of journal articles. Such an impact factor type calculation is used typically in bibl iometrics (Garfield 1995). Again, as in intra -patent impact studies mentioned above, in CL terms this is an exercise in proper noun identification and extraction. The analysis of a patent document, together with the analysis of the related corpora of other patent documents and intellectual property doc uments, should be based on a framework which provides methods and techniques for analysing the contents of the document and of the corpora. For us the source of a framework still lies in linguistic and language studies. Here we are particularly interested in word formation and terminology u sage in highly specialised d</context>

In recent years, patent documents have gained considerable attention as a valuable resource that can be use d to analyse technology advances using the same tools.

The analysis of the other slots governed by a simpler grammar yields interesting results and suggests that the name s of assignees and the ma nner in which patents are being cited can be easily inter-related (Table 3). Toshiba’s USPTO 6567330 refers to 8 other patents. The details of the referenced patents are in a 4 -tuple, which can be unambiguously interpreted. Each of the referenced patents refers to about 10 patents in turn. An examination of 82 such patents may help to initiate, perhaps, a discussion of the ‘invention life cycle’ or ‘licensing potential of a patent’ (Mogee 1997), or even a discussion of ‘micro fo undations of innovation systems’ (Ande rsen 2000).

Meyer has a rgued that ‘Our data suggests that nano -technology and nano-science are essentially separate and he terogeneous, yet interrelated cumulative stru ctures’ (2001:164). The study of word formation through n eologisms within the special language of science and technology has led some authors to argue that it is the scientists as technologists who attempt to rationalise our experience of the world around us in written language by using new words or forms or by relexicalising the existing stock (see Ahmad 2000 for relevant references). Some lexicogr aphers (see for example Quirk et al. 1985) have su ggested that neologisms can be formed by two processes: First, the addition or combination of elements such as compounding: Resonant Tunne ling Diodes and Scanning tunneling microscopy are examples for this type of neologism (compoundin g as a neologism formation is used extensively in science and technology literature); Second, the r eduction of elements into abbreviated forms. The abbreviations FET (Field E ffect Transistor) and MOSFET (Metallic Oxide Semiconductor FET) are examples of this type. Neologisms appear to signal the emergence of new concepts or artefacts and the frequenc</context>

The system extracts compound words based on a si mple heuristic: a set of word that does not co ntain closed class words (i.e. determiners, conjunctions, prepositions, and moderators) or the orthographic signs (including punctuation, numbers, currency and other symbols) is considered by Sy stem Quirk to be a compound word (see Ahmad and Rogers, 2001, for details). The validation of compound words can also be carried out by statistical tests, for instance described by Smajda (1994). To investigate the progress of resonant tunneling devices and circuits, the multi-word terms were extracted from the USPTO full text corpus using System Quirk. The extracted terms that relate to resonant tunneling diodes, resonant tunneling transistors and resonant tunneling ci rcuits were arranged in a five year interval starting from the first emergence of the term resonant tunneling in USPTO abstract documents in 1985. Tracking the frequency usage of the terms associated with resonant tunneling artefacts in the USPTO full text corpus shows a considerable i nSemiconductor ftfw US Patent656</context>
