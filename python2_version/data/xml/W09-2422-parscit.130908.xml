The task to classify a temporal relation be-
tween temporal entities has proven to be dif-
ficult with unsatisfactory results of previous
research. In TempEval07 that was a first at-
tempt to standardize the task, six teams com-
peted with each other for three simple relation-
identification tasks and their results were com-
parably poor. In this paper we provide an anal-
ysis of the TempEval07 competition results,
identifying aspects of the tasks which pre-
sented the systems with particular challenges
and those that were accomplished with relative
ease.

The automatic temporal interpretation of a text has
long been an important area computational linguis-
tics research (Bennett and Partee, 1972; Kamp and
Reyle, 1993). In recent years, with the advent of
the TimeML markup language (Pustejovsky et al.,
2003) and the creation of the TimeBank resource
(Pustejovsky et al., 2003) interest has focussed on
the application of a variety of automatic techniques
to this task (Boguraev and Ando, 2005; Mani et al.,
2006; Bramsen et al., 2006; Chambers et al., 2007;
Lee and Katz, 2008). The task of identifying the
events and times described in a text and classifying
the relations that hold among them has proven to be
difficult, however, with reported results for relation
classification tasks ranging in F-score from 0.52 to
0.60.
Variation in the specifics has made comparison
among research methods difficult, however. A first

attempt to standardize this task was the 2007 Tem-
pEval competition(Verhagen et al., 2007). This
competition provided a standardized training and
evaluation scheme for automatic temporal interpre-
tation systems. Systems were pitted against one an-
other on three simple relation-identification tasks.
The competing systems made use of a variety of
techniques but their results were comparable, but
poor, with average system performance on the tasks
ranging in F-score from 0.74 on the easiest task to
0.51 on the most difficult. In this paper we provide
an analysis of the TempEval 07 competition, identi-
fying aspects of the tasks which presented the sys-
tems with particular challenges and those that were
accomplished with relative ease.

For the competition, training and development
data—newswire files from the TimeBank corpus
(Pustejovsky et al., 2003) —was made available in
which the events and temporal expressions of in-
terest were identified, and the gold-standard tempo-
ral relation was specified (a simplified set of tem-
poral relations was used: BEFORE, AFTER, OVER-
LAP, OVERLAP-OR-BEFORE,AFTER-OR-OVERLAP
and VAGUE.1). For evaluation, a set of newswire
texts was provided in which the event and temporal
expressions to be related were identified (with full
and annotated in TimeML markup) but the temporal
relations holding among them withheld. The task in
was to identify these relations.
The text below allows illustrates the features of
the TimeML markup that were made available as

identify the relationship between the events and the
document creation time t13 (BEFORE for e2 and
OVERLAP for e20). Task C was to identify the
relationship between e2 and e20 (OVERLAP-OR-

of a total of 162 document. This amounted to a total
of 1490 total relations for Task A, 2556 for task B,
and 1744 for Task C. The 20 documents of testing
data had 169 Task A relations, 337 Task B relations,
and 258 Task C relations. The distribution of items
by relation type in the training and test data is given
in Table 1.
Six teams participated in the TempEval compe-
tition. They made use of a variety of techniques,
from the application of off-the shelf machine learn-
ing tools to “deep” NLP. As indicated in Table 22,
while the tasks varied in difficulty, within each task
the results of the teams were, for the most part, com-

The systems (other than XRCE-T) did somewhat
to quite a bit better than baseline on the tasks.
Our focus here is on identifying features of the
task that gave rise to difficult, using overall per-
formance of the different systems as a metric. Of
the 764 test items, a large portion were either
’easy’—meaning that all the systems provided cor-
rect output—or ’hard’—meaning none did.

where Ck is the number of items k systems got
correct. This simply the proportion of total correct
responses to items in a class (for all systems) divided
by the total number of items in that class (a success
measure of 1.0 is easy and of 0.0 is hard). For exam-
ple, let’s suppose before relation have 10 instances.
Among the instances, three cases are correct by all
teams, four by three teams, two by two teams, and

Table 3 provides the overall analysis by relation
type. This shows that (as might be expected) the
systems did best on the relations that were the ma-
jority class for each task: overlap in Task A, before
in Task B, and overlap in Task C.
Furthermore systems do poorly on all of the dis-
junctive classes, with this accounting for between
1% and 9% of the task error. In what follows we will
ignore the disjunctive relations. Performance on the
before relation is low for Task A but very good for
Task B and moderate for Task C. For more detailed

and tense&amp;aspect marking for event expressions. In-
formation about the temporal expression turned out
not to be a relevant dimension of analysis.
As we seen in Table 4, verbal event expressions
make for easier classification for before and after
(there is a 75%/25% verb/noun split in the data).
When the target relation is overlap, nouns and verbs
have similar SMs.
One reason for this difference, of course, is
that verbal event expressions have tense and aspect
marking (the tense and aspect marking for nouns is
simply none).
In Table 5 we show the detailed error analy-
sis with respect to tense and aspect values of the
event expression. The combination of tense and
aspect values of verbs generates 10 possible val-
ues: future, infinitive, past, past-perfective, past-
progressive (pastprog), past-participle (pastpart),
present, present-perfective (presperf), present-
progressive (presprog), and present-participle (pres-
part). Among them, only five cases (infinitive, past,
present, presperf, and prespart) have more than 2
examples in test data. Past takes the biggest por-
tions (40%) in test data and in errors (33%). Over-
lap seems less influenced with the values of tense
and aspect than before and after when the five cases
are considered. Before and after show 0.444 and
0.278 differences between infinitive and present and
between infinitive and present. But, overlap scores
0.136 differences between present and past. And a
problem case is before with past tense that shows
0.317 SM and 9% EP.
When we consider simultaneously SM and EP of
the semantic class of events in Table 6, we can find
three noticeable cases: occurrence and reporting of
before, and occurrence of after. All of them have
over 5% EP and under 0.4 SM. In case of reporting
of after, its SM is over 0.5 but its EP shows some
room for the improvement.

Boguraev and Ando (2005) report a slight in-
crease in performance in relation identification
based on proximity of the event expression to the
temporal expression. We investigated this in Table 7,
looking at the distance in word tokens.
We can see noticeable cases in before and after of
&lt; 16 row. Both cases show over 13% EP and under
0.5 SM. The participants show good SM in overlap
of &lt; 4. Overlap of &lt; 16 has the biggest EP (17%).
When its less satisfactory SM (0.654) is considered,
it seems to have a room for the improvement. One of
the cases that have 13% EP is vague of ≥ 16. It says
that it is difficult even for humans to make a decision
on a temporal relation when the distance between an
event and a temporal expression is greater than and
equal to 16 words.

Table 9 shows most errors in after occur with oc-
currence class 65% (15%/23%) when we consider
23% EP in Table 3. Occurrence and reporting of be-
fore show noticeably good performance (0.818 and
0.949). And occurrence of overlap has the biggest
error rate (17%) with 0.367 of SM.
In case of state, it has 22 examples (7%) but takes
10% of errors. And it is interesting that the most
errors are concentrated in state. In our intuition, it
is not a difficult task to identify overlap relation of
state class.
Table 9 does not clearly show what causes the
poor performance of nouns in after and overlap.
In the additional analysis of nouns with class in-
formation, occurrence shows poor performance in
after and overlap: 0.111/6% and 0.083/8%. And
other noticeable case in nouns is state of overlap:
0.125/4%. We can see the low performance of nouns
in overlap is due to the poor performance of state
and occurrence, but only occurrence is a cause of
the poor performance in after.
DCT can be considered as speech time. Then,
tense and aspect of verb events can be a cue in pre-
dicting temporal relations between verb events and
DCT. The better performance of the participants in
verbs can be an indirect evidence. The analysis with
tense &amp; aspect can tell us which tense &amp; aspect in-
formation is more useful. A problem with the in-
formation is sparsity. Most cases appear less than
3 times. The cases that have more than or equal
to three instances are 13 cases among the possible
combinations of 7 tenses and 4 aspects in TimeML.
Moreover, only two cases are over 5% of the whole
data: past with before (45%) and present with over-
lap (15%). In Table 10, tense and aspect information
seems valuable in judging a relation between a verb
event and DCT. The participants show good perfor-
mances in the cases that seem easy intuitively: past
with before, future with after, and present with over-
lap. Among intuitively obvious cases that are past,
present, or future tense, present tense makes large
errors (20% of verb errors). And present shows 7%
EP in before.
When events has no cue to infer a relation like
infinitive, none, pastpart, and prespart, their SMs
are lower than 0.500 except infinitive and none of
after. infinitive of overlap shows poor performance
with the biggest error rate (0.125/12%).

The task is to identify the relation between consec-
utive main events. There are four part-of-speeches
in Task C: adjective, noun, other, and verb. Among
eight possible pairs of part-of-speeches, only three
pairs have over 1% in 258 TLINKs: noun and verb
(4%), verb and noun (4%), and verb and verb (85%).
When we see the distribution of verb and verb by
three relations (before, after, and overlap), the rela-
tions show 19%, 14%, and 41% distribution each.
In Table 11, the best SM is verb:verb of overlap
(0.690). And verb:verb shows around 0.5 SM in be-
fore and after.

skewed distribution, too. The cases that have
over 1% data are eight: past:none, past:past,
past:present, present:past, present:present,
present:past, presperf:present, and pres-
perf:presperf. Among them, past tense pairs
show the biggest portion (40%). The performance
of the eight cases is reported in Table 12. As we can
guess with the distribution of tense&amp;aspect, most
errors are from past:past (40%). When the target re-
lation of past:past is overlap, the participants show
reasonable SM (0.723). But, their performances are
unsatisfactory in before and after.
When we consider cases over 1% of test data in
main event class pairs, we can see eleven cases as
Table 13. Among the eleven cases, four pairs have
over 5% data: occurrence:occurrence (13%), occur-
rence:reporting (14%), reporting:occurrence (9%),
and reporting:reporting (17%). Reporting:reporting
shows the best performance (0.934/2%) in over-
lap. Two class pairs have over 10% EP: occur-
rence:occurrence (15%), and occurrence:reporting
(14%). In addition, occurrence pairs seem difficult
tasks when target relations are before and after be-
cause they show low SMs (0.317 and 0.200) with
5% and 3% error rates.

4 Discussion and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988290322581">
Our analysis shows that the participants have the dif-
ficulty in predicting a relation of a noun event when
its target relation is before and after in Task A, and
after and overlap in Task B. When the distance is in
the range from 5 to 16 in Task A, more effort seems
to be needed.
In Task B, tense and aspect information seems
valuable. Six teams show good performance when
simple tenses such as past, present, and future ap-
pear with intuitively relevant target relations such as
before, overlap, and after. Their poor performance
with none and infinitive tenses, and nouns can be an-
other indirect evidence.
A difficulty in analyzing Task C is sparsity. So,
this analysis is focused on verb:verb pair. When we
can see in (12), past pairs still show the margin for
the improvement. But, a lot of reporting events are
used as main events. When we consider that im-
portant events in news paper are cited, the current
TempEval task can miss useful information.
Six participants make very little correct predic-
tions on before-or-overlap, overlap-or-after, and
vague. A reason on the poor prediction can be small
distribution in the training data as we can see in Ta-
ble 1. Data sparsity problem is a bottleneck in nat-
ural language processing. The addition of the dis-
junctive relations and vague to the target labels can
make the sparsity problem worse. When we con-
sider the participants’ poor performance on the la-
bels, we suggest to use three labels (before, overlap,
and after) as the target labels.
