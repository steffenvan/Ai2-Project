This paper describes our systems participating in
the English-Chinese track of the NEWS 2009
Machine Transliteration Shared Task.
The apparently free combination of Chinese
characters in names is not entirely ungoverned.
There are no more than a few hundred Chinese
characters which are used in names. Moreover,
beyond linguistic and phonetic properties, many
social and cognitive factors are simultaneously
influencing the naming process and superimpos-
ing on the surface graphemic correspondence.
Our systems in the standard and non-standard
runs aim at addressing two issues in English-
Chinese forward transliteration (referred to as
E2C hereafter), namely graphemic ambiguity and
homophones in Chinese respectively.
By graphemic ambiguity, we refer to the mul-
tiple mappings between English segments and
Chinese segments. For example, the English
segment &amp;quot;ty&amp;quot; could be rendered as 蒂 di4 as in
Christy 克里斯蒂 ke4-li3-si1-di4, or 太 tai4 as
in Style 斯太尔 si1-tai4-er31. Although direct

orthographic mapping (e.g. Li et al., 2004) has
been shown to work even more effectively than
phoneme-based methods (e.g. Virga and Khu-
danpur, 2003), it is observed that phonological
context plays an important role in resolving gra-
phemic ambiguity. In the absence of an explicit
phonemic representation of the source names,
our GAP system, to be described in Section 4.1,
attempts to approximate the local phonological
context for a given segment by means of surface
graphemic properties.
An English name could be acceptably translit-
erated in various ways, e.g. 希拉里 xi1-la1-li3,
希拉利 xi1-la1-li4, 希拉莉 xi1-la1-li4, as well as
希拉蕊 xi1-la1-rui3 are all possible translitera-
tions for Hilary. Homophones are abundant in
Chinese, as evident from the first three alterna-
tives above. However, conventional translitera-
tion models often rely heavily on the distribution
of the training data, which might preclude infre-
quent but similarly acceptable transliteration
candidates. Also, Chinese is a typical tonal lan-
guage. The sound-tone combination is important
in names. Names which sound &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot; are often
preferred to those which sound &amp;quot;monotonous&amp;quot;.
Our SoToP system to be described in Section 4.2
thus attempts to model sound and tone patterns in
parallel, to deal with homophones more reasona-
bly despite possible skewed prior distributions.
Related work will be briefly reviewed in Sec-
tion 2, and the datasets will be described in Sec-
tion 3. The systems for both runs and their per-
formance will be reported in Section 4, followed
by future work and conclusion in Section 5.

lexicons from parallel corpora and other re-
sources (e.g. Kuo and Li, 2008). Second, statis-
tical models are built for transliteration. These
models could be phoneme-based (e.g. Knight and
Graehl, 1998), grapheme-based (e.g. Li et al.,
2004), hybrid (Oh and Choi, 2005), or based on
phonetic (e.g. Tao et al., 2006) and semantic (e.g.
Li et al., 2007) features.
The core of our systems is based on Li et al.&apos;s
(2004) Joint Source-Channel Model under the
direct orthographic mapping framework, which
skips the middle phonemic representation in
conventional phoneme-based methods and mod-
els the segmentation and alignment preferences
by means of contextual n-grams of the translit-
eration segment pairs (or token pairs in their ter-
minology). A bigram model under their frame-
work is thus as follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.999972333333333">
The current study used the English-Chinese
(EnCh) data provided by the shared task organis-
ers. There are 31,961 English-Chinese name
pairs in the training set, 2,896 English-Chinese
name pairs in the development set, and another
2,896 English names in the test set. The Chinese
transliterations basically correspond to Mandarin
Chinese pronunciations of the English names, as
used by media in Mainland China (Xinhua News
Agency, 1992).
The training and development data were
manually cleaned up and aligned with respect to
the correspondence between English segments
and Chinese segments, e.g. Aa/l/to 阿/尔/托, and
the pronunciations for the Chinese characters
were automatically looked up.
Based on all the unique English segments re-
sulting from manual alignment, all possible seg-
mentations of a test name were first obtained,
and they were then ranked using a probabilistic
score computed by:

4.1 Standard Run — GAP
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981833333333">
Our system for the standard run is called GAP,
which stands for Graphemic Approximation of
Phonological context.
Although direct orthographic mapping has
been shown to be an effective method, it is nev-
ertheless observed that phonological context sig-
nificantly contributes to the resolution of some
graphemic ambiguity. For example, the English
segment &amp;quot;le&amp;quot; was found to correspond to as
many as 15 Chinese segments in the data, includ-
ing 利 li4, 勒 le4, 历 li4, 尔 er3, 莱 lai2, 里 li3,
etc. When &amp;quot;le&amp;quot; appears at the end of a name, all
but a few cases are rendered as 尔 er3, e.g. Dale
戴尔 dai4-er3 and Dipasquale 迪帕斯奎尔 di2-
pa4-si1-kui2-er3. This is especially true when
the previous character is &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;. On the contrary,
when &amp;quot;le&amp;quot; appears at the end of a name following
an &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;, it is more often rendered as 利 li4 instead,
e.g. Berle 伯利 bo2-li4. On the other hand, &amp;quot;le&amp;quot;
at the beginning of name is often rendered as 勒
le4 or 莱 lai2, e.g. Lepke 莱普克 lai2pu3-ke4,
except when it is followed by the vowel &amp;quot;o&amp;quot;,
where it is then often transliterated as 利 li4, e.g.
Leonor 利奥诺 li4-ao4-nuo4. Such observation
thus indicates two important points for E2C.
First, the phonological context is useful as Eng-
lish graphemic segments could be ambiguous in
terms of pronunciation, and the actual pronuncia-
tion often determines which Chinese segment is
to be used. Second, local contexts on both sides
are important as they indicate the environment in
which the segment is embedded, which might
affect the way it is pronounced.
GAP thus attempts to approximate local pho-
nological context by means of surface graphemic
properties, making use of bigrams in both direc-
tions. Since the phonological environment might
be sufficiently represented by a neighbouring
phoneme instead of a whole syllable, we ap-
proximate the phonological context with one
character on both sides of a given English seg-
ment, irrespective of their corresponding Chinese

segments. Using single characters on both sides
could also ensure that a small and consistent pa-
rameter space is maintained. Hence, weighting
the context on both sides equally, GAP assigns a
score Score(E,C) to a transliteration candidate
with K segment pairs as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998471666666667">

∏ P(&lt; ek, ck &gt;I lc(ek − 1)) P(&lt; ek, ck &gt;I fc(ek + 1))

<bodyText confidence="0.999867909090909">
where &lt;ek,ck&gt; is the kth English-Chinese segment
pair, lc(ek_1) is the last character of segment ek_1
and fc(ek+1) is the first character of segment ek+1.
Taking the top 3 segmentation candidates, the
transliteration candidates were generated by
looking up the grapheme pairs obtained from
manual alignment with frequency f ≥ 3. If there
is no grapheme pair above the threshold, all pairs
below the threshold would be considered. All
combinations obtained were then subject to rank-
ing with Score(E,C) above.

4.2 Non-standard Run — SoToP
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913090909091">
The homophone problem is notorious in Chinese.
As far as personal name transliteration is con-
cerned, unless there are standardised principles
prescribed, the &amp;quot;correctness&amp;quot; of transliterated
names is not clear-cut at all. As a tonal language,
how a combination of characters sounds is also
important in naming. As in the example given in
Section 1, one cannot really say any of the trans-
literations for Hilary is &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot;, but
perhaps only &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;worse&amp;quot;. Hence naming
is more of an art than a science, and automatic
transliteration should avoid over-reliance on the
training data and thus missing unlikely but good
alternative candidates.
Our system for the non-standard run, SoToP,
thus aims at addressing this cognitive or percep-
tual aspect of transliteration beyond its linguistic
and phonetic properties. Instead of direct ortho-
graphic mapping, we use a Sound model (SoM)
and a Tone model (ToM) in Parallel. The SoToP
architecture is shown in Figure 1.
SoM basically assembles the homophones and
captures the sound patterns in terms of a graph-
eme-phoneme mapping. The operation of SoM
is like GAP above, except that the &lt;ek,ck&gt; pairs
are replaced by &lt;ek,sok&gt; pairs, where sok refers to
the phonetic transcription in Hanyu Pinyin
(without tone) for the kth Chinese segment in a
candidate.
ToM, on the other hand, captures the tone pat-
terns of transliteration, irrespective of the sound
and the character choice. Although English does
not have tones, the intonation and stress of a syl-
lable may prompt for the usage of a Chinese
character of a certain tone. Chinese, on the other
hand, is a tonal language. The tone patterns are
more cognitive in nature, as some combinations
may just sound awkward for no apparent reason.
Moreover, some sound-tone combinations might
result in undesirable homophones, which are also
avoided in names in general. The operation of
ToM is also like GAP, except that the &lt;ek,ck&gt;
pairs are replaced by &lt;ek,tok&gt; pairs, where tok
refers to the tone for the kth Chinese segment in
a candidate.
The Candidate Generator combines the top M
candidates from ToM and top N candidates from
SoM to generate character combinations by look-
ing up a pronunciation table. The lookup table
lists the homophones for each sound-tone com-
bination found in the data. In the current study,
both M and N were set to 3. The generated can-
didates were then ranked by a simple bigram
model based on the bigram probabilities of the
Chinese segments.

4.3 System Testing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996552631579">
The two systems were tested on the NEWS de-
velopment data, containing 2,896 English names.
System performance was measured by the fol-
lowing evaluation metrics: Word Accuracy in
Top-1 (ACC), Fuzziness in Top-1 (Mean F-
score), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), MAPref,
MAP10, and MAPsys. Detailed description of
these metrics can be found in the NEWS shared
task whitepaper (Li et al., 2009).
Table 1 shows the system testing results on the
development data. The standard run, GAP, in
general gives better results than the non-standard
run, SoToP. One possible reason is apart from
the source name segmentation step, SoToP has
more steps allowing error propagation as the
mapping was done separately with sound and
tone, whereas GAP directly maps English seg-
ments to Chinese segments at the graphemic
level.

The two systems were trained on both the train-
ing data and development data together, and run
on the test data. The official results are shown in
Table 2. The performance of the two systems is
in the mid range amongst all participating sys-
tems, including standard and non-standard runs.
Despite the shortcoming and lower performance
of SoToP, modelling the sound and tone patterns
has its merits for handling homophones. For ex-
ample, the expected transliteration for Mcgiveran,
c ( mai4-ji2-fu2-lun2, was ranked 6th by
GAP but 1st by SoToP. The segment &amp;quot;ve&amp;quot; is
much more likely rendered as )� fu1 than as A

preferred tone pattern 4-2-2-2 in this case.

5 Future Work and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986941176471">
Thus we have reported on the two systems par-
ticipating in the NEWS shared task. The stan-
dard run, GAP, relies on direct orthographic
mapping and approximates local phonological
context with neighbouring graphemes to help
resolve graphemic ambiguity. The non-standard
run, SoToP, attempts to address the homophone
issues in Chinese, by modelling the sound and
tone patterns in parallel, and subsequently com-
bining them to generate transliteration candidates.
In general GAP gives better results than SoToP,
while both are in the mid range amongst all par-
ticipating systems. Future work includes more
error analysis and improving the accuracy of in-
dividual steps to minimise error propagation.
The possible combination of the two methods is
also worth further investigation.

In the absence of an explicit phonemic representation of the source names, our GAP system, to be described in Section 4.1, attempts to approximate the local phonological context for a given segment by means of surface graphemic properties. An English name could be acceptably transliterated in various ways, e.g. 希拉里 xi1-la1-li3, 希拉利 xi1-la1-li4, 希拉莉 xi1-la1-li4, as well as 希拉蕊 xi1-la1-rui3 ar</context>

The generated candidates were then ranked by a simple bigram model based on the bigram probabilities of the Chinese segments. 4.3 System Testing The two systems were tested on the NEWS development data, containing 2,896 English names. System performance was measured by the following evaluation metrics: Word Accuracy in Top-1 (ACC), Fuzziness in Top-1 (Mean Fscore), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), MAPref, MAP10, and MAPsys. Detailed description of these metrics can be found in the NEWS shared task whitepaper (Li et al., 2009). Table 1 shows the system testing results on the development data. The standard run, GAP, in general gives better results than the non-standard run, SoToP. One possible reason is apart from the source name segmentation step, SoToP has more steps allowing error propagation as the mapping was done separately with sound and tone, whereas GAP directly maps English segments to Chinese segments at the graphemic level.

There are 31,961 English-Chinese name pairs in the training set, 2,896 English-Chinese name pairs in the development set, and another 2,896 English names in the test set. The Chinese transliterations basically correspond to Mandarin Chinese pronunciations of the English names, as used by media in Mainland China (Xinhua News Agency, 1992). The training and development data were manually cleaned up and aligned with respect to the correspondence between English segments and Chinese segments, e.g. Aa/l/to 阿/尔/托, and the pronunciations for the Chinese characters were automatically looked up. Based on all the unique English segments resulting from manual alignment, all possible segmentations of a test name were first obtained, and they were then ranked using a probabilistic score computed by: K Score(S) z ∏ P(sk I lc(sk − 1)) P(sk I fc(sk + 1)) k=1 where S is a segmentation sequence with K segments, sk is the kth segment in S, lc(s</context>
