This paper proposes the elaboration of the qualia structure of the Generative
Lexicon in [5] and the Extended Generative Lexicon theory [3]. My proposal
is based on the Japanese genitive postposition no. The Japanese “NP1-no
NP2&amp;quot; construction expresses a wider range of relations between two entities
than does the English possessive “NP1&apos;s NP2,&amp;quot; such that the Pustejovskian
qualia roles encoded in NP2 do not supply the necessary relations between
two entities, which [7] succeeded to certain degree. Possessive relation dis-
ambiguation requires enriching lexical entries by incorporating the HAVE
relation into the CONSTITUTIVE role and listing other qualia such as the
ACTIVITY and the SPATIO-TEMPORAL role with the subcategories of
LOCATION and TIME.

2 Various Relations and Argument Reversal

The Japanese genitive marker is semantically very ambiguous. `NP1-GEN
NP2&apos; expresses not only possession as in John’s pen and a part-whole relation
as in John’s leg, but also location, accompaniment, property, quantity, etc.,
as shown in Table 1.

Note the reversal of the possessor argument between (I) and (V–VI).
The possessor argument is NP1 in (I), as in English Tanaka&apos;s bag whose
possessor argument is Tanaka. On the contrary in (V), the possessor of
the bag is NP2 hito “man&amp;quot; and there is no English equivalent big bag’s
person. In (VI) Kaban-no Sanpei “Bags Sanpei,&amp;quot; Sanpei is a bag store,
and therefore the possessor of a bag. The controller-controllee relation is
also reversed, for example, in Tanaka-no kuruma “Tanaka&apos;s car” (type I),
Tanaka is the controller of the car, i.e., NP2 the car is at Tanaka&apos;s disposal
as in English the girl’s car [7]. On the contrary, in boshi-no fujin “the
lady with a hat,&amp;quot; NP1 boshi is at the person’s disposal. Aoi-me-no ningyo
“the doll with blue eyes,” literally, “blue eyes’ doll” in (VIII) even expresses
the part-whole relation in the reverse direction, compared with ningyo-no
me “the doll’s eyes.” Such non-canonical relations, i.e., other than those
expressing possession or a part-whole relation, are more likely expressed in
noun compounds such as magic land or prepositional phrases using of, in,
or with in English.
3 Problems with Deriving Various Possessive Re-
lations from NP2
Possessive relations are ambiguous in both English and Japanese. For ex-
ample, there is more than one interpretation for Tanaka-no hon “Tanaka&apos;s
book.” Tanaka&apos;s book may refer to the book that Tanaka owns or the book

that Tanaka wrote [1,87]. In view of such ambiguity, [4] assumes two syn-
tactic types for John’s depending on whether or not the following noun is
inherently relational. If the following noun is a non-relational common noun
(CN) such as car, John’s composes with car which is regular (et) type, and
the relation between John and car is contextually supplied (1a). On the con-
trary, when John is followed by inherently relational nouns such as brother,
employee and enemy, which are (e,et) type with an extra argument slot,
the relation between John and his brother in John’s brother inherits kinship
from the two-place predicate brother (1b). (2) exemplifies the computation
related to another relational noun, friend.

If we apply Partee&apos;s theory to Japanese examples, most of the possessive
relations are unpredictable, and the contextually supplied relation R remains
largely ambiguous. Possession relation (I) is prototypical, and part-whole re-
lation (II) can be derived lexically from a possessive te “hand” [1]. However,
other possessee nominals are not necessarily relational. In order to reduce
the cost of pragmatics, [7] apply the Qualia Structure [5] of the possessee
noun and type-shift even non-inherently relational NP2 into a relational
noun. For example, even though poem is not a relational noun, John’s poem
can be interpreted as the poem that John composed because the internal
semantic structure of poem contains an author-of relation as AGENTIVE
role. The meaning shifting operator QA raises a one-place holder poem in
(3a) into a two-place holder in (3b). The type-shifted NP2 can now combine
with the possessive NP, which has a uniformly type ((e,et),(et,t)) so that
the authorship relation is inherited from NP2 poem, and R is no longer a
free variable.

However, even [7]&apos;s method is not sufficient to systematically compute
the meaning of the Japanese `NP1-no NP2&apos; construction. For example, in
terms of location (III), tomodachi “friend” and shinseki “relative” in Tokyo-
no tomodachi “a friend in Tokyo” and Kyoto-no shinseki “Kyoto relative”
are relational nouns, i.e., friend-of x/relative-of x, but the relation between
NP1 and NP2 is not friend-of or relative of but of location, namely, NP2 is
in NP1. We also encounter a problem with boshi-no fujin “the lady with a
hat.&amp;quot; Since wearing a hat is not part of the qualia roles, that are AGENTIVE
(origin), TELIC (purpose), CONSTITUTIVE (part-whole) and FORMAL
(isa) roles, of the non-inherently relational noun fujin“lady,&amp;quot; even Vikner
and Jensen’s system is unable to supply the binder for R.

4 Enriching the Qualia Structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.926279869565218">
In order to reduce the weight of pragmatics, I propose encoding more in-
formation into the lexicon elaborating the qualia structure. Specifically, I
suggest adding two qualia into the already existing four qualia roles:
- CONSTITUTIVE = SIZE, WEIGHT, HAVE, COLOR
- TELIC = TRADE
- SPATIO-TEMPO = IN, AT
- ACTIVITY = MAKE ACT, DRINK ACT
HAVE, which is a two-place predicate with possessor and possessee ar-
guments, is added to subcategories of the extended CONST quole. LO-
CATION and TIME are subcategories of the new SPATIO-TEMPO role.
These are added to the qualia roles of nominals because all physical objects
usually occupy some space and time [6]. In addition to WEIGHT, which
is included into the CONST quale in [5], we add SIZE, which is related to
dimensionality, and COLOR. TRADE is incorporated into the TELIC role.
SIZE and COLOR are part of the CONST role of clothing artifacts such
as boshi “hat&amp;quot;; therefore, aka-no boshi “the red hat” can be computed com-
positionally. The TIME, the LOCATION and the HAVE roles of location
terms such as koen “park” are used to interpret haru-no koen meaning “the
park in spring,” chicaku-no koen meaning “a nearby park,” and tsutsuji-
no koen meaning “a park with azaleas,” respectively. TRADE role in the
TELIC of proper nouns is observed in Supa-no Maruetsu “Maruetsu Su-
permarket&amp;quot; and Kaban-no Sanpei “Sanpei for bags.” Such expanded qualia
roles can substitute R through type-shifting NP2.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999174">
Japanese genitive postpositions cannot be disambiguated in terms of the
existing qualia of the possessee nominals. We need to enrich the lexical
input by expanding the subcategories of FORMAL and CONSTITUTIVE
roles, and by supplementing them with new roles – SPATIO-TEMPO and
ACTIVITY. As [7] did not propose any method for restricting the quale to be
used for type-shifting, the present analysis does not provide any suggestions
for identifying the quale to be used for the interpretation of the possessive
noun phrases. However, it provides the enriched lexical entry which enables
access to the sense of NP2 and determines the semantic relation expressed
by Japanese genitive postpositions.

My proposal is based on the Japanese genitive postposition no. The Japanese “NP1-no NP2&amp;quot; construction expresses a wider range of relations between two entities than does the English possessive “NP1&apos;s NP2,&amp;quot; such that the Pustejovskian qualia roles encoded in NP2 do not supply the necessary relations between two entities, which [7] succeeded to certain degree. Possessive relation disambiguation requires enriching lexical entries by incorporating the HAVE relation into the CONSTITUTIVE role and listing other qualia such as the ACTIVITY and the SPATIO-TEMPORAL role with the subcategories of LOCATION and TIME. 2 Various Relations and Argument Reversal The Japanese genitive marker is semantically very ambiguous. `NP1-GEN NP2&apos; expresses not only possession as in John’s pen and a part-whole relation as in John’s leg, but also location, accompaniment, property, quantity, etc., as shown in Table 1.

The possessor argument is NP1 in (I), as in English Tanaka&apos;s bag whose possessor argument is Tanaka. On the contrary in (V), the possessor of the bag is NP2 hito “man&amp;quot; and there is no English equivalent big bag’s person. In (VI) Kaban-no Sanpei “Bags Sanpei,&amp;quot; Sanpei is a bag store, and therefore the possessor of a bag. The controller-controllee relation is also reversed, for example, in Tanaka-no kuruma “Tanaka&apos;s car” (type I), Tanaka is the controller of the car, i.e., NP2 the car is at Tanaka&apos;s disposal as in English the girl’s car [7]. On the contrary, in boshi-no fujin “the lady with a hat,&amp;quot; NP1 boshi is at the person’s disposal. Aoi-me-no ningyo “the doll with blue eyes,” literally, “blue eyes’ doll” in (VIII) even expresses the part-whole relation in the reverse direction, compared with ningyo-no me “the doll’s eyes.” Such non-canonical relations, i.e., other than those expressing possession or a part-whole relation, are more likely expressed in noun compounds such as magic land or prepositional phrases using of, in, or with in English. 3 Problems with Deriving Various Possessive Relations from NP2 Possessive relations </context>

Possession relation (I) is prototypical, and part-whole relation (II) can be derived lexically from a possessive te “hand” [1]. However, other possessee nominals are not necessarily relational. In order to reduce the cost of pragmatics, [7] apply the Qualia Structure [5] of the possessee noun and type-shift even non-inherently relational NP2 into a relational noun. For example, even though poem is not a relational noun, John’s poem can be interpreted as the poem that John composed because the internal semantic structure of poem contains an author-of relation as AGENTIVE role. The meaning shifting operator QA raises a one-place holder poem in (3a) into a two-place holder in (3b). The type-shifted NP2 can now combine with the possessive NP, which has a uniformly type ((e,et),(et,t)) so that the authorship relation is inherited fro</context>
