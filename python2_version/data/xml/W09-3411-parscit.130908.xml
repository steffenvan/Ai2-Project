Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999717653846154">
Acquisition of verb subcategorization frames
is important as verbs generally take different
types of relevant arguments associated with
each phrase in a sentence in comparison to
other parts of speech categories. This paper
presents the acquisition of different subcate-
gorization frames for a Bengali verb Kara
(do). It generates compound verbs in Bengali
when combined with various noun phrases.
The main hypothesis here is that the subcate-
gorization frames for a Bengali verb are same
with the subcategorization frames for its
equivalent English verb with an identical
sense tag. Syntax plays the main role in the
acquisition of Bengali verb subcategorization
frames. The output frames of the Bengali
verbs have been compared with the frames of
the equivalent English verbs identified using
a Bengali-English bilingual lexicon. The
flexible ordering of different phrases, addi-
tional attachment of optional phrases in Ben-
gali sentences make this frames acquisition
task challenging. This system has demon-
strated precision and recall values of 77.11%
and 88.23% respectively on a test set of 100
sentences.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999984442307693">
A subcategorization frame is a statement of what
types of syntactic arguments a verb (or an adjec-
tive) takes, such as objects, infinitives, that-
clauses, participial clauses, and subcategorized
prepositional phrases (Manning,1993). The verb
phrase in a sentence usually takes various types
of subcategorization frames compared to phrases
of other types and hence the acquisition of such
frames for verbs are really challenging.
A subcategorization dictionary obtained auto-
matically from corpora can be updated quickly
and easily as different usages develop. Several
large, manually developed subcategorization
lexicons are available for English, e.g. the
COMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al., 1994), AC-
QUILEX (Copestake, 1992) and the ANLT
(Briscoe et al., 1987) dictionaries. VerbNet (VN)
(Kipper-Schuler, 2005) is the largest online verb
lexicon with explicitly stated syntactic and se-
mantic information based on Levin’s verb classi-
fication (Levin, 1993). It is a hierarchical do-
main-independent, broad-coverage verb lexicon
with mappings to other lexical resources such as
WordNet (Miller, 1990), XTAG (XTAG Re-
search Group, 2001) and FrameNet (Baker et al.,
1998). But, there is no existing subcategorization
lexicon available for Bengali language. The sub-
categorization of verbs is an essential issue in
parsing for the free phrase order languages such
as Bengali. As there is no such existing parser
available in Bengali, the acquisition as well as
evaluation of the acquired subcategorization
frames are difficult but crucial tasks. The main
difference between English and Bengali sentence
is the variation in the ordering of various
phrases. The pivotal hypothesis here is that the
subcategorization frames obtained for a Bengali
verb are same with the subcategorization frames
that may be acquired for its equivalent verb with
an identical sense tag in English.
The present work deals with the acquisition of
verb subcategorization frames of a verb kara
(do) from a Bengali newspaper corpus. This verb
generates various types of compound verbs in
combination with other preceding noun phrases
in Bengali. The sentences containing these types
of compound verb entries have been retrieved
from the Bengali corpus. The Bengali verb sub-
categorization frame acquisition task has been
carried out for the ten most frequent compound
verbs that contain kara (do) as a component. The
number of occurrences of other compound verbs

is negligible in the corpus. So, for evaluation
purpose, we have not considered those verbs.
Each of the ten Bengali compound verbs has
been searched in the Bengali-English bilingual
lexicon1 and the equivalent English verb mean-
ings with its synonyms have been identified and
retrieved. All possible subcategorization frames
for each of the English synonyms of the Bengali
verb have been acquired from the English
VerbNet2. These frames have been mapped to the
Bengali sentences that contain the compound
verb. Evaluation results with a test set of 100
sentences show the effectiveness of the model
with precision, recall and F-Measure values of
77.11%, 88.23% and 79.24% respectively. There
are some frames that have not been identified
due to their absence in the corpus. Linguists have
suggested that these frames do appear in Bengali
and hence can be acquired.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 gives the description of the related
works carried out in this area. Section 3 de-
scribes the framework for the acquisition of sub-
categorization frames for ten compound Bengali
verbs. Evaluation results of the system are dis-
cussed in section 4. Finally section 5 concludes
the paper.

One of the early works for identifying verbs that
resulted in extremely low yields for subcategori-
zation frame acquisition is described in (Brent,
1991). A rule based system for automatically
acquiring six verb subcategorization frames and
their frequencies from a large corpus is men-
tioned in (Ushioda et al., 1993). An open class
vocabulary of 35,000 words was analyzed manu-
ally in (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) for subcatego-
rization frames and predicate associations. The
result was compared against associations in
ANLT and COMLEX. Variations of subcatego-
rization frequencies across corpus type (written
vs. spoken) have been studied in (Carroll and
Rooth, 1998). A mechanism for resolving verb
class ambiguities using subcategorization frames
is reported in (Lapata and Brew, 1999). All these
works deal with English. Several works on the
term classification of verb diathesis roles or the
lexical semantics of predicates in natural lan-
guage have been reported in ((McCarthy, 2001),

A cross lingual work on learning verb-

We have used a Bengali news corpus (Ekbal and
Bandyopadhyay, 2008) developed from the web-
archives of a widely read Bengali newspaper. A
portion of the Bengali news corpus containing
1500 sentences have been POS tagged using a
Maximum Entropy based POS tagger (Ekbal et
al., 2008). The POS tagger was developed with a
tagset of 26 POS tags3, defined for the Indian
languages. The POS tagger demonstrated an ac-
curacy of 88.2%. We have also developed a rule-
based chunker to chunk the POS tagged data
with an overall accuracy of 89.4%.

Our previous work (Das et.al., 2009) on the ac-
quisition of Bengali subcategorization frames
from the same Bengali news corpus was carried
out for the most frequent verb “ f9V” (dekha)
(see) in that corpus. The next highest frequent
verb in this corpus is “WO.” (kara) (do) which is
a special verb in Bengali. However to the best of
our knowledge, no frame acquisition task has
been carried out yet for this Bengali verb. The
single occurrence of “WO.” (kara) as a main verb
in a sentence takes completely different subcate-
gorization frames in comparison with the ac-
quired frames for the compound verbs consisting
of “WO.” (kara) as a component. Hence, we have

concentrated our focus to acquire subcategoriza-
tion frames for the Bengali verb “করা&apos; (kara).
For this purpose, we have manually analyzed
the tagged and chunked data to identify the word
“করা&apos; (kara) that are tagged as main verb (VM)
and belong to the verb group chunk (VG) in the
corpus. The preceding noun phrase of “করা&apos;
(kara) generally produces completely different
verbs in Bengali (e.g. [Ļতির করা (tairi(NN)
kara(VM))(make)], [বƟবহার করা (byabahar (NN)
kara(VM))(use)] etc.).
Bengali, like any other Indian languages, is
morphologically very rich. Different suffixes
may be attached to a verb depending on the vari-
ous features such as Tense, Aspect, and Person.
The Bengali stemmer uses a suffix list to identify
the stem form of the verb “করা&apos; (kara). Another
table stores the stem form and the corresponding
root form. Stemming process has correctly iden-
tified 234 occurrences of the verb “করা&apos; (kara)
from its 241 occurrences in the corpus with an
accuracy of 97.09%. The sentences where the
verb “করা&apos; (kara) appears in any inflected form
but has been tagged as main verb (VM) have
been retrieved. These sentences have been con-
sidered for fine-grained analysis of verb subcate-
gorization frames. It is expected that the corpus
will have adequate number of occurrences for
each subcategorization frame of the verb. The
passive occurrences of “করা&apos; (kara) such as
“করােনা&apos; (karano), কিরেয় (kariye) have been fil-
tered out and the sentences containing the pas-
sive entries of “করা&apos; have not been considered in
the present work.
The compound verb phrases with pattern such
as {[XXX] (NN) [kara] (VM)} have been identi-
fied and retrieved from the Bengali POS tagged
and chunked corpus. It has been observed that
most of these compound verb phrases are indi-
vidually different verbs in Bengali. Around 182
various kinds of verbs have been identified. Cer-
tain typical and distinct occurrences of “করা&apos;
(kara) have also been identified. But, linguistic
verification shows that these typical verbs are
formed by attaching the verb “করা&apos; (kara) to an
adjective or an adverb word, like ঝকঝক করা
(jhakjhak kara) , তকতক করা (taktak kara), শীত
করা (sheet kara) etc. Such types of around 48
verb entries have been identified and filtered out
from the corpus. The rest 134 distinct types of
Bengali compound verbs (CV) with “করা&apos; (kara)
as a component have been considered as target
verbs for analysis.
We have identified the frequencies of these
verbs in the corpus. It has to be mentioned that
only a few verbs have an adequate number of
sentences in the corpus. For this reason, only the
top ten compound verbs that have the largest
number of occurrences in the corpus have been
selected. Table 1 represents the top 10 different
Bengali compound verbs and their frequencies
obtained from the corpus.

The verb subcategorization frames for the
equivalent English verbs (in the same sense) of a
Bengali verb are the initial set of verb subcatego-
rization frames that have been considered as
valid for that Bengali verb. The root forms of the
target verbs appearing in different inflected
forms in the Bengali corpus have been identified
by the process described in section 3.2. The de-
termination of equivalent English verbs has been
carried out using a Bengali-English bilingual
lexicon. We have used the available Bengali-
English bilingual dictionary that has been for-
matted for the text processing tasks. Various syn-
tactical representations of a word entry in the
lexicon have been analyzed to identify its syno-
nyms and meanings. The example of an entry in
the bilingual lexicon for our target verb “করা&apos;
(kara) is given as follows.
&lt;করা [karā] v to do, to per-
form, to accomplish, to exe-
cute (কাজ করা); to build, to
make (Ļতির করা) ; &gt;
But, the various distinct verbs, with “করা&apos;
(kara) as a component have individual separate
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.995731033333333">
entries in the bilingual dictionary. We have iden-
tified the equivalent English verbs from those
Bengali verb entries in the dictionary. For exam-
ple,
&lt;Ļতির করা v. to build, to
make; ...&gt;
&lt;বƟবহার করা v. to apply, to
use; to behave; to treat (a
person), to behave towards;
...&gt;
&lt;কাজ করা v. to work; to
serve; to be effective ;...&gt;
Different synonyms for a verb having the
same sense are separated using “,” and different
senses are separated using “;” in the lexicon. The
synonyms including different senses of the target
verb have been extracted from the lexicon. This
yields a resulting set called Synonymous Verb
Set (SVS). For example, the English synonyms
(apply, use) and synonym with another sense
(behave) have been selected for Bengali verb
“বƟবহার করা” (byabahar kara) and have been
categorized as two different SVS for the Bengali
verb “বƟবহার করা”. Two synonyms (make, build)
for the Bengali verb “Ļতির করা” (tairi kara) are
thus present in the same SVS. Now, the task is to
acquire all the possible existing frames for each
member of the SVS from the VerbNet. The
“করা” (kara) verb may also appear in passive
form in Bengali sentences. For example,

The corresponding dictionary entry for the
passive form of “করা” (kara) is as follows. But in
this work, we have concentrated only on those
sentences where “করা” (kara) appears in active
form.
&lt;করােনা [karānō] v to cause to

or execute or build or

VerbNet associates the semantics of a verb with
its syntactic frames and combines traditional
lexical semantic information such as thematic
roles and semantic predicates, with syntactic
frames and selectional restrictions. Verb entries
in the same VerbNet class share common syntac-
tic frames, and thus they are believed to have the
same syntactic behavior. The VerbNet files con-
taining the verbs with their possible subcategori-
zation frames and membership information is
stored in XML file format. The Bengali verb Ļতির
করা (tairi kora) (make) has no direct class in
VerbNet. The verb “make” and its synonymous
verb “build” are members of one of the sub-
classes of the build-26.1 class and “make” is also
a member of the dub-29.3 class. A snapshot of
XML file for the build-26.1 class is given below.

formation. This preprocessed list is searched to
acquire the subcategorization frames for each

(identified in section 3.3). As the verbs are clas-
sified according to their semantics in the
VerbNet, the frames for the particular Bengali
verb are assumed to be similar to the frames ob-

The acquired VerbNet frames have been mapped
to the Bengali verb subcategorization frames by
considering the position of the verb as well as its
general co-existing nature with other phrases in
Bengali sentences.
The syntax of “NP-PP” frame for a Bengali
sentence has been acquired by identifying the
target verb followed by a NP chunk and a PREP
chunk. The sentences containing prepositional
frame “PP” do not appear in the Bengali corpus,
as there is no concept of preposition in Bengali.
But, when we compare the sentences containing
postpositional markers, i.e. PREP (postpositions)
as a probable argument of the verb, the system
gives the desired output.

The NNPC (Compound proper noun), NNP

sentences the occurrence of these POS tags pre-
ceded by the PRP (Pronoun) or NNPC tags and

The presence of JJ (Adjective) generally does
not play any role in the acquisition process of
verb subcategorization frames. There are some
frames that did not have any instance in our cor-
pus. Such frames are “Asset-PP”, “After-PP”,
“Location Subject Alternation” and “NP-TO-
INF-VC” etc. A close linguistic analysis shows
that these frames can also be acquired from the
Bengali sentences. They have not occurred in the
corpus that has been considered for the analysis
in the present work.

<bodyText confidence="0.99998855882353">
The set of acquired subcategorization frames or
the frame lexicon can be evaluated against a gold
standard corpus obtained either through manual
analysis of corpus data or from subcategorization
frame entries in a large dictionary or from the
output of the parser made for that language. As
there is no parser available for the Bengali and
also no existing dictionary for Bengali that con-
tains subcategorization frames, manual analysis
from corpus data is the only method for evalua-
tion. The chunked sentences that contain the ten
most frequent verbs have been evaluated manu-
ally to prepare the gold standard data.
We have identified 45 different kinds of verbs
in the corpus. A detailed statistics of the verb
“করা” (kara) is presented in Table 3. During the
Bengali verb subcategorization frame acquisition
process, it has been observed that the simple sen-
tences contain most of the frames that the Eng-
lish verb form usually takes in VerbNet. Analysis
of a simple Bengali sentence to identify the verb
subcategorization frames is easier in the absence
of a parser than analyzing complex and com-
pound sentences. There are only three occur-
rences of “করা” (kara) as auxiliary in the corpus.
These are chunking errors as the verb “করা”
(kara) does not occur as auxiliary verb.
The verb subcategorization frames acquisition
process is evaluated using type precision (the
percentage of subcategorization frame types that
the system proposes are correct according to the
gold standard), type recall (the percentage of
subcategorization frame types in the gold stan-
dard that the system proposes) and F-measure:

The system has been evaluated with 100 gold
standard test sentences containing ten most fre-
quent verbs and the evaluation results are shown
in Table 4. The recall of the system shows a sat-
isfactory performance in producing Bengali verb
subcategorization frames but the precision value
requires more improvement.

It has been noticed that the absence of other
frames in the Bengali corpus is due to the free
phrase ordering characteristics of Bengali Lan-
guage. The proper alignment of the phrases is
needed to cope up with this language specific
problem. The number of different frames ac-
quired for these ten verbs is shown in Table 5.

The acquisition of subcategorization frames for
more number of verbs and clustering them will
help us to build a verb lexicon for Bengali lan-
guage. We need to find out Bengali verb sub-
categorization frames that may not be supported
for the corresponding English verb with identical
sense.

There is no restriction for domain dependency
in this system. For the free-phrase-order lan-
guages like Bengali, the overall performance can
be increased by proper assumptions, rules and
implementation procedures. Verb morphological
information, synonymous sets and their possible
subcategorization frames are all important in-
formation to develop a full-fledged parser for
Bengali. This system can be used for solving
alignment problems in Machine Translation for
Bengali as well as to identify possible argument
selection for Question and Answering systems.

<abstract confidence="0.997516518518519">Acquisition of verb subcategorization frames is important as verbs generally take different types of relevant arguments associated with each phrase in a sentence in comparison to other parts of speech categories. This paper presents the acquisition of different subcateframes for a Bengali verb It generates compound verbs in Bengali when combined with various noun phrases. The main hypothesis here is that the subcategorization frames for a Bengali verb are same with the subcategorization frames for its equivalent English verb with an identical sense tag. Syntax plays the main role in the acquisition of Bengali verb subcategorization frames. The output frames of the Bengali verbs have been compared with the frames of the equivalent English verbs identified using a Bengali-English bilingual lexicon. The flexible ordering of different phrases, additional attachment of optional phrases in Bengali sentences make this frames acquisition task challenging. This system has demonstrated precision and recall values of 77.11% and 88.23% respectively on a test set of 100 sentences.</abstract>

Section 3 describes the framework for the acquisition of subcategorization frames for ten compound Bengali verbs. Evaluation results of the system are discussed in section 4. Finally section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Related Work One of the early works for identifying verbs that resulted in extremely low yields for subcategorization frame acquisition is described in (Brent, 1991). A rule based system for automatically acquiring six verb subcategorization frames and their frequencies from a large corpus is mentioned in (Ushioda et al., 1993). An open class vocabulary of 35,000 words was analyzed manually in (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) for subcategorization frames and predicate associations. The result was compared against associations in ANLT and COMLEX. Variations of subcategorization frequencies across corpus type (written vs. spoken) have been studied in (Carroll and Rooth, 1998).

Several large, manually developed subcategorization lexicons are available for English, e.g. the COMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al., 1994), ACQUILEX (Copestake, 1992) and the ANLT (Briscoe et al., 1987) dictionaries. VerbNet (VN) (Kipper-Schuler, 2005) is the largest online verb lexicon with explicitly stated syntactic and semantic information based on Levin’s verb classification (Levin, 1993). It is a hierarchical domain-independent, broad-coverage verb lexicon with mappings to other lexical resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1990), XTAG (XTAG Research Group, 2001) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). But, there is no existing subcategorization lexicon available for Bengali language. The subcategorization of verbs is an essential issue in parsing for the free phrase order languages such as Bengali. As there is no such existing parser available in Bengali, the acquisition as well as evaluation of the acquired subcategorization frames are difficult but crucial tasks. The main difference between English and Bengali sentence is the variation in the ordering of various phrases. The pivotal hypothesis here is that the subcatego</context>

A rule based system for automatically acquiring six verb subcategorization frames and their frequencies from a large corpus is mentioned in (Ushioda et al., 1993). An open class vocabulary of 35,000 words was analyzed manually in (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) for subcategorization frames and predicate associations. The result was compared against associations in ANLT and COMLEX. Variations of subcategorization frequencies across corpus type (written vs. spoken) have been studied in (Carroll and Rooth, 1998). A mechanism for resolving verb class ambiguities using subcategorization frames is reported in (Lapata and Brew, 1999). All these works deal with English. Several works on the term classification of verb diathesis roles or the lexical semantics of predicates in natural language have been reported in ((McCarthy, 2001), 1 http://home.uchicago.edu/~cbs2/banglainstruction.html 2 http://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/verbnet.html (Korhonen, 2002), (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999) and (Walde, 1998)).
