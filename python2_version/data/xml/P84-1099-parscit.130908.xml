In the context of transferbased MT systems,
the nature of the intermediate represenations,
and particularly their &apos;depth&apos;, is an important
question. This paper explores the notions of
&apos;independence of languages&apos; and &apos;simple trans-
fer&apos;, and provides some principles that may
enable linguists to study this problem in a
systematic way.

1. Background
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999832615384616">
This paper is relevant for a class of MT
systems with the following characteristics:
The translation process is broken down into
three stages: source text analysis, transfer,
and target text synthesis.
The text that serves as unit of translation
is at least a sentence.
The system is multilingual, at least in principle.
These characteristics are not uncommon; however,
Eurotra may be the only project in the world
that applies (iii) not only as a matter of
principle but as actual practice.
We will regard a natural language as a set of
texts. A translation pair is a pair of texts
(Ts, Tt) from the source and target language,
respectively. One sometimes wonders whether
for every Is there is at least one translation
Tk, but we will ignore that kind of issue
here.
For translation systems of the analysis-
transfer-synthesis family, the following
diagram is a useful description:

<bodyText confidence="0.99966025">
TRA, AN, TRF, and GEN are all binary relations.
Given the sets of texts SL (source language)
and TL (target language), and the set of
representations RR, we can say:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.972473">
TRA SL x TL, AN G SL x RR
TRF c- RR x RR, and GEN c. RR x TL
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99846348">
The subsystems analysis, transfer, and
synthesis are implementations of AN, TRF, and
GEN. In this paper, we are not interested in
the implementations, but in the relations to be
implemented.
Especially, we try to find a principled basis
for the study of the represenations R and R . â€¢
Such a basis can only be established in the
context of some fundamental philosophy of the
translation system. We will assume the follo-
wing two basic ideas:
Simple transfer:
Transfer should be kept as simple as possible.
Independence of languages:
The construction of analysis and synthesis for
each of the languages should be entirely
independent of knowledge about the other
languages covered.
These two ideas are certainly not trivial, and
especially (ii) may be a bit exceptional
compared to other MT projects; however, they
are quite reasonable given a project that
really tries to develop a multilingual trans-
lation system. In any case, they are both
held in the Eurotra project.

<bodyText confidence="0.939502909090909">
The reason for (i) is simply the number of trans-
fer systems that must be developed for k langua-
ges, which is
k(k-1).
From this, it follows that &apos;simple&apos; here means
&apos;simple to construct&apos;, not &apos;simple to execute&apos;.
The reason for principle (ii) also follows for
multilinguality; while developing analysis and
synthesis for some language, one may be able
to take into account two or three other
languages, but this does not hold in a case
like Eurotra, where one not only has seven
languages to deal with, but also the possibility
of adding languages must be kept open.
Principles (i) and (ii) together constitute
a philosophy that can serve as a basis for the
development of a theory about the nature of the
representations R and Rt in (1). The remainder
of this paper is evoted to a clearer and more
useful formulation of them.
2. Division of labour.
Suppose that simple transfer is taken to
mean that transfer will only substitute lexical
elements, and that the theory of representation
says that the representations are something
in the way of syntactic structures. We now
have a problem in cases where translation
pairs consist of texts with different syntactic
structures. Two well-known examples are:
(i) the graag-like case;
Example: Dutch &apos;Tom zwemt graag&apos; translates
as English &apos;Tom likes to swim&apos;, with syntactic
structures:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.980176333333333">
(2) Dutch:
GTom Eve zwem graag 3))
(3) English:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.88509175">
rs Tom Ey( like[ r empty rwswim.11137)
In the case of Dutch-English transfer, lexical
substitution would result in an Rt like the
following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.883216">
(4) Possible R :
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988005411764706">
Tom[ swimtAjut like-tolT]
vf
In this way, the pair 4(4), &apos;Tom likes to swim&apos;)&apos;
becomes a member of the relation GEN for
English. However, it is hard to believe that
English linguists will be able to accomodate
such pairs without knowing a lot about the
other languages that belong to the project.
(ii) The kenner - somebody who knows case
Dutch and English both have agentive derivation,
like
talk -4 talker, swim =&gt; swimmer.
However, as usually, derivational processes are
not entirely regular, and so, for example though
Dutch has &apos;kenner&apos;, English does not have the
corresponding &apos;knower&apos;. So we have the follo-
wing translation pair:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.911777">
(5) Dutch: &apos;kenner van het Turks&apos;
English: &apos;somebody who knows Turkish&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.966089882352942">
Again, the English generation writer is
in trouble if he has to know that the Rt
may contain a construction like
&apos;1know3+era, because this implies
knowledge about all the other languages
that participate.
The general idea is that we want to have
a strictly monolingual basis for the
development of the implementations of AN and
GEN. Therefore, so, we have the following
principle:
(6) Division of labour (simple version):
For each language L in the system,
4R,T74EGENL iff(T,R7EANL
Principle (6) makes AN and GEN each others
&apos;mirror image&apos;, and so it becomes more probable
(though it is not guaranteed) that the
linguists knowing L will understand the class
of Rs they can expect.
However, (6) is too strong, and may be in
conflict with the idea of simple transfer.
For example, if surface syntactic structure
is taken as a theory of representation, then
(6) implies that TRF relates source language
surface word order to target language word
order, which clearly involves a lot more than
substitution of lexical elements.
Therefore, the notion of isoduidy has been
developed. Isoduidy is an equivalence relation
between representations that belong to the
same language. Literally, the word &apos;isoduid&apos;
(from Greek and Dutch stems) means &apos;same
interpretation&apos;; but the meaning should be
generalized to something like &apos;equivalent
with respect to the essence of translation&apos;.
To give an example, suppose that representations
are surface trees with various labelings,
Including semantic ones like thematic
relations and semantic markers. Isoduay might
then be defined loosely as follows:
two representations are isoduid if they have
the same vertical geometry, and the same lexical
elements and semantic labels in the correspon-
ding positions.
Obviously, the definition of the contents of the
isoduidy relation depends on the contents of
the representation theory. However, we think
that the general idea must be clear: isoduidy
defines in some general way which aspects of
representations are taken to be essential for
translation.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99925">

<bodyText confidence="0.997792818181818">
Given isoduidy, one can give a more sophisti-
cated version of the principle of division of
labour as follows:
(7) Division of labour (final version):
For each language L in the system,
(111,T7 e GEN&apos;.
iff
LT,R7 CAA. and R&apos; is isoduid to R
As a consequence, TRF has not to take responsibili-
ty for target language specific aspects like word
order anymore.

3. Simple and complex transfer.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.827727666666667">
Given the principle of division of labour, we
can relate to each other the following three
things:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7620945">
- the notion of simple transfer
- the representation theory, especially, the
&apos;depth&apos; of representation;
- the contents of the relation isoduidy
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.976393243589744">
Given some definition of what counts as simple
transfer, we can now see whether the represen-
tation theory is compatible with it.
It is easy to see that some popular theories
of simple transfer, including the one saying
that transfer is just substitution of lexical
elements, will now give rise to a rather &apos;deep&apos;
theory of representation. This follows from
cases like &apos;graag-like&apos; and &apos;kenner-knower&apos;,
where some language happens to lack lexical
elements that others happen to have. In such
cases, the language lacking the element usually
circumscribes the meaning in some way. If one
excludes transfer other than lexical substitu-
tion, such examples give rise to a theory of
representation where similar circumscriptions
must be assigned as representations in the
language that does have the lexical element. So,
in Dutch we get pairs in AN like
kenner&apos; , L somebody who knows33
.&apos;Tom zwemt graag&apos;, Tom graag C empty
zwem3 3
Instead of having deep representations like
these, one may consider the possibility that
transfer is complicated sometimes. So, one may
still desire that transfer consists of just lexi-
cal substitution most of the time, but allow
exceptions. The question then arises as to how
simple and complex transfer interact.
As a basis for that, one may observe that the
relation TRF now holds between representations,
while in practice just lexical elements are
translated most of the time. A straightfoward
generalization is possible for the case where
a representation is some hierarchical object,
say some tree. We can then introduce a new
relation, called translates-as. This is a
binary relation, probably many-to-many; its
left-hand term is a subtree of R , and its
righthand term is a tree. Clearly, TRF is a
subset of translates-as.
We then have the following principle:
(8) Transfer translates a tree node-by-node.
Note that, obviously, this only makes
sense as long as we have representations
that are treeS.The following example may
clarify the idea. Dotted lines indicate
instantiations of the relation.
(empty) (swim(
Note that Dutch &apos;graag&apos; is not translated at all;
it only serves as a basis for the complex
transfer element4C,I7.
The principle of simple transfer can now be
formulated as follows:
If A translates-as A&apos;, then we will call A&apos;
a TN of A. We now call an element s,t
of the set defined by translates-as a simple
iff.
either
s and t are both terminal nodes,
or
s is a subtree, dominated by the nonterminal
node A, and
(ii) t is a tree, dominated by A&apos;, and
(iii) A&apos; is a copy of A&apos;, and
(iv) the immediate daughters of A&apos; are copies
of the TNs of the immediate daughters of A.
The principle of simple transfer then says that
the proportion of simple elements in translates-
as must be maximal.
The generalised relation translates-as makes
it possible to put some order into complex
transfer. It localises it in a natural way,
based on a tree structure.
In (9), only the pair 4C, 12 is complex;
all the others are simple. This view on transfer
is easily implemented by means of an inbuilt
strategy that simulates recursion.
