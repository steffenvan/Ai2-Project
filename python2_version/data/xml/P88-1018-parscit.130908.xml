The inquiry semantics approach of the Nigel compu-
tational systemic grammar of English has proved capa-
ble of revealing distinctions within propositional con-
tent that the text planning process needs to control in
order for adequate text to be generated. An extension
to the chooser and inquiry framework motivated by a
Japanese clause generator capable of expressing levels
of politeness makes this facility available for revealing
the distinctions necessary among interpersonal, social
meanings also. This paper shows why the previous
inquiry framework was incapable of the kind of se-
mantic control Japanese politeness requires and how
the implemented extension achieves that control. An
example is given of the generation of a sentence that
is appropriately polite for its context of use and some
implications for future work are suggested.

A crucial task in text generation is to be able to con-
trol linguistic resources so as to make what is gen-
erated conform to what is to be expressed. In the
computational systemic-functional grammar (SFG)
&apos;Nigel&apos; (Mann, 1985; Matthiessen, 1985; Mann and
Matthiessen, 1985), this task is the responsibility of
the grammar&apos;s inquiry semantics. Nigel follows gen-
eral systemic-functional linguistics (SFL) practice in
presenting grammar as a resource for expressing mean-
ings; meanings are realized by a network of interlock-
ing options and particular grammatical forms are ar-
rived at by making choices in this network. Gener-
ating appropriate text is then a problem of making
the choices in such a way that the distinct needs of
individual texts to be expressed are satisfied. This is

search fellowship from the Japan Society for the Promotion
of Science (Tokyo) and the Royal Society (London), and

Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyoto University.
achieved by means of choice experts, or choosers, that
collectively ensure that the choices made will be those
appropriate for any particular text need. Each choice
point in the grammar network has associated with it a
chooser whose responsibility is to interrogate the text
need in respect of just those aspects of meaning nec-
essary for determining the appropriate option to take.
These choosers are formalized as decision trees whose
nodes consist of basic knowledge base interrogation
primitives called inquiries.
Each aspect of meaning to be expressed that the
grammar needs to know about is made accessible to
the choosers by means of a single inquiry whose func-
tion is to determine where any particular meaning to
be expressed stands on that aspect. For example,
should the grammar need to know whether the text
need was for the expression of a unitary object (say, a
lion) rather than a set object (lions), then at the appro-
priate choice points in the grammar choosers would ap-
peal to the inquiry named MultiplicityQ to determine
the text need. When fully specified, inquiries have two
forms, an informal English gloss representing the func-
tion of the inquiry in terms of the theory of meaning
adopted, and an implementation, currently in Lisp, of
an actual interrogation of a knowledge base. Typically,
constructing an inquiry proceeds first by means of suc-
cessive approximations in informal terms, glossed in
English, followed by an encoding of the understanding
achieved of the semantic distinction at issue.
This inquiry semantics approach has been very suc-
cessful in the Nigel grammar of English; the grammar
now has a very wide coverage all under inquiry con-
trol. The type of coverage has, however, been limited
primarily to what in SFL terms is called the ideational
component of meaning (Halliday, 1985). This is the
component concerned with expressing our represen-
tation of the world in terms of propositional content
and logical organization. It is natural, therefore, that
the inquiry approach should be successful in this do-
main since this is typically the kind of information
that is stored in the knowledge base and so is read-
ily retrievable. Another SFL component of meaning,
however, is the interpersonal. This aspect concerns

the expression of social relationships, an area that will
become increasingly important as more natural inter-
actions between people and machines are attempted.
Although the Nigel grammar does contain a few in-
quiries that are termed interpersonal, there has not
been enough work here really to determine whether
the inquiry framework is going to provide the tools
necessary for capturing the kind of meaning this in-
volves.
If the inquiry framework can be used in this area
also, then we can use it to investigate the knowledge
base distinctions that will need to be represented in
order to control interpersonal grammatical resources.
This is a methodology that has already been applied
with great success to ideational meaning in the Nigel
project. There, projecting through the inquiry inter-
face from the grammar on to context has allowed for
the construction of a domain independent knowledge
organization hierarchy called the upper structure (e.g.
Moore and Arens, 1985). Since inquiries rely upon
specific semantic distinctions to control the grammat-
ical choices for which they are responsible, the for-
mulation of a chooser&apos;s inquiries amounts to a con-
straint on the organization and content of the knowl-
edge base and text planning that needs to be done
of the following form: if the linguistic distinction for
which the present chooser is responsible is to be avail-
able as a resource for the text planner to exploit, then
that text planner and the knowledge base have at least
to support the semantic distinctions identified by the
inquiries that constitute that chooser.
Thus, the semantic distinctions revealed to be nec-
essary for the implementation of the inquiries that con-
trol ideational choices have guided the construction of
the upper structure. To extend the kind of organiza-
tional resource the upper structure provides into the
interpersonal arena would therefore be very beneficial
for our understanding of what needs to be included in
the interpersonal area of the knowledge base and the
text planning process and so would promise to improve
the range and quality of the texts we can generate.
2 A new domain: The ex-
pression of politeness in
Japanese clauses
As part of a proposed text generation project in
Japanese at Kyoto University, some fragments of a
systemic-functional grammar of Japanese have been
constructed (Bateman, 1985; Bateman et al., 1987).
In Japanese discourse the grammatical expression of
various interpersonal relationships is quite common.
Gaining control of these resources was therefore an
ideal way to test further the applicability of the inquiry
semantics approach in a domain which was clearly not
ideationaL
The particular area of interpersonal meaning exam-
ined here is that concerned with the expression of ap-
propriate degrees of humility and respect in references
to one&apos;s own actions, to those of one&apos;s audience, and
to those of third parties. Although the general rule of
being humble about one&apos;s own actions and respectful
about those of others is complicated by a number of
factors, even this simplest case presents problems as
far as controlling the grammar is concerned. In this
section, I will briefly describe some of the forms in-
volved and, in the next, how these create problems for
the inquiry and chooser framework as used in NigeL
A variety of clause forms are regularly employed in
Japanese for the expression of interpersonal meanings
related to &apos;politeness&apos;. For example, the &apos;demotion&apos;
of the process information to a nominal-like form pre-
ceded by a normal nominal honorific prefix (e.g. o, as
in o-eisce &apos;honorable&apos; tea) supported by an auxiliary
verb such as suru, `to do&apos;, or naru, `to become&apos;, of-
ten explicitly expresses the relative social statuses of
the participants involved and the fact of those partici-
pants&apos; acknowledgment of those statuses. This we can
see in,

<listItem confidence="0.886907166666667">

o-VERB- ni naru respectful referral
becomes to action of other
o-VERB desu more distant respect
â€¢ be for action of other
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999401481481482">
Another type of form involves combinations of mor-
phemes that conventionally represent distinctive ways
of being polite. Here, there are a number of different
interpersonal speech act types that may be performed.
For example, both the expression of gratitude for fa-
vors received and the expression of the giving of favors
are virtually obligatory in normal discourse; this is
achieved by appending one of the many verbs express-
ing &apos;to give/receive&apos; to the process performed. These
verbs are highly sensitive to relative social positions
and the perspective taken on the action performed
(e.g. Kuno and Kaburaki, 1977; Inoue, 1979) and this
aspect of their meaning is carried over for the expres-
sion of favors done or perceived.&apos; Typical combina-
tions also express polite ways of seeking permission for
actions; one here modifies the action to be performed
by means of the morphemes for causation/allowing,
receiving a favor, wishing for, and thinking: a rough
literal gloss of this form would be along the lines of &apos;I
think I want to humbly receive from you your allowing
me to do X&apos;.
Thus, the following clause forms are also commonly
required in normal discourse:
&apos;Thus, for verbs corresponding to the English &apos;give&apos; and
&apos;receive&apos;, there are seven Japanese verbs in common usage
and these differ in most part according to the relative social
positions of the participants in the giving.

This by no means exhausts the range of forms that
are relevant to discussions of politeness, respect, and
humility in present-day Japanese, but it will be suf-
ficient as an indication of the kinds of structures and
meanings addressed within the present grammar.3 It
should also be noted that there are different &apos;dimen-
sions&apos; of politeness involved in the use of these forms;
for example the clause

<bodyText confidence="0.973131376470589">
well come favor to speaker tag
which means &apos;thanks for coming&apos; is in the familiar level
of speech form, i.e. it could only be used between
people who are on familiar terms. It is nevertheless
still necessary for the favor being done to be explic-
itly acknowledged; not expressing it would result in a
clause that would often be inappropriate. The present
grammar also treats the range of distinctions that arise
along this &apos;familiar&apos;/ &apos;polite&apos; levels of speech dimension
but this will not be of immediate concern here.
The differences in meaning that these alternative
politeness-related forms represent need to be made
available to a text generation system. This may be
done by offering a set of grammatical resources that
serves to express interpersonal knowledge about the
interactive situation. As has been the case in the sys-
temic grammar approach employed in Nigel generally,
it is desirable to factor the knowledge and meanings
to be expressed in terms of a structured set of alter-
natives that may be selected from straightforwardly;
for ideational meanings this is provided by the upper
structure. The internal organization of the systemic
grammar then takes care of the construction of lin-
guistic structures appropriate to those meanings. Now
we want to be able to do the same with the linguistic
structures described here. Information which will need
to be held in appropriately constructed speaker and
hearer models should be factored according to the in-
quiries that are necessary for driving the grammatical
distinctions concerned. A problem arises here, how-
ever, in that it is not possible to state within Nigel&apos;s
grammar and chooser framework that the alternative
grammatical forms available for the expression of po-

of meanings and forms devoted to aspects of politeness in
Japanese is given in Mizutani and Mizutani (1987).
3 Problems with the existing
formalization of chooser-
grammar interaction
The principle problem encountered with controlling
the deployment of structures such as those introduced
in the previous section by means of a chooser mecha-
nism is that, formerly, all chooser decisions have been
local. Each chooser determines which grammatical
feature is to be selected as appropriate for the con-
text of use from a single point of minimal grammat-
ical alternation. For example, the grammatical sys-
tem that presents the minimal grammatical alterna-
tion in Japanese between having a constituent express
a circumstance of location, and not having such a con-
stituent, has a chooser associated with it which inter-
rogates the knowledge base and text plan by means of
its inquiries in order to see which of the two alterna-
tives is applicable in the case at hand. If a location
is to be expressed a grammatical feature is selected
that entails the insertion of a constituent character-
ized functionally as a location; if there is no location
to be expressed than a feature which does not have
such an entailment is selected. This selection between
the alternative grammatical choices, or features, that
are offered by a single grammatical system is the only
influence that the chooser of that system is permitted
to have on the generation process. Thus, in the lo-
cation case, the effects of the chooser responsible for
insertion or not of a location constituent are entirely
local to the portion of the generation process delimited
by the location system of the grammar.
With the politeness forms we seem to be faced again
with a set of alternative meanings concerning level and
type of politeness to be expressed. However, the prob-
lem as far as the previously implemented view of the
possible effects of choosers is concerned is that these
alternatives correspond to no single points of grammat-
ical alternation. For example, if the process of reading
(yomu) is to be expressed but we want to make a se-
lection of politeness-related meaning between a simple
respectful reference to another&apos;s actions and a more
distanced, indirect and reserved respectful reference,
then the choice of appropriate forms for that process
is between
o- yomi ni naru
HONORIFIC reading CASE becoming
and
o- yorni desu
HONORIFIC reading COPULA-be
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996224">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988484848485">
Now, while the distinction in meaning may be cap-
tured by a simple scale of the &apos;directness&apos; of the sen-
tence that is appropriate for the particular interactive
situation in which it is to be used, there is no gram-
matical system in the grammar of Japanese that offers
a direct choice between these two clause structures.
The former structure is similar to the typical use of
the verb &apos;become&apos; as in z-ni naru, `to become X&apos;; the
latter is similar to clauses such as X desu, &apos;it is X&apos;.
They are not normally, e.g. in contexts not involving
this particular contrast of politeness, in grammatical
contrast.
The distinction is, then; in the use and meaning of
the structures rather than in their grammatical con-
struction. Indeed, such distinctions may often cross-
cut the distinctions that are made in the grammar;
this is simply to accept that the semantic and prag-
matic distinctions that a language draws need not be
matched one-for-one by corresponding minimal points
of grammatical alternation. The levels of coding are
distinct and incorporate distinct aspects of the mean-
ing and construction of the linguistic units involved.
It is not then possible to associate a &apos;politeness&apos;
chooser with a grammatical system as is done with
the choosers for ideational meanings because there is
no grammatical system of &apos;politeness&apos; to which it may
be attached. A simple choice between minimal alter-
natives of politeness can result in radically different
grammatical structures that differ by virtue of many
features. This means that politeness of this kind can-
not be made available as a controllable expressive re-
source for a text planner within the chooser framework
as it is implemented within the Nigel project.

4 An implemented solution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999674589285714">
In order to meet this problem and to allow full control
of politeness phenomena, the following extension was
implemented within the context of the computational
systemic grammar framework supported at Kyoto.
The chooser framework is maintained as a deci-
sion tree that selects between minimal points of se-
mantic alternation. However, it is no longer the case
that this needs to be held in a one-to-one correspon-
dence with the minimal alternations that the gram-
mar network represents. The possibility of distinct
patterns of organization at the two levels, as would
be claimed by systemic linguistics proper, is therefore
captured. Accordingly, any chooser is permitted to
make any number of selections of grammatical features
from anywhere in the grammatical network. Choosers
are thereby permitted to take on more of the organi-
zational work required during text planning.
This extension made it possible to construct a
chooser decision tree that interrogates the text need
concerning precisely those distinctions in meaning re-
quired to ascertain which level and form of politeness
to employ. The inquiries of this decision tree are free
to ask all the questions related to the aspects of the
social relationships of the participants in the speech
situation that are necessary without being concerned
about where in the grammatical network the conse-
quences of those questions will be felt. This makes
that reasoning available in a modular and easily com-
prehensible form. The result of any particular path
through the decision tree is a set of grammatical fea-
tures that the grammatical product being generated
as a whole must bear. This can therefore call for very
different structural results to be selected which differ
by many grammatical features drawn from many dis-
tinct grammatical points of alternation. The present
politeness &apos;chooser&apos;, or decision tree, has around 15
decision points where a distinct inquiry needs to be
put to the knowledge base. These inquiries are still at
the stage of informal approximation.
For example, after traversal of the decision tree has
already established a number of important facts con-
cerning the text need, including that the actor is the
hearer, that the situation is not one classifiable as for-
mally &apos;official&apos;, that there is considerable social &apos;dis-
tance&apos; between the speaker and hearer, among others,
the simple semantic distinction glossable in English as
Is the subject-matter of the process such
that additional reserve should be shown?
is drawn. If the text need is classifiable as requir-
ing a yes-response to this inquiry then the gram-
matical features: identifying, intensive, and special-
grammatical-placing are constrained to appear. If
a no-classification is possible, then the grammatical
features: becoming-attribute, intensive, and special-
grammatical-placing appear. The former set results in
clauses with a functional structure of the form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.460989">
o- VERB demi
HONORIFIC X COPULA-be
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905">
which, as we have seen, expresses additional distance
between the action and its performance as required.
The latter set is sufficient to constrain the structure
produced to be of the form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.763699">
o- VERB ni naru
HONORIFIC X CASE becoming
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791083333333">
which is the less indirect expression of respect.
By way of contrast, the portion of the &apos;politeness&apos;
chooser that is concerned with the expression of hu-
mility, rather than respect, is shown in figure 1.
Formerly, any such decision tree would only have
been able to call for the appearance of a single gram-
matical feature; here any number of features may be
selected (as indicated by the 1-1-+&apos; operator in figure
1) during the decision tree&apos;s traversaL Modelling the
kind of non-local organization inherent in the expres-
sion of politeness would therefore have required nu-

ical organization. This subordinates the semantic or-
ganization to the grammatical organization and nec-
essarily obscures the unity of the politeness masoning
process. By allowing the two levels of grammar and
semantics their own, not necessarily isomorphic, di-
mensions of organization it is possible to express the
unity and coherence of patterns at either level and to
capture the relationship between those levels.
5 Example of the genera-
tion of appropriately polite
clauses
In this section, the generation of an actual utter-
ance exhibiting complex attributes of politeness is il-
lustrated. The utterance is drawn from a corpus of
telephone conversations concerning hotel reservations.
The traces given are those actually produced by the
currently implemented Japanese systemic grammar
program that is written in Symbolics Common Lisp
and runs upon a Symbolics 3600 Lisp Machine.
The context for the utterance is as follows. After a
negotiation of precisely where, when, and how long the
customer is to stay, the person responsible for hotel
booking states that he will send the confirmation of
the reservation to the customer &apos;today&apos;. It is worth
noting that the &apos;direct&apos; translation of this statement
in terms of its ideational content (perhaps glossable
as a very neutral I will send it today), such as might
be handled by current machine translation systems,
would be quite inappropriate in a genuine interactive
situation such as the one described. What was actually
said was of the following form:
kyou hassou smote- itadaki- tel to omoimasu
today send do-cause receive wish think
forward humbly
might I be permitted to send it today?
During generation the grammar causes the politeness
reasoning chooser network to be entered; this performs
the classifications shown in figure 2, the humility sec-
tion of this reasoning may be followed through in figure
1 also.
The grammatical features constrained to appear in
this case, i.e. wishfulness, favours, cause, etc., then
result in particular predetermined paths being taken
through the grammar network. For example, figure
3 shows when the grammatical system responsible
for the construction of the functional structure con-
cerned with the expression of causality is entered.3

This grammatical system offer two alternative selec-
tions of feature: one which constrains the structure
generated to be an expression of causation and one
which does not. Here, since the grammatical feature
cause has been constrained to appear by the polite-
ness chooser, no further reasoning needs to be done
at this point and the construction of the appropriate
structure may proceed directly (via excution of the re-
alization statements associated with the cause feature,
which call for a variety of operations to be performed
on functionally-labelled constituents such as AGENT,
PROCESS, etc.).
Similarly preselected grammatical decisions are
made for each of the other regions of the grammar
responsible for creating the structure required to ex-
press the politeness need as determined during polite-
ness reasoning. This serves to build the structure of
the example sentence as an appropriate realization of
the distinctions in politeness that were ascertained to
be necessary by the politeness chooser inquiries.

It has been shown how a straightforward extension of
the chooser and inquiry framework employed within
the Nigel grammar permits its application to the
control of the resources for expressing politeness in
Japanese. In addition to the choice of humble and
respectful forms of expression illustrated here, this
mechanism has been used in one current version of
the grammar to support the selection of appropriate
verbs of `giving&apos; and their combinations with other
processes for the expression of favors done and con-
sideration for other&apos;s actions, the selection of the par-
ticipants or circumstances in the clause that are to
be made &apos;thematic&apos;, and the selection of appropriate
levels of speech (familiar, polite, deferential) across a
variety of grammatical forms.
The flexibility that this approach offers for cap-
turing the semantic distinctions involved in interper-
sonal meanings is allowing us to apply to interper-
sonal knowledge the technique that was adopted for
ideational meanings of determining the knowledge that
needs to be maintained for satisfactory control of the
resources of the grammar. An examination of how the
inquiries informally glossed here may be implemented
with respect to an actual knowledge base significantly
constrains the types of constructs and their interre-
lationships that that knowledge base will be required
to support. Thus notions of relative social position,
obligations owed, favors done, social situation types,
putational systemic framework implemented in Nigel ap-
pear in this trace, e.g. the entering of grammatical systems
&apos;recursively&apos; and the insertion of multiple functions of the
same type, as in AGENT.1 and AGENT.2. These are be-
yond the scope of this paper however; their details may be
found in Bateman et at. (1987).
consequences of actions upon other people, and oth-
ers that adequate inquiries have been found to rely
upon are isolated in a linguistically-motivated and con-
strained manner for incorporation in the interpersonal
component of any knowledge base that is intended to
support Japanese text generation. It is to be expected
that similar results may be found with respect to En-
glish also and so the identification of the interpersonal
constructs necessary for knowledge bases for English
text generation is now a clear priority.
A more general application of the extension to the
inquiry semantics approach illustrated here is that it
opens up the possibility of using the chooser and in-
quiry framework to capture the selection of grammat-
ical forms according to the uses that are to be made of
those forms, without imposing the grammar&apos;s organi-
zation upon the decision trees that control that selec-
tion. Since this non-isomorphism between distinctions
that are to be drawn between uses and the distinctions
that are maintained in the grammar is as widespread
across English as it is across Japanese, it is to be ex-
pected that the mechanism proposed here could find
wide application. However, further experimentation
into the mechanism&apos;s utility and appropriateness as a
representation of what is involved in areas of language
use where this occurs needs to be undertaken.

<abstract confidence="0.999604058823529">The inquiry semantics approach of the Nigel computational systemic grammar of English has proved capable of revealing distinctions within propositional content that the text planning process needs to control in order for adequate text to be generated. An extension to the chooser and inquiry framework motivated by a Japanese clause generator capable of expressing levels of politeness makes this facility available for revealing the distinctions necessary among interpersonal, social meanings also. This paper shows why the previous inquiry framework was incapable of the kind of semantic control Japanese politeness requires and how the implemented extension achieves that control. An example is given of the generation of a sentence that is appropriately polite for its context of use and some implications for future work are suggested.</abstract>
