This paper describes FrameNet (Lowe et al., 1997; Baker
et al., 1998; Fillmore et al., 2002), an online lexical re-
source for English based on the principles of frame se-
mantics (Fillmore, 1977a; Fillmore, 1982; Fillmore and
Atkins, 1992), and considers the FrameNet database in
reference to the proposed ISO model for linguistic an-
notation of language resources (ISO TC37 SC4 )(ISO,
2002; Ide and Romary, 2001b). We provide a data cat-
egory specification for frame semantics and FrameNet
annotations in an RDF-based language. More specifi-
cally, we provide a DAML+OIL markup for lexical units,
defined as a relation between a lemma and a semantic
frame, and frame-to-frame relations, namely Inheritance
and Subframes. The paper includes simple examples of
FrameNet annotated sentences in an XML/RDF format
that references the project-specific data category specifi-
cation.

2 Frame Semantics and the FrameNet
Project
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977269230769">
FrameNet’s goal is to provide, for a significant portion
of the vocabulary of contemporary English, a body of
semantically and syntactically annotated sentences from
which reliable information can be reported on the va-
lences or combinatorial possibilities of each item in-
cluded.
A semantic frame is a script-like structure of infer-
ences, which are linked to the meanings of linguistic
units (lexical items). Each frame identifies a set of
frame elements (FEs), which are frame-specific seman-
tic roles (participants, props, phases of a state of affairs).
Our description of each lexical item identifies the frames
which underlie a given meaning and the ways in which
the FEs are realized in structures headed by the word.
The FrameNet database documents the range of semantic
and syntactic combinatory possibilities (valences) of each
word in each of its senses, through manual annotation of
example sentences and automatic summarization of the
resulting annotations. FrameNet I focused on governors,
meaning that for the most part, annotation was done in re-
spect to verbs; in FrameNet II, we have been annotating
in respect to governed words as well.1 This paper will
explain the theory behind FrameNet, briefly discuss the
annotation process, and then describe how the FrameNet
data can be represented in RDF, using DAML+OIL, so
that researchers on the semantic web can use the data.

2.0.1 Frame Semantic Background
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910421052632">
In Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1976; Fillmore, 1977b;
Fillmore and Atkins, 1992; Petruck, 1996), a linguistic
unit, in our case, a word (in just one of its senses), evokes
a particular frame. An “evoked” frame is the structure of
knowledge required for the understanding of a given lexi-
cal or phrasal item. The frames in question can be simple
– small static scenes or states of affairs, simple patterns
of contrast, relations between entities and the roles they
serve – or possibly quite complex event types that pro-
vide the background for words that profile one or more of
their phases or participants.
For example, the word bartender evokes a scene of ser-
vice in a setting where alcoholic beverages are consumed,
and profiles the person whose role is to prepare and serve
these beverages. In a sentence like The bartender asked
for my ID, it is the individual who occupies that role that
we understand as making the request, and the request for
identification is understood against the set of assumptions
and practices of that frame.

2.0.2 Replacement: An Example Frame
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999347464285714">
A schematic description of the REPLACEMENT frame
will include an AGENT effecting a change in the relation-
ship between a PLACE (which can be a role, a function,
a location, a job, a status, etc.) and a THEME. For ex-
ample, in the sentence Sal replaced his cap on his bald
head, Sal fills the role of AGENT, his cap instantiates
the FE THEME, and on his bald head is the PLACE. The
words defined in terms of this frame include exchange.v,
interchange.v, replace.v, replacement.n, substitute.v, sub-
stitution.n, succeed.v, supplant.v, swap.v, switch.v, and
trade.v.
The REPLACEMENT frame involves states of affairs
and transitions between them such that other situations
are covered: an “old theme”, which we refer to as OLD,
starts out at the PLACE and ends up not at the PLACE,
while a “new theme”, which we call NEW, starts out not
at the PLACE and ends up at the PLACE (as in Factory
owners replaced workers by machines).
Syntactically, the role of AGENT can be expressed by
a simple NP (e.g. Margot switched her gaze to the floor,
a conjoined NP (e.g. Margot and her admirer exchanged
glances), or two separate constituents, an NP and a PP
(e.g. Margot exchanged glances with her admirer). Sim-
ilarly, PLACE may be expressed as one PP or two. Com-
pare Ginny switched the phone between hands and Ginny
switched the phone from one hand to the other. And, if
OLD and NEW are of the same type, they can be expressed
as a single FE (e.g. The photographer switched lenses).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992833">
2.1 The FrameNet Process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999848115384615">
Using attested instances of contemporary English,
FrameNet documents the manner in which frame ele-
ments (for given words in given meanings) are grammat-
ically instantiated in English sentences and organizes and
exhibits the results of such findings in a systematic way.
For example, in causative uses of the words, an expres-
sion about replacing NP with NP takes the direct object
as the OLD and the oblique object as the NEW (e.g. Nancy
replaced her desktop computer with a laptop), whereas
substituting NP for NP does it the other way around (e.g.
Nancy substituted a laptop for her desktop computer).
A commitment to basing such generalizations on attes-
tations from a large corpus, however, has revealed that in
both UK and US English, the verb substitute also partic-
ipates in the valence pattern found with replace, i.e. we
find examples of substituting the OLD with the NEW (e.g.
Nancy subsitituted a laptop with her desktop computer).
In their daily work, FrameNet staff members record the
variety of combinatorial patterns found in the corpus for
each word in the FrameNet lexicon, present the results
as the valences of the words, create software capable of
deriving from the annotations as much other information
as possible about the words, and add manually only that
information which cannot – or cannot easily – be derived
automatically from the corpus or from the set of anno-
tated examples.

2.2 Frame-to-Frame Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912">
The FrameNet database records information about sev-
eral different kinds of semantic relations, consisting
mostly of frame-to-frame relations which indicate seman-
tic relationships between collections of concepts. The
two that we consider here are Inheritance and Sub-
frames.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.626062">
2.2.1 Inheritance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99924268">
Frame Inheritance is a relationship by which a sin-
gle frame can be seen as an elaboration of one or more
other parent frames, with bindings between the inherited
semantic roles. In such cases, all of the frame elements,
subframes, and semantic types of the parent have equal
or more specific correspondents in the child frame. Con-
sider for example, the CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP frame,
which characterizes the appointment of a new leader or
removal from office of an old one, and whose FEs in-
clude: SELECTOR, the being or entity that brings about
the change in leadership (in the case of a democratic pro-
cess, the electorate); OLD LEADER, the person removed
from office; OLD ORDER, the political order that existed
before the change; NEW LEADER, the person appointed
to office; and ROLE, the position occupied by the new or
old leader. Some of the words that belong to this frame
describe the successful removal from office of a leader
(e.g. overthrow, oust, depose), others only the attempt
(e.g. uprising, rebellion). This frame inherits from the
more abstract REPLACEMENT frame described above,
with the following FEs further specified in the child: OLD
and NEW are narrowed to humans beings or political en-
tities, i.e. OLD LEADER and NEW LEADER, respectively;
and PLACE is an (abstract) position ofpolitical power, i.e.
ROLE.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.858187">
2.2.2 Subframes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999836">
The other type of relation between frames which is cur-
rently represented in the FN database is between a com-
plex frame and several simpler frames which constitute
it. We call this relationship Subframes. In such cases,
frame elements of the complex frame may be identified
(mapped) to the frame elements of the subparts, although
not all frame elements of one need have any relation to
the other. Also, the ordering and other temporal rela-
tionships of the subframes can be specified using binary
precedence relations. To illustrate, consider the complex
CRIMINAL PROCESS frame, defined as follows: A Sus-
pect is arrested by an AUTHORITY on certain CHARGES,
then is arraigned as a DEFENDANT. If at any time the
DEFENDANT pleads guilty, then the DEFENDANT is sen-
tenced, otherwise the DEFENDANT first goes to trial. If
the VERDICT after the trial is guilty, then the DEFEN-
DANT is sentenced. In the end, the DEFENDANT is ei-
ther released or is given a SENTENCE by a JUDGE at
the sentencing. For each step in the process, there is a
separate frame in the database, including ARREST, AR-
RAIGNMENT, TRIAL, SENTENCING, and so on. Each of
these frames is related to the CRIMINAL PROCESS frame
via the SubFrame relation in the frame editor. Moreover,
subframes (of the same complex frame) are related to
each other through their ordering.
We have recognized the need to deal with other types
of relations among frames, and, so far, have identified
two, SeeAlso, and Using. Currently, many Using rela-
tions are indicated in the FrameNet database.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998682">
2.3 The FrameNet Product
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879625">
The FrameNet database contains descriptions of more
than 7,000 lexical units based on more than 130,000 an-
notated sentences. This information is available for a
wide range of natural language processing applications,
including question answering, machine translation, and
information extraction.
The FN database can be seen both as a dictionary and
a thesaurus. As a dictionary, each lexical unit (LU)
(lemma in a given sense) is provided with (1) the name of
its frame, (2) a definition, (3) a valence description which
summarizes the attested combinatorial possibilities, and
(4) access to annotated examples. The FN database can
also be seen as a thesaurus, associating groups of lexical
units in frames and associating frames with each other
(see below). The FrameNet database differs from existing
lexical resources in the specificity of the frames and se-
mantic roles it defines, the information it provides about
relations between frames, and the degree of detail pro-
vided on the possible syntactic realizations of semantic
roles for each LU.
While Ide, et al., (2002)(Ide et al., 2002) offers a rep-
resentation scheme for dictionaries and other lexical data,
the kind of information in the FrameNet database is not
expressed in the same level of depth in any existing print
dictionary or computational lexical resource. For in-
stance, while WordNet describes semantic relations be-
tween words, it does not recognize conceptual schemas,
i.e. frames, that mediate in these relations, and therefore
does not have the means to link arguments of predicating
words with the semantic roles they express. FrameNet
also differs from WordNet in showing semantic relations
across parts of speech, and in providing contextual infor-
mation enriched with semantics (beyond the ”Someone
s something” format of WordNet argument-structure
representations). Thus, the complex relational structure
inherent in the FrameNet frame element and frame-to-
frame relations exercises and potentially extends the ISO
TC37 SC4 standard (ISO, 2002). The rest of this paper
describes our encoding of the FrameNet database in an
RDF-based environment.

3 A Data Category Specification for Frame
Semantics in RDF
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961714285714">
The World Wide Web (WWW) contains a large amount
of information which is expanding at a rapid rate. Most
of that information is currently being represented using
the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is de-
signed to allow web developers to display information in
a way that is accessible to humans for viewing via web
browsers. While HTML allows us to visualize the infor-
mation on the web, it doesn’t provide much capability to
describe the information in ways that facilitate the use
of software programs to find or interpret it. The World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed the Exten-
sible Markup Language (XML) which allows informa-
tion to be more accurately described using tags. As an
example, the word crawl on a web site might represent
an offline search process (as in web crawling) or an ex-
position of a type of animate motion. The use of XML to
provide metadata markup, such as for crawl, makes the
meaning of the word unambiguous. However, XML has
a limited capability to describe the relationships (schemas
or ontologies) with respect to objects. The use of ontolo-
gies provides a very powerful way to describe objects and
their relationships to other objects. The DAML language
was developed as an extension to XML and the Resource
Description Framework (RDF). The latest release of the
language (DAML+OIL) (http://www.daml.org) provides
a rich set of constructs with which to create ontologies
and to markup information so that it is machine readable
and understandable.
Framenet-1 has been translated into DAML+OIL.
We developed an automatic translator from FrameNet
to DAML+OIL which is being updated to reflect
FrameNet2 data. With periodic updates as the FrameNet
data increases, we expect it to become useful for var-
ious applications on the Semantic Web. DAML+OIL
is written in RDF (http://www.w3.org/TR/daml+oil-
walkthru/#RDF1), i.e., DAML+OIL markup is
a specific kind of RDF markup. RDF, in turn,
is written in XML, using XML Namespaces
(http://www.w3.org/TR/daml+oil-walkthru/#XMLNS),
and URIs. Thus, our framenet declaration begins with an
RDF start tag including several namespace declarations
of the form:

So in this document, the rdf: prefix should be un-
derstood as referring to things drawn from the names-
pace called http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-
ns#. This is a conventional RDF declaration appear-
ing verbatim at the beginning of almost every rdf doc-
ument. The second and third declarations make simi-
lar statements about the RDF Schema and XML Schema
datatype namespaces. The fourth declaration says that in
this document, elements prefixed with daml: should be
understood as referring to things drawn from the names-
pace called http://www.w3.org/2001/03/daml+oil#. This
again is a conventional DAML+OIL declaration. We
use the XML entity model to use shortcuts with re-
ferring to the URIs.2 The other DAML+OIL on-
tologies used in the FrameNet description include
the DAML-S (http://www.daml.org/services) service
ontologies, the OpenCYC DAML ontology (http://
www.cyc.com/2002/04/08/cyc.daml), and the SRI time
ontology (http:// www.ai.sri.com/ daml/ontologies/ sri-

vised with the new DAML+OIL time ontology effort.

The most general object of interest is a frame. We de-
fine the FRAME class as a daml:class We then define a
bunch of bookkeeping properties on the FRAME class. An
example of the name property is shown below.

In FrameNet, the basic relation between a word
(Lemma) and a frame is the Lexical Unit (LU). The do-
main of the Lexical Unit is a Lemma or word and its range
is a Frame. An LU is defined in DAML as a property.

Roles are relations defined on frames ranging over the

its frame. We leave the type of the filler unrestricted at

ther. Note that we use the daml:samePropertyAs relation
to specify synonyms. The fragment below specifies that
Frame Element, Role, and FE are synonyms.

The relation between frames (such as ARREST) and
CRIMINAL PROCESS is often captured by a set of bind-
ings between frame elements (such as the arrested person
is the same individual as the person charged who is the
same individual as the defendant in a criminal process).
To capture such bindings, we introduce a special relation
called bindingRelation whose domain and range are roles
(either from the same or different frames).
&lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;bindingRelation&amp;quot;&gt;
&lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Role&amp;quot;/&gt;
&lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Role&amp;quot;/&gt;
&lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt;
By far the most important binding relation is the iden-
tification of roles (i.e. they refer to the same value (ob-
ject)). This can be specified through the relation identify
which is a subProperty of bindingRelation. Note that in
order to do this, we have to extend the DAML+OIL lan-
guage which does not allow properties to be defined over
other properties. We use the DAML-S ontology primitive
daml-s:sameValuesAs to specify the identify relations.

In FrameNet, a frame may inherit (A ISA B) from
other frames or be composed of a set of subframes
(which are frames themselves). For instance, the frame
CRIMINAL PROCESS has subframes that correspond to
various stages (ARREST, ARRAIGNMENT, CHARGE,
etc.). Subframe relations are represented using the
daml:objectProperty.3

&lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt;
A central relation between subframes is one of tem-
poral ordering. We use precedes (in the sense of imme-
diately precedes)) to encode this relation between sub-
frames.
&lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;precedes&amp;quot;&gt;

&lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#subFrame&amp;quot;/&gt;

We can define a property temporalOrdering that is the
transitive version of precedes.
daml:TransitiveProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;TemporalOrdering&amp;quot;&gt;
&lt;rdfs:label&gt;TemporalOrdering&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;

transitive, not that it is a transitive version of precedes.
DAML+OIL does not currently allow us to express this
relation. (see http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-
walkthru#properties).
Frame Elements may also inherit from each other. We
use the rdfs:subPropertyOf to specify this dependences.
For example, the following markup in DAML+OIL spec-
ifies that the role (Frame Element) MOTHER inherits from
the role (Frame Element) PARENT. Note we can add fur-
ther restrictions to the new role. For instance, we may
want to restrict the filler of the MOTHER to be female (as
opposed to animal for PARENT).

The CRIMINALPROCESS frame has a set of associated
roles. These roles include that of COURT, DEFENDANT,
PROSECUTION, DEFENSE, JURY, and CHARGES. Each
of these roles may have a filler with a specific seman-
tic type restriction. FrameNet does not specify the world
knowledge and ontology required to reason about Frame
Element filler types. We believe that one of the possible
advantages in encoding FrameNet data in DAML+OIL is
that as and when ontologies become available on the web
(uch as OpenCYC), we can link to them for this purpose.
In the example fragment below we use the CYC Court-
Judicial collection to specify the type of the COURT and
the CYC Lawyer definition to specify the type restric-
tion on the frame element DEFENSE. For illustrative pur-
poses, the DAML+OIL markup below shows the use of
a different ontology (from CYC) to restrict the defendant
to be of type PERSON as defined in the example ontol-
ogy. This restriction uses the DAML+OIL example from

The set of binding relations involves a set of role
identification statements that specify that a role of a
frame (subframe) has the same value (bound to the
same object) as the role of a subframe (frame). We
could specify these constraints either a) as anonymous
subclass restrictions on the criminal process class (see
http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-ex for examples)
or b) we could name each individual constraint (and
thus obtain a handle onto that property). We chose the
later method in our DAML+OIL encoding of FrameNet
to allow users/programs to query any specific con-
straint (or modify it). Note also that the use of the
dotting notation (A.b) to specify paths through sim-
ple and complex frames and is not fully supported
in DAML+OIL (see http://www.daml.org/services/daml-

4.1 Basic Annotation of Verb Arguments and
Complements as Triplets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.928977863636364">
Consider the following sentence, which is annotated for
the target nab, a verb in the ARREST frame; the frame
elements represented are the arresting AUTHORITIES, the
SUSPECT and the TIME when the event took place:
[Authorities Police] nabbed [ Suspect the
man], who was out on licence from prison,
[ Time when he returned home].
The phrase who was out on licence from prison pro-
vides additional information about the SUSPECT, but it is
not syntactically an argument or complement of the tar-
get verb nab, nor semantically an element of the ARREST
frame, so it is not annotated.
How do we intend to represent this in XML conform-
ing to the proposed standards? The header of the file will
refer to the FrameNet Data Category specification dis-
cussed in the last section, but hereafter we will omit the
domain name space specifications and use a more human-
readable style of XML. The conversion to the full ISO
style should be straightforward.

The entity &lt;lexunit-annotation&gt;, which com-
prises the rest of the file includes attributes giving the
name of the lexical unit (nab), the name of the frame
(ARREST), and the part of speech of the lemma (verb).
The first included element is a definition of the lemma
within the frame, seen on line 4.
The entities contained within the lexunit-annotation
are called subcorpora; each represents a particular syn-
tactic pattern, combination of collocates, etc. In the case
of nab, there are so few instances of the word that we
have lumped them all into one subcorpus as indicated by
the subcorpus name “all” on line 5. It might seem logi-
cal that the entities within the subcorpus should be sen-
tences, but in fact, we recognize the possibility that one
sentence might be annotated several times, for several tar-
gets. There might even be several instances of the same
target lemma in the same sentence in the same frame
(e.g. The FBI nabbed Jones in NYC, while the Moun-
ties nabbed Smith in Toronto), each with its own set of
FEs. Therefore, the next smaller entity is the annotation
set (line 6).
The annotation set4, shown below, consists of the
&lt;sentence&gt;, which contains only the &lt;text&gt; of the
sentence, and a set of layers, each consisting of a set of
labels. Each label has attributes start and end, giving the
stating and ending position in the text to which it is ap-
plied. This sentence is typical of the basic FrameNet an-
notation style, in that there are three main layers, one for
frame elements (“FE”, line 8), one for the phrase type
(PT) of each FE (line 22), and one for the grammatical
function (GF) of each FE (line 15). In each case, there
are three coextensive labels; thus the word Police, in text
positions 0-5 expresses the FE AUTHORITIES (line 10),
has the phrase type “NP” (line 24) and is the subject of the
verb nab, which we refer to as external argument “Ext”
(line 17). The other two frame elements are shown by
similar triplets, SUSPECT-NP-Obj and TIME-Swh-Comp,
the latter meaning a complement of the verb consisting of
a clause (S-node) introduced by a WH-relative.

4The XML shown here is somewhat simplified from the rep-
resentation being distributed by FrameNet, which includes at-
tributes on each label giving an ID number, the date and time
of creation, the name of the annotator, etc. In these examples,
we use several XML tags without defining them. Without go-
ing into unnecessary detail, we note here that they can be de-
fined in the DCS and the Dialect specification as described in
(Ide and Romary, 2001a). We are also using a condensed no-
tation with multiple attributes on entities for reasons of space,
although proper RDF requires that they be split out.
There are three other layers shown in the example,
none of which contain labels, called Sentence, Verb, and
Other. The layer Target contains the single label Target;
the fact that nab is the target word is indicated in the same
way as the information about FEs.
Note that this XML format is “standoff” annotation in
the sense that the labels refer to text locations by charac-
ter positions (allowing any number of labels on various
layers, overlapping labels, etc.), but that the text and the
annotations appear in the same document. This is con-
trary to the general sense of the ISO standard, which uses
indirect pointers to an entirely separate document con-
taining the primary data. The indirect approach has cer-
tain advantages, and where the primary data is audio or
video, is virtually unavoidable. But in the case of the
current FrameNet data, where the annotations all apply
to individual sentences, there seem to be some advan-
tages, at least for human readers, of having the text of
the sentence and the annotation contained within a fairly
low-level XML entity, allowing the reader to glance back
and forth between them.5 In formulating standards for
linguistic annotation, it might be wise to take these ad-
vantages and disadvantages into consideration; perhaps
either situation might be allowable under the standard.

4.2 Other Types of Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977972095238095">
As the basic unit of annotation is the label, which can be
applied to anything ranging from a single character to an
entire sentence, and there are no a priori constraints on
labels overlapping, a great variety of information can be
represented in this way. We will not be able to demon-
strate all the possibilities here, but we will give a some
representative examples.
In FrameNet, event nouns are annotated in the same
frame (and hence with the same FEs) as the correspond-
ing verbs; the main differences are that the syntactic pat-
terns for the FEs of nouns are more varied, and (with
rare exceptions), no FEs of nouns are required to be ex-
pressed. Consider the noun arrest, also in the ARREST
frame, in the sentence:
Two witnesses have come forward with infor-
mation that could lead to [ Suspect the killer ’s]
arrest.
In this case the SUSPECT is expressed as a possessive (the
killer’s; it could equally well have been in a PP headed by
of (the arrest of the killer).

5The location of the sentences in the original corpora is still
recoverable from the aPos attribute, which gives the absolute
position from which the sentence was abstracted. The name of
the corpus is given in another attribute which has been omitted
in the example.

In addition to marking the FE SUSPECT from ARREST,
we could also annotate the same sentence again in the
CAUSATION frame with the target lead, which would cre-
ate an annotation set listed under the the LU lead to:
Two witnesses have come forward with [ Cause
information that] could lead [ Effect to the

The same sentence would be annotated in two differ-
ent frames, and the semantics of the two frames could
(in theory) be combined compositionally to get the se-
mantics of the phrase information that could lead to the
killer’s arrest. Similar processes of annotating in multi-
ple frames with targets come forward (and possibly wit-
ness as well) should yield a full semantics of the sentence.

We provide a data category specification for frame semantics and FrameNet annotations in an RDF-based language. More specifiwe provide a DAML+OIL markup for defined as a relation between a lemma and a semantic and frame-to-frame relations, namely The paper includes simple examples of FrameNet annotated sentences in an XML/RDF format that references the project-specific data category specification. 2 Frame Semantics and the FrameNet Project FrameNet’s goal is to provide, for a significant portion of the vocabulary of contemporary English, a body of semantically and syntactically annotated sentences from which reliable information can be reported on the valences or combinatorial possibilities of each item included. A semantic frame is a script-like structure of inferences, which are linked to the meanings of linguistic units (lexical items). Each frame identifies a set of frame elements (FEs), which are frame-specific semantic roles (participants, props, phases of a state of affairs). Our description of each lexical item identifies the frames which underlie a given meaning and the ways in which the FEs are realized in structures headed by the word. The FrameNet database documents the range of semantic and syntactic combinatory possibilities (valences) of each word in each of its senses, through manual annotation of example sentences and automatic summarization of the resulting annotations. FrameNet I focused on governors, meaning that for the most part, annotation was done in respect to verbs; in FrameNet II, we have been annotating respect to governed words as This paper will explain the theory behind FrameNet, briefly discuss the annotation process, and then describe how the FrameNet data can be represented in RDF, using DAML+OIL, so that researchers on the semantic web can use the data. 2.0.1 Frame Semantic Background In Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1976; Fillmore, 1977b; Fillmore and Atkins, 1992; Petruck, 1996), a linguistic in our case, a word (in just one of its senses), a particular frame. An “evoked” frame is the structure of knowledge required for the understanding of a given lexical or phrasal item. The frames in question can be simple – small static scenes or states of affairs, simple patterns of contrast, relations between entities and the roles they serve – or possibly quite complex event types that provide the background for words that profile one or more of their phases or participants. example, the word a scene of service in a setting where alcoholic beverages are consumed, and profiles the person whose role is to prepare and serve beverages. In a sentence like bartender asked my it is the individual who occupies that role that we understand as making the request, and the request for identification is understood against the set of assumptions and practices of that frame.</abstract>

For example, in causative uses of the words, an expresabout NP with NP the direct object the the oblique object as the her desktop computer with a whereas NP for NP it the other way around (e.g. substituted a laptop for her desktop A commitment to basing such generalizations on attestations from a large corpus, however, has revealed that in UK and US English, the verb particin the valence pattern found with i.e. we examples of subsitituted a laptop with her desktop In their daily work, FrameNet staff members record the variety of combinatorial patterns found in the corpus for each word in the FrameNet lexicon, present the results the the words, create software capable of deriving from the annotations as much other information as possible about the words, and add manually only that information which cannot – or cannot easily – be derived automatically from the corpus or from the set of annotated examples. 2.2 Frame-to-Frame Relations The FrameNet database records information about several different kinds of semantic relations, consisting mostly of frame-to-frame relations which indicate semantic relationships between collections of concepts. The that we consider here are Sub- 2.2.1 Inheritance a relationship by which a single frame can be seen as an elaboration of one or more other parent frames, with bindings between the inherited semantic roles. In such cases, all of the frame elements, subframes, and semantic types of the parent have equal or more specific correspondents in the child frame. Confor example, the OF LEADERSHIP which characterizes the appointment of a new leader or removal from office of an old one, and whose FEs inthe being or entity that brings about the change in leadership (in the case of a democratic prothe electorate); the person removed office; the political order that existed the change; the person appointed office; and the position occupied by the new or old leader. Some of the words that belong to this frame describe the successful removal from office of a leader oust, others only the attempt This frame inherits from the abstract described above, the following FEs further specified in the child: narrowed to humans beings or political eni.e. LEADER respectively; an (abstract) position ofpolitical power, i.e. 2.2.2 Subframes The other type of relation between frames which is currently represented in the FN database is between a complex frame and several simpler frames which constitute We call this relationship In such cases, frame elements of the complex frame may be identified (mapped) to the frame elements of the subparts, although not all frame elements of one need have any relation to the other. Also, the ordering and other temporal relationships of the subframes can be specified using binary precedence relations. To illustrate, consider the complex PROCESS defined as follows: A Susis arrested by an certain is arraigned as a If at any time the guilty, then the senotherwise the goes to trial. If the trial is guilty, then the sentenced. In the end, the eireleased or is given a a the sentencing. For each step in the process, there is a frame in the database, including and so on. Each of frames is related to the PROCESS via the SubFrame relation in the frame editor. Moreover, subframes (of the same complex frame) are related to each other through their ordering. We have recognized the need to deal with other types of relations among frames, and, so far, have identified and Currently, many Using relations are indicated in the FrameNet database. 2.3 The FrameNet Product The FrameNet database contains descriptions of more than 7,000 lexical units based on more than 130,000 annotated sentences. This information is available for a wide range of natural language processing applications, including question answering, machine translation, and information extraction. The FN database can be seen both as a dictionary and thesaurus. As a dictionary, each unit (LU) (lemma in a given sense) is provided with (1) the name of its frame, (2) a definition, (3) a valence description which summarizes the attested combinatorial possibilities, and (4) access to annotated examples. The FN database can also be seen as a thesaurus, associating groups of lexical units in frames and associating frames with each other (see below). The FrameNet database differs from existing lexical resources in the specificity of the frames and semantic roles it defines, the information it provides about relations between frames, and the degree of detail provided on the possible syntactic realizations of semantic roles for each LU. While Ide, et al., (2002)(Ide et al., 2002) offers a representation scheme for dictionaries and other lexical data, the kind of information in the FrameNet database is not expressed in the same level of depth in any existing print dictionary or computational lexical resource. For instance, while WordNet describes semantic relations between words, it does not recognize conceptual schemas, i.e. frames, that mediate in these relations, and therefore does not have the means to link arguments of predicating words with the semantic roles they express. FrameNet also differs from WordNet in showing semantic relations across parts of speech, and in providing contextual information enriched with semantics (beyond the ”Someone s something” format of WordNet argument-structure representations). Thus, the complex relational structure inherent in the FrameNet frame element and frame-toframe relations exercises and potentially extends the ISO TC37 SC4 standard (ISO, 2002). The rest of this paper describes our encoding of the FrameNet database in an RDF-based environment. 3 A Data Category Specification for Frame Semantics in RDF The World Wide Web (WWW) contains a large amount of information which is expanding at a rapid rate. Most of that information is currently being represented using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is designed to allow web developers to display information in a way that is accessible to humans for viewing via web browsers. While HTML allows us to visualize the information on the web, it doesn’t provide much capability to describe the information in ways that facilitate the use of software programs to find or interpret it. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed the Extensible Markup Language (XML) which allows information to be more accurately described using tags. As an the word a web site might represent search (as in web crawling) or an exof a type of The use of XML to metadata markup, such as for makes the meaning of the word unambiguous. However, XML has a limited capability to describe the relationships (schemas or ontologies) with respect to objects. The use of ontologies provides a very powerful way to describe objects and their relationships to other objects. The DAML language was developed as an extension to XML and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The latest release of the language (DAML+OIL) (http://www.daml.org) provides a rich set of constructs with which to create ontologies and to markup information so that it is machine readable and understandable. Framenet-1 has been translated into DAML+OIL. We developed an automatic translator from FrameNet to DAML+OIL which is being updated to reflect FrameNet2 data. With periodic updates as the FrameNet data increases, we expect it to become useful for various applications on the Semantic Web. DAML+OIL is written in RDF (http://www.w3.org/TR/daml+oilwalkthru/#RDF1), i.e., DAML+OIL markup is a specific kind of RDF markup. RDF, in is written in XML, using XML Namespaces (http://www.w3.org/TR/daml+oil-walkthru/#XMLNS), and URIs. Thus, our framenet declaration begins with an RDF start tag including several namespace declarations of the form: &lt;?Xml version=’1.0’ encoding=’ISO-8859-1’?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE uridef[ &lt;!ENTITY rdf &amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;!ENTITY rdfs &amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;!ENTITY xsd &amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;!ENTITY daml &amp;quot;http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;!ENTITY daml &amp;quot;http://www.daml.org/services/daml-s/0.9/process&amp;quot;&gt; ]&gt; &lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf = &amp;quot;&amp;rdf;#&amp;quot; xmlns:rdfs = &amp;quot;&amp;rdfs;#&amp;quot; xmlns:xsd = &amp;quot;&amp;xsd;#&amp;quot; xmlns:daml = &amp;quot;&amp;daml;#&amp;quot; xmlns:CYC = &amp;quot;&amp;cyc;#&amp;quot; &gt; So in this document, the rdf: prefix should be understood as referring to things drawn from the namespace called http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntaxns#. This is a conventional RDF declaration appearing verbatim at the beginning of almost every rdf document. The second and third declarations make similar statements about the RDF Schema and XML Schema datatype namespaces. The fourth declaration says that in this document, elements prefixed with daml: should be understood as referring to things drawn from the namespace called http://www.w3.org/2001/03/daml+oil#. This again is a conventional DAML+OIL declaration. We use the XML entity model to use shortcuts with reto the The other DAML+OIL ontologies used in the FrameNet description include the DAML-S (http://www.daml.org/services) service ontologies, the OpenCYC DAML ontology (http:// www.cyc.com/2002/04/08/cyc.daml), and the SRI time ontology (http:// www.ai.sri.com/ daml/ontologies/ sribasic/1-0/Time.daml) which is currently being revised with the new DAML+OIL time ontology effort. http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/ snarayan/frame-2.damlhas a complete namespace and imported ontology list. most of interest is a frame. We dethe as a daml:class We then define a of bookkeeping properties on the An example of the name property is shown below. &lt;daml:Class rdf:ID=&amp;quot;Frame&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:comment&gt; The most general class &lt;/rdfs:comment&gt; &lt;/daml:Class&gt; &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;Name&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Frame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;&amp;rdf-schema;#Literal&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; In FrameNet, the basic relation between a word (Lemma) and a frame is the Lexical Unit (LU). The domain of the Lexical Unit is a Lemma or word and its range is a Frame. An LU is defined in DAML as a property. &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID= &amp;quot;LU&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Lexeme&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Frame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; that all URIs are globally scoped, so without this the entire path has to be specified. Roles are relations defined on frames ranging over the specific type of the filler. We use daml:objectProperty to define the roles of a frame. The domain of a role is its frame. We leave the type of the filler unrestricted at this level, allowing specific roles to specialize this further. Note that we use the daml:samePropertyAs relation to specify synonyms. The fragment below specifies that Frame Element, Role, and FE are synonyms. &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID= &amp;quot;role&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Frame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;&amp;daml;#Thing&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;frameElement&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;daml:samePropertyAs rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#role&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;FE&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;daml:samePropertyAs rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#role&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; use the various constructs etc. from DAML to specify cardinality restrictions on the fillers of a role property. The markup fragment below shows the specification of a single valued role. &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID= &amp;quot;singleValuedRole&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Frame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf&gt; &lt;daml:Restriction daml:maxCardinality=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;daml:onProperty rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Role&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:Restriction&gt; &lt;/rdfs:subClassOf&gt; &lt;/daml:Class&gt; relation between frames (such as and often captured by a set of bindbetween frame elements (such as the person the same individual as the charged is the individual as the a criminal process). To capture such bindings, we introduce a special relation domain and range are roles (either from the same or different frames). &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;bindingRelation&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Role&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Role&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; By far the most important binding relation is the identification of roles (i.e. they refer to the same value (object)). This can be specified through the relation identify which is a subProperty of bindingRelation. Note that in order to do this, we have to extend the DAML+OIL language which does not allow properties to be defined over other properties. We use the DAML-S ontology primitive daml-s:sameValuesAs to specify the identify relations. &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;identify&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#bindingRelation&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Role&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;daml-s:sameValuesAs rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#rdfs:range&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; In FrameNet, a frame may inherit (A ISA B) from other frames or be composed of a set of subframes (which are frames themselves). For instance, the frame subframes that correspond to stages etc.). Subframe relations are represented using the &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;subFrameOf&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Frame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Frame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; A central relation between subframes is one of temporal ordering. We use precedes (in the sense of immediately precedes)) to encode this relation between subframes. &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;precedes&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#subFrame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#subFrame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; We can define a property temporalOrdering that is the transitive version of precedes. daml:TransitiveProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;TemporalOrdering&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:label&gt;TemporalOrdering&lt;/rdfs:label&gt; &lt;/daml:TransitiveProperty&gt; Note that the temporalOrdering property only says it is transitive, not that it is a transitive version of precedes. DAML+OIL does not currently allow us to express this relation. (see http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oilwalkthru#properties). Frame Elements may also inherit from each other. We use the rdfs:subPropertyOf to specify this dependences. For example, the following markup in DAML+OIL specthat the role (Frame Element) from role (Frame Element) Note we can add further restrictions to the new role. For instance, we may to restrict the filler of the be female (as to animal for &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;mother&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#parent&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Female&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; With these basic frame primitives defined, we are ready to look at an example using the Criminal Process frames. 3.1 An Example: The Criminal Process Frame basic frame is the It is a type of background frame. CP is used as a shorthand for this frame. subFrameOfrelation has a direct translation to a richer semantic representation that is able to model and reason about complex processes (such as buying, selling, reserving tickets) and services on the web. While the details of the representation are outside the scope of the this paper, the interested reader can look at (Narayanan and McIlraith, 2002) for an exposition of the markup language and its operational semantics. &lt;daml:Class rdf:ID=&amp;quot;CriminalProcess&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Frame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:Class&gt; &lt;daml:Class rdf:ID=&amp;quot;CP&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;daml:sameClassAs rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#CriminalProcess&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:Class&gt; has a set of associated These roles include that of and Each of these roles may have a filler with a specific semantic type restriction. FrameNet does not specify the world knowledge and ontology required to reason about Frame Element filler types. We believe that one of the possible advantages in encoding FrameNet data in DAML+OIL is that as and when ontologies become available on the web (uch as OpenCYC), we can link to them for this purpose. In the example fragment below we use the CYC Courtcollection to specify the type of the the CYC Lawyer definition to specify the type restricon the frame element For illustrative purposes, the DAML+OIL markup below shows the use of a different ontology (from CYC) to restrict the defendant be of type defined in the example ontology. This restriction uses the DAML+OIL example from http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-ex) &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;court&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#FE&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#CriminalProcess&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;&amp;CYC;#Court-Judicial&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;defense&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#FE&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#CriminalProcess&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;&amp;CYC;#Lawyer&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;defendant&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#FE&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#CriminalProcess&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;&amp;daml-ex;Person&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; The set of binding relations involves a set of role identification statements that specify that a role of a frame (subframe) has the same value (bound to the same object) as the role of a subframe (frame). We could specify these constraints either a) as anonymous subclass restrictions on the criminal process class (see http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-ex for examples) or b) we could name each individual constraint (and thus obtain a handle onto that property). We chose the later method in our DAML+OIL encoding of FrameNet to allow users/programs to query any specific constraint (or modify it). Note also that the use of the dotting notation (A.b) to specify paths through simple and complex frames and is not fully supported in DAML+OIL (see http://www.daml.org/services/damls/2001/10/rationale.html and also (Narayanan and McIlraith, 2002) for more info). &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;prosecutionConstraint&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#identify&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#CP.prosecution&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Trial.prosecution&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;defendantConstraint&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#identify&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#CP.defendant&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Arrest.suspect&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; of the are defined by their type (LexicalFrame or a Background- For example, Lexical Frames while a BackgroundFrame are subframes of We subthe to specify the individual subframe relations (shown below for the relation subframeOf(Criminal Process, Arraignment)). &lt;daml:Class rdf:ID=&amp;quot;Arrest&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:comment&gt; A subframe &lt;/rdfs:comment&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#LexicalFrame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:Class&gt; &lt;daml:Class rdf:ID=&amp;quot;Arraignment&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:comment&gt; A subframe &lt;/rdfs:comment&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#LexicalFrame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:Class&gt; &lt;daml:Class rdf:ID=&amp;quot;Trial&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:comment&gt; A subframe &lt;/rdfs:comment&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#BackgroundFrame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:Class&gt; &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;arraignSubFrame&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#subFrameOf&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#CP&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Arraignment&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; To specify the the relation precedes(Arrest, Arraignwe restrict the property (the doof) the to have as one of its range the frame (class) This is done using the property restriction feature with DAML+OIL as follows. &lt;daml:Class rdf:about=&amp;quot;#Arrest&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf&gt; &lt;daml:Restriction&gt; &lt;daml:onProperty rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#precedes&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;daml:hasClass rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Arraignment&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:Restriction&gt; &lt;/rdfs:subClassOf&gt; &lt;/daml:Class&gt; With this markup of the ontology, we can create annotation instances for examples with targets that belong to its associated) frames. At the current stage, we have converted all of FrameNet 1 data (annotations and frame descriptions) to DAML+OIL. The translator has also been updated to handle the more complex semantic relations (both frame and frame element based) in FrameNet 2. We plan to release both the XML and the RDF-based DAML+OIL versions of all FrameNet 2 releases. 4 Examples of Annotated Sentences 4.1 Basic Annotation of Verb Arguments and Complements as Triplets Consider the following sentence, which is annotated for target a verb in the the frame represented are the arresting the the the event took place: Suspectthe man], who was out on licence from prison, Timewhen he returned home]. phrase was out on licence from prison proadditional information about the but it is not syntactically an argument or complement of the tarverb nor semantically an element of the frame, so it is not annotated. How do we intend to represent this in XML conforming to the proposed standards? The header of the file will refer to the FrameNet Data Category specification discussed in the last section, but hereafter we will omit the domain name space specifications and use a more humanreadable style of XML. The conversion to the full ISO style should be straightforward. 1 &lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;?&gt; 2 [DOCTYPE definitions like those shown in the preceding section go here ] 3 &lt;lexunit-annotation name=&amp;quot;nab&amp;quot; frame=&amp;quot;Arrest&amp;quot; pos=&amp;quot;V&amp;quot;&gt; 4 &lt;definition&gt;COD: catch (someone) doing something wrong. &lt;/definition&gt; 5 &lt;subcorpus name=&amp;quot;V-001-all&amp;quot;&gt; entity which comprises the rest of the file includes attributes giving the name of the lexical unit (nab), the name of the frame and the part of speech of the lemma (verb). The first included element is a definition of the lemma within the frame, seen on line 4. The entities contained within the lexunit-annotation are called subcorpora; each represents a particular syntactic pattern, combination of collocates, etc. In the case there are so few instances of the word that we have lumped them all into one subcorpus as indicated by the subcorpus name “all” on line 5. It might seem logical that the entities within the subcorpus should be sentences, but in fact, we recognize the possibility that one sentence might be annotated several times, for several tar- There might even be several instances of the target lemma in the same sentence in the same frame FBI in NYC, while the Mounin each with its own set of Therefore, the next smaller entity is the 6). annotation shown below, consists of the which contains only the the sentence, and a set of layers, each consisting of a set of labels. Each label has attributes start and end, giving the stating and ending position in the text to which it is applied. This sentence is typical of the basic FrameNet annotation style, in that there are three main layers, one for frame elements (“FE”, line 8), one for the phrase type (PT) of each FE (line 22), and one for the grammatical function (GF) of each FE (line 15). In each case, there three coextensive labels; thus the word in text 0-5 expresses the FE 10), has the phrase type “NP” (line 24) and is the subject of the which we refer to as external argument “Ext” (line 17). The other two frame elements are shown by triplets, and the latter meaning a complement of the verb consisting of a clause (S-node) introduced by a WH-relative. 6 &lt;annotationSet status=&amp;quot;MANUAL&amp;quot;&gt; 7 &lt;layers&gt; 8 &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;FE&amp;quot;&gt; 9 &lt;labels&gt; 10 &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Authorities&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;5&amp;quot; /&gt; 11 &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Suspect&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;14&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;20&amp;quot; /&gt; 12 &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;61&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;81&amp;quot; /&gt; 13 &lt;/labels&gt; 14 &lt;/layer&gt; 15 &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;GF&amp;quot;&gt; 16 &lt;labels&gt; 17 &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Ext&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;5&amp;quot; /&gt; 18 &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Obj&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;14&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;20&amp;quot; /&gt; 19 &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Comp&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;61&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;81&amp;quot; /&gt; 20 &lt;/labels&gt; 21 &lt;/layer&gt; 22 &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;PT&amp;quot;&gt; 23 &lt;labels&gt; 24 &lt;label name=&amp;quot;NP&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;5&amp;quot; /&gt; 25 &lt;label name=&amp;quot;NP&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;14&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;20&amp;quot; /&gt; 26 &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Swh&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;61&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;81&amp;quot; /&gt; 27 &lt;/labels&gt; 28 &lt;/layer&gt; 29 &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;Sent&amp;quot; /&gt; 30 &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;Other&amp;quot; /&gt; 31 &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;Target&amp;quot;&gt; 32 &lt;labels&gt; 33 &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Target&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;7&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;12&amp;quot; /&gt; 34 &lt;/labels&gt; 35 &lt;/layer&gt; 36 &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;Verb&amp;quot; /&gt; 37 &lt;/layers&gt; 38 &lt;sentence aPos=&amp;quot;34400709&amp;quot;&gt; 39 &lt;text&gt;Police nabbed the man, who was out on licence from prison, when he returned home. &lt;/text&gt; 40 &lt;/sentence&gt; 41 &lt;/annotationSet&gt; XML shown here is somewhat simplified from the representation being distributed by FrameNet, which includes attributes on each label giving an ID number, the date and time of creation, the name of the annotator, etc. In these examples, we use several XML tags without defining them. Without going into unnecessary detail, we note here that they can be defined in the DCS and the Dialect specification as described in (Ide and Romary, 2001a). We are also using a condensed notation with multiple attributes on entities for reasons of space, although proper RDF requires that they be split out. There are three other layers shown in the example, none of which contain labels, called Sentence, Verb, and Other. The layer Target contains the single label Target; fact that the target word is indicated in the same way as the information about FEs. Note that this XML format is “standoff” annotation in the sense that the labels refer to text locations by character positions (allowing any number of labels on various layers, overlapping labels, etc.), but that the text and the annotations appear in the same document. This is contrary to the general sense of the ISO standard, which uses indirect pointers to an entirely separate document containing the primary data. The indirect approach has certain advantages, and where the primary data is audio or video, is virtually unavoidable. But in the case of the current FrameNet data, where the annotations all apply to individual sentences, there seem to be some advantages, at least for human readers, of having the text of the sentence and the annotation contained within a fairly low-level XML entity, allowing the reader to glance back forth between In formulating standards for linguistic annotation, it might be wise to take these advantages and disadvantages into consideration; perhaps either situation might be allowable under the standard. 4.2 Other Types of Annotation As the basic unit of annotation is the label, which can be applied to anything ranging from a single character to an entire sentence, and there are no a priori constraints on labels overlapping, a great variety of information can be represented in this way. We will not be able to demonstrate all the possibilities here, but we will give a some representative examples. In FrameNet, event nouns are annotated in the same frame (and hence with the same FEs) as the corresponding verbs; the main differences are that the syntactic patterns for the FEs of nouns are more varied, and (with exceptions), no FEs of nouns are be ex- Consider the noun also in the frame, in the sentence: Two witnesses have come forward with inforthat could lead to [ Suspectthe killer ’s] this case the expressed as a possessive it could equally well have been in a PP headed by arrest of the &lt;annotationSet status=&amp;quot;MANUAL&amp;quot;&gt; location of the sentences in the original corpora is still from the which gives the absolute position from which the sentence was abstracted. The name of the corpus is given in another attribute which has been omitted in the example. &lt;layers&gt; &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;FE&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;labels&gt; &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Suspect&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;68&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;80&amp;quot; /&gt; &lt;/labels&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;GF&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;labels&gt; &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Gen&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;68&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;80&amp;quot; /&gt; &lt;/labels&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;PT&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;labels&gt; &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Poss&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;68&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;80&amp;quot; /&gt; &lt;/labels&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;Sent&amp;quot; /&gt; &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;Other&amp;quot; /&gt; &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;Target&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;labels&gt; &lt;label name=&amp;quot;Target&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;82&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;87&amp;quot; /&gt; &lt;/labels&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer name=&amp;quot;Noun&amp;quot; /&gt; &lt;/layers&gt; &lt;sentence aPos=&amp;quot;102536099&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;text&gt;Two witnesses have come forward with information that could lead to the killer’s arrest. &lt;/text&gt; &lt;/sentence&gt; &lt;/annotationSet&gt; addition to marking the FE we could also annotate the same sentence again in the with the target which would crean annotation set listed under the the LU witnesses have come forward with [ that] could Effectto the killer’s arrest].

The FN database can also be seen as a thesaurus, associating groups of lexical units in frames and associating frames with each other (see below). The FrameNet database differs from existing lexical resources in the specificity of the frames and semantic roles it defines, the information it provides about relations between frames, and the degree of detail provided on the possible syntactic realizations of semantic roles for each LU. While Ide, et al., (2002)(Ide et al., 2002) offers a representation scheme for dictionaries and other lexical data, the kind of information in the FrameNet database is not expressed in the same level of depth in any existing print dictionary or computational lexical resource. For instance, while WordNet describes semantic relations between words, it does not recognize conceptual schemas, i.e. frames, that mediate in these relations, and therefore does not have the means to link arguments of predicating words with the semantic roles they express.

Fillmore snarayan, miriamp, collinb, fillmore@icsi.berkeley.edu International Computer Science Institute 1947 Center St., Berkeley, California 1 Abstract This paper describes FrameNet (Lowe et al., 1997; Baker et al., 1998; Fillmore et al., 2002), an online lexical resource for English based on the principles of frame semantics (Fillmore, 1977a; Fillmore, 1982; Fillmore and Atkins, 1992), and considers the FrameNet database in reference to the proposed ISO model for linguistic annotation of language resources (ISO TC37 SC4 )(ISO, 2002; Ide and Romary, 2001b). We provide a data category specification for frame semantics and FrameNet annotations in an RDF-based language. More specifically, we provide a DAML+OIL markup for lexical units, defined as a relation between a lemma and a semantic frame, and frame-to-frame relations, namely Inheritance and Subframes. The paper includes simple examples of FrameNet annotated sentences in an XML/RDF format that references the project-specific data category specification. 2 Frame Semantics and the FrameNet Project FrameNet’s goal is to provide, for a significant portion of the vocabulary</context>

FrameNet also differs from WordNet in showing semantic relations across parts of speech, and in providing contextual information enriched with semantics (beyond the ”Someone s something” format of WordNet argument-structure representations). Thus, the complex relational structure inherent in the FrameNet frame element and frame-toframe relations exercises and potentially extends the ISO TC37 SC4 standard (ISO, 2002). The rest of this paper describes our encoding of the FrameNet database in an RDF-based environment. 3 A Data Category Specification for Frame Semantics in RDF The World Wide Web (WWW) contains a large amount of information which is expanding at a rapid rate. Most of that information is currently being represented using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is designed to allow web developers to display information in a way that is accessible to humans for viewing via web browsers. While HTML allows us to visualize the information on the web, it doesn’t provide much capability to descri</context>

It is a type of background frame. CP is used as a shorthand for this frame. 3The subFrameOfrelation has a direct translation to a richer semantic representation that is able to model and reason about complex processes (such as buying, selling, reserving tickets) and services on the web. While the details of the representation are outside the scope of the this paper, the interested reader can look at (Narayanan and McIlraith, 2002) for an exposition of the markup language and its operational semantics. &lt;daml:Class rdf:ID=&amp;quot;CriminalProcess&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Frame&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:Class&gt; &lt;daml:Class rdf:ID=&amp;quot;CP&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;daml:sameClassAs rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#CriminalProcess&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:Class&gt; The CRIMINALPROCESS frame has a set of associated roles. These roles include that of COURT, DEFENDANT, PROSECUTION, DEFENSE, JURY, and CHARGES. Each of these roles may have a filler with a specific semantic type restriction. FrameNet does not specify the world knowledge and ontology required to reason about Frame Element filler types. We bel</context>

We chose the later method in our DAML+OIL encoding of FrameNet to allow users/programs to query any specific constraint (or modify it). Note also that the use of the dotting notation (A.b) to specify paths through simple and complex frames and is not fully supported in DAML+OIL (see http://www.daml.org/services/damls/2001/10/rationale.html and also (Narayanan and McIlraith, 2002) for more info). &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;prosecutionConstraint&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#identify&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#CP.prosecution&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Trial.prosecution&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; &lt;daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;quot;defendantConstraint&amp;quot;&gt; &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#identify&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#CP.defendant&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Arrest.suspect&amp;quot;/&gt; &lt;/daml:ObjectProperty&gt; Subframes of the CRIMINALPROCESS frame are defined by their type (LexicalFrame or a BackgroundFrame).

FrameNet I focused on governors, meaning that for the most part, annotation was done in respect to verbs; in FrameNet II, we have been annotating in respect to governed words as well.1 This paper will explain the theory behind FrameNet, briefly discuss the annotation process, and then describe how the FrameNet data can be represented in RDF, using DAML+OIL, so that researchers on the semantic web can use the data. 2.0.1 Frame Semantic Background In Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1976; Fillmore, 1977b; Fillmore and Atkins, 1992; Petruck, 1996), a linguistic unit, in our case, a word (in just one of its senses), evokes a particular frame. An “evoked” frame is the structure of knowledge required for the understanding of a given lexical or phrasal item. The frames in question can be simple – small static scenes or states of affairs, simple patterns of contrast, relations between entities and the roles they serve – or possibly quite complex event types that provide the background for words that profile one or more of their phases or participants. For example, the word bartender evokes a scene of service in a setting where alcoholic bev</context>
