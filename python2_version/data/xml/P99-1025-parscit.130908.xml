<bodyText confidence="0.99936">
In this paper we describe a systematic
approach for creating a dialog management
system based on a Construct Algebra, a
collection of relations and operations on
a task representation. These relations
and operations are analytical components
for building higher level abstractions called
dialog motivators. The dialog manager, con-
sisting of a collection of dialog motivators,
is entirely built using the Construct Algebra.

1 INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926274193549">
The dialog manager described in this paper
implements a novel approach to the problem
of dialog management. There are three ma-
jor contributions: the task knowledge repre-
sentation, a Construct Algebra and a collec-
tion of dialog motivators. The task knowl-
edge representation exploits object-oriented
paradigms. The dialog motivators provide
the dialog manager with the dialog strate-
gies that govern its behavior. The Construct
Algebra provides the building blocks needed
to create new dialog motivators and analyze
them.
The first main component of this dialog
manager is the task knowledge representa-
tion. The task knowledge is encoded in ob-
jects. These objects form an inheritance hi-
erarchy that defines the relationships that
exists among these objects. The dialog man-
ager exploits this inheritance hierarchy in de-
termining what queries to pose to the user.
No explicit states and transitions need to be
defined using this framework (Bennacef et
al., 1996; Meng and et. al., 1996; Sadek et
al., 1996). A change to the dialog does not
require a change to the dialog manager, but
more simply, a change to the inheritance hi-
erarchy.
The second main component of this dia-
log manager is the collection of dialog mo-
tivators. The dialog motivators determine
what actions need to be taken (e.g. ask a
confirmation question). The dialog motiva-
tors are founded on a theoretical framework
called a Construct Algebra. The Construct
Algebra allows a designer to add new moti-
vators in a principled way. Creating a new
application requires defining the inheritance
hierarchy and perhaps additional dialog mo-
tivators not encompassed in the existing col-
lection.
This dialog manager has been used for two
applications. The first is a spoken dialog sys-
tem that enables a user to respond to the
open-ended prompt How may I help you?
(HMIHY) (Gorin et al., 1997). The sys-
tem recognizes the words the customer has
said (Riccardi and Bangalore, 1998) and ex-
tracts the meaning of these words (Wright
et al., 1998) to determine what service
they want, conducting a dialog (Abella and
Gorin, 1997; Abella et al., 1996) to effec-
tively engage the customer in a conversa-
tion that will result in providing the service
they requested. The second application is
to Voice Post Query (VPQ) (Buntschuh et
al., 1998) which provides spoken access to
the information in large personnel database
(&gt; 120,000 entries). A user can ask for em-
ployee information such as phone number,
fax number, work location, or ask to call
an employee. These applications are signifi-

dialog manager.

2 Task Representation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973027027027">
Information about the task is defined us-
ing an object inheritance hierarchy. The in-
heritance hierarchy defines the relationships
that exist amongst the task knowledge. Ob-
jects are defined to encode the hierarchy.
This representation adheres to the princi-
ples of object-oriented design as described
in (Booch, 1994). Each of the objects has
three partitions. The first partition contains
the name of the object, the second contains
a list of variables with associated values that
are specific to the object, and the third par-
tition contains any methods associated with
the object. For simplicity of illustration we
will not include any of the methods. Each
of the objects inherits its methods from a
higher level object called the Construct. The
Construct&apos;s methods are the relations and
operations that will be described in section 4.
The result of the speech recognizer is
sent to the spoken language understanding
(SLU) module. The SLU module extracts
the meaning of the user&apos;s utterance and pro-
duces a list of possible objects with asso-
ciated confidence scores that is interpreted
by the dialog manager. The dialog manager
then uses the inheritance hierarchy and an
algorithm&apos; fully described in (Abella and
Gorin, 1997) to produce a set of semanti-
cally consistent inputs to be used by the di-
alog manager. The input is represented as
a boolean expression of constructs extracted
from the utterance. This input is then ma-
nipulated by the dialog motivators to pro-
duce an appropriate action, which most of-
ten consists of playing a prompt to the user
or generating a query to a database.

knowledge is encoded as a hierarchy of con-
structs. The construct itself is represented as
a tree structure which allows for the build-
ing of a containment hierarchy. It consists
of two parts, a head and a body. Figure 1
illustrates a construct example for HMIHY.
The DIAL_FOR_ME construct is the head
and it has two constructs for its body, FOR-
WARD_NUMBER and BILLING. These two
constructs represent the two pieces of in-
formation necessary to complete a call. If
a user calls requesting to place a call it is
the DIAL_FOR_ME construct that is created
with the generic BILLING construct and
the FORWARD_NUMBER construct with
its value set to empty. The dialog manager
will then ask for the forward number and for
the type of billing method. In figure 1 the
dialog manager has received a response to
the forward number request.

4 Construct Algebra

<bodyText confidence="0.999922">
The construct algebra defines a collection of
elementary relations and operations on a set
of constructs. These relations and opera-
tions are then used to build the larger pro-
cessing units that we call the dialog moti-
vators. The set of dialog motivators defines
the application. In this section we formally
define these relations and operations.

The Construct Algebra defines six relations
in the set of constructs. In each of the
definitions, c1 and c2 are constructs. Note
that the symbols C and c, introduced here,
should not be understood in their usual

but will be described in definitions 4 and 5.

<bodyText confidence="0.998173">
Definition 3 requires that the heads of c1
and c2 be equal. Recall that the head of a
construct is an ordered pair &lt;name,value&gt;
which means that their names and values
must be equal. A value may be empty
(NULL) and by definition be equal to any
other value. The equality of bodies means
that a bijective mapping exists from the
body of c1 into the body of c2 such that
elements associated with this mapping are
equal.

database querying.
The disambiguation motivator determines
when there is ambiguous semantic informa-
tion, like conflicting billing methods. Con-
firmation is used when the SLU returns a
result with low confidence. Error handling
takes on three forms. There is error recovery
when the speech recognizer has likely misrec-
ognized what the user has said (low confi-
dence scores associated with the recognition
results), when the user falls silent, and when
the user says something the SLU does not
expect or does not handle. Missing infor-
mation determines what information to ask
about in order to complete a transaction.
Context switching is the ability of the sys-
tem to realize when the user has changed
his/her mind or realizes that it has mis-
understood and allows the user to correct
it. The continuation motivator determines
when it is valid to offer the user the choice to
query the system for additional information.
Database querying decides when the system
has acquired enough information to query a
database for the requested information.

The motivator runs through several checks
on the construct c. The first is to check to see
if in fact the motivator applies, or in other
words if c is a restriction of AMBIGUITY.
If it is not then the motivator simply return
C without changing it. The second step is
to check to see if the ERROR construct is a
generalization of CA where CA represents the
user&apos;s response. The ERROR construct rep-
resents an error condition like silence or mis-
recognition. If it is, then it goes on to next
motivator because this motivator does not
apply to error conditions. If CA equals the
IDK construct then this means that the user
did not know the answer to our query and we
add the construct used for disambiguation,
ccj to the set of constructs c/DK. If however,
CA is in the containment generalization rela-
tion with c then the projection operation is
applied and the result is returned. If CA is
not in this relation then this indicates a con-
text switch on the part of the user and the
disambiguation motivator returns CA as the
result.
All other motivators are constructed in a
similar fashion. An application can use these
motivators or create new ones that are ap-
plication specific using the operations and
relations of the Construct Algebra.

<bodyText confidence="0.999950818181818">
The input to the dialog manager is a collec-
tion of semantic input generated by the SLU.
Figure 10 illustrates the algorithm used by
the dialog manager. The output is the com-
plete construct c which no longer requires
further dialog. The algorithm loops through
all the dialog motivators determining which
one needs to be applied to c. If it finds a mo-
tivator that applies then it will perform the
necessary action (e.g. play a prompt or do
a database lookup). The algorithm repeats
itself to obtain CA (the construct answer). In
other words, the construct that results from
the action is subject to the dialog motiva-
tors starting from the beginning. Once CA
has been found to be complete it is combined
with c using Construct Algebra to produce
a new construct. This new construct c also
goes through the loop of dialog motivators
and the procedure continues until no moti-
vator applies and the algorithm returns the
final construct c.

To illustrate how the dialog manager func-
tions we will use an example from VPQ.
Figure 11 illustrates a sample dialog with
the system. The sequence of motivators for
VPQ is error handling, confirmation, miss-
ing information, database querying and dis-
ambiguation. The construct that is created
as a result of the user&apos;s initial utterance
is shown in figure 12. All the information
needed to do a database lookup is found in
the user&apos;s utterance, namely the piece of in-
formation the user is seeking and the name
of the person. Therefore the first motivator
that applies is database querying. This moti-
vator creates the database query and based
on the result creates the construct CA. The
construct CA is then searched by each of the
motivators beginning again with error han-
dling. The motivator that applies to CA is
the disambiguation motivator because there
are more than 20 people in the database
whose last name is pronounced Klein, in-
cluding Klein, Cline and Kline. The dis-
ambiguation motivator searches through CA
to determine, based on preset parameters,
which piece of information is most useful for
the disambiguation process as well as which
piece of information the user is likely to
know, which is selected when the inheritance
hierarchy is designed. For VPQ this includes
asking about the first name and work loca-
tion. In this example the dialog manager
searches the database entries and determines
that the most discriminating piece of infor-
mation is the first name. Once the user re-
sponds with the first name there are still 2
possible candidates and it asks for the next
piece of information which is work location.
Had the user not known the work location
the system would have read out the phone
number of both people since the total num-
ber of matches is less than 3. If the num-
ber of entries after disambiguation remains
greater than 3 the system refers the user to
a live operator during work hours.

In this paper we have described a novel ap-

and without the need to define call flows in
the traditional finite-state approach. The
Construct Algebra serves as the building
blocks from which the dialog motivators
that drive the dialog system are comprised.

an analytical tool that allows the dialog mo-
tivators to be formally defined and analyzed
and provides an abstraction hierarchy that
hides the low-level details of the implemen-

tors. This same dialog manager is currently
being used by two very different applications
(HMIHY and VPQ).

This dialog manager has been used for two applications. The first is a spoken dialog system that enables a user to respond to the open-ended prompt How may I help you? (HMIHY) (Gorin et al., 1997). The system recognizes the words the customer has said (Riccardi and Bangalore, 1998) and extracts the meaning of these words (Wright et al., 1998) to determine what service they want, conducting a dialog (Abella and Gorin, 1997; Abella et al., 1996) to effectively engage the customer in a conversation that will result in providing the service they requested.

Each of the objects inherits its methods from a higher level object called the Construct. The Construct&apos;s methods are the relations and operations that will be described in section 4. The result of the speech recognizer is sent to the spoken language understanding (SLU) module. The SLU module extracts the meaning of the user&apos;s utterance and produces a list of possible objects with associated confidence scores that is interpreted by the dialog manager. The dialog manager then uses the inheritance hierarchy and an algorithm&apos; fully described in (Abella and Gorin, 1997) to produce a set of semantically consistent inputs to be used by the dialog manager. The input is represented as a boolean expression of constructs extracted from the utterance. This input is then manipulated by the dialog motivators to produce an appropriate action, which most often consists of playing a prompt to the user or generating a query to a database. 3 The Construct A construct is the dialog manager&apos;s general knowledge representation vehicle.
