19881 propose an approach to linguistic paraphrasing
by adapting the Meaning-Text-Theory (MTT) [Mel&apos;Euk
and Zholkovsky, 1970] and its paraphrasing rules. Here,
we make more extensive use of the MTT in order to
provide a richer organization of lexis and its interaction
with grammar and knowledge than has been proposed
previously. Moreover, we develop this approach in the
context of a concrete generation environment, the PEN-
MAN system [Mann and Matthiessen, 1985], showing
some areas where the existing architecture is insufficient
and how the richer organization of lexis we propose can
help.
The following set of examples gives an impression of
the variety of linguistic phenomena that we include un-
der the term perspective.&apos; All the sentences can be in-
terpreted as verbalizations of a single abstract semantic
structure with differing aspects of that structure being
given emphasis in each case. For example, in (4), the
reader is made salient as a participant of the propo-
sition; in (5), the &apos;manner of achievement&apos; of the &apos;in-
dication&apos; is made salient; in (7), a particular temporal
aspect of the process, namely the beginning, is made
prominentput; and in (8), the intended purpose of the
agent is made salient as a &apos;making clear&apos;. While the
variation that can be seen between (1), (2), and (3) can
already be treated in, for example, the current PEN-
MAN system by exercising meaning options available in
the grammar (i.e., (2) exhibits passivization and (3)
nominalization of &apos;use), the variation shown in the re-
maining examples cannot be functionally motivated as
possible alternate grammatical realizations of the base
semantic form.

<bodyText confidence="0.999504083333334">
In this paper we address the organization and use of the
lexicon giving special consideration to how the salience
of certain aspects of abstract semantic structure may
be expressed. We propose an organization of the lex-
icon and its interaction with grammar and knowledge
that makes extensive use of lexical functions from the
Meaning-Text-Theory of Mel&apos;euk. We integrate this ap-
proach with the architecture of the PENMAN text gen-
eration system, showing some areas where that archi-
tecture is insufficient, and illustrating how the lexicon
can provide functionally oriented guidance for the gen-
eration process.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936666666667">
In natural language generation, the lexicon can be
viewed, generally, as containing information for the
verbalization of meanings. This information ranges
over both the static organization of vocabulary —
including lexical knowledge, often handled separately
as &amp;quot;lexical semantics&amp;quot; (see, e.g., [Pustejovsky, 1988;
Nirenburg and Raskin, 1987]) or &amp;quot;structural semantics&amp;quot;
— and the process of lexical choice. To make allowance
for this latter dynamic aspect of the lexical organiza-
tion we will henceforth use the term lexis common in
systemic linguistics [Hasan, 1987; Matthiessen, 1988]
instead of &amp;quot;lexicon&amp;quot;. Lexis thus represents lexical infor-
mation at various different levels of abstraction (strata)
and mapping structures that provide for the conversion
between those levels. In this paper we address the or-
ganization of lexis giving special consideration to the
expresssion and choice of appropriate expressions as a
function of the desired salience or prominence of seman-
tic elements. The choice set of possible configurations
of prominence we call the perspectives of the semantic
structure.
These have been addressed rarely in approaches in
generation so far: for example, [Jacobs, 1985] discusses
the verbs give and take as two different expressions of
the same event; [Nirenburg and Nirenburg, 19881 sug-
gest an approach to open-class lexical item selection for
realization of conceptual input; and [Iordanskaja et al.,

the dictionaries are deeply dedicated to computers.
9. The reader should take the use of the adjective &amp;quot;elec-

dedicated to computers.
Some of the phenomena running through these ex-
amples have been treated as lexical cooccurrence
[Apresjan et aL, 1969] or collocation [Firth, 1957;
Halliday, 1966; Hausmann, 1985]). Most extensively
they are handled by I. Mel&apos;euk et at. in the scope of
the Meaning-Text-Theory by means of lexical func-
tions (LFs). Our approach to generating this range
of variation takes its starting point, therefore, from
the notion of lexical cooccurrence relations addressed
by Mel&apos;Euk. There is a large body of descriptive work
based on the notion of LFs which has been carried out
for different languages [Mel&apos;Euk and Zholkovsky, 1984;
Mel&apos;Zuk et al., 1988; Zholkovsky, 1970; Reuther, 1978;
Janus, 1971] and we will suggest how this body of
knowledge can now provide significant input to work
on text generation.
In the next section we give an introduction to LFs as
the means by which lexical cooccurrence dependencies
are expressed within the MTT; we then describe some
problems with the existing organization of LFs as de-
fined by Mel&apos;euk et at. and show how that organization
can be developed further to be used for the modeling of
various perspectives. In the section following, we then
discuss the influence of lexis, when enriched by perspec-
tives, on the generation process and, subsequently, we
present a detailed example of the guidance this pro-
vides.

The Nature and Organization of Lexical
Functions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999187666666667">
Lexical cooccurrence in the scope of MTT is provided
in terms of lexical functions which Mel&apos;euk defines as
follows [Mel&apos;euk and Polguere, 1987];
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.994763111111111">
A lexical function f is a dependency that associates with
a lexeme L, called the argument of f, another lexeme
(or a set of (quasi-)synonymous lexemes) L&apos; which ex-
presses, with respect to L, a very abstract meaning (. . )
and plays a specific syntactic role. For instance, for a
noun N denoting an action, the LF Open % specifies a
verb (. ) which takes as its grammatical subject the
name of the agent _of the said action and as its direct
object, the lexeme N itself.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.878803142857143">
The values for any particular application of a LF to a
lexeme are provided by an Explanatory Combina-
torial Dictionary (ECD); dictionaries of this type for
a number of languages have already been compiled by
MTT researchers. Thus, for example, the ECD for En-
glish provides for the following applications of the LF
Operi:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.868263">
Open i (influence) = exert
Open i (punishment) = administer
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995943943396227">
These give lexical verbs appropriate for use when the
argument is to appear as a direct object to form a com-
bination where an agent (optionally) acts upon some
patient; e.g.: He exerted influence on P. . . , He ad-
ministered a punishment. . . , but not, * he exerted a
punishment.. . , * he administered an influence....
Cooccurrence relations of this kind are pervasive in
natural language and need to be captured in the rep-
resentation of a language&apos;s lexical resources. Such co-
occurrence relations can be rather arbitrary and so are
unlikely to be supportable by, for example, distinctions
maintained in the knowledge base. Their meaning is
not, however, arbitrary. An important claim of MTT is
that each LF represents a particular abstract meaning
which remains invariant across its various applications.
Thus, for example, further LFs include: Funco with
the meaning &apos;something takes place&apos; (Funco (accident)
= {occur, happen}, as in the sentence: The accident
occured two hours ago.); Result standing for a state
following the process addressed (Result (study) = mas-
ter, as in the sentence: John mastered his subject.); and
Liqu expressing an active process termination. This
latter LF is often used in so called composed LFs where
a number of LFs are combined in a predefined order
(LiquFunco (Fin) = {extinguish, put out}, as in the
sentence: The fire brigade could put out the fire quickly).
MTT classifies LFs into two general types: lex-
ical parameters, which provide syntagmatic rela-
tionships (e.g., Operi with i = 1,2,...), and lexi-
cal substitutes, which provide paradigmatic relation-
ships (e.g., Gener a specific generalization rela-
tion) [Mel&apos;euk and Zholkovsky, 1970]. However, since
LFs typically correspond to knowledge at varying lev-
els of abstraction in addition to lexical information,
these classes are still very heterogenous. Previous ap-
proaches that have made use of LFs in generation (e.g.,
[Kittredge and Mel&apos;euk, 1983; Iordanskaja et at., 1988;
Bourbeau et at., 19891) have been hindered by this. In
order to exploit the notion of LFs in generation more
extensively, we need further organizational principles
that emphasize the meanings distinct LFs possess.
Work in progress at IPSI suggests that the large num-
ber of heterogeneous LFs used within MTT can be or-
ganized coherently in terms of the functions and seman-
tic distinctions that they represent. Based on this, we
have defined part of a general model of lexis with a
taxonomic organization underlying it, within which the
most general structures provide the representations of
lexical semantics and the most delicate ones lexicaliza-
don. For the purposes of this paper, we will restrict
attention to the organization of LFs that are particu-
larly relevant for modeling situation perspectives as il-
lustrated in our examples above. In Figure 1 we set out

in network form general distinctive features that clas-
sify the meaning that the LFs we discuss here cover.2
The network explicates LFs by classifying each of them
according to a particular set of semantic features. The
general function of the network is thus to relate partic-
ular LFs to the functional conditions for their applica-
tion. This defines the meaning that any LF expresses
and so provides a functionally organized key into the
LF-oriented dictionaries being developed within MTT.
The network also shows the hierarchical arrangement
lying behind the meaning of LFs and so reflects the
relation of perspectives to one another.
We will now briefly describe in semantic terms a rep-
resentative set of the LFs covered by the network, show-
ing how the network relates perspectival presentation
decisions to choices of LFs.3 Then, with the organiza-
tional network of perspectives in place and motivated,
we show how it can be used to guide the generation
process to produce the kinds of variation illustrated in
(1)-(9).

Situation introduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998913">
One of the basic terms used in the scope of MTT is
that of abstract situations, circumscribed, roughly, as
something that takes place. In the sense of Mel&apos;euk,
abstract situations are defined by key terms and the
participants of the situations; the key term is designated
by the LF So, the participants as Si (i-th participant
of the situation). We view this construct here as an
abstract semantic partial specification of what is to be
expressed linguistically. Thus, looking at the situation
of teaching, the ECD for English offers us:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.994879666666667">
So (teaching) = teaching,
S1 (teaching) = teacher,
S2 (teaching) = pupil.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998363464285715">
The notion of situational key terms is closely related to
term of processes in the tradition of Systemic Functional
Grammar [Halliday, 1985; Steiner et al., 1987[.
When a situation is introduced, this may be done re-
specting a number of varying attributions of salience —
e.g., the salience of particular participants of a situation
or the situation itself.
The selection of particular combinations of process
and participants for the realization of abstract situa-
2The notation of Figure 1 follows that used within the
NIGEL grammar of the PENMAN system for the specification
of grammar possibilities. Names in capitals represent the
names of choice points, and names in lower case features
which may be selected: one from each choice point; also
square brackets represent disjunction of features and braces
conjunction. Such networks can be readily expressed in
a number of distinct formalisms, e.g., FUG (cf. [Kasper,
1988]), LOOM (cf. [Kasper, 198913]).

ified; space precludes a detailed discussion at this point,
although examples axe given below.
tions according to differing attributions of salience is
then provided in the scope of the ECD by LFs of vari-
ous groups. For example: Puric, which has the effect of
attributing salience to the term labeling the situation;
Oper, which has the effect of attributing salience to
one of the participants; and Labor which has the ef-
fect of attributing salience to a combination of the par-
ticipants. The selection of these broad groups is made
in the network by the choices available under SITUA-
TIONAL ORIENTATION, by the features &apos;situation ori-
ented&apos; (Func) and &apos;participant oriented&apos; (Oper, Labor).
These are further differentiated according to which
participants are affected; e.g.: Operi makes the &apos;first&apos;
participant of the situation salient (i.e., the participant
for which the LF Si provides a lexeme) and Oper2 the
&apos;second&apos; (i.e., the participant for which the LF S2 pro-
vides a lexeme): Oper2 (influence) = be under. Simi-
larly, Funco makes the key term of the situation itself
salient, while Film&apos; introduces the situation with par-
ticular respect to the first participant: Funco (problem)
= exist, Funci (problem) = come [from]. Labori2 makes
the first and the second participant salient, the first
more then the second, Laborn , on the contrary, makes
the second participant more salient, e.g.: Labor12 (pres-
sure) = bring to bear [on], Laborn (pressure) = get
[from]. These options are controlled by the further se-
lections of participants to be accorded salience in the
choice points SITUATION ORIENTATION and PARTICI-
PANT ORIENTATION.
Finally, the third option in the SITUATIONAL ORIEN-
TATION system, &apos;process orientation&apos; is responsible for
the neutral LF Vo, which provides the most direct lex-
ical verb for realizing the key term of a situation; e.g.,
Vo (influence) = [to] influence.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.88976">
Temporal dependency
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997464375">
LFs also address the global arrangement of a process on
the temporal axes by the definition of its preceding and
succeeding processes. These considerations are reached
in the network by a feature selection of {global tempo-
ral oriented, ... , } from the alternatives of the TEMPO-
RAL ORIENTATION choice point. These alternatives call
for the application of the LFs Prox and Perf; exam-
ples of which from the ECD for English are: ProxFunco
(storm) = brew, Perf (storm) = subside. In addition,
the internal temporal aspects of a process, represented
by its stages, are reflected by the corresponding triple
of &amp;quot;phasal&amp;quot; LFs: Ineep for the beginning, Cont for
continuing, and Fin for the termination stage. These
meanings are reached via the features under the &apos;stage
oriented&apos; option in the choice point PROCESS STAGES

Guiding the Generation Process by
Lexis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993727688311689">
The concrete generation system in which we are realiz-
ing organizational structures of lexis in order to sup-
port the emphasis of various salience aspects of se-
mantic structures is the PENMAN system [Mann and
Matthiessen, 1985]. The linguistic core of PENMAN is
a large systemic-functional grammar of English, the
NIGEL grammar [Matthiessen, 1983]. The semantic in-
terface of NIGEL is defined by a set of inquiries which
mediate the flow of information ,between the grammar
and external sources of information. PENMAN provides
structure for some of these external sources of informa-
tion, including a conceptual hierarchy of relations and
entities, called the Upper Model (UM) [Bateman et al.,
1990; Bateman, 1990]; the UM hierarchy classifies con-
cepts according to their possibilities for realization in
natural language and may be used as an interface be-
tween the organizational structures of Domain Knowl-
edge (DK) and the grammar&apos;s inquiries. PENMAN ac-
cepts demands for text to be generated in the notation
of the PENMAN Sentence Plan Language (SPL) [Kasper,
1989a]. SPL specifications are partial semantic repre-
sentations of what is to be realized through the gram-
matical resources of NIGEL. More formally, SPL expres-
sions are lists of terms describing the types of entities
and the particular features of those entities that are to
be expressed in English. The features of SPL terms
are either semantic relations to be expressed, which are
drawn from the upper model or from domain concepts
subordinated to the upper model, or direct specifica-
tions of responses to NIGEL&apos;S inquiries.4
To generate any of the sentences (1)-(9) above using
PENMAN, therefore, we must define appropriate SPL in-
put. However, as mentioned in the introduction, these
input specifications do not, at present, capture the gen-
eralization that these sentences share significant aspects
of their meaning. To capture this, while still maintain-
ing complete functional control of the generator, we in-
troduce a more abstract input specification, from which
particular SPL specifications are constructed depending
on additional salience-oriented semantic distinctions.
These semantic distinctions are specified in terms of the
hierarchical organization of the meanings of LFs shown
in the network of Figure 1. This organization provides
a statement of semantic feature interdependencies that
represents the perspectives available and the functional
motivations for choosing one perspective over another.
Each of the decision points in this network may place
constraints on the mapping between the abstract in-
put level and SPL. These decisions themselves need to
be made by a text planning component — the network
represents the capability of generating variation under
&apos;For full details of the PENMAN system and its com-
ponents, see the PENMAN documentation [The Penman
Project, 1989].
control rather than the control process itself. In this
sense, lexis as the stratum containing perspective infor-
mation provides a controlling mechanism for the gener-
ation process entirely analogously to the grammatical
network defined by NIGEL.
Example of perspective-guided
generation
We now illustrate the realization of some chosen per-
spectives in detail. Consider the clauses (1), (4), (6),
and (7) given above. The SPL input specifications nec-
essary to generate each of these clauses are set out in
Figure 2.5 As we can see, there is no connection be-
tween these since the generalization that they refer to
the same situation is captured neither within the gram-
mar, nor the upper model. Our new level of abstract in-
put to the generation process, which corresponds more
with Mel&apos;Euk&apos;s conception of &apos;abstract situation&apos; intro-
duced above, provides this connection as follows. Ab-
stract situations are represented in terms of a general
type and a set of participants drawn from the lexemes
defined with respect to the Domain Knowledge; for ex-
ample, the abstract input for the situation underlying
sentences (1), (4), (6), and (7) may be set out thus:6

<bodyText confidence="0.999980235294118">
In order to generate sentences from this specification,
we need to construct appropriate SPL expressions. This
we achieve by following the semantic alternatives made
in the LF network of Figure 1, applying the constraints
that it specifies to compose a mapping between the ab-
stract input and SPL.
Thus, for example, consider the context of use where
a text planner has determined, in addition to express-
ing the situation shown in the abstract input, that
that situation is to be presented textually as one in
which the process is introduced neutrally, without re-
spect for what preceded or succeeded, and with the pro-
cess and the first participant (we: S1) made relatively
more salient. This corresponds to the set of LF net-
work features {non-causal oriented, non-stage oriented,
global temporal oriented, current process, introduction
oriented, process-oriented, 1st participant processual}.

to So of the input form: the lexeme associated with the
DK concept use. The ECD for the language then sup-
plies a candidate lexical item — in this case, the process
use.
We integrate the information from the ECD by re-
quiring lexical items to be linked to concepts which are
subordinated to the PENMAN upper model. It is then
possible to determine, by inheritance, the particular set
of upper model/semantic role relations that are appro-
priate for a process of any type. The concept for use
is classified as a nondirected-action in the upper model
and so the role-set :actor, :actee is inherited. The
fillers of these roles are then selected from the ordered
set of participants specified in the abstract input under
S2 . The process then recurses for the complex filler
of S3 — filling, in this case, the :purpose upper model
relation — and the SPL given in Figure 2 for sentence
(1) is constructed.7
If the text planning component had determined that
a different set of presentational LF features were neces-
sary, then a different LF would be selected for applica-
tion to the key-term of the abstract input. Thus, with
the selection of the features {non-causal oriented, non-
stage oriented, global temporal oriented, current pro-
cess, result oriented, result intended, participant ori-
ented, 1st participant oriented}, which expresses the

within the confines of the present paper however.
intended effect of the process use with salience on its
first participant, the LF Reali is selected and, here, the
ECD gives the process illustrate. This term is then,
again, selected as the main term in the corresponding
SPL specification and, as before, since it is also linked
into the upper model, we know that the relevant role
set is :actor, :actee, :means. The further mapping
of situational roles Si to available UM-roles then pro-
vides the necessary fillers for the slots in the SPL. This
gives the SPL for sentence (6).
In sentences (4) and (7), the interaction between the
lexical network and the situation subordinated under
S3 in the abstract input is shown.8 For the situation of
&apos;indication&apos;, then, when the LF features: {non-causal
oriented, non-stage oriented, global temporal oriented,
current process, introduction oriented, participant ori-
ented, 2nd participant oriented} are required, express-
ing that the situation is introduced with emphasis on its
internal composition and participants and that the sec-
ond of those participants is the more salient, then the
LF Oper2 is selected for application to the filler of I S3
(i.e., indication). The ECD in this case supplies get.
Note that here, the LF Oper2 also has consequences for
the latter mapping between situational roles and upper
model roles; the key-term itself, So, is now associated
with the role :actee. This provides the SPL specifica-
tion for sentence (4).

8Work elsewhere (e.g., [Bateman and Paris, 1989]) has
shown that propositionally embedded components of an in-
put specification can be linguistically realized under certain
textual conditions as unembedded, or as dominating, con-

more thorough discussion.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991942857143">
We have shown how lexical cooccurrence relations can
be used to express the salience of particular aspects of
abstract semantic structures and how their underlying
meaning and communicative function can be organized
in order to influence the generation process. A spec-
ification of perspectival presentatation features as de-
fined in the network of Figure 1 makes it possible to
generate rather varied surface realizational forms. We
can view this network as a candidate for the textual
organization [Matthiessen, 1988] of lexis — which com-
plements the more traditional &apos;propositional&apos; organiza-
tion found in lexical discrimination nets (e.g., [Gold-
man, 1975]) and thesauri. The textual/communicative
functional meanings of LFs we propose, although ar-
guably inherent in the MTM, have not formerly been
extracted as an explicit principle of organization. We
suggest that this kind of organization may substan-
tially enhance the information collected by MTM re-
searchers. Finally, although we have restricted our-
selves in this paper to details that are particularly rel-
evant for modeling situation perspectives, we are work-
ing towards a general model of lexis including, e.g., a
semantically motivated classification of verbs, relations,
etc. as proposed by, for example, [Matthiessen, 1988;
Hasan, 1987] and pursued in a computational context
by [Fawcett and Tucker, 1989]. For this we also use a
set of further LFs represented on various levels of ab-
straction.
