ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999210142857143">
The structure imposed upon spoken sentences
by intonation seems frequently to be orthogo-
nal to their traditional surface-syntactic struc-
ture. However, the notion of &amp;quot;intonational struc-
ture&amp;quot; as formulated by Pierrehumbert, Selkirk,
and others, can be subsumed under a rather dif-
ferent notion of syntactic surface structure that
emerges from a theory of grammar based on a
&amp;quot;Combinatory&amp;quot; extension to Categotial Gram-
mar. Interpretations of constituents at this level
are in turn directly related to &amp;quot;information struc-
ture&amp;quot;, or discourse-related notions of &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;rheum&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;focus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;presupposition&amp;quot;. Some
simplifications appear to follow for the problem
of integrating syntax and other high-level mod-
ules in spoken language systems.
One quite normal prosody (b, below) for an answer
to the following question (a) intuitively imposes the
intonational structure indicated by the brackets (stress,
marked in this case by raised pitch, is indicated by
capitals):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.627514666666667">
(1) a. I know that Alice prefers velvet.
But what does MAry prefer?
b. (MA-ry prefers) (CORduroy).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9934856">
Such a grouping is orthogonal to the traditional syn-
tactic structure of the sentence.
Intonational structure nevertheless remains strongly
constrained by meaning. For example, contours im-
posing bracketings like the following are not allowed:

Halliday [6] observed that this constraint, which
Selkirk [14] has called the &amp;quot;Sense Unit Condition&amp;quot;,
seems to follow from the function of phrasal into-
nation, which is to convey what will here be called
&amp;quot;information structure&amp;quot; — that is, distinctions of focus,
presupposition, and propositional attitude towards en-
tities in the discourse model. These discourse entities
are more diverse than mere nounphrase or proposi-
tional referents, but they do not include such non-
concepts as &amp;quot;in ten prefer corduroy.&amp;quot;
Among the categories that they do include are what
Wilson and Sperber and E. Prince [13) have termed
&amp;quot;open propositions&amp;quot;. One way of introducing an open
proposition into the discourse context is by asking a
Wh-question. For example, the question in (1), What
does Mary prefer? introduces an open proposition.
As Jackendoff [7] pointed out, it is natural to think
of this open proposition as a functional abstraction,
and to express it as follows, using the notation of the
A-calculus:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978393">
(3) Ar [(prefer&apos; x) maryl
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996609666666667">
(Primes indicate semantic interpretations whose de-
tailed nature is of no direct concern here.) When
this function or concept is supplied with an argu-
ment corduroy&apos;, it reduces to give a proposition, with
the same function argument relations as the canonical
sentence:

It is the presence of the above open proposition rather
than some other that makes the intonation contour in
(1)b felicitous. (That is not to say that its presence
uniquely determines this response, nor that its explicit
mention is necessary for interpreting the response.)
These observations have led linguists such as
Selkirk to postulate a level of &amp;quot;intonational struc-
ture&amp;quot;, independent of syntactic structure and re-

The involvement of two apparently uncoupled lev-
els of structure in natural language grammar appears
to complicate the path from speech to interpretation
unreasonably, and to thereby threaten a number of
computational applications in speech recognition and
speech synthesis.
It is therefore interesting to observe that all natu-
ral languages include syntactic constructions whose
semantics is also reminiscent of functional abstrac-
tion. The most obvious and tractable class are Wh-
constructions themselves, in which exactly the same
fragments that can be delineated by a single intona-
tion contour appear as the residue of the subordinate
clause. Another and much more problematic class of
fragments results from coordinate constructions. It is
striking that the residues of wh-movement and con-
junction reduction are also subject to something like
a &amp;quot;sense unit condition&amp;quot;. For example, strings like
&amp;quot;in ten prefer corduroy&amp;quot; are not conjoinable:
(5) *Three cats in twenty like velvet,
and in ten prefer corduroy.
Since coordinate constructions have constituted an-
other major source of complexity for theories of nat-
ural language grammar, and also offer serious ob-
stacles to computational applications, it is tempt-
ing to think that this conspiracy between syntax and
prosody might point to a unified notion of structure
that is somewhat different from traditional surface
constituency.

COMBINATORY GRAMMARS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.74148525">
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, [16]) is an
extension of Categorial Grammar (CG). Elements like
verbs are associated with a syntactic &amp;quot;category&amp;quot; which
identifies them as functions, and specifies the type and
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.965386">

<bodyText confidence="0.998731833333333">
The category can be regarded as encoding the seman-
tic type of their translation, which in the notation used
here is identified by the expression to the right of the
colon. Such functions can combine with arguments
of the appropriate type and position by functional ap-
plication:

<bodyText confidence="0.999085375">
Because the syntactic types are identical to the se-
mantic types, apart form directionality, the deriva-
tion also builds a compositional interpretation,
(prefer&apos; corduroy&apos;) ?nary&apos;, and of course such a
&amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; categorial grammar is context free. Coordina-
tion might be included in CO via the following rule,
allowing constituents of like type to conjoin to yield
a single constituent of the same type:

<bodyText confidence="0.999912285714286">
(The rest of the derivation is omitted, being the same
as in (7).) In order to allow coordination of con-
tiguous strings that do not constitute constituents,
CCG generalises the grammar to allow certain op-
erations on functions related to Curry&apos;s cornbinators
[3]. For example, functions may nondeterministically
compose, as well as apply, under the following rule:

<bodyText confidence="0.99135425">
The most important single property of combinatory
rules like this is that they have an invariant semantics.
This one composes the interpretations of the functions
that it applies to, as is apparent from the right hand
side of the rule.&apos; Thus sentences like I suggested,
Lille rule uses the notation of the ,\-calculus in the semantics,
for clarity. This should not obscure the fact that it is functional
composition itself that is the primitive, not the A operator.

and would prefer, corduroy can be accepted, via the
following composition of two verbs (indexed as B,
following Curry&apos;s nomenclature) to yield a composite
of the same category as a transitive verb. Crucially,
composition also yields the appropriate interpretation
for the composite verb would prefer:

Combinatory grammars also include type-raising
rules, which turn arguments into functions over
functions-over-such-arguments. These rules allow ar-
guments to compose, and thereby take part in coordi-
nations like I suggested, and Mary prefers, corduroy.
They too have an invariant compositional semantics
which ensures that the result has an appropriate inter-
pretation. For example, the following rule allows the
conjuncts to form as below (again, the remainder of
the derivation is omitted):

Examples like the above show that combinatory gram-
mars embody a view of surface structure according
to which strings like Mary prefers are constituents. It
follows, according to this view, that they must also be
possible constituents of non-coordinate sentences like

(See [9], [18] and [19] for a discussion of the ob-
vious problems for parsing written text that the pres-
ence of such &amp;quot;spurious&amp;quot; (i.e. semantically equivalent)
derivations engenders, and for some ways they might
be overcome.) An entirely unconstrained combina-
tory grammar would in fact allow any bracketing on
a sentence, although the grammars we actually write
for configurational languages like English are heavily
constrained by local conditions. (An example might
be a condition on the composition rule that is tacitly
assumed below, forbidding the variable Y in the com-
position rule to be instantiated as NP, thus excluding
constituents like *[ate ihejv poi).
The claim of the present paper is simply that par-
ticular surface structures that are induced by the spe-
cific combinatory grammar that are postulated to ex-
plain coordination in English subsume the intona-
tional structures that are postulated by Pierrehumbert
et al. to explain the possible intonation contours for
sentences of English. More specifically, the claim is
that that in spoken utterance, intonation helps to de-
termine which of the many possible bracketings per-
mitted by the combinatory syntax of English is in-
tended, and that the interpretations of the constituents
that arise from these derivations, far from being &amp;quot;spu-
rious&amp;quot;, are related to distinctions of discourse focus
among the concepts and open propositions that the
speaker has in mind.
The proof of this claim lies in showing that the
rules of combinatory grammar can be made sensitive
to intonation contour, which limit their application in
spoken discourse. We must also show that the major
constituents of intonated utterances like (1)b, under
the analyses that are permitted by any given intona-
tion, correspond to the information structure of the
context to which the intonation is appropriate, as in
(a) in the example (1) with which the paper begins.
This demonstration will be quite simple, once we have
established the following notation for intonation con-
tours.
I shall use a notation which is based on the theory
of Pierrehumbert [10], as modified in more recent
work by Selkirk [14], Beckman and Pierrehumbert
[1], [11], and Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg [12]. I

Fred and the beans receive a pitch accent, but a dif-

by an L boundary. There is another prosodic phrase
having the pitch accent called L+1.1* on beans, pre-
ceded by null or interpolated tone on the words ate

is written LH %. (I base these annotations on Pierre-
humbert and Hirschberg&apos;s [12, ex. 33] discussion of
this example.)3 In the second example (16) above, the

5The concepts of theme and theme are closely related to Grosz
at al&apos;s [5] concepts of &amp;quot;backward looking center&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;forward
looking center&amp;quot;.
6Here I depart slightly from Halliday&apos;s definition. The present
paper also follows Lyons [81 in rejecting Hallidays&apos; claim that the
theme must necessarily be sentence-initial.

fined to Fred, seems equally coherent, and may be the one intended

discourse is Fred or What Fred ate. It too is accepted by the mles
below.
gNote that the position of the pitch accent in the phrase has to
do with a limber dimension of information structure within both
theme and theme, which me might identify as &amp;quot;focus&amp;quot;. I ignore
this dimension here.
2For the purposes of this abstract, I am ignoring the distinction 12
between the intonational phrase proper, and what Pierrehumben
and her colleagues call the &amp;quot;intermediate&amp;quot; phrase, which differ in
respect of boundary tone-sequences.

matical constituent, complete with a translation equiv-
alent to the open proposition AxRate&apos; fren The
combinatory theory thus offers a way to derive such
intonational phrases, using only the independently
motivated rules of combinatory grammar, entirely un-
der the control of appropriate intonation contours like
L+H* LH%.9
It is extremely simple to make the existing combi-
natory grammar do this. We interpret the two pitch
accents as functions over boundaries, of the following
types :1°
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.84174">
(17) L+H* := Theme /Bh
H* := Rheme /B1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999760666666667">
— that is, as functions over boundary tones into the
two major informational types, the Hallidean &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;rheme&amp;quot;. The reader may wonder at this point
why we do not replace the category Theme by a
functional category, say Utterance/Rheme, cor-
responding to its semantic type. The answer is that
we do not want this category to combine with any-
thing but a complete rheme. In particular, it must not
combine with a function into the category Rheme
by functional composition. Accordingly we give it
a non-functional category, and supply the following
special purpose prosodic combinatory rules:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.702643">
(18) Theme Rheme Utterance
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.548088">

<bodyText confidence="0.9998935">
We next define the various boundary tones as ar-
guments to these functions, as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.937771333333333">
(19) LH% := Bh
LL% := El
L El
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.97591947826087">
(As usual, we ignore for present purposes the distinc-
tion between intermediate- and intonational- phrase
boundaries.) Finally, we accomplish the effect of in-
terpolation of other parts of the tune by assigning the
following polymorphic category to all elements bear-
ing no tone specification, which we will represent as
the tone 0:
Syntactic combination can then be made subject to
the following simple restriction:
(21) The Prosodic Constituent Condition: Com-
bination of two syntactic categories via a
syntactic combinatory rule is only allowed if
their prosodic categories can also combine.
(The prosodic and syntactic combinatory rules need
not be the same).
This principle has the sole effect of excluding cer-
tain derivations for spoken utterances that would be
allowed for the equivalent written sentences. For ex-
ample, consider the derivations that it permits for ex-
ample (16) above. The rule of forward composition is
allowed to apply to the words Fred and ate, because
the prosodic categories can combine (by functional
application):

The category X/x of the null tone allows intonational
phrasal tunes like L-I-H* LH% tune to spread across

The division of the utterance into an open proposition
constituting the theme and an argument constituting
the rheme is appropriate to the context established in
(16). Moreover, the theory permits no other deriva-
tion for this intonation contour. Of course, repeated
application of the composition rule, as in (23), would
allow the L+H* LH% contour to spread further, as in
(FRED must have eatenXthe BEANS).
In contrast, the parallel derivation is forbidden by

No other analysis is allowed for (25). Again, the
derivation divides the sentence into new and given in-
formation consistent with the context given in the ex-
ample. The effect of the derivation is to annotate the
entire predicate as an L+H* LH%. It is emphasised
that this does not mean that the tone is spread, but that
the whole constituent is marked for the corresponding
discourse function — roughly, as contrastive given,
or theme. The finer grain information that it is the ob-
ject that is contrasted, while the verb is given, resides
in the tree itself. Similarly, the fact that boundary se-
quences are associated with words at the lowest level
of the derivation does not mean that they are part
of the word, CIF specified in the lexicon, nor that the
word is the entity that they are a boundary of. It is
prosodic phrases that they bound, and these also are
defined by the tree.
All the other possibilities for combining these two
contours on this sentence are shown elsewhere [17]
to yield similarly unique and contextually appropriate
interpretations.
Sentences like the above, including marked
theme and rheme expressed as two distinct intona-
tional/intermediate phrases are by that token unam-
biguous as to their information structure. However,
sentences him the following, which in Pierrehum-
berts terms bear a single intonational phrase, are
much more ambiguous as to the division that they
convey between theme and rheme:

tional contour can be identified in isolation from word
recognition.12
What the isomorphism between syntactic structure
and intonational structure does mean is that simply
structured modular processors which use both sources
of information at once can be more easily devised.
Such an architecture may reasonably be expected to
simplify the problem of resolving local structural am-
biguity in both domains. For example, a syntactic
analysis that is so closely related to the structure of
the signal should be easier to use to &amp;quot;filter&amp;quot; the am-
biguities arising from lexical recognition.
However, it is probably more important that the
constituents that arise under this analysis are also
semantically interpreted. The interpretations are di-
rectly related to the concepts, referents and themes
that have been established in the context of discourse,
say as the result of a question. These discourse en-
tities are in turn directly reducible to the structures
involved in knowledge-representation and inference.
The direct path from speech to these higher levels of
analysis offered by the present theory should therefore
make it possible to use more effectively the much
more powerful resources of semantics and domain-
specific knowledge, including knowledge of the dis-
course, to filter low-level ambiguities, using larger
grammars of a more expressive class than is cur-
rently possible. While vast improvements in purely
bottom-up word recognition can be expected to con-
tinue, such filtering is likely to remain crucial to suc-
cessful speech processing by machine, and appears to
be characteristic of all levels of human processing,
for both spoken and written language.

<abstract confidence="0.968334497844828">The structure imposed upon spoken sentences by intonation seems frequently to be orthogonal to their traditional surface-syntactic structure. However, the notion of &amp;quot;intonational structure&amp;quot; as formulated by Pierrehumbert, Selkirk, and others, can be subsumed under a rather different notion of syntactic surface structure that emerges from a theory of grammar based on a &amp;quot;Combinatory&amp;quot; extension to Categotial Grammar. Interpretations of constituents at this level are in turn directly related to &amp;quot;information structure&amp;quot;, or discourse-related notions of &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rheum&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;focus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;presupposition&amp;quot;. Some simplifications appear to follow for the problem of integrating syntax and other high-level modules in spoken language systems. normal prosody (b, below) for an answer to the following question (a) intuitively imposes the intonational structure indicated by the brackets (stress, marked in this case by raised pitch, is indicated by capitals): (1) a. I know that Alice prefers velvet. But what does MAry prefer? b. (MA-ry prefers) (CORduroy). a grouping is orthogonal to syntactic structure of the sentence. Intonational structure nevertheless remains strongly constrained by meaning. For example, contours imposing bracketings like the following are not allowed: (2) #(Three cats)(in ten prefer corduroy) •I am grateful to Steven Bird, Julia Hirschberg, Aravind Joshi, Mitch Marcus, Janet Pierrehumbert, and Bonnie Lynn Webber for comments and advice- They are not to blame for any errors in the translation of their advice into the present form. The research was supported by DARPA grant no. NO014-85-0018, and ARO grant no. DAAL03-89-00031. Halliday [6] observed that this constraint, which Selkirk [14] has called the &amp;quot;Sense Unit Condition&amp;quot;, to follow from the phrasal intonation, which is to convey what will here be called &amp;quot;information structure&amp;quot; — that is, distinctions of focus, presupposition, and propositional attitude towards entities in the discourse model. These discourse entities are more diverse than mere nounphrase or propositional referents, but they do not include such nonconcepts as &amp;quot;in ten prefer corduroy.&amp;quot; the categories that they are what Wilson and Sperber and E. Prince [13) have termed &amp;quot;open propositions&amp;quot;. One way of introducing an open proposition into the discourse context is by asking a For example, the question in (1), Mary prefer? an open proposition. As Jackendoff [7] pointed out, it is natural to think this open proposition as a functional and to express it as follows, using the notation of the A-calculus: Ar x) maryl (Primes indicate semantic interpretations whose detailed nature is of no direct concern here.) When this function or concept is supplied with an argugive a proposition, with the same function argument relations as the canonical sentence: (4) (prefer&apos; corduroy&apos;) maryi is the of the above open proposition rather than some other that makes the intonation contour in (1)b felicitous. (That is not to say that its presence response, nor that its explicit mention is necessary for interpreting the response.) These observations have led linguists such as Selkirk to postulate a level of &amp;quot;intonational strucindependent structure and re- 9 lated to information structure. The theory that results can be viewed as in Figure 1: directionality of their arguments and the type of their result: I: of Standard Metrical Phonology The involvement of two apparently uncoupled levels of structure in natural language grammar appears to complicate the path from speech to interpretation unreasonably, and to thereby threaten a number of computational applications in speech recognition and speech synthesis. It is therefore interesting to observe that all natural languages include syntactic constructions whose semantics is also reminiscent of functional abstraction. The most obvious and tractable class are Whconstructions themselves, in which exactly the same that delineated by intonation contour appear as the residue of the subordinate clause. Another and much more problematic class of fragments results from coordinate constructions. It is striking that the residues of wh-movement and conjunction reduction are also subject to something like a &amp;quot;sense unit condition&amp;quot;. For example, strings like &amp;quot;in ten prefer corduroy&amp;quot; are not conjoinable: (5) *Three cats in twenty like velvet, and in ten prefer corduroy. Since coordinate constructions have constituted another major source of complexity for theories of natlanguage grammar, offer serious obstacles to computational applications, it is tempting to think that this conspiracy between syntax and prosody might point to a unified notion of structure that is somewhat different from traditional surface constituency. Categorial Grammar (CCG, an extension of Categorial Grammar (CG). Elements like verbs are associated with a syntactic &amp;quot;category&amp;quot; which them as specifies the type and (6) prefers := (SV V P)IN P : prefer&apos; The category can be regarded as encoding the semantic type of their translation, which in the notation used here is identified by the expression to the right of the colon. Such functions can combine with arguments of the appropriate type and position by functional application: (7) Nary prefers corduroy NP (S\NP)/NP NP S\HP Because the syntactic types are identical to the semantic types, apart form directionality, the derivation also builds a compositional interpretation, corduroy&apos;) ?nary&apos;, of course such a &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; categorial grammar is context free. Coordination might be included in CO via the following rule, allowing constituents of like type to conjoin to yield a single constituent of the same type: (8) X conj X X 1 and detest velvet (s\NP)/IP colj (S\WP)/BPIP (S\NP)/NP (The rest of the derivation is omitted, being the same as in (7).) In order to allow coordination of contiguous strings that do not constitute constituents, CCG generalises the grammar to allow certain operations on functions related to Curry&apos;s cornbinators [3]. For example, functions may nondeterministically well as apply, under the following rule: (10) Forward Composition: : F YIZ :G : The most important single property of combinatory rules like this is that they have an invariant semantics. This one composes the interpretations of the functions that it applies to, as is apparent from the right hand of the rule.&apos; Thus sentences like suggested, Lille rule uses the notation of the ,\-calculus in the semantics, for clarity. This should not obscure the fact that it is functional composition itself that is the primitive, not the A operator. LF:Argument Structure Surface Structure Phonological Form LF:Information Structure Intonational Structure 10 would prefer, corduroy be accepted, via the composition of two verbs (indexed as following Curry&apos;s nomenclature) to yield a composite of the same category as a transitive verb. Crucially, composition also yields the appropriate interpretation the composite verb prefer: (11) suggested and you&apos;d prefer (S\HP)/NP con] (S\NP)/VP VP/HP &gt;B (S\NP)/NP (S\HP)/NP Combinatory grammars also include type-raising rules, which turn arguments into functions over functions-over-such-arguments. These rules allow arguments to compose, and thereby take part in coordilike suggested, and Mary prefers, corduroy. too have an semantics which ensures that the result has an appropriate interpretation. For example, the following rule allows the conjuncts to form as below (again, the remainder of the derivation is omitted): (12) Subject Type-raising: NP : y .51(5\N P): Fy (13) I suggested and Mary prefers Op)/op cold op (s\ op) Op ›T S/(SVP) SgS\IP) 7B iB SOP SOP 2 slop This apparatus has been applied to a wide variety of phenomena (cf. [4], INTONATION AND CONTEXT Examples like the above show that combinatory grammars embody a view of surface structure according which strings like prefers constituents. follows, according to this view, that they must also be possible constituents of non-coordinate sentences like prefers corduroy, as in following derivation: (14) Mary prefers corduroy NP (S NP) /HP Hp &gt;1&apos; SASVIP) &gt;11 S/NP (See [9], [18] and [19] for a discussion of the obvious problems for parsing written text that the presof such &amp;quot;spurious&amp;quot; (i.e. derivations engenders, and for some ways they might be overcome.) An entirely unconstrained combinatory grammar would in fact allow any bracketing on a sentence, although the grammars we actually write for configurational languages like English are heavily constrained by local conditions. (An example might be a condition on the composition rule that is tacitly assumed below, forbidding the variable Y in the composition rule to be instantiated as NP, thus excluding like The claim of the present paper is simply that particular surface structures that are induced by the specific combinatory grammar that are postulated to explain coordination in English subsume the intonational structures that are postulated by Pierrehumbert al. explain the possible intonation contours for sentences of English. More specifically, the claim is spoken utterance, intonation helps to dethe many possible bracketings permitted by the combinatory syntax of English is intended, and that the interpretations of the constituents that arise from these derivations, far from being &amp;quot;spurious&amp;quot;, are related to distinctions of discourse focus among the concepts and open propositions that the speaker has in mind. The proof of this claim lies in showing that the rules of combinatory grammar can be made sensitive to intonation contour, which limit their application in spoken discourse. We must also show that the major constituents of intonated utterances like (1)b, under the analyses that are permitted by any given intonation, correspond to the information structure of the context to which the intonation is appropriate, as in (a) in the example (1) with which the paper begins. This demonstration will be quite simple, once we have established the following notation for intonation contours. I shall use a notation which is based on the theory of Pierrehumbert [10], as modified in more recent work by Selkirk [14], Beckman and Pierrehumbert [11], and Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg [12]. U. have tried as far as possible to take my examples and the associated intonational annotations from those au-thors. The theory proposed below is in principle com-patible with any of the standard descriptive accounts of phrasal intonation. However, a crucial feature of Pierrehumberts theory for present purposes is that it distinguishes two subcomponents of the prosodic the accent the The first of these tones or tone-sequences coincides with the perceived major stress or stresses of the prosodic phrase, while the second marks the righthand bound-ary of the phrase. These two components are essen-tially invariant, and all other pans of the intonational tune are interpolated. Pierrehumberts theory thus cap-tures in a very natural way the intuition that the same can spread over longer or shorter strings, in order to mark the corresponding constituents for the particular distinction of focus and propositional atti-tude that the melody denotes. It will help the exposi-tion to augment Pierrehumberts notation with explicit prosodic phrase boundaries, using brackets. These do not change her theory in any way: all the information is implicit in the original notation. two tunes are reverse&amp; this time the tune with pitch accent L+H* and boundary LH% is spread across a phrase ate, the other tune with accent Ha and LL% carried by the phrase beans (again an inor null Consider for example the prosody of the sentence ate the beans the following pair of discourse are adapted from Jackendoff [7, pp. 260]: The meaning that these tunes convey is intuitively very obvious. As Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg point out, the latter tune seems to be used to mark some or all of that part of the sentence expressing information the speaker believes to be to the hearer. traditional terms, it marks the &amp;quot;comment&amp;quot; — more pre-cisely, what Halliday called the &amp;quot;Theme&amp;quot;. In contrast, L+H* seems to be used to mark some or all of that part of the sentence which expresses in-formation which in traditional terms is the &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; — Halliday&apos;s terms, the For present pur-poses, a theme can be thought of as conveying what the speaker assumes to be the subject of mutual interthis particular tune marks a theme novel the conversation as a whole, as standing in a contrastive relation to the previous one. (If the is not novel in this sense, it receives in Pierrehumbert&apos;s terms, and may even be left out Thus in (16), the inthis accent is across the phrase Similarly, in (15), the same tune is confined to object of the open proposition the beans, be-cause the intonation of the original question indicates eating beans opposed to some other comestible the new (15) Q: Well, what about the BEins?

In the former example, (15), there is a phrase on up of the pitch accent which Pierrehumbert calls Ha, immediately followed by an L boundary. There is another prosodic phrase the pitch accent called L+1.1* on preby null or interpolated tone on the words immediately followed by a boundary which written %. (I these annotations Pierre- Hirschberg&apos;s [12, ex. 33] discussion of In the second example (16) above, the reason for notating the latter boundary as LIA, rather than L is again to do with the distinction between intonational and in-termediate phrases. concepts of theme and theme are closely related to Grosz at al&apos;s [5] concepts of &amp;quot;backward looking center&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;forward looking center&amp;quot;.

The present paper also follows Lyons [81 in rejecting Hallidays&apos; claim that the theme must necessarily be sentence-initial. 7An ahemative prosody, in which the contrastive time is conto equally coherent, and may be the one intended by Iackendoff.

I ignore this dimension here. purposes of this abstract, I am ignoring the distinction between the intonational phrase proper, and what Pierrehumben and her colleagues call the &amp;quot;intermediate&amp;quot; phrase, which differ in respect of boundary tone-sequences. 12 to gloss over Pierrehumbert&apos;s distinction between termediate&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;intonational&amp;quot; phrases. matical constituent, complete with a translation equivto the open proposition AxRate&apos; combinatory theory thus offers a way to derive such intonational phrases, using only the independently motivated rules of combinatory grammar, entirely under the control of appropriate intonation contours like extremely simple to make the existing combinatory grammar do this. We interpret the two pitch accents as functions over boundaries, of the following (17) L+H* := Theme /Bh H* := Rheme /B1 — that is, as functions over boundary tones into the two major informational types, the Hallidean &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;rheme&amp;quot;. The reader may wonder at this point we do not replace the category a say corresponding to its semantic type. The answer is that we do not want this category to combine with anybut a In particular, it must not combine with a function into the category Rheme by functional composition. Accordingly we give it a non-functional category, and supply the following special purpose prosodic combinatory rules: (18) Theme Rheme Utterance Rheme Theme Utterance We next define the various boundary tones as arguments to these functions, as follows: (19) LH% := Bh LL% := El L El (As usual, we ignore for present purposes the distincintermediateand intonationalphrase boundaries.) Finally, we accomplish the effect of interpolation of other parts of the tune by assigning the following polymorphic category to all elements bearing no tone specification, which we will represent as the tone 0: Syntactic combination can then be made subject to the following simple restriction: The Prosodic Constituent Condition: Combination of two syntactic categories via a syntactic combinatory rule is only allowed if prosodic categories can (The prosodic and syntactic combinatory rules need not be the same). This principle has the sole effect of excluding certain derivations for spoken utterances that would be allowed for the equivalent written sentences. For example, consider the derivations that it permits for example (16) above. The rule of forward composition is to apply to the words ate, because the prosodic categories can combine (by functional application): Fred L+11* NP:fred&apos; Theme/Rh &gt;T \NF) : Theme/Bh &gt;13 S/NP: XX[(ate) X) fredq Theme category X/x the null tone allows intonational tunes tune to spread across that forms a grammatical constituent according to the combinatory grammar. For example, the reply to the same question did Fred eat? must have eaten the BEANS, the tune typically be spread over must have eaten ..., in the following (incomplete) which much of the syntactic and semantic detail has been omitted in the interests of brevity: Fred must eaten 1.441* LH%) NP (S\NP)/VP VP/VPen VPen/NP Theme/Bh X/X X/X Bh ›T Theme/Bh • • ) Bh am grateful to Steven Bird for discussions on the following proposal. &apos;An alternative (which would actually be closer to Pierrehumbelt and Hirschberg&apos;s own proposal to compositionally assemble discourse meanings from more primitive elements of meaning carried by each individual tone) would be to make the boundary tone the function and the pitch accent an argument. &gt;B Theme/Bh &gt;5 Theme The rest of the derivation of (16) is completed as follows, using the first rule in ex. (18): &gt;13 (20) 0 := x/x Theme/Bh 13 the beans )( IP/N: the&apos; Theme/Bit Bit I/I Rhemm &gt;I Rheme Theme/Bh &gt;ES Theme I. ate&apos; (the&apos; beans&apos;) Utterance The division of the utterance into an open proposition constituting the theme and an argument constituting the rheme is appropriate to the context established in Moreover, the theory permits no derivation for this intonation contour. Of course, repeated application of the composition rule, as in (23), would allow the L+H* LH% contour to spread further, as in (FRED must have eatenXthe BEANS). In contrast, the parallel derivation is forbidden by the prosodic constituent condition for the alternative intonation contour on (15). Instead, the following derivation, excluded for the previous example, is now allowed: ate the beans Rs L C 1.14 ) (S\IP)//Plate&amp;quot; Rheas I/I I/I The.. 1P[P fredq Theme Rheas S\IP:eatqthe beans&apos;) Theme beans&apos;) fred&apos; Utterance No other analysis is allowed for (25). Again, the derivation divides the sentence into new and given information consistent with the context given in the example. The effect of the derivation is to annotate the entire predicate as an L+H* LH%. It is emphasised this does mean that the tone spread, but that the whole constituent is marked for the corresponding discourse function — roughly, as contrastive given, or theme. The finer grain information that it is the object that is contrasted, while the verb is given, resides in the tree itself. Similarly, the fact that boundary sequences are associated with words at the lowest level the derivation does not mean that they part word, in the lexicon, nor that the is the entity that they are a boundary It is prosodic phrases that they bound, and these also are defined by the tree. All the other possibilities for combining these two contours on this sentence are shown elsewhere [17] to yield similarly unique and contextually appropriate interpretations. Sentences like the above, including marked theme and rheme expressed as two distinct intonational/intermediate phrases are by that token unambiguous as to their information structure. However, sentences him the following, which in Pierrehumberts terms bear a single intonational phrase, are much more ambiguous as to the division that they between theme rheme: (26) I read a book about CORduroy 14* IAL% ) Such a sentence is notoriously ambiguous as to the open proposition it presupposes, for it seems equally apropriate as a response to any of the following questions: (27) a. What did you read a book about? b. What did you read? c. What did you do? Such questions could in suitably contrastive contexts rise to themes marked by the LH% bracketing the sentence as follows: read a book about)(CORduroy) b. (I read)(a book about CORduroy) c. (IXread a book about CORduroy) It seems that we shall miss a generalisation concerning the relation of intonation to discourse information unless we extend Pierrehumberts theory very slightly, allow phrases, without pitch accents, expressing unmarked themes. Since the boundaries of such intermediate phrases are not explicitly marked, we shall immediately allow all of the above analyses for (26). Such a modification to the theory can be introduced by the following rule, which nonallows certain bearing the null tone to become a theme: (29) E = The symbol E is a variable ranging over syntactic categories that are (leftwardor rightwardlooking) 3.4 into The rule is nondeterministic, so it correctly continues to allow a further analysis of the entire sentence as a single Intonational Phrase convey-ing the Rheme. Such an utterance is the appropriate response to yet another open-proposition establishing What turn reduce via functional application to yield canon-ical function-argument structure, or &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot;. With this generalisation, we are in a position to make the following claim: There may be significant advantages for automatic spoken language understanding in such a theory. Most obviously, where in the past parsing and phono-logical processing have tended to deliver conflicting structural analyses, and have had to be pursued inde-pendently, they now are seen to be in concert. That is to say that intonational all local struc-tural ambiguity. Nor should the problem of recognis-ing cues like boundary tones be underestimated, for acoustic realisation in the fundamental the intonational tunes discussed above is en-tirely dependent upon the rest of the phonology — that is, upon the phonemes and words that bear the tune. It therefore seems most unlikely that intona-tional contour can be identified in isolation from word (30) The structures demanded by the theory of in-tonation and its relation to contextual infor-mation are the same as the surface syntac-tic structures permitted by the combinatory grammar. What the isomorphism between syntactic structure intonational structure mean that simply structured modular processors which use both sources of information at once can be more easily devised. Such an architecture may reasonably be expected to simplify the problem of resolving local structural am-biguity in both domains. For example, a syntactic analysis that is so closely related to the structure of the signal should be easier to use to &amp;quot;filter&amp;quot; the am-biguities arising from lexical recognition. A number of corollaries follow, such as the following: However, it is probably more important that the constituents that arise under this analysis are also semantically interpreted. The interpretations are direlated to the concepts, referents and that have been established in the context of discourse, say as the result of a question. These discourse en-tities are in turn directly reducible to the structures involved in knowledge-representation and inference. The direct path from speech to these higher levels of analysis offered by the present theory should therefore make it possible to use more effectively the much more powerful resources of semantics and domain-specific knowledge, including knowledge of the dis-course, to filter low-level ambiguities, using larger grammars of a more expressive class than is curpossible. While vast improvements in bottom-up word recognition can be expected to con-tinue, such filtering is likely to remain crucial to suc-cessful speech processing by machine, and appears to be characteristic of all levels of human processing, for both spoken and written language. (31) Anything which can coordinate can be an constituent, and versa.</abstract>

<note confidence="0.898599588235294">Such an architecture is considerably simpler than the one shown earlier in Figure 1. Phonological form maps via the rules of combinatory grammar directly onto a surface structure, whose highest level con-stituents correspond to intonational constituents, an-notated as to their discourse function. Surface struc-ture therefore subsumes intonational structure. It also subsumes information structure, since the translations of those surface constituents correspond to the enti-ties and open propositions which constitute the topic or theme (if any) and the comment or theme. These in &amp;quot;The inclusion in the full grammar of further rules of type-raising in addition to the subject rule discussed above means that the set of categories over which E ranges is larger than it is possible to reveal in the pre-sent paper. (For example, it includes object complements). See the earlier papers and [17] for discussion. 15 is no bad thing. The converse also applies: intonation contour effects the acoustic realisation of words, particularly with respect to timing. it is therefore likely that the benefits of combinrecognition and recognition will be mutual.

They too have an invariant compositional semantics which ensures that the result has an appropriate interpretation. For example, the following rule allows the conjuncts to form as below (again, the remainder of the derivation is omitted): (12) Subject Type-raising: NP : y .51(5\N P): Fy (13) I suggested and Mary prefers IP CS Op)/op cold op (s\ op) Op ›T S/(SVP) SgS\IP) 7B iB SOP SOP 2 slop This apparatus has been applied to a wide variety of coordination phenomena (cf. [4], [15]). INTONATION AND CONTEXT Examples like the above show that combinatory grammars embody a view of surface structure according to which strings like Mary prefers are constituents.

For example, strings like &amp;quot;in ten prefer corduroy&amp;quot; are not conjoinable: (5) *Three cats in twenty like velvet, and in ten prefer corduroy. Since coordinate constructions have constituted another major source of complexity for theories of natural language grammar, and also offer serious obstacles to computational applications, it is tempting to think that this conspiracy between syntax and prosody might point to a unified notion of structure that is somewhat different from traditional surface constituency. COMBINATORY GRAMMARS. Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, [16]) is an extension of Categorial Grammar (CG). Elements like verbs are associated with a syntactic &amp;quot;category&amp;quot; which identifies them as functions, and specifies the type and (6) prefers := (SV V P)IN P : prefer&apos; The category can be regarded as encoding the semantic type of their translation, which in the notation used here is identified by the expression to the right of the colon. Such functions can combine with arguments of the appropriate type and position by functional application: (7) Nary prefers corduroy NP (S\NP)/NP NP S\HP Because the syntactic types are identical to the semantic types, </context>

The finer grain information that it is the object that is contrasted, while the verb is given, resides in the tree itself. Similarly, the fact that boundary sequences are associated with words at the lowest level of the derivation does not mean that they are part of the word, CIF specified in the lexicon, nor that the word is the entity that they are a boundary of. It is prosodic phrases that they bound, and these also are defined by the tree. All the other possibilities for combining these two contours on this sentence are shown elsewhere [17] to yield similarly unique and contextually appropriate interpretations. Sentences like the above, including marked theme and rheme expressed as two distinct intonational/intermediate phrases are by that token unambiguous as to their information structure. However, sentences him the following, which in Pierrehumberts terms bear a single intonational phrase, are much more ambiguous as to the division that they convey between theme and rheme: (26) I read a book about CORduroy 14* IAL% ) Such a sentence is notoriously ambiguous as to the open proposition it presupposes, for it seems equally aprop</context>
