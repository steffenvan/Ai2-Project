<bodyText confidence="0.999937035714286">
Much effort has been put into computational lex-
icons over the years, and most systems give much
room to (lexical) semantic data. However, in these
systems, the effort put on the study and representa-
tion of lexical items to express the underlying contin-
uum existing in 1) language vagueness and polysemy,
and 2) language gaps and mismatches, has remained
embryonic. A sense enumeration approach fails from
a theoretical point of view to capture the core mean-
ing of words, let alone relate word meanings to one
another, and complicates the task of NLP by multi-
plying ambiguities in analysis and choices in genera-
tion. In this paper, I study computational semantic
lexicon representation from a multilingual point of
view, reconciling different approaches to lexicon rep-
resentation: i) vagueness for lexemes which have a
more or less finer grained semantics with respect to
other languages; ii) underspecification for lexemes
which have multiple related facets; and, iii) lexi-
cal rules to relate systematic polysemy to systematic
ambiguity. I build on a What You See Is Not Neces-
sarily What You Get (WYSINNWYG) approach to
provide the NLP system with the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; lexical data
already tuned towards a particular task. In order to
do so, I argue for a lexical semantic approach to lex-
icon representation. I exemplify my study through
a cross-linguistic investigation on spatially-based ex-
pressions.

1 A Cross-linguistic Investigation on
Spatially-based Expressions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780535714286">
In this paper, I argue for computational seman-
tic lexicons as active knowledge sources in or-
der to provide Natural Language Processing (NLP)
systems with the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; lexical semantic represen-
tation to accomplish a particular task. In other
words, lexicon entries are &amp;quot;pre-digested&amp;quot;, via a lex-
ical processor, to best fit an NLP task. This
What You See (in your lexicon) Is Not Necessarily
What You Get (as input to your program) (WYSIN-
NWYG) approach requires the adoption of a sym-
bolic paradigm. Formally, I use a combination
of three different approaches to lexicon represen-
tations: (1) lexico-semantic vagueness, for lexemes
which have a more or less finer grained semantics
with respect to other languages (for instance en in
Spanish is vague between the Contact and Container
senses of the Location, whereas in English it is finer
grained, with on for the former and in for the lat-
ter); (2) lexico-semantic underspecification, for lex-
emes which have multiple related facets (such as for
instance, door which is underspecified with respect
to its Aperture or PhysicalObject meanings); and,
(3) lexical rules, to relate systematic polysemy to
systematic ambiguity (such as the Food Or Animal
rule for lamb).
I illustrate the WYSINNWYG approach via a
cross-linguistic investigation (English, French, Span-
ish) on spatially-based expressions, as lexicalised,
for instance, in the prepositions in, above, on, .
verbs traverser, (&amp;quot;go&amp;quot; across) in French, predicative
nouns montee, (going up) in French, or in adjec-
tives upright. Processing spatially-based expressions
in a multilingual environment is a difficult problem
as these lexemes exhibit a high degree of polysemy
(in particular for prepositions) and of language gaps
(i.e., when there is not a one-to-one mapping be-
tween languages, whatever the linguistic level; lex-
ical, semantic, syntactic, etc). Therefore, process-
ing these expressions or words in a multilingual en-
vironment minimally involves having a solution for
treating: (a) syntactic divergences, swim across —&gt;
traverser a la nage in French (cross ... swim-
ming); (b) semantic mismatches, river translates
into fleuve, riviere in French; and (c), cases which lie
in between clear-cut cases of language gaps (stand -4
se tenir debout/se tenir, lie -4 se tenir allonge/se
tenir). Researchers have dealt with a) and/or b),
whereas WYSINNWYG presents a uniform treat-
ment of a), b) and c), by allowing words to have
their meanings vary in context.
In this paper, I restrict my cross-linguistic study
to the (lexical) semantics of words with a fo-
cus on spatially-based expressions, and consider lit-
eral or non-figurative meanings only. In the next
sections, I address representational problems which
must be solved in order to best capture the phenom-

ena of ambiguity, polysemy and language gaps from
a lexical semantic viewpoint. I then present three
different ways of capturing the phenomena: lexico-
semantic vagueness, lexico-semantic underspecifica-
tion and lexical rules.

1.1 The Language Gap Problem
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999835352941177">
Upon a close examination of empirical data, it is
often difficult to classify a translation pair as a syn-
tactic divergence (e.g., Dorr, 1990; Levin and Niren-
burg, 1993), as in he limped up the stairs —&gt; ii monta
les marches en boitant (French) (he went up the
stairs limping) or a semantic mismatch (e.g., Palmer
and Zhibiao, 1995; Kameyama et al., 1991), as in lie,
stand -4 se tenir (French). Moreover, lie and stand
could be translated as se tenir couche/allonge (be
lying) and se tenir debout (be up) respectively, thus
presenting a case of divergence, or they could both
be translated into French as se tenir, thus present-
ing a case of conflation, (Talmy, 1985). Depending
on the semantics of the first argument, one might
want to generate the divergence, (e.g., se tenir de-
bout/couche), or not (e.g., se tenir), thus considering
se tenir as a mismatch as in (1):

<bodyText confidence="0.999975363636364">
In order to account for all these language varia-
tions, one cannot &amp;quot;freeze&amp;quot; the meanings of language
pairs. In section 2.1, I show that by adopting a con-
tinuum perspective, that is using a knowledge-based
approach where I make the distinction between
lexical and semantic knowledge, cases in between
syntactic divergences and semantic mismatches (se
tenir) can be accounted for in a uniform way. Prac-
tically, the proposed method can be applied to in-
terlingua approaches and transfer approaches, when
these latter encode a layer of semantic information.

1.2 The Lexicon Representation Problem
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.929831676470588">
Within the paradigm of knowledge-based ap-
proaches, there are still lexicon representation issues
to be addressed in order to treat these language gaps.
It has been well documented in the literature of this
past decade that a sense enumeration approach fails
from a theoretical point of view to capture the core
meaning of words (e.g., (Ostler and Atkins, 1992),
(Boguraev and Pustejovsky, 1990),...) and compli-
cates from a practical viewpoint the task of NLP by
multiplying ambiguities in analysis and choices in
generation.
Within Machine Translation (MT), this approach
has led researchers to &amp;quot;add&amp;quot; ambiguity in a lan-
guage which did not have it from a monolingual
perspective. Ambiguity is added at the lexical
level within transfer based approaches (&amp;quot;riven&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;riviere&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;river2&amp;quot; -4 &amp;quot;fleuve&amp;quot;); and at the semantic
level within interlingua based approaches (&amp;quot;riviere&amp;quot;
-4 RIVER - DESTINATION: RIVER; &amp;quot;fleuve&amp;quot; —&gt;
RIVER - DESTINATION: SEA; &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; RIVER
- DESTINATION: SEA, RIVER), whereas again
&amp;quot;river&amp;quot; in English is not ambiguous with respect to
its destination.
In this paper, I show that ambiguity can be min-
imised if one stops considering knowledge sources as
&amp;quot;static&amp;quot; ones in order to consider them as active
ones instead. More specifically, I show that building
on a computational theory of lexico-semantic vague-
ness and underspecification which merges computa-
tional concerns with theoretical concerns enables an
NLP system to cope with polysemy and language
gaps in a more effective way.
Let us consider the following simplified input se-
mantics (IS):

to further specify Location for English as LocCon-

comes necessary to further distinguish Location, in
order to generate English from (2). In the next sec-
tions, I will show that lexical semantic hierarchies
are better suited to account for polysemous lexemes
than lexical or semantic hierarchies alone, for multi-
lingual (and monolingual) processing.

2 The WYSINNWYG Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967333333333">
I argue that treating lexical ambiguity or polysemy
and language gaps computationally requires 1) fine-
grained lexical semantic type hierarchies, and 2) to
allow words to have their meanings vary in context.
Much effort has been put into lexicons over the
years, and most systems give more room to lexical
data. However, most approaches to lexicon represen-
tation in NLP systems have been motivated more by
computational concerns (economy, efficiency) than
by the desire for a computational linguistic account,
where the concern of explaining a phenomenon is as
important as pure computational concerns. In this
paper, I adopt a computational linguistic perspec-
tive, showing however, how these representations are
best fitted to serve knowledge-driven NLP systems.

In this paper, I only address lexical representa-

the use of planning techniques, the integration of the

I illustrate through some examples below, how a
compositional semantics approach, e.g. knowledge-
based, can help in dealing with language gaps.&apos; I
will use the French (se tenir) and English (stand,
lie) simplified entries below, in my illustration of
mismatches between the generator and the lexicons.
Semantic types are coded in the sense feature:
&apos;Generation issues are fully discussed in (Beale and Vie-
gas, 1996). This first implementation of some language gaps
has a very limited capability for the treatment of vagueness
and underspecification; although it takes advantage of the se-
mantic type hierarchy, it still lacks the benefit of having the
lexical type hierarchy presented here.
2Note that absence of compositionality, such as in idioms
kick the (proverbial) bucket or syntagmatic expressions heavy
smoker, is coded in the lexicon.

to the lexicon entry for French. In Figure 2, one
can see in STH that PsVertical is a sub-type of Po-

to se-tenir3. This illustrates a case of vagueness be-
tween English and French. In this case, the gener-
ator will generate the same sentence John se tenait
contre le mur, as is the case for the exact match in
(i). Note that generating the divergence se tenait
debout (stand upright) although correct and gram-
matical, would emphasise the position of John which
was not necessarily focused in (4). The divergence
can be generated by &amp;quot;composing&amp;quot; PsVertical as Po-

2.2 A Truly Multilingual Hierarchy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999655">
Multilingual lexicons are usually monolingual lex-
icons connected via translation links (Tlinks),
whereas truly multilingual lexicons, as defined by
(Cahill and Gazdar, 1995), involve n + I hierar-
chies, thus involving an additional abstract hierarchy
containing information shared by two or more lan-
guages. Figure 3 illustrates the STH which is shared
by all lexicons (French, English, Spanish, etc), and
the lexical MLTH which involves the abstract hier-
archy shared by all LTHs.

needs extra work from the lexicon processor, with
respect to the entries presented here, as one does
not want to end up generating John se tint contre le
mur puis il se tint contre le mur (John was against
the wall then he was against the wall). Because of
the conjunctions here, one cannot just consider se
tenir as vague with respect to lie and stand. This
illustrates a lexicon in action, where the lexical pro-
cessor must process se tenir as underspecified:
PositionState -4 PsVertical V PsHorizontal
The lexical processor will thus produce the diver-
gences se tenir debout (stand) and se tenir allonge
(lying) to generate (with some generation process-
ing such as lexical choice, ellipsis, pronominalisa-
tion, etc) John se tenait (debout) contre le mur puis
s&apos;allongea contre mi (John was standing against the
wall then he lied against it).
Where the continuum perspective comes in, is that
we do not want to &amp;quot;freeze&amp;quot; the meanings of words
once and for all. As we just saw, in French one
might want to generate se tenir debout or just se
tenir depending on the semantics of its arguments
and also depending on the context as in (5).
In the WYSINNWYG approach, words are al-
lowed to have their &amp;quot;meanings&amp;quot; vary in context. In
other words, the literal meaning(s) coded in the lex-
icon is/are the &amp;quot;closest&amp;quot; possible meaning(s) of a
word within the STH context, and by enriching the
discourse context (dc), one ends up &amp;quot;specialising&amp;quot;

The lexicons themselves are also organised as lan-
guage lexical type hierarchies (Spanish LTH, English
LTH in Figure 3). For instance, the English dictio-
nary (eng-lexeme) has the English prepositions (eng-
prep) as one of its sub-types, which itself has as sub-
types all the English prepositions (along, through,
on, in, ...). These prepositions have in turn sub-
types (for instance, on has onl, on2, ...), which can
themselves have subtypes (onll, on12, ...). All these

erarchy (MLTH), which contains information shared
by all lexicons. There might be several levels of shar-
ing, for instance, family-related languages sharing.
Lexical types are linked to the STH via their lan-
guage LTH and the MLTH, so that these lexicons
can be used by either monolingual or multilingual
processing. The advantages of a MTLH extend to
1) lexicon acquisition, by allowing lexicons to inherit
information from the abstract level hierarchy. This
is even more useful when acquiring family-related
languages; and 2) robustness, as the lexical proces-
sors can try to &amp;quot;make guesses&amp;quot; on the assignment of
a sense to a lexeme absent from a dictionary, based
on similarities in morphology or orthography, with
other family-related language lexemes.3

The STH along with the LTH allow the lexicogra-
phers to leave the meaning of some lexemes as vague
or underspecified. The vagueness or underspecifica-
tion typing allows the lexical processor to specialise
or generalise the meaning of a lexeme, for a particu-
lar task and on a needed basis. Formally, generalisa-
tion and specialisation can be done in various ways,
as specified for instance in (Kameyama et al., 1991),
(Poesio, 1996), (Mahesh et al., 1997).

2.3.1 Lexicon Vagueness
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9977888">
A lexicon entry is considered as vague when its se-
mantics is typed using a general monomorphic type
covering multiple senses, as is the case of the French
entry &amp;quot;se-tenir3&amp;quot; , or the Spanish preposition en, as
represented in (6).

It is at processing time, and only if needed, that
the semantic type Location for en can be further pro-
cessed as LocContact, LocContainer, ... to generate
the English prepositions (on, at, ...).
Lexicon vagueness is represented by mapping the
citation form lex of any word x appearing in a corpus
to a semantic monomorphic type m, which belongs
to STH. Let us consider MAPS, the function which

2.3.2 Lexicon Underspecification
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988751375">
The meaning of a lexeme is considered as underspeci-
fied when its semantics is represented via a polymor-
phic type, which presents a disjunction of semantic
types,4 thus covering different polysemous senses,
as is the case of the Spanish preposition &amp;quot;por&amp;quot; in
(8), and typical examples in lexical semantics, such
as door which is typed as PHYSICAL_OBJECT-OR-

It is at processing time only, and on a needed ba-
sis only, that the semantic type Through-OR-Along
for por can be further processed as either Through,
or Along, ..., thus allowing the generator or analyser
to find the appropriate representation depending on
the task. Disambiguating &amp;quot;por&amp;quot; to generate English,
requires that the lexeme be embedded within the
discourse context, where the filled arguments of the
prepositions will provide semantic information un-
der constraints. For instance, walk and river could
contribute to the disambiguation of por as Along.
Lexicon underspecification is represented by map-
ping lex (the citation form of a word x) to a semantic
polymorphic type p, which belongs to STH, then:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.949182666666667">

3s C STH : p = Vs A Card(s) &gt; 2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.721875777777778">
In other words, lex is underspecified, if p is a dis-
junction of types, and no type/sub-type relation is
required.
4See (Sanfillippo, 1998) and (Buitelaar, 1997) for different
computational treatments of underspecified representations.
The former deals with multiple subcategorisations (whereas I
am also interested in polysemous senses), the latter includes
homonyms, which I agree with Pinkal (1995) should be left
apart.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.925868909090909">
51 believe that lexico-semantic underspecification is con-
cerned with polysemous lexemes only (such as door, book,
etc) and not homonyms (such as bank as financial-bank or
river-bank) called H-Type ambiguous in (Pinkal, 1995). I be-
lieve the H-Type ambiguous lexemes should be related via
their lexical form only, while their semantic types should re-
main unrelated, i.e., there is no needs to introduce a &amp;quot;disjunc-
tion fallacy&amp;quot; as in (Poesio, 1996). It might be the case that
homonyms require pragmatic underspecification as suggested,
for instance, in (Nunberg, 1979), but in any case are beyond
the scope of this paper.

2.4 Lexical Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978181818182">
Lexical rules (LRs) are used in WYSINNWYG to
relate systematic ambiguity to systematic polysemy.
They seem more appropriate than underspecification
for relating the meanings of lexemes such as &amp;quot;lamb&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;haddock&amp;quot; which can be either of type Animal or
Food (Pustejovsky, 1995, pp. 224). LRs and their
application time in NLP have received a lot of at-
tention (e.g., Copestake and Briscoe, 1996; Viegas et
al., 1996), therefore, I will not develop them further
in this paper, as the rules themselves activated by
the lexical processor produce different entries, with
neither type/sub-type relations nor disjunction be-
tween the semantic types of the old and new en-
tries. In WYSINNWYG, lexicon entries related via
LRs are neither vague nor underspecified. For in-
stance, the &amp;quot;grinding rule&amp;quot; of Copestake and Briscoe
for linking the systematic Animal - Food polysemy
as in mutton / sheep or in French where we have a
conflation in mouton, allows us to link the entries
in English and sub-senses in French, without hav-
ing to cope with the semantic &amp;quot;disjunction fallacy
problem&amp;quot; of (Poesio, 1996).

3 Conclusions - Perspectives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991234313953489">
I have argued for active knowledge sources
within a knowledge-based approach, so that lexicon
entries can be processed to best fit a particular NLP
task. I adopted a computational linguistic perspec-
tive in order to explain language phenomena such
as language gaps and polysemy. I argued for se-
mantic and lexical type hierarchies. The former is
shared by all dictionaries, whereas the latter can be
organised as a truly multilingual hierarchy. In that
respect, this work differs from (Han et al., 1996)
in that I do not suggest an ontology per language,
but argue on the contrary for one semantic hierar-
chy shared by all dictionaries.&apos; Other works which
have dealt with mismatches, e.g., (Dorr and Voss,
1998) with their interlingua and knowledge repre-
sentations, (Serasset, 1994) with his &amp;quot;interlingua ac-
ceptations&amp;quot; , or (Kameyama, et al, 1991) with their
infons, cannot account for cases which lie in between
clear-cut cases of divergences and mismatches such
as the example &amp;quot;se tenir&amp;quot; discussed in this paper.
I have shown that enabling lexicon entries to be
typed as either lexically vague or underspecified, or
linked via LRs, allows us to account for the varia-
tions of word meanings in different discourse con-
texts. Most of the works in computational lexical
semantics have dealt with either underspecification
or LRs, trying to favour one representation over the
other. There was previously no computational treat-
6However, I do not preclude that there might be different
views on the semantic hierarchy depending on the languages
considered: &amp;quot;filters&amp;quot; could be applied to the STH to only show
the relevant parts of it for some family-related languages.
ment of lexical semantic vagueness. In discourse ap-
proaches and formal semantics, the use of under-
specification in terms of truth values led researchers,
when applying their research to individual words,
to the &amp;quot;disjunction fallacy problem&amp;quot;, where a per-
son who went to the bank, ended up going to the
(financial-institution OR river-shore), whatever this
object might be!, instead of a) going to the financial-
institution OR b) going to the river-shore.
In this paper, I have presented the usefulness of
each representation, depending on the phenomenon
covered. I showed the need to consider underspecifi-
cation for polysemous items only, leaving homonyms
to be related via their lexical forms only (and not
their semantics). I believe that LRs have room for
polysemous lexemes such as the lamb example, as
here again one could not possibly imagine an ani-
mal being (food-OR-animal) in the same discourse
context.7
Finally, lexical vagueness enables a system to pro-
cess lexical items from a multilingual viewpoint,
when a lexeme becomes ambiguous with respect to
another language. From a multingual perspective,
there is no need to address the &amp;quot;sororites paradox&amp;quot;
(Williamson, 1994), which tries to put a clear-cut be-
tween values of the same word (e.g., not tall ... tall).
It is important to note that WYSINNWYG accepts
redundancy in the lexicon representations: lexemes
can be both vague and underspecified or either one.
One could object that the WYSINNWYG ap-
proach is knowledge intensive and puts the burden
on the lexicon, as it requires one to build several
type hierarchies: a STH shared by all languages and
a LTH per language which inherits from the MLTH.
However, the advantages of the WYSINNWYG ap-
proach are many. First, by using the MLTH, ac-
quisition costs can be minimised, as a lot of in-
formation can be inherited by lexicons of family-
related languages. This multilingual approach has
been successfully applied to phonology by (Cahill
and Gazdar, 1995). Second, the task of determining
the meaning of words requires human intervention,
and thus involves some subjectivity. WYSINNWYG
presents a good way of &amp;quot;reconciling&amp;quot; different lexi-
cographers&apos; viewpoints by allowing a lexical proces-
sor to specialise or generalise meanings on needed
basis. As such, whether a lexicographer decides to
sense-tag &amp;quot;en&amp;quot; as Location or creates the sub-senses
&amp;quot;en1&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;en2&amp;quot; remains a virtual difference for the
NLP system. Finally, and most important, WYSIN-
NWYG presents a typing environment which ac-
counts for the flexibility of word meanings in con-
text, thus allowing lexicon acquirers to map words
to their &amp;quot;closest&amp;quot; core meaning within STH (e.g., &amp;quot;se

as generalisation, specialisation) to modulate their
meanings in context (e.g., &amp;quot;se tenir&amp;quot; PsVertical).
In other words, WYSINNWYG helps not only in
sense selection but also in sense modulation.
Further research involves investigating representa-
tion formalisms, as discussed in (Briscoe et al., 1993)
to best implement these type inheritance hierarchies.

<abstract confidence="0.992229958132046">Much effort has been put into computational lexicons over the years, and most systems give much room to (lexical) semantic data. However, in these systems, the effort put on the study and representation of lexical items to express the underlying continuum existing in 1) language vagueness and polysemy, and 2) language gaps and mismatches, has remained embryonic. A sense enumeration approach fails from a theoretical point of view to capture the core meaning of words, let alone relate word meanings to one another, and complicates the task of NLP by multiplying ambiguities in analysis and choices in generation. In this paper, I study computational semantic lexicon representation from a multilingual point of view, reconciling different approaches to lexicon representation: i) vagueness for lexemes which have a more or less finer grained semantics with respect to other languages; ii) underspecification for lexemes which have multiple related facets; and, iii) lexical rules to relate systematic polysemy to systematic ambiguity. I build on a What You See Is Not Necessarily What You Get (WYSINNWYG) approach to provide the NLP system with the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; lexical data already tuned towards a particular task. In order to do so, I argue for a lexical semantic approach to lexicon representation. I exemplify my study through a cross-linguistic investigation on spatially-based expressions. 1 A Cross-linguistic Investigation on Spatially-based Expressions In this paper, I argue for computational semanlexicons as knowledge sources order to provide Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems with the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; lexical semantic representation to accomplish a particular task. In other words, lexicon entries are &amp;quot;pre-digested&amp;quot;, via a lexical processor, to best fit an NLP task. This What You See (in your lexicon) Is Not Necessarily What You Get (as input to your program) (WYSIN- NWYG) approach requires the adoption of a symbolic paradigm. Formally, I use a combination three different approaches to lexicon representations: (1) lexico-semantic vagueness, for lexemes which have a more or less finer grained semantics respect to other languages (for instance Spanish is vague between the Contact and Container senses of the Location, whereas in English it is finer with the former and the latter); (2) lexico-semantic underspecification, for lexemes which have multiple related facets (such as for is underspecified with respect to its Aperture or PhysicalObject meanings); and, (3) lexical rules, to relate systematic polysemy to systematic ambiguity (such as the Food Or Animal for I illustrate the WYSINNWYG approach via a cross-linguistic investigation (English, French, Spanish) on spatially-based expressions, as lexicalised, instance, in the prepositions above, on, . across) in French, predicative up) in French, or in adjecspatially-based expressions in a multilingual environment is a difficult problem as these lexemes exhibit a high degree of polysemy (in particular for prepositions) and of language gaps (i.e., when there is not a one-to-one mapping between languages, whatever the linguistic level; lexical, semantic, syntactic, etc). Therefore, processing these expressions or words in a multilingual environment minimally involves having a solution for (a) syntactic divergences, across —&gt; nage French (cross ... ming); (b) semantic mismatches, river translates riviere French; and (c), cases which lie between clear-cut cases of language gaps -4 tenir debout/se tenir allonge/se have dealt with a) and/or b), whereas WYSINNWYG presents a uniform treatment of a), b) and c), by allowing words to have their meanings vary in context. In this paper, I restrict my cross-linguistic study the semantics words with a focus on spatially-based expressions, and consider literal or non-figurative meanings only. In the next sections, I address representational problems which be solved in order to best capture the phenom- 1321 ena of ambiguity, polysemy and language gaps from a lexical semantic viewpoint. I then present three different ways of capturing the phenomena: lexicosemantic vagueness, lexico-semantic underspecification and lexical rules. 1.1 The Language Gap Problem Upon a close examination of empirical data, it is often difficult to classify a translation pair as a syntactic divergence (e.g., Dorr, 1990; Levin and Niren- 1993), as in limped up the stairs —&gt; ii monta marches en boitant (he went up the stairs limping) or a semantic mismatch (e.g., Palmer Zhibiao, 1995; Kameyama et al., 1991), as in -4 se (French). Moreover, be translated as tenir couche/allonge and tenir debout up) respectively, thus presenting a case of divergence, or they could both translated into French as tenir, presenting a case of conflation, (Talmy, 1985). Depending on the semantics of the first argument, one might to generate the divergence, (e.g., tenir denot (e.g., tenir), considering tenir a mismatch as in (1): se tenait au milieu de la chambre. (Sartre) (Pablo stood in the middle of the bedroom.) In order to account for all these language variations, one cannot &amp;quot;freeze&amp;quot; the meanings of language pairs. In section 2.1, I show that by adopting a continuum perspective, that is using a knowledge-based approach where I make the distinction between lexical and semantic knowledge, cases in between divergences and semantic mismatches be accounted for in a uniform way. Practically, the proposed method can be applied to interlingua approaches and transfer approaches, when these latter encode a layer of semantic information. 1.2 The Lexicon Representation Problem Within the paradigm of knowledge-based approaches, there are still lexicon representation issues to be addressed in order to treat these language gaps. It has been well documented in the literature of this past decade that a sense enumeration approach fails from a theoretical point of view to capture the core meaning of words (e.g., (Ostler and Atkins, 1992), (Boguraev and Pustejovsky, 1990),...) and complicates from a practical viewpoint the task of NLP by multiplying ambiguities in analysis and choices in generation. Within Machine Translation (MT), this approach has led researchers to &amp;quot;add&amp;quot; ambiguity in a language which did not have it from a monolingual perspective. Ambiguity is added at the lexical level within transfer based approaches (&amp;quot;riven&amp;quot; &amp;quot;riviere&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;river2&amp;quot; -4 &amp;quot;fleuve&amp;quot;); and at the semantic level within interlingua based approaches (&amp;quot;riviere&amp;quot; RIVER - DESTINATION: &amp;quot;fleuve&amp;quot; —&gt; RIVER - DESTINATION: SEA; &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; RIVER - DESTINATION: SEA, RIVER), whereas again &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; in English is not ambiguous with respect to its destination. In this paper, I show that ambiguity can be minimised if one stops considering knowledge sources as ones in order to consider them as ones instead. More specifically, I show that building on a computational theory of lexico-semantic vagueness and underspecification which merges computational concerns with theoretical concerns enables an NLP system to cope with polysemy and language gaps in a more effective way. Let us consider the following simplified input semantics (IS): (2) PositionState(Theme:Plate,Location:Table), can be generated in Spanish as plato esta la mesa; Location is lexicalised as en in Figure 1. To generate (2) into English, requires the system to further specify Location for English as LocConin order to generate plate is table, to the Spanish of en, as shown in Figure 1. spatia Whin instrument ea pm? 1 • • •r 1 Loxican: • Noun a Figure 1: Subset of the Semantic Types for Prepositions From a monolingual perspective, there is no need to differentiate in Spanish between the 3 types of Location as LocContact, LocContainer and LocBuildas these distinctions are irrelevant for Span- French: aCRR:311: location destination A LocContaineralong I on! l nor! nur1 dan§3 IvoI alone&apos; through eel-avers-de I throw+ I poe3 n6 1322 ish analysis or generation, with respect to Figure 1. However, within a multilingual framework, it becomes necessary to further distinguish Location, in order to generate English from (2). In the next sections, I will show that lexical semantic hierarchies are better suited to account for polysemous lexemes than lexical or semantic hierarchies alone, for multilingual (and monolingual) processing. 2 The WYSINNWYG Approach I argue that treating lexical ambiguity or polysemy and language gaps computationally requires 1) finegrained lexical semantic type hierarchies, and 2) to allow words to have their meanings vary in context. Much effort has been put into lexicons over the years, and most systems give more room to lexical data. However, most approaches to lexicon representation in NLP systems have been motivated more by computational concerns (economy, efficiency) than by the desire for a computational linguistic account, where the concern of explaining a phenomenon is as important as pure computational concerns. In this paper, I adopt a computational linguistic perspective, showing however, how these representations are best fitted to serve knowledge-driven NLP systems. 2.1 A Continuum Perspective on Language Gaps I argue that resolving language gaps (divergences, mismatches, and cases in between) is a generation issue and minimally involves: 1) using a knowledge-based approach to represent the lexical semantics of lexemes; 2) developing a computational theory of lexicosemantic vagueness, underspecification, and lexical rules; In this paper, I only address lexical representational issues, leaving the generation issues (such as the use of planning techniques, the integration of the process in lexical choice) aside.&apos; I illustrate through some examples below, how a compositional semantics approach, e.g. knowledgebased, can help in dealing with language gaps.&apos; I use the French tenir) English entries below, in my illustration of mismatches between the generator and the lexicons. Semantic types are coded in the sense feature: &apos;Generation issues are fully discussed in (Beale and Viegas, 1996). This first implementation of some language gaps has a very limited capability for the treatment of vagueness and underspecification; although it takes advantage of the semantic type hierarchy, it still lacks the benefit of having the lexical type hierarchy presented here. that absence of compositionality, such as in idioms the (proverbial) bucket syntagmatic expressions coded in the lexicon.

Figure 2: Example of an STH linked to a Fragment of the French and English LTHs. I illustrate below three main types of gaps between the input semantics (IS) to the generator and the lexicon entries (LEX) of the language in which to generate. I focus on the generation of the predicate: IS exact match in French, from the simplified IS below (3), is easy as there is a single French word in (3) that lexthe concept PositionState, which is tenir. tenir generated in se tenait conle (John was/(stood) against the wall).

The divergence can be generated by &amp;quot;composing&amp;quot; PsVertical as Po- (lexicalised se tenir) Vertical (lexas or &amp;quot;generalising&amp;quot; the meaning(s) of the word, using formally two hierarchies: semantic (STH) and lexidifferent types of lexicon representations: vagueness, underspecification and lexical rules. 2.2 A Truly Multilingual Hierarchy Multilingual lexicons are usually monolingual lexicons connected via translation links (Tlinks), whereas truly multilingual lexicons, as defined by and Gazdar, 1995), involve n + hierarchies, thus involving an additional abstract hierarchy containing information shared by two or more lan- Figure 3 illustrates the is shared by all lexicons (French, English, Spanish, etc), and lexical involves the abstract hierarchy shared by all LTHs.

Because of conjunctions here, one cannot just consider vague with respect to illustrates a lexicon in action, where the lexical promust process tenir underspecified: PsVertical V PsHorizontal The lexical processor will thus produce the divertenir debout and tenir allonge (lying) to generate (with some generation processing such as lexical choice, ellipsis, pronominalisaetc) se tenait (debout) contre le mur puis contre mi was standing against the wall then he lied against it). Where the continuum perspective comes in, is that we do not want to &amp;quot;freeze&amp;quot; the meanings of words once and for all. As we just saw, in French one want to generate tenir debout just on the semantics of its arguments and also depending on the context as in (5). In the WYSINNWYG approach, words are allowed to have their &amp;quot;meanings&amp;quot; vary in context. In other words, the literal meaning(s) coded in the lexicon is/are the &amp;quot;closest&amp;quot; possible meaning(s) of a word within the STH context, and by enriching the discourse context (dc), one ends up &amp;quot;specialising&amp;quot; Figure 3: Subset of the Multilingual Hierarchy for Prepositions The lexicons themselves are also organised as lanlexical type hierarchies (Spanish Figure 3). For instance, the English dictionary (eng-lexeme) has the English prepositions (engprep) as one of its sub-types, which itself has as subtypes all the English prepositions (along, through, on, in, ...). These prepositions have in turn subtypes (for instance, on has onl, on2, ...), which can themselves have subtypes (onll, on12, ...). All these language dependent LTHs inherit part of their inforfrom a truly Multilingual Lexical Type Hi- Spatinikelatino Contact MLTH mil noun 1324 erarchy (MLTH), which contains information shared by all lexicons. There might be several levels of sharing, for instance, family-related languages sharing. Lexical types are linked to the STH via their language LTH and the MLTH, so that these lexicons can be used by either monolingual or multilingual processing. The advantages of a MTLH extend to 1) lexicon acquisition, by allowing lexicons to inherit information from the abstract level hierarchy. This is even more useful when acquiring family-related languages; and 2) robustness, as the lexical processors can try to &amp;quot;make guesses&amp;quot; on the assignment of a sense to a lexeme absent from a dictionary, based on similarities in morphology or orthography, with family-related language 2.3 Vagueness, Underspecification and Lexical Rules along with the LTH allow the lexicographers to leave the meaning of some lexemes as vague or underspecified. The vagueness or underspecification typing allows the lexical processor to specialise or generalise the meaning of a lexeme, for a particular task and on a needed basis. Formally, generalisation and specialisation can be done in various ways, as specified for instance in (Kameyama et al., 1991), (Poesio, 1996), (Mahesh et al., 1997). 2.3.1 Lexicon Vagueness A lexicon entry is considered as vague when its semantics is typed using a general monomorphic type covering multiple senses, as is the case of the French entry &amp;quot;se-tenir3&amp;quot; , or the Spanish preposition en, as represented in (6).

Disambiguating &amp;quot;por&amp;quot; to generate English, requires that the lexeme be embedded within the discourse context, where the filled arguments of the prepositions will provide semantic information unconstraints. For instance, contribute to the disambiguation of por as Along. Lexicon underspecification is represented by mapcitation form of a word a semantic type belongs to STH, then: x is : in = mAPs(dc,lex(x))A : p = A &gt; other words, underspecified, if a disjunction of types, and no type/sub-type relation is required. (Sanfillippo, 1998) and (Buitelaar, 1997) for different computational treatments of underspecified representations. The former deals with multiple subcategorisations (whereas I am also interested in polysemous senses), the latter includes homonyms, which I agree with Pinkal (1995) should be left apart. believe that lexico-semantic underspecification is conwith polysemous lexemes only (such as book, not homonyms (such as financial-bank or river-bank) called H-Type ambiguous in (Pinkal, 1995). I believe the H-Type ambiguous lexemes should be related via their lexical form only, while their semantic types should remain unrelated, i.e., there is no needs to introduce a &amp;quot;disjunction fallacy&amp;quot; as in (Poesio, 1996). It might be the case that homonyms require pragmatic underspecification as suggested, for instance, in (Nunberg, 1979), but in any case are beyond the scope of this paper. 1325 2.4 Lexical Rules Lexical rules (LRs) are used in WYSINNWYG to relate systematic ambiguity to systematic polysemy. They seem more appropriate than underspecification for relating the meanings of lexemes such as &amp;quot;lamb&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;haddock&amp;quot; which can be either of type Animal or Food (Pustejovsky, 1995, pp. 224). LRs and their application time in NLP have received a lot of attention (e.g., Copestake and Briscoe, 1996; Viegas et al., 1996), therefore, I will not develop them further in this paper, as the rules themselves activated by the lexical processor produce different entries, with neither type/sub-type relations nor disjunction between the semantic types of the old and new entries. In WYSINNWYG, lexicon entries related via LRs are neither vague nor underspecified. For instance, the &amp;quot;grinding rule&amp;quot; of Copestake and Briscoe for linking the systematic Animal - Food polysemy in / sheep in French where we have a in us to link the entries in English and sub-senses in French, without having to cope with the semantic &amp;quot;disjunction fallacy problem&amp;quot; of (Poesio, 1996). Conclusions have argued for knowledge sources within a knowledge-based approach, so that lexicon entries can be processed to best fit a particular NLP task. I adopted a computational linguistic perspective in order to explain language phenomena such as language gaps and polysemy. I argued for semantic and lexical type hierarchies. The former is shared by all dictionaries, whereas the latter can be organised as a truly multilingual hierarchy. In that respect, this work differs from (Han et al., 1996) in that I do not suggest an ontology per language, but argue on the contrary for one semantic hierarchy shared by all dictionaries.&apos; Other works which have dealt with mismatches, e.g., (Dorr and Voss, 1998) with their interlingua and knowledge representations, (Serasset, 1994) with his &amp;quot;interlingua acceptations&amp;quot; , or (Kameyama, et al, 1991) with their infons, cannot account for cases which lie in between clear-cut cases of divergences and mismatches such as the example &amp;quot;se tenir&amp;quot; discussed in this paper. I have shown that enabling lexicon entries to be typed as either lexically vague or underspecified, or linked via LRs, allows us to account for the variations of word meanings in different discourse contexts. Most of the works in computational lexical semantics have dealt with either underspecification or LRs, trying to favour one representation over the There was previously no computational treat- I do not preclude that there might be different views on the semantic hierarchy depending on the languages considered: &amp;quot;filters&amp;quot; could be applied to the STH to only show the relevant parts of it for some family-related languages. ment of lexical semantic vagueness. In discourse approaches and formal semantics, the use of underspecification in terms of truth values led researchers, when applying their research to individual words, to the &amp;quot;disjunction fallacy problem&amp;quot;, where a person who went to the bank, ended up going to the (financial-institution OR river-shore), whatever this object might be!, instead of a) going to the financialinstitution OR b) going to the river-shore. In this paper, I have presented the usefulness of each representation, depending on the phenomenon covered. I showed the need to consider underspecification for polysemous items only, leaving homonyms to be related via their lexical forms only (and not their semantics). I believe that LRs have room for lexemes such as the as here again one could not possibly imagine an animal being (food-OR-animal) in the same discourse Finally, lexical vagueness enables a system to process lexical items from a multilingual viewpoint, when a lexeme becomes ambiguous with respect to another language. From a multingual perspective, there is no need to address the &amp;quot;sororites paradox&amp;quot; (Williamson, 1994), which tries to put a clear-cut bevalues of the same word (e.g., tall ... tall). important to note that WYSINNWYG accepts redundancy in the lexicon representations: lexemes can be both vague and underspecified or either one. One could object that the WYSINNWYG approach is knowledge intensive and puts the burden on the lexicon, as it requires one to build several type hierarchies: a STH shared by all languages and a LTH per language which inherits from the MLTH. However, the advantages of the WYSINNWYG approach are many. First, by using the MLTH, acquisition costs can be minimised, as a lot of information can be inherited by lexicons of familyrelated languages. This multilingual approach has been successfully applied to phonology by (Cahill and Gazdar, 1995). Second, the task of determining the meaning of words requires human intervention, and thus involves some subjectivity. WYSINNWYG presents a good way of &amp;quot;reconciling&amp;quot; different lexicographers&apos; viewpoints by allowing a lexical processor to specialise or generalise meanings on needed basis. As such, whether a lexicographer decides to sense-tag &amp;quot;en&amp;quot; as Location or creates the sub-senses &amp;quot;en1&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;en2&amp;quot; remains a virtual difference for the NLP system. Finally, and most important, WYSIN- NWYG presents a typing environment which accounts for the flexibility of word meanings in context, thus allowing lexicon acquirers to map words to their &amp;quot;closest&amp;quot; core meaning within STH (e.g., &amp;quot;se fact that some cultures eat &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; creatures would require to type these lexemes using underspecification (food- OR-animal) instead of a lexical rule in their cultures. 1326 tenir&amp;quot; PositionState) and use mechanisms (such as generalisation, specialisation) to modulate their meanings in context (e.g., &amp;quot;se tenir&amp;quot; PsVertical). In other words, WYSINNWYG helps not only in sense selection but also in sense modulation. Further research involves investigating representation formalisms, as discussed in (Briscoe et al., 1993) to best implement these type inheritance hierarchies. 4 Acknowledgements This work has been supported in part by DoD under contract number MDA-904-92-C-5189.

Practically, the proposed method can be applied to interlingua approaches and transfer approaches, when these latter encode a layer of semantic information. 1.2 The Lexicon Representation Problem Within the paradigm of knowledge-based approaches, there are still lexicon representation issues to be addressed in order to treat these language gaps. It has been well documented in the literature of this past decade that a sense enumeration approach fails from a theoretical point of view to capture the core meaning of words (e.g., (Ostler and Atkins, 1992), (Boguraev and Pustejovsky, 1990),...) and complicates from a practical viewpoint the task of NLP by multiplying ambiguities in analysis and choices in generation. Within Machine Translation (MT), this approach has led researchers to &amp;quot;add&amp;quot; ambiguity in a language which did not have it from a monolingual perspective. Ambiguity is added at the lexical level within transfer based approaches (&amp;quot;riven&amp;quot; &amp;quot;riviere&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;river2&amp;quot; -4 &amp;quot;fleuve&amp;quot;); and at the semantic level within interlingua based approaches (&amp;quot;riviere&amp;quot; -4 RIVER - DESTINATION: RIVER; &amp;quot;fleuve&amp;quot; —&gt; RIVER - DESTINATION: SEA; &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; RIVER - DESTINATION: SEA, RIVER), whereas again &amp;quot;</context>

I adopted a computational linguistic perspective in order to explain language phenomena such as language gaps and polysemy. I argued for semantic and lexical type hierarchies. The former is shared by all dictionaries, whereas the latter can be organised as a truly multilingual hierarchy. In that respect, this work differs from (Han et al., 1996) in that I do not suggest an ontology per language, but argue on the contrary for one semantic hierarchy shared by all dictionaries.&apos; Other works which have dealt with mismatches, e.g., (Dorr and Voss, 1998) with their interlingua and knowledge representations, (Serasset, 1994) with his &amp;quot;interlingua acceptations&amp;quot; , or (Kameyama, et al, 1991) with their infons, cannot account for cases which lie in between clear-cut cases of divergences and mismatches such as the example &amp;quot;se tenir&amp;quot; discussed in this paper.

Practically, the proposed method can be applied to interlingua approaches and transfer approaches, when these latter encode a layer of semantic information. 1.2 The Lexicon Representation Problem Within the paradigm of knowledge-based approaches, there are still lexicon representation issues to be addressed in order to treat these language gaps. It has been well documented in the literature of this past decade that a sense enumeration approach fails from a theoretical point of view to capture the core meaning of words (e.g., (Ostler and Atkins, 1992), (Boguraev and Pustejovsky, 1990),...) and complicates from a practical viewpoint the task of NLP by multiplying ambiguities in analysis and choices in generation. Within Machine Translation (MT), this approach has led researchers to &amp;quot;add&amp;quot; ambiguity in a language which did not have it from a monolingual perspective. Ambiguity is added at the lexical level within transfer based approaches (&amp;quot;riven&amp;quot; &amp;quot;riviere&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;river2&amp;quot; -4 &amp;quot;fleuve&amp;quot;); and at the semantic level within interlingua based approaches (&amp;quot;riviere&amp;quot; -4 RIVER - DESTINATION: RIVER; &amp;quot;fleuve&amp;quot; —&gt; RIVER - DESTINATION: SEA; &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; RIVER - DESTINA</context>

I believe that LRs have room for polysemous lexemes such as the lamb example, as here again one could not possibly imagine an animal being (food-OR-animal) in the same discourse context.7 Finally, lexical vagueness enables a system to process lexical items from a multilingual viewpoint, when a lexeme becomes ambiguous with respect to another language. From a multingual perspective, there is no need to address the &amp;quot;sororites paradox&amp;quot; (Williamson, 1994), which tries to put a clear-cut between values of the same word (e.g., not tall ... tall). It is important to note that WYSINNWYG accepts redundancy in the lexicon representations: lexemes can be both vague and underspecified or either one. One could object that the WYSINNWYG approach is knowledge intensive and puts the burden on the lexicon, as it requires one to build several type hierarchies: a STH shared by all languages and a LTH per language which inherits from the MLTH. However, the advantages of the WYSINNWYG approach are many. First, by using the MLTH, acquisition costs can be minimi</context>
