This report explores the question of compatibility
between annotation projects including translating
annotation formalisms to each other or to
common forms. Compatibility issues are crucial
for systems that use the results of multiple
annotation projects. We hope that this report will
begin a concerted effort in the field to track the
compatibility of annotation schemes for part of
speech tagging, time annotation, treebanking,
role labeling and other phenomena.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855279411765">
Different corpus annotation projects are driven
by different goals, are applied to different types
of data (different genres, different languages,
etc.) and are created by people with different
intellectual backgrounds. As a result of these and
other factors, different annotation efforts make
different underlying theoretical assumptions.
Thus, no annotation project is really theory-
neutral, and in fact, none should be. It is the
theoretical concerns which make it possible to
write the specifications for an annotation project
and which cause the resulting annotation to be
consistent and thus usable for various natural
language processing (NLP) applications. Of
course the theories chosen for annotation projects
tend to be theories that are useful for NLP. They
place a high value on descriptive adequacy (they
cover the data), they are formalized sufficiently
for consistent annotation to be possible, and they
tend to share major theoretical assumptions with
other annotation efforts, e.g., the noun is the head
of the noun phrase, the verb is the head of the
sentence, etc. Thus the term theory-neutral is
often used to mean something like NLP-friendly.
Obviously, the annotation compatibility problem
that we address here is much simpler than it
would be if we had to consider theories which
place a low emphasis on NLP-friendly properties
(Minimalism. Optimality Theory, etc.).
As annotation projects are usually research
efforts, the inherent theoretical differences may
be viewed as part of a search for the truth and the
enforcement of adherence to a given (potentially
wrong) theory could hamper this search. In
addition, annotation of particular phenomena
may be simplified by making theoretical
assumptions conducive to describing those
phenomena. For example, relative pronouns
(e.g., that in the NP the book that she read) may
be viewed as pronouns in an anaphora annotation
project, but as intermediate links to arguments
for a study of predicate argument structure.
On the other hand, many applications would
benefit by merging the results of different
annotation projects. Thus, differences between
annotation projects may be viewed as obstacles.
For example, combining two or more corpora
annotated with the same information may
improve a system (i.e., &amp;quot;there&apos;s no data like more
data.&amp;quot;) To accomplish this, it may be necessary
to convert corpora annotated according to one set
of specifications into a different system or to
convert two annotation systems into a third
system. For example, to obtain lots of part of
speech data for English, it is advantageous to
convert POS tags from several tagsets (see
Section 2) into a common form. For more
temporal data than is available in Timex3 format,
one might have to convert Timex2 and Timex3
tags into a common form (See Section 5).
Compromises that do not involve conversion can
be flawed. For example, a machine learner may
determine that feature A in framework 1 predicts
feature A&apos; in framework 2. However, the system
may miss that features A and B in framework 1
actually both correspond to feature A&apos;, i.e., they
are subtypes. In our view, directly modeling the
parameters of compatibility would be preferable.

Some researchers have attempted to combine a
number of different resource annotations into a
single merged form. One motivation is that the
merged representation may be more than the sum
of its parts. It is likely that inconsistencies and
errors (often induced by task-specific biases) can
be identified and adjusted in the merging
process; inferences may be drawn from how the
component annotation systems interact; a
complex annotation in a single framework may
be easier for a system to process than several
annotations in different frameworks; and a
merged framework will help guide further
annotation research (Pustojevsky, et. al. 2005).
Another reason to merge is that a merged
resource in language A may be similar to an
existing resource in language B. Thus merging
resources may present opportunities for
constructing nearly parallel resources, which in
turn could prove useful for a multilingual
application. Merging PropBank (Kingsbury, and
Palmer 2002) and NomBank (Meyers, et. al.
2004) would yield a predicate argument structure
for nouns and verbs, carrying more similar
information to the Praque Dependency
TreeBank&apos;s TectoGrammatical structure
(Hajicova and Ceplova, 2000) than either
component.
This report and an expanded online version
http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/wiki/corpuswg/Annotation
Compatibility both describe how to find
correspondences between annotation
frameworks. This information can be used to
combine various annotation resources in
different ways, according to one’s research goals,
and, perhaps, could lead to some standards for
combining annotation. This report will outline
some of our initial findings in this effort with an
eye towards maintaining and updating the online
version in the future. We hope this is a step
towards making it easier for systems to use
multiple annotation resources.

On our website, we provide correspondences
among a number of different part of speech
tagsets in a version of the table from pp. 141--
142 of Manning and Schütze (1999), modified
to include the POS classes from CLAWS1 and
ICE. Table 1 is a sample taken from this table
for expository purposes (the full table is not
provided due to space limitations). Traditionally,
part of speech represents a fairly coarse-grained
division among types of words, usually
distinguishing among: nouns, verbs, adjectives,
adverbs, determiners and possibly a few other
classes. While part of speech classifications may
vary for particular words, especially closed class
items, we have observed a larger problem. Most
part of speech annotation projects incorporate
other distinctions into part of speech
classification. Furthermore, they incorporate
different types of distinctions. As a result,
conversion between one tagset and another is
rarely one to one. It can, in fact, be many to
many, e.g., BROWN does not distinguish the

infinitive form of a verb (VB in the Penn
Treebank, V.X.infin in ICE) from the present-
tense form (VBP in the Penn Treebank, V.X.pres
in ICE) that has the same spelling (e.g., see in
They see no reason to leave). In contrast, ICE
distinguishes among several different
subcategories of verb (cop, intr, cxtr, dimontr,
ditr, montr and TRANS) and the Penn Treebank
does not.1 In a hypothetical system which merges
all the different POS tagsets, it would be
advantageous to factor out different types of
features (similar to ICE), but include all the
distinctions made by all the tag sets. For
example, if a token give is tagged as VBP in the
Penn Treebank, VBP would be converted into
VERB.anysubc.pres. If another token give was
tagged VB in Brown, VB would be converted to
VERB.anysubc{infin,n3pres} (n3pres = not-3rd-
person and present tense). This allows systems to
acquire the maximum information from corpora,
tagged by different research groups.
CKIP Chinese-Treebank (CCTB) and Penn
Chinese Treebank (PCTB) are two important
resources for Treebank-derived Chinese NLP
tasks (CKIP, 1995; Xia et al., 2000; Xu et al.,
2002; Li et al., 2004). CCTB is developed in
traditional Chinese (BIG5-encoded) at the
Academia Sinica, Taiwan (Chen et al., 1999;
Chen et al., 2003). CCTB uses the Information-
based Case Grammar (ICG) framework to
express both syntactic and semantic descriptions.
The present version CCTB3 (Version 3) provides
61,087 Chinese sentences, 361,834 words and 6
files that are bracketed and post-edited by
humans based on a 5-million-word tagged Sinica
Corpus (CKIP, 1995). CKIP POS tagging is a
hierarchical system. The first POS layers include
eight main syntactic categories, i.e. N (noun), V
(verb), D (adverb), A (adjective), C
(conjunction), I (interjection), T (particles) and P
(preposition). In CCTB, there are 6 non-terminal
phrasal categories: S (a complete tree headed by
a predicate), VP (a phrase headed by a
predicate), NP (a phrase beaded by an N), GP (a
phrase headed by locational noun or adjunct), PP

3. Differences Between Frameworks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999746">
We assume that certain high level differences
between annotation schemata should be ignored
if at all possible, namely those that represent
differences of analyses that are notationally
equivalent. In this section, we will discuss those
sorts of differences with an eye towards
evaluating whether real differences do in fact
exist, so that way users of annotation can be
careful should these differences be of
significance to their particular application.
To clarify, we are talking about the sort of high
level differences which reflect differences in the
linguistic framework used for representing
annotation, e.g., many frameworks represent
long distance dependencies in equivalent, but
different ways. In this sense, the linguistic
framework of the Penn Treebank is a phrase
structure based framework that includes a
particular set of node labels (POS tags, phrasal
categories, etc.), function tags, indices, etc. 2.

Figure 1 is a candidate rule for converting a
phrase structure tree to a dependency tree or vice
versa. Given a phrase consisting of constituents
C(n-i) to C(n+j), the rule assumes that: there is
one unique constituent C(n) that is the head of
the phrase; and it is possible to identify this head
in the phrase structure grammar, either using a
reliable heuristic or due to annotation that marks
the head of the phrase. When converting the

phrase structure tree to the dependency tree, the
rule promotes the head to the root of the tree.
When converting a dependency tree to a phrase
structure tree, the rule demotes the root to a
constituent, possibly marking it as the head, and
names the phrase based on the head’s part of
speech, e.g., nouns are heads of NPs. This rule is
insufficient because: (1) Identifying the head of a
phrase by heuristics is not 100% reliable and
most phrase structure annotation does not include
a marking for the head; (2) Some phrase
structure distinctions do not translate well to
some Dependency Grammars, e.g., the VP
analysis and nestings of prenominal modifiers3;
and (3) The rule only works for phrases that fit
the head plus modifiers pattern and many phrases
do not fit this pattern (uncontroversially).
While most assume that verbs act like the head
of the sentence, a Subject + VP analysis of a
sentence complicates this slightly. Regarding S-
bars (relative clauses, that-S, subordinate-
conjunction + S, etc.), there is some variation
3 The Prague Depedency Treebank orders dependency
branches from the same head to represent the scope of the
dependencies. Applicative Universal Grammar (Shauyman
1977) incorporates phrases into dependency structure.
among theories whether the verb or the pre-S
element (that, subordinate conjunction, etc.) is
assigned the head label. Names, Dates, and
other &amp;quot;patterned&amp;quot; phrases don&apos;t seem to have a
unique head. Rather there are sets of constituents
which together act like the head. For example, in
Dr. Mary Smith, the string Mary Smith acts like
the head. Idioms are big can of worms. Their
headedness properties vary quite a bit.
Sometimes they act like normal headed phrases
and sometimes they don&apos;t. For example, the
phrase pull strings for John obeys all the rules of
English that would be expected of a verb phrase
that consists of a verb, an NP and a complement
PP. In contrast, the phrase let alone (Fillmore, et.
al. 1988) has a syntax unique to that phrase.
Semi-idiomatic constructions (including phrasal
verbs, complex prepositions, etc.) raise some of
the same questions as idioms. While making
headedness assumptions similar to other phrases
is relatively harmless, there is some variation.
For example, in the phrase Mary called Fred up
on the phone, there are two common views: (a)
called is the head of the VP (or S) and up is a
particle that depends on called; and (b) the VP
has a complex head called up. For most
purposes, the choice between these two analyses
is arbitrary. Coordinate structures also require
different treatment from head + modifier phrases
-- there are multiple head-like constituents.
A crucial factor is that the notion head is used to
represent different things. (cf. Corbett, et. al.
1993, Meyers 1995). However, there are two
dominant notions. The first we will call the
functor (following Categorial Grammar). The
functor is the glue that holds the phrase together
-- the word that selects for the other words,
determines word order, licenses the construction,
etc. For example, coordinate conjunctions are
functors because they link the constituents in
their phrase together. The second head like
notion we will call the thematic head, the word
or words that determine the external selectional
properties of the phrase and usually the phrasal
category as well. For example, in the noun
phrase the book and the rock, the conjunction
and is the functor, but the nouns and book and
rock are thematic heads. The phrase is a concrete
noun phrase due to book and rock. Thus the
following sentence is well-formed: I held the
book and the rock, but the following sentence is
ill-formed *I held the noise and the redness.
Furthermore, the phrase the book and the rock is
a noun phrase, not a conjunction phrase.

<bodyText confidence="0.999995730769231">
In summary, there are some differences between
phrase structure and dependency analyses which
may be lost in translation, e.g., dependency
analyses include head-marking by default and
phrase structure analyses do not. On the other
hand, phrase structure analyses include relations
between groupings of words which may not
always be preserved when translating to
dependencies. Moreover, both identifying heads
and combining words into phrases have their
own sets of problems which can come to the
forefront when translation between the two
modalities is attempted. To be descriptively
adequate, frameworks that mark heads do deal
with these issues. The problem is that they are
dealt with in different ways across dependency
frameworks and across those phrase structure
frameworks where heads are marked. For
example, conjunction may be handled as being a
distinct phenomenon (another dimension) that
can be filtered through to the real heads.
Alternatively, a head is selected on theoretical or
heuristic grounds (the head of the first the
conjunct, the conjunction, etc.) When working
with multiple frameworks, a user must adjust for
the assumptions of each framework.

3.2 Gap Filling Mechanisms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999659666666667">
It is well-known that there are several equivalent
ways to represent long distance and lexically
based dependencies, e.g., (Sag and Fodor, 1994).
Re-entrant graphs (graphs with shared structure),
empty category/antecedent pairs, representations
of discontinuous constituents, among other
mechanisms can all be used to represent that
there is some relation R between two (or more)
elements in a linguistic structure that is, in some
sense, noncanonical. The link by any of these
mechanisms can be used to show that the relation
R holds in spite of violations of a proximity
constraint (long distance dependencies), a special
construction such as control, or many other
conditions. Some examples follow:

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993941875">
It seems to us that the same types of cases are
difficult for all such approaches. In the
unproblematic cases, there is a gap (or
equivalent) with a unique filler found in the same
sentence. In the &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot; cases, this does not
hold. In some examples, the filler is hypothetical
and should be interpreted something like the
pronoun anyone (4 below) or the person being
addressed (5). In other examples, the identity
between filler and gap is not so straight-forward.
In examples like (6), filler and gap are type
identical, not token identical (they represent
different reading events). In examples like (7), a
gap can take split antecedents. Conventional
filler/gap mechanims of all types have to be
modified to handle these types of examples.

3.3 Coreference and Anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999855">
There is little agreement concerning coreference
annotation in the research community. Funding
for the creation of the existing anaphorically
annotated corpora (MUC6/7, ACE) has come
primarily from initiatives focused on specific
application tasks, resulting in task-oriented
annotation schemes. On the other hand, a few
(typically smaller) corpora have also been
created to be consistent with existing, highly
developed theoretical accounts of anaphora from
a linguistic perspective. Accordingly, many
schemes for annotating coreference or anaphora
have been proposed, differing significantly with
respect to: (1) the task definition, i.e., what type
of semantic relations are annotated; (2) the
flexibility that annotators have.
By far the best known and most used scheme is
that originally proposed for MUC 6 and later
adapted for ACE. This scheme was developed to
support information extraction and its primary
aim is to identify all mentions of the same
objects in the text (‘coreference’) so as to collect
all predications about them. A &lt;coref&gt; element
is used to identify mentions of objects (the
MARKABLES); each markable is given an
index; subsequent mentions of already
introduced objects are indicated by means of the
REF attribute, which specifies the index of the
previous mention of the same object. For
example, in (1), markable 10 is a mention of the
same object as markable 9. (This example is
adapted from a presentation by Jutta Jaeger.)

The purpose of the annotation is to support
information extraction. To increase coding
reliability, the MUC scheme conflates different
semantic relations into a single IDENT relation.
For example, coders marked pairs of NPs as
standing in IDENT relations, even when these
NPs would more normally be assumed to be in a
predication relations, e.g., appositions as in 2 and
NPs across a copula as in 3. This conflation of
semantic relations is a convenient simplification
in many cases but it is untenable in general, as
discussed by van Deemter &amp; Kibble (2001).

<bodyText confidence="0.99161365625">
From the point of view of markup technology,
the way used to represent coreference relations in
MUC is very restrictive. Only one type of link
can be annotated at a time: i.e., it is not possibly
to identify a markable as being both a mention of
a previously introduced referent and as a
bridging reference on a second referent. In
addition, the annotators do not have the option to
mark anaphoric expressions as ambiguous.
The MATE `meta-scheme’ (Poesio, 1999) was
proposed as a very general repertoire of markup
elements that could be used to implement a
variety of existing coreference schemes, such as
MUC or the MapTask scheme, but also more
linguistically motivated schemes. From the point
of view of markup technology, the two crucial
differences from the MUC markup method are
that the MATE meta-scheme is (i) based on
standoff technology, and, most relevant for what
follows, (ii) follows the recommendations of the
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) which suggest
separating relations (‘LINKs’) from markables.
LINKs can be used to annotate any form of
semantic relations (indeed, the same notion was
used in the TimeML annotation of temporal
relations). A structured link, an innovation of
MATE, can represent ambiguity (Poesio &amp;
Artstein, 2005). In (4), for example, the
antecedent of the pronoun realized by markable
ne03 in utterance 3.3 could be either engine E2
or the boxcar at Elmira; with the MATE scheme,
coders can mark their uncertainty.

The MATE meta-scheme also allowed a richer
set of semantic relations in addition to IDENT,
including PART-OF, PRED for predicates, etc.,
as well as methods for marking antecedents not
explicitly introduced via an NP, such as plans
and propositions. Of course, using this added
power is only sensible when accompanied by
experimentally tested coding schemes.
The MATE meta-scheme was the starting point
for the coding scheme used in the GNOME
project (Poesio 2004). In this project, a scheme
was developed to model anaphoric relations in
text in the linguistic sense—e.g., the information
about discourse entities and their semantic
relations expressed by the text. A relation called
IDENT was included, but it was only used to
mark the relation between mentions of the same
discourse entity; so, for example, neither of the
relations in (2) would be marked in this way.
From the point of view of coding schemes used
for resource creation, the MATE meta-scheme
gave rise to two developments: the standoff
representation used in the MMAX annotation
tool, and the Reference Annotation Framework
(Salmon-Alt &amp; Romary, 2004). MMAX was the
first usable annotation tool for standoff
annotation of coreference (there are now at least
three alternatives: Penn’s WordFreak, MITRE’s
CALISTO, and the NITE XML tools). The
markup scheme was a simplification of the
MATE scheme, in several respects. First of all,
cross-level reference is not done using href links,

<bodyText confidence="0.928356076923077">
but by specifying once and for all which files
contain the base level and which files contain
each level of representation; each level points to
the same base level. Secondly, markables and
coref links are contained in the same file.
5. [ markable file]

&lt;/markables&gt;
The original version of MMAX, 0.94, only
allowed to specify one identity link and one
bridging reference per markable, but beginning
version 2.0, multiple pointers are possible. An
interesting aspect of the proposal is that identity
links are represented by specifying membership
to coreference chains instead of linking to
previous mentions. Multiple pointers were used
in the ARRAU project to represent ambiguous
links, with some restrictions. The RAF
framework was proposed not to directly support
annotation, but as a rich enough markup
framework to be used for annotation exchange.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.829012">
3.3.2 Conversion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999633">
Several types of conversion between formats for
representing coreference information are
routinely performed. Perhaps the most common
problem is to convert between inline formats
used for different corpora: e.g., to convert the
MUC6 corpus into GNOME. However, it is
becoming more and more necessary to to convert
standoff into inline formats for processing (e.g.,
MMAX into MAS-XML), and viceversa.
The increasing adoption of XML as a standard
has made the technical aspect of conversion
relatively straightforward, provided that the same
information can be encoded. For example,
because the GNOME format is richer than both
the MUC and MMAX format, it should be
straightforward to convert a MUC link into a
GNOME link. However, the correctness of the
conversion can only be ensured if the same
coding instructions were followed; the MUC
IDENT links used in (2) and (3) would not be
expressed in the GNOME format as IDENT
links. There is no standard method we know of
for identifying these problematic links, although
syntactic information can sometimes help. The
opposite of course is not true; there is no direct
way of representing the information in (4) in the
MUC format. Conversion between the MAS-
XML and the MMAX format is also possible,
provided that pointers are used to represent both
bridging references and identity links.

4 Predicate-Argument Relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912738095238">
Predicate argument relations are labeled relations
between two words/phrases of a linguistic
description such that one is a semantic predicate
or functor and the other is an argument of this
predicate. In the sentence The eminent linguist
read the book, there is a SUBJECT (or AGENT,
READER, ARG0, DEPENDENT etc.) relation
between the functor read and the phrase The
eminent linguist or possibly the word linguist if
assuming a dependency framework. Typically,
the functor imposes selectional restrictions on the
argument. The functor may impose word order
restrictions as well, although this would only
effect &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; arguments (e.g., not arguments
related by WH extraction). Another popular way
of expressing this relation is to say that read
assigns the SUBJECT role to The eminent
linguist in that sentence. Unfortunately, this way
of stating the relation sometimes gives the false
impression that a particular phrase can only be a
member of one such relation. However, this is
clearly not the case, e.g., in The eminent linguist
who John admires read the book, The eminent
linguist is the argument of: (1) a SUBJECT
relation with read and an OBJECT relation with
admires. Predicate-argument roles label relations
between items and are not simply tags on phrases
(like Named Entity Tags, for example).
There are several reasons why predicate
argument relations are of interest for natural
language processing, but perhaps the most basic
reason is that they provide a way to factor out the
common meanings from equivalent or nearly
equivalent utterances. For example, most
systems would represent the relation between
Mary and eat in much the same way in the
sentences: Mary ate the sandwich, The sandwich
was eaten by Mary, and Mary wanted to eat the
sandwich. Crucially, the shared aspect of
meaning can be modeled as a relation with eat
(or ate) as the functor and Mary as the argument
(e.g., SUBJECT). Thus providing predicate
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998431">
45
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986287356322">
argument relations can provide a way to
generalize over data and, perhaps, allow systems
to mitigate against the sparse data problem.
Systems for representing predicate argument
relations vary drastically in granularity, In
particular, there is a long history of disagreement
about the appropriate level of granularity of role
labeling, the tags used to distinguish between
predicate argument relations. At one extreme, no
distinction is made between predicate relations,
one simply marks that the functor and argument
are in a predicate-argument relation (e.g.,
unlabeled dependency trees). In another
approach, one might distinguish among the
arguments of each predicate with a small set of
labels, sometimes numbered -- examples of this
approach include Relational Grammar
(Perlmutter 1984), PropBank and NomBank.
These labels have different meanings for each
functor, e.g., the subject of eat, write and devour
are distinct. This assumes a very high level of
granularity, i.e., there are several times the
number of possible relations as there are distinct
functors. So 1000 verbs may license as many as
5000 distinct relations. Under other approaches,
a small set of relation types are generalized
across functors. For example, under Relational
Grammar&apos;s Universal Alignment Hypothesis
(Perlmutter and Postal 1984, Rosen 1984),
subject, object and indirect object relations are
assumed to be of the same types regardless of
verb. These terms thus are fairly coarse-grained
distinctions between types of predicate/argument
relations between verbs and their arguments.
Some predicate-neutral relations are more fine
grained, including Panini&apos;s Karaka of 2000 years
ago, and many of the more recent systems which
make distinctions such as agent, patient, theme,
recipient, etc. (Gruber 1965, Fillmore 1968,
Jackendoff 1972). The (current) International
Annotation of Multilingual Text Corpora project
(http://aitc.aitc.net.org/nsf/iamtc/) takes this
approach. Critics claim that it can be difficult to
maintain consistency across predicates with these
systems without constantly increasing the
inventory of role labels to describe idiosyncratic
relations, e.g., the relation between the verbs
multiply, conjugate, and their objects. For
example, only a very idiosyncratic classification
could capture the fact that only a large round
object (like the Earth) can be the object of
circumnavigate. It can also be unclear which of
two role labels apply. For example, there can be
a thin line between a recipient and a goal, e.g.,
the prepositional object of John sent a letter to
the Hospital could take one role or the other
depending on a fairly subtle ambiguity.
To avoid these problems, some annotation
research (and some linguistic theories) has
abandoned predicate-neutral approaches, in favor
of the approaches that define predicate relations
on a predicate by predicate basis. Furthermore,
various balances have been attempted to solve
some of the problems of the predicate-neutral
relations. FrameNet defines roles on a scenario
by scenario basis, which limits the growth of the
inventory of relation labels and insures
consistency within semantic domains or frames.
On the other hand, the predicate-by-predicate
approach is arguably less informative then the
predicate-neutral approach, allowing for no
generalization of roles across predicates. Thus
although PropBank/NomBank use a strictly
predicate by predicate approach, there have been
some attempts to regularize the numbering for
semantically related predicates. Furthermore, the
descriptors used by the annotators to define roles
can sometimes be used to help make finer
distinctions (descriptors often include familiar
role labels like agent, patient, etc.)
The diversity of predicate argument labeling
systems and the large inventory of possible role
labels make it difficult to provide a simple
mapping (like Table 1 for part of speech
conversion) between these types of systems. The
SemLink project provides some insight into how
this mapping problem can be solved.

4.2.1 Background
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995125">
VerbNet consists of hierarchies of verb classes,
extended from those of Levin 1993. Each class
and subclass is characterized extensionally by its
set of verbs, and intensionally by argument lists
and syntactic/semantic features of verbs. The full
argument list consists of 23 thematic roles, and
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998536">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997965625">
possible selectional restrictions on the arguments
are expressed using binary predicates. VerbNet
has been extended from the Levin classes, and
now covers 4526 senses for 3175 lexemes. A
primary emphasis for VerbNet is grouping verbs
into classes with coherent syntactic and semantic
characterizations in order to facilitate acquisition
of new class members based on observable
syntactic/semantic behavior. The hierarchical
structure and small number of thematic roles is
intended to support generalizations.
FrameNet consists of collections of semantic
frames, lexical units that evoke these frames, and
annotation reports that demonstrate uses of
lexical units. Each semantic frame specifies a set
of frame elements. These are elements that
describe the situational props, participants and
components that conceptually make up part of
the frame. Lexical units appear in a variety of
parts of speech, though we focus on verbs here.
A lexical unit is a lexeme in a particular sense
defined in its containing semantic frame. They
are described in reports that list the syntactic
realizations of the frame elements, and valence
patterns that describe possible syntactic linking
patterns. 3486 verb lexical units have been
described in FrameNet which places a primary
emphasis on providing rich, idiosyncratic
descriptions of semantic properties of lexical
units in context, and making explicit subtle
differences in meaning. As such it could provide
an important foundation for reasoning about
context dependent semantic representations.
However, the large number of frame elements
and the current sparseness of annotations for
each one has hindered machine learning.
PropBank is an annotation of 1M words of the
Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank
II with semantic role labels for each verb
argument. Although the semantic roles labels are
purposely chosen to be quite generic, i.e., ArgO,
Arg1, etc., they are still intended to consistently
annotate the same semantic role across syntactic
variations, e.g., Arg1 in &amp;quot;John broke the
window&amp;quot; is the same window (syntactic object)
that is annotated as the Arg1 in &amp;quot;The window
broke&amp;quot; (syntactic subject). The primary goal of
PropBank is to provide consistent general
labeling of semantic roles for a large quantity of
text that can provide training data for supervised
machine learning algorithms. PropBank can also
provide frequency counts for (statistical) analysis
or generation. PropBank includes a lexicon
which lists, for each broad meaning of each
annotated verb, its &amp;quot;frameset&amp;quot;, the possible
arguments, their labels and all possible syntactic
realizations. This lexical resource is used as a set
of verb-specific guidelines by the annotators, and
can be seen as quite similar in nature to
FrameNet, although much more coarse-grained
and general purpose in the specifics.
To summarize, PropBank and FrameNet both
annotate the same verb arguments, but assign
different labels. PropBank has a small number of
vague, general purpose labels with sufficient
amounts of training data geared specifically to
support successful machine learning. FrameNet
provides a much richer and more explicit
semantics, but without sufficient amounts of
training data for the hundreds of individual frame
elements. An ideal environment would allow us
to train generic semantic role labelers on
PropBank, run them on new data, and then be
able to map the resulting PropBank argument
labels on rich FrameNet frame elements.
The goal of SemLink is to create just such an
environment. VerbNet provides a level of
representation that is still tied to syntax, in the
way that PropBank is, but provides a somewhat
more fine-grained set of role labels and a set of
fairly high level, general purpose semantic
predicates, such as contact(x,y), change-of-
location(x, path), cause(A, X), etc. As such it can
be seen as a mediator between PropBank and
FrameNet. In fact, our approach has been to use
the explicit syntactic frames of VerbNet to semi-
automatically map the PropBank instances onto
specific VerbNet classes and role labels. The
mapping can then be hand-corrected. In parallel,
SemLink has been creating a mapping table from
VerbNet class(es) to FrameNet frame(s), and
from role label to frame element. This will allow
the SemLink project to automatically generate
FrameNet representations for every VerbNet
version of a PropBank instance with an entry in
the VerbNet-FrameNet mapping table.

robustness. The fact that these two resources are
now mapped gives researchers different levels of
representation for events these verbs represent to
be used in natural language applications. The
mapping between VerbNet and FrameNet was
done in two steps: (1) mapping VerbNet verb
senses to FrameNet lexical units; (2) mapping
VerbNet thematic roles to the equivalent (if pre-
sent) FrameNet frame elements for the corre-
sponding class/frame mappings uncovered dur-
ing step 1.
In the first task, VerbNet verb senses were
mapped to corresponding FrameNet senses, if
available. Each verb member of a VerbNet class
was assigned to a (set of) lexical units of Frame-
Net frames according to semantic meaning and
to the roles this verb instance takes. These
mappings are not one-to-one since VerbNet and
FrameNet were built with distinctly different
design philosophies. VerbNet verb classes are
constructed by grouping verbs based mostly on
their participation in diathesis alternations. In
contrast, FrameNet is designed to group lexical
items based on frame semantics, and a single
FrameNet frame may contain sets of verbs with
related senses but different subcategorization
properties and sets of verbs with similar syntactic
behavior may appear in multiple frames.
The second task consisted of mapping VerbNet
thematic roles to FrameNet frame elements for
the pairs of classes/frames found in the first task.
As in the first task, the mapping is not always
one-to-one as FrameNet tends to record much
more fine-grained distinctions than VerbNet.
So far, 1892 VerbNet senses representing 209
classes were successfully mapped to FrameNet
frames. This resulted in 582 VerbNet class –
FrameNet frame mappings, across 263 unique
FrameNet frames, for a total of 2170 mappings
of VerbNet verbs to FrameNet lexical units.

SemLink is also creating a mapping between
VerbNet and PropBank, which will allow the use
of the machine learning techniques that have
been developed for PropBank annotations to
generate more semantically abstract VerbNet
representations. The mapping between VerbNet
and PropBank can be divided into two parts: a
&amp;quot;lexical mapping&amp;quot; and an &amp;quot;instance classifier.&amp;quot;
The lexical mapping defines the set of possible
mappings between the two lexicons, independent
of context. In particular, for each item in the
source lexicon, it specifies the possible
corresponding items in the target lexicon; and for
each of these mappings, specifies how the
detailed fields of the source lexicon item (such as
verb arguments) map to the detailed fields of the
target lexicon item. The lexical mapping
provides a set of possible mappings, but does not
specify which of those mappings should be used
for each instance; that is the job of the instance
classifier, which looks at a source lexicon item in
context, and chooses the most appropriate target
lexicon items allowed by the lexical mapping.
The lexical mapping was created semi-
automatically, based on an initial mapping which
put VerbNet thematic roles in correspondence
with individual PropBank framesets. This lexical
mapping consists of a mapping between the
PropBank framesets and VerbNet&apos;s verb classes;
and a mapping between the roleset argument
labels and the VerbNet thematic roles. During
this initial mapping, the process of assigning a
verb class to a frameset was performed manually
while creating new PropBank frames. The
thematic role assignment, on the other hand, was
a semi-automatic process which finds the best
match for the argument labels, based on their
descriptors, to the set of thematic role labels of
VerbNet. This process required human
intervention due to the variety of descriptors for
PropBank labels, the fact that the argument label
numbers are not consistent across verbs, and
gaps in frameset to verb class mappings.
To build the instance classifier, SemLink started
with two heuristic classifiers. The first classifier
works by running the SenseLearner WSD engine
to find the WordNet class of each verb; and then
using the existing WordNet/VerbNet mapping to
choose the corresponding VerbNet class. This
heuristic is limited by the performance of the
WSD engine, and by the fact that the
WordNet/VerbNet mapping is not available for
all VerbNet verbs. The second heuristic classifier
examines the syntactic context for each verb
instance, and compares it to the syntactic frames
of each VerbNet class. The VerbNet class with a
syntactic frame that most closely matches the
instance&apos;s context is assigned to the instance.
The SemLink group ran these two heuristic
methods on the Treebank corpus and are hand-

<bodyText confidence="0.999965916666667">
correcting the results in order to obtain a
VerbNet-annotated version of the Treebank
corpus. Since the Treebank corpus is also
annotated with PropBank information, this will
provide a parallel VerbNet/PropBank corpus,
which can be used to train a supervised classifier
to map from PropBank frames to VerbNet
classes (and vice versa). The feature space for
this machine learning classifier includes
information about the lexical and syntactic
context of the verb and its arguments, as well as
the output of the two heuristic methods.

Annotation compatibility is also an issue for
related formalisms. Two columns in Table 1 are
devoted to different CLAWS POS tagsets, but there
are several more CLAWS tagsets
(www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/ucrel/annotation.html),
differing both in degree of detail and choice of
distinctions made. Thus a detailed conversion
table among even just the CLAWS tagsets may
prove handy. Similar issues arise with the year to
year changes of the ACE annotation guidelines
(projects.ldc.upenn.edu/ace/ ) which include
named entity, semantic classes for nouns,
anaphora, relation and event annotation. As
annotation formalisms mature, specifications
can change to improve annotation consistency,
speed or the usefulness for some specific task. In
the interest of using old and new annotation
together (more training data), it is helpful to have
explicit mappings for related formalisms. Table 2
is a (preliminary) conversion table for Timex2
and Timex3, the latter of which can be viewed
essentially as an elaboration of the former.

6. The Effect of Language Differences
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953677419355">
Most researchers involved in linguistic
annotation (particularly for NLP) take it for
granted that coverage of a particular grammar for
a particular language is of the utmost important.
The (explanatory) adequacy of the particular
linguistic theory assumed for multiple languages
is considered a much less important. Given the
diversity of annotation paradigms, we may go a
step further and claim that it may be necessary to
change theories when going from one language
to another. In particular, language-specific
phenomena can complicate theories in ways that
prove unnecessary for languages lacking these
phenomena. For example, English requires a
much simpler morphological framework then
languages like German, Russian, Turkish or
Pashto. It has also been claimed on several
occasions that a VP analysis is needed in some
languages (English), but not others (Japanese).
For the purposes of annotation, it would seem
simplest to choose the simplest language-
specific framework that is capable of capturing
the distinctions that one is attempting to
annotate. If the annotation is robust, it should be
possible to convert it automatically into some
language-neutral formalism should one arise that
maximizes descriptive and explanatory
adequacy. In the meanwhile, it would seem
unnecessary to complicate grammars of specific
languages to account for phenomena which do
not occur in those languages.

6.1 The German TüBa-D/Z Treebank
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998804">
German has a freer word order than English.
This concerns the distribution of the finite verb
and the distribution of arguments and adjuncts.
German is a general Verb-Second language
which means that in the default structure in
declarative main clauses as well as in wh-
questions the finite verb surfaces in second
position preceded by only one constituent which
is not necessarily the subject. In embedded
clauses the finite verb normally occurs in a verb-
phrase-final position following its arguments and
adjuncts, and other non-finite verbal elements.
German is traditionally assumed to have a head-
final verb phrase. The ordering of arguments and
adjuncts is relatively free. Firstly almost any
constituent can be topicalised preceding the finite
verb in Verb-Second position. Secondly the
order of the remaining arguments and adjuncts is
still relatively free. Ross (1967) coined the term
Scrambling to describe the variety of linear
orderings. Various factors are discussed to play a
role here such as pronominal vs. phrasal
constituency, information structure, definiteness
and animacy (e.g. Uszkoreit 1986).
The annotation scheme of the German TüBa-D/Z
treebank was developed with special regard to
these properties of German clause structure. The
main ordering principle is adopted from
traditional descriptive analysis of German (e.g.
Herling 1821, Höhle 1986). It partitions the
clause into &apos;topological fields&apos; which are defined
by the distribution of the verbal elements. The
top level of the syntactic tree is a flat structure of
field categories including: Linke Klammer - left
bracket (LK) and Rechte Klammer - verbal
complex (VC) for verbal elements and Vorfeld -
initial field (VF), C-Feld - complementiser field
(C), Mittelfeld - middle field (MF), Nachfeld -
final field (NF) for other elements.
Below the level of field nodes the annotation
scheme provides hierarchical phrase structures
except for verb phrases. There are no verb
phrases annotated in TüBa-D/Z. It was one of the
major design decisions to capture the distribution
of verbal elements and their arguments and
adjuncts in terms of topological fields instead of
hierarchical verb phrase structures. The free
word order would have required to make
extensive use of traces or other mechanisms to
relate dislocated constituents to their base

positions, which in itself was problematic since
there is no consensus among German linguists on
what the base ordering is. An alternative which
avoids commitment to specific base positions is
to use crossing branches to deal with
discontinuous constituents. This approach is
adopted for example by the German TIGER
treebank (Brants et al. 2004). A drawback of
crossing branches is that the treebank cannot be
modeled by a context free grammar. Since TUBa-
D/Z was intended to be used for parser training,
it was not a desirable option. Arguments and
adjuncts are thus related to their predicates by
means of functional labels. In contrast to the
Penn Treebank, TUBa-D/Z assigns grammatical
functions to all arguments and adjuncts. Due to
the freer word order functions cannot be derived
from relative positions only.
The choice of labels of grammatical functions is
largely based on the insight that grammatical
functions in German are directly related to the
case assignment (Reis 1982). The labels
therefore do not refer to grammatical functions
such as subject, direct object or indirect object
but make a distinction between complement and
adjunct functions and classify the nominal
complements according to their case marking:
accusative object (OA), dative object (OD),
genitive object (OG), and also nominative
&apos;object&apos; (ON) versus verbal modifier (V-MOD) or
underspecified modifier (MOD).
Within phrases a head daughter is marked at each
projection level. Exceptions are elliptical
phrases, coordinate structures, strings of foreign
language, proper names and appositions within
noun phrases. Modifiers of arguments and
adjuncts are assigned a default non-head
function. In case of discontinuous constituents
the function of the modifier is either explicitly
marked by means of a complex label such as
OA-MOD (the modifier of an accusative object)
or by means of a secondary edge REFINT in
case the modified phrase has a default head or
non-head function itself (which holds in the case
of e.g. NP complements of prepositions).
Figures 2 to 4 illustrate the German TUBa-D/Z
treebank annotation scheme (Telljohann et al.
(2005). – it combines a flat topological analysis
with structural and functional information.

This report has laid out several major annotation
compatibility issues, focusing primarily on
conversion among different annotation
frameworks that represent the same type of
information. We have provided procedures for
conversion, along with their limitations. As more
work needs to be done in this area, we intend to
keep the online version available for cooperative
elaboration and extension. Our hope is that the
conversion tables will be extended and more
annotation projects will incorporate details of
their projects in order to facilitate compatibility.
The compatibility between annotation
frameworks becomes a concern when (for
example) a user attempts to use annotation
created under two or more distinct frameworks
for a single application. This is true regardless of
whether the annotation is of the same type (the
user wants more data for a particular
phenomenon); or of different types (the user
wants to combine different types of information).

The free word order would have required to make extensive use of traces or other mechanisms to relate dislocated constituents to their base 50 positions, which in itself was problematic since there is no consensus among German linguists on what the base ordering is. An alternative which avoids commitment to specific base positions is to use crossing branches to deal with discontinuous constituents. This approach is adopted for example by the German TIGER treebank (Brants et al. 2004). A drawback of crossing branches is that the treebank cannot be modeled by a context free grammar. Since TUBaD/Z was intended to be used for parser training, it was not a desirable option. Arguments and adjuncts are thus related to their predicates by means of functional labels.

The goal is to develop computationally explicit connections between these resources combining individual advantages and overcoming their limitations. 4.2.1 Background VerbNet consists of hierarchies of verb classes, extended from those of Levin 1993. Each class and subclass is characterized extensionally by its set of verbs, and intensionally by argument lists and syntactic/semantic features of verbs. The full argument list consists of 23 thematic roles, and 46 possible selectional restrictions on the arguments are expressed using binary predicates. VerbNet has been extended from the Levin classes, and now covers 4526 senses for 3175 lexemes. A primary emphasis for VerbNet is grouping verbs into classes with coherent syntactic and semantic characterizations in order to facilitate acquisition of new class members based on observable synta</context>

For example, in the phrase Mary called Fred up on the phone, there are two common views: (a) called is the head of the VP (or S) and up is a particle that depends on called; and (b) the VP has a complex head called up. For most purposes, the choice between these two analyses is arbitrary. Coordinate structures also require different treatment from head + modifier phrases -- there are multiple head-like constituents. A crucial factor is that the notion head is used to represent different things. (cf. Corbett, et. al. 1993, Meyers 1995). However, there are two dominant notions. The first we will call the functor (following Categorial Grammar). The functor is the glue that holds the phrase together -- the word that selects for the other words, determines word order, licenses the construction, etc. For example, coordinate conjunctions are functors because they link the constituents in their phrase together. The second head like notion we will call the thematic head, the word or words that determine the external selectional properties of the phrase and usually the phrasal category as well.

From the point of view of markup technology, the two crucial differences from the MUC markup method are that the MATE meta-scheme is (i) based on standoff technology, and, most relevant for what follows, (ii) follows the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) which suggest separating relations (‘LINKs’) from markables. LINKs can be used to annotate any form of semantic relations (indeed, the same notion was used in the TimeML annotation of temporal relations). A structured link, an innovation of MATE, can represent ambiguity (Poesio &amp; Artstein, 2005). In (4), for example, the antecedent of the pronoun realized by markable ne03 in utterance 3.3 could be either engine E2 or the boxcar at Elmira; with the MATE scheme, coders can mark their uncertainty. 4.

Since TUBaD/Z was intended to be used for parser training, it was not a desirable option. Arguments and adjuncts are thus related to their predicates by means of functional labels. In contrast to the Penn Treebank, TUBa-D/Z assigns grammatical functions to all arguments and adjuncts. Due to the freer word order functions cannot be derived from relative positions only. The choice of labels of grammatical functions is largely based on the insight that grammatical functions in German are directly related to the case assignment (Reis 1982). The labels therefore do not refer to grammatical functions such as subject, direct object or indirect object but make a distinction between complement and adjunct functions and classify the nominal complements according to their case marking: accusative object (OA), dative object (OD), genitive object (OG), and also nominative &apos;object&apos; (ON) versus verbal modifier (V-MOD) or underspecified modifier (MOD).

Alternatively, a head is selected on theoretical or heuristic grounds (the head of the first the conjunct, the conjunction, etc.) When working with multiple frameworks, a user must adjust for the assumptions of each framework. 3.2 Gap Filling Mechanisms It is well-known that there are several equivalent ways to represent long distance and lexically based dependencies, e.g., (Sag and Fodor, 1994). Re-entrant graphs (graphs with shared structure), empty category/antecedent pairs, representations of discontinuous constituents, among other mechanisms can all be used to represent that there is some relation R between two (or more) elements in a linguistic structure that is, in some sense, noncanonical. The link by any of these mechanisms can be used to show that the relation R holds in spite of violations of a proximity constraint (long distance dependencies), a special construction such as control, or many other conditions.

For example, if a token give is tagged as VBP in the Penn Treebank, VBP would be converted into VERB.anysubc.pres. If another token give was tagged VB in Brown, VB would be converted to VERB.anysubc{infin,n3pres} (n3pres = not-3rdperson and present tense). This allows systems to acquire the maximum information from corpora, tagged by different research groups. CKIP Chinese-Treebank (CCTB) and Penn Chinese Treebank (PCTB) are two important resources for Treebank-derived Chinese NLP tasks (CKIP, 1995; Xia et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004). CCTB is developed in traditional Chinese (BIG5-encoded) at the Academia Sinica, Taiwan (Chen et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2003). CCTB uses the Informationbased Case Grammar (ICG) framework to express both syntactic and semantic descriptions. The present version CCTB3 (Version 3) provides 61,087 Chinese sentences, 361,834 words and 6 files that are bracketed and post-edited by humans based on a 5-million-word tagged Sinica Corpus (CKIP, 1995). CKIP POS tagging is a hierarchical system. The first POS layers include eight main syntactic categories, i.e. N (noun)</context>

It is developed at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). The PCTB annotates Chinese texts with syntactic bracketing, part of speech information, empty categories and function tags (Xia et al, 2000, 2002, 2005). The predicate-argument structure of Chinese verbs for the PCTB is encoded in the Penn Chinese Proposition Bank (Xue, et. Al. 2005). The present version PCTB5.1 (PCTB Version 5.1), contains 18,782 sentences, 507,222 words, 824,983 Hanzi and 890 data files. PCTB’s bracketing annotation is in the same framework as other Penn Treebanks, bearing a loose connection to the Government and Binding Theory paradigm. The PCTB annotation scheme involves 33 POS-tags, 17 phrasal tags, 6 verb compound tags, 7 empty category tags and 26 functional tags. Table 2 includes Top-Layer/Bottom-Layer PO</context>
