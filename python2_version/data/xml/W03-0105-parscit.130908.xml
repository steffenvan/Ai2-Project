Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999800588235294">
The task of named entity annotation of unseen
text has recently been successfully automated
with near-human performance.
But the full task involves more than annotation,
i.e. identifying the scope of each (continuous)
text span and its class (such as place name). It
also involves grounding the named entity (i.e.
establishing its denotation with respect to the
world or a model). The latter aspect has so far
been neglected.
In this paper, we show how geo-spatial named
entities can be grounded using geographic co-
ordinates, and how the results can be visual-
ized using off-the-shelf software. We use this
to compare a “textual surrogate” of a newspa-
per story, with a “visual surrogate” based on
geographic coordinates.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999826666666667">
The task of named entity annotation of unseen text
has recently been successfully automated, achiev-
ing near-human performance using machine learning
(Zheng and Su, 2002). But many applications also re-
quire grounding – i.e., associating each classified text
span with a referent in the world or some model thereof.
The current paper discusses spatial grounding of named
entities that may be referentially ambiguous, using a min-
imality heuristic that is informed by external geographic
knowledge sources. We then apply these ideas to the cre-
ation of “visual surrogates” for news articles.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses
how spatial named entities can be grounded and how this
interacts with their extraction and applications. Section
3 describes a geo-spatial resolution algorithm. Section 4
shows how maps can be automatically constructed from
named-entity tagged newswire text using resolved place
names, hence introducing a new, graphical document sur-
rogate. Section 5 deals with the usefulness of grounded
named entities for question answering. Section 6 presents
some related work, and Section 7 concludes this paper.

Gazetteers are large lists of names of geographic entities,
usually enriched with further information, such as their
class (e.g., town, river, dam, etc.), their size, and their
location (i.e. with respect to some relative or absolute
coordinate system such as longitude and latitude).
Appendix A identifies some publicly available sources.
UN-LOCODE is the official gazetteer by the United
Nations; it is also freely available from the UNECE Web
sites and contains more than 36 000 locations in 234
countries (UNECE, 1998). The Alexandria Gazetteer
(Smith et al., 1996; Frew et al., 1998) is another database
of geographical entities, including both their coor-
dinates and relationships such as: in-state-of,
in-province-of, in-county-of,
in-country-of, in-region-of, part-of
and formerly-known-as.
To date, Named Entity Recognition (NER) has only
used gazetteers as evidence that a text span could be some
kind of place name (LOCATION), even though their finite
nature makes lists of names of limited use for classifica-
tion (Mikheev et al., 1999). Here we use them for spatial
grounding – relating linguistic entities of subtype LOCA-
TION (Grishman and Sundheim, 1998) to their real-world
counterparts.
“World Atlases” and the gazetteers that index them are
not the only resources than can be used for grounding
spatial terms. In biomedicine, there are are several
brain atlases of different species, using various different
techniques, and focussing on both normal and disease
state; as well as a digital atlas of the human body

based on data from the Visible Human project. Such
atlases and the nomenclatures that label their parts,
provide an important resource for biomedical research
and clinical diagnosis. For example, the Mouse Atlas
(Ringwald et al., 1994) comprises a sequence of 3D
(volumetric) reconstructions of the mouse embryo in
each of its 26 Theiler States of development. Indexing
it is an part-of hierarchy of anatomical terms (such
as embryo.organsystem.cardiovascularsystem-
.heart.atrium), called the Mouse Anatomical
Nomenclature (MAN). Each term is mapped to one or
more sets of adjacent voxels2 that constitute the term’s
denotation in the embryo. Figure 1 illustrate this linkage
(using 2D cross-sections) in the EMAGE database.3
Just as one might find it useful for information extrac-
tion or question answering to ground grographic terms
found in previously unseen text, one may also find it use-
ful to ground anatomical terms in previously unseen text.
One example of this would be in providing support for the
curation of the Gene Expression Database (GXD).4 This
support could come in the form of a named entity recog-
nizer for anatomical parts in text, with grounding against
the Mouse Atlas, using the gazetteer-like information in
the MAN.
So what is the relationship between a place name
gazetteer like UN-LOCODE and the Mouse Atlas? The
MAN is structured in a similar part-of hierarchy to
that of geographical locations:

Because both gazetteers like UN-LOCODE and biomed-

ing for linguistic terms (Figure 2), both can be used to
reason about spatio-temporal settings of a discourse, for
instance, to resolve referential ambiguity.

3 Place-Name Resolution for Information
Extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99782770212766">
There are many places that share the same (Berlin, Ger-
many Berlin, WI, USA) or similar names (York, UK
New York, USA), usually because historically, the
founders of a new town had given it a similar or the same
name as the place they emigrated from.
When ambiguous place names are used in conversa-
tion or in text, it is usually clear to the hearer what spe-
cific referent is intended. First, speaker and hearer usu-
ally share some extra-linguistic context and implicitly ad-
here to Grice’s Cooperative Principle and the “maxims”
that follow, which require a speaker to provide more iden-
tifying information about a location that the recipient is
believed to be unfamiliar with. Secondly, linguistic con-
text can provide clues: an accident report on the road
between Perth and Dundee promotes an interpretation of
Perth in Scotland, while an accident on the road between
Perth and Freemantle promotes an interpretation of Perth
in Western Australia. Computers, which are bound to se-
lect referents algorithmically, can exploit linguistic con-
text more easily than extra-linguistic context, but even the
use of linguistic context requires (as always) some subtle
heuristic reasoning.
Grounding place names mentioned in a text can sup-
port effective visualization – for instance, in a multimedia
document surrogate that contains textual, video and map
elements (e.g. in a question answering scenario), where
we want to ensure that the video shows the region and the
map is centered around the places mentioned.
To make use of linguistic context in resolving am-
biguous place names, we apply two different minimal-
ity heuristics (Gardent and Webber, 2001). The first we
borrow (slightly modified) from work in automatic word
sense disambiguation (Gale et al., 1992), calling it “one
referent per discourse”. It assumes that a place name
mentioned in a discourse refers to the same location
throughout the discourse, just as a word is assumed to
be used in the same one sense throughout the discourse.
Neither is logically necessary, and hence both are simply
interpretational biases.
The second minimality heuristic assumes that, in cases
where there is more than one place name mentioned in
some span of text, the smallest region that is able to
ground the whole set is the one that gives them their inter-
pretation.5 This can be used to resolve referential ambi-
guity by proximity: i.e., not only is the place name Berlin
taken to denote the same Berlin throughout a discourse
unless mentioned otherwise,6 but so does a Potsdam men-

5 Probably the smaller the span, the more often valid will this
heuristic be.
6 This paper is a rare exception due to its meta-linguistic na-
ture.

tioned together with a Berlin uniquely select the capital
of Germany as the likely referent from the set of all can-

To illustrate this “spatial minimality” heuristic, con-
sider Figure 3: Assume that a mention of place A in a
text could either refer to A or A. If the text also con-
tains terms that ground unambiguously to I, J, and K, we
assume the referent of A is Arather than Abecause the
former leads to a smaller spatial context.
To use this “spatial minimality” heuristic, we start by
extracting all place names using a named entity recog-
nizer. We then look up the “confusion set” of potential
referents for each place name, e.g. for Berlin: Berlin,
FRG (German capital); Berlin, WI, USA; Berlin, NJ,
USA; Berlin, CT, USA; Berlin, NH, USA; Berlin, GA,
USA; Berlin, IL, USA; Berlin, NY, USA; Berlin, ND,
USA; Berlin, NJ, USA. Each member of the set of po-
tential referents is associated with its spatial coordinates
(longitude/latitude), using a gazetteer. We then compute
the cross-product of all the confusion sets. (Each mem-
ber of the cross-product contains one potential referent
for each place name, along with its spatial coordinates.)
For each member of the cross-product, we compute the
area of the minimal polygon bounding all the potential
referents, and select as the intended interpretation, the
one with the smallest area.8 The resulting behaviour is

shown in Figure 4: depending on contextually mentioned
other places, a different Berlin is selected.
The value of this heuristic needs to be assessed quanti-
tatively against various types of text.
In resolving anatomical designators in text, we may
employ a variation of the spatial minimality heuristic,
based on the fact that no listing will ever be complete
with respect to all the existing or new-minted synonyms
for anatomical terms.
When grounding the anatomical terms in the text
In subsequent stages until birth, cytokeratin 8
continues to be expressed in embryonic taste
buds distributed in punctuate patterns at regu-
lar intervals along rows that are symmetrically
located on both sides of the median sulcus in
the dorsal anterior developing tongue.
we find no median sulcus within the MAN, only alveo-
lar sulcus, optic sulcus, pre-otic sulcus, sulcus limitans
and sulcus terminalis. We just assume that all anatomi-
cal terms refer to previously recognized anatomical enti-
ties, just as we assume that all geographic terms refer to
existing geographic entities and not, for example, some
new town called “Berlin” or “London” that is not yet in
the gazetteer. Hence median sulcus is assumed to be a
synonym for one of the five sulci given in the MAN. At
this point, we can invoke the spatial minimality heuris-
tic, looking for the minimal bounding space that includes
tongue and one of the five sulci, here yielding “sulcus
terminalis”. Thus the spatial minimality heuristic is here
pairwise point-point distances, or symbolically, using a hierar-
chical gazetteer’s relations, such as in-region-of.

4 Visualization of Geo-Spatial Aspects in
Narrative
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999561904761905">
The usefulness of visual representations to
convey information is widely recognized (cf.
(Larkin and Simon, 1987)). Here, we use the grounding
of named entities in news stories to create a visual
surrogate that represents their “spatial aboutness”.
Two news stories were selected from online newspa-
pers on the same day (2003-02-21): one story (Appendix
B) reports the tragic death of a baby from London in a
Glasgow hospital despite flying it to a Glasgow special-
ist hospital in the Royal aircraft (BBC News, 2003), and
the other report (Appendix C) describes the search of the
Californian police for a pregnant women from Modesto,
CA, who has disappeared (The Mercury News, 2003).
We use the term “surrogate” to refer to a partial view
of a text (e.g. (Leidner, 2002)). Figure 5 shows a tex-
tual surrogate in the form of all place names found in a
text: an analyst who wants to get a quick overview about
the locations involved in some item of news reportage, to
decide its local interest or relevance, might find such a
surrogate helpful, although the source would still have to
be skim-read.

We now compare this “baseline” textual surrogate to a

introduced before. Our simple visualisation method com-

From the text we obtain a vector of types of all spatial
named entities with their frequency of occurrence in the
text:
For simplicity, we drop those that correspond to regions
(which are represented by sets of points) and feed the
remaining list of point coordinates (corresonding to vil-
lages and cities) into a map generator to generate a Mer-
cator projection of the geographical area that includes all
the points plus 10% of the surrounding area. For this, The
Generic Map Tools (GMT)10 were used, in this case via
HTTP.11

pendix B12 Figure 9 shows the map for the story in Ap-

respect to comprehension time than the textual surrogate
presented before. It is interesting so see what happens
if we leave out the final paragraph for the map creation
(Figure 8): we obtain a “zoomed-in” version of the map.
This turns out to be the case for many stories and is due
to the convention of news reportage to close a report with
linking the narrative to similar events in order to present
the event in a wider context.

answers to where-questions depends on the reference
points of speaker and listener (Where is the Empire State

on such levels of granularity in the sense that to create a

such questions should not be based on textual extraction

Whereas a lot of work has been done in the area of spa-
tial databases (Shekhar et al., 1999; Freytag et al., 2000;
Paredaens, 1995; Paredaens and Kuijpers, 1998), little
attention seems to have been given so far to the problem
of generating maps from text or annotating maps with in-

The work presented here perhaps most closely
resembles that of (Mackinlay, 1986; Casner, 1990;
Roth and Hefley, 1993) who describe systems that gen-
erate multimedial representations, potentially including
maps, but from a formalized knowledge source rather
than unstructured text, and (Waldinger et al., 2002), who

7 Summary and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999651828571429">
Rich gazetteers can be helpful in determining unique
geospatial referents and have many applications.
Starting with a description of how spatial named enti-
ties can be grounded in the physical world using gazetteer
knowledge in two different domains, we have described
a heuristic method to resolve place names using such
gazetteers.
We have then applied our method to the task of draw-
ing maps from text automatically. These (geo-)graphical
document surrogates give an overview about where a re-
ported news event takes place. We do not know of pre-
vious attempts to create geographical maps automatically
from unconstrained newswire text.
Many venues for further research can be conceived,
for instance, a finer granularity of analysis could reveal
more named entity classes (including e.g. brigdges and
other artifacts) and their relative ortientation. Maps as
created here could also be used to produce an animation
from multiple documents (with different time-stamps) on
the same topic to illustrate how the importance of places
shifts over time, which could aid analysts in their timely
identification of regions of crisis.

“We would like to say thank you for all the care Khola has
received,” they said in a statement.
“We wish to thank the hospital staff in Glasgow and London,
the team who transported Khola, and the Queen for allowing the
use of her plane. We also wish to thank everyone who prayed
for our daughter.”
Khola was taken to Yorkhill Hospital An RAF Hercules had
initially been scheduled to take the baby to Glasgow last month.
However, it burst a tyre as it landed at Northolt.
It was then decided to fly the baby and the medical team to
Glasgow in an aircraft from the Royal Squadron.
The four-engine British Aerospace 146 was the same aircraft
used for the Queen’s Jubilee Tour of Britain last year.
A Royal Navy helicopter at Prestwick was mobilised and
flown in bad weather to RAF Northolt where the specialist med-
ical team on board was transferred to St George’s Hospital in
Tooting.
The baby was stabilised in an incubator throughout the night
before the transfer to Glasgow. Doctors at Yorkhill said Khola
had been in need of respiratory support.
Four hospitals in the UK can provide extracorporeal mem-
brane oxygenation (ECMO) for breathing difficulties, but Glas-
gow was the only hospital able to accommodate Khola.
The process involves taking the baby’s blood out of the body,
through an artificial lung and pumping it back in, allowing the
baby’s lungs to rest.
The media circus was only the latest in a long line that have
sprung up around high-profile criminal cases, where the news
is scant but the demand for information – even the smallest
morsel – soars off the charts. “People have been interested in
this type of story since pre-biblical times,” said Joe Saltzman,
associate dean at the Annenberg School for Communications at
the University of Southern California. “We live in a global vil-
lage where everyone is our neighbor, and this is an interesting
story about a man whose pregnant wife is kidnapped.”
As Modesto police completed their second day combing
through the home that missing mother-to-be Laci Peterson
shared with her husband, Scott, more than a dozen news crews
from Los Angeles to Sacramento camped out front. Many of the
reporters huddled under a tent hastily erected by one reporter as
it rained and hailed.
Detective Doug Ridenour said Wednesday that investigators
had completed their work, removing about 95 bags of evidence.
On Tuesday, Amy Rocha, the sister of the missing woman, ac-
companied detectives into the modest three-bedroom home for
about two hours. But on Wednesday, investigators worked alone
– completing their task about 5 p.m. They also planned to do a
walk-through with Scott Peterson.
“We’ve been able to accomplish a lot,” Ridenour told re-
porters at the Peterson house. “But here at this point we just
don’t have the significant evidence we need to find Laci or to
move in another direction.”
Ridenour would not reveal when detectives would analyze
what they took away or when they would release a detailed de-
scription of what they found.
He also repeated a familiar refrain: Scott Peterson is not a
suspect, but he has not been ruled out as one. Suspicion has
hovered over Peterson since his wife vanished Dec. 24, a day
he said he was fishing at the Berkeley Marina 85 miles away.
[...]
Kornberg, who is best known for representing a man the pub-
lic loved to hate—Joey Buttafuoco, who had a torrid affair with
Long Island teenager Amy Fisher – said the only way to end
such sideshows is to convert the American system of justice “to
the English system, where you announce the arrest of an indi-
vidual and then you announce the verdict when it’s over.”

<abstract confidence="0.9981475">The task of named entity annotation of unseen text has recently been successfully automated with near-human performance. But the full task involves more than annotation, i.e. identifying the scope of each (continuous) text span and its class (such as place name). It also involves grounding the named entity (i.e. establishing its denotation with respect to the world or a model). The latter aspect has so far been neglected. In this paper, we show how geo-spatial named entities can be grounded using geographic coordinates, and how the results can be visualized using off-the-shelf software. We use this to compare a “textual surrogate” of a newspaper story, with a “visual surrogate” based on geographic coordinates.</abstract>

(Larkin and Simon, 1987)). Here, we use the grounding of named entities in news stories to create a visual surrogate that represents their “spatial aboutness”. Two news stories were selected from online newspapers on the same day (2003-02-21): one story (Appendix B) reports the tragic death of a baby from London in a Glasgow hospital despite flying it to a Glasgow specialist hospital in the Royal aircraft (BBC News, 2003), and the other report (Appendix C) describes the search of the Californian police for a pregnant women from Modesto, CA, who has disappeared (The Mercury News, 2003). We use the term “surrogate” to refer to a partial view of a text (e.g. (Leidner, 2002)). Figure 5 shows a textual surrogate in the form of all place names found in a text: an analyst who wants to get a quick overview about the locations involved in some item of news reportage, to decide its local interest or relevance, might find such a surrogate helpful, although the source would still have to be skim-read.

Appendix A identifies some publicly available sources. UN-LOCODE is the official gazetteer by the United Nations; it is also freely available from the UNECE Web sites and contains more than 36 000 locations in 234 countries (UNECE, 1998). The Alexandria Gazetteer (Smith et al., 1996; Frew et al., 1998) is another database of geographical entities, including both their coordinates and relationships such as: in-state-of, in-province-of, in-county-of, in-country-of, in-region-of, part-of and formerly-known-as. To date, Named Entity Recognition (NER) has only used gazetteers as evidence that a text span could be some kind of place name (LOCATION), even though their finite nature makes lists of names of limited use for classification (Mikheev et al., 1999).

Indexing it is an part-of hierarchy of anatomical terms (such as embryo.organsystem.cardiovascularsystem.heart.atrium), called the Mouse Anatomical Nomenclature (MAN).

(Larkin and Simon, 1987)). Here, we use the grounding of named entities in news stories to create a visual surrogate that represents their “spatial aboutness”. Two news stories were selected from online newspapers on the same day (2003-02-21): one story (Appendix B) reports the tragic death of a baby from London in a Glasgow hospital despite flying it to a Glasgow specialist hospital in the Royal aircraft (BBC News, 2003), and the other report (Appendix C) describes the search of the Californian police for a pregnant women from Modesto, CA, who has disappeared (The Mercury News, 2003). We use the term “surrogate” to refer to a partial view of a text (e.g. (Leidner, 2002)). Figure 5 shows a textual surrogate in the form of all place names found in a text: an analyst who wants to get a quick overview about the locations involved in some item of news reportage, to decide its local interest or relevance, might find such a surrogate helpful, although the source would still have to be skim-read.
