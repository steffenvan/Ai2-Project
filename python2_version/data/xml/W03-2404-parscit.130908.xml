This paper reports on the conversion
of the TIGER treebank, a syntactically
interpreted corpus of German newspa-
per texts, into a testsuite for a broad-
coverage Lexical-Functional Gram mar
(LFG) for German. This is done by
first converting the TIGER XML rep-
resentation into a relational Prolog-like
representation and then applying term-
rewriting rules as they are used in certain
MT transfer components to that repre-
sentation. The output consists of (partly
underspecified) f-structures, which can
then be mapped against the grammar&apos;s
output for evaluation purposes.

In grammar development, one is often confronted
with the dilemma that coverage, efficiency, lin-
guistic adequacy and the reduction of ambigui-
ties are conflicting goals. At present, a linguist
involved in the development of a broad-coverage
grammar such as the German ParGraml LFG is
additionally limited by the absence of large an-
notated testsuites, when wanting to evaluate the
grammar thoroughly or when trying to find out in
how far grammar modifications affect one of the
above features due to inexpected interactions. Of
I ParGram is a joint research project on the parallel devel-
opment of large-scale grammars for several languages involv-
ing PARC, Fuji Xerox, the University of Bergen, the Univer-
sity of Manchester and the University of Stuttgart.
course, it is possible to run the grammar on large
corpora and to state afterwards what percentage of
the sentences in a given corpus got at least one
analysis (E.g., the German ParGram LFG parses
54.8% of the NEGRA corpus.), how many sen-
tences timed out or failed because of storage over-
flow (1.2%) and what percentage was not parsed
(44%). It is virtually impossible, however, to de-
termine whether the intended analysis is among
the often extremely numerous analyses proposed
by the grammar, nor can we really test what the
exact consequences of grammar modifications are.
In order to evaluate systematically whether and
how one of the features mentioned above can be
improved without decreasing its performance with
respect to another one, it is necessary to make use
of large testsuites that be annotated according to
the formalism used. Since the manual annota-
tion of such testsuites would be extremely time-
consuming, it seems reasonable to use an existing
treebank, the TIGER corpus in our case, and to
convert it to the format we need, which is the one
of LFG f-structures.
Similar efforts of f-structure annotation of tree-
banks have been reported on in Van Genabith et al.
(1999), Sadler et al. (2000), Frank (2000), Frank
et al. (2001), Van Genabith et al. (2001), and
Cahill et al. (2002). As in all that work the source
format (AP corpus, Susanne corpus, Penn tree-
bank) differs considerably from the TIGER format
in that it encodes mainly phrase-structural infor-
mation, our approach is quite different, however,
from the ones mentioned. Dependency informa-
tion being expressed explicitly in the edge labels,

we do not need to f-annotate the treebank (or a
context-free grammar extracted from it), but we
can directly convert the hybrid TIGER representa-
tion into f-structures.
Another related work is Frank (2001), which
consists of the extraction of an LTAG from the NE-
GRA corpus. Here, the source format is compara-
ble to ours, the TIGER format being an extension
of the NEGRA format, and the main differences
with respect to our work are due to the different
target format. For the conversion of the corpus to
a collection of f-structures, constituency informa-
tion is almost irrelevant, whereas it is crucial for
the extraction of an LTAG.
Finally, our conversion is, of course, in many
ways similar to the inverse conversion from LFG
analyses to TIGER trees (Zinsmeister et al., 2002).
E.g. we use the same term-rewriting system. How-
ever, since the relation between TIGER trees and
f-structures is far from being a one-to-one map-
ping, it raises new questions. Moreover, we aim at
converting the entire TIGER treebank into an &apos;f-
structure bank&apos; without any human intervention,
an objective that is quite different from grammar-
based treebank annotation.
Our presentation of the conversion process is or-
ganized as follows. Section 2 describes the first
step in the process, which is the transformation of
TIGER trees into feature structures. In section 3
we present the transfer system we use for the trans-
formation of TIGER-like feature structures into f-
structures, as well as a number of transfer phe-
noma and their treatment in that formalism. Fi-
nally, section 4 gives an outlook on the possibil-
ities for future work offered by the resulting f-
structure bank.

2 The TIGER treebank and the

per sentences. The annotation consists of general-
ized graphs, i.e. trees which may contain crossing
and secondary edges. Edges are labeled, so that a
TIGER tree encodes both phrase-structural infor-
mation and information on dependency relations.2
The TIGER trees are represented in a specific
XML format, the so-called TIGER XML.3 Figure
2 illustrates what the TIGER XML representation
of an annotated sentence like the one in figure 1
looks like.
In order to be able to use an existing term-
rewriting system for the conversion of the TIGER
trees into f-structures, we first need to have the
TIGER corpus available in a relational Prolog-
like representation. Instead of being a generalized
graph, a TIGER tree then has to take the form of a
feature structure.
This conversion raises a first problem: In a
TIGER tree, there can be several identically la-
belled edges that go from one single node to vari-
ous of its daughter nodes. In feature structures, on
the contrary, a given attribute can only have one
unique value. It is thus not possible to convert a
TIGER tree into a feature structure by a one-to-
one mapping. Fortunately, there is quite a straight-
forward solution to this problem: As attributes in
a feature structure can be set-valued, all identi-
cally labeled daughter nodes of a given node can
be put into a set. The resulting representation dif-
fers somewhat from the initial tree, but it contains
basically the same information.
Another problem that we need to deal with
when converting TIGER trees into feature struc-
tures is the fact that, generally, the latter do not en-
code any information about precedence relations.
This kind of information can be crucial, however,
for subsequent steps in the conversion from one
format to the other. Genitive attributes, for ex-
ample, are labeled AG in the TIGER treebank,
whether they are on the left or on the right of their
head noun. The broad-coverage LFG for German,
on the contrary, analyzes them in two different
ways, either as a SPEC POSS, when they are in
prenominal position, or as a member of the set-
valued feature ADJUNCT, when they appear post-

nominally. This means that a minimum of infor-
mation about precedence needs to be encoded in
the relational TIGER representation.
This can be done with the help of a special pred-
icate that allows us to state that a certain node A
precedes another node B. By means of this predi-
cate, called &apos;scopes&apos; in the system we use, we ex-
press precedence relations between daughters of
the same mother node. This kind of information
is sufficient to disambiguate all TIGER-LFG mis-
matches which can be disambiguated on the basis
of precedence information.
The first step of the conversion of TIGER trees
into f-structures thus consists of transforming the
trees into feature structures. As this task does not
require any major structural changes, it can be car-
ried out quite comfortably by means of an XSL
style sheet4. Figure 3 shows an excerpt of the
relational Prolog-like representation of the corpus
sentence displayed in 1 that results from the XSL
conversion of the TIGER XML representation il-
lustrated in figure 2. Figure 4 displays the corre-
sponding feature structure.

Although the f-structures we obtain from our
broad-coverage LFG and the TIGER treebank rep-
resentations coincide in core aspects, e.g. the en-
coding of grammatical functions, there are mis-
matches in analysis details that are comparable to
translation mismatches in natural language trans-

lation. One such phenomenon is the flat anal-
ysis of auxiliary constructions generally adopted
in LFG versus the intricate analysis that has been
chosen for the TIGER treebank. This kind of mis-
matches motivates the use of transfer technology
originally developed for machine translation.

3.1 The transfer system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921466666667">
The transfer system we use is a term rewriting sys-
tem based on Prolog. It has originally been devel-
oped by Martin Kay and is now part of the XLE
grammar development platform. The rules it pro-
cesses are ordered, which means that the output of
a given rule ri is input to rule r i+ . Each rule
replaces a certain set of predicates (those on the
left-hand side of the rule) by another set of predi-
cates (those on its right-hand side). Input and out-
put predicates are separated by a rewriting symbol,
the operator &apos;==&gt;&apos;. The most basic rules simply
rewrite the name of the predicate and pass on the
values of the arguments unchanged. For example,
the rule given in (1) maps the TIGER edge label
OA (accusative object) to the LFG function OBJ.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.806795">
(1) oa(X,Y) ==&gt; obj(X,Y).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.983215952380952">
In addition, it is possible to specify predicates
on the left-hand side that have to be matched, but
are not replaced (marked with a &apos;+&apos;), as well as
predicates that must not be matched for the rule
to be applied (marked with a &apos;-&apos;). These mecha-
nisms are used in the following rule, which takes
a partial feature structure whose attribute TI-POS
has the value PIAT (for &apos;attributive indefinite pro-
noun&apos;) out of the set that is the value of the feature
NK (for &apos;noun kernel&apos;) and attributes it to a new
feature SPEC QUANT, if that feature does not yet
exist.
(2) +nk(A,SET), in_set(B,SET),
+ti_pos(B,&apos;PIAT&apos;), -spec(A,_)
==&gt;
spec(A,SPES), quant(SPEC,B).
It is also possible to delete features by writing a
zero on the right-hand side of a rule, which stands
for the empty set. In this case, all predicates on the
left-hand side of the rule are deleted from the set
of terms without replacement.

<bodyText confidence="0.998456181818182">
Finally, the possibility of defining rules as op-
tional needs to be mentioned as well. Optional
rules are characterized by the use of the operator
&apos;?=&gt;&apos; instead of &apos;==&gt;&apos;. They allow us to transfer a
given input feature structure to two alternative out-
put structures - or more, if several optional rules
are applied. We can thus handle cases where we
cannot clearly decide on the sole basis of the in-
put what the output must look like. The TIGER
label MO (for &apos;modifier&apos;), for example, is such
a phenomenon, because the context is not always

sufficient to determine whether it is to be trans-
ferred to an element of the set-valued feature AD-
JUNCT, to an OBL-DIR (directional oblique), an
OBL-LOC (locative oblique) or still another gram-
matical function. The following rule optionnally
transfers a MO-PP with an AC (the edge label used
for pre- and postpositions in TIGER) that has the
form &apos;nach&apos; into an OBL-DIR.

For reasons of userfriendliness and maintain-
ability, the XLE transfer system also allows the
use of templates and macros. They are short-hand
notations for sets of rules and predicates respec-
tively. As they are not directly relevant for our pre-
sentation, however, we do not present them here in
more detail.

3.2 Transfer phenomena
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903384615385">
Unlike transfer in machine translation, the trans-
fer from TIGER trees to LFG f-structures does
not aim at changing the surface string. The task
is rather to map a limited set of grammatical fea-
tures into another limited set of grammatical fea-
tures. Nevertheless, the format conversion is far
more complex than a simple mapping from one
feature set to another, because (i) there is no one-
to-one correspondence between features and (ii)
the different analyses chosen for certain grammat-
ical phenomena can have relatively heavy reper-
cussions on the structure of the representations in-
volved.

3.2.1 Ambiguous edge labels
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980666666667">
In section 2, we mentioned the case of the
TIGER edge label AG, which depending on the
position of the AG constituent with respect to its
head noun corresponds to either a SPEC POSS
feature or an ADJUNCT feature in a German LFG
analysis. Still, this kind of ambiguity can easily
be resolved on the basis of precedence informa-
tion, so that we simply need two obligatory rules
for the transfer of AGs, one for prenominal ones
and a &apos;default rule&apos; for postnominal ones. As rules
are ordered, the &apos;default rule&apos; is only applied, if the
more specific rule was not.

A somewhat more complex case is the trans-
fer of the predicate MO. It can correspond to the
predicates ADJUNCT, OBL-DIR and OBL-LOC.
This is due to the fact that PPs such as auf dem
Operationstisch in corpus sentence no. 23747 are
analysed as subcategorized arguments in the Ger-
man LFG (cf. figure 7), and not as ADJUNCTs or
MOs respectively, as it is the case in the TIGER
treebank (cf. figure 1).
We deal with this case by first using the optional
rule in (6a), which similarly to the one in (4) con-
verts a MO into an OBL-LOC, and then applying
the default rule given in (6b), which transfers all
MOs to ADJUNCTs. In order not to obtain too
many output f-structures, we try to limit the appli-
cation of the optional rules to as few contexts as is
reasonably possible, while keeping them general
enough to cover all cases that we need for a justifi-
able comparison of the output of the German LFG
and the TIGER annotation.

taining the non-finite main verb form is analysed
as a clausal object (OC) of the auxiliary. Figure

This kind of structural change is known as head-
switching in the field of machine translation. As
studies about the treatment of head-switching phe-
nomena have shown, they can be dealt with with-
out major difficulty by a term-rewriting system.
Another phenomenon for which structural
changes have to be made on the way from a
TIGER tree representation to an f-structure is the
attachment of ADJUNCTs or MOs respectively
that modify a verb which is embedded under a
modal verb. For the German LFG it has been de-
cided that this kind of ADJUNCT is a feature of
the outer f-structure and not of the partial XCOMP
f-structure within it. This analysis helps to avoid
a systematic ambiguity, which would arise if the
attachment to both the outer and the embedded
verb were allowed, but which generally is not of
importance from a semantic point of view. In
TIGER, according to its annotation principles, a
MO is always attached where it belongs semanti-
cally, which means that in most cases it is embed-
ded in the TIGER counterpart of XCOMP, namely
OC (for &apos;clausal object&apos;); in unclear cases, it is at-
tached as low as possible. This difference in ad-
junct attachment can be observed in in figures 1
and 7 with respect to the PP bei seiner Morgen-
toilette.
Again, this and all other kinds of structural
changes needed for the conversion of TIGER trees
into f-structures can be handled quite comfortably

1-structure bank&apos; in grammar
development
Preliminary experiments in view of the conversion
of the whole TIGER treebank are very encourag-
ing. A thorough evaluation of the transfer qual-
ity, in which we will manually check the transfer
result for 200 randomly selected sentences from
the TIGER corpus that can be parsed by the Ger-
man ParGram LFG, is still to be carried out. Open
questions are mainly the exact treatment of sec-
ondary edges, which for the moment are converted
just like normal edges, as well as the conversion
of parenthetical and elliptical constructions. This
kind of constructions being rather marginal, we
hope to have converted a large part of the TIGER
treebank into an f-structure bank by the time of the
workshop.
Having this large German f-structure bank
available will make it possible to evaluate the Ger-
man ParGram LFG in a much more informative
way than this can be done at the moment. No
longer will we be restricted to observing what per-
centage of a given corpus can be parsed by the
grammar, what proportion fails due to timeout or
storage overflow and what percentage is rejected,
but we will have the means to determine whether
the desired analysis is among the analyses pro-
posed by the grammar and whether it is among

the preferred solutions.5 For the first time, we
will have a detailed picture of how good (or bad)
the analyses are which the German ParGram LFG
proposes, and it will no longer be a problem to
control the repercussions of grammar modifica-
tions intended to increase coverage, for example,
on parsing quality, efficiency etc.
Last but not least, the resulting f-structure bank
will be indispensable for the supervised training of
statistical disambiguation modules. Actually, we
plan to employ exponential models on ambiguous
LFG parses along the lines of Crouch et al. (2002).
In conclusion, treebanking along with treebank
conversion opens up a whole series of new possi-
bilities for the development of fine-grained syntac-
tic analyzers. Most importantly, it will permit the
use of probabilistic disambiguation based on su-

tion method, which prefers or disprefers certain solutions

pervised training and facilitate detailed grammar
evaluation. And as it should be relatively easy to
adapt our treebank conversion approach to the rep-
resentations resulting from related syntactic anal-
yses (e.g. HPSG), it might even open the way for
the comparison of different parsers for German.

This is done by first converting the TIGER XML representation into a relational Prolog-like representation and then applying termrewriting rules as they are used in certain MT transfer components to that representation. The output consists of (partly underspecified) f-structures, which can then be mapped against the grammar&apos;s output for evaluation purposes.</abstract>

This kind of information can be crucial, however, for subsequent steps in the conversion from one format to the other. Genitive attributes, for example, are labeled AG in the TIGER treebank, whether they are on the left or on the right of their head noun. The broad-coverage LFG for German, on the contrary, analyzes them in two different ways, either as a SPEC POSS, when they are in prenominal position, or as a member of the setvalued feature ADJUNCT, when they appear post2For more details on the annotation scheme see Skut et al.

This means that a minimum of information about precedence needs to be encoded in the relational TIGER representation. This can be done with the help of a special predicate that allows us to state that a certain node A precedes another node B. By means of this predicate, called &apos;scopes&apos; in the system we use, we express precedence relations between daughters of the same mother node. This kind of information is sufficient to disambiguate all TIGER-LFG mismatches which can be disambiguated on the basis of precedence information. Th</context>

Since the manual annotation of such testsuites would be extremely timeconsuming, it seems reasonable to use an existing treebank, the TIGER corpus in our case, and to convert it to the format we need, which is the one of LFG f-structures. Similar efforts of f-structure annotation of treebanks have been reported on in Van Genabith et al. (1999), Sadler et al. (2000), Frank (2000), Frank et al. (2001), Van Genabith et al. (2001), and Cahill et al. (2002). As in all that work the source format (AP corpus, Susanne corpus, Penn treebank) differs considerably from the TIGER format in that it encodes mainly phrase-structural information, our approach is quite different, however, from the ones mentioned.

Another related work is Frank (2001), which consists of the extraction of an LTAG from the NEGRA corpus. Here, the source format is comparable to ours, the TIGER format being an extension of the NEGRA format, and the main differences with respect to our work are due to the different target format. For the conversion of the corpus to a collection of f-structures, constituency information is almost irrelevant, whereas it is crucial for the extraction of an LTAG. Finally, our conversion is, of course, in many ways similar to the inverse conversion from LFG analyses to TIGER trees (Zinsmeister et al., 2002). E.g. we use the same ter</context>

However, since the relation between TIGER trees and f-structures is far from being a one-to-one mapping, it raises new questions. Moreover, we aim at converting the entire TIGER treebank into an &apos;fstructure bank&apos; without any human intervention, an objective that is quite different from grammarbased treebank annotation. Our presentation of the conversion process is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the first step in the process, which is the transformation of TIGER trees into feature structures.
