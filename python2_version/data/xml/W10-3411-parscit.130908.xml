Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984923076923">
Our work is confined to word access,
that is, we present here our ideas of how to
improve electronic dictionaries in order to
help language producers (speaker/writer)
to find the word they are looking for. Our
approach is based on psychological find-
ings (representation, storage and access of
information in the human mind), observed
search strategies and typical navigational
behavior.
If one agrees with the idea that lex-
ical access (word finding) is basically a
search problem, then one may still want
to find out where and how to search.
While the space, i.e. the semantic map
in which search takes place is a resource
problem,— any of the following could be
used: dictionary, corpus, thesauraus, etc.
or a mix of them,— its exploration is typ-
ically a search problem. Important as it
may be, the building of a high quality re-
source is not the focus of this work, we
rely on an existing one, and while we
are concerned with its quality, we will be
mostly concerned here with search meth-
ods, in order to determine the best.

1 Problem: find the needle in a haystack
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990720292682927">
One of the most vexing problems in speaking or
writing is that one knows a given word, yet one
fails to access it when needed. This kind of search
failure, often referred to as dysnomia or Tip of the
Tongue-problem, occurs not only in communica-
tion, but also in other activities of everyday life.
Being basically a search problem it is likely to oc-
cur whenever we look for something that exists
in real world (objects) or our mind: dates, phone
numbers, past events, peoples’ names, or you just
name it.
As one can see, we are concerned here with the
problem of words, or rather, how to find them in
the place where they are stored: the human brain,
or an external resource, a dictionary. Our work
being confined to lexical access, we would like
to develp a semantic map and a compass to help
language producers to find the word they are look-
ing for. More precisely, we try to build an index
and a navigational tool allowing people to access
words no matter how incomplete their conceptual
input may be. Our approach is based on psy-
chological findings concerning the mental lexicon
(Aitchison, 2003; Levelt et al., 1999), i.e. storage
and access of information in the human mind, ob-
served search strategies and typical navigational
behavior.
2 Consider the following elements before
attempting an engineering solution
Before conceiving a roadmap leading to an en-
gineering solution it may be useful to consider
certain points. The list here below is by no
means complete, neither is the following discus-
sion. Nevertheless we believe that the following
points are worth consideration: features of the
mental lexicon, how to build and use the resource,
searching, ranking and weights, interface prob-
lems. For reasons of space constraints we will
touch briefly only upon some of these points.
Our main goal is the enhancement of electronic
dictionaries to help speakers or writers to find

quickly and intuitively the word they are looking.
To achieve this target we take inspiration in the
findings concerning the human brain (structure,
process) when it tries access words in the mental
lexicon.

While forms (lemma) and meanings (lexical con-
cepts, definitions) are stored side by side in pa-
per dictionaries (holistic presentation), the hu-
man brain stores them differently. The informa-
tion concerning meaning, forms and sound is dis-
tributed across various layers. Lexical fragmen-
tation or information distribution is supported by
many empirical findings,1 and while this fact is
arguably the reason accounting for word access
problems, it is probably also the explanation of
the power and the flexibility of the human mind
which generally manages to find in no time the
right term after having searched for it in a huge
store of words.
While it is still not entirely clear what is stored,
or whether anything is stored at all 2 coming close
to the kind of information generally found in dic-
tionaries, it does seem clear though that the struc-
ture of mental lexicon is a multidimensional net-
work in which the user navigates. ”Entries in the
lexicon are not islands; the lexicon has an inter-
nal structure. Items are connected or related in
various ways...There are item relations within and
between entries.” (Levelt, 1989). While the for-
mer relate meanings and forms: syntactic (part
of speech), morphological, phonological informa-
tion, the latter connect lexical entries.3 In sum,
1Speech errors (Fromkin, 1980), studies on aphasia (Dell
et al., 1997; Blanken et al., 2004) or response times i.e.
chronometric studies (Levelt et al., 1999), neuroimaging
(Shafto et al., 2007; Kikyo et al., 2001), eye movements,
(Roelofs, 2004), experiments on priming (Schvaneveldt et
al., 1976) or the tip of the tongue problem (TOT) (Brown
and McNeill, 1996).
2An important feature of the mental lexicon lies in the
fact that the entries are not accessed but activated (Marslen-
Wilson, 1990; Altmann, 1997). Of course, such a detail can
have far reaching consequences concerning knowledge rep-
resentation and use, i.e. structure and process.
3These are typically the kind of relations we can find in
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), which happens to be quite rich
in this respect, but relatively poor with regard to intrinsic, i.e.
intralexical information.
lexical networks store or encode the information
people typically have with regard to words, and
finding the needed information, amounts to enter
the graph at some point,– in the case of writing or
speaking, usually a node dedicated to meaning,–
and to follow the links until one has reached the
goal (target word). While computer scientists
call this kind of search ’navigation’, psychologists
prefer the term ’activation spreading. While not
being exactly the same, functionally speaking they
are equivalent though.
As every day language experience shows,
things may go wrong, we lack information, hence
we get blocked. Yet when trying to complete the
puzzle we do not start from scratch, we rely on
existing information, which, in terms of the net-
work metaphor means that we start from (infor-
mation underlying) a word being close to the tar-
get word.4
It is interesting to note, that our lexical graphs
seem to have similar characteristics as small-
world networks. These latter are a type of graph
in which most nodes, eventhough not being direct
neighbors, can be reached via a small number of
clicks, about 6, regardless of the starting point.
This property of networks, where objects, or the
nodes standing for them, are highly connected has
first been described by Frigyes Karinthy (1929)
a Hungarian writer, to be tested then many years
later by a social psychologist (Milgram, 1961).
Nodes can be anything, people, words, etc. If they
represent people, than edges specify their relation-
ship, i.e. the very fact that they know each other,
that they are friends, etc. Given this high connec-
tivity, anything seems to be at the distance of a few
mouse clicks. Hence, it is easy to connect peo-
ple or to find out who entertains with whom what
kind of relationship. Obviously, there is a strik-
ing similarity to our lexical graphs, and the small-
world feature has been tested by mathematicians,
who concluded that the distance for words is even
smaller than in the original Milgram experiments,
namely 4 rather than 6. Indeed, (Motter et al.,
2002) and colleagues could show that more than

1996), people always know something concerning the target
word (meaning, form, relation to other words), hence finding
a word in such a situation amounts to puzzle-completion.

2.2 Building the resource
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985769842105263">
There are two elements we need to get a clearer
picture of: the nature of the resource (semantic
map), and the search method i.e. the way to ex-
plore it. Concerning the resource, there are many
possible sources (dictionary, thesaurus, corpora,
or a mix of all this) and many ways of build-
ing it. Since our main goal is the building of
an index based on the notion of word relations
(triples composed of two terms and a link), the
two prime candidates are of course corpora and
association lists like the ones collected by psy-
chologists. While the former are raw data, con-
taining the information in a more or less hidden
form, the latter (often) contain the data explicitely,
but they are scarce, subject to change, and some of
the links are questionable.5
Corpora: Concerning the resource the follow-
ing points deserve consideration: size, representa-
tivity and topic sensitivity.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997688">
• Size or coverage: While size or coverage are
critical variables, they should not be overem-
phasized though, trading quantity against
quality. We need to define the meaning of
quality here, and whether, when or how lack
of quality can be (partially) compensated by
quantity. In other words, we need to define
thresholds. In the absence of clear guidelines
it is probably wise to strive for a good bal-
ance between the two, which again assumes
that we know what quality means.
• Representativity: Obviously, the system we
have in mind is only as good as the data we
use, i.e. the purity/accuracy and represen-
tativity of the word/feature-association lists.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969424916666667">
5This flaw is due to the experimental protocol. Subjects
are asked to give the first word coming to their mind right
after a stimulas. Not having been asked to specify the link it
is the experimenter who does so. Yet, many word pairs,– say,
cat and dog,– allow for various links (love, tease, chase, etc.),
and it is not obvious at all which is the one intended by the
user. This problem could have been avoided to a large extent
if the instruction had been, ”build a sentence containing the
following word”. Another potential problem may be due to
the distance between the source and the target word: the link
may be mediated.
No single set of data (dictionary, corpus, the-
saurus) will ever suffice to capture the knowl-
edge people have. While it would be unreal-
istic to try to model the semantic map of ev-
eryone, it is not unreasonable to try to reach
an average user, say someone who has been
to school and is a computer literate. If we
want to capture the world-knowledge of this
kind of user (target), than we must beware
that it is contained in the material we use,
since our resource will be based on this data.
Hence, taking as corpus only the newspapers
read by an elite (say, Le Monde, in France),
will surely not suffice to capture the informa-
tion we need, as it will not relate information
ordinary citizens, say sport fans, are famil-
iar with or interested in. In sum, we need to
take a wide variety of sources to extract then
the needed information. While there is short-
age of some document types needed, there
are nevertheless quite a few sources one may
consider to begin with: Wikipedia, domain
taxonomies, topic signatures, (Lin and Hovy,
2000), a database like (http://openrdf.org),
etc.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.967582">
• Topic sensitivity
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946421052631">
Weights are important, but they tend to
change dynamically with time and the topic.
Think of the word ’piano’ uttered in the con-
texts of a ’concert’ or ’household moving’. It
is only in this latter case that this term evokes
ideas like size or weight. The dynamic re-
compution of weights as a function of topic
changes requires that the system be able to
recognize the topic changes, as otherwise it
might mislead the user by providing of in-
adequate weights. For some initial work see
(Ferret and Zock, 2006).
Association lists: Psychologists have built such
lists already decades ago (Deese, 1965; Schvan-
eveldt, 1989). Similar lists are nowadays freely
available on the web. For example, for English
there is the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus 6
and the compilation done by Nelson and his col-
leagues in Florida 7. There are also some re-

sources for German (see 8 or 9), for Japanese,10
and probably many other languages.
While association lists are generally built man-
ually, one can also try to do so automatically or
with the help of people (see section 5 in (Zock
and Bilac, 2004)). JeuxdeMot (JdM), a collec-
tively built resource focusing on French being an
example in case.11

2.3 Searching
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966592592593">
The goal of searching is more complex than one
might think. Of course, ultimately one should find
the object one is looking for,12 but the very pro-
cess should also be carried out quickly and natu-
rally. In addition we want to allow for recovery in
case of having taken the wrong turn, and we want
to avoid looping, that is, walking in circles, with-
out ever getting closer to the goal. Last, but not
least we want to make sure that stored informa-
tion can also be accessed.
That this is less obvious than it might seem at
first sight has been shown by (Zock and Schwab,
2008). Taking two resources (WN and Wikipedia)
that contain both a given target word, we wanted
to see whether we could access it or not. The
target word was cvintagel. In order to find it we
provided two access keys, i.e. trigger words:
ewinel and °harvest&apos;. Combining the two produced
a list of 6 items in the case of WN and 45 in the
case of Wikipedia, yet, while the latter displayed
the target word, it was absent from the list pro-
duced by WN. This example illustrates the fact
that our claim concerning storage and acess is well
founded. Having stored something does by no
means guarantee its access.
In the next sections we will present a small ex-
periment concerning search.

(database or semantic network encoding associa-
tive relations between words) and an efficient
search algorithm to find the needed information,
in our case, words.
In other words, since search requires a map or a
resource in which to search and a good algorithm
to perform the search, we are keen in finding out
how different resources (for example, Wikipedia,
WordNet or JeuxdeMots) and various search al-
gorithms might affect efficiency of word access.
While there is a link between (the quality of) the
resource and the searching, we will separate the
two, focusing here mainly on the search algo-
rithms and possible ways to evaluate them.

4 Corpora and resources

<bodyText confidence="0.9995706">
Resources are built from corpora which can be of
various kinds: news, books, social media, ency-
clopedias, lexical databases,... They can be gen-
eral or specific, representing a particular domain.
’Text genre’ may of course have an impact on
what we can expect to retrieve. Obviously, one
will not take a database of stock exchange news
if one is looking for words referring to tennis- or
fishing equipment.
To build our resource, we relied on Word-
Net (WN).13 The resource can be seen in vari-
ous ways: as a semantic network, an association
13Note, that one may consider WN (Fellbaum, 1998) not
only as a dictionary, but also as a corpus. Actually we used
precisely this kind of corpus for building our resource.

matrix, or as a list or database of 4-tuples com-
posed of terms, links and weights. These ele-
ments can be represented in the following way,
&lt; X,Y,RZ,w&gt;, where X and Y are terms or ar-
guments of a given link, whose name expresses
the type of relationship holding between them
[RZ (synonyme, antonyme, hyperonyme, colloca-
tion,...)]. Links and terms have a certain weight w
which can be crucial for navigation and informa-
tion display (interface). Words may be grouped
into clusters,14 and the clusters as well as their el-
ements may be presented in the descending order
of the weight: frequent terms being shown on top
of the list.
Weights can be calculated in various ways: mu-
tual information, co-occurences, etc. For exam-
ple, for corpora, they can be seen as the number
of times two items co-occur in a given window
(sentence, phrase, paragraph, n words before or
after,...). Unfortunately, this kind of information
is not always available in current resources. For
example, WN relates terms (or senses), but does
not assign them any particular weight. Yet, this
information is very important and might be added
via some learning method.

5 Search Algorithms

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.925593">
5.1 Definitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989375">
Informally, a search algorithm is a method allow-
ing to retrieve a list of terms (candidate target
words presented in a given order) from a list of
pairs containing the cue- or trigger words and their
relations. For example figure 1 shows that the pair
(~beverage&apos;, ako) allows the retrieval of {°coffees
and °moccha#21}, two potential target words. More
formally, let’s define
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.930615">
f({(t1, R1), (t2, R2), ... ,(tm, Rm)}) (1)
= {(T1, w1), (T2, w2), ... (Tm, wm)}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997928">
where t1,t2,... ,tm are keys, cue- or trigger-words,
R1,R2,... ,Rm the type of relation, T1,T2,... ,Tm
candidate target-words and w1, w2,... ,wm, the as-
sociated weights. The curley brackets {} represent
the fact that we have an ordered set.
14All words having the same link will be stored and pre-
sented together. For example, ’cat’ and ’dog’ are likely to fall
in the category ’animal’, while ’hammer’ and ’screwdriver’
will fall in the category ’tools’.
Indeed, the ’trigger word-relation’ pairs are or-
dered, that is, they parallel the order in which
these terms were given as input at query time.
The candidate target words are ordered in terms of
confidence, ranking which may vary with respect
to a given search algorithm. In this paper, confi-
dence is based on the weights in the resource. Of
course, one could imagine other ways to define or
compute it.
Note that we can have R1 = R2, provided that
we do not have at the same time t1 = t2. For
instance, while it is possible to have {(°islands, in-
stance), (~island,, ako)}, one cannot have at the
same time {(°island,, instance), (°island,, instance)}
We present in the next sections various ways
to use the resource and various search algorithms.
In these experiments, we tried to use direct and
indirect links (mediated associations) contained in
the tuples and to establish linearly the weight as a
function of the position of the word in the list of
the trigger words.

5.2 General algorithm

that is, in the case of direct use, the search algo-
rithm fed with the trigger word t and the relation-
ship R found all target words T contained in the
tuple &lt; t,T,R,w&gt; of the resource Res. The com-
putation of the weight W is defined in 5.4. For
example, cmouse&apos;, would yield crodent&apos;, while crat&apos;,
would trigger canimal&apos; and crodent&apos;.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.643683">
5.3.2 Indirect use

Crossing the characteristics of weight (direct vs.
indirect) and use (direct vs. indirect), we get 4
possible search methods : direct use with basic
weighting (A1) or linear weighting (A2); and in-
direct use with basic weighting (A3) or linear

The classical in vivo / vitro approaches do not
seem to fit here. While the former tests the system
for a given application, the latter tests the system
independently. Given the fact that our system has
several components, we can evaluate each one of
them separately. More precisely, we can evaluate
the quality of the resource and/or the quality of
the search algorithm. We will focus here on the
search method.

6.2 Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967875">
The basic idea is to provide each algorithm with
an ordered set of trigger words and to see how
many of them are generally needed in order to re-
veal the target word.
Another way to evaluate the quality of the
search mechanism is to check at each step the po-
sition of the target word in the list generated by
the algorithms (output).

Psychologists have studied the differences of
monolingual and bilingual speakers experienc-
ing the ’tip-of-the-tongue’ problem (Pyers et al.,
2009). Their experiments were based on 52
pictures corresponding to low-frequency names.
Starting from this list we were looking for asso-
ciated words. In order to build this list we used as
resource the results produced by ’Deux de Mots’
(Lafourcade, 2007).16

6.3.1 JeuxdeMots (JdM)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885793650794">
JeuxdeMots, meaning in English ’word games’
or ’playing with words’, is an attempt to build
collaboratively, i.e. via a game, a lexical re-
source. The goal is to find out which words peo-
ple typically associate with each other and to build
then the corresponding resource, that is, a lexical-
semantic network. What counts as a typical as-
sociation is established empirically. Given some
input from the system –(term and link, let us say
’Americans’ and ’elect as president’)– the user
produces the associated word –(second term, let
us say ’Obama’),– answering this way the ques-
tion, what term x is related to y in this specific
way. Once the network is built, terms should be
accessible by entering the network at any point
(via some input) and by following the links un-
til one reaches the target word. This is at least the
theory. Unfortunately, in practice things do not
always work so well.
Actually, JdM has several flaws, especially with
respect to acces or search. The shortcomings are
probably rooted in too heavy reliance on the no-
tion of weight and in excessive filtering of the
output, i.e. premature elimination of the can-
didates presented to the user, list of elements
among which the user is meant to choose. In-
deed, JdM presents only the highest ranked candi-
date. Hence, words may never make it to the crit-
ical level to be included in the set from which the
user will choose the target word. Also, weights
do not necessarily correlate with users’ interests.
This problem can be solved in interactive search,
provided that the output contains a critical mass of
candidates (possibly organized according to some
point of view), but the problem is most likely re-
main if one presents only one candidate (the high-
est ranked term), as this latter is not necessarily
the target, neither is it always a term from which
one would like to continue search.
There is also a problem with the link names,
saurus (http://www.eat.rl.ac.uk/ ) as it contains
authentic word associations collected from people. This
point is well taken and we will consider this resource in the
future as its coverage is better than our current one and it also
avoids possible problems due to the translation. Though be-
ing generic, JeuxdeMots has mainly data on French, yet our
tests were run on English.
i.e. (metalanguage),17 though, to be fair, one must
admit that identifying and naming links is a very
difficult problem. Last, but not least, though more
related to the quality of the resource than to the
problem of search, there is a chance of user-bias.
Indeed, it is not entirely clear whether people re-
ally give the first association coming to their mind,
or the one fitting them best to continue the game
and win more points.
Despite these shortcomings, we will use JdM
as a resource as it exists not only for various lan-
guages, but is also quite rich, at least for French.
Unfortunately, the English version is very poor
compared to the French part.18 This is why we’ve
decided to use the French version for the test cor-
pus.

6.3.2 Building the test corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999763125">
Starting from Pyer’s list, we translated each
term into French and inspected then JDM in order
to find the 10 most frequently connected words ac-
cording to this resource. Next, we translated these
terms into English, producing the list shown in the
appendix.
As we will see later, in our experiment we do
not have typed relations between the words. Actu-
ally we took from JDM what they call ”associated
ideas”.
Nevertheless, when building the list we did
have some problems. Some words do not have
any, only one, or simply very few associated ideas.
This is particularly true for low frequency words.
This being so, we deleted them (in our case 7)
from the list.

’stop words’ (articles, conjunction, ...) we lem-
matize ’plain words’ by using DELA? 21

6.6 Comparison and evaluation of results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984228">
Due to time contraints, we decided to use only a
small sample of words, 10 to be precise. Con-
cerning search we have tested two parameters: the
scope (direct vs. indirect links, i.e. associations,
A1 vs. A3) and the weight (presence or absence,
A2 vs. A4).
The results are shown in table 1, where 0 means
that the algorithm did not find any solution, while
oo implies that the trigger word list has been fully
exhausted without being able to produce the target
word among the top ten candidates. Indeed, in
order to be considered as a hit, the found target
word has to be among the top ten.
As one can see our algorithms with indirect
use (A3 and A4) never manages to find the tar-
get word. Actually, it does not fail totally. It is
just that the candidate term appears very late in
the list, too late to be considered. The algorithms
with direct use (A1 and A2) do find the elusive
word or produce a ’list’ of zero candidates.

7 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982125">
We have started to caracterize lexical access as a
search problem. Since search requires a resource
in which to search and a good algorithm to per-
form the search, we were interested in establish-
ing how different resources –(Wikipedia (WiP),
WordNet (WN), JeuxdeMots (JdM))– and various
search algorithms might affect efficiency of word
access. The focus here has been on the latter.

<bodyText confidence="0.999916714285714">
Next to search algorithms, we presented some
methods for evaluating them. While our results
are clearly preliminary and on a very small scale,
we believe that the questions we have raised are
of the right sort. Of course, a lot more work is
needed in order to answer our questions with more
authority.

This kind of search often referred to as of the occurs not only in communication, but also in other activities of everyday life. Being basically a search problem it is likely to occur whenever we look for something that exists in real world (objects) or our mind: dates, phone numbers, past events, peoples’ names, or you just name it. As one can see, we are concerned here with the problem of words, or rather, how to find them in the place where they are stored: the human brain, or an external resource, a dictionary. Our work being confined to lexical access, we would like develp a map a help language producers to find the word they are looking for. More precisely, we try to build an index and a navigational tool allowing people to access words no matter how incomplete their conceptual input may be. Our approach is based on psyfindings concerning the lexicon 2003; Levelt et al., 1999), i.e. information in the human mind, obstrategies typical 2 Consider the following elements before attempting an engineering solution Before conceiving a roadmap leading to an engineering solution it may be useful to consider certain points. The list here below is by no means complete, neither is the following discussion. Nevertheless we believe that the following points are worth consideration: features of the mental lexicon, how to build and use the resource, searching, ranking and weights, interface problems. For reasons of space constraints we will touch briefly only upon some of these points. Our main goal is the enhancement of electronic dictionaries to help speakers or writers to find 75 of the 2nd Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex pages Beijing, August 2010 quickly and intuitively the word they are looking. To achieve this target we take inspiration in the findings concerning the human brain (structure, process) when it tries access words in the mental lexicon. The a and concepts, definitions) are stored side by side in paper dictionaries (holistic presentation), the human brain stores them differently. The information concerning meaning, forms and sound is distributed across various layers. Lexical fragmentation or information distribution is supported by empirical and while this fact is arguably the reason accounting for word access problems, it is probably also the explanation of the power and the flexibility of the human mind which generally manages to find in no time the right term after having searched for it in a huge store of words. While it is still not entirely clear what is stored, whether anything is stored at all 2coming close to the kind of information generally found in dictionaries, it does seem clear though that the structure of mental lexicon is a multidimensional network in which the user navigates. ”Entries in the lexicon are not islands; the lexicon has an internal structure. Items are connected or related in ways...There are item relations (Levelt, 1989). While the forrelate syntactic (part of speech), morphological, phonological informathe latter connect lexical In sum, errors 1980), studies on al., 1997; Blanken et al., 2004) or times studies et al., 1999), et al., 2007; Kikyo et al., 2001), 2004), experiments on et 1976) or the of the tongue problem (Brown and McNeill, 1996). important feature of the mental lexicon lies in the that the entries are not (Marslen- Wilson, 1990; Altmann, 1997). Of course, such a detail can have far reaching consequences concerning knowledge representation and use, i.e. structure and process. are typically the kind of relations we can find in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), which happens to be quite rich in this respect, but relatively poor with regard to intrinsic, i.e. intralexical information. lexical networks store or encode the information people typically have with regard to words, and finding the needed information, amounts to enter the graph at some point,– in the case of writing or speaking, usually a node dedicated to meaning,– and to follow the links until one has reached the goal (target word). While computer scientists call this kind of search ’navigation’, psychologists prefer the term ’activation spreading. While not being exactly the same, functionally speaking they are equivalent though. As every day language experience shows, things may go wrong, we lack information, hence we get blocked. Yet when trying to complete the puzzle we do not start from scratch, we rely on existing information, which, in terms of the network metaphor means that we start from (information underlying) a word being close to the tar- It is interesting to note, that our lexical graphs to have similar characteristics as small- These latter are a type of graph in which most nodes, eventhough not being direct neighbors, can be reached via a small number of clicks, about 6, regardless of the starting point. This property of networks, where objects, or the nodes standing for them, are highly connected has first been described by Frigyes Karinthy (1929) a Hungarian writer, to be tested then many years later by a social psychologist (Milgram, 1961). Nodes can be anything, people, words, etc. If they represent people, than edges specify their relationship, i.e. the very fact that they know each other, that they are friends, etc. Given this high connectivity, anything seems to be at the distance of a few mouse clicks. Hence, it is easy to connect people or to find out who entertains with whom what kind of relationship. Obviously, there is a striking similarity to our lexical graphs, and the smallworld feature has been tested by mathematicians, who concluded that the distance for words is even smaller than in the original Milgram experiments, namely 4 rather than 6. Indeed, (Motter et al., 2002) and colleagues could show that more than TOT experiments have shown (Brown and McNeill, 1996), people always know something concerning the target word (meaning, form, relation to other words), hence finding a word in such a situation amounts to puzzle-completion. 76 99 percent of the word pairs of their corpus could be connected in 4 steps at the most. 2.2 Building the resource There are two elements we need to get a clearer of: the nature of the and the method the way to explore it. Concerning the resource, there are many possible sources (dictionary, thesaurus, corpora, or a mix of all this) and many ways of building it. Since our main goal is the building of an index based on the notion of word relations (triples composed of two terms and a link), the prime candidates are of course lists the ones collected by psychologists. While the former are raw data, containing the information in a more or less hidden form, the latter (often) contain the data explicitely, but they are scarce, subject to change, and some of links are Concerning the resource the followpoints deserve consideration: representa- Size or While size or coverage are critical variables, they should not be overemphasized though, trading quantity against quality. We need to define the meaning of quality here, and whether, when or how lack of quality can be (partially) compensated by quantity. In other words, we need to define thresholds. In the absence of clear guidelines it is probably wise to strive for a good balance between the two, which again assumes that we know what quality means. • Obviously, the system we have in mind is only as good as the data we use, i.e. the purity/accuracy and representativity of the word/feature-association lists. flaw is due to the experimental protocol. Subjects are asked to give the first word coming to their mind right after a stimulas. Not having been asked to specify the link it is the experimenter who does so. Yet, many word pairs,– say, cat and dog,– allow for various links (love, tease, chase, etc.), and it is not obvious at all which is the one intended by the user. This problem could have been avoided to a large extent the instruction had been, ”build a the following word”. Another potential problem may be due to the distance between the source and the target word: the link may be mediated. No single set of data (dictionary, corpus, thesaurus) will ever suffice to capture the knowledge people have. While it would be unrealistic to try to model the semantic map of everyone, it is not unreasonable to try to reach an average user, say someone who has been to school and is a computer literate. If we want to capture the world-knowledge of this kind of user (target), than we must beware that it is contained in the material we use, since our resource will be based on this data. Hence, taking as corpus only the newspapers by an elite (say, in France), will surely not suffice to capture the information we need, as it will not relate information ordinary citizens, say sport fans, are familiar with or interested in. In sum, we need to take a wide variety of sources to extract then the needed information. While there is shortage of some document types needed, there are nevertheless quite a few sources one may consider to begin with: Wikipedia, domain taxonomies, topic signatures, (Lin and Hovy, 2000), a database like (http://openrdf.org), etc. • Topic sensitivity Weights are important, but they tend to change dynamically with time and the topic. Think of the word ’piano’ uttered in the contexts of a ’concert’ or ’household moving’. It is only in this latter case that this term evokes like The dynamic recompution of weights as a function of topic changes requires that the system be able to recognize the topic changes, as otherwise it might mislead the user by providing of inadequate weights. For some initial work see (Ferret and Zock, 2006). Psychologists have built such lists already decades ago (Deese, 1965; Schvaneveldt, 1989). Similar lists are nowadays freely available on the web. For example, for English is the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus and the compilation done by Nelson and his colin Florida There are also some re- 77 for German (see 8or for and probably many other languages. While association lists are generally built manually, one can also try to do so automatically or with the help of people (see section 5 in (Zock and Bilac, 2004)). JeuxdeMot (JdM), a collectively built resource focusing on French being an in 2.3 Searching The goal of searching is more complex than one might think. Of course, ultimately one should find object one is looking but the very process should also be carried out quickly and naturally. In addition we want to allow for recovery in case of having taken the wrong turn, and we want to avoid looping, that is, walking in circles, without ever getting closer to the goal. Last, but not least we want to make sure that stored information can also be accessed. That this is less obvious than it might seem at first sight has been shown by (Zock and Schwab, 2008). Taking two resources (WN and Wikipedia) that contain both a given target word, we wanted to see whether we could access it or not. The word was In order to find it we provided two access keys, i.e. trigger words: Combining the two produced a list of 6 items in the case of WN and 45 in the case of Wikipedia, yet, while the latter displayed the target word, it was absent from the list produced by WN. This example illustrates the fact that our claim concerning storage and acess is well founded. Having stored something does by no means guarantee its access. In the next sections we will present a small experiment concerning search. 3 System architecture To allow for word access, we need at least two components: an index, i.e. a resource, representing or encoding the way words are connected terry/jwad.html poses special requirements concerning the organization, indexing and ranking of the data, i.e. words. We will not get into these issues here. (database or semantic network encoding associative relations between words) and an efficient search algorithm to find the needed information, in our case, words. In other words, since search requires a map or a resource in which to search and a good algorithm to perform the search, we are keen in finding out how different resources (for example, Wikipedia, WordNet or JeuxdeMots) and various search algorithms might affect efficiency of word access. While there is a link between (the quality of) the resource and the searching, we will separate the two, focusing here mainly on the search algorithms and possible ways to evaluate them. ako&apos;( Constwfion Resource � -0,V,R,w&gt; �� system 1: architecture of the system: the matrix) and a set of algorithms 4 Corpora and resources Resources are built from corpora which can be of various kinds: news, books, social media, encyclopedias, lexical databases,... They can be general or specific, representing a particular domain. ’Text genre’ may of course have an impact on what we can expect to retrieve. Obviously, one will not take a database of stock exchange news if one is looking for words referring to tennisor fishing equipment. To build our resource, we relied on Word- The resource can be seen in various ways: as a semantic network, an association that one may consider WN (Fellbaum, 1998) not only as a dictionary, but also as a corpus. Actually we used precisely this kind of corpus for building our resource. ������ � ������ ��������� ���� !������������� ��&amp;quot;���� ��������� ������ �������� Search algorkhm 78 matrix, or as a list or database of 4-tuples composed of terms, links and weights. These elements can be represented in the following way, where terms or arguments of a given link, whose name expresses the type of relationship holding between them antonyme, hyperonyme, colloca- Links and terms have a certain weight which can be crucial for navigation and information display (interface). Words may be grouped and the clusters as well as their elements may be presented in the descending order of the weight: frequent terms being shown on top of the list. Weights can be calculated in various ways: mutual information, co-occurences, etc. For example, for corpora, they can be seen as the number of times two items co-occur in a given window (sentence, phrase, paragraph, n words before or after,...). Unfortunately, this kind of information is not always available in current resources. For example, WN relates terms (or senses), but does not assign them any particular weight. Yet, this information is very important and might be added via some learning method. 5 Search Algorithms 5.1 Definitions Informally, a search algorithm is a method allowing to retrieve a list of terms (candidate target words presented in a given order) from a list of pairs containing the cueor trigger words and their relations. For example figure 1 shows that the pair allows the retrieval of two potential target words. More formally, let’s define ... ... are keys, cueor the of the as- The curley brackets the fact that we have an ordered set. words having the same link will be stored and presented together. For example, ’cat’ and ’dog’ are likely to fall in the category ’animal’, while ’hammer’ and ’screwdriver’ will fall in the category ’tools’. Indeed, the ’trigger word-relation’ pairs are ordered, that is, they parallel the order in which these terms were given as input at query time. The candidate target words are ordered in terms of confidence, ranking which may vary with respect to a given search algorithm. In this paper, confidence is based on the weights in the resource. Of course, one could imagine other ways to define or compute it. that we can have provided that do not have at the same time For while it is possible to have inone cannot have at the time instance), We present in the next sections various ways to use the resource and various search algorithms. these experiments, we tried to use links associations) contained in the tuples and to establish linearly the weight as a function of the position of the word in the list of the trigger words. 5.2 General algorithm In the general algorithm, we consider that our canwords at the intersection of the corresponding to the pairs of words their = ∩ will now show, step by step, how is affected by various uses (direct vs. indirect use) and orderings. This will yield 4 kinds of search algorithms. 5.3.1 Direct use In this case, we rely only on the direct links the resource = (3) 5.3 The use of the tuples To illustrate our algorithms, let us consider the following resource: 79 that is, in the case of direct use, the search algofed with the trigger word the relationall target words in the the resource The comof the weight defined in 5.4.

Following this line of reasoning, we may consider the following cases: ... , 1) note, we consider here only one intermediate word (two links), as this is, computationally speaking, already quite expensive. In our example of direct use, if our trigger word is W will be 7 + 1 W = 10 for indirect use, W is 4 + 1 for + 4) + 1 + for 5.5 Proposed Search Algorithms the characteristics of vs. and vs. indirect), we get 4 methods direct use with (A1) or (A2); and inwith (A3) or weighting (A4). 6 Evaluation 6.1 The problem of evaluation. classical vivo / vitro do not seem to fit here. While the former tests the system for a given application, the latter tests the system independently. Given the fact that our system has several components, we can evaluate each one of them separately. More precisely, we can evaluate quality of the the quality of We will focus here on the search method. 6.2 Procedure The basic idea is to provide each algorithm with ordered set of words to see how many of them are generally needed in order to rethe Another way to evaluate the quality of the mechanism is to check at each step the pothe target word in the list generated by the algorithms (output). 6.3 Building the test corpus Psychologists have studied the differences of monolingual and bilingual speakers experiencing the ’tip-of-the-tongue’ problem (Pyers et al., 2009). Their experiments were based on 52 pictures corresponding to low-frequency names. Starting from this list we were looking for associated words. In order to build this list we used as resource the results produced by ’Deux de Mots’ mentionned by one of the reviewers, we could and should have used the Edinburgh Associative The- 80 6.3.1 JeuxdeMots (JdM) JeuxdeMots, meaning in English ’word games’ or ’playing with words’, is an attempt to build collaboratively, i.e. via a game, a lexical resource. The goal is to find out which words people typically associate with each other and to build then the corresponding resource, that is, a lexicalnetwork. What counts as a asestablished empirically. Given some input from the system –(term and link, let us say ’Americans’ and ’elect as president’)– the user produces the associated word –(second term, let us say ’Obama’),– answering this way the question, what term x is related to y in this specific way. Once the network is built, terms should be accessible by entering the network at any point (via some input) and by following the links until one reaches the target word. This is at least the theory. Unfortunately, in practice things do not always work so well. Actually, JdM has several flaws, especially with respect to acces or search. The shortcomings are probably rooted in too heavy reliance on the notion of weight and in excessive filtering of the output, i.e. premature elimination of the candidates presented to the user, list of elements among which the user is meant to choose. Indeed, JdM presents only the highest ranked candidate. Hence, words may never make it to the critical level to be included in the set from which the user will choose the target word. Also, weights do not necessarily correlate with users’ interests. This problem can be solved in interactive search, provided that the output contains a critical mass of candidates (possibly organized according to some point of view), but the problem is most likely remain if one presents only one candidate (the highest ranked term), as this latter is not necessarily the target, neither is it always a term from which one would like to continue search. is also a problem with the as it contains authentic word associations collected from people. This point is well taken and we will consider this resource in the future as its coverage is better than our current one and it also avoids possible problems due to the translation. Though being generic, JeuxdeMots has mainly data on French, yet our tests were run on English. though, to be fair, one must admit that identifying and naming links is a very difficult problem. Last, but not least, though more related to the quality of the resource than to the problem of search, there is a chance of user-bias. Indeed, it is not entirely clear whether people really give the first association coming to their mind, or the one fitting them best to continue the game and win more points. Despite these shortcomings, we will use JdM as a resource as it exists not only for various languages, but is also quite rich, at least for French. Unfortunately, the English version is very poor to the French This is why we’ve decided to use the French version for the test corpus. 6.3.2 Building the test corpus Starting from Pyer’s list, we translated each term into French and inspected then JDM in order to find the 10 most frequently connected words according to this resource. Next, we translated these terms into English, producing the list shown in the appendix. As we will see later, in our experiment we do have relations the words. Actually we took from JDM what they call ”associated ideas”. Nevertheless, when building the list we did have some problems. Some words do not have any, only one, or simply very few associated ideas. This is particularly true for low frequency words. This being so, we deleted them (in our case 7) from the list. 6.4 Description of the tool Our tool is implemented in Java. To allow for onaccess 19we use Google’s Web The interface is very simple, akin to Google’s search engine. At the top of the page the user is to provide the input, i.e. the term association underspecified to say the least. example, while for English JdM has by today (july 9, 2010) only 654 relations, the French part contained 1.011.632 the very same day, and 994.889 a month ago. schwab 81 checkbox allows to choose at the are shown the candidate 6.5 Description of the resource for the experiment In this experiment, we use the English version of Wikipedia to build our resource. Due to corpus only one relation is used: We consider ”words occuring in the same paragraph” as neighbours. After having deleted ’stop words’ (articles, conjunction, ...) we lem- ’plain words’ by using DELA? For example, a corpus containing the followtwo sentences ”The cat eats the mouse mouse eats some cheese” would yield the following resource : It should be noted that in this experiment, links are symmetrical. 6.6 Comparison and evaluation of results Due to time contraints, we decided to use only a small sample of words, 10 to be precise. Concerning search we have tested two parameters: the vs. indirect links, i.e. associations, vs. A3) and the or absence, A2 vs. A4). results are shown in table 1, where that the algorithm did not find any solution, while that the trigger word list has been fully exhausted without being able to produce the target word among the top ten candidates. Indeed, in order to be considered as a hit, the found target word has to be among the top ten. As one can see our algorithms with indirect use (A3 and A4) never manages to find the target word. Actually, it does not fail totally. It is just that the candidate term appears very late in the list, too late to be considered. The algorithms with direct use (A1 and A2) do find the elusive word or produce a ’list’ of zero candidates.

Since search requires a resource in which to search and a good algorithm to perform the search, we were interested in establishhow different (WiP), WordNet (WN), JeuxdeMots (JdM))– and various algorithms affect efficiency of word access. The focus here has been on the latter. 82 Next to search algorithms, we presented some methods for evaluating them. While our results are clearly preliminary and on a very small scale, we believe that the questions we have raised are of the right sort. Of course, a lot more work is needed in order to answer our questions with more authority. 8 Appendix bee; honey; queen; cell; royal jelly; wax; group; frame; nest; bird; feather; animal; spread; shout; blue; tail; disdainful; arrogant; despise; star; space; shooting star; astronomy; sky; galaxy; night; universe; apparition; small; observe; enlarging; microscopic; observation; ocular; optical; twin; eyeglass;glasses; sea; diving; breath; ocean; mask; flipper; jug; jar; carafe; dishes; vase; ewer; container; cut; kill; split; fell; murder; saw; agriculture; arboriculture; pavilion; platform; viewpoint; terrace;view; architecture; house; pavillon; esplanade farming; tool; shovel; pick; technique;spade; tower; king; dungeon; fort; queen; drawbridge; prince; princess; embrasure; moon; sun; astronomie; disappearance; darkness; door; lock; padlock; key; close; button; metal; box; house; portal; bolt; sound; loudspeaker; fish; sea; wing; wheel; carry; garden; shovel; gardener; fill; push; bomb; explosion; explosive; weapon;wick; chemistry; plastic; direction; navigation; navy; windrose; cut; scissor; prune; pair; hairdresser; paper; school; chisel; egg; bird; Australia; cassowary; emu; woodwork; tool; poverty; polished; dishes; blind; alphabet; writing; dig; drill; pierce; scaffold; widow; death penalty; head; reaper; decapitation; execution; torture; rooster; direction; wind; rooftop; rotation; east; south; north; west; container; oil; milk; bottle; container; cuve; jerrycan; tank; fun fair; amusement park; children; entertainment; meal; school; eat; dessert; dish; tableland; entrance; restaurant; food; refectory; supervisor; glass; wood; tail; tooth; trapper; trunk; sight; glasses; myopia; eyes; rim; twin-lens; optician; sun; vision; see; rectification; improvement; astigmatic; ophthalmologist; farsighted; longsighted; blind; binoculars; nose; optical; pair; telescope; protection; Australia; object; flying; throw; come back; painting; drawing; support; tripod; boat; ship; plane; propulsion; curve; rotation; rolling; fruit; hazelnut; almond; tree; cashew; nutcracker; oil; salad; woodwork; ejection; old weapon; throw; stone; aircraft carrier; crossbow; ballista; sling; milk; cow; chest; nipple tit; direction; rotation; instruments; gyrostat; pharaoh; Egypt; pyramid; strip; dead; embalm; sarcophagus; fruits; funeral; junction; woodwork; middle; locksmiths; assemblage; music; instrument; breath; flute; musical instruments; musical, tempo, musical instruments; hang; boat; attach; bind; cord; musical instruments; zither; lute; lyre; psaltery; weapon; attack; projectile weapon; catapult; Paris; steel; monument; metal; drug; injection; sting; nurse; sick; ill; bodycare; drug addiction; Words containing too little information to usable for tests unicycle, thermos, 83 antlers, plunger, cleftchin, handcuffs.</abstract>

Hence, it is easy to connect people or to find out who entertains with whom what kind of relationship. Obviously, there is a striking similarity to our lexical graphs, and the smallworld feature has been tested by mathematicians, who concluded that the distance for words is even smaller than in the original Milgram experiments, namely 4 rather than 6. Indeed, (Motter et al., 2002) and colleagues could show that more than 4As TOT experiments have shown (Brown and McNeill, 1996), people always know something concerning the target word (meaning, form, relation to other words), hence finding a word in such a situation amounts to puzzle-completion. 76 99 percent of the word pairs of their corpus could be connected in 4 steps at the most. 2.2 Building the resource There are two elements we need to get a clearer picture of: the nature of the resource (semantic map), and the search method i.e. the way to explore it. Concerning the resource, there are many possible sources (dictionary, thesaurus, corpora, or a mix of all this) and many ways of building it. Since our main go</context>

Their experiments were based on 52 pictures corresponding to low-frequency names. Starting from this list we were looking for associated words.

Hence, taking as corpus only the newspapers read by an elite (say, Le Monde, in France), will surely not suffice to capture the information we need, as it will not relate information ordinary citizens, say sport fans, are familiar with or interested in. In sum, we need to take a wide variety of sources to extract then the needed information. While there is shortage of some document types needed, there are nevertheless quite a few sources one may consider to begin with: Wikipedia, domain taxonomies, topic signatures, (Lin and Hovy, 2000), a database like (http://openrdf.org), etc. • Topic sensitivity Weights are important, but they tend to change dynamically with time and the topic. Think of the word ’piano’ uttered in the contexts of a ’concert’ or ’household moving’. It is only in this latter case that this term evokes ideas like size or weight. The dynamic recompution of weights as a function of topic changes requires that the system be able to recognize the topic changes, as otherwise it might mislead the user by providing of inadequate weights.

These latter are a type of graph in which most nodes, eventhough not being direct neighbors, can be reached via a small number of clicks, about 6, regardless of the starting point. This property of networks, where objects, or the nodes standing for them, are highly connected has first been described by Frigyes Karinthy (1929) a Hungarian writer, to be tested then many years later by a social psychologist (Milgram, 1961). Nodes can be anything, people, words, etc. If they represent people, than edges specify their relationship, i.e. the very fact that they know each other, that they are friends, etc. Given this high connectivity, anything seems to be at the distance of a few mouse clicks. Hence, it is easy to connect people or to find out who entertains with whom what kind of relationship. Obviously, there is a striking similarity to our lexical graphs, and the smallworld feature has been tested by mathematicians, who concluded that the distance for words is even smaller than in the original Milgram experimen</context>

We will focus here on the search method. 6.2 Procedure The basic idea is to provide each algorithm with an ordered set of trigger words and to see how many of them are generally needed in order to reveal the target word. Another way to evaluate the quality of the search mechanism is to check at each step the position of the target word in the list generated by the algorithms (output). 6.3 Building the test corpus Psychologists have studied the differences of monolingual and bilingual speakers experiencing the ’tip-of-the-tongue’ problem (Pyers et al., 2009). Their experiments were based on 52 pictures corresponding to low-frequency names. Starting from this list we were looking for associated words. In order to build this list we used as resource the results produced by ’Deux de Mots’ (Lafourcade, 2007).16 16As mentionned by one of the reviewers, we could and probably should have used the Edinburgh Associative The80 6.3.1 JeuxdeMots (JdM) JeuxdeMots, meaning in English ’word games’ or ’playing with words’, is an attempt to build collaboratively, i.e. via a game, a lexical resource.

Last, but not least we want to make sure that stored information can also be accessed. That this is less obvious than it might seem at first sight has been shown by (Zock and Schwab, 2008). Taking two resources (WN and Wikipedia) that contain both a given target word, we wanted to see whether we could access it or not. The target word was cvintagel. In order to find it we provided two access keys, i.e. trigger words: ewinel and °harvest&apos;. Combining the two produced a list of 6 items in the case of WN and 45 in the case of Wikipedia, yet, while the latter displayed the target word, it was absent from the list produced by WN. This example illustrates the fact that our claim concerning storage and acess is well founded. Having stored something does by no means guarantee its access</context>
