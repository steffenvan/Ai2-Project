Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999590625">
The temporal relations that hold between events de-
scribed by successive utterances are often left implicit
or underspecified. We address the role of two phenom-
ena with respect to the recovery of these relations: (1)
the referential properties of tense, and (2) the role of
temporal constraints imposed by coherence relations.
We account for several facets of the identification of
temporal relations through an integration of these.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.970389157894737">
Tense interpretation has received much attention in lin-
guistics (Partee, 1984; Hinrichs, 1986; Nerbonne, 1986,
inter alia) and natural language processing (Webber,
1988; Kameyama et al., 1993; Lascarides and Asher,
1993, inter alia). Several researchers (Partee, 1984;
Hinrichs, 1986; Nerbonne, 1986; Webber, 1988) have
sought to explain the temporal relations induced by
tense by treating it as anaphoric, drawing on Reichen-
bach&apos;s separation between event, speech, and reference
times (Reichenbach, 1947). Specifically, to account for
the forward progression of time induced by successive
simple past tenses in a narrative, they treat the simple
past as referring to a time evoked by a previous past
tense. For instance, in Hinrichs&apos;s (1986) proposal, ac-
complishments and achievements&apos; introduce a new ref-
erence point that is temporally ordered after the time
of the event itself, &amp;quot;ensuring that two consecutive ac-
complishments or achievements in a discourse are al-
ways ordered in a temporal sequence.&amp;quot; On the other
hand, Lascarides and Asher (1993) take the view that
temporal relations are resolved purely as a by-product
of reasoning about coherence relations holding between
utterances, and in doing so, argue that treating sim-
ple and complex tenses as anaphoric is unnecessary.
This approach parallels the treatment of pronoun res-
olution espoused by Hobbs (1979), in which pronouns
are modeled as free variables that are bound as a by-
product of coherence resolution. The Temporal Cen-
tering framework (Kameyama et al., 1993) integrates

aspects of both approaches, but patterns with the first
in treating tense as anaphoric.
We argue that aspects of both analyses are necessary
to account for the recovery of temporal relations. To
demonstrate our approach we will address the following
examples; passages (la-b) are taken from Lascarides
and Asher (1993):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9814402">
(1) a. Max slipped. He spilt a bucket of water.
b. Max slipped. He had spilt a bucket of water.
c. Max slipped because he spilt a bucket of water.
d. Max slipped because he had spilt a bucket of
water.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998584875">
Passage (la) is understood as a narrative, indicating
that the spilling was subsequent to the slipping. Pas-
sages (lb-d) are instead understood as the second clause
explaining the first, indicating that the reverse temporal
ordering holds. We address two related questions; the
first arises from treating the simple past as anaphoric.
Specifically, if a treatment such as Hinrichs&apos;s is used
to explain the forward progression of time in example
(la), then it must be explained why sentence (lc) is as
felicitous as sentence (1d). That is, one would predict a
clash of temporal relations for sentence (lc), since the
simple pasts induce the forward progression of time but
the conjunction indicates the reverse temporal ordering.
The second question arises from assuming that all tem-
poral relations are recovered solely from reasoning with
coherence relations. Specifically, because the use of the
simple past in passage (lc) is as felicitous as the past
perfect in passage (1d) under the explanation interpre-
tation (in these cases indicated explicitly by because),
then it must be explained why passage (la) is not un-
derstood as an explanation as is passage (lb), where
in each case the relationship needs to be inferred. We
present our analysis in the next section, and account
for these facts in Section 3.

The Account

<bodyText confidence="0.9999735">
We postulate rules characterizing the referential nature
of tense and the role of discourse relations in further
constraining the temporal relations between clauses.
The rules governing tense are:

<listItem confidence="0.950847833333333">
1. Main verb tenses are indefinitely referential, cre-
ating a new temporal entity under constraints
imposed by its type (i.e., past, present, or fu-
ture) in relation to a discourse reference time2 tR.
For instance, a main verb past tense introduces a
new temporal entity t under the constraint prior-
to(t,tR). For simple tenses tR is the speech time,
and therefore simple tenses are not anaphoric.
2. Tensed auxiliaries in complex tenses are anaphor-
ic, identifying tR as a previously existing tempo-
ral entity. The indefinite main verb tense is then
ordered with respect to this i.e.

The tenses used may not completely specify the implicit
temporal relations between the described events. We
claim that these relations may be further refined by
constraints imposed by the coherence relation operative
between clauses. We describe three coherence relations
relevant to the examples in this paper and give temporal
constraints for them.3
Narration: The Narration relation is characterized by
a series of events displaying forward movement of
time, such as in passage (la). As did Lascarides
and Asher (1993), we capture this ordering as a
constraint imposed by the Narration coherence re-
lation itself:4

<listItem confidence="0.626458">
(2) If Narration(A,B) then tA &lt; JR
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997737538461539">
Parallel: The Parallel relation relates utterances that
share a common topic. This relation does not
impose constraints on the temporal relations be-
tween the events beyond those provided by the
tenses themselves. For instance, if passage (la)
was uttered in response to the question What bad
things happened to Max today? (inducing a Paral-
lel relation instead of Narration), a temporal or-
dering among the sentences is no longer implied.
Explanation: The Explanation relation denotes a
cause-effect relationship with reversed clause or-
dering, as in sentences (lb-d). Therefore, the sec-
ond event is constrained to preceding the first:

To summarize the analysis, we claim that tense oper-
ates as indefinite reference with respect to a possibly
anaphorically-resolved discourse reference time. The
temporal relations specified may be further refined as

3We assume here that the two clauses in question are
related directly by a coherence relation. This may not be
the case; for instance the use of a past perfect may signal
the start of an embedded discourse segment, as in Web-
ber&apos;s flower shop example (Webber, 1988; Kameyama et al.,
1993). How this account is to be extended to address coher-
ence at the discourse segment level is the subject of future
work.

constraint.

Examples

<bodyText confidence="0.999791411764706">
We now analyze the examples presented in Section 1,
repeated below, using this approach:
Max slipped. He spilt a bucket of water.
Max slipped. He had spilt a bucket of water.
Max slipped because he spilt a bucket of water.
Max slipped because he had spilt a bucket of
water.
The implicit ordering on the times indefinitely evoked
by the simple pasts in passage (4a) results solely from
understanding it as a Narration. In passage (4b), the
auxiliary had refers to the event time of the slipping,
and thus the past tense on spill creates a temporal en-
tity constrained to precede that time. This necessitates
a coherence relation that is consistent with this tem-
poral order, in this case, Explanation. In passage (4c),
the times evoked by the simple pasts are further or-
dered by the Explanation relation indicated by because,
resulting in the backward progression of time. In pas-
sage (4d), both the tense and the coherence relation
order the times in backward progression.
Restating the first problem noted in Section 1, if
treating the simple past as anaphoric is used to account
for the forward progression of time in passage (4a), then
one would expect the existence of the Explanation re-
lation in passage (4c) to cause a temporal clash, where
in fact passage (4c) is perfectly felicitous. No clash of
temporal relations is predicted by our account, because
the use of the simple pasts do not in themselves imply
a specific ordering between them. The Narration rela-
tion orders the times in forward progression in passage
(4a) and the Explanation relation orders them in back-
ward progression in passage (4c). The Parallel relation
would specify no ordering (see the potential context for
passage (4a) given in Section 2).
Restating the second problem noted in Section 1, if
temporal relations can be recovered solely from reason-
ing with coherence relations, and the use of the simple
past in passage (4c) is as felicitous as the past perfect
in passage (4d) under the Explanation interpretation,
then one asks why passage (4a) is not understood as an
Explanation as is passage (4b), where in each case the
relationship needs to be inferred. We hypothesize that
hearers assume that speakers are engaging in Narration
in absence of a specific cue to the contrary. The use
of the past perfect (as in passage (4b)) is one such cue
since it implies reversed temporal ordering; the use of
an explicit conjunction indicating a coherence relation
other than Narration (as in passages (4c-d)) is another
such cue. While passage (4a) could be understood as an
Explanation on semantic grounds, the hearer assumes
Narration since no other relation is cued.

We see several advantages of this approach over that
of Lascarides and Asher (1993, henceforth L&amp;A). First,
L&amp;A note the incoherence of example (5)
(5) ? Max poured a cup of coffee. He had entered the
room.
in arguing that the past perfect should not be treated
as anaphoric:
(6) Theories that analyse the distinction between the
simple past and pluperfect purely in terms of dif-
ferent relations between reference times and event
times, rather than in terms of event-connections,
fail to explain why [(4b)] is acceptable but [(5)] is
awkward. (Lascarides and Asher, 1993, pg. 470)
Example (5) indeed shows that coherence relations need
to be utilized to account for temporal relations, but it
does not bear on the issue of whether the past per-
fect is anaphoric. The incoherence of example (5) is
predicted by both their and our accounts by virtue of
the fact that there is no coherence relation that corre-
sponds to Narration with reverse temporal ordering.5
In addressing this example, L&amp;A specify a special rule
(the Connections When Changing Tense (CCT) Law)
that stipulates that a sentence containing the simple
past followed by a sentence containing the past perfect
can be related only by a subset of the otherwise possi-
ble coherence relations. However, this subset contains
just those relations that are predicted to be possible by
accounts treating the past perfect as anaphoric; they
are the ones that do not constrain the temporal order
of the events against displaying backward progression
of time. Therefore, we see no advantages to adopting
their rule; furthermore, they do not comment on what
other laws have to be stipulated to account for the facts
concerning other possible tense combinations.
Second, to explain why the Explanation relation can
be inferred for passage (4b) but not for passage (4a),
L&amp;A stipulate that their causal Slipping Law (stating
that spilling can cause slipping) requires that the CCT
Law be satisfied. This constraint is imposed only to
require that the second clause contain the past per-
fect instead of the simple past. However, this does not
explain why the use of the simple past is perfectly co-
herent when the Explanation relationship is indicated
overtly as it is in sentence (4c), nor do they adequately
explain why CCT must be satisfied for this causal law
and not for those supporting similar examples for which
they successfully infer an unsignaled Explanation rela-
tion (see discussion of example (2), pg. 463).
Third, the L&amp;A account does not explain why the
past perfect cannot stand alone nor discourses gener-
ally be opened with it; consider stating sentence (7) in
isolation:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.473586">
(7) Max had spilt a bucket of water.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.946249461538461">
&apos;For instance, in the same way that Explanation corre-
sponds to Cause-Effect with reverse temporal ordering.
Intuitively, such usage is infelicitous because of a depen-
dency on a contextually salient time which has not been
previously introduced. This is not captured by the L&amp;A
account because sentences containing the past perfect
are treated as sententially equivalent to those contain-
ing the simple past. On the other hand, sentences in the
simple past are perfectly felicitous in standing alone or
opening a discourse, introducing an asymmetry in ac-
counts treating the simple past as anaphoric to a pre-
viously evoked time. All of these facts are explained by
the account given here.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989222285714286">
We have given an account of temporal relations whereby
(1) tense is resolved indefinitely with respect to a possi-
bly anaphorically-resolved discourse reference time, and
(2) the resultant temporal relations may be further re-
fined by constraints that coherence relations impose.
This work is being expanded to address issues pertain-
ing to discourse structure and inter-segment coherence.
