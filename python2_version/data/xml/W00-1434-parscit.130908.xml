1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999559607142857">
This paper describes the RSTTool, a graphical in-
terface for marking up the structure of text. While
primarily intended to be used for marking up Rhet-
orical Structure (cf. Rhetorical Structure Theory
(RST): Mann and Thompson (1988)), the tool also
allows the mark-up of constituency-style analysis, as
in Hasan&apos;s Generic Structure Potential (GSP - cf.
Hasan (1996)).
The tool is written in the platform-independent
scripting language, Tcl/Tk, and thus works under
Windows, Macintosh, UNIX and LINUX operating
systems.
RSTTool is easy to use, one creates an RST dia-
gram from a text by dragging from segment to seg-
ment, indicating rhetorical dependency. There is a
separate interface for text segmentation. The tool
can automatically segment at sentence boundaries
(with reasonable accuracy), and the user clicks on
the text to add boundaries missed by the automatic
segmenter (or click on superfluous boundaries to re-
move them).
The tool was previously described in O&apos;Donnell
(1997). However, since then the tool has been sub-
stantially revised and extended,(the current version
being 2.4). This version is also far more robust due
to extensive debugging by one of RST&apos;s inventor&apos;s,
Hill Mann. Particular improvements in the tool in-
clude:

which allows users to be presented with statist-
ics regarding the proportional use of relations
in a text.
3. Output Options: the new tool allows saving
of RST analyses in postscript (for inclusion in
Latex documents), or sending diagrams directly
to the printer. Files are now saved in an XML
format, to facilitate importation in other sys-
tems.
4. Improved Structuring: the possibilities for
structuring have improved, allowing the in-
sertion of spans, multinuclear elements and
schemas within existing structure.
The Tool consists of four interfaces, which will be
described in following sections:
1. Text Segmentation: for marking the boundaries
between text segments;
2. Text Structuring: for marking the structural re-
lations between these segments;
3. Relation Editor for maintaining the set of dis-
course relations, and schernas;
4. Statistics: for deriving simple descriptive stat-
istics based on the analysis.
2 What is RSTTool For?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.970966444444444">
The RSTTool is an analysis tool, but most users of
the tool are researchers in the text generation field.
For this reason, we present the tool at this confer-
ence.
Several reasons for using the tool are:
6 Carpus Studies: before one can generate text,
one must understand the rhetorical patterns of
language. By performing analyses of texts sim-
ilar to which one wishes to generate, one can
identify the recurrent structures in the text-type
and work towards understanding their context
of use.
0, Results Verification: often, a particular stud
may he challenged by other researchers. if the
study was performed using RSTTool, the cor-
pus supporting the study can be released for
analysis by others. Previously, most RST ana-
lysis was done by hand. making distribution of

plifies the production of the corpus, but also
allows ease of distribution and verification.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.880386533333333">
e Diagram Preparation: the RSTTool can also be
used for diagram preparation, for inclusion in
papers. The toot allows diagrams to be expor-
ted as EPS files, ready for inclusion in LaTeX
documents (as demonstrated in this paper). For
PCs and Mac, screen-dumps of diagrams are
possible (Tcl/Tk does not yet fully support ex-
port of GIF or JPG formats, and conversion
from EPS to other formats is primitive). Some
versions of MS Word allow the inclusion of EPS
diagrams.
O A Teaching Tool: by getting students to analyse
texts with the RSTTool, teachers of discourse
theory can increase the student&apos;s understanding
of the theory.

<bodyText confidence="0.99952175">
To allow R.STTool analyses to be more generally
usable, the tool now saves its analyses in an XML
format, making loading into other systems for pro-
cessing much simpler.

3 Segmentation Interface
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99920784">
The first step in RST analysis is to determine seg-
ment boundaries. RSTTool provides an interface to
facilitate this task. The user starts by &amp;quot;importing&amp;quot; a
plain text file. The user can then automatically seg-
ment at sentence boundaries by pressing the &amp;quot;Sen-
tences&amp;quot; button. This segmentation is not 100% re-
liable, but is reasonably intelligent_ The user can
then correct any mistakes made by the automatic
segmentation, and also add in segment boundaries
within sentences.
To add a segment boundary, the user simply clicks
at the point of the text where the boundary is de-
sired. A boundary marker is inserted. To remove
a boundary, the user simply clicks on the boundary
marker. Figure 1 shows the Segmentation interface
after clausal segmentation.
The user can also edit the text, correcting mis-
takes, etc.,.by switching to Edit mode.
The user then moves to the Structuring interface
by clicking on the &amp;quot;Structurer&amp;quot; button at the top of
the window. Note that the user can return at any
point to the Segmentation interface, to change seg-
ment boundaries, or edit text. These changes are
automatically accounted for in the structuring com-
ponent.

as shown in figure 2. We have followed the graphical
style presented in Mann and Thompson (1988).
The tool supports not only RST structuring, but
also constituency structuring. I believe that texts
cannot always be analysed totally in terms of rhet-
orical relations, and that some level of schematic
analysis complements the rhetorical analysis. For
instance, a typical conference paper such as this

<bodyText confidence="0.39486925">
The RSTTool allows intermixing of such schema
with RST analysis.
Initially, all segments are unconnected, ordered at
the top of the window_ The user can then drag the
mouse from one segment (the satelite) to another
(the nucleus) to link them.
The system allows both plain RST relations and
also multi-nuclear relations (e.g., Joint., Sequence.

dicates that the nucleus of a relation is not a seg-
ment itself, but rather a segment and all of its satel-
lites. See figure 3 for an example combining normal
RST relations (Circumstance, Motivation); multi-
nuclear structure (Conjunction), and scoping (the
nodes marked 1-2 and 3-4). In addition, schernas
can be used to represent constituency-type struc-
tures. See figure 4.

ate, the RSTTool allows the user to collapse sub-
trees -- hiding the substructure under a node. This

<bodyText confidence="0.9994387">
Discussions on the RST mail list have demonstrated
that there is a community concern with frequency
of different relations in specific text-types. The
RSTTool, by providing counts of relations within a
text, supports this research goal. See figure 5.
The interface shows not only the frequency of re-
lations, but also the ratio of Nuc Sat orderings to
Sat Nuc orderings for the relation (valuable data for
both generation and automatic discourse structure
recognition).

7 Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997055">
RSTMoi is a robust tool which facilitates manual
analysis of a text&apos;s rhetorical structure. These ana-
lyses can be used for a number of purposes, including
i) to improve understanding of discourse structure,
to aid in either text generation or analysis; ii) dia-
gram preparation, and iii) as a teaching tool.
The main improvement in the latest version of the
tool is the statistical analysis interface. Later ver-
sions of the. tool will extend on this aspect, increas-
ing the range of analyses which can be performed on
each text, or collection of texts.
Future versions will also add code for automatic
structure recognition, using such work as Marcu&apos;s
RST recognition tool (Marco, 1997). While the au-
thor believes that automatic recognition is not yet.
