In this paper, we present a corpus-
based learning method that can
index diverse types of compound
nouns using rules automatically ex-
tracted from a large tagged corpus.
We develop an efficient way of ex-
tracting the compound noun index-
ing rules automatically and perform
extensive experiments to evaluate
our indexing rules. The automatic
learning method shows about the
same performance compared with
the manual linguistic approach but
is more portable and requires no
human efforts. We also evaluate
the seven different filtering meth-
ods based on both the effectiveness
and the efficiency, and present a
new method to solve the problems of
compound noun over-generation and
data sparseness in statistical com-
pound noun processing.

Compound nouns are more specific and ex-
pressive than simple nouns, so they are more
valuable as index terms and can increase
the precision in search experiments. There
are many definitions for the compound noun
which cause ambiguities as to whether a given
continuous noun sequence is a compound
noun or not. We, therefore, need a clean

definition of compound nouns in terms of in-
formation retrieval, so we define a compound
noun as &amp;quot;any continuous noun sequence that
appears frequently in documents.&amp;quot;&apos;
In Korean documents, compound nouns are
represented in various forms (shown in Table
1), so there is a difficulty in indexing all types
of compound nouns. Until now, there have
been much works on compound noun index-
ing, but they still have limitations of cover-
ing all types of compound nouns and require
much linguistic knowledge to accomplish this
goal. In this paper, we propose a corpus-
based learning method for compound noun
indexing which can extract the rules automat-
ically with little linguistic knowledge.

noun with regard to &amp;quot;jeong-bo geom-saeg (in-

jeong-bo geom-saeg (information retrieval)

(retrieving information)
jeong-bo-geom-sa.eg si-sen-tem
(information-retrieval system)
As the number of the documents is growing
retrieval, efficiency also becomes as important
as effectiveness. To increase the efficiency, we
focus on reducing the number of indexed spu-
rious compound nouns. We perform experi-
ments on several filtering methods to find the
algorithm that can reduce spurious compound
nouns most efficiently.

2.1 Compound Noun Indexing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994236869565217">
There have been two different methods
for compound noun indexing: statistical
and linguistic. In one statistical method,
(Fagan, 1989) indexed phrases using six
different parameters, including information
on co-occurrence of phrase elements, rela-
tive location of phrase elements, etc., and
achieved reasonable performance. However,
his method couldn&apos;t reveal consistent sub-
stantial improvements on five experimental
document collections in effectiveness. (Strza-
lkowski et al., 1996; Evans and Zhai, 1996)
indexed subcompounds from complex noun
phrases using noun-phrase analysis. These
methods need to find the head-modifier rela-
tions from noun phrases and therefore require
difficult syntactic parsing in Korean.
For Korean, in one statistical method, (Lee
and Ahn, 1996) indexed general Korean nouns
using n-grams without linguistic knowledge
and the experiment results showed that the
proposed method might be almost as effec-
tive as the linguistic noun indexing. How-
ever, this method can generate many spuri-
ous n-grams which decrease the precision in
search performance. In linguistic methods,
(Kim, 1994) used five manually chosen com-
pound noun indexing rule patterns based on
linguistic knowledge. However, this method
cannot index the diverse types of compound
nouns. (Won et al., 2000) used a full parser
and increased the precision in search experi-
ments. However, this linguistic method can-
not be applied to unrestricted texts robustly.
In summary, the previous methods,
whether they are statistical or linguistic,
have their own shortcomings. Statistical
methods require significant amounts of
co-occurrence information for reasonable
performance and can not index the diverse
types of compound nouns. Linguistic meth-
ods need compound noun indexing rules
described by human and sometimes result
in meaningless compound nouns, which
decreases the performance of information
retrieval systems. They cannot also cover the
various types of compound nouns because of
the limitation of human linguistic knowledge.
In this paper, we present a hybrid method
that uses linguistic rules but these rules are
automatically acquired from a large corpus
through statistical learning. Our method gen-
erates more diverse compound noun index-
ing rule patterns than the previous standard
methods (Kim, 1994; Lee et al., 1997), be-
cause previous methods use only most gen-
eral rule patterns (shown in Table 2) and are
based solely on human linguistic knowledge.

2.2 Compound Noun Filtering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996075">
Compound noun indexing methods, whether
they are statistical or linguistic, tend to gen-
erate spurious compound nouns when they
are actually applied. Since an information re-
trieval system can be evaluated by its effec-
tiveness and also by its efficiency (van Rijs-
bergen, 1979), the spurious compound nouns
should be efficiently filtered. (Kando et al.,
1998) insisted that, for Japanese, the smaller
the number of index terms is, the better the
performance of the information retrieval sys-
tem should be.

<bodyText confidence="0.999782863636364">
For Korean, (Won et al., 2000) showed
that segmentation of compound nouns is more
efficient than compound noun synthesis in
search performance. There have been many
works on compound noun filtering methods;
(Kim, 1994) used mutual information only,
and (Yun et al., 1997) used mutual informa-
tion and relative frequency of POS (Part-Of-
Speech) pairs together. (Lee et al., 1997) used
stop word dictionaries which were constructed
manually. Most of the previous methods for
compound noun filtering utilized only one
consistent method for generated compound
nouns irrespective of the different origin of
compound noun indexing rules, and the meth-
ods cause many problems due to data sparse-
ness in dictionary and training data. Our
approach solves the data sparseness problem
by using co-occurrence information on auto-
matically extracted compound noun elements
together with a statistical precision measure
which fits best to each rule.

The compound noun indexing system pro-
posed in this paper consists of two major
modules: one for automatically extracting
compound noun indexing rules (in Figure 1)
and the other for indexing documents, fil-
tering the automatically generated compound
nouns, and weighting the indexed compound
nouns (in Figure 2).

There are three major steps in automatically
extracting compound noun indexing rules.
The first step is to collect compound noun
statistical information, and the second step is
to extract the rules from a large tagged cor-
pus using the collected statistical information.
The final step is to learn each rule&apos;s precision.

4.2 Extracting Indexing Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99964080952381">
We define a template (in Table 5) to extract
the compound noun indexing rules from a
POS tagged corpus.
The template means that if a front-
condition-tag, a rear-condition-tag, and sub-
string-tags are coincident with input sentence
tags, the lexical item in the synthesis position
of the sentence can be indexed as a compound
noun as &amp;quot;x/ y (for 3-noun compounds, x /
y / z)&amp;quot;. The tags used in the template are
POS (Part-Of-Speech) tags and we use the
POSTAG set (Table 17).
The following is an algorithm to extract
compound noun indexing rules from a large
tagged corpus using the two-noun compound
seeds and the template defined above. The
rule extraction scope is limited to the end
of a sentence or, if there is a conjunctive
ending (eCC) in the sentence, only to the
conjunctive ending of the sentence. A rule
extraction example is shown in Figure 3.

The next step is to refine the extracted

frequency together with the heuristics that
the rules with negative lexical items (shown in
Table 6) will make spurious compound nouns.

The automatically extracted rules have
more rule patterns and lexical items than
human-made rules so they can cover more
diverse types of compound nouns (Table 8).
When checking the overlap between the two
rule collections, we found that the manual lin-
guistic rules are a subset of our automatically
generated statistical rules. Table 9 shows
some of the example rules newly generated
from our extraction algorithm, which were
originally missing in the manual rule patterns.

4.3 Learning the Precision of
Extracted Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989">
In the proposed method, we use the precision
of rules to solve the compound noun over-
generation and the data sparseness problems.
The precision of a rule can be defined by
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.628364">
Ncandidate
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961956521739">
where Prec(rule) is the precision of a rule,
Nactuai is the number of actual compound
nouns, and Ncandidate is the number of com-
pound noun candidates generated by the au-
tomatic indexing rules.
To calculate the precision, we need a defin-
ing measurement for compound noun identi-
fication. (Su et al., 1994) showed that the
average mutual information of a compound
noun tends to be higher than that of a non-
compound noun, so we try to use the mutual
information as the measure for identifying the
compound nouns. If the mutual information
of the compound noun candidate is higher
than the average mutual information of the
compound noun seeds, we decide that it is
a compound noun. For mutual information
(MI), we use two different equations: one for
two-element compound nouns (Church and
Hanks, 1990) and the other for three-element
compound nouns (Su et al., 1994). The equa-
tion for two-element compound nouns is as
follow:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999287">

I(x; y) = log2

</equation>
<page confidence="0.984154">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.939542913043478">
where x and y are two words in the corpus,
and /(x; y) is the mutual information of these
two words (in this order). Table 10 shows
the average MI value of the two and three
elements.
Table 10: Average value of the mutual infor-
mation (MI) of compound noun seeds
Number of elements 2 3
Average MI 3.56 3.62
The MI was calculated from the statistics of
the complete compound nouns collected from
the tagged training corpus (see Section 4.1).
However, complete compound nouns are
continuous noun sequences and cause the
data sparseness problem. Therefore, we need
to expand the statistics. Figure 4 shows
the architecture of the precision learning
module by expanding the statistics of the
complete compound nouns along with an
algorithmic explanation (Algorithm 3) of the
process. Table 11 shows the improvement in
the average precision during the repetitive
execution of this learning process.

To index compound nouns from documents,

gine) (Cha et al., 1998), which processes doc-
uments by analysing words into morphemes
and tagging part-of-speeches. The tagging
results are compared with the automatically
learned compound noun indexing rules and, if
they are coincident with each other, we index
them as compound nouns. Figure 5 shows a

into three categories: first one using MI, sec-

MI (Mutual Information) is a measure of word
association, and used under the assumption
that a highly associated word n-gram is more
likely to be a compound noun. FC is used
under the assumption that a frequently en-
countered word n-gram is more likely to be a
compound than a rarely encountered n-gram.
FE is used under the assumption that a word
n-gram with a frequently encountered specific
element is more likely to be a compound. In
the method of C, D, E, and F, each threshold
was decided by calculating the average num-
ber of compound nouns of each method.

To calculate the similarity between a docu-

model (Fox, 1983) and use 2.0 as the p-value.
We also use the component nouns in a com-
pound as the indexing terms. We follow the
standard TREC evaluation schemes (Salton
and Buckley, 1991). For single index terms,
we use the weighting method atn.ntc (Lee,

6.2 Retrieval Experiments Using
Various Filtering Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996975">
In this experiment, we compare the seven fil-
tering methods to find out which one is the
best in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
For this experiment, we used our automatic
rules for the compound noun indexing, and
the test collection KTSET2.0. To check the
effectiveness, we used recall and 11-point av-
erage precision. To check the efficiency, we
used the number of index terms. Table 16
shows the results of the various filtering ex-
periments.
From Table 16, the methods using mu-
tual information reduce the number of in-
dex terms, whereas they have lower precision.
The reason of this lower precision is that MI
has a bias, i.e., scoring in favor of rare terms
over common terms, so MI seems to have a
problem in its sensitivity to probability es-
timation error (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).
In this experiment6, we see that method B
generates the smallest number of compound
nouns (best efficiency) and our final propos-
ing method H has the best recall and precision
(effectiveness) with the reasonable number of
compound nouns (efficiency). We can con-
clude that the filtering method H is the best,
considering the effectiveness and the efficiency
at the same time.

In this paper, we presented a method to ex-

tomatically from a large tagged corpus, and
showed that this method can index compound
nouns appearing in diverse types of docu-

In the view of effectiveness, this method is
slightly better than the previous linguistic ap-
proaches but requires no human effort.
The proposed method also uses no parser
and no rules described by humans, there-
fore, it can be applied to unrestricted texts

to solve the compound noun over-generation
problem. Our proposed filtering method (H)
shows good retrieval performance both in the
view of the effectiveness and the efficiency.
In the future, we need to perform some
experiments on much larger commercial
databases to test the practicality of our
method.
Finally, our method doesn&apos;t require lan-
guage dependent knowledge, so it needs to be
verified whether it can be easily applied to

The tagging results are compared with the automatically learned compound noun indexing rules and, if they are coincident with each other, we index them as compound nouns. Figure 5 shows a process of the compound noun indexing with an example. 5.2 Compound Noun Filtering Among the indexed compound nouns above, still there can be meaningless compound nouns, which increases the number of index terms and the search time.

To calculate the precision, we need a defining measurement for compound noun identification. (Su et al., 1994) showed that the average mutual information of a compound noun tends to be higher than that of a noncompound noun, so we try to use the mutual information as the measure for identifying the compound nouns. If the mutual information of the compound noun candidate is higher than the average mutual information of the compound noun seeds, we decide that it is a compound noun. For mutual information (MI), we use two different equations: one for two-element compound nouns (Church and Hanks, 1990) and the other for three-element compound nouns (Su et al., 1994). The equation for two-element compound nouns is as follow: P(x,y) I(x; y) = log2 P(x) x P(y) 61 where x and y are two words in the corpus, and /(x; y) is the mutual information of these two words (in this order). Table 10 shows the average MI value of the two and three elements.

Since an information retrieval system can be evaluated by its effectiveness and also by its efficiency (van Rijsbergen, 1979), the spurious compound nouns should be efficiently filtered. (Kando et al., 1998) insisted that, for Japanese, the smaller the number of index terms is, the better the performance of the information retrieval system should be. 58 For Korean, (Won et al., 2000) showed that segmentation of compound nouns is more efficient than compound noun synthesis in search performance. There have been many works on compound noun filtering methods; (Kim, 1994) used mutual information only, and (Yun et al., 1997) used mutual information and relative frequency of POS (Part-OfSpeech) pairs together.

Linguistic methods need compound noun indexing rules described by human and sometimes result in meaningless compound nouns, which decreases the performance of information retrieval systems. They cannot also cover the various types of compound nouns because of the limitation of human linguistic knowledge. In this paper, we present a hybrid method that uses linguistic rules but these rules are automatically acquired from a large corpus through statistical learning. Our method generates more diverse compound noun indexing rule patterns than the previous standard methods (Kim, 1994; Lee et al., 1997), because previous methods use only most general rule patterns (shown in Table 2) and are based solely on human linguistic knowledge. Table 2: Typical hand-written compound noun indexing rule patterns for Korean Noun without case makers / Noun Noun with a genitive case maker / Noun Noun with a nominal case maker or an accusative case maker / Verbal common noun or adjectival common noun Noun with an adnominal ending / Noun Noun within predicate particle phrase / Noun (The two nouns before and after a slash in the pattern can form a single compound noun.) 2.2 Compound Noun Filtering Compound nou</context>

Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 7. 2 Previous Research 2.1 Compound Noun Indexing There have been two different methods for compound noun indexing: statistical and linguistic. In one statistical method, (Fagan, 1989) indexed phrases using six different parameters, including information on co-occurrence of phrase elements, relative location of phrase elements, etc., and achieved reasonable performance. However, his method couldn&apos;t reveal consistent substantial improvements on five experimental document collections in effectiveness. (Strzalkowski et al., 1996; Evans and Zhai, 1996) indexed subcompounds from complex noun phrases using noun-phrase analysis. These methods need to find the head-modifier relations from noun phrases and therefore require difficult syntactic parsing in Korean. For Korean, in one statistical method, (Lee and Ahn, 1996) indexed general Korean nouns using n-grams without linguistic knowledge and the experiment results showed that the proposed method might be almost as effective as the linguistic noun indexing.

The precision of a rule can be defined by Ncandidate where Prec(rule) is the precision of a rule, Nactuai is the number of actual compound nouns, and Ncandidate is the number of compound noun candidates generated by the automatic indexing rules. To calculate the precision, we need a defining measurement for compound noun identification. (Su et al., 1994) showed that the average mutual information of a compound noun tends to be higher than that of a noncompound noun, so we try to use the mutual information as the measure for identifying the compound nouns. If the mutual information of the compound noun candidate is higher than the average mutual information of the compound noun seeds, we decide that it is a compound noun. For mutual information (MI), we use two different equations: one for two-element compound nouns (Church and Hanks, 1990) and the other for three-element compound nouns (Su et al., 1994). The equation for two-element compound </context>
