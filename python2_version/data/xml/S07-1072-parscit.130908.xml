Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99995725">
This paper presents a headline emotion clas-
sification approach based on frequency and
co-occurrence information collected from
the World Wide Web. The content words of
a headline (nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjec-
tives) are extracted in order to form different
bag of word pairs with the joy, disgust, fear,
anger, sadness and surprise emotions. For
each pair, we compute the Mutual Informa-
tion Score which is obtained from the web
occurrences of an emotion and the content
words. Our approach is based on the hypoth-
esis that group of words which co-occur to-
gether across many documents with a given
emotion are highly probable to express the
same emotion.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999906333333334">
The subjective analysis of a text is becoming impor-
tant for many Natural Language Processing (NLP)
applications such as Question Answering, Informa-
tion Extraction, Text Categorization among others
(Shanahan et al., 2006). The resolution of this prob-
lem can lead to a complete, realistic and coher-
ent analysis of the natural language, therefore ma-
jor attention is drawn to the opinion, sentiment and
emotion analysis, and to the identification of be-
liefs, thoughts, feelings and judgments (Quirk et al.,
1985), (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005).
The aim of the Affective Text task is to clas-
sify a set of news headlines into six types of emo-
tions: “anger”, “disgust”, “fear”, “joy”, “sadness”
and “surprise”. In order to be able to conduct
such multi-category analysis, we believe that first
we need a comprehensive theory of what a human
emotion is, and then we need to understand how the
emotion is expressed and transmitted within the nat-
ural language. These aspects rise the need of syn-
tactic, semantic, textual and pragmatic analysis of
a text (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006). However, some
of the major drawbacks in this field are related to
the manual or automatic acquisition of subjective ex-
pressions, as well as to the lack of resources in terms
of coverage.
For this reason, our current emotion classification
approach is based on frequency and co-occurrence
bag of word counts collected from the World Wide
Web. Our hypothesis is that words which tend to co-
occur across many documents with a given emotion
are highly probable to express this emotion.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2 we review some of the related work, in
Section 3 we describe our web-based emotion classi-
fication approach for which we show a walk-through
example in Section 4. A discussion of the obtained
results can be found in Section 5 and finally we con-
clude in Section 6.

Our approach for emotion classification is based on
the idea of (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997)
and is similar to those of (Turney, 2002) and (Tur-
ney and Littman, 2003). According to Hatzivas-
siloglou and McKeown (1997), adjectives with the
same polarity tended to appear together. For exam-
ple the negative adjectives “corrupt and brutal” co-

occur very often.
The idea of tracing polarity through adjective co-
occurrence is adopted by Turney (2002) for the bi-
nary (positive and negative) classification of text re-
views. They take two adjectives, for instance “ex-
cellent” and “poor” in a way that the first adjective
expresses positive meaning, meanwhile the second
one expresses negative. Then, they extract all ad-
jectives from the review text and combine them with
“excellent” and “poor”. The co-occurrences of these
words are searched on the web, and then the Mutual
Information score for the two groups of adjectives
is measured. When the adjective of the review ap-
pear more often with “excellent”, then the review is
classified as positive, and when the adjectives appear
more often with “poor”, then the review is classified
as negative.
Following Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997)
and Turney (2002), we decided to observe how often
the words from the headline co-occur with each one
of the six emotions. This study helped us deduce
information according to which “birthday” appears
more often with “joy”, while “war” appears more
often with “fear”.
Some of the differences between our approach
and those of Turney (2002) are mentioned below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.611195">
• objectives: Turney (2002) aims at binary text

classification, while our objective is six class
classification of one-liner headlines. Moreover,
we have to provide a score between 0 and 100
indicating the presence of an emotion, and not
simply to identify what the emotion in the text
is. Apart from the difficulty introduced by the
multi-category classification, we have to deal
with a small number of content words while
Turney works with large list of adjectives.
• word class: Turney (2002) measures polarity
using only adjectives, however in our approach
we consider the noun, the verb, the adverb and
the adjective content words. The motivation
of our study comes from (Polanyi and Zaenen,
2006), according to which each content word
can express sentiment and emotion. In addition
to this issue we saw that most of the headlines
contain only nouns and verbs, because they ex-
press objectivity.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984597266666667">
• search engines: Turney (2002) uses the Al-
tavista web browser, while we consider and
combine the frequency information acquired
from three web search engines.
• word proximity: For the web searches, Tur-
ney (2002) uses the NEAR operator and con-
siders only those documents that contain the
adjectives within a specific proximity. In our
approach, as far as the majority of the query
words appear in the documents, the frequency
count is considered.
• queries: The queries of Turney (2002) are made
up of a pair of adjectives, and in our approach
the query contains the content words of the
headline and an emotion.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999386875">
There are other emotion classification approaches
that use the web as a source of information. For
instance, (Taboada et al., 2006) extracted from the
web co-occurrences of adverbs, adjectives, nouns
and verbs. Gamon and Aue (2005) were looking
for adjectives that did not co-occur at sentence level.
(Baroni and Vegnaduzzo, 2004) and (Grefenstette
et al., 2004) gathered subjective adjectives from the
web calculating the Mutual Information score.
Other important works on sentiment analysis are
those of (Wilson et al., 2005) and (Wiebe et al.,
2005; Wilson and Wiebe, 2005), who used linguistic
information such as syntax and negations to deter-
mine polarity. Kim and Hovy (2006) integrated verb
information from FrameNet and incorporated it into
semantic role labeling.

in our experiments because it provides information

In the trail data, besides the MI score of an emo-
tion and all headline content words, we have calcu-
lated the MI for an emotion and each one of the con-
tent words. This allowed us to determine the most
sentiment oriented word in the headline and then we
use this predominant emotion to weight the associ-
ation sentiment score for the whole text. Unfortu-
nately, we could not provide results for the test data
set, due to the high number of emotion-content word
pairs and the increment in processing time and re-
turned responses of the search engines.

As a walk through example, we use the Mortar as-
sault leaves at least 18 dead headline which is taken
from the trial data. The first step in our emotion clas-
sification approach consists in the determination of
the part-of-speech tags for the one-liner. The non-
content words are stripped away, and the rest of the
words are taken for web queries. To calculate the MI
score of a headline, we query the three search en-
gines combining “mortar, assault, leave, dead” with
the anger, joy, disgust, fear, sadness and surprise
emotions. The obtained results are normalized in a
range from 0 to 100 and are shown in Table 1.

As can be seen from the table, the three search
engines provide different sentiment distribution for
the same headline, therefore in our final experiment
we decided to calculate intermediate MI. Comparing
our results to those of the gold standard, we can say
that our approach detects significantly well the fear,
sadness and angry emotions.

Table 2 shows the obtained results for the affective
test data. The low performance of our approach
is explainable by the minimal knowledge we have
used. An interesting conclusion deduced from the
trail and test emotion data is that the system detects
better the negative feelings such as anger, disgust,
fear and sadness, in comparison to the positive emo-
tions such as joy and surprise. This makes us believe
that according to the web most of the word-emotion
combinations we queried are related to the expres-
sion of negative emotions.

In the test run, we could not apply the emotion-
word weighting, however we believe that it has
a significant impact over the final performance.
Presently, we were looking for the distribution of all
content words and the emotions, but in the future we
would like to transform all words into adjectives and
then conduct web queries.
Furthermore, we would like to combine the re-
sults from the web emotion classification with the
polarity information given by SentiWordNet4. A-
priory we want to disambiguate the headline content
words and to determine the polarities of the words
and their corresponding senses. For instance, the ad-
jective “new” has eleven senses, where new#a#3 and
new#a#5 express negativism, new#a#4 and new#a#9
positivism and the rest of the senses are objective.

data repositories. To surmount the data sparsity
problem, we used as corpus the World Wide Web
which is constantly growing and daily updated.
Our statistical information is collected from three
web search engines: MyWay1, AlltheWeb2 and Ya-
hoo3. It is interesting to note that the emotion dis-
tribution provided by each one of the search engines
for the same headline has different scores. For this
reason, we decided to compute an intermediate MI

So far we did not consider the impact of valence
shifter (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006) and we were un-
able to detect that a negative adverb or adjective
transforms the emotion from positive into negative
and vice versa. We are also interested in studying
how to conduct queries not as a bag of words but
bind by syntactic relations (Wilson et al., 2005).

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967">
Emotion classification is a challenging and difficult
task in Natural Language Processing. For our first
attempt to detect the amount of angry, fear, sadness,
surprise, disgust and joy emotions, we have pre-
sented a simple web co-occurrence approach. We
have combined the frequency count information of
three search engines and we have measured the Mu-
tual Information score between a bag of content
words and emotion.
According to the yielded results, the presented ap-
proach can determine whether one sentiment is pre-
dominant or not, and most of the correct sentiment
assignments correspond to the negative emotions.
However, we need to improve the approach in many
aspects and to incorporate more knowledge-rich re-
sources, as well as to tune the 0-100 emotion scale.

According to Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), adjectives with the same polarity tended to appear together. For example the negative adjectives “corrupt and brutal” co334 Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval-2007), pages 334–337, Prague, June 2007. c�2007 Association for Computational Linguistics occur very often.

Then, they extract all adjectives from the review text and combine them with “excellent” and “poor”. The co-occurrences of these words are searched on the web, and then the Mutual Information score for the two groups of adjectives is measured. When the adjective of the review appear more often with “excellent”, then the review is classified as positive, and when the adjectives appear more often with “poor”, then the review is classified as negative. Following Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) and Turney (2002), we decided to observe how often the words from the headline co-occur with each one of the six emotions. This study helped us deduce information according to which “birthday” appears more often with “joy”, while “war” appears more often with “fear”. Some of the differences between our approach and those of Turney (2002) are mentioned below: • objectives: Turney (2002) aims at binary text classification, while our objective is six class classification of one-liner headlines. Moreover, we have to provide a score between 0 and 100 indicating the presence of an emotion, and not </context>

The aim of the Affective Text task is to classify a set of news headlines into six types of emotions: “anger”, “disgust”, “fear”, “joy”, “sadness” and “surprise”. In order to be able to conduct such multi-category analysis, we believe that first we need a comprehensive theory of what a human emotion is, and then we need to understand how the emotion is expressed and transmitted within the natural language. These aspects rise the need of syntactic, semantic, textual and pragmatic analysis of a text (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006). However, some of the major drawbacks in this field are related to the manual or automatic acquisition of subjective expressions, as well as to the lack of resources in terms of coverage. For this reason, our current emotion classification approach is based on frequency and co-occurrence bag of word counts collected from the World Wide Web.
