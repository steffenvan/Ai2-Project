A morphological analyzer forms the
foundation for many NLP applications of
Indian Languages. In this paper, we pro-
pose and evaluate the morphological
analyzer for Marathi, an inflectional lan-
guage. The morphological analyzer ex-
ploits the efficiency and flexibility of-
fered by finite state machines in model-
ing the morphotactics while using the
well devised system of paradigms to
handle the stem alternations intelligently
by exploiting the regularity in inflection-
al forms. We plug the morphological
analyzer with statistical pos tagger and
chunker to see its impact on their per-
formance so as to confirm its usability as
a foundation for NLP applications.

1 Motivation and Problem Definition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942648148148">
A highly inflectional language has the capability
of generating hundreds of words from a single
root. Hence, morphological analysis is vital for
high level applications to understand various
words in the language. Morphological analyzer
forms the foundation for applications like infor-
mation retrieval, POS tagging, chunking and
ultimately the machine translation. Morphologi-
cal analyzers for various languages have been
studied and developed for years. But, this re-
search is dominated by the morphological ana-
lyzers for agglutinative languages or for the lan-
guages like English that show low degree of in-
flection. Though agglutinative languages show
high morpheme per word ratio and have com-
plex morphotactic structures, the absence of fu-
sion at morpheme boundaries makes the task of
segmentation fluent once the model for imple-
mentation of morphotactics is ready. On this
background, a morphological analyzer for highly
inflectional language like Marathi which has the
tendency to overlay the morphemes in a way that
aggravates the task of segmentation presents an
interesting case study.
Eryiğit and Adalı (2004) propose a suf-
fix stripping approach for Turkish. The rule
based and agglutinative nature of Turkish allows
the language to be modeled using FSMs and
does not need a lexicon. The morphological ana-
lyzer does not face the problem of the changes
taking place at morpheme boundaries which is
not the case with inflectional languages. Hence,
although apprehensible this model is not suffi-
cient for handling the morphology of Marathi.
Many morphological analyzers have
been developed using the two-level morphologi-
cal model (Koskenniemi, 1983) for
morphological analysis. (Oflazer, 1993; Kim et
al., 1994) have been developed using PC-
Kimmo (Antworth, 1991), a morphological
parser based on the two-level model. Concep-
tually, the model segments the word in its con-
stituent parts, and accounts for phonological and
orthographical changes within a word. While,
the model proves to be very useful for develop-
ing the morphological analyzers for agglutina-
tive languages or the languages with very less
degree of inflection, it fails to explicitly capture
the regularities within and between paradigms
present in the inflectional languages. Marathi
has a well defined paradigm-based system of
inflection. Hence, we decided to develop our
own model which works on the similar lines of
PC-Kimmo (Antworth, 1991) but exploits the

usefulness of paradigm-based inflectional sys-
tem.
Bharati et al. (2004) propose a paradigm
based algorithm for morphological analysis of
Hindi, an inflecting language. In Hindi, the in-
flected forms of roots do not allow further at-
tachment of any other suffixes. In contrast, in
Marathi once the root is transformed into its in-
flected form it is followed by suffixes to show
its agreement with the other words in the sen-
tence. Some postpositions derive new words
which themselves may undergo inflection and
allow attachment of other suffixes. This makes
the simple paradigm-based model proposed in
this work unfit for Marathi morphological analy-
sis.
Dixit et al. (2006) developed a morphological
analyzer with a purpose of using it for spell
checking. Though their analyzer successfully
analyzes the words with a single suffix, its scope
is restricted to the handling of only first level
suffixes.

1.1 Our Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984684210526">
In this paper, we present the morphological
analyzer for Marathi which is official language
of the state of Maharashtra (India). With 90
million fluent speakers worldwide, Marathi
ranks as the 4th most spoken language in India
and the 15th most in the world. The methodology
is based on the use of paradigm-based
inflectional system combined with finite state
machines (FSMs) for modeling the
morphotactics. To the best of our knowledge,
such an approach has never been tried out for
Marathi. The crux of the system lies in the
detailed study of morphosyntactic phenomena,
the morphotactic structure of the language and
the use of paradigm-based inflectional system.
The approach can be used for other inflection-
al languages by developing the resources like
language specific inflection rules and the FSM
that models the morphotactics for the language.

1.2 Marathi Morphology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993888772727273">
Marathi is a morphologically rich language. It is
highly inflectional and also shows derivation to
a high degree. Like other synthetic languages,
Marathi morphological analysis faces some
well-known challenges. Words contain multiple
morphemes fused together in such a way that, it
becomes difficult to segment them. A single
morpheme contains a bunch of grammatical
attributes associated with it which creates a chal-
lenge for morphological parsing. A single root is
capable of generating hundreds of words by
combining with the other morphemes.
The complexity involved in the formation of a
polymorphemic word can be better illustrated
using an example. Consider the word
{devaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the one
like the god). The nominal root ‘ ’ {deva}
(god) gets inflected to the oblique case, singular
form ‘ ’ {devaa} which is then followed by
the adjectival suffix ‘ ’ {saarakhaa} (alike).
This derives the adjective ‘ ’ {devaa-
saarakhaa} (the one like the god) which then
starts behaving like a noun. This noun on getting
inflected to the oblique case, singular form
{devasaarakhyaa} is followed by the
case marker {laa} (to). This gives the word
{devaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the one
like the god). Equation 1 illustrates this process.
Equation 1. Formation of {de-
vaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the one like the god)
This suggests that the process of formation of
polymorphemic words is recursive in nature with
inflection taking place at every level of recur-
sion.
Section 2 discusses the design of the morpho-
logical analyzer which tries to overcome the
problems discussed above with respect to Mara-
thi language. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the lin-
guistic resources and the processing of words
belonging to various categories respectively.
Sections 5 and discuss the classification of suf-
fixes and development of automata based on this
classification respectively. Section 7 briefs on
the experimental setup and the results.

The formation of polymorphemic words leads to
complexities which need to be handled during
the analysis process. FSMs prove to be elegant
and computationally efficient tools for modeling
the suffix ordering in such words. However, the
recursive process of word formation in Marathi
involves inflection at the time of attachment of
every new suffix. The FSMs need to be capable
of handling them. Koskenniemi (1983) suggests
the use of separate FSMs to model the ortho-
graphic changes. But, Marathi has a well devised
system of paradigms to handle them. One of our
observations led us to a solution that combines
paradigm-based inflectional system with FSM
for modeling. The observation was that, during
the ith recursion only (i-1)th morpheme changes
its form which can be handled by suitably mod-
ifying the FSM. The formation of the same word
devaasaarakhyaalaa described above can be
viewed as illustrated in Equation 2.
Equation 2. Simulating the formation of
{devaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the
one like the god)
Generalizing the word formation process we ar-
rived at the formulation specified by Equation 3.
Equation 3. Formulation of Polymorphemic
Word Formation
This requires a morphotactic FSM which is
aware of the inflected forms of morphemes in
addition to the actual morphemes to handle the
above recursive process of word formation. We
use the paradigm-based system to generate the
inflected form of the morphemes and feed them
to the FSM. Figure 1 shows the architecture of
the morphological analyzer based on this philos-
ophy.
Inflector inflects all morphemes in the lex-
icon using the inflection rules associated with
the paradigms to which they belong.
Given a word, Morphological Recognizer
recognizes the constituent morphemes in their
inflected forms using finite state machine that
models the morphotactics. For example, the out-
put of the Morphological Recognizer for the
word devaasaarakhyaalaa is devaa + saarakhyaa
+ laa. Morphological Parser outputs per mor-
pheme analysis of the word using the mor-
phemes recognized by the Morphological Re-
cognizer.

4.1 Noun Morphology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99886795">
Marathi nouns inflect for number and case.
Postpositions get attached to the oblique forms
of the nouns (known as stems) to show their re-
lationship with other words in the sentence. A
single stem is used for the attachment of all
postpositions which makes nominal morphology
absolute economic in nature. For example vari-
ous forms of the word {daara} (door) are
{daaraasa} (to the door), {daa-
raane} (by the door), {daaraashejarii}
(besides the door). Please note that the same
stem {daaraa} is used for the attachment of
various postpositions.
Depending upon their ending, gender
and the inflectional patterns, the nouns in Mara-
thi can be classified into various paradigms. A
paradigm is a complete set of related inflectional
forms associated with a given root. All words
that share the similar inflectional forms fall in
the same paradigm. Table 1 presents the para-

{kaapaDa} (cloth), {paana} (leaf),
{pustaka} (book), {kapaaTa} (cup-

digm.
Every paradigm has a set of inflection rules
associated with it one corresponding to every
inflectional form of the word. A noun has four
inflectional forms each one corresponding to a
case-number pair. Hence, every paradigm has
four inflectional rules associated with it.
An inflectional rule for Marathi consists of a
tuple specifying the inflectional suffixes that
should be inserted and deleted from ultimate and
penultimate position of the root. Table 2 lists the
inflectional suffixes that collectively form an
inflectional rule.
The procedure to obtain the inflected form
of the given root R belonging to paradigm P by
applying the inflectional rule I &lt;UD, UI, PUD,
PUI&gt; is as follows:

In this way, our lexicon contains 16448 nouns
categorized into 76 paradigms. Out of the 76
paradigms, 30 correspond to feminine gender, 29
to masculine and 17 to neuter gender. This set of
paradigms includes three null paradigms, one
corresponding to each gender. In modern Mara-
thi, the stem of the proper nouns or foreign
words transliterated in Marathi is same as the
root. In short, postpositions can be directly at-
tached to these roots without any modification.

4.4 Verbs

<bodyText confidence="0.99994802631579">
The verbs inflect for gender, number and person
of the subject and the direct object in a sentence.
They also inflect for tense and aspect of the ac-
tion as well as mood of the speaker in an illocu-
tionary act. They may even undergo derivation.
Further discussion on verbal morphology will be
based on Aakhyaata theory (inflection) and Kru-
danta theory (derivation) (Damale, 1970). Our
lexicon contains 1160 verb roots classified into
22 paradigms.
Aakhyaata Theory forms the basis of
verbal inflection in Marathi. Aakhyaata
refers to tense, aspect, and mood. Aakhyaata is
realized through an aakhyaata suffix which is a
closing suffix, attached to the verb root. There
are 8 types of aakhyaatas named after the pho-
nemic shape of the aakhyaata suffix. Associated
with every aakhyaata are various aakhyaata-
arthas which indicate the features: tense, aspect
and mood. An aakhyaata may or may not agree
with gender. There are around 80 Aakhyaata
suffixes in Marathi.
Krudanta Theory forms the basis of
verbal derivation in Marathi. Krudanta refers to
the word ending in a krut-pratyaya (a suffix
which refers to an action). Krut-pratyayas are
attached at the end of verbs to form non-
infinitive verb forms. These forms usually be-
long to one of the categories: noun, adverb or
adjective. They contribute to the aspect of the
verb from which they are derived. We cover on-
ly the krudanta forms which are regular in beha-
vior.
Irregular Verbs: Some verbs in Marathi have
different behavior as compared to the other
verbs (regular verbs). These verbs are present in
some inflected forms for which no definite stem
exists.

present. Note that, in order to emphasize more
on the usefulness of our approach towards mor-
phological analysis of Marathi, we added most
of the roots used in the corpus to the lexicon be-
fore starting the experiments. For a language like
Marathi, it is required to build a very rich lex-
icon which can be done over a larger period of
time.
Out of the 21096 unique words, 20503
(97.18%) were found to be correctly analyzed.
Of the remaining 593 words, 394 words could
not be recognized by Morphological Recognizer
and 199 words were assigned the incorrect or
insufficient analyses.
By taking a closer look at the 394 words
which were not recognized (segmented) we
could come up with the causes of recognition
failure as listed in Table 6.

<abstract confidence="0.996850225941422">A morphological analyzer forms the foundation for many NLP applications of Indian Languages. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the morphological analyzer for Marathi, an inflectional language. The morphological analyzer exploits the efficiency and flexibility offered by finite state machines in modeling the morphotactics while using the well devised system of paradigms to handle the stem alternations intelligently by exploiting the regularity in inflectional forms. We plug the morphological analyzer with statistical pos tagger and chunker to see its impact on their performance so as to confirm its usability as a foundation for NLP applications. 1 Motivation and Problem Definition A highly inflectional language has the capability of generating hundreds of words from a single root. Hence, morphological analysis is vital for high level applications to understand various words in the language. Morphological analyzer forms the foundation for applications like information retrieval, POS tagging, chunking and ultimately the machine translation. Morphological analyzers for various languages have been studied and developed for years. But, this research is dominated by the morphological analyzers for agglutinative languages or for the languages like English that show low degree of inflection. Though agglutinative languages show high morpheme per word ratio and have commorphotactic structures, the absence of fusion at morpheme boundaries makes the task of segmentation fluent once the model for implementation of morphotactics is ready. On this background, a morphological analyzer for highly inflectional language like Marathi which has the tendency to overlay the morphemes in a way that aggravates the task of segmentation presents an interesting case study. propose a suffix stripping approach for Turkish. The rule based and agglutinative nature of Turkish allows the language to be modeled using FSMs and does not need a lexicon. The morphological analyzer does not face the problem of the changes taking place at morpheme boundaries which is not the case with inflectional languages. Hence, although apprehensible this model is not sufficient for handling the morphology of Marathi. Many morphological analyzers have been developed using the two-level morphological model (Koskenniemi, 1983) for analysis. 1993; Kim et al., 1994) have been developed using PC- Kimmo (Antworth, 1991), a morphological parser based on the two-level model. Conceptually, the model segments the word in its constituent parts, and accounts for phonological and orthographical changes within a word. While, the model proves to be very useful for developing the morphological analyzers for agglutinative languages or the languages with very less degree of inflection, it fails to explicitly capture the regularities within and between paradigms present in the inflectional languages. Marathi has a well defined paradigm-based system of inflection. Hence, we decided to develop our own model which works on the similar lines of PC-Kimmo (Antworth, 1991) but exploits the 26 of the 1st Workshop on South and Southeast Asian Natural Language Processing pages 26–34, 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics Beijing, August 2010 usefulness of paradigm-based inflectional system. Bharati et al. (2004) propose a paradigm based algorithm for morphological analysis of Hindi, an inflecting language. In Hindi, the inflected forms of roots do not allow further attachment of any other suffixes. In contrast, in Marathi once the root is transformed into its inflected form it is followed by suffixes to show its agreement with the other words in the sentence. Some postpositions derive new words which themselves may undergo inflection and allow attachment of other suffixes. This makes the simple paradigm-based model proposed in this work unfit for Marathi morphological analysis. Dixit et al. (2006) developed a morphological analyzer with a purpose of using it for spell checking. Though their analyzer successfully analyzes the words with a single suffix, its scope is restricted to the handling of only first level suffixes. 1.1 Our Approach In this paper, we present the morphological analyzer for Marathi which is official language of the state of Maharashtra (India). With 90 million fluent speakers worldwide, Marathi as the most spoken language in India the most in the world. The methodology is based on the use of paradigm-based inflectional system combined with finite state machines (FSMs) for modeling the morphotactics. To the best of our knowledge, such an approach has never been tried out for Marathi. The crux of the system lies in the detailed study of morphosyntactic phenomena, the morphotactic structure of the language and the use of paradigm-based inflectional system. The approach can be used for other inflectional languages by developing the resources like language specific inflection rules and the FSM that models the morphotactics for the language. 1.2 Marathi Morphology Marathi is a morphologically rich language. It is highly inflectional and also shows derivation to a high degree. Like other synthetic languages, Marathi morphological analysis faces some well-known challenges. Words contain multiple morphemes fused together in such a way that, it becomes difficult to segment them. A single morpheme contains a bunch of grammatical attributes associated with it which creates a challenge for morphological parsing. A single root is capable of generating hundreds of words by combining with the other morphemes. The complexity involved in the formation of a polymorphemic word can be better illustrated using an example. Consider the word {devaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the one the god). nominal root ‘ ’ {deva} (god) gets inflected to the oblique case, singular form ‘ ’ {devaa} which is then followed by adjectival suffix ’ {saarakhaa} (alike). derives the adjective ‘ ’ saarakhaa} (the one like the god) which then starts behaving like a noun. This noun on getting inflected to the oblique case, singular form {devasaarakhyaa} is followed by the case marker {laa} (to). This gives the word {devaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the one like the god). Equation 1 illustrates this process. 1. Formation of {devaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the one like the god) This suggests that the process of formation of polymorphemic words is recursive in nature with inflection taking place at every level of recursion. Section 2 discusses the design of the morphological analyzer which tries to overcome the problems discussed above with respect to Marathi language. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the linguistic resources and the processing of words belonging to various categories respectively. Sections 5 and discuss the classification of suffixes and development of automata based on this classification respectively. Section 7 briefs on the experimental setup and the results. 27 Figure 1. Architecture of Marathi Morphological Analyzer 2 Morphological Analyzer for Marathi The formation of polymorphemic words leads to complexities which need to be handled during the analysis process. FSMs prove to be elegant and computationally efficient tools for modeling the suffix ordering in such words. However, the recursive process of word formation in Marathi involves inflection at the time of attachment of every new suffix. The FSMs need to be capable of handling them. Koskenniemi (1983) suggests the use of separate FSMs to model the orthographic changes. But, Marathi has a well devised system of paradigms to handle them. One of our observations led us to a solution that combines paradigm-based inflectional system with FSM for modeling. The observation was that, during recursion only morpheme changes its form which can be handled by suitably modifying the FSM. The formation of the same word devaasaarakhyaalaa described above can be as illustrated in Equation Equation 2. Simulating the formation of {devaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the one like the god) Generalizing the word formation process we arrived at the formulation specified by Equation 3. Equation 3. Formulation of Polymorphemic Word Formation This requires a morphotactic FSM which is aware of the inflected forms of morphemes in addition to the actual morphemes to handle the above recursive process of word formation. We use the paradigm-based system to generate the inflected form of the morphemes and feed them to the FSM. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the morphological analyzer based on this philosophy. Inflector inflects all morphemes in the lexicon using the inflection rules associated with the paradigms to which they belong. Given a word, Morphological Recognizer recognizes the constituent morphemes in their inflected forms using finite state machine that models the morphotactics. For example, the output of the Morphological Recognizer for the word devaasaarakhyaalaa is devaa + saarakhyaa + laa. Morphological Parser outputs per morpheme analysis of the word using the morphemes recognized by the Morphological Recognizer. 3 Linguistic Resources The linguistic resources required by the morphological analyzer include a lexicon and inflection rules for all paradigms. 3.1 Lexicon entry in lexicon consists of a tuple The the category of the the parain retrieving the inflection rules associated with it. Our lexicon contains in all 24035 roots belonging to different categories. 28 3.2 Inflection Rules Inflection rules specify the inflectional suffixes to be inserted (or deleted) to (or from) different positions in the root to get its inflected form. An rule has the format: morphosyntactic features, features the set of morphosyntactic features associated with the inflectional form obtained by applying the given inflection rule. Following is the exhaustive list of morphosyntactic features to which different morphemes get inflected:</abstract>

It is used by the Morphological Recognizer. 4 Category Wise Morphological Formulation The grammatical categories observed in Marathi include nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, interjections and postpositions. The morphemes belonging to different categories undergo different treatment. 4.1 Noun Morphology Marathi nouns inflect for number and case. Postpositions get attached to the oblique forms of the nouns (known as stems) to show their relationship with other words in the sentence. A single stem is used for the attachment of all postpositions which makes nominal morphology economic in nature. For example various forms of the word {daara} (door) are (to the door), {daaraane} (by the door), {daaraashejarii} (besides the door). Please note that the same stem {daaraa} is used for the attachment of various postpositions. Depending upon their ending, gender and the inflectional patterns, the nouns in Marathi can be classified into various paradigms. A paradigm is a complete set of related inflectional forms associated with a given root. All words that share the similar inflectional forms fall in same paradigm. Table 1 presents the paradigm {daara} (door). Case Direct Oblique Number Singular {daa- {daaraa} ra} Plural {daare} {daaraaN} Table 1. Paradigm Table for {daara} (door) {kaapaDa} (cloth), {paana} (leaf), (book), {kapaaTa} (cupboard) are the few nouns that fall into this paradigm. Every paradigm has a set of inflection rules associated with it one corresponding to every inflectional form of the word. A noun has four inflectional forms each one corresponding to a case-number pair. Hence, every paradigm has four inflectional rules associated with it. An inflectional rule for Marathi consists of a tuple specifying the inflectional suffixes that should be inserted and deleted from ultimate and penultimate position of the root. Table 2 lists the inflectional suffixes that collectively form an inflectional rule. The procedure to obtain the inflected form of the given root R belonging to paradigm P by applying the inflectional rule I &lt;UD, UI, PUD, PUI&gt; is as follows: i. R =R - PUD ii. R = R + PUI R = R iv. R = R + UI Suffix Description Ultimate Deletion Suffix to be deleted from the ul-timate position of the root 29 (UD) Ultimate Insertion (UI) to be inserted at the ultimate position of the root Penultimate Deletion (PUD) Suffix to be deleted from the pe-nultimate position of the root Penultimate Insertion (PUI) to be inserted at the ultimate position of the root Table 2. Suffixes in an Inflectional Rule For a given word, even if a single rule out of the four is different from the set of available paraa new paradigm needs to be created. Ta- 3 shows the paradigm {bhakta} (devotee). Note that, the only difference between the two paradigm tables is in the direct case plural form. Case Direct Oblique Number Singular {bhakta} {bhaktaa} Plural {bhakta} {bhaktaaN} Table 3. Paradigm Table for {bhakta} (devotee) In this way, our lexicon contains 16448 nouns categorized into 76 paradigms. Out of the 76 paradigms, 30 correspond to feminine gender, 29 to masculine and 17 to neuter gender. This set of paradigms includes three null paradigms, one corresponding to each gender. In modern Marathi, the stem of the proper nouns or foreign words transliterated in Marathi is same as the root. In short, postpositions can be directly attached to these roots without any modification. Such nouns belong to the null paradigm. 4.2 Postposition Morphology Postpositions follow the stems of nouns and pronouns. Postpositions in Marathi can be broadly classified into case markers and shabdayogi avyayas. Shabdayogi avyayas show the relationship of nouns and pronouns with the other words in the sentence while deriving the adjectives or adverbs in most of the cases. Depending upon the category of the word derived by they are classified as adjectival and adver- Class Ordering Rules Ex-ample Case markers They can follow any ob-lique form. No other suffixes can follow them. (by) Adjectival Suffixes They can follow an obli-que form of a root. Since they derive an adjective, they can be followed by any other suffixes. {saa-rak-haa} (alike Possessive case It can follow any oblique form. It can be followed by any other suffixes. {chaa} (the one belong ing to some-thing) marker Closing suffixes They can follow any ob-lique form. No other suffixes can follow them. {pek-shaa} (in-stead of) {chaa} It can follow Peculiar {chaa} (the one) adjectival suffix NSTs and Nearly closing postpositions. It can followed by case markers. Peculiar They can follow any obbial suffixes respectively. We have 142 postpositions listed in our lexicon. 4.3 Classification of Postpositions The first step towards defining the morphotactics of a language is the classification of various suffixes into classes depending upon the morphemes they can follow and the morphemes that can follow them. Given the list of 142 postpositions, we carefully examined each one to understand its morphotactic behavior and came up with the classification of Marathi postpositions as presented in the Table 4. 30 NSTs lique form. They can be followed only by Exclu- {ja-waLa} (near) sive postpositions and {chaa} adjectival suffix. Exclusive postpositions They can follow peculiar {ii} NSTs. They close (in-side) word. Nearly closing postpositions They can follow of nouns and nouns. They can be followed by {chaa} adjectival suffix. ryanta} (uptil) gi avyayas They can follow almost (only) any morpheme oblique forms of nouns. They can be followed by some postpositions. But, this behavior is quite irregular and needs more investigation. In most of the cases, these suffixes close the word. Hence, we consider them to be occurring only at the end of the word. Table 4. Classification of Postpositions 4.4 Verbs The verbs inflect for gender, number and person of the subject and the direct object in a sentence. They also inflect for tense and aspect of the action as well as mood of the speaker in an illocutionary act. They may even undergo derivation. Further discussion on verbal morphology will be based on Aakhyaata theory (inflection) and Krudanta theory (derivation) (Damale, 1970). Our lexicon contains 1160 verb roots classified into 22 paradigms. Theory the basis of inflection in Marathi. refers to tense, aspect, and mood. Aakhyaata is realized through an aakhyaata suffix which is a closing suffix, attached to the verb root. There are 8 types of aakhyaatas named after the phonemic shape of the aakhyaata suffix. Associated with every aakhyaata are various aakhyaataarthas which indicate the features: tense, aspect and mood. An aakhyaata may or may not agree with gender. There are around 80 Aakhyaata suffixes in Marathi. Theory the basis of verbal derivation in Marathi. Krudanta refers to the word ending in a krut-pratyaya (a suffix which refers to an action). Krut-pratyayas are attached at the end of verbs to form noninfinitive verb forms. These forms usually belong to one of the categories: noun, adverb or adjective. They contribute to the aspect of the verb from which they are derived. We cover only the krudanta forms which are regular in behavior. Verbs: verbs in Marathi have different behavior as compared to the other verbs (regular verbs). These verbs are present in some inflected forms for which no definite stem exists. 4.5 Adjectives Marathi adjectives can be classified into two categories: ones that do not inflect and others that inflect for gender, number and case where such an inflection agrees with the gender and number of the noun modified by them. The inflectional forms of the adjectives are generated using similar procedure as that of nouns. 4.6 Pronouns There are nine types of pronouns in Marathi. Pronouns possess very irregular behavior resulting into a large number of suppletive forms. In addition to these forms every pronoun has a specific oblique form (one each for singular and plural) to which shabdayogi avyayas can be attached. 4.7 Indeclinable Words Adverbs, conjunctions and interjections are the indeclinable words. Some adverbs can be followed by a subset of postpositions. 5 Morphotactics and Automata Along with the postpositions mentioned in the Table 4 the complete set of morphemes in Marathi includes the roots and their inflectional forms. Every morpheme is labeled according to the class it belongs to. These labels are used to the that models 31 Figure 2. Morphotactic FSM rathi language.

Different applications are interested in different bit of information provided by the analyzer like the stem, the root, the suffixes or the morphosyntactic features. Hence, the performance evaluation of a morphological analyzer has to be observed in terms of its impact on the performance of the applications that use it. Hence, we carry out the in two parts: In evaluation directly measure the accuracy of morphological on the given data. In evaluawe observe the improvement in the performances of statistical pos tagger and chunker http://www.ims.unistuttgart.de/projekte/gramotron/SOFTWARE/SFST.html 32 by using the morphological analyzer to generate the morphological features that help in boosting their accuracies. We used the corpora in TOUR- ISM and NEWS domain for all our experiments. 6.1 Direct Evaluation We used Marathi Morphological Analyzer for the analysis of 21096 unique words. We manually measured the accuracy of the morphological analyzer by counting the number of correctly analyzed words out of the total number of words. In the cases where a word has multiple analyses, the word was counted as correctly analyzed only when all of the correct analyses are present. Note that, in order to emphasize more the usefulness of our morphological analysis of Marathi, we added most of the roots used in the corpus to the lexicon before starting the experiments. For a language like Marathi, it is required to build a very rich lexicon which can be done over a larger period of time. Out of the 21096 unique words, 20503 (97.18%) were found to be correctly analyzed. Of the remaining 593 words, 394 words could not be recognized by Morphological Recognizer and 199 words were assigned the incorrect or insufficient analyses. By taking a closer look at the 394 words which were not recognized (segmented) we could come up with the causes of recognition</abstract>

In most of the cases, these suffixes close the word. Hence, we consider them to be occurring only at the end of the word. Table 4. Classification of Postpositions 4.4 Verbs The verbs inflect for gender, number and person of the subject and the direct object in a sentence. They also inflect for tense and aspect of the action as well as mood of the speaker in an illocutionary act. They may even undergo derivation. Further discussion on verbal morphology will be based on Aakhyaata theory (inflection) and Krudanta theory (derivation) (Damale, 1970). Our lexicon contains 1160 verb roots classified into 22 paradigms. Aakhyaata Theory forms the basis of verbal inflection in Marathi. Aakhyaata refers to tense, aspect, and mood. Aakhyaata is realized through an aakhyaata suffix which is a closing suffix, attached to the verb root. There are 8 types of aakhyaatas named after the phonemic shape of the aakhyaata suffix. Associated with every aakhyaata are various aakhyaataarthas which indicate the features: tense, aspect and mood. An aakhyaata may or may not agree with gender. There are around 80 Aakhyaata suffixes in Marathi. Krudanta Theory f</context>

<context position="4247" citStr="Dixit et al. (2006)" startWordPosition="640" endWordPosition="643"> Bharati et al. (2004) propose a paradigm based algorithm for morphological analysis of Hindi, an inflecting language. In Hindi, the inflected forms of roots do not allow further attachment of any other suffixes. In contrast, in Marathi once the root is transformed into its inflected form it is followed by suffixes to show its agreement with the other words in the sentence. Some postpositions derive new words which themselves may undergo inflection and allow attachment of other suffixes. This makes the simple paradigm-based model proposed in this work unfit for Marathi morphological analysis. Dixit et al. (2006) developed a morphological analyzer with a purpose of using it for spell checking. Though their analyzer successfully analyzes the words with a single suffix, its scope is restricted to the handling of only first level suffixes. 1.1 Our Approach In this paper, we present the morphological analyzer for Marathi which is official language of the state of Maharashtra (India). With 90 million fluent speakers worldwide, Marathi ranks as the 4th most spoken language in India and the 15th most in the world. The methodology is based on the use of paradigm-based inflectional system combined with finite </context>

Section 7 briefs on the experimental setup and the results. 27 Figure 1. Architecture of Marathi Morphological Analyzer 2 Morphological Analyzer for Marathi The formation of polymorphemic words leads to complexities which need to be handled during the analysis process. FSMs prove to be elegant and computationally efficient tools for modeling the suffix ordering in such words. However, the recursive process of word formation in Marathi involves inflection at the time of attachment of every new suffix. The FSMs need to be capable of handling them. Koskenniemi (1983) suggests the use of separate FSMs to model the orthographic changes. But, Marathi has a well devised system of paradigms to handle them. One of our observations led us to a solution that combines paradigm-based inflectional system with FSM for modeling. The observation was that, during the ith recursion only (i-1)th morpheme changes its form which can be handled by suitably modifying the FSM. The formation of the same word devaasaarakhyaalaa described above can be viewed as illustrated in Equation 2. Equation 2.
