In a manuscript William Labov (1987)
states that although linguistics is a field
with a long historical tradition and with
a high degree of consensus on basic cat-
egories, it experiences a fundamental de-
vision concerning the role that quantita-
tive methods should play as part of the
research progress. Linguists differ in the
role they assign to the use of natural lan-
guage examples in linguistic research and
in the publication of its results. In this pa-
per we suggest that the general availabil-
ity of richly annotated, multi-lingual data
directly suited for scientific publications
could have a positive impact on the way
we think about language, and how we ap-
proach linguistics.We encourage the sys-
tematic generation of linguistic data be-
yond what emerges from fieldwork and
other descriptive studies and introduce an
online glossing tool for textual data anno-
tation. We argue that the availability of
such an online tool will facilitate the gen-
eration of in-depth annotated linguistic ex-
amples as part of linguistic research. This
in turn will allow the build-up of linguis-
tic resources which can be used indepen-
dent of the research focus and of the the-
oretical framework applied. The tool we
would like to present is a non-expert-user
system designed in particular for the work
with lesser documented languages. It has
been used for the documentation of several
African languages, and has served for two
projects involving universities in Africa.

The role that digital tools play in all fields of mod-

partially due to the success of computational lin-
guistics and its involvement in fields such as lex-
icography, corpus linguistics and syntactic pars-
ing, to just name some. Most crucially however
this development is due to the success of IT in
general and in particular to the World Wide Web
which has created new standards also for linguis-
tic research. Through the internet our perception
of ’data’ and publication of linguistic results has
changed drastically only in a matter of a few years.
Although the development of language resources
and language technology for African languages is
increasing steadily, the digital revolution and the
resources and possibilities it offers to linguistics
are mostly seized by researchers in the First World
connected to work centering around the key lan-
guages. For this paper we would like to con-
ceive of this situation in terms of lost opportuni-
ties: At present formal linguistics and linguistic
research conducted on Third World languages are
mostly undertaken with very little knowledge of
each other and hardly any exchange of research
results. Likewise, language documentation, which
has roots in language typology and computational
linguistics, only partially coincides with work in
African linguistics. Yet, it is evident that the
general availability of linguistic material from a
bigger sample of languages will eventually not
only affect the way in which we think about lan-
guage, but also might have an impact on linguistic
methodology and on the way we go about linguis-
tic research. If you are only a few mouse clicks
away from showing that a certain generalization
only holds for a limited set of languages, but truly
fails to describe a given phenomenon for a wider
sample, statements claiming linguistic generality
have to be phrased much more carefully. Our per-
ception of the nature of language could truly ben-
efit from general access to representative multi-
lingual data. It therefore would seem a linguistic
goal in itself to (a) work towards a more general

<bodyText confidence="0.999977054054054">
It is well known that the generation of natural lan-
guage examples enriched by linguistic informa-
tion in the form of symbols is a time consuming
enterprise quite independent of the form that the
raw material has and the tools that were chosen.
Equally well known are problems connected to
the generation and storage of linguistic data in the
form of standard document files or spread sheets
(Bird and Simons 2003). Although it is generally
agreed on that linguistic resources must be kept in
a sustainable and portable format, it remains less
clear, how a tool should look that would help the
linguist to accomplish these goals. For the individ-
ual researcher it is not easy to decide which of the
available tools serve his purpose best. To start with
it is often not clear which direction research will
take, which categories of data are needed and in
which form the material should be organized and
stored. But perhaps even more importantly most
tools turn out to be so complex that the goal of
mastering them becomes an issue in its own right.
Researchers that work together with communities
that speak an endangered or lesser documented
language experience that digital tools used for lan-
guage documentation can be technically too de-
manding.Training periods for annotators become
necessary together with technical help and main-
tenance by experts which not necessarily are lin-
guists themselves. In this way tool management
develops into an issue in itself taking away re-
sources from the original task at hand - the lin-
guistic analysis.Linguists too often experience that
some unlucky decision concerning technical tools
gets data locked in systems which cannot be ac-
cessed anymore after a project, and the technical
support coming along with it,has run out of fund-
ing.

2.1 TypeCraft an overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999513965517241">
In the following we would like to introduce a lin-
guistic tool for text annotation called TypeCraft,
which we have created through combining several
well-understood tools of knowledge management.
Needless to say, TypeCraft will not solve all the
problems mentioned above, yet it has some new
features that make data annotation an easier task
while adding discernibility and general efficiency.
That one can import example sentences directly
into research papers is one of these features. In
addition TypeCraft is a collaboration and knowl-
edge sharing tool, and, combined with database
functionality, it offers some of the most important
functions we expect to see in a digital language
documentation tool.
In the following we will address glossing and il-
lustrate present day glossing standards with exam-
ples from Akan, a Kwa language spoken in Ghana,
to then turn to a more detailed description of Type-
Craft. However, a brief overview over the main
features of TypeCraft seems in order at this point.
TypeCraft is a relational database for natural
language text combined with a tabular text editor
for interlinearized glossing, wrapped into a wiki
which is used as a collaborative tool and for on-
line publication. The system, which has at present
50 users and a repository of approximately 4000
annotated phrases, is still young. Table 1 gives a
first overview of TypeCraft’s main functionalities.

3 Glossing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925875">
The use of glosses in the representation of primary
data became a standard for linguistic publications
as late as in the 1980s (Lehmann, 2004) where
interlinear glosses for sample sentences started
to be required for all language examples except
those coming from English. However, the use of
glossed examples in written research was, and still
is, not accompanied by a common understanding
of its function, neither concerning its role in re-
search papers nor its role in research itself. It
seems that glosses, when occurring in publica-
tions, are mostly seen as a convenience to the
reader. Quite commonly information essential to
the understanding of examples is given in sur-
rounding prose, and often without any appropriate
reflection in the glosses themselves.
Let us look at a couple of examples with in-
terlinear glosses taken at random from the list
of texts containing Akan examples. These ex-
amples are taken from the online database Odin
at Fresno State University. The Odin database
(http:/www.csufresno.edu/odin/) is a repository of
interlinear glossed texts which have been extracted
mainly from linguistic papers. The database it-

and the forth one comes from a manuscript by
(Drubig, 2000) who writes about focus construc-
tions:

’Who is it that Ama is looking for?’
Except for Ameka, the authors quote Akan ex-
amples which are excerpted from the linguistic lit-
erature. Often examples coming from African lan-
guages have a long citation history and their val-
idation is in most cases nearly impossible. When
we compare (1) – (4) we notice a certain incon-
sistency for the annotation of n´o which is glossed
as ’the’ (1), ’that’ (3) and as DEF (2) respec-
tively. This difference could indicate that Akan
does not make a lexical distinction between defi-
niteness and deixis, most likely however we sim-
ply observe a ’glossing figment’. The general lack
of part of speech information in all examples eas-
ily leads us astray; should we for example assume
that na in example (4) is a relative pronoun? The
general lack of proper word level glossing makes
the data for other linguists quite useless, in par-
ticular if they are not themselves native speakers
or experts in exactly this language.M`a`a is a past
form, but that tense marking is derived by suffixa-
tion is only indicated in (2) via a hyphen between
the translational gloss and the PAST tag. Like-
wise rehwehwein(4)is a progressive form, yet the
lack of morpheme boundaries, and consistent an-
notation prevents that these and similarly glossed
serve as a general linguistic resource. Purely trans-
lational glosses might be adequate for text strings
which serve as mere illustrations; however, for lin-
guistic data,that is those examples that are (a) ei-
ther crucial for the evaluation of the theoretical
developxment reported on, or (b) portray linguis-
tic pattern of general interest, to provide morpho-

syntactic and morpho-functional as well as part of
speech information would seem best practice.
It seems that linguists underestimate the role
that glossing, if done properly,could play as part of
linguist research. Symbolic rewriting and formal-
grammar development are two distinct modes of
linguistic research. Yet there is no verdict that
forces us to express descriptive generalizations ex-
clusively by evoking a formal apparatus of consid-
erable depth. Instead given simplicity and parsi-
mony of expression it might well be that symbolic
rewriting serves better for some research purposes
than theoretical modeling. One can not replace
one by the other. Yet which form of linguistic
rendering is the best in a given situation should
be a matter of methodological choice. Essential
is that we realize that we have a choice. Sizing
the opportunity that lies in the application of sym-
bolic rewriting, of which interlinear glossing is
one form, could make us realize that the genera-
tion of true linguistic resources is not exclusively
a matter best left to computational linguists.

4 A short description of TypeCraft
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999876461538462">
Typecraft is an interlinear ’glosser’ designed for
the annotation of natural language phrases and
small corpora. The TypeCraft wiki serves as an
access point to the TypeCraft database. We use
standard wiki functionality to direct the TypeCraft
user from the index page of the TypeCraft wiki to
the TC interface of the database, called My Texts.
My Texts is illustrated in Figure 1.The interface
is taken from a user that not only possesses pri-
vate data (Own texts), but who also shares data
with other users (Shared Texts). At present shar-
ing of text is a feature set by the database admin-
istrator, but in the near future the user will be able
to choose from the TypeCraft user list the peo-
ple with whom he wants to share his data. Note
that data is stored as texts which consist of anno-
tated tokens, standardly sentences. ’Text’ in Type-
Craft does not necessarily entail coherent text, but
may also refer to any collection of individual to-
kens that the user has grouped together. A Type-
Craft user can publish his data online; yet his own
texts are by default ’private’, that is, only he as the
owner of the material can see the data and change
it. To share data within the system or online is a
function that can be selected by the user.
Different from Toolbox, which is a linguistic
data management system known to many African-
ists, TypeCraft is a relational database and there-
fore by nature has many advantages over file
based systems like Toolbox. This concerns both,
data integrity and data migration. In addition
databases in general offer a greater flexibility for
data search.For example, it is not only possible
to extract all serial verb constructions for all (or
some) languages known to TypeCraft, it is also
possible to use the gloss index to find all se-
rial verb constructions where a verb receives a
marking specific to the second verb in an SVC.
The other mayor difference between Toolbox and
TypeCraft is that TypeCraft is an online system
which brings many advantages, but also some dis-
advantages. An online database is a multi-user
system, that is, many people can access the same
data at the same time independent of were they
physically are. Distributive applications are effi-
cient tools for international research collaboration.
TypeCraft is designed to allow data sharing and
collaboration during the process of annotation. Yet
although there are many advantages to an online
tool, to be only online is at the same time a major
disadvantage. Not all linguists work with a stable
internet connection, and in particular for work in
the field TypeCraft is not suitable.
TypeCraft uses Unicode, so that every script
that the user can produce on his or her PC can
be entered into the browser,1 which for Type-
Craft must be Mozilla Firefox. Different from
Toolbox TypeCraft insists on a set of linguistic
glosses, reflecting standards advocated for exam-
ple by the Leipzig Convention distributed by the
Max Planck Institute for Evaluationary Anthro-
pology or an initiative such a GOLD (Farrar and
Lewis, 2005).Yet, TypeCraft still allows a user-
driven flexibility when it comes to the extension
of the tag-set, as explained in the next section.

<bodyText confidence="0.999751777777778">
TypeCraft supports word-to-word glossing on
eight tiers as shown in Figure 2. After having
imported a text and run it through the sentence
splitter, a process that we will not describe here,
the user can select via mouse click one of the
phrases and enter the annotation mode. The sys-
tem prompts the user for the Lazy Annotation
Mode (in Toolbox called sentence parsing) which
will automatically insert (on a first choice ba-

sis) the annotation of already known words into
the annotation table. TypeCraft distinguishes be-
tween translational, functional and part-of-speech
glosses. They are visible to the annotator as dis-
tinct tiers called Meaning, Gloss and POS. Ev-
ery TypeCraft phrase, which can be either a lin-
guistic phrase or a sentence, is accompanied by
a free translation. In addition the specification
of construction parameters is possible. Although
the user is restricted to a set of pre-defined tags,
the TypeCraft glossery is negogiable. User dis-
cussion on the TCwiki, for example in the context
of project work, or by individual users, has led to
an extension of the TypeCraft tag set. Although
TypeCraft endorses standardization, the system is
user-driven. Glosses are often rooted in traditional
grammatical terminology, which we would like
to set in relation to modern linguistic terminol-
ogy. The TCwiki is an adaquate forum to discuss
these traditions and to arrive at a annotation stan-
dard which is supported by the users of the sys-
tem. Under annotation the user has access a drop-
down menu, showing standard annotation sym-
bols. These symbols together with short explana-
tions can also be accessed from the TypeCraft wiki
so that they can be kept open in tabs during annota-
tion. In Figure 2 we also see the effect of ’mousing
over’ symbols, which displays their ’long-names’.
Some symbols have been ordered in classes. In
Figure 2 we see for example that the feature past
is a subtype of the feature Tense. This classifica-
tion will in the future also inform search. Further
features of the annotation interface that we cannot
describe here are the easy representation of non-
Latin scripts, deletion and insertion of words and
morphemes during annotation, the accessibility of
several phrases under annotation and the grouping
of tokens into texts.

6 Data Migration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999245">
Export of data to the main text editors is one of
the central functions of TypeCraft. TC tokens can
be exported to Microsoft Word, OpenOffice.org
Writer and LaTeX. This way the user can store his
data in a database, and when the need arises, he
can integrate it into his research papers. Although
annotating in TypeCraft is time consuming, even
in Lazy Annotation Mode, the resusablity of data
stored in TypeCraft will on the long run pay off.
Export can be selected from the text editing win-
dow or from the SEARCH interface.After import
the examples can still be edited in case small ajust-
ments are necessery.Example (5) is an example ex-
ported from TypeCraft.

ceptually more appropriate, linguistic publications
require a more condensed format. As for now we
have decided on an export which displays 6 tiers.
Next to export to the main editors, TypeCraft al-
lows XML export which allows the exchange of
data with other applications. Figure 3 gives an
overview over the top 15 languages in TypeCraft.
In January 2009 Lule Sami with 2497 phrases
and Runyakitara (Runyankore Rukiga)with 439

In this paper we suggest that the general availabil-

linguists to gloss their data without having to learn
how to install software and without having to un-
dergo a long training period before the can use
the tool and (b) to make linguistically annotated

Not all linguists work with a stable internet connection, and in particular for work in the field TypeCraft is not suitable. TypeCraft uses Unicode, so that every script that the user can produce on his or her PC can be entered into the browser,1 which for TypeCraft must be Mozilla Firefox. Different from Toolbox TypeCraft insists on a set of linguistic glosses, reflecting standards advocated for example by the Leipzig Convention distributed by the Max Planck Institute for Evaluationary Anthropology or an initiative such a GOLD (Farrar and Lewis, 2005).Yet, TypeCraft still allows a userdriven flexibility when it comes to the extension of the tag-set, as explained in the next section. 5 Glossing with TypeCraft TypeCraft supports word-to-word glossing on eight tiers as shown in Figure 2. After having imported a text and run it through the sentence splitter, a process that we will not describe here, the user can select via mouse click one of the phrases and enter the annotation mode. The system prompts the user for the Lazy Annotation Mode (in Toolbox called sentence parsing) which will automatically insert (on a first choice ba1Note however t</context>

TypeCraft is a relational database for natural language text combined with a tabular text editor for interlinearized glossing, wrapped into a wiki which is used as a collaborative tool and for online publication. The system, which has at present 50 users and a repository of approximately 4000 annotated phrases, is still young. Table 1 gives a first overview of TypeCraft’s main functionalities. 3 Glossing The use of glosses in the representation of primary data became a standard for linguistic publications as late as in the 1980s (Lehmann, 2004) where interlinear glosses for sample sentences started to be required for all language examples except those coming from English. However, the use of glossed examples in written research was, and still is, not accompanied by a common understanding of its function, neither concerning its role in research papers nor its role in research itself. It seems that glosses, when occurring in publications, are mostly seen as a convenience to the reader. Quite commonly information essential to the understanding of examples is given in surrounding prose, and often without any appropriate reflection in th</context>
