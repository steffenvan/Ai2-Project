Previous comparisons of document and
query translation suffered difficulty due to
differing quality of machine translation in
these two opposite directions. We avoid
this difficulty by training identical statistical
translation models for both translation di-
rections using the same training data. We in-
vestigate information retrieval between En-
glish and French, incorporating both trans-
lations directions into both document trans-
lation and query translation-based informa-
tion retrieval, as well as into hybrid sys-
tems. We find that hybrids of document
and query translation-based systems out-
perform query translation systems, even
human-quality query translation systems.

Should we translate the documents or the
queries in cross-language information re-
trieval? The question is more subtle than
the implied two alternatives. The need for
translation has itself been. questioned : al-
though non-translation based methods of
cross-language information retrieval (C LIR),
such as cognate-matching (Buckley et al.,
1998) and cross-language Latent Semantic
Indexing (Dumais et al., 1997) have been
developed, the most common approaches
have involved coupling information retrieval
(IR) with machine translation (MT). (For
convenience, we refer to dictionary-lookup
techniques and interlingua (Diekema et al.,
1999) as &amp;quot;translation&amp;quot; even if these tech-
niques make no attempt to produce coherent
or sensibly-ordered language; this distinction
is important in other areas, but a stream
of words is adequate for IR.) Translating
the documents into the query&apos;s language(s)
and translating the queries into the docu-
ment&apos;s language(s) represent two extreme
approaches to coupling MT and IR. These
two approaches are neither equivalent nor
mutually exclusive. They are not equivalent
because machine translation is not an invert-
ible operation. Query translation and doc-
ument translation become equivalent only if
each word in one language is translated into
a unique word in the other languages. In fact
machine translation tends to be a many-to-
one mapping in the sense that finer shades
of meaner are distinguishable in the original
text than in the translated text. This effect
is readily observed, for example, by machine
translating the translated text back into the
original language. These two approaches are
not mutually exclusive, either. We find that
a hybrid approach combining both directions
of translation produces superior performance
than either direction alone. Thus our answer
to the question posed by the title is both.
Several arguments suggest that document
translation should be competitive or supe-
rior to query translation. First, MT is
error-prone. Typical queries are short and
may contain key words and phrases only
once. When these are translated inappro-
priately, the IR engine has no chance to
recover. Translating a long document of-
fers the MT engine many more opportuni-
ties to translate key words and phrases. If
only some of these are translated appropri-
ately, the IR engine has at least a chance
of matching these to query terms. The sec-
ond argument is that the tendency of MT

<bodyText confidence="0.999189640449439">
engines to produce fewer distinct words than
were contained in the original document (the
output vocabulary is smaller than the in-
put vocabulary) also indicates that machine
translation should preferably be applied to
the documents. Note the types of prepro-
cessing in use by many monolingual IR en-
gines: stemming (or morphological analysis)
of documents and queries reduces the num-
ber of distinct words in the document index,
while query expansion techniques increase
the number of distinct words in the query.
Query translation is probably the most
common approach to CUR. Since MT is fre-
quently computationally expensive and the
document sets in IR are large, query transla-
tion requires fewer computer resources than
document translation. Indeed, it has been
asserted that document translation is sim-
ply impractical for large-scale retrieval prob-
lems (Carbonell et al., 1997), or that doc-
ument translation will only become practi-
cal in the future as computer speeds im-
prove. In fact, we have developed fast MT
algorithms (McCarley and Roukos, 1998) ex-
pressly designed for translating large col-
lections of documents and queries in IR.
Additionally, we have used them success-
fully on the TREC CUR task (Franz et
al., 1999). Commercially available MT sys-
tems have also been used in large-scale doc-
ument translation experiments (Oard and
Hackett, 1998). Previously, large-scale at-
tempts to compare query translation and
document translation approaches to CUR
(Oard, 1998) have suggested that document
translation is preferable, but the results have
been difficult to interpret. Note that in order
to compare query translation and document
translation, two different translation systems
must be involved. For example, if queries are
in English and document are in French, then
the query translation IR system must incor-
porate English French translation, whereas
the document translation IR system must
incorporate French= English. Since famil-
iar commercial MT systems are &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot;
systems, the quality of translation is not
known a priori. The present work avoids
this difficulty by using statistical machine
translation systems for both directions that
are trained on the same training data us-
ing identical procedures. Our study of doc-
ument translation is the largest comparative
study of document and query translation of
which we are currently aware. We also inves-
tigate both query and document translation
for both translation directions within a lan-
guage pair.
We built and compared three information
retrieval systems : one based on document
translation, one based on query translation,
and a hybrid system that used both trans-
lation directions. In fact, the &amp;quot;score&amp;quot; of a
document in the hybrid system is simply the
arithmetic mean of its scores in the query
and document translation systems. We find
that the hybrid system outperforms either
one alone. Many different hybrid systems
are possible because of a tradeoff between
computer resources and translation quality.
Given finite computer resources and a col-
lection of documents much larger than the
collection of queries, it might make sense
to invest more computational resources into
higher-quality query translation. We inves-
tigate this possibility in its limiting case: the
quality of human translation exceeds that
of MT; thus monolingual retrieval (queries
and documents in the same language) rep-
resents the ultimate limit of query transla-
tion. Surprisingly, we find that the hybrid
system involving fast document translation
and monolingual retrieval continues to out-
perform monolingual retrieval. We thus con-
clude that the hybrid system of query and
document translation will outperform a pure
query translation system no matter how high
the quality of the query translation.

The algorithm for fast translation, which
has been described previously in some de-
tail (McCarley and Roukos, 1998) and used
with considerable success in TREC (Franz
et al., 1999), is a descendent of IBM Model
1 (Brown et al., 1993). Our model captures
important features of more complex models,
such as fertility (the number of French words

tortion parameters that are unimportant for
IR. Very fast decoding is achieved by imple-
menting it as a direct-channel model rather
than as a source-channel model. The ba-
sic structure of the EnglishFrench model
is the probability distribution

of the fertility n, of an English word ei and a
set of French words fi...fnt associated with
that English word, given its context. Here
we regard the context of a word as the pre-
ceding and following non-stop words; our ap-
proach can easily be extended to other types
of contextual features. This model is trained
on approximately 5 million sentence pairs of
Hansard (Canadian parliamentary) and UN
proceedings which have been aligned on a
sentence-by-sentence basis by the methods
of (Brown et al., 1991), and then further
aligned on a word-by-word basis by meth-
ods similar to (Brown et al., 1993). The
FrenchEnglish model can be described by
simply interchanging English and French no-
tation above. It is trained separately on the
same training data, using identical proce-
dures.

3 Information Retrieval
Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965348484848">
The document sets used in our experiments
were the English and French parts of the doc-
ument set used in the TREC-6 and TREC-
7 CUR tracks. The English document
set consisted of 3 years of AP newswire
(1988-1990), comprising 242918 stories orig-
inally occupying 759 MB. The French doc-
ument set consisted of the same 3 years of
SDA (a Swiss newswire service), compris-
ing 141656 stories and originally occupy-
ing 257 MB. Identical query sets and ap-
propriate relevance judgments were available
in both English and French. The 22 top-
ics from TREC-6 were originally constructed
in English and translated by humans into
French. The 28 topics from TREC-7 were
originally constructed (7 each from four dif-
ferent sites) in English, French, German, and
Italian, and human translated into all four
languages. We have no knowledge of which
TREC-7 queries were originally constructed
in which language. The queries contain three
SGML fields (&lt;topic&gt;, &lt;description&gt;,
&lt;narrat ive&gt;), which allows us to con-
trast short (&lt;descript ion&gt; field only) and
long (all three fields) forms of the queries.
Queries from TREC-7 appear to be some-
what &amp;quot;easier&amp;quot; than queries from TREC-6,
across both document sets. This difference
is not accounted for simply by the number of
relevant documents, since there were consid-
erably fewer relevant French documents per
TREC-7 query than per TREC-6 query.
With this set of resources, we performed
the two different sets of CUR experiments,
denoted EqFd (English queries retrieving
French documents), and FqEd (French
queries retrieving English documents.) In
both EqFd and FqEd we employed both
techniques (translating the queries, trans-
lating the documents). We emphasize
that the query translation in EqFd was
performed with the same EnglishFrench
translation system as the document transla-
tion in FqEd, and that the document trans-
lation EqFd was performed with the same
FrenchEnglish translation system as the
query translation in FqEd. We further em-
phasize that both translation systems were
built from the same training data, and thus
are as close to identical quality as can likely
be attained. Note also that the results
presented are not the TREC-7 CLIR task,
which involved both cross-language informa-
tion retrieval and the merging of documents
retrieved from sources in different languages.
Preprocessing of documents includes part-
of-speech tagging and morphological anal-
ysis. (The training data for the transla-
tion models was preprocessed identically, so
that the translation models translated be-
tween morphological root words rather than
between words.) Our information retrieval
systems consists of first pass scoring with
the Okapi formula (Robertson et al., 1995)
on unigrams and symmetrized bigrams (with

en, des, de, and - allowed as connectors) fol-
lowed by a second pass re-scoring using local
context analysis (LCA) as a query expan-
sion technique (Xu and Croft, 1996). Our
primary basis for comparison of the results
of the experiments was TREC-style average
precision after the second pass, although we
have checked that our principal conclusions
follow on the basis of first pass scores, and
on the precision at rank 20. In the query
translation experiments, our implementation
of query expansion corresponds to the post-
translation expansion of (Ballasteros and
Croft, 1997), (Ballasteros and Croft, 1998).
All adjustable parameters in the IR sys-
tem were left unchanged from their values
in our TREC ad-hoc experiments (Chan et
al., 1997),(Franz and Roukos, 1998), (Franz
et al., 1999) or cited papers (Xu and Croft,
1996), except for the number of documents
used as the basis for the LCA, which was
estimated at 15 from scaling considerations.
Average precision for both query and docu-
ment translation were noted to be insensitive
to this parameter (as previously observed in
other contexts) and not to favor one or the
other method of CUR.

4 Results

<bodyText confidence="0.999973728571429">
In experiment EqFd, document translation
outperformed query translation, as seen in
columns qt and dt of Table 1. In experiment
FqEd, query translation outperformed doc-
ument translation, as seen in the columns
qt and dt of Table 2. The relative perfor-
mances of query and document translation,
in terms of average precision, do not differ
between long and short forms of the queries,
contrary to expectations that query transla-
tion might fair better on longer queries. A
more sophisticated translation model, incor-
porating more nonlocal features into its def-
inition of context might reveal a difference
in this aspect. A simple explanation is that
in both experiments, FrenchEnglish trans-
lation outperformed EnglishFrench trans-
lation. It is surprising that the difference
in performance is this large, given that the
training of the translation systems was iden-
tical. Reasons for this difference could be
in the structure of the languages themselves;
for example, the French tendency to use
phrases such as pomme de terre for potato
may hinder retrieval based on the Okapi for-
mula, which tends to emphasize matching
unigrams. However, separate monolingual
retrieval experiments indicate that the ad-
vantages gained by indexing bigrams in the
French documents were not only too small
to account for the difference between the re-
trieval experiments involving opposite trans-
lation directions, but were in fact smaller
than the gains made by indexing bigrams
in the English documents. The fact that
French is a more highly inflected language
than English is unlikely to account for the
difference since both translation systems and
the IR system used morphologically ana-
lyzed text. Differences in the quality of pre-
processing steps in each language, such as
tagging and morphing, are more difficult to
account for, in the absence of standard met-
rics for these tasks. However, we believe
that differences in preprocessing for each lan-
guage have only a small effect on retrieval
performance. Furthermore, these differences
are likely to be compensated for by the train-
ing of the translation algorithm: since its
training data was preprocessed identically,
a translation engine trained to produce lan-
guage in a particular style of morphing is
well suited for matching translated docu-
ments with queries morphed in the same
style. A related concern is &amp;quot;matching&amp;quot; be-
tween translation model training data and
retrieval set - the English AP documents
might have been more similar to the Hansard
than the Swiss SDA documents. All of these
concerns heighten the importance of study-
ing both translation directions within the
language pair.
On a query-by-query basis, the scores are
quite correlated, as seen in Fig. (1). On
TREC-7 short queries, the average preci-
sions of query and document translation are
within 0.1 of each other on 23 of the 28
queries, on both FqEd and EqFd. The re-
maining outlier points tend to be accounted
for by simple translation errors, (e.g. vol

d&apos;oeuvres d&apos;art flight art on the TREC-
7 query CL.036.) With the limited number
of queries available, it is not clear whether
the difference in retrieval results between the
two translation directions is a result of small
effects across many queries, or is principally
determined by the few outlier points.
We remind the reader that the query
translation and document translation ap-
proaches to CUR are not symmetrical. In-
formation is distorted in a different manner
by the two approaches, and thus a combi-
nation of the two approaches may yield new
information. We have investigated this as-
pect by developing a hybrid system in which
the score of each document is the mean of its
(normalized) scores from both the query and
document translation experiments. (A more
general linear combination would perhaps be
more suitable if the average precision of the
two retrievals differed substantially.) We ob-
serve that the hybrid systems which combine
query translation and document translation
outperform both query translation and doc-
ument translation individually, on both sets
of documents. (See column qt + dt of Tables
1 and 2.)
Given the tradeoff between computer re-
sources and quality of translation, some
would propose that correspondingly more
computational effort should be put into
query translation. From this point of view,
a document translation system based on fast
MT should be compared with a query trans-
lation system based on higher quality, but
slower MT. We can meaningfully investigate
this limit by regarding the human-translated
versions of the TREC queries as the ex-
treme high-quality limit of machine trans-
lation. In this task, monolingual retrieval
(the usual baseline for judging the degree
to which translation degrades retrieval per-
formance in CUR) can be regarded as the
extreme high-quality limit of query trans-

lation. Nevertheless, document translation
provides another source of information, since
the context sensitive aspects of the transla-
tion account for context in a manner distinct
from current algorithms of information re-
trieval. Thus we do a further set of experi-
ments in which we mix document translation
and monolingual retrieval. Surprisingly, we
find that the hybrid system outperforms the
pure monolingual system. (See columns ht
and ht di of Tables 1 and 2.) Thus we
conclude that a mixture of document trans-
lation and query translation can be expected
to outperform pure query translation, even
very high quality query translation.

5 Conclusions and Future
Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992324324324">
We have performed experiments to compare
query and document translation-based CUR
systems using statistical translation models
that are trained identically for both trans-
lation directions. Our study is the largest
comparative study of document translation
and query translation of which we are aware;
furthermore we have contrasted query and
document translation systems on both direc-
tions within a language pair. We find no
clear advantage for either the query trans-
lation system or the document translation
system; instead FrenchEnglish translation
appears advantageous over English French
translation, in spite of identical procedures
used in constructing both. However a hy-
brid system incorporating both directions
of translation outperforms either. Further-
more, by incorporating human query trans-
lations rather than machine translations,
we show that the hybrid system contin-
ues to outperform query translation. We
have based our conclusions by comparing
TREC-style average precisions of retrieval
with a two-pass IR system; the same con-
clusions follow if we instead compare preci-
sions at rank 20 or average precisions from
first pass (Okapi) scores. Thus we conclude
that even in the limit of extremely high qual-
ity query translation, it will remain advan-
tageous to incorporate both document and
query translation into a CUR system. Fu-
ture work will involve investigating trans-
lation direction differences in retrieval per-
formance for other language pairs, and for
statistical translation systems trained from
comparable, rather than parallel corpora.

<abstract confidence="0.999775117647059">Previous comparisons of document and query translation suffered difficulty due to differing quality of machine translation in these two opposite directions. We avoid this difficulty by training identical statistical translation models for both translation directions using the same training data. We investigate information retrieval between English and French, incorporating both translations directions into both document translation and query translation-based information retrieval, as well as into hybrid systems. We find that hybrids of document and query translation-based systems outperform query translation systems, even human-quality query translation systems.</abstract>

Indeed, it has been asserted that document translation is simply impractical for large-scale retrieval problems (Carbonell et al., 1997), or that document translation will only become practical in the future as computer speeds improve.

In fact, we have developed fast MT algorithms (McCarley and Roukos, 1998) expressly designed for translating large collections of documents and queries in IR. Additionally, we have used them successfully on the TREC CUR task (Franz et al., 1999). Commercially available MT systems have also been used in large-scale document translation experiments (Oard and Hackett, 1998). Previously, large-scale attempts to compare query translation and document translation approaches to CUR (Oard, 1998) have suggested that document translation is preferable, but the results have been difficult to interpret. Note that in order to compare query translation and document translation, two different translation systems must be involved. For example, if queries are in English and document are in French, then the query translation IR system must incorporate English French translation, whereas the document translation IR system must incorporate French= English. Since familiar commercial MT systems are &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; systems, the quality of translation is not known a priori. The present work avoids this </context>

Note also that the results presented are not the TREC-7 CLIR task, which involved both cross-language information retrieval and the merging of documents retrieved from sources in different languages. Preprocessing of documents includes partof-speech tagging and morphological analysis. (The training data for the translation models was preprocessed identically, so that the translation models translated between morphological root words rather than between words.) Our information retrieval systems consists of first pass scoring with the Okapi formula (Robertson et al., 1995) on unigrams and symmetrized bigrams (with 210 en, des, de, and - allowed as connectors) followed by a second pass re-scoring using local context analysis (LCA) as a query expansion technique (Xu and Croft, 1996). Our primary basis for comparison of the results of the experiments was TREC-style average precision after the second pass, although we have checked that our principal conclusions follow on the basis of first pass scores, and on the precision at rank 20. In the query translation experiments, our implementation of query expansion corresponds to the posttranslation expansion of (Ballast</context>
