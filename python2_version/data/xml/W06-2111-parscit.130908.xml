This paper deals with the prepositions
which introduce an adjunct of duration,
such as the English for and in. On
the basis of both crosslingual and mono-
lingual evidence these adjuncts are ar-
gued to be ambiguous between a float-
ing and an anchored interpretation. To
capture the distinction in formal terms I
employ the framework of HEAD-DRIVEN
PHRASE STRUCTURE GRAMMAR, en-
riched with a number of devices which are
familiar from DISCOURSE REPRESENTA-
TION THEORY. The resulting analysis
is demonstrated to be relevant for ma-
chine translation, natural language gener-
ation and natural language understanding.

1 A typology of PP adjuncts of duration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9957875">
In many languages the adjuncts of duration take
different forms depending on the aspectual class
of the VP which they modify. In English, for in-
stance, they are introduced by for if the VP de-
notes a state or a process and by in if the VP de-
notes an accomplishment.

The adjuncts in (1) and (3) unambiguously
specify the duration of Maria’s activity of playing
the piano and of Laura’s stay in Ohio. The adjunct
in (4), however, triggers an ambiguity: it can de-
note any three-year period in the past in which the
state of Silvia’s living in Paris held, but it can also
denote a period which started three years ago and
which includes the time of utterance (Kamp and
Reyle, 1993, 567). The relevance of this distinc-
tion is clear from the fact that there are languages
which use different prepositions for both interpre-
tations. Italian, for instance, employs the preposi-
tion per in the translation of (1), (3) and the first
interpretation of (4), whereas it employs da in the
translation of the second interpretation of (4).

For ease of reference I will call the adjuncts in
(1), (3), (4a), (5), (6) and (7) floating: they denote
a stretch of time whose position on the time line is
not defined. The adjuncts in (4b) and (8), by con-
trast, will be called anchored, since their position
on the time line is fixed: their right boundary is
supplied by the time of utterance. As illustrated in
(9-10), the right boundary can also be supplied by
a temporal adjunct, such as a PP[a] or a subordi-
nate S[quando].

In (2) and (11) the PP[in] adjuncts are unam-
biguously floating, but (12) is ambiguous: it can
either mean that it will take Leo one hour to tune
your piano or that he will start the activity of tun-
ing your piano in an hour from now. In the first
interpretation, the adjunct is floating, as in (2)
and (11), but in the second one it is anchored:
the beginning of the hour which will pass be-
fore Leo starts tuning the piano is supplied by the
time of utterance. The relevance of the distinction
is, again, brought out by the Italian equivalents.
While the floating PP adjuncts are introduced by
in, as in the translation of (2), (11) and (12a), the
anchored ones are introduced by fra, as in the tans-
lation of (12b).1

The distinction between floating and anchored
adjuncts is relevant for Machine Translation and
for Natural Language Generation, since it condi-
tions the choice of the preposition. At the same
time, it is also relevant for Natural Language Un-
derstanding, since it bears on the issue of scope.
More specifically, while the floating adjuncts can
be in the scope of a VP quantifier, the anchored
ones cannot.
&apos;Instead of fra one also finds tra. The choice is mainly
conditioned by phonological factors. To avoid alliteration
speakers tend to prefer fra when (one of) the surrounding
words start with t(r), and tra when (one of) the surrounding
words start with f(r).
‘Lea has lived in Rome for three years.’
The PP[per] in (17) is in the scope of the quan-
tifying spesso ‘often’: there are several one hour
periods of my playing the flute. By contrast the
PP[da] in (18) outscopes the quantifying sempre
‘always’, yielding an interpretation in which Lea’s
living in Rome is said to go on uninterruptedly for
a period of three years. The same contrast can be
observed in sentences with VP negation.

The floating PP[per] in (19) is in the scope of
the negation, yielding an interpretation which can
be paraphrased as ‘it is not the case that (s)he
played the flute for an hour’. The anchored PP[da]
in (20), by contrast, outscopes the negation, yield-
ing an interpretation which can be paraphrased as
‘for an hour it has not been the case that (s)he plays
the piano’.
To capture the semantic properties of the four
types of durational adjuncts we need a framework
for the analysis and representation of temporal ex-
pressions. As a starting point, I will use the HPSG
framework, as defined in (Pollard and Sag, 1994)
and (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000). This suffices to
spell out what the four types have in common (sec-
tion 2), but in order to also model what differen-
tiates them (section 4) we will need some exten-
sions to the standard HPSG ontology and notation
(section 3).
2 What the durational adjuncts have in
common
Since the adjuncts of duration are modifiers rather
than arguments, they are not selected by their head
sister. Instead, it is the head which is selected by
the adjunct. Phrased in terms of the HPSG no-
tation, a PP adjunct has a SELECT feature whose

<bodyText confidence="0.999901454545455">
Since the SELECT feature is part of the HEAD
value, it is shared between the PP and the preposi-
tion. From this it follows that prepositions which
introduce an adjunct can impose constraints on the
SYNSEM value of the phrase which the adjunct
modifies. Exploiting this possibility we can cap-
ture the syntactic properties of the prepositions
which introduce a durational adjunct in terms of
the following AVM.3
In words, the prepositions which introduce a
durational adjunct take an NP complement and
project a PP which modifies a VP. Besides these
properties, which they share with many other types
of PP adjuncts, there is the more specific require-
ment that the NP complement must denote an
amount of time. This is modeled in terms of its
MARK(ING) and its CONTENT values. Starting
with the latter and employing the semantic ontol-
ogy of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), in which the
CONTENT value of a nominal is an object of type
scope-object, the relevant constraint can be de-
fined as follows:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9559405">
2For reasons which are given in (Van Eynde, 2005), I do
not employ separate selection features for the modifiers and
the specifiers. The SELECT attribute, hence, generalizes over
the MOD(IFIED) and SPEC(IFIED) attributes of (Pollard and
Sag, 1994).
3I ignore the distinction between local and non-local prop-
erties. CAT is, hence, short for LOCALCATEGORY and CON-
TENT for LOCALCONTENT.

In words, the index of the complement must be
the argument of a predicate of type t-unit-rel. This
is one of the intermediate types in the hierarchy
of relations. Its subtypes are the predicates which
express temporal units.

The defining property of temporal units is that
they succeed one another without interruption. A
day, for instance, is a temporal unit, since it is im-
mediately followed by another day, but a Friday
is not, since it is not immediately followed by an-
other Friday. The relevance of this distinction is
illustrated by the fact that for a day and in ten
minutes can be adjuncts of duration, whereas for
Friday and in April cannot. Whether a PP[for/in]
can be used as an adjunct of duration is not only
determined by the semantic class of the noun, but
also by the prenominals: for every day and in that
month, for instance, cannot be used as adjuncts of
duration. This is captured by the constraint that the
NP must be indefinite, rather than universal or de-
terminate. Evidence for making this threefold dis-
tinction and for modeling it in terms of the MARK-
ING values is provided in (Van Eynde, 2005).4
A crucial factor in the semantic analysis of
the durational adjuncts is their contribution to the
meaning of the VP: the amount of time which is
denoted by their NP daughter must somehow be
related to the semantic properties of the VPs which
they modify. To spell this out we first need a for-
mat for the semantic analysis of verbal objects.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.559795">
4If the NP is determinate, as in for the last five years, for
the whole morning and da lunedi ‘since Monday’, it does not
denote an amount of time, but an interval or an instant. Such
PPs have meanings which resemble those of the durational
adjuncts, but their contribution to the semantics of the VP is
nonetheless different.

3 Times and temporal objects
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998081">
To model the semantic properties of verbal projec-
tions I extend the semantic ontology of (Ginzburg
and Sag, 2000) with times and temporal objects.

<bodyText confidence="0.999837909090909">
The temporal objects belong to a subtype of
scope-object and, hence, have an index and a set
of restrictions on that index. Besides, they have a
TIMES attribute, which takes a list of times as its
value.
The objects of type time denote temporal en-
tities and come in two kinds: instants and inter-
vals. This distinction does not concern any inher-
ent properties of the temporal entities, but rather
their mode of individuation. The objects of type
interval have a beginning, an end and a duration.

<bodyText confidence="0.99847175">
Since the value of the EXTENT feature is of type
scope-obj it can be identified with the amount of
time which is expressed in an adjunct of duration.
Of the various times which figure in the list of
a temporal object, the rightmost one has a special
role, since it is the one which is linked to the index
of the verb. For ease of reference I will call it the
V-time.

The verb’s index () is comparable to a David-
sonian event variable, but has a slightly different
role. It is, for instance, not only assigned to verbs
and VPs which denote an event, but to all verbal
projections, including the stative ones. The in-
dex is invariably the first argument of the relation
which the verb denotes, as in greet-rel (i, x, y),
and is linked to the V-time by means of the loc-
rel relation. The function of this relation is to link
the denotation of the V(P) to the time at which it
holds. It is comparable to the overlap relation, fa-
miliar from Discourse Representation Theory:
t.
Since the temporal objects belong to a subtype
of scope-obj, it follows that their indices are of the
same type as those of the nominal objects. Given
the ontology of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), this im-
plies that they contain features for person, number
and gender.5

<bodyText confidence="0.999922454545454">
The presence of these features in the CONTENT
values of verbs may, at first, seem awkward, since
they model properties which are typical of N(P)s.
A form like greets, for instance, requires its NP
subject to have a third person singular index, but
does not have a third person singular index of its
own, as argued in (Pollard and Sag, 1994, 82).
Looking closer, though, the assignment of these
features to verbs does have a number of advan-
tages. One is that it accounts for the agreement
in clauses with a verbal subject.

(29) To make mistakes is/*are/*am human.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999800444444444">
Since the form is requires a subject with a third
person singular index, it follows that the nonfinite
VPs in (28) and (29) have a third person singu-
lar index, and since phrases share their index with
their head daughter, this implies in turn that the
verbs forging and make have a third person singu-
lar index.6 To avoid misunderstanding, it is worth
stressing that this does not mean that they require
a third person singular subject, but rather that they
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.902780555555555">
5The values of these features concern the mode of indiv-
duation of a nominal’s referent and should not be confused
with properties of the referent itself. A person, for instance,
can be individuated by means of a second person pronoun,
but this does not mean that (s)he has the property of being a
second person.
6Thatforging and make are verbs is clear from the fact that
they take NP complements; if they were nouns, they would
take PP[ofJ complements.

themselves are third person singular. This distinc-
tion is especially relevant for the finite verbs, as
illustrated by (30) and (31).

<bodyText confidence="0.999738829787234">
Also here the subjects are required to have a
third person singular index, and since they are
clauses which are headed by a finite verb, it fol-
lows that the finite verbs have a third person sin-
gular index. Moreover, this index is different from
the one of their subject. Snore in (31), for instance,
has a third person singular index, but requires its
subject to have an index which is plural or non-
third person. In sum, one advantage of the assign-
ment of a third person singular index to verbs is
that it accounts in a straightforward manner for the
agreement data in (28-31).
Another advantage is that the indices provide a
way to capture the distinction between the aspec-
tual classes (Aktionsarten). To see this, let us first
revisit the role of the indices in nominal objects.
As argued in (Pollard and Sag, 1994), the indices
are not only useful to model agreement between a
finite verb and its subject, or between an anaphoric
pronoun and its antecedent, but also between a de-
terminer and its nominal head. The demonstra-
tive these, for instance, requires a nominal with a
plural index, whereas this requires a nominal with
a singular index. A similar constraint holds for
the combination of a quantifying determiner and
its head. While every and a require their nomi-
nal head to be singular and count, much requires
it to be singular and mass: every/a/*much table
vs. much/*every/*a traffic. Despite the obvious
similarity with the constraints for the demonstra-
tive determiners, they cannot be modeled in terms
of the indices of (Pollard and Sag, 1994), since
their indices do not contain any information about
the mass/count distinction. A natural move, there-
fore, is to redefine the indices in such a way that
this distinction can be integrated. Independent evi-
dence for this move is provided by the fact that the
mass/count distinction concerns the mode of indi-
viduation of the referent(s) of the nominal, rather
than an inherent property of the referent(s), see
footnote 5. Another piece of evidence is the fact
that the mass/count distinction closely interacts
with the NUMBER distinction: most of the relevant
constraints simultaneously concern a number and
a mass/count value. To model this I add a COUNT-
ABILITY feature to the objects of type number,
adopting a proposal of (Van Eynde, 2005).

(32)number
COUNTABILITY countability
Its values are:
countability
bounded unbounded
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999302838709678">
In terms of this dichotomy the count nouns have
bounded indices, whereas the mass nouns have un-
bounded indices. Nouns which are used either
way, such as glass, have the underspecified value
in their lexical entry; this can be resolved by the
addition of a determiner, as in a glass or much
glass.
Returning now to the verbs, it automatically fol-
lows from the presence of an index in their CON-
TENT values that they also have a COUNTABIL-
ITY feature. This is an advantage, since it pro-
vides us with the means to spell out the similari-
ties between the count/mass distinction for nomi-
nals and the Aktionsart distinction for verbal pro-
jections. The states and processes, for instance,
share the property of the mass nouns that their de-
notation is unbounded, whereas the accomplish-
ments and the achievements share the property of
the count nouns that their denotation is bounded
(Bach, 1986). Exploiting the potential of this ex-
tended role of the indices I introduce a distinc-
tion between two types of temporal objects. The
bounded ones have an index of type bounded and
are subsumed by the following constraint:
In words, the index of a bounded temporal ob-
ject is temporally included in the V-time. Since
inclusion is a special type of overlap, this is a
more constrained version of (26). It corresponds
to DRT’s ‘e t’.
The unbounded temporal objects obviously
have an index of type unbounded, but the relation

of this index to the corresponding time is not sub-
ject to any further constraints; it is subsumed by
the generic loc-rel.
With the introduction of times, temporal objects
and the boundedness distinction we have paved the
way for a more detailed analysis of the various
types of durational adjuncts.
4 What differentiates the four types of
durational adjuncts
I first discuss the adjuncts which combine with an
unbounded temporal object, and then the adjuncts
which combine with a bounded temporal object.
In the last paragraph I return to the issue of scope.

4.1 The PP[for/per/da] adjuncts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999846318181818">
The PP[for/per/da] adjuncts select a VP which de-
notes an unbounded temporal object and specify
the duration of the V-time.7
The restricton to unbounded temporal objects
accounts for the fact that these adjuncts combine
with states and processes, but not with accom-
plishments or achievements. Notice, though, that
this restriction does not exclude the combination
with VPs whose CONTENT value is the underspec-
ified temp(oral)-obj(ect). This is important, since
few V(P)s are inherently bounded or unbounded.
It is usually by the addition of an adjunct that the
underspecification gets resolved.
That the adjunct specifies the duration of the V-
time is illustrated by the examples of the first sec-
tion. In (1), for instance, it is the time of playing
the piano which is said to take an hour, and in (3) it
is the time of Laura’s stay in Ohio which is said to
have a length of two months. The relation between
this time and the index of the V(P) is required to
be the one of inclusion (s t). This accounts for
the fact that (1) is only true if the playing of the

piano went on for at least an hour. The generic
loc-rel is not sufficient for this purpose, since it
only requires overlap: it would make (1) true if
the playing went on for five minutes.
For the floating PP[for] and PP[per] adjuncts
there is nothing which need be added to (34).
Their anchored counterparts, however, are sub-
sumed by one further constraint.8

In words, the interval whose duration is speci-
fied has a right boundary () which is related to
the time of utterance. This relation can be the one
of identity, as in (5b) and (8), or it can be medi-
ated by a temporal adjunct. In (9), for instance,
the right boundary is specified by the PP a quel
punto, which precedes the time of utterance, and
in (10) it is specified by the clause quando verr`a
raggiunta da Ivo, which follows the time of utter-
ance. To capture this variation I use the relation
temp-rel. This stands for any binary relation be-
tween times.9

4.2 The PP[in/fra/tra] adjuncts of duration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983644444444444">
The floating PP[in] adjuncts select a VP which de-
notes a bounded temporal object and specify the
duration of the V-time.
Since only intervals can have duration this con-
straint accounts for the fact that these adjuncts are
not compatible with VPs which denote instanta-
neous events, as in:
(32) ? The bomb exploded in two minutes.
In contrast to their floating counterparts, the
anchored PP[in] and PP[tra/fra] adjuncts do not
specify the duration of the V-time, but rather of
the interval which elapses between the time of ut-
terance and the beginning of the V-time. In terms
of Allen’s ontology, this can be characterized as an
instance of m(eets)-rel: m(x, y) is true if and only
if x immediately precedes y.10
(39) The bomb will explode in two minutes.
Since the beginning of an interval necessarily
precedes its end, the V-time ( ) must follow the
time of utterance. This accounts for the fact that
the English PP[in] can have the anchored interpre-
tation in a clause with a future auxiliary, such as
(12) and (39), or in a clause with a futurate present
tense, such as we are leaving in a minute, but not
in a clause with a past tense verb, such as (2), or
in a clause with a non-futurate present tense, such
as (11).

Having spelled out the properties of the anchored
adjuncts we can now account for the fact that they
cannot be outscoped by a VP quantifier. What
makes this impossibe is the fact that the interval
whose duration they specify is linked to the time
of utterance. The link can be more or less direct,
but it does not allow for the intrusion of other in-
tervening intervals. The floating adjuncts, by con-
trast, apply to intervals which are not linked to the
time of utterance and, therefore, allow the intru-
sion of intervening times, as in (17), where spesso
‘often’ outscopes per un’ ora ‘for an hour’.
Of course, the fact that the floating adjuncts
can be outscoped by a VP quantifier does not im-
ply that they must be outscoped whenever there is
such a quantifier. To show this let us have a look
at (40).

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964444444445">
The adjuncts of duration require an analysis in
terms of two mutually independent distinctions.
One concerns the aspectual class of the modi-
fied VP and is widely acknowledged as relevant.
The other concerns the distinction between float-
ing and anchored interpretations and is often ig-
nored; its relevance, though, is clear from both
crosslingual and monolingual data. For the anal-
ysis of the four types of durational adjuncts I have
employed an extended version of HPSG. The ex-
tensions mainly concern the addition of times and
temporal objects to the semantic ontology and the
notation. The resulting analysis captures both the
similarities and the differences between the four
types of adjuncts, and provides an account for the
fact that the floating adjuncts can be outscoped by
a VP quantifier, whereas the anchored ones can-
not.

<author confidence="0.999972">Frank Van_Eynde</author>
<abstract confidence="0.994131876332624">This paper deals with the prepositions which introduce an adjunct of duration, as the English On the basis of both crosslingual and monolingual evidence these adjuncts are argued to be ambiguous between a floating and an anchored interpretation. To capture the distinction in formal terms I the framework of enriched with a number of devices which are from The resulting analysis is demonstrated to be relevant for machine translation, natural language generation and natural language understanding. 1 A typology of PP adjuncts of duration In many languages the adjuncts of duration take different forms depending on the aspectual class of the VP which they modify. In English, for inthey are introduced by the VP dea state or a process and by the VP denotes an accomplishment. (1) Maria played the piano for an hour. (2) Anna wrote that letter in half an hour. Orthogonal to this distinction, there is another one, which can be made explicit by comparing (1) and (3) with (4). (3) Laura will stay in Ohio for two months. (4) Silvia has lived in Paris for three years. The adjuncts in (1) and (3) unambiguously specify the duration of Maria’s activity of playing the piano and of Laura’s stay in Ohio. The adjunct in (4), however, triggers an ambiguity: it can denote any three-year period in the past in which the state of Silvia’s living in Paris held, but it can also denote a period which started three years ago and which includes the time of utterance (Kamp and Reyle, 1993, 567). The relevance of this distinction is clear from the fact that there are languages which use different prepositions for both interpretations. Italian, for instance, employs the preposithe translation of (1), (3) and the first of (4), whereas it employs the translation of the second interpretation of (4). (5) Maria suon`o il pianoforte per un’ora. (6) Laura staraper due mesi nell’Ohio. (7) Silvia ha abitato per tre anni a Parigi. (8) Silvia abita a Parigi da tre anni. For ease of reference I will call the adjuncts in (3), (4a), (5), (6) and (7) they denote a stretch of time whose position on the time line is not defined. The adjuncts in (4b) and (8), by conwill be called since their position on the time line is fixed: their right boundary is supplied by the time of utterance. As illustrated in (9-10), the right boundary can also be supplied by temporal adjunct, such as a or a subordi- (9) A at quel that punto point Silvia Silvia abitava lived da for tre three anni years a in Parigi.

Association for Computational Linguistics 73 suonavo I-played il the flauto flute ora. hour per for un’ an The distinction between floating and anchored is also relevant for the adjuncts. To show this let us compare (2) and (11) with (12). (17) Spesso often ‘I often played the flute for an hour.’ (11) Pablo makes such a drawing in less than five minutes. (18) Lea Lea sempre always Roma Rome abita lives a in da for tre three anni. years (12) Leo will tune your piano in an hour. (2) and (11) the adjuncts are unambiguously floating, but (12) is ambiguous: it can either mean that it will take Leo one hour to tune your piano or that he will start the activity of tuning your piano in an hour from now. In the first interpretation, the adjunct is floating, as in (2) and (11), but in the second one it is anchored: the beginning of the hour which will pass before Leo starts tuning the piano is supplied by the time of utterance. The relevance of the distinction is, again, brought out by the Italian equivalents. While the floating PP adjuncts are introduced by as in the translation of (2), (11) and (12a), the ones are introduced by as in the tansof (13) Anna ha scritto quella lettera in mezz’ora. (14) Pablo fa un disegno come quello in meno di cinque minuti. (15) Leo accorder`a il tuo pianoforte in un’ora. (16) Leo accorder`a il tuo pianoforte fra un’ora.

At the same time, it is also relevant for Natural Language Understanding, since it bears on the issue of scope. More specifically, while the floating adjuncts can be in the scope of a VP quantifier, the anchored ones cannot. of also finds The choice is mainly conditioned by phonological factors. To avoid alliteration tend to prefer (one of) the surrounding start with and (one of) the surrounding start with ‘Lea has lived in Rome for three years.’ in (17) is in the scope of the quanthere are several one hour periods of my playing the flute. By contrast the in (18) outscopes the quantifying ‘always’, yielding an interpretation in which Lea’s living in Rome is said to go on uninterruptedly for a period of three years. The same contrast can be observed in sentences with VP negation. suon`o played ‘(S)he did not play the flute for an hour.’ pianoforte piano ‘(S)he has not been playing the piano for an hour now.’ floating in (19) is in the scope of the negation, yielding an interpretation which can be paraphrased as ‘it is not the case that (s)he the flute for an hour’. The anchored in (20), by contrast, outscopes the negation, yielding an interpretation which can be paraphrased as ‘for an hour it has not been the case that (s)he plays the piano’. To capture the semantic properties of the four types of durational adjuncts we need a framework for the analysis and representation of temporal expressions. As a starting point, I will use the HPSG framework, as defined in (Pollard and Sag, 1994) and (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000). This suffices to spell out what the four types have in common (section 2), but in order to also model what differentiates them (section 4) we will need some extensions to the standard HPSG ontology and notation (section 3). 2 What the durational adjuncts have in common Since the adjuncts of duration are modifiers rather than arguments, they are not selected by their head sister. Instead, it is the head which is selected by the adjunct. Phrased in terms of the HPSG noa PP adjunct has a whose (19) Non not il the flauto flute per for un’ an ora. hour (20) Non suona plays il the not da for ora. hour un’ an 74 value spells out the syntactic and semantic properof its head COMPS the is part of the value, it is shared between the PP and the preposition. From this it follows that prepositions which introduce an adjunct can impose constraints on the of the phrase which the adjunct modifies. Exploiting this possibility we can capture the syntactic properties of the prepositions which introduce a durational adjunct in terms of following In words, the prepositions which introduce a durational adjunct take an NP complement and project a PP which modifies a VP. Besides these properties, which they share with many other types of PP adjuncts, there is the more specific requirement that the NP complement must denote an amount of time. This is modeled in terms of its and its Starting with the latter and employing the semantic ontology of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), in which the of a nominal is an object of type the relevant constraint can be defined as follows: reasons which are given in (Van Eynde, 2005), I do not employ separate selection features for the modifiers and specifiers. The hence, generalizes over and attributes of (Pollard and Sag, 1994). ignore the distinction between local and non-local prophence, short for t-unit-rel INST In words, the index of the complement must be argument of a predicate of type This is one of the intermediate types in the hierarchy of relations. Its subtypes are the predicates which express temporal units. sem-object rel t-unit-rel day-rel year-rel ... The defining property of temporal units is that they succeed one another without interruption. A day, for instance, is a temporal unit, since it is immediately followed by another day, but a Friday is not, since it is not immediately followed by another Friday. The relevance of this distinction is by the fact that a day ten be adjuncts of duration, whereas April Whether a can be used as an adjunct of duration is not only determined by the semantic class of the noun, but by the prenominals: every day that for instance, cannot be used as adjuncts of duration. This is captured by the constraint that the NP must be indefinite, rather than universal or determinate. Evidence for making this threefold disand for modeling it in terms of the is provided in (Van Eynde, A crucial factor in the semantic analysis of the durational adjuncts is their contribution to the meaning of the VP: the amount of time which is denoted by their NP daughter must somehow be related to the semantic properties of the VPs which they modify. To spell this out we first need a format for the semantic analysis of verbal objects. the NP is determinate, as in the last five whole morning lunedi Monday’, it does not denote an amount of time, but an interval or an instant. Such PPs have meanings which resemble those of the durational adjuncts, but their contribution to the semantics of the VP is nonetheless different. prep SELECTCAT COMPS HEAD COMPS COMPS CAT (22) (21) RESTR loc-rel ... 75 3 Times and temporal objects To model the semantic properties of verbal projections I extend the semantic ontology of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000) with times and temporal objects. sem-object scope-object temp-obj ... The temporal objects belong to a subtype of hence, have an index and a set of restrictions on that index. Besides, they have a which takes a list of times as its value. objects of type temporal entities and come in two kinds: instants and intervals. This distinction does not concern any inherent properties of the temporal entities, but rather their mode of individuation. The objects of type a beginning, an end and a duration. the value of the is of type can be identified with the amount of time which is expressed in an adjunct of duration. Of the various times which figure in the list of a temporal object, the rightmost one has a special role, since it is the one which is linked to the index of the verb. For ease of reference I will call it the V-time. temp-obj loc-rel RESTRINST TIME time The verb’s index () is comparable to a Davidsonian event variable, but has a slightly different role. It is, for instance, not only assigned to verbs and VPs which denote an event, but to all verbal projections, including the stative ones. The index is invariably the first argument of the relation the verb denotes, as in x, is linked to the V-time by means of the loc- The function of this relation is to link the denotation of the V(P) to the time at which it holds. It is comparable to the overlap relation, familiar from Discourse Representation Theory: t. Since the temporal objects belong to a subtype it follows that their indices are of the same type as those of the nominal objects. Given the ontology of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), this implies that they contain features for person, number index presence of these features in the values of verbs may, at first, seem awkward, since they model properties which are typical of N(P)s. form like for instance, requires its NP subject to have a third person singular index, but does not have a third person singular index of its own, as argued in (Pollard and Sag, 1994, 82). Looking closer, though, the assignment of these features to verbs does have a number of advantages. One is that it accounts for the agreement in clauses with a verbal subject. (28) Forging banknotes is/*are/*am not easy. (29) To make mistakes is/*are/*am human. the form a subject with a third person singular index, it follows that the nonfinite VPs in (28) and (29) have a third person singular index, and since phrases share their index with their head daughter, this implies in turn that the a third person singu- To avoid misunderstanding, it is worth stressing that this does not mean that they require a third person singular subject, but rather that they values of these features concern the mode of indivduation of a nominal’s referent and should not be confused with properties of the referent itself. A person, for instance, can be individuated by means of a second person pronoun, but this does not mean that (s)he has the property of being a second person. verbs is clear from the fact that they take NP complements; if they were nouns, they would complements. time interval instant (26) (27) 76 themselves are third person singular. This distinction is especially relevant for the finite verbs, as illustrated by (30) and (31). (30) That he/she snores is/*are/*am annoying. (31) That I/they snore is/*are/*am annoying. Also here the subjects are required to have a third person singular index, and since they are clauses which are headed by a finite verb, it follows that the finite verbs have a third person singular index. Moreover, this index is different from one of their subject. (31), for instance, has a third person singular index, but requires its subject to have an index which is plural or nonthird person. In sum, one advantage of the assignment of a third person singular index to verbs is that it accounts in a straightforward manner for the agreement data in (28-31). Another advantage is that the indices provide a way to capture the distinction between the aspectual classes (Aktionsarten). To see this, let us first revisit the role of the indices in nominal objects. As argued in (Pollard and Sag, 1994), the indices are not only useful to model agreement between a finite verb and its subject, or between an anaphoric pronoun and its antecedent, but also between a determiner and its nominal head. The demonstrafor instance, requires a nominal with a index, whereas a nominal with a singular index. A similar constraint holds for the combination of a quantifying determiner and head. While their nomihead to be singular and count, to be singular and mass: table Despite the obvious similarity with the constraints for the demonstrative determiners, they cannot be modeled in terms of the indices of (Pollard and Sag, 1994), since their indices do not contain any information about the mass/count distinction. A natural move, therefore, is to redefine the indices in such a way that this distinction can be integrated. Independent evidence for this move is provided by the fact that the mass/count distinction concerns the mode of individuation of the referent(s) of the nominal, rather than an inherent property of the referent(s), see footnote 5. Another piece of evidence is the fact that the mass/count distinction closely interacts the most of the relevant constraints simultaneously concern a number and mass/count value. To model this I add a to the objects of type adopting a proposal of (Van Eynde, 2005). Its values are: countability bounded unbounded In terms of this dichotomy the count nouns have bounded indices, whereas the mass nouns have unbounded indices. Nouns which are used either such as have the underspecified value in their lexical entry; this can be resolved by the of a determiner, as in glass Returning now to the verbs, it automatically folfrom the presence of an index in their that they also have a This is an advantage, since it provides us with the means to spell out the similarities between the count/mass distinction for nominals and the Aktionsart distinction for verbal projections. The states and processes, for instance, share the property of the mass nouns that their denotation is unbounded, whereas the accomplishments and the achievements share the property of the count nouns that their denotation is bounded (Bach, 1986). Exploiting the potential of this extended role of the indices I introduce a distinction between two types of temporal objects. The ones have an index of type are subsumed by the following constraint: In words, the index of a bounded temporal object is temporally included in the V-time. Since inclusion is a special type of overlap, this is a more constrained version of (26). It corresponds to DRT’s ‘e t’.

The temporal objects belong to a subtype of scope-object and, hence, have an index and a set of restrictions on that index. Besides, they have a TIMES attribute, which takes a list of times as its value. The objects of type time denote temporal entities and come in two kinds: instants and intervals. This distinction does not concern any inherent properties of the temporal entities, but rather their mode of individuation. The objects of type interval have a beginning, an end and a duration.

The index is invariably the first argument of the relation which the verb denotes, as in greet-rel (i, x, y), and is linked to the V-time by means of the locrel relation. The function of this relation is to link the denotation of the V(P) to the time at which it holds. It is comparable to the overlap relation, familiar from Discourse Representation Theory: t. Since the temporal objects belong to a subtype of scope-obj, it follows that their indices are of the same type as those of the nominal objects. Given the ontology of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), this implies that they contain features for person, number and gender.5 index PERSON person NUMBER number GENDER gender The presence of these features in the CONTENT values of verbs may, at first, seem awkward, since they model properties which are typical of N(P)s. A form like greets, for instance, requires its NP subject to have a third person singular index, but does not have a third person singular index of its own, as argued in (Pollard and Sag, 1994, 82).

Orthogonal to this distinction, there is another one, which can be made explicit by comparing (1) and (3) with (4). (3) Laura will stay in Ohio for two months. (4) Silvia has lived in Paris for three years. The adjuncts in (1) and (3) unambiguously specify the duration of Maria’s activity of playing the piano and of Laura’s stay in Ohio. The adjunct in (4), however, triggers an ambiguity: it can denote any three-year period in the past in which the state of Silvia’s living in Paris held, but it can also denote a period which started three years ago and which includes the time of utterance (Kamp and Reyle, 1993, 567). The relevance of this distinction is clear from the fact that there are languages which use different prepositions for both interpretations. Italian, for instance, employs the preposition per in the translation of (1), (3) and the first interpretation of (4), whereas it employs da in the translation of the second interpretation of (4).

The anchored PP[da] in (20), by contrast, outscopes the negation, yielding an interpretation which can be paraphrased as ‘for an hour it has not been the case that (s)he plays the piano’. To capture the semantic properties of the four types of durational adjuncts we need a framework for the analysis and representation of temporal expressions. As a starting point, I will use the HPSG framework, as defined in (Pollard and Sag, 1994) and (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000). This suffices to spell out what the four types have in common (section 2), but in order to also model what differentiates them (section 4) we will need some extensions to the standard HPSG ontology and notation (section 3). 2 What the durational adjuncts have in common Since the adjuncts of duration are modifiers rather than arguments, they are not selected by their head sister. Instead, it is the head which is selected by the adjunct. Phrased in terms of the HPSG notation, a PP adjunct has a SELECT feature whose (19) Non not il flauto per un’ ora. the flute for </context>

This is modeled in terms of its MARK(ING) and its CONTENT values. Starting with the latter and employing the semantic ontology of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), in which the CONTENT value of a nominal is an object of type scope-object, the relevant constraint can be defined as follows: 2For reasons which are given in (Van Eynde, 2005), I do not employ separate selection features for the modifiers and the specifiers. The SELECT attribute, hence, generalizes over the MOD(IFIED) and SPEC(IFIED) attributes of (Pollard and Sag, 1994). 3I ignore the distinction between local and non-local properties.

Given the ontology of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), this implies that they contain features for person, number and gender.5 index PERSON person NUMBER number GENDER gender The presence of these features in the CONTENT values of verbs may, at first, seem awkward, since they model properties which are typical of N(P)s. A form like greets, for instance, requires its NP subject to have a third person singular index, but does not have a third person singular index of its own, as argued in (Pollard and Sag, 1994, 82). Looking closer, though, the assignment of these features to verbs does have a number of advantages. One is that it accounts for the agreement in clauses with a verbal subject. (28) Forging banknotes is/*are/*am not easy. (29) To make mistakes is/*are/*am human. Since the form is requires a subject with a third person singular index, it follows that the nonfinite VPs in (28) and (29) have a third person singular index, and since phrases share their index with their head daughter, this implies in turn that the verbs forging and make have a third person singular index.6 To avoid misunderst</context>

Snore in (31), for instance, has a third person singular index, but requires its subject to have an index which is plural or nonthird person. In sum, one advantage of the assignment of a third person singular index to verbs is that it accounts in a straightforward manner for the agreement data in (28-31). Another advantage is that the indices provide a way to capture the distinction between the aspectual classes (Aktionsarten). To see this, let us first revisit the role of the indices in nominal objects. As argued in (Pollard and Sag, 1994), the indices are not only useful to model agreement between a finite verb and its subject, or between an anaphoric pronoun and its antecedent, but also between a determiner and its nominal head. The demonstrative these, for instance, requires a nominal with a plural index, whereas this requires a nominal with a singular index. A similar constraint holds for the combination of a quantifying determiner and its head. While every and a require their nominal head to be singular and count, much requires it to be singular and mass: every/a/*much table vs. much/*every/*a traffic. Despite the obvious </context>
