Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a natural language
processing task that consists of identifying the ar-
guments of predicates within a sentence and as-
signing a semantic role to them. This task can
support the extraction of relations from biomedi-
cal texts. Recent research has produced a rich va-
riety of SRL systems to process general domain
corpora. However, only a few systems have been
developed to process biomedical corpora (Tzong-
Han Tsai et al, 2007; Bethard et al., 2008). In
this abstract, we present preliminary results of
a new system that is trained on the GREC cor-
pus (Thompson et al., 2009).
The GREC corpus consists of 240 MEDLINE
abstracts, in which gene regulation events have
been annotated with different types of informa-
tion, like the span of the event and of its argu-
ments, and the semantic role of the arguments.
Events can be verbs (58%) and nominalised verbs
(42%). The corpus is divided into two species-
specific subcorpora: E. coli (167 abstracts, 2394
events) and human (73 abstracts, 673 events).

We perform two preprocessing steps. First, we
extract the text and parse it with the GDep
parser (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007) and then we con-
vert the corpus from xml into CoNLL format. Ta-
ble 1 shows a preprocessed sentence. The sys-
tem performs argument identification and seman-
tic role assignment in a single step, assuming gold
standard event identification. It consists of one
classifier that classifies an instance into one of the
semantic role classes or the NONE class. An in-
stance represents a combination of an event and a
potential argument (PA). In order to generate the
PAs, the system relies on information from the
dependency syntax tree, which means that errors
in the syntactic tree influence directly the perfor-
mance of the system. We consider that the fol-
lowing tokens or combinations of tokens can be
PAs: main verbs, nouns, adjectives, pronouns and
adverbs; main verbs, nouns, adjectives, pronouns
and adverbs with their modifiers to the left in the
string of words; main verbs, nouns, adjectives,
pronouns, adverbs, prepositions and relative pro-
nouns with their modifiers to the left and to the
right in the string of words.
The features extracted to perform the classifica-
tion task are the following:

<listItem confidence="0.992925833333333">
• About the event and the PA: chain of words, lemmas,
POS, and dependency labels of all the tokens; lemma, POS
and dependency label of head token, first token and last token;
lemma and POS of syntactic father of head; lemma, POS,
and dependency label of previous and next three tokens in
the string of words; even type.
• About the dependency tree: feature indicating who is the
ancestor (event, PA, other); lemma, POS, and dependency la-
bel of the first common ancestor of event and PA, if there
is one; chain of dependency labels and chain of POS from
event to common ancestor, and from PA to common ances-
tor, if there is one; chain of dependency labels and chain of
POS from PA to event, if event is ancestor of PA; chain of de-
pendency labels and chain of POS from event to PA, if PA is
ancestor of event; chain of dependency labels and POS from
event to ROOT and from PA to ROOT.
• Normalised distance in number of tokens between event
an potential argument in the string of words.

We use an IB1 memory–based algorithm as im-
plemented in TiMBL (version 6.1.2) 1(Daelemans
et al., 2009), a memory-based classifier based on
the k-nearest neighbor rule. The IB1 algorithm
was parameterised by using Jeffrey divergence as
the similarity metric, gain ratio for feature weight-
ing, using 5 k-nearest neighbors, and weighting

We provide 5 fold cross-validation (CV) and
cross-domain (CD) results in Table 2. The CV re-
sults are obtained by training and testing on dif-
ferent partitions of the same corpus. The CD re-
sults are obtained by training on one corpus and
testing on the other. Although we cannot directly
compare this results with results of other systems
on exactly the same corpus, Sasaki et al. (2008)
report CV results on a corpus of 677 MEDLINE
abstracts on E. Coli gene regulation events. The
precision achieved by their system is 49.00 and
the recall 18.60. We consider that the results of
our system are encouraging to proceed with fur-
ther research.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936142857143">
Future work will deal with incorporating domain
specific knowledge and with improving the ma-
chine learning techniques. We will experiment
with other algorithms, like Conditional Random
Fields, which are well known sequence labelers.
Additionally, we will implement also a constraint
satisfaction algorithm.
