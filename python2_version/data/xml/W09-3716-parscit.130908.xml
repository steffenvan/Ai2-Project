In this paper we introduce a methodology for annotating compo-
sitional operations in natural language text, and describe a mark-up
language, GLML, based on Generative Lexicon, for identifying such
relations. While most annotation systems capture surface relation-
ships, GLML captures the “compositional history” of the argument
selection relative to the predicate. We provide a brief overview of GL
before moving on to our proposed methodology for annotating with
GLML. There are three main tasks described in the paper: (i) Com-
positional mechanisms of argument selection; (ii) Qualia in modifica-
tion constructions; (iii) Type selection in modification of dot objects.
We explain what each task includes and provide a description of the
annotation interface. We also include the XML format for GLML in-
cluding examples of annotated sentences.

1.1 Motivation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996844">
In this paper, we introduce a methodology for annotating compositional
operations in natural language text. Most annotation schemes encoding
“propositional” or predicative content have focused on the identification
of the predicate type, the argument extent, and the semantic role (or label)
assigned to that argument by the predicate (see Palmer et al., 2005, Ruppen-
hofer et al., 2006, Kipper, 2005, Burchardt et al., 2006, Ohara, 2008, Subirats,
2004).
The emphasis here will be on identifying the nature of the composi-
tional operation rather than merely annotating the surface types of the en-
tities involved in argument selection.

Consider the well-known example below. The distinction in semantic
types appearing as subject in (1) is captured by entity typing, but not by any
sense tagging from, e.g., FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006) or PropBank
(Palmer et al., 2005).
(1) a. Mary called yesterday.
b. The Boston office called yesterday.

While this has been treated as type coercion or metonymy in the literature (cf.
Hobbs et al., 1993 , Pustejovsky,1991, Nunberg,1979, Egg, 2005), the point
here is that an annotation using frames associated with verb senses should
treat the sentences on par with one another. Yet this is not possible if the
entity typing given to the subject in (1a) is HUMAN and that given for (1b)
is ORGANIZATION.
The SemEval Metonymy task (Markert and Nissim, 2007) was a good
attempt to annotate such metonymic relations over a larger data set. This
task involved two types with their metonymic variants:
(2) i. Categories for Locations: literal, place-for-people, place-for-event,
place-for-product;
ii. Categories for Organizations: literal, organization-for-members,
organization-for-event, organization-for-product, organization-for-fa-
cility.
One of the limitations with this approach, however, is that, while appropri-
ate for these specialized metonymy relations, the annotation specification
and resulting corpus are not an informative guide for extending the anno-
tation of argument selection more broadly.
In fact, the metonymy example in (1) is an instance of a much more
pervasive phenomenon of type shifting and coercion in argument selection.
For example, in (3) below, the sense annotation for the verb enjoy should
arguably assign similar values to both (3a) and (3b).

(3) a. Mary enjoyed drinking her beer.
b. Mary enjoyed her beer.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99972475">
The consequence of this, however, is that, under current sense and role an-
notation strategies, the mapping to a syntactic realization for a given sense
is made more complex, and is, in fact, perplexing for a clustering or learn-
ing algorithm operating over subcategorization types for the verb.

1.2 Theoretical Preliminaries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999877739130435">
The theoretical foundations for compositional operations within the sen-
tence have long been developed in considerable detail. Furthermore, type
shifting and type coercion operations have been recognized as playing an
important role in many formal descriptions of language, in order to main-
tain compositionality (cf. Partee and Rooth, 1983; Chierchia, 1998; Groe-
nendijk and Stokhof, 1989; Egg, 2005; Pinkal, 1999; Pustejovsky, 1995, and
many others). The goal of the present work is to: (a) create a broadly appli-
cable specification of the compositional operations involved in argument
selection; (b) apply this specification over a corpus of natural language
texts, in order to encode the selection mechanisms implicated in the com-
positional structure of the language.
The creation of a corpus that explicitly identifies the “compositional his-
tory” associated with argument selection will be useful to computational
semantics in several respects: (a) the actual contexts within which type
coercions are allowed can be more correctly identified and perhaps gen-
eralized; (b) machine learning algorithms can take advantage of the map-
ping as an additional feature in the training phase; and (c) some consensus
might emerge on the general list of type-changing operations involved in
argument selection, as the tasks are revised and enriched.
For the purpose of this annotation task, we will adopt the general ap-
proach to argument selection within Generative Lexicon, as recently out-
lined in Pustejovsky (2006) and Asher and Pustejovsky (2006). We can dis-
tinguish the following modes of composition in natural language:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.93547775">
(4) a. PURE SELECTION (Type Matching): the type a function requires is
directly satisfied by the argument;
b. ACCOMMODATION: the type a function requires is inherited by the
argument;
c. TYPE COERCION: the type a function requires is imposed on the
argument type. This is accomplished by either:
i. Exploitation: taking a part of the argument’s type;
ii. Introduction: wrapping the argument with the required type.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986665">
Each of these will be identified as a unique relation between the predicate
and a given argument. In this annotation effort, we restrict the possible
relations between the predicate and a given argument to selection and coer-
cion. A more fine-grained typology of relations may be applied at a later

point. Furthermore, qualia structure values1 are identified in both argu-
ment selection and modification contexts.
The rest of this document proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe
our general methodology and architecture for GL annotation. Section 3
gives an overview of each of the annotation tasks as well as some details
on the resulting GLML markup. A more thorough treatment of the material

In this section, we describe the set of tasks for annotating compositional
mechanisms within the GL framework. The current GL markup will in-
clude the following tasks, each of which is described below in Section 3.

2.1 System Architecture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.862797631578947">
Each GLML annotation task involves two phases: the data set construction
phase and the annotation phase. The first phase consists of (1) selecting the
target words to be annotated and compiling a sense inventory for each tar-
get, and (2) data extraction and preprocessing. The prepared data is then
loaded into the annotation interface. During the annotation phase, the an-
notation judgments are entered into the database, and the adjudicator re-
solves disagreements. The resulting database representation is used by the
exporting module to generate the corresponding XML markup, stand-off
annotation, or GL logical form.
These steps will differ slightly for each of the major GLML annotation
tasks. For example, Task 1 focuses on annotating compositional processes
between the verbs and their arguments. The first step for this task involves
(1) selecting the set of target verbs, (2) compiling a sense inventory for each
1The qualia structure, inspired by Moravcsik (1975)’s interpretation of the aitia of Aris-
totle, is defined as the modes of explanation of a word or phrase, and defined below (Puste-
jovsky, 1991): (a) FORMAL: the category distinguishing the meaning of a word within a
larger domain; (b) CONSTITUTIVE: the relation between an object and its constituent parts;
(c) TELIC: the purpose or function of the object, if there is one; (d) AGENTIVE: the factors
involved in the object’s origins or “coming into being”.

target, and (3) associating a type template or a set of templates with each
sense. Since the objective of the task is to annotate coercion, our choices
must include the verbs that exhibit the coercive behavior at least in some of
their senses.
At the next step, the data containing the selected target words is ex-
tracted from a corpus and preprocessed. Since the GLML annotation is
intra-sentential, each extracted instance is a sentence. Sentences are parsed
to identify the relevant arguments, adjuncts or modifiers for each target.
The data is presented to the annotatator with the target word and the head-
word of the relevant phrase highlighted.
Due to the complexity of the GLML annotation, we chose to use the
task-based annotation architecture. The annotation environment is designed
so that the annotator can focus on one facet of the annotation at a time.
Thus, in Task 1, the verbs are disambiguated by the annotator in one sub-
task, and the annotation of the actual compositional relationship is done in
another subtask. Figure 1 shows an example of the interface for the verb-
based annotation task.

2.2 The Type System for Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999831818181818">
The type system we have chosen for annotation is purposefully shallow,
but we also aimed to include types that would ease the complexity of the
annotation task. The type system is not structured in a hierarchy, but rather
it is presented as a set of types. For example, we include both HUMAN and
ANIMATE in the type system along with PHYSICAL OBJECT. While HUMAN
is a subtype of both ANIMATE and PHYSICAL OBJECT, the annotator does
not need to be concerned with this. This allows the annotator to simply
choose the HUMAN type when necessary rather than having to deal with
type inheritance.
While the set of types for GLML annotation can easily be modified, the
following list is currently being used:

In this section, we describe the annotation process: the steps involved in
each task and the way they are presented to the annotators. In this paper,
we focus on the task descriptions rather than an in depth review of the
annotation interface and the resulting GLML markup.
The general methodology for each task is as follows: 1) Select a target
set of words and compile a sense inventory for each one, 2) Select a set of
sentences for each target, 3) Disambiguate the sense of the target in a given
sentence, and 4) Answer questions specific to the annotation task in order
to create the appropriate GLML link.

3.1 Mechanisms of Argument Selection: Verb-based Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981756222222222">
This annotation task involves choosing which selectional mechanism is
used by the predicate over a particular argument. The possible relations
between the predicate and a given argument will, for now, be restricted
to selection and coercion. In selection, the argument NP satisfies the typ-
ing requirements of the predicate, as in The child threw the stone (PHYS-
ICAL OBJECT). Coercion encompasses all cases when a type-shifting op-
eration (exploitation or introduction) must be performed on the comple-
ment NP in order to satisfy selectional requirements of the predicate, as in
The White House (LOCATION → HUMAN) denied this statement.

<bodyText confidence="0.999207583333333">
An initial set of verbs and sentences containing them has been selected
for annotation. For each sentence, the compositional relationship of the
verb with every argument and adjunct will be annotated. The target types
for each argument are provided in a type template that is associated with
the sense of the verb in the given sentence. For example, one of the senses
of the verb deny (glossed as “State or maintain that something is untrue”)
would have the following type template: HUMAN deny PROPOSITION.
In the first subtask, the annotator is presented with a set of sentences
containing the target verb and the chosen grammatical relation. The anno-
tator is asked to select the most fitting sense of the target verb, or to throw
out the example (pick the “N/A” option) if no sense can be chosen either
due to insufficient context, because the appropriate sense does not appear
in the inventory, or simply no disambiguation can be made in good faith.
Next, the annotator is presented with a list of sentences in which the
target verb is used in the same sense and is asked to determine whether the
argument in the specified grammatical relation belongs to the type speci-
fied in the corresponding template. If the argument belongs to the appro-
priate type, the “yes” box is clicked, generating a CompLink with comp-
Type=“SELECTION”. If “no” is selected, a type selection menu pops up
below the first question, and the annotator is asked to pick a type from a
list of shallow types which is usually associated with the argument. Con-
sequently, a CompLink with compType=”COERCION” is created with the
corresponding source and target type.
The following example of GLML markup is generated from the database2:

3.2 Qualia Selection in Modification Constructions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.90906775">
For this task, the relevant semantic relations are defined in terms of the
qualia structure. We examine two kinds of constructions in this task: adjec-
tival modification of nouns and nominal compounds3.
2While we present these examples as an inline annotation, a LAF (Ide and Romary, 2003)
compliant offset annotation is fully compatible with GLML.
3Since target nouns have already been selected for these two tasks, it is also possible
to annotate qualia selection in verb-noun contexts such as Can you shine the lamp over here?
(TELIC). However, here we focus solely on the modification contexts mentioned here.

3.2.1 Adjectival Modification of Nouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997435045454546">
This task involves annotating how particular noun qualia values are bound
by the adjectives. Following Pustejovsky (2000), we assume that the prop-
erties grammatically realized as adjectives ”bind into the qualia structure
of nouns, to select a narrow facet of the noun’s meaning.” For example, in
the NP “a sharp metal hunting knife”, sharp refers to the knife as a physi-
cal object, its FORMAL type, metal is associated with a material part of the
knife (CONSTITUTIVE), and hunting is associated with how the knife is used
(TELIC). Similarly, forged in “a forged knife” is associated with the creation
of the knife (AGENTIVE).
The task begins with sense disambiguation of the target nouns. Ques-
tions are then used to help the annotator identify which qualia relations are
selected. For example, the TELIC question for the noun table would be ”Is
this adjective associated with the inherent purpose of table?” These ques-
tions will change according to the type associated with the noun. Thus,
for natural types such as woman, the TELIC question would be ”Is this ad-
jective associated with a specific role of woman?” Similarly, for the AGEN-
TIVE role, the question corresponding to the PHYSICAL OBJECT-denoting
nouns refers to the ”making or destroying” the object, while for the EVENT-
denoting nouns, the same question involves ”beginning or ending” of the
event. QLinks are then created based on the annotator’s answers, as in the
following example:
The walls and the wooden table had all been lustily scrubbed.

3.2.2 Nominal Compounds
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926555555555">
This task explores the semantic relationship between elements in nominal
compounds. The general relations presented in Levi (1978) are a useful
guide for beginning a classification of compound types, but the relations
between compound elements quickly prove to be too coarse-grained. War-
ren’s comprehensive work (Warren, 1978) is a valuable resource for differ-
entiating relation types between compound elements.
The class distinction in compound types in language can be broken
down into three forms (Spencer, 1991): endocentric compounds, exocen-
tric compounds, and dvandva compounds. Following Bisetto and Scalise
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997103">
176
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998997">
(2005), however, it is possible to distinguish three slightly differently con-
structed classes of compounds, each exhibiting endocentric and exocentric
behavior: subordinating, attributtive, and coordinate.
We will focus on the two classes of subordinating and attributive com-
pounds. Within each of these, we will distinguish between synthetic and
non-synthetic compounds. The former are deverbal nouns, and when act-
ing functionally (subordinating), take the sister noun as an argument, as
in bus driver and window cleaner. The non-synthetic counterparts of these
include pastry chef and bread knife, where the head is not deverbal in any
obvious way. While Bisetto and Scalise’s distinction is a useful one, it does
little to explain how non-relational sortal nouns such as chef and knife act
functionally over the accompanying noun in the compound, as above.
This construction has been examined within GL by Johnston and Busa
(1999). We will assume much of that analysis in our definition of the task
described here. Our basic assumption regarding the nature of the seman-
tic link between both parts of compounds is that it is generally similar to
the one present in adjectival modification. The only difference is that in
nominal compounds, for instance, the qualia of a head noun are activated
or exploited by a different kind of modifier, a noun. Given this similar-
ity, the annotation for this task is performed just as it is for the adjectival
modification task. A QLink is created as in the following example:

3.3 Type Selection in Modification of Dot Objects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998492">
This task involves annotating how particular types within dot objects are
exploited in adjectival and nominal modification constructions. Dot objects
or complex types (Pustejovsky, 1995) are defined as the product of a type
constructor • (”dot”), which creates dot objects from any two types a and
b , creating a • b. Complex types are unique because they are made up of
seemingly incompatible types such as FOOD and EVENT.
Given a complex type c = a • b, there are three possible options: 1) the
modifier applies to both a and b, 2) the modifier applies to a only, or 3) the
modifier applies to b only. Option 1 would be illustrated by examples such
as good book [+info, +physobj] and long test [+info, +event]. Examples such as

delicious lunch [+food, -event] and long lunch [-food, +event] illustrate options
2 and 3. A listing of dot objects can be found in Pustejovsky (2005).
The sense inventory for the collection of dot objects chosen for this task
will include only homonyms. That is, only contrastive senses such as the
river bank versus financial institution for bank will need to be disambiguated.
Complementary senses such as the financial institution itself versus the
building where it is located are not included.
In order to create the appropriate CompLink, the annotator will select
which type from a list of component types for a given dot object is exploited
in the sentence. The resulting GLML is:

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999840428571429">
In this paper, we approach the problem of annotating the relation between
a predicate and its argument as one that encodes the compositional history
of the selection process. This allows us to distinguish surface forms that di-
rectly satisfy the selectional (type) requirements of a predicate from those
that are accommodated or coerced in context. We described a specification
language for selection, GLML, based largely on the type selective opera-
tions in GL, and three annotation tasks using this specification to identify
argument selection behavior.
There are clearly many compositional operations in language that have
not been addressed in this paper. The framework is general enough, how-
ever, to describe a broad range of type selective behavior. As the tasks be-
come more refined, the extensions will also become clearer. Furthermore,
as other languages are examined for annotation, new tasks will emerge re-
flecting perhaps language-specific constructions.

<abstract confidence="0.999376785714286">In this paper we introduce a methodology for annotating compositional operations in natural language text, and describe a mark-up language, GLML, based on Generative Lexicon, for identifying such relations. While most annotation systems capture surface relationships, GLML captures the “compositional history” of the argument selection relative to the predicate. We provide a brief overview of GL before moving on to our proposed methodology for annotating with GLML. There are three main tasks described in the paper: (i) Compositional mechanisms of argument selection; (ii) Qualia in modification constructions; (iii) Type selection in modification of dot objects. We explain what each task includes and provide a description of the annotation interface. We also include the XML format for GLML including examples of annotated sentences.</abstract>

For the purpose of this annotation task, we will adopt the general approach to argument selection within Generative Lexicon, as recently outlined in Pustejovsky (2006) and Asher and Pustejovsky (2006). We can distinguish the following modes of composition in natural language: (4) a. PURE SELECTION (Type Matching): the type a function requires is directly satisfied by the argument; b. ACCOMMODATION: the type a function requires is inherited by the argument; c. TYPE COERCION: the type a function requires is imposed on the argument type. This is accomplished by either: i. Exploitation: taking a part of the argument’s type; ii. Introduction: wrapping the argument with the required type.

Most annotation schemes encoding “propositional” or predicative content have focused on the identification of the predicate type, the argument extent, and the semantic role (or label) assigned to that argument by the predicate (see Palmer et al., 2005, Ruppenhofer et al., 2006, Kipper, 2005, Burchardt et al., 2006, Ohara, 2008, Subirats, 2004).

We examine two kinds of constructions in this task: adjectival modification of nouns and nominal compounds3. 2While we present these examples as an inline annotation, a LAF (Ide and Romary, 2003) compliant offset annotation is fully compatible with GLML. 3Since target nouns have already been selected for these two tasks, it is also possible to annotate qualia selection in verb-noun contexts such as Can you shine the lamp over here? (TELIC). However, here we focus solely on the modification contexts mentioned here. 175 3.2.1 Adjectival Modification of Nouns This task involves annotating how particular noun qualia values are bound by the adjectives.

The former are deverbal nouns, and when acting functionally (subordinating), take the sister noun as an argument, as in bus driver and window cleaner. The non-synthetic counterparts of these include pastry chef and bread knife, where the head is not deverbal in any obvious way. While Bisetto and Scalise’s distinction is a useful one, it does little to explain how non-relational sortal nouns such as chef and knife act functionally over the accompanying noun in the compound, as above. This construction has been examined within GL by Johnston and Busa (1999). We will assume much of that analysis in our definition of the task described here. Our basic assumption regarding the nature of the semantic link between both parts of compounds is that it is generally similar to the one present in adjectival modification. The only difference is that in nominal compounds, for instance, the qualia of a head noun are activated or exploited by a different kind of modifier, a noun. Given this similarity, the annotation for this task is performed just as it is for the adjectival modification task. A QLink is created as in the following example: Our guest house st</context>

The general relations presented in Levi (1978) are a useful guide for beginning a classification of compound types, but the relations between compound elements quickly prove to be too coarse-grained. Warren’s comprehensive work (Warren, 1978) is a valuable resource for differentiating relation types between compound elements. The class distinction in compound types in language can be broken down into three forms (Spencer, 1991): endocentric compounds, exocentric compounds, and dvandva compounds.

Complex types are unique because they are made up of seemingly incompatible types such as FOOD and EVENT. Given a complex type c = a • b, there are three possible options: 1) the modifier applies to both a and b, 2) the modifier applies to a only, or 3) the modifier applies to b only.

However, here we focus solely on the modification contexts mentioned here. 175 3.2.1 Adjectival Modification of Nouns This task involves annotating how particular noun qualia values are bound by the adjectives. Following Pustejovsky (2000), we assume that the properties grammatically realized as adjectives ”bind into the qualia structure of nouns, to select a narrow facet of the noun’s meaning.” For example, in the NP “a sharp metal hunting knife”, sharp refers to the knife as a physical object, its FORMAL type, metal is associated with a material part of the knife (CONSTITUTIVE), and hunting is associated with how the knife is used (TELIC). Similarly, forged in “a forged knife” is associated with the creation of the knife (AGENTIVE). The task begins with sense disambiguation of the target nouns. Questions are then used to help</context>

For the purpose of this annotation task, we will adopt the general approach to argument selection within Generative Lexicon, as recently outlined in Pustejovsky (2006) and Asher and Pustejovsky (2006). We can distinguish the following modes of composition in natural language: (4) a. PURE SELECTION (Type Matching): the type a function requires is directly satisfied by the argument; b. ACCOMMODATION: the type a function requires is inherited by the argument; c. TYPE COERCION: the type a function requires is imposed on the argument type. This is accomplished by either: i. Exploitation: taking a part of the argument’s type; ii. Introduction: wrapping the argument with the required type.
