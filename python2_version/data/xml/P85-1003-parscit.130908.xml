<bodyText confidence="0.998398413793103">
This paper explores the relationships between a
computational theory of temporal representation (as developed by
James Allen) and a formal linguistic theory of tense (as developed
by Norbert Hornstein) and aspect. It aims to provide explicit
answers to four fundamental questions: (1) what is the
computational lustification for the primitives of a linguistic theory;
(2) what is the computational explanation of the formal
grammatical constraints: (3) what are the processing constraints
imposed on the learnability and markedness of these theoretical
constructs; and (4) what are the constraints that a linguistic theory
imposes or representations. We show that one can effectively
exploit the interface between the language faculty and the
cognitive faculties by using linguistic constraints to determine
restrictions on the cognitive representations and vice versa.
Three main results are obtained: (1) We derive an
explanation of an observed grammatical constraint on tense-- the
Linear Order Constraint from the information monotonicity
property of the constraint propagation algorithm of Allen&apos;s
temooral system; (2) We formulate a principle of markedness for
the basic tense structures based on the computational efficiency
of the temporal representations: and (3) We snow Allen&apos;s
interval-based temporal system is not arbitrary, but it can be used
to explair, mdependantly motivated linguistic constraints on tense
and aspect interpretations.
We also claim that the methodology of research developed in
this study &amp;quot;cross-level&amp;quot; investigation of independently motivated
formal grammatical theory and computational models is a
powerful paradigm with which to attack representational problems
in oasic domains, e.g.. space, time, causality, etc.

<bodyText confidence="0.999538941176471">
One maior effort in modern linguistics is to limit the class of
possible grammars to those that are psychologically real. A
grammar is psychologically real if it is (a) realiza ale possessing
a computational model that can reproduce certain psychological
resource complexity measures, and (b) learnable capable of
being acquired (at least, in principle) despite the poor quality of
input linguistic data. A shift of emphasis from the pure
characterization problem of grammar to the realization and
learnability problems naturally brings linguistics closer to Al work
in natural language understanding concerned with computational
models of language use and language acquisition. Computational
study is in principle complementary to more formal and abstract
grammatical theory. Each should contribute to the other.
The purpose of this paper is to work out an example of how
formal grammatical theory and computational models can
effectively constrain eacn other s representations. In particular, I
seek to explore four fundamental issues:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.942957375">
1. How is the choice of primitive structures in grammatical
theory to be iustified?
2. What is the explanation of the rules and constraints that
have to be stipulated at the grammatical level?
3. How are these knowledge structures acquired?
4. What are the theoretical constraints imposed by the
grammar on the representational scneme of the
computation theory?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971779652173913">
What I hope to show is that structures and principles that
have to be stipulated at the grammatical level fall out naturally as
consequences of the properties of the algorithms and
representations of the underlying computational model. In so
doing, I will also restrict the class of plausible computational
models to those that can explain or incorporate the constraints
imposed by the formal grammatical theory.
There are a number of requirements that must be met in
order for such &amp;quot;cross.level&amp;quot; study to succeed. First, there is a
sizable collection of facts arc data from the target domain to be
explained. Second. there is independent motivation for the theory
of grammar it is empirically adequate. And, third, the
computational model is also innependently motivated by being
sufficiently expressive and computationally efficient.
With these Considerations, I have chosen two domains: (1)
tense and (2) aspect. Tense concerns the chronological ordering
of situations with respect to some reference moment. usually the
moment of speech. Aspect is the study of situation types and
perspectives from which a particular situation can be viewed or
evaivated (cf. Comrie75) The point of departure of this study is
two papers: (1) for the theory of tense, Hornstein&apos;s &amp;quot;Towards a
theory of Tense&amp;quot; (Hornstetn77) and (2) for the cognitive theory of
time. James Allen&apos;s &amp;quot;Towards a General Theory of Action and

2. We derive an explanation of Hornstein&apos;s Linear Order
Constraint, an observed formal constraint on linguistic
tense, from properties of the constraint propagation
algorithm of Allen&apos;s temporal system. This shows this
formal grammatical constraint need not be learned at all.
We also show that the rule of R-permanence follows
from the hypothesis that only tne matrix clause and the
subcategorizable SCOMP or VCOMP can introduce
distinct S and R points. Finally, we prove that certain
boundedness condition on the flow of information of a
processing system leads directly to the locality property
of a constraint on sequences of tense.

idea that the progressive aspect specifies the
perspective from which the truth of a situation is

three distinct time points are necessary to characterize

We begin by first outlining Hornstein&apos;s theory of tense. In

2.1 Revisions to Hornstein&apos;s Theory of Tense
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9662415">
Hornstein develops a theory of tense within the
Reicnenbachian framework which postulates tnree theoretical
entities: S (the moment of speech), R (a reference point), and E
(the moment of event). The key idea is that certain linear
orderings of the three lime points get grammaticalized into the six
basic tenses of English) The following is the list cf basic tense
structures:
I. Hornstein actually astral none basic tenses. but I trunk the preoperative belongs
(O the province of aspect rather than tense.
The notation here demands some explanation. The
underscore symbol &amp;quot;_&amp;quot; is interpreted as the &amp;quot;less-than&amp;quot; relation
among time points whereas the comma symbol &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; stands for the
&amp;quot;less-than-or-equal-to&amp;quot; relation. As an illustration, the present
perfect tense denotes a situation in which the moment of speech
is either cotemporaneous or precedes the reference point, while
the moment of event is strictly before the other two moments.
Note that Hornstein also uses the term &amp;quot;association&amp;quot; to refer to
the comma symbol
Given the basic tense structure for a simple tensed sentence,
the interpretation of the sentence that arises from the interaction
of tense and time adverbs is represented by the modification of the
position of the R or E points to form a new tense structure which
we call a derived tense structure. In two papers (Hornstein77 &amp;
Hornstein81), Hornstein proposes three formal constraints that
limit the class of derived tense structures that can be generated
from the basic tense structures in such a way as to capture the
acceptability of sentences containing temporal adverbs (e.g.. now,
yesterday, tomorrow). temporal connectives (e.g., when, before,
atter), and indirect soeech. In the rest of this section. I shall
examine the adeauacy of these constraints.

2.1.1 Linear Order Constraint
The Linear Order Constraint (LOC) states tnat (p.523-4):
(1) The linear oraer of a derived tense structure must be the same
as the linear oraer of the basic structure.
(2) No new association is produced in the derived tense structure.
LOC is stipulated to account for examples consisting of a
single temporal adverb such as (4a) and those with two time
adverbs such as 32).2i
4a. John came home i. now, at this very moment
H. yesterday
iii. *tomorrow
32 a. John left a week ago [from] yesterday.
ti. [From] Yesterday, John left a week ago.
c. &apos;A week ago. John left [from] yesterday.
The basic tense structure for 4(ai) is:

The crucial example. however, is 5(c):3

ii. &apos;tomorrow
iii. yesterday.
LOC predicts (wrongly) that 5cii is good and 5ciii bad.4 But LOC
gives the wrong prediction only on the assumption that the basic
tense structures are correct. To account for Sc. I propose to save
the LOC and change the following SRE association with the
present perfect:
</tableCaption>
<figure confidence="0.875418277777778">
PRESENT PERFECT E_FIS
With the modified basic tense structure for present perfect. LOC
will give the correct analysis. 5cii is bad because:
tomorrow

[21 John comes when we have arrived.
For [lithe new analysis is:
E.R S E.R_S

which does not violate the RTC and hence predicts (wrongly) that
[1] is acceptable. Similarly, for [2], the new analysis is:
S.R,E S,R.E (violates RTC)
1
E R . S E S R
which predicts (wrongly) that [21 is bad.

<bodyText confidence="0.800595722222222">
This may explain why Hornstein decides to use E_S,R for
the present perfect because it can account for (11 and (21 with no
difficulty. However. I suggest that the correct move should be to
abandon RTC which has an asymmetrical property, i.e., it matters
whether P1 or P2 is put on top, and does not nave an obvious
semantic explanation. (See Hornstetn&apos;s footnote 20, p.543). My
second proposal is then to replace RTC with a Rule of
R.permanence (RP) stating that:
(RP): Both the S and R points of P/ and P2 must be aligned
without any manipulation of the tense structure for P2.
5ciii is acceptable since:
yesterday

The question that naturally arises at this point is: Why does is acceptable because its tense structure does not violate RP:
Hornstein not choose my proposed SPE structure for the present

The rule for temporal connectives (RTC) states that
(p.539-40):

up the S points of PI and P2, that is. write the tense structure of
P1 and P2, lining up the S points. Move R2 to under RI, placing

We can see that the proposed theory correctly predicts all of the
five cases. There is. however, an apparent counter-example to RP
which, unlike RTC, is symmetrical. i.e., it does not matter which of
the Pi&apos;s is put on the top. Consider the following two sentences:
</bodyText>

[5] i. John will come when we arrive.
&apos;ii. °John arrives when we will come.

<bodyText confidence="0.999707909090909">
RP predicts both 5i and 5ii will be unacceptable. but Si seems to
be good. It is examples like 5i and 5ii, I believe, that lead
Hornstein to propose the asymmetrical rule RTC. But I think the
data are misleading because It seems to be an idiosyncrasy of
English grammar that 5i is acceptable. In French, we have to say
an equivalent of &amp;quot;John will come when we will arrive&amp;quot; with the
temporal adverbial explicitly marked with the future tense
(Jespersen6.6. p.264). Thus, the acceptability of sentences like 5)
can be explained by a principle of Economy of Speech allowing us
to omit the future tense of the temporal adverbial if the matrix
clause is already marked with the future tense.

2.1.3 Sequences of Tense

Now, we describe the third and final grammatical constraint

In the (a) sentence, the temporal interpretation of the embedded
sentence S evaluated with respect to the moment of speech.
Thus, for instance, [6a] means that Mary&apos;s leaving is 3 days after
present moment of speech. On the other hand, the (b) sentence
has the temporal interpretation of the embedded sentence
evaluated with respect to the interpretation of the matrix clause,
i.e., (6b) means that Mary&apos;s leaving is 4 days before the moment of

days after the moment of speech. and (2) in 7(cii), Mary&apos;s leaving is
two days before the moment of speech. In particular, there is not
a temporal reading corresponding to the situation in which Mary&apos;s
leaving is five days before the moment of speech. We would
obtain the third reading if SOT allowed non-local linking, e.g.,
assigned S3 with E1.

2.2 Explanations of the Formal Constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983292909090909">
In the previous section, we have examined three formal
constraints on the derivation of complex tense structures from the
basic tense structures: (1) LOC. (2) RP, and (3) SOT. Now, I want
to show how the LOC falls out naturally from the computational
properties of a temporal reasoning system along the line
suggested by Allen (Allen84, Allen83), and also how the RP and
SOT constraints have intuitive computational motivation.
The basis of Allen&apos;s computational system is a temporal logic
based on intervals instead of time points. The temporal logic
consists of seven basic relations and their inverses (A11en84,
p.129, figure 1):
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999599">
The reasoning scheme is a form of constraint propagation in a
network of event nodes linked by temporal relationships. For
instance, the situation as described in the sentence &amp;quot;John arrived
when we came&amp;quot; is represented by the network:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9273228">
A -- ( ) &lt; m mi =) --&gt; 8
N Z
( &lt; ) ( &lt; )
\I. e
NOW
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.975976714285714">
where A John&apos;s arrival and 8 Our coming
This network means that both event A and event B are before now,
the moment of speech, while A can be before, after or
simultaneous with B.
When new temporal relationships are added, the system
maintains consistency among events by propagating the effects of
the new relationships via a Table of Transitivity Relationships that
tells the system how to deduce the set of admissible relationships
between events A and C given the relationships between A and B,
and between B and C. Thus, for instance, from the relationships
&amp;quot;A during B&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;B &lt; C&amp;quot;, the system can deduce &amp;quot;A &lt;C&amp;quot;.
One property of the constraint propagation algorithm
generally is that further information only causes removal of
members from the set of admissible labels, i.e., temporal
relationships, between any two old events (A11en83. p.835). No
new label can be added to the admissible set once it is created.
Let us call this property of the constraint propagation algorithm
tne Delete Label Condition (DLC). DLC can be interpreted as a
kind of information monotonicity condition on the temporal
representation.
Let us further restrict Allen&apos;s temporal logic to Instantaneous
intervals. i.e.. each event corresponds to a single moment of time.
The restricted logic has only one primitive relation, and three
other derived relations: &lt;, &gt;, and &gt;. There is a straightforward
translation of Hornstein&apos;s SRE notation into the network
representation, namely, replace each comma symbol &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; by &lt; (or
&gt; with the event symbols reverse their roles) and each
unaerscore symbol &amp;quot;_&amp;quot; by &gt; (or &lt; with similar adjustment on the
event symbols). Thus, a tense structure such as: E_R,S can be
represented as:
With this representation scheme, we can prove the following
theorem:
(Ti) DLC LOC
Let A and B range over ( S. R. E) and A B. There are five
basic types 01 violations of the LOC:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.517595">

3. A_B B.A
4. A.B B,A
5. A,B B_A
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8489705">
We can see that each of these cases is a violation of the DLC. To
spell this out. we have the following operations on the constraint
network corresponding to the above violations of the LOC:
A.(C).&gt;E3 —A-(&gt;08
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.90373825">

5&apos;. A .(/.. = )•&gt; —.A .()).&gt;B
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998311764705882">
In each of these cases. the operation Involves the addition of new
members to the admissible set. This is ruled out by PLC. Thus,
we have the result that if LOC is violated, then ()LC is violated. In
other words. PLC LOC.5
The second constraint to be accounted for is the RP which
effectively states that (a) the S points of the matrix clause and the
temporal adverbial must be identical. and (b) the R points of the
matrix clause and the temporal adverbial must be identical. One
hypothesis for this rule is that:
(H1) Only the matrix clause introduces distinct S and R points.
In other words, the non-subcategorizable temporal adjuncts do
not add new S and R points.
H1 has to be modified slightly to take the case of embedded
sentence into account, namely,
(Revised RP): Only the matrix clause and the subcategorizable
SCOMP or VCOMP can introduce distinct S and R points.

The S rule introduces a new S point and sets its value to now. The
VP rule has two effects: (1) it does not introduce new S or R points
for the temporal adverbial phrase, thus implicitly incorporating the
revised RP rule, and (2) it looks at the tense of the embedded
sentential complement, setting the value of its S point to that of the
E point of the higher clause if the tense is past, and to now,
otherwise. Thus, in this way, the second effect accomplishes what
the SOT rule demands.

If the revisions to Hornstein&apos;s theory of tense are correct, the
natural question to oe asked is: How do speakers attain such
knowledge? This question has two parts: (1) How do speakers
acquire the formal constraints on SRE derivation? and (2) How do
speakers learn to associate the appropriate SRE structures with
the basic tenses of the language?
(3) Label ings that are consistent and the SE link
is constrained by the SR and RE link (16). e.g..
If we assume that labefings of the third type correspond to the
unmarked SRE configurations, the following division of unmarked
and marked configurations is obtained:
Let us consider the first sub-question. In the case of LOC. UNMARKED MARKED
we have a neat answer the constraint need NOT be learned at
all! We have shown that LOC falls out naturally as a consequence
of the architecture and processing algorithm of the computational
system. As regards the constraint RP. the learner has to acquire
something similar to HI. But HI is a fairly simple hypothesis that
does not seem to require induction on extensive linguistic data.
Finally, as we have shown in the previous section, the
boundeaness of the flow of information of a processing system
leads directly to he locality property of the SOT. The particular
linking of S and E points as stipulated by the SOT, however, is a
parameter of the Universal Grammar that has to be fixed.
What about the second sub-question? How do speakers
learn to pair SRE configurations with the basic tenses? There are
24 possible SRE configurations seven of which get
grammaticalized. Here I want to propose a principle of
markedness of SRE structures that has a natural computational
motivation.
There are only eight unmarked tense structures
corresponding to the sixteen SRE network configurations of type 3

The interesting result is that five out of the six basic tenses
have unmarked SRE configurations. This agrees largely with our
pretheoretical intuition that the SRE configurations that
correspond to the basic tenses should be more &amp;quot;unmarked&amp;quot; than
Other possible SRE configurations. The fit, however, is not exact
because the future perfect tense becomes the marked tense in
this classification.
Another prediction by this principle of markedness is that
both the simple future (S_R,E) and distant future (S_R_E) are
unmarked. It would be interesting to find out whether there are
languages in which the distant future actually gets
grammaticalized.
The final point to be made is about the second type of
labelings. There are two other possible ways of grouping the
labelings: (1) given SR and SE. those labelings in which RE is
constrained. and (2) given SE and RE, those in which SR is
constrained. But these types of grouping are less likely because
they would yield the simple present tense as a marked tense.
Thus, they can be ruled out by relatively few linguistic data.

3. Verb Aspect
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983222222222">
In considering the problem of tense, we have restricted
ourselves to a subset of Allen*s temporal logic, namely, using a
temporal structure &lt;T.&lt;&gt; with linear ordering of time points. To
make use of the full power of Allen&apos;s temporal logic, we now turn
to the problem of verb aspect.
The two main problems ot the study of verb aspect are the
correct characterization 01 (1) the three fundamental types of verb
predication according to the situation types that they signify --
state. process and event. and (2) the perspectives from which a
situation is viewed, or its truth evaluated simple or progressive.6
In the first part of his paper. Allen attempts to provide a formal
account of the state/process/event distinction using a temporal
logic. However. I believe that his characterization fails to capture
well-known patterns of tense implications, and does not make the
distinction between situation types and perspective types
fundamental to any adequate account of verb aspect. In the next
section, I will °resent some data that any theory of verb aspect
must be able to explain.

This theorem raises the following question: Why do some
statives occur with the progressive? I thinx there are two answers.
First, the verb in question may have a use other than the stative
use (e.g. &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; is a stative when it means &amp;quot;possession&amp;quot;. and not
a stative when it means &amp;quot;experiencing&amp;quot; as in &amp;quot;John is having a
good time in Paris.&amp;quot;) Second. the English progressive may have a
second meaning in addition to that cnaractenzed by PROG above.
A frecuent usage of the progressive is to indicate snort duration or
temporariness. e.g., in &amp;quot;They are living in Cambridge&apos; /&amp;quot;They live

Perspective is a way of looking at the situation type. For process
or event, the simple aspect treats the situation as an
instantaneous interval even though the situation itself may not be
instantaneous. For state. the simple aspect retains its duration.
The progressive aspect essentially views a process or event from
its interior, thus requiring a stance in which the situation is a
non-instantaneous interval and the admissible temporal
relationship to be the C relations, i.e., s, si, t, ti, d, di, equal.
Let me show graphically how C.ASPECT accounts for the
aspect interpretations of sentences (91 to 021.

explaining phenomena that exist on a entirely different -• linguistic

connectives.
The study of linguistic semantics also sheds light on a
representation of time by revealing the fundamental distinctions
that must be made. e.g.. a tensed sentence involves three distinct
time points, and the aspectual interpretations require
instantaneous/non-instantaneous interval distinction.

<abstract confidence="0.99906999609375">This paper explores the relationships between a computational theory of temporal representation (as developed by James Allen) and a formal linguistic theory of tense (as developed by Norbert Hornstein) and aspect. It aims to provide explicit to four fundamental questions: what is computational lustification for the primitives of a linguistic theory; (2) what is the computational explanation of the formal grammatical constraints: (3) what are the processing constraints imposed on the learnability and markedness of these theoretical and are the constraints that a linguistic theory imposes or representations. We show that one can effectively exploit the interface between the language faculty and the cognitive faculties by using linguistic constraints to determine on the cognitive representations and versa. Three main results are obtained: (1) We derive an explanation of an observed grammatical constraint on tense-the Linear Order Constraint from the information monotonicity property of the constraint propagation algorithm of Allen&apos;s temooral system; (2) We formulate a principle of markedness for the basic tense structures based on the computational efficiency of the temporal representations: and (3) We snow Allen&apos;s interval-based temporal system is not arbitrary, but it can be used to explair, mdependantly motivated linguistic constraints on tense and aspect interpretations. We also claim that the methodology of research developed in this study &amp;quot;cross-level&amp;quot; investigation of independently motivated formal grammatical theory and computational models is a powerful paradigm with which to attack representational problems in oasic domains, e.g.. space, time, causality, etc. 1. Objectives and Main Results One maior effort in modern linguistics is to limit the class of possible grammars to those that are psychologically real. A grammar is psychologically real if it is (a) realiza ale possessing a computational model that can reproduce certain psychological complexity measures, and learnable capable of (at least, in principle) despite the poor quality of linguistic data. A shift of emphasis from the pure problem grammar to the realization learnability problems naturally brings linguistics closer to Al work in natural language understanding concerned with computational models of language use and language acquisition. Computational study is in principle complementary to more formal and abstract grammatical theory. Each should contribute to the other. The purpose of this paper is to work out an example of how grammatical theory and computational models effectively constrain eacn other s representations. In particular, I to explore four fundamental 1. How is the choice of primitive structures in grammatical theory to be iustified? 2. What is the explanation of the rules and constraints that to be stipulated at the grammatical 3. How are these knowledge structures acquired? What are theoretical constraints imposed by the on the representational scneme of computation theory? hope to show is that structures and principles that to be the grammatical level fall out naturally as consequences of the properties of the algorithms and representations of the underlying computational model. In so I will also restrict the class of models to those that can explain or incorporate the constraints imposed by the formal grammatical theory. are a number of requirements that must in order for such &amp;quot;cross.level&amp;quot; study to succeed. First, there is a collection of arc from the target domain to be Second. independent motivation for grammar it is empirically adequate. And, the model is also innependently by expressive efficient. With these Considerations, I have chosen two domains: (1) tense and (2) aspect. Tense concerns the chronological ordering of situations with respect to some reference moment. usually the moment of speech. Aspect is the study of situation types and perspectives from which a particular situation can be viewed or evaivated (cf. Comrie75) The point of departure of this study is papers: (1) for the theory of tense, Hornstein&apos;s a theory of Tense&amp;quot; (Hornstetn77) and (2) for the cognitive theory of time. James Allen&apos;s &amp;quot;Towards a General Theory of Action and 18 Time&amp;quot; (A11en84). 1. SIMPLE PAST E.R_S E_R_S S.R.E E_S.R S_R,E S_E_R In the following, I shall list the main results of this study: 2. PAST PERFECT 1. A better theory of tense with revised primitive tense structures and constraints. 3. SIMPLE PRESENT 4. PRESENT PERFECT 5. SIMPLE FUTURE 6. FUTURE PERFECT 2. We derive an explanation of Hornstein&apos;s Linear Order Constraint, an observed formal constraint on linguistic tense, from properties of the constraint propagation algorithm of Allen&apos;s temporal system. This shows this formal grammatical constraint need not be learned at all. We also show that the rule of R-permanence follows the hypothesis that tne matrix clause and the subcategorizable SCOMP or VCOMP can introduce S and R Finally, we prove that certain boundedness condition on the flow of information of a processing system leads directly to the locality property of a constraint on sequences of tense. 3. A principle of markedness for tense structures based on the computational efficiency of the temporal representation. The principle predicts that (1) of the six basic tenses in English. future perfect is the only marked tense, and (2) the notion of a distant future tense, lust like the simple future, is also unmarked. 4. A better account of the state/event/process distinction based on Allen&apos;s interval-based temporal logic and the idea that the progressive aspect specifies the perspective from which the truth of a situation is evaluated. 5. An account of theoretical constraints on the representation of time at the computational level, e.g.. three distinct time points are necessary to characterize an elementary tensed sentence, and the distinction between instantaneous and non-instantaneous time intervals. 2. Tense We begin by first outlining Hornstein&apos;s theory of tense. In section 2.1. we aescribe the primitives and constraints on tense of In sections 2.2 and 2.3. we show how the pnmitives and constraints can be derived from computational considerations. 2.1 Revisions to Hornstein&apos;s Theory of Tense Hornstein develops a theory of tense within the Reicnenbachian framework which postulates tnree theoretical entities: S (the moment of speech), R (a reference point), and E (the moment of event). The key idea is that certain linear orderings of the three lime points get grammaticalized into the six tenses of English) The following is the list cf structures: Hornstein actually astral none basic tenses. trunk the preoperative belongs the province of aspect than The notation here demands some explanation. The underscore symbol &amp;quot;_&amp;quot; is interpreted as the &amp;quot;less-than&amp;quot; relation among time points whereas the comma symbol &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; stands for the &amp;quot;less-than-or-equal-to&amp;quot; relation. As an illustration, the present perfect tense denotes a situation in which the moment of speech is either cotemporaneous or precedes the reference point, while the moment of event is strictly before the other two moments. Note that Hornstein also uses the term &amp;quot;association&amp;quot; to refer to the comma symbol Given the basic tense structure for a simple tensed sentence, the interpretation of the sentence that arises from the interaction of tense and time adverbs is represented by the modification of the position of the R or E points to form a new tense structure which call derived tense structure. In papers (Hornstein77 &amp; Hornstein81), Hornstein proposes three formal constraints that the class of derived structures generated from the basic tense structures in such a way as to capture the acceptability of sentences containing temporal adverbs (e.g.. now, yesterday, tomorrow). temporal connectives (e.g., when, before, atter), and indirect soeech. In the rest of this section. I shall examine the adeauacy of these constraints. Linear Constraint Order Constraint (LOC) states tnat (p.523-4): (1) The linear oraer of a derived tense structure must be the same the linear oraer of structure. No new association is produced in tense structure. is stipulated to account for examples a temporal adverb such as (4a) and with time such as John came home now, at this very moment H. yesterday iii. *tomorrow 32 a.

John has come home i. ?right now ii. &apos;tomorrow iii. yesterday. predicts (wrongly) that 5cii is good and 5ciii But LOC gives the wrong prediction only on the assumption that the basic tense structures are correct. To account for Sc. I propose to save the LOC and change the following SRE association with the present perfect: PRESENT PERFECT E_FIS With the modified basic tense structure for present perfect. LOC will give the correct analysis. 5cii is bad because: tomorrow E R.S E S R (linear order violated) [1] &apos;John came when we have arrived. [21 John comes when we have arrived. For [lithe new analysis is: E.R S E.R_S 1 E R.S E__R__S which does not violate the RTC and hence predicts (wrongly) that [1] is acceptable. Similarly, for [2], the new analysis is: S.R,E S,R.E (violates RTC) 1 E R . S E S R which predicts (wrongly) that [21 is bad. This may explain why Hornstein decides to use E_S,R for present perfect because it for (11 and no I suggest that the move be abandon RTC which has an asymmetrical property, i.e., it matters put on top, and does not nave an obvious semantic explanation. (See Hornstetn&apos;s footnote 20, p.543). My second proposal is then to replace RTC with a Rule of R.permanence (RP) stating that: Both the S points of and must be any manipulation of the tense structure for 5ciii is acceptable since: yesterday E R .S E R S Thus sentence (31: new linear order and no new comma) [3] John when we had arrived. question that naturally arises at this point is: Why does is acceptable because its tense structure does not violate Hornstein not choose my proposed SPE structure for the present The answer, I believe, will become apparent when we E .R__S (OK: and are examine Hornstem&apos;s second constraint. E R S al ready aligned) 2.1.2 Rule for Temporal Connectives The rule for temporal connectives (RTC) states that (p.539-40): a sentence of the form P where &amp;quot;conn&amp;quot; is a temporal connective such as &amp;quot;when&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;before&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; etc.. line the S points of and P2, that is. write the tense structure and lining up the S points. Move R2 to under placing E2 accorcingiy to preserve LOC on the basic tense structure. car. seen that my proposed tense structure for present let us reconsider sentences [1] and not acceptable under RP and the new tense structure for present perfect since: (violates RP: the two R&apos;s R.5 not aligned) i21 is still a problem. Here I make third namely. that tne simple present tense structures: PRESENT Given this modification. sentence [2] will now be acceptable since: E.R.S (S and R points are aligned) footnote 7 and 11 of Hornstein&apos;s oaper. There may oe doubts as regards the acceptability or scot. An equivalent fonn 5cill is =electable ts Danish Wesoersen65. 0.271). Also. in French, the present can be used for a situation not 24 hours before the present moment (Comne76, 3.61). 20 examine the adequacy of RP. let us look at more examples: [4] John has come when i. we arrived we had arrived we arrive To account for the sequence of tense in reported speech, Hornstein proposes the following rule: . we have arrived arrive For a sentence of the form that assign with iv. V.</abstract>

E R,S (BAD) S R E We can see that the proposed theory correctly predicts all of the is. however, an apparent counter-example to RP which, unlike RTC, is symmetrical. i.e., it does not matter which of the Pi&apos;s is put on the top. Consider the following two sentences: i. John when we arrive. °John arrives when we RP predicts both 5i and 5ii will be unacceptable. but Si seems to be good. It is examples like 5i and 5ii, I believe, that lead Hornstein to propose the asymmetrical rule RTC. But I think the data are misleading because It seems to be an idiosyncrasy of English grammar that 5i is acceptable. In French, we have to say an equivalent of &amp;quot;John will come when we will arrive&amp;quot; with the temporal adverbial explicitly marked with the future tense (Jespersen6.6. p.264). Thus, the acceptability of sentences like 5) can be explained by a principle of Economy of Speech allowing us to omit the future tense of the temporal adverbial if the matrix clause is already marked with the future tense. 2.1.3 Sequences of Tense Now, we describe the third and final grammatical constraint on sequences of tense. Consider the following sentences: John said a week ago that will 3 days. (b) would In the (a) sentence, the temporal interpretation of the embedded sentence S evaluated with respect to the moment of speech. Thus, for instance, [6a] means that Mary&apos;s leaving is 3 days after present moment of speech. On the other hand, the (b) sentence has the temporal interpretation of the embedded sentence evaluated with respect to the interpretation of the matrix clause, i.e., (6b) means that Mary&apos;s leaving is 4 days before the moment of In general, for an n.level embedded sentence. SOT states that: S, with (Hornstein81, p.140). With the SOT rule, [6a1 and (6b) will be analyzed as follows: [6a&apos;] a week ago 1 3 days after SI in three days [60&apos;] a week ago 1 S2__R2.E2 is 4 1 SI in three days local property of SOT, occurs only between and (n-1)th level, has a nice conseouence: it explains third level nested sentence like [7]: said a week ago a) Harry would believe in 3 days b ) that Mary will for London in (c) (ii) would has only two temporal readings: (1) in 7(ci). Mary&apos;s leaving is two after the moment of speech. and 7(cii), Mary&apos;s leaving is two days before the moment of speech. In particular, there is not a temporal reading corresponding to the situation in which Mary&apos;s leaving is five days before the moment of speech. We would obtain the third reading if SOT allowed non-local linking, e.g., with 2.2 Explanations of the Formal Constraints In the previous section, we have examined three formal constraints on the derivation of complex tense structures from the basic tense structures: (1) LOC. (2) RP, and (3) SOT. Now, I want show how the LOC falls out naturally from properties of a temporal reasoning system along the line suggested by Allen (Allen84, Allen83), and also how the RP and have intuitive computational motivation. The basis of Allen&apos;s computational system is a temporal logic based on intervals instead of time points. The temporal logic consists of seven basic relations and their inverses (A11en84, p.129, figure 1): 21 Relation ;ymbol meaning inverse Y ( &gt; XXX YYY X equal Y . = XXX YYY X meets Y in mi XXXYYY X overlaps Y o oi XXX YYY X during Y d di XXX YYYYY X starts Y s si XXX YYYY X finishes Y f fi XXX YYYY reasoning scheme form of constraint propagation in a network of event nodes linked by temporal relationships. For instance, the situation as described in the sentence &amp;quot;John arrived when we came&amp;quot; is represented by the network: -- ( ) &lt; mi =) --&gt; 8 N Z ( &lt; ) ( &lt; ) e NOW where A John&apos;s arrival and 8 Our coming network means that both event A and are before the moment of speech, while A can be before, after or simultaneous with B. When new temporal relationships are added, the system maintains consistency among events by propagating the effects of new relationships via a of Transitivity Relationships tells the system how to deduce the set of admissible relationships between events A and C given the relationships between A and B, and between B and C. Thus, for instance, from the relationships &amp;quot;A during B&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;B &lt; C&amp;quot;, the system can deduce &amp;quot;A &lt;C&amp;quot;. One property of the constraint propagation algorithm generally is that further information only causes removal of members from the set of admissible labels, i.e., temporal between any two old events (A11en83. p.835). can be added to the admissible set once it is created. us call property the constraint propagation algorithm tne Delete Label Condition (DLC). DLC can be interpreted as a kind of information monotonicity condition on the temporal representation. Let us further restrict Allen&apos;s temporal logic to Instantaneous intervals. i.e.. each event corresponds to a single moment of time. The restricted logic has only one primitive relation, and three other derived relations: &lt;, &gt;, and &gt;. There is a straightforward translation of Hornstein&apos;s SRE notation into the network representation, namely, replace each comma symbol &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; by &lt; (or &gt; with the event symbols reverse their roles) and each unaerscore symbol &amp;quot;_&amp;quot; by &gt; (or &lt; with similar adjustment on the symbols). Thus, a tense structure such E_R,S represented as: representation scheme, we can prove the following theorem: (Ti) DLC LOC and B range over ( S. R. E) and A B. There are five types 01 violations of the A_B 2. A_B A.B 3. A_B B.A 4. A.B B,A 5. A,B B_A We can see that each of these cases is a violation of the DLC. To spell this out. we have the following operations on the constraint corresponding to the above violations of the 2&apos;. A -(&lt;)-&gt;8 A .( &lt; =)•&gt;I3 3&apos;. A •( &lt; )•) —• A .( &gt; 4&apos;. A •( &lt; = ).) B -( &gt; = 5&apos;. A .(/.. = )•&gt; —.A .()).&gt;B each these cases. the operation Involves the addition of members to the admissible set. This is ruled out by PLC. Thus, we have the result that if LOC is violated, then ()LC is violated. In words. PLC The second constraint to be accounted for is the RP which effectively states that (a) the S points of the matrix clause and the temporal adverbial must be identical. and (b) the R points of the matrix clause and the temporal adverbial must be identical. One hypothesis for this rule is that: (H1) Only the matrix clause introduces distinct S and R points. In other words, the non-subcategorizable temporal adjuncts do not add new S and R points. H1 has to be modified slightly to take the case of embedded sentence into account, namely, (Revised RP): Only the matrix clause and the subcategorizable SCOMP or VCOMP can introduce distinct S and R points. where SCOMP and VCOMP stand for sentential complement and converse oveorem not 22 verbal complement respectively. The interesting point is that both Let us recall our restrictive temporal logic of instantaneous the revised RP and the locality properly of SOT can be easily interval with one primitive relation, &lt;, and three derived relations: &lt; implemented in processing systems which have certain , &gt;, and &gt;. Represent a SRE configuration as follows: on the phrase structure rules (e.g., information cannot move across more than one bounding node). S E To illustrate this, let us consider the following tense interpretation rules embedded in the phrase structure rules of the Lexical-Functional Grammar: The admissible labels are among ( (, &lt;= &gt;. &gt;, &gt; = ). So there are altogether 64 possible configurations that can be classified into</abstract>

Thus, in this way, the second effect accomplishes what the SOT rule demands. Implications If the revisions to Hornstein&apos;s theory of tense are correct, the natural question to oe asked is: How do speakers attain such knowledge? This question has two parts: (1) How do speakers acquire the formal constraints on SRE derivation? and (2) How do speakers learn to associate the appropriate SRE structures with the basic tenses of the language? (3) Label ings that are consistent and the SE link is constrained by the SR and RE link (16). e.g.. If we assume that labefings of the third type correspond to the unmarked SRE configurations, the following division of unmarked and marked configurations is obtained: us consider the first sub-question. In the case of LOC. MARKED we have a neat answer the constraint need NOT be learned at all! We have shown that LOC falls out naturally as a consequence of the architecture and processing algorithm of the computational system. As regards the constraint RP. the learner has to acquire something similar to HI. But HI is a fairly simple hypothesis that does not seem to require induction on extensive linguistic data. Finally, as we have shown in the previous section, the of flow information of a processing system leads directly to he locality property of the SOT. The particular linking of S and E points as stipulated by the SOT, however, is a parameter of the Universal Grammar that has to be fixed. What about the second sub-question? How do speakers learn to pair SRE configurations with the basic tenses? There are 24 possible SRE configurations seven of which get grammaticalized. Here I want to propose a principle of markedness of SRE structures that has a natural computational motivation. There are only eight unmarked tense structures corresponding to the sixteen SRE network configurations of type 3</abstract>

This agrees largely with our pretheoretical intuition that the SRE configurations that to the basic tenses should be &amp;quot;unmarked&amp;quot; than SRE configurations. The fit, however, is not exact because the future perfect tense becomes the marked tense in this classification. Another prediction by this principle of markedness is that both the simple future (S_R,E) and distant future (S_R_E) are It would to find out whether there are which the distant future actually gets grammaticalized. The final point to be made is about the second type of labelings. There are two other possible ways of grouping the (1) given SR and SE. those labelings in is and SE and RE, those in which SR is But these grouping are less likely because would simple present tense as a marked tense. they can be ruled out by relatively data. 3. Verb Aspect In considering the problem of tense, we have restricted ourselves to a subset of Allen*s temporal logic, namely, using a structure linear ordering of time points. To make use of the full power of Allen&apos;s temporal logic, we now turn to the problem of verb aspect. The two main problems ot the study of verb aspect are the characterization 01 three fundamental types of verb predication according to the situation types that they signify -process and event. and perspectives from is viewed, or its evaluated simple or the first of his paper. Allen attempts to provide a formal account of the state/process/event distinction using a temporal logic. However. I believe that his characterization fails to capture of tense implications, and not make the situation types and perspective types to any adequate account of In the next I °resent data that any theory of verb aspect must be able to explain. of the oetter works C,onme713. Mourelatos78. 3.1.1 Tense Implications Statives rarely take the progressive , I know the answer. 9 am knowing the answer. 2. For verb predications denoting processes, the progressive of the verb form entails the perfect form, i.e., x is V-ing x has V-ed. For instance, John is walking John has walked. 3. For verb predications denoting events, the progressive of the the negation of perfect form, i.e., V-ing x not V-ed. For instance, John is building a house — John has not built the house. 3.1.2 Sentences containing When containing clauses connected by such as &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; have different aspect interpretations depending the types and perspective types involved. John laughed drew circle. /Perroective X = crocess/simple: Y = event/simple Interpretation: can pet ore. atter or simultaneous with Y Ann was laugning drew circle. = progressive: Y = event/simple Interpretation: occurs during X. angry when Mary drew a circle. Situation /Perspective type: = state/simole: = event/simple Interoretntion: can be before. after, simultaneous or during Y. John was when Mary was drawing a circle. = crocess/progressive: = must be with Y. Formal of the State/Process/Event distinction Define: has often pointed ow some statnes do tete the OrogrellSfee 1 maikong the exam.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The doctor is seeing a However, a statistical study hes shown that the familiar statwes rarely occur with the aspect -- *es at (0ta63. section 24 (a)XCV•-•Xd`O/XsYVICY (b)XCV.-.XCYVXequalY (c) mom(t) 4-• t is an instantaneous interval, i.e., consists of a single moment of time per(t) ••• t is a non-instantaneous where X and Y are generic symbols denoting state, event or process. 3.2.1 Progressive OCCUR(PROG(v,t)) •-• mom(t) A —1OCCUR(v,t) A (3 d t&apos; A The progressive aspect is the evaluation of a situation from an of the situation which has the property that though sentence is at that instantaneous interval, it is true in a non-instantaneous interval t properly containing t. 3.2.2 State (SI): OCCUR(s.t) •-• (V t&apos;)(mom(r) A t&apos; C t OCCUR(s.t&apos;)) A state verb is true at every instantaneous interval of t. The definition is similar to Allen&apos;s H.1 (Allen84, p.130). The following theorem shows that state verbs do not occur with the progressive aspect. (S-THEOREM): &apos;OCCUR(PROG(s.0) Proof OCCUR(PROG(5.0) -• mom(t) A OCCUR(s.t) A (3 t&apos;)(t d t&apos; A OCCUR(s.t&apos;)) for some t containing t OCCUR(s.t) (by Si) • contradiction. —i This theorem raises the following question: Why do some statives occur with the progressive? I thinx there are two answers. First, the verb in question may have a use other than the stative use (e.g. &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; is a stative when it means &amp;quot;possession&amp;quot;. and not stative when it means &amp;quot;experiencing&amp;quot; as in &amp;quot;John is good time in Paris.&amp;quot;) Second. the English progressive may have a second meaning in addition to that cnaractenzed by PROG above. A frecuent usage of the progressive is to indicate snort duration or temporariness. e.g., in &amp;quot;They are living in Cambridge&apos; /&amp;quot;They live in Cambridge&amp;quot;. 8. This section benefits from the insights of Barry Taylor fraylorT7). 9 reviewer of this paper points out that me nPOO axiom seems to imply Plat if something is in progress. it murit complete. Thus. if Max is drawing a circle, then at some future time. ne must have arawn the circle. This inference is &apos;Pearly false mere is notrung contraoictory about drawing a circle Out he never orew it.&amp;quot; For instance. Max mem sueer a heart attack and Med suddenly. Thus imertrice problem of ine progressive form of a event verb is known as the °moor in literature One way out is to deny Max realty a circle yawn he died Rather drawing something would Owen he This type of analysis would involve some World semantics. 3.2.3 Process A process verb can be true only at an interval larger than a smgle moment. This property differs crucially from that of the statives. (P1): OCCUR(p,t) Per(t) (P2): OCCUR(p,t) (V r)(per(r) A t&apos; C t OCCUR(p,t&apos;)) The following theorem shows that for a process verb, the progressive verb form entails the perfect form. (P-THEOREM) OCCUR(PROG(p.t)) (3 t&apos;)(per(t&apos;) A t&apos;( t A lacagi OCCUR(PROG(p,t)) A —1OCCUR(p,t) A (3 t&apos;)(t d t&apos; A OCCUR(p.t&apos;)) OCCUR(p,t&apos;) for some t&apos; such that t d t&apos; 3 E &lt; t (since t d 3 E t&apos;. &lt; t (by density of time points) Let t&amp;quot; be the interval 1m1 .m21. Then. we have t&amp;quot; &lt;t and t&amp;quot; C t&apos;. By (P2), we have OCCUR(p,t&amp;quot;). That is. p has occurred. —I. The characterization of process verb by Allen (his 0.2) is less satisfactory because It combines both the notion of progressive (his &amp;quot;OCCURRING&amp;quot;) the vero Into the same axiom. Furthermore, the difference between tne predicate is not acteauately explained in his paper. 3.2.4 Event An event verb shares an important properly with a process verb, namely. it can be true only at a non instantaneous interval. (El). OCCURIe.t) per(t) (E2)• OCCUR(e.0 — (V t&apos;)(per(t&apos;) A t&apos; C t OCCUR(e,r) The following theorem shows that the progressive form of an event verb entails the negation of the perfect form. OCCUR(PROG(e.t)) — r)(per(r) A t&apos;&lt; t A OCCUR(e.t&apos;)) Proof As in the proof of (P•THEOREN1). we can find a non-instantaneous interval t&amp;quot; such that t&amp;quot; (I and t&amp;quot; C t&apos; But tor any such t&amp;quot;, we have OCCUR(e.t&amp;quot;) because of (E2). That is. it cannot be the that e has occurred. —I. Again the crucial property (El) is not captured by Allen&apos;s characterization of events (his 0.1). on temporal interpretations involving When account for the variety aspect interpretations in section I the following constraint on 25 situation/perspective type: constraints, such as the Linear Order Constraint on tense, fall out naturally as a consequence of some computational assumptions. (C-ASPECT): Let &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; stand for a process or event. The interesting result is that this formal constraint need not be learned at all. (a) simple/dynamic mom(t) (b) simple/state per(t) (c) progressive/dynamic per(t) A C Perspective is a way of looking at the situation type. For process or event, the simple aspect treats the situation as an instantaneous interval even though the situation itself may not be instantaneous. For state. the simple aspect retains its duration. The progressive aspect essentially views a process or event from its interior, thus requiring a stance in which the situation is a non-instantaneous interval and the admissible temporal to be the C relations, i.e., si, t, ti, d, di, Let me show graphically how C.ASPECT accounts for the aspect interpretations of sentences (91 to 021. [9&apos;] simple/process WHEN simple/event Admissible relations: mi X Y XV X YX Another important role of a representation scheme in explaining phenomena that exist on a entirely different -• linguistic -level is illustrated by the formulation of the C-ASPECT constraint to account for interpretations of sentences containing temporal connectives. The study of linguistic semantics also sheds light on a representation of time by revealing the fundamental distinctions that must be made. e.g.. a tensed sentence involves three distinct time points, and the aspectual interpretations require instantaneous/non-instantaneous interval distinction.
