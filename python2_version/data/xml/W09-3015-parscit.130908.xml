Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923368421053">
Corpus annotation plays an important
role in linguistic analysis and computa-
tional processing of both written and
spoken language. Syntactic annotation
of spoken texts becomes clearly a topic
of considerable interest nowadays,
driven by the desire to improve auto-
matic speech recognition systems by
incorporating syntax in the language
models, or to build language under-
standing applications. Syntactic anno-
tation of both written and spoken texts
in the Czech Academic Corpus was
created thirty years ago when no other
(even annotated) corpus of spoken texts
has existed. We will discuss how much
relevant and inspiring this annotation is
to the current frameworks of spoken
text annotation.

1 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999848295454546">
The purpose of annotating corpora is to cre-
ate an objective evidence of the real usage
of the language. In general, it is easier to anno-
tate written text – speech must be recorded and
transcribed to process it whilst texts are avail-
able “immediately”; moreover, written texts
usually obey standard grammar rules of the
language in questions, while a true transcript of
spoken utterances often does not.
The theoretical linguistic research considers
the language to be a system of layers
(e.g. the Government and Binding theory
(Chomsky, 1993), the Functional-Generative
Description of the language (Sgall, Hajičová,
Panevová 1986)). In order to be a valuable
source of linguistic knowledge, the corpus an-
notation should respect this point of view.
The morphological and syntactic layers
of annotation represent a standard in today’s
text corpora, e.g. the Penn Treebank,
the family of the Prague Dependency Tree-
banks, the Tiger corpus for German, etc. Some
corpora contain a semantic annotation, such as
the Penn Treebank enriched by PropBank and
Nombank, the Prague Dependency Treebank in
its highest layer, the Penn Chinese or the
the Korean Treebanks. The Penn Discourse
Treebank contains discourse annotation.
It is desirable that syntactic (and higher) an-
notation of spoken texts respects the written-
text style as much as possible, for obvious rea-
sons: data “compatibility”, reuse of tools etc.
A number of questions arise immediately:
How much experience and knowledge ac-
quired during the written text annotation can
we apply to the spoken texts? Are the annota-
tion instructions applicable to transcriptions in
a straightforward way or some modifications
of them must be done? Can transcriptions be
annotated “as they are” or some transformation
of their inner structure into a written text struc-
ture must precede the annotation? The Czech
Academic Corpus will help us to find out the
answers.

2 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999862923076923">
The first attempts to syntactically annotate
spoken texts date back to the 1970s and 1980s
when the Czech Academic Corpus – CAC
(Králík, Uhlířová, 2007) and the Swedish Tal-
banken (Nilsson, Hall, Nivre, 2005) appeared.
Talbanken was annotated with partial phrase
structures and grammatical functions, CAC
with dependency-based structures and analyti-
cal functions. Thus both corpora can be re-
garded as belonging to the pioneers in corpus
linguistics, together with the paper-only “Quirk
corpus” (Svartvik, Quirk, 1980; computerized
later as the London-Lund Corpus).1

During the last twenty years the work on
creating new treebanks has increased consid-
erably and so CAC and Talbanken have been
put in a different light, namely with regard to
their internal formats and annotation schemes.
Given that, transformation of them became
necessary: while the Talbanken’s transforma-
tion concerned only the internal format, trans-
formation of CAC concerned both internal for-
mat and annotation scheme.
Later, more annotated corpora of spoken
texts have appeared, like the British Compo-
nent of the International Corpus of English
(ICE-GB, Greenbaum, 1996), the Fisher Cor-
pus for English (Cieri et al., 2004), the Childes
database 2, the Switchboard part of the Penn
Treebank (Godfrey et al., 1992), Corpus
Gesproken Nederlands (Hoekstra et al., 2001)
and the Verbmobil corpora.3 The syntactic an-
notation in these corpora is mostly automatic
using tools trained on written corpora or on a
small, manually annotated part of spoken cor-
pora.
The aim of our contribution is to answer
the question whether it is possible to annotate
speech transcriptions syntactically according to
the guidelines originally designed for text cor-
pora. We will show the problems that arise in
extending an explicit scheme of syntactic an-
notation of written Czech into the domain of
spontaneous speech (as found in the CAC).
Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 3, we give a brief description of the past
and present of the Czech Academic Corpus.
The compatibility of the original CAC syntac-
tic annotation with a present-day approach
adopted by the Prague Dependency Treebank
project is evaluated in Section 4. Section 5 is
the core of our paper. We discuss phenomena
typical for spoken texts making impossible to
annotate them according to the guidelines for
written texts. We explore a trade-off between
leaving the original annotation aside and anno-
tating from scratch, and an upgrade of the
original annotation. In addition, we briefly
compare the approach adopted for Czech and
those adopted for other languages.

<bodyText confidence="0.999494596153846">
The idea of the Czech Academic Corpus
(CAC) came to life between 1971 and 1985
thanks to the Department of Mathematical
Linguistics within the Institute of Czech Lan-
guage. The discussion on the concept of aca-
demic grammar of Czech, i.e. on the concept
of CAC annotation, finally led to the tradi-
tional, systematic, and well elaborated concept
of morphology and dependency syntax (Šmi-
lauer, 1972). By the mid 1980s, a total of
540,000 words of CAC were morphologically
and syntactically manually annotated.
The documents originally selected for the
CAC are articles taken from a range of media.
The sources included newspapers and maga-
zines, and transcripts of spoken language from
radio and TV programs, covering administra-
tive, journalistic and scientific fields.
The original CAC was on par with it peers at
the time (such as the Brown corpus) in size,
coverage, and annotation; it surpassed them in
that it contained (some) syntactic annotation.
CAC was used in the first experiments of sta-
tistical morphological tagging of Czech (Hajič,
Hladká, 1997).
After the Prague Dependency Treebank
(PDT) has been built (Hajič et al., 2006), a
conversion from the CAC to the PDT format
has started. The PDT uses three layers of anno-
tation: morphological, syntactic and “tecto-
grammatical” (or semantic) layers (henceforth
m-layer, a-layer and t-layer, respectively).
The main goal was to make the CAC and the
PDT compatible at the m-layer and the a-layer,
and thus to enable integration of the CAC into
the PDT. The second version of the CAC pre-
sents such a complete conversion of the inter-
nal format and the annotation schemes. The
overall statistics on the CAC 2.0 are presented
in Table 1.
Annotation transformation is visualized in
Figure 1. In the areas corresponding to the cor-
pora, the morphological annotation is symbol-
ized by the horizontal lines and syntactical an-
notation by the vertical lines.
Conversion of the originally simple textual
comma-separated values format into the Pra-
gue Markup Language (Pajas, Štěpánek, 2005)
was more or less straightforward.
Morphological analysis of Czech in the
CAC and in the PDT is almost the same, ex-
cept that the morphological tagset of CAC is
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999604">
slightly more detailed. Semi-automatic conver-
sion of the original morphological annotation
into the Czech positional morphological tagset
was executed in compliance with the morpho-
logical annotation of PDT (Hana et al., 2005).
Figure 1 shows that morphological annotation
conversion of both written and spoken texts
was done.
The only major problem in this conversion
was that digit-only tokens and punctuation
were omitted from the original CAC since they
were deemed linguistically “uninteresting”,
which is certainly true from the point of view
of the original CAC’s purpose to give quantita-
tive lexical support to a new Czech dictionary.
Since the sources of the CAC documents were
no longer available, missing tokens had to in-
serted and revised manually.
Syntactic conversion of CAC was more de-
manding than the morphological one. In a pilot
study, (Ribarov et al., 2006) attempt to answer
a question whether an automatic transforma-
tion of the CAC annotation into the PDT for-
mat (and subsequent manual corrections) is
more effective than to leave the CAC annota-
tion aside and process the CAC’s texts by a
statistical parser instead (again, with subse-
quent manual correction). In the end, the latter
variant was selected (with regrets). No distinc-
tion in strategy of written and spoken texts an-
notation transformation was made. However,
spoken texts were eventually excluded from
the CAC 2.0 (Figure 1). Reasons for this are
explained in detail in the following two sec-
tions.

<bodyText confidence="0.976439142857143">
The syntactic analysis of Czech in the CAC
and in the PDT is very much alike, but there
are phenomena in which the CAC syntactic
annotation scenario differs from the PDT, even
though both corpora are based on the same
linguistic theory (Šmilauer, 1969), i.e. on the
dependency grammar notion common to the
“Prague school” of linguists since the 1930s.
However, the syntactic annotation differs
between the two corpora. The CAC works with
a single syntactic layer, whereas the PDT
works with two independent (although inter-
linked) syntactic layers: an analytical (syntac-
tic) one and a tectogrammatical one (a-layer
and t-layer, respectively). In this paper, we are
referring to the a-layer of the PDT in our com-
parisons unless specifically noted for those
elements of the tectogrammatical annotation
that do have some counterpart in the CAC.

The CAC annotation scheme makes a sub-
stantial distinction between two things: surface
syntactic relations within a single clause as
well as syntactic relations between clauses in a
complex sentence. These two types of syntac-
tic information are captured by two types of
syntactic tags.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988229166666667">
(a) Word-level (intra-clausal) syntactic tag is

token of each clause in a complex sen-
tence, representing the status (and possi-

The CAC thus annotates not only depend-
ency relations within a single clause but also
dependency relations within a complex sen-
tence.
A description of the 6-position and the 8-
position tags is given in Tables 2 and 3, respec-
tively. (Ribarov et al., 2006) gives a detailed
description.

4.2 Syntactic annotation in the PDT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985075">
The PDT a-layer annotates two main things:
a dependency structure of the sentence and
types of these dependencies.
Representation of a structure of the sentence
is rendered in a form of a dependency tree, the
nodes of which correspond to the tokens
(words and punctuation) that form the sen-
tence. The type of dependency (subject, object,
adverbial, complement, attribute, etc.) is repre-
sented by a node attribute called an “analytical
function” (afun for short; the most frequent
values of this attribute are listed in Table 4).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985976">
4.3 CAC vs. PDT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98974605">
Comparing the CAC and the PDT syntactic
annotation scenarios, we can see that the anno-
tation of the major syntactic relations within a
sentence is very similar, from similar adapta-
tions of the theoretical background down to the
high-level corpus markup conventions. For
example, in both corpora the predicate is the
clausal head and the subject is its dependent,
unlike the descriptions we can find in the tradi-
tional Czech syntactic theory (Šmilauer, 1969).
Another (technical) similarity can be found in
the way the dependency types are encoded. In
both corpora, the dependency type label is
stored at the dependent. No confusion arises
since the link from a dependent to its governor
is unique.
However, the list of differences is actually
quite long. Some are minor and technical: for
example, in the PDT an “overarching” root of
the sentence tree (marked AuxS) is always
added, so that all other nodes appear as if they
depend on it. Some differences are more pro-
found and are described below.
We are not going to list all the differences in
individual syntactic labels - they can be found
easily by confronting Tables 2 and 4, but we
would like to draw the readers’ attention to the
main dissimilarities between the CAC’s and
the PDT’s syntactic annotation scenarios.
Punctuation
The first difference can be observed at first
glance: in CAC no punctuation marks can be
found (as mentioned in Section 3). While some
might question whether punctuation should
ever be part of syntax, in computational ap-
proaches punctuation is certainly seen as a
very important part of written-language syntax
and is thus taken into account in annotation
(for important considerations about punctua-
tion in spoken corpora, see Section 5).
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.646309" genericHeader="method">
Digits
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999815333333333">
CAC leaves out digital tokens, even though
they are often a valid part of the syntactic
structure and can plausibly get various syntac-
tic labels as we can see in the PDT annotation,
where nothing is left out of the syntactic tree
structure.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.346628">
Prepositions and function words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931785714286">
The next most significant difference is in the
treatment of prepositions (or function words in
general, see also the next paragraphs on con-
junctions and other auxiliaries). Whereas CAC
neither labels them nor even includes them in
the dependency tree, PDT at the a-layer, re-
flecting the surface shape of the sentence,
makes them the head of the autosemantic
nodes they “govern” (and labels them with the
AuxP analytical function tag). The CAC way
of annotation (rather, non-annotation) of
prepositions is, in a sense, closer to the annota-
tion scenario of the underlying syntactic layer
(the t-layer) of the PDT, It is also reflected in
the adverbial types of labels (column 2 in Ta-
ble 2) – these would all be labeled only as Adv
at the (surface-syntactic) a-layer of the PDT,
but at the (deep) t-layer, they get a label from a
mix of approx. 70 functional, syntactic and
semantic labels. Unfortunately, only seven
such labels are used in the CAC, resulting in
loss of information in some cases (adverbials
of aim, accompaniment, attitude, beneficiary,
etc.); the same is true for certain subtypes of
time and location adverbials, since they are not
distinguished in terms of direction, location
designation (on/under/above/next to and many
other), duration, start time vs. end time, etc.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.592153" genericHeader="method">
Conjunctions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998063666666667">
Further, subordinating as well as coordinat-
ing conjunctions get only a sentential syntactic
tag in the CAC (if any), i.e. they are labeled by
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994566">
93
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.985583694444444">
the 9-position tag but not by the word-level,
intra-clausal syntactic tag. In PDT, subordinat-
ing and coordinating conjunctions get assigned
the analytical function value AuxC and Co-
ord, respectively, and they are always in-
cluded in the syntactic tree. For subordinating
conjunctions, the CAC approach is again in
some ways similar to the annotation scenario
of the tectogrammatical layer of PDT – de-
pendencies between clauses are annotated but
the set of labels is much smaller than that of t-
layer of the PDT, again resulting in a loss of
information. For coordination and apposition,
the difference is structural; while CAC marks
an a coordination element with a specific label
(value ‘1’ in the column 6 of a word-level tag
and the same value in column 8 of the clause-
level tag, see Tables 2 and 3), PDT makes a
node corresponding to the coordination (appo-
sition) a virtual head of the members of the
coordination or apposition (whether phrasal or
clausal). CAC thus cannot annotate hierarchy
in coordination and apposition without another
loss of information, while PDT can.
Reflexive particles
In CAC, reflexive particles se/si are often left
unannotated, while PDT uses detailed labels
for all occurrences. Lexicalized reflexives
(AuxT in the PDT), particles (AuxO) and re-
flexive passivization (AuxR) and also certain
(yet rare) adverbial usages (Adv) are not anno-
tated in the CAC at all. The only case where
CAC annotates them is in situations where
they can be considered objects (accusative or
dative case of the personless reflexive pronoun
sebe).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.669848">
Analytic verb forms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999392">
In CAC, no syntactic relation is indicated for
auxiliary verbs, loosing the reference to the
verb they belong to; in the PDT, they are put as
dependents onto their verb, and labeled AuxV
to describe their function.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.667303">
Special adverbs and particles

<bodyText confidence="0.999959333333333">
In PDT, there are also syntactic labels for
certain type of “special” adverbials and parti-
cles, such as raději [better], zřejmě [probably],
také [also], přece [surely], jedině [only]. In
CAC, dependencies and syntactic tags for
these tokens are missing.
Other differences in both syntactic scenarios
will be described in the next section since they

5 CAC syntactic annotation of spoken
utterances
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999846285714286">
Current Czech syntactic theory is based al-
most entirely on written Czech but spoken lan-
guage often differs strikingly from the written
one (Müllerová, 1994).
In the CAC guidelines, only the following
word-level markup specifically aimed at the
spoken utterance structure is described:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9996612">
• non-identical reduplication of a word
(value ‘7’ in column 6),
• identical reduplication of a word (value
‘8’ in column 6),
• ellipsis (value ‘9’ or ‘0’ in column 6).
</listItem>
<construct confidence="0.976793833333333">
Let’s take this spoken utterance from CAC:
CZ: A to jsou trošku, jedna je, jedna má světlou
budovu a druhá má tmavou budovu, ony jsou umís-
těny v jednom, v jednom areále, ale ta, to centrum,
patřilo té, bylo to v bloku Univerzity vlámské, a já
jsem se ptala na univerzitě, na, v Univerzitě svo-
bodné, že, no a to přeci oni nevědí, to nanejvýš, to
prostě jedině, když je to Univerzita vlámská, tak o
tom oni přece nemohou nic vědět, a nic.
(Lit.: And they are a bit, one is, one has a light
building and the second has a dark building, they
are placed in one, in one campus, but the, the cen-
ter, it belonged to the, it was in a bloc of the Flem-
ish University, and I asked at the University, in, at
the Free University, that, well, and that surely they
don’t know, it at most, it simply only, if it is the
Flemish University, so they surely cannot know
anything, and nothing.)
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.999899941176471">
Words jsou [are] and ta [the] represent a non-
identical reduplication of a word; that is why
they have been assigned the value ‘7’ (as de-
scribed above), while je [is], jednom [one], to
[the] and nic [nothing] represent an identical
reduplication of a word, i.e. they get the value
‘8’ (“identical reduplication of a word”). The
description does not quite correspond to what a
closer look at the data reveals: ‘7’ is used to
mark a reparandum (part of the sentence that
was corrected by the speaker later), while ‘8’ is
used to mark the part that replaces the reparan-
dum (cf. also the “EDITED” nonterminal and
the symbols “[“, “+” and “\” in the Penn Tree-
bank Switchboard annotation (Godfrey et al.,
1992). Ellipsis (the value ‘9’) was assigned to
the words trošku [a bit] and té [to the].
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998647">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.981021447916667">
However, our sample sentence contains
more phenomena typical for spoken language
than CAC attempts to annotate, for example:
- unfinished sentences (fragments), with
apparent ellipsis: A to je trošku... [And
they are a bit...],
- false beginnings (restarts): jedna je,
jedna má [one is, one has],
- repetition of words in the middle
of sentence: jsou umísteny v jednom,
jednom areále [they are placed in one, in
one campus],
- redundant and ungrammatically used
words: ony jsou umísteny v jednom...,
univerzite, na,v Univerzite svobodné,...
[, they are placed in one... at the Univer-
sity, in, at the Free University, ],
- redundant deictic words: ...ale ta, to cen-
trum... [...but the, the center...],
- intonation fillers: no [well],
- question tags: na Univerzite svobodné,
že [at the Free University, that],
- redundant conectors: když je to Uni-
verzita vlámská, tak to o tom [if it is the
Flemish University, so they surely can-
not know anything],
- broken coherence of utterance, „teared“
syntactic scheme of proposition: ale ta,
to centrum, bylo to v bloku [but the, the
center, it belonged to the, it was in a
bloc],
- syntactic errors, anacoluthon: preci
nemohu nic vedet, a nic. [surely (I) can-
not know anything, and nothing].
The CAC syntactic scenario does not cover
these phenomena in the guidelines (and tag
tables), and even if some of them would easily
fall in the reparandum/repair category (such as
the phrase jedna je, jedna má [one is, one
has]), which is seemingly included, it does not
annotate them as such. Moreover, these are just
some of the spoken language phenomena,
taken from just one random utterance; a thor-
ough look at the spoken part of the CAC re-
veals that most of the well-known spoken lan-
guage phenomena, e.g. grammatically incoher-
ent utterances, grammatical additions spoken
as an afterthought, redundant co-references or
phrase-connecting errors (Shriver, 1994, Fitz-
gerald, 2009), are present in the texts but left
unnoticed.
In comparison, however, the PDT covers
none of these typical spoken structures in the
text annotation guidelines (the main reason
being that it does not contain spoken material
in the first place). Thus, at the surface-
syntactic layer (the a-layer) of the PDT, there
are only limited means for capturing such spo-
ken phenomena.
For example, words playing the role of fill-
ers could get the analytical function AuxO de-
signed mostly for a redundant (deictic or emo-
tive) constituent.
Many phenomena typical for spoken lan-
guage would get, according to the PDT guide-
lines, the analytical function ExD (Ex-
Dependent), which just “warns” of such type
of incomplete utterance structure where a gov-
erning word is missing, i.e. it is such ellipsis
where the dependent is present but its govern-
ing element is not.
In Figure 2, we present an attempt to anno-
tate the above spoken utterance using the stan-
dard PDT guidelines. The “problematic”
nodes, for which we had to adopt some arbi-
trary annotation decisions due to the lack of
proper means in the PDT annotation guide-
lines, are shown as dark squares. For compari-
son, we have used dashed line for those de-
pendency edges that were annotated in the

tags (values ‘7’, ‘8’, ‘9’ in the column 6 of the
original annotation, see above at the beginning
of Sect. 5),
Most of the square-marked nodes do corre-
spond well to the PDT labels for special cases
which are used for some of the peripheral lan-
guage phenomena (ExD, Apos and its mem-
bers, several AuxX for extra commas, AuxY
for particles etc.).
It can also be observed that the dashed lines
(CAC spoken annotation labels) correspond to
some of the nodes with problematic markup in
the PDT, but they are used only in clear cases
and therefore they are found much more spar-
ingly in the corpus.

<bodyText confidence="0.9979492">
Courage of the original CAC project’s team
deserves to be reminded. Having the experi-
ence with the present spoken data processing,
we do appreciate the initial attempts with the
syntactic annotation of spoken texts.

Given the main principles of the a-layer of
PDT annotation (no addition/deletion of to-
kens, no word-order changes, no word correc-
tions), one would have to introduce arbitrary,
linguistically irrelevant rules for spoken mate-
rial annotation with a doubtful use even if ap-
plied consistently to the corpus. Avoiding that,
transcriptions currently present in the CAC
could not be syntactically annotated using
the annotation guidelines of the PDT.
However, in the future, we plan to complete
the annotation of the spoken language tran-
scriptions, using the scheme of the so-called
“speech reconstruction” project (Mikulová et
al., 2008), running now within the framework
of the PDT (for both Czech and English)5. This
project will enable to use the text-based guide-
lines for syntactic annotation of spoken mate-
rial by introducing a separate layer
of annotation, which allows for “editing” of the
original transcript and transforming it thus into
a grammatical, comprehensible text. The “ed-
ited” layer is in addition to the original tran-
script and contains explicit links between them
at the word granularity, allowing in turn for
observations of the relation between the origi-
nal transcript and its syntactic annotation
(made “through” the edited text) without any
loss. The scheme picks up the threads of the
speech reconstruction approach developed for
English by Erin Fitzgerald (Fitzgerald, Jelinek,
2008). Just for a comparison see our sample
sentence (analyzed in Sect. 5) transformed into
a reconstructed sentence (The bold marking
means changes, and parentheses indicate ele-
ments left out in the reconstructed sentence.).

<abstract confidence="0.994525876923077">Corpus annotation plays an important role in linguistic analysis and computational processing of both written and spoken language. Syntactic annotation of spoken texts becomes clearly a topic of considerable interest nowadays, driven by the desire to improve automatic speech recognition systems by incorporating syntax in the language models, or to build language understanding applications. Syntactic annotation of both written and spoken texts in the Czech Academic Corpus was created thirty years ago when no other (even annotated) corpus of spoken texts has existed. We will discuss how much relevant and inspiring this annotation is to the current frameworks of spoken text annotation. 1 Motivation The purpose of annotating corpora is to create an objective evidence of the real usage of the language. In general, it is easier to annotate written text – speech must be recorded and transcribed to process it whilst texts are available “immediately”; moreover, written texts usually obey standard grammar rules of the language in questions, while a true transcript of spoken utterances often does not. The theoretical linguistic research considers the language to be a system of layers (e.g. the Government and Binding theory (Chomsky, 1993), the Functional-Generative of the language (Sgall, Panevová 1986)). In order to be a valuable source of linguistic knowledge, the corpus annotation should respect this point of view. The morphological and syntactic layers of annotation represent a standard in today’s text corpora, e.g. the Penn Treebank, the family of the Prague Dependency Treebanks, the Tiger corpus for German, etc. Some corpora contain a semantic annotation, such as the Penn Treebank enriched by PropBank and Nombank, the Prague Dependency Treebank in its highest layer, the Penn Chinese or the the Korean Treebanks. The Penn Discourse Treebank contains discourse annotation. It is desirable that syntactic (and higher) annotation of spoken texts respects the writtentext style as much as possible, for obvious reasons: data “compatibility”, reuse of tools etc. A number of questions arise immediately: How much experience and knowledge acquired during the written text annotation can we apply to the spoken texts? Are the annotation instructions applicable to transcriptions in a straightforward way or some modifications of them must be done? Can transcriptions be annotated “as they are” or some transformation of their inner structure into a written text structure must precede the annotation? The Czech Academic Corpus will help us to find out the answers.</abstract>

Moreover, these are just some of the spoken language phenomena, taken from just one random utterance; a thorough look at the spoken part of the CAC reveals that most of the well-known spoken language phenomena, e.g. grammatically incoherent utterances, grammatical additions spoken as an afterthought, redundant co-references or phrase-connecting errors (Shriver, 1994, Fitzgerald, 2009), are present in the texts but left unnoticed. In comparison, however, the PDT covers none of these typical spoken structures in the text annotation guidelines (the main reason being that it does not contain spoken material in the first place). Thus, at the surfacesyntactic layer (the a-layer) of the PDT, there are only limited means for capturing such spoken phenomena. For example, words playing the role of fillers could get the analytical function AuxO designed mostly for a redundant (deictic or emotive) constituent.

In CAC, dependencies and syntactic tags for these tokens are missing. Other differences in both syntactic scenarios will be described in the next section since they are related to spoken language annotation. 5 CAC syntactic annotation of spoken utterances Current Czech syntactic theory is based almost entirely on written Czech but spoken language often differs strikingly from the written one (Müllerová, 1994). In the CAC guidelines, only the following word-level markup specifically aimed at the spoken utterance structure is described: • non-identical reduplication of a word (value ‘7’ in column 6), • identical reduplication of a word (value ‘8’ in column 6), • ellipsis (value ‘9’ or ‘0’ in column 6). Let’s take this spoken utterance from CAC: CZ: A to jsou trošku, jedna je, jedna má světlou budovu a druhá má tmavou budovu, ony jsou umístěny v jednom, v jednom areále, ale ta, to centrum, patřilo té, bylo to v bloku Univerzity vlámské, a já jsem se ptala na univerzitě, na, v Univerzitě svobodné, že,</context>

The discussion on the concept of academic grammar of Czech, i.e. on the concept of CAC annotation, finally led to the traditional, systematic, and well elaborated concept of morphology and dependency syntax (Šmilauer, 1972). By the mid 1980s, a total of 540,000 words of CAC were morphologically and syntactically manually annotated. The documents originally selected for the CAC are articles taken from a range of media. The sources included newspapers and magazines, and transcripts of spoken language from radio and TV programs, covering administrative, journalistic and scientific fields. The original CAC was on par with it peers at the time (such as the Brown corpus) in size, coverage, and annotation; it surpassed them in that it contained (some) syntactic annotation. CAC was used in the first experiments of stati</context>

No distinction in strategy of written and spoken texts annotation transformation was made. However, spoken texts were eventually excluded from the CAC 2.0 (Figure 1). Reasons for this are explained in detail in the following two sections. 4 Syntax in the CAC and the PDT 4.1 Syntactic annotation in the CAC The syntactic analysis of Czech in the CAC and in the PDT is very much alike, but there are phenomena in which the CAC syntactic annotation scenario differs from the PDT, even though both corpora are based on the same linguistic theory (Šmilauer, 1969), i.e. on the dependency grammar notion common to the “Prague school” of linguists since the 1930s. However, the syntactic annotation differs between the two corpora. The CAC works with a single syntactic layer, whereas the PDT works with two independent (although interlinked) syntactic layers: an analytical (syntactic) one and a tectogrammatical one (a-layer and t-layer, respectively). In this paper, we are referring to the a-layer of the PDT in our comparisons unless specifically noted for those elements of the tectogrammatical annotation that do have some counterpart in the CAC.

For example, in both corpora the predicate is the clausal head and the subject is its dependent, unlike the descriptions we can find in the traditional Czech syntactic theory (Šmilauer, 1969). Another (technical) similarity can be found in the way the dependency types are encoded. In both corpora, the dependency type label is stored at the dependent. No confusion arises since the link from a dependent to its governor is unique. However, the list of differences is actually quite long. Some are minor and technical: for example, in the PDT an “overarching” root of the sentence tree (marked AuxS) is always added, so that all other nodes appear as if they depend on it. Some differences are more profound and are described below. We are not going to list all the differences in individual</context>
