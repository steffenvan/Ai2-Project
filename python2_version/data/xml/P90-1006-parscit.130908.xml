The limited capacity of working memory is intrinsic
to human sentence processing, and therefore must be
addressed by any theory of human sentence process-
ing. I assume that the amount of short term memory
that is necessary at any stage in the parsing process is
determined by the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic
properties of the structure(s) that have been built up to
that point in the parse. A sentence becomes unaccept-
able for processing reasons if the combination of these
properties produces too great a load for the working
memory capacity (cf. Frazier 1985):

where:
K is the maximum allowable processing load
(in processing load units or PLUs),
xi is the number of PLUs associated with prop-
erty i,
n is the number of properties,
Ai is the number of times property i appears in
the structure in question.
Furthermore, the assumptions described above pro-
vide a simple mechanism for the explanation of com-
mon psycholinguistic phenomena such as garden-path
effects and preferred readings for ambiguous sentences.
Following Fodor (1983), I assume that the language
processor is an automatic device that uses a greedy al-
gorithm: only the best of the set of all compatible rep-
resentations for an input string are locally maintained
from word to word. One way to make this idea explicit
is to assume that restrictions on memory allow at most
one representation for an input string at any time (see,
for example, Frazier and Fodor 1978; Frazier 1979;
Marcus 1980; Berwick and Weinberg 1984; Pritchett
1988). This hypothesis, commonly called the serial
hypothesis, is easily compatible with the above view
of processing load calculation: given a choice between
two different representations for the same input string,
simply choose the representation that is associated with
the lower processing load.
The serial hypothesis is just one way of placing local
memory restrictions on the parsing model, however. In
this paper I will present an alternative formulation of
local memory restrictions within a parallel framework.
There is a longstanding debate in the psycholinguis-
tic literature as to whether or not more than one rep-
resentation for an input can be maintained in parallel
(see, for example, Kurtzman (1985) or Gorrell (1987)
for a history of the debate). It turns out that the par-
allel view appears to handle some kinds of data more
directly than the serial view, keeping in mind that the
data are often controversial. For example, it is difficult
to explain in a serial model why relative processing
load increases as ambiguous input is encountered (see,
for example, Fodor at al. 1968; Rayner at al. 1983;
Gorrell 1987). Data that is normally taken to be support
for the serial hypothesis includes garden-path effects
and the existence of preferred readings of ambiguous
input. However, as noted above, limiting the number
of allowable representations is only one way of con-
straining parallelism so that these effects can also be
accounted for in a parallel framework.
As a result of the plausibility of a parallel model, I
propose to limit the difference in processing load that
may be present between two structures for the same in-
put, rather than limit the number of structures allowed
in the processing of an input (cf. Gibson 1987; Gibson
and Clark 1987; Clark and Gibson 1988). Thus I as-
sume that the human parser prefers one structure over
another when the processing load (in PLUs) associated
with maintaining the first is markedly lower than the
processing load associated with maintaining the sec-
ond. That is, I assume there exists some arithmetic
preference quantity P corresponding to a processing
load, such that if the processing loads associated with
two representations for the same string differ by load P,
then only the representation associated with the smaller
of the two loads is pursued) Given the existence of a
llt is possible that the preference factor is a georneiric one
rather than an ariihmelic one. Given a geometric preference
factor, one structure is preferred over another when the ratio
of their processing loads reaches a threshold value. I explore
only the arithmetic possibility in this paper; it is possible
that the geometric alternative gives results that are as good,
although I leave this issue for future research,

preference factor P. it is easy to account for garden-path
effects and preferred readings of ambiguous sentences.
Both effects occur because of a local ambiguity which
is resolved in favor of one reading. In the case of a
garden-path effect, the favored reading is not compati-
ble with the whole sentence. Given two representations
for the same input string that differ in processing load
by at least the factor P, only the less computationally
expensive structure will be pursued. If that structure
is not compatible with the rest of the sentence and the
discarded structure is part of a successful parse of the
sentence, a garden-path effect results. If the parse is
successful, but the discarded structure is compatible
with another reading for the sentence, then only a pre-
ferred reading for the sentence has been calculated.
Thus if we know where one reading of a (temporarily)
ambiguous sentence becomes the strongly preferred
reading, we can write art inequality associated with
this preference:

<bodyText confidence="0.967026553191489">
where:
P is the preference factor (in PLUs),
xi is the number of PLUs associated with prop-
erty 1,
n is the number of properties.
Ai is the number of times property i appears in
the unpreferred structure,
Bi is the number of times property i appears in
the preferred structure.
Given a parsing algorithm together with n proper-
ties and their associated processing loads x1 .x,,, we
may write inequalities having the form of (1) and (2)
corresponding to the processing load at various parse
states. An algebraic technique called linear program-
ming can then be used to solve this system of linear
inequalities, giving an n-dimensional space for the val-
ues of xi as a solution, any point of which satisfies all
the inequalities.
In this paper I will concentrate on syntactic
properties:2 in particular, I present two properties
based on the 0-Criterion of Government and Binding
Theory (Chomsky 1981).3 It will be shown that these
properties, once associated with processing loads, pre-
dict a large array of garden-path effects. Furthermore,
it is demonstrated that these properties also make de-
2Note that I assume that there also exist semantic and
pragmatic properties which are associated with significant
processing loads, but which are not discussed here.
In another syntactic theory, similar properties may be ob-
tained from the principles that correspond to the 0-Criterion
in that theozy. For example, the completeness and coherence
conditions of Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan 1982)
would derive properties similar to those derived from the
0-Criterion. The same empirical effects should result from
these two sets of properties.
sirable predictions with respect to unacceptability due
to memory capacity overload.
The organization of this paper is given as follows:
first, the structure of the underlying parser is described;
second, the two syntactic properties are proposed;
third, a number of locally ambiguous sentences, in-
cluding some garden-paths, are examined with respect
to these properties and a solution space for the process-
ing loads of the two properties is calculated; fourth, it
is shown that this space seems to make the right predic-
tions with respect to processing overload; conclusions
are given in the final section.

2 THE UNDERLYING PARSER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999793611111111">
The parser to which the memory limitation constraints
apply must construct representations in such a way
so that incomplete input will be associated with some
structure. Furthermore, the parsing algorithm must, in
principle, allow more than one structure for an input
string, so that the general constraints described in the
previous section may apply to restrict the possibilities.
The parsing model that I will assume is an extension of
the model described in Clark and Gibson (1988). When
a word is input, representations for each of its lexical
entries are built and placed in the buffer, a one cell
data structure that holds a set of tree structures. The
parsing model contains a second data structure, the
stack-set, which contains a set of stacks of buffer cells.
The parser builds trees in parallel based on possible
attachments made between the buffer and the top of
each stack in the stack-set. The buffer and stack-set
are formally defined in (3) and (4).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9641125">
(3) A buffer cell is a set of structures { S1, ...,S„ },
where each Si represents the same segment of the input
string. The Inger contains one buffer cell.
(4) The stack-set is a set of stacks of buffer cells, where
each stack represents the same segment of the input
string:

where:
p is the number of stacks;
mi is the number of buffer cells in stack i;
and n,j is the number of tree structures in the
jth buffer cell of stack 1.
The motivation for these data structures is given
by the desire for a completely unconstrained parsing
algorithm upon which constraints may be placed: this
algorithm should allow all possible parser operations
to occur at each parse state. There are exactly two
parser operations: attaching a node to another node arid

<bodyText confidence="0.989134411764706">
pushing a buffer cell onto a stack. In order to allow
both of these operations to be performed in parallel,
it is necessary to have the given data structures: the
buffer and the stack-set. For example, consider a parser
state in which the buffer is non-empty and the stack-set
contains only a single cell stack:
Stack-set: { { f Si , S„ 1 } 1
Buffer: { B1, ...,/3„, }
Suppose that attachments are possible between the
buffer and the single stack cell. The structures that
result from these attachments will take up a single stack
cell. Let us call these resultant structures A1, A2, ...,Ak.
If all possible operations are to take place at this parser
state, then the contents of the current buffer must also
be pushed on top of the current stack. Thus two stacks,
both representing the same segment of the input string
will result:

<equation confidence="0.9591245">
Stack 1: { f { Ai , ...,Ak}1 }
Stack 2: {{ { f Si, ...,S„} }}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970333333333">
Since these two stacks break up the same segment
of the input string in different ways, the stack-set data
structure is necessary.

3 TWO SYNTACTIC PROPERTIES
DERIVABLE FROM THE
9-CRITERION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955044242424243">
Following early work in linguistic theory, I distin-
guish two kinds of categories: functional categories
and thematic or content categories (see, for example,
Fukui and Speas (1986) and Abney (1987) and the ref-
erences cited in each). Thematic categories include
nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions: functional
categories include determiners, complementizers, and
inflection markers. There are a number of properties
that distinguish functional elements from thematic ele-
ments, the most crucial being that functional elements
mark grammatical or relational features while thematic
elements pick out a class of objects or events. I will as-
sume as a working hypothesis that only those syntactic
properties that have to do with the thematic elements of
an utterance are relevant to preferences and overload
in processing. One principle of syntax that is directly
involved with the thematic content of an utterance in a
Government-Binding theory is the 0-Criterion:
(7) Each argument bears one and only one 0-role (the-
matic rote) and each 0-role is assigned to one and only
one argument (Chomsky 1981:36).
I hypothesize that the human parser attempts to lo-
cally satisfy the 0-Criterion whenever possible. Thus
given a thematic role, the parser prefers to assign that
rote, and given a thematic element, the parser prefers
to assign a rote to that element. These assumptions arc
made explicit as the following properties:
(8) The Property of Thematic Reception (PTR):
Associate a load of xm PLUs of short term memory
to each thematic element that is in a position that can
receive a thematic role in some co-existing structure,
but whose 0-assigner is not unambiguously identifiable
in the structure in question.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.62034325">
(9) The Property of Thematic Assignment (PTA):
Associate a load of xT/t PLUs of short term memory
to each thematic role that is not assigned to a node
containing a thematic element.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997755">
Note that the Properties of Thematic Assignment
and Reception are stated in terms of thematic elements.
Thus the Property of Thematic Reception doesn&apos;t apply
to functional categories, whether or not they are in
positions that receive thematic roles. Similarly, if a
thematic role is assigned to a functional category, the
Property of Thematic Assignment does not notice until
there is a thematic element inside this constituent.

<bodyText confidence="0.9984614">
The verb expect is ambiguous: either it takes an NP
complement as in the sentence John expected Mary or
it takes an /P complement as in (10).4 Consider the
state of the parse of (10) after the word Mary has been
processed:

In (11a), the NP Mary is attached as the NP com-

unassigned. In (1 Ib), the NP Mary is the specifier of
a hypothesized IP node which is attached as the com-
plement of the other reading of expected.5 This rep-
resentation is associated with at least xm PLUs since
the NP Mary is in a position that can be associated
with a thematic role, the subject position, but whose
0-assigner is not yet identifiable. No load is associated
with the Property of Thematic Assignment, however,
since both thematic roles of the verb expected are as-

there is no difficulty in processing sentence (10), the
load difference between these two structures cannot be
greater than P PLUs, the preference factor in inequality

<equation confidence="0.636883">
(12) xrx &lt;P

<bodyText confidence="0.996220533333333">
Since the load difference between the two struc-
tures is not sufficient to cause a strong preference, both
structures are maintained. Note that this is an im-
portant difference between the theories presented here
and the theory presented in Frazier and Fodor (1978),
Frazier (1979) and Pritchett (1988). In each of these
theories, only one representation can be maintained,
so that either (11a) or (1 lb) would be preferred. In
order to account for the lack of difficulty in parsing
(10), Frazier and Pritchett both assume that reanalysis
in certain situations is not expensive. No such stipu-
lation is necessary in the framework given here: it is
simply assumed that an reanalysis is expensive.6
Consider now sentence (13) with respect to the Prop-
erties of Thematic Assignment and Reception:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9061">
(13) John expected her mother to like Fred.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996286">
Consider the state of the parse of (13) after the word
her has been processed. In one representation the NP
her will be attached as the NP complement of expected:

<listItem confidence="0.603476">
(14) fir [Np John] [VP expected [Np her 1]]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999598285714286">
In this representation there is no load associated with
either of the Properties of Thematic Assignment or Re-
ception since no thematic objects need thematic roles
and no thematic roles are left unassigned. In another
representation the NP her is the specifier of a hypoth-
esized NP which is pushed onto a substack containing
the other reading of the verb expected:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7408765">
(15) { tip [Np John ] [vp expected [fp e]]] }
[NP [NP her ]]}}
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988935705882353">
This representation is associated with at least xra
PLUs since the verb expected has a thematic role to as-
sign. However, no load is associated with the genitive
NP specifier her since its 0-assigner, although not yet
present, is unambiguously identified as the head of the
NP to follow (Chemsky (1986a)).7 Thus the total load
associated with (15) is xm PLUS. Since there is no dif-
ficulty in processing sentence (10), the load difference

proposed here and serial models such as those proposed by
Frazier and Fodor (1978) and Pritchett (1988).
7Note that specifiers do not always receive their thematic
roles from the categories which they specify. For example,
a non-genitive noun phrase may specify any major category.
In particular, it may specify an IP or a CP. But the specifier of
these categories may receive its thematic role through chain
formation from a distant 0-assigner, as in (16):

(18) xm &lt; P
Now consider (19):8
(19) # I put the candy on the table in my mouth.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980344">
This sentence becomes ambiguous when the prepo-
sition on is read. This preposition may attach as an
argument of the verb put or as a modifier of the NP the
candy:

<listItem confidence="0.9211325">
(20) a. I [vp [v, [v put ] [Np the candy] [pp on ] ]1
b. I [vP [V, [V put [Np the candy [pp on 111]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.967538551724138">
At this point the argument attachment is strongly
preferred. However, this attachment turns out to be
incompatible with the rest of the sentence. When the
word mouth is encountered, no pragmatically coherent
structure can be built, since tables are not normally
found in mouths. Thus a garden-path effect results.
Consider the parse state depicted in (20) with respect to
the Properties of Thematic Assignment and Reception.
The load associated with the structure resulting from
argument attachment is xm PLUs since, although the 0-
grid belonging to the verbput is filled, the thematic role
assigned by the preposition on remains unassigned. On
the other hand, the load associated with the modifier
attachment is 2 *xm +xTR PLUs since 1) both the verb
put and the preposition on have thematic roles that need
to be assigned and 2) the PP headed by on receives
a thematic role in the argument attachment structure,
while it receives no such role in the structure under
consideration. Thus the difference between the loads
associated with the two structures is XTA + xTR PLUs.
Since the argument attachment structure is strongly
preferred over the other structure, I hypothesize that
this load is greater than P PLUs:
(21) xm xTR &gt;P
Now consider the the well-known garden-path sen-
tence in (22):
(22) # The horse raced past the barn fell.
The structure for the input the horse raced is am-
biguous between at least the two structures in (23):

<listItem confidence="0.555632">

Structure (23a) has no load associated with it due
to either the PTA or the PTR. Crucially note that the
verb raced has an intransitive reading so that no load
is required via the Property of Thematic Assignment.
On the other hand, structure (23b) requires a load of
2 *xTR PLUs since 1) the noun phrase the horse is in a
position that can receive a thematic role, but currently
does not and 2) the operator Oi is in a position that

the processing loads of structures (23a) and (23b) is
2 * xTR PLUs. Since this sentence is a strong garden-
path sentence, it is hypothesized that a load difference
of 2 * xTR PLUs is greater than the allowable limit, P
PLUs:
(24) 2 *Xnz &gt;P
A surprising effect occurs when a verb which op-
tionally subcategorizes for a direct object, like race, is
replaced by a verb which obligatorily subcategorizes
for a direct object, likefind:
(25) The bird found in the room was dead.
Although the structures and local ambiguities in (25)
and (22) are similar, (22) causes a garden-path effect
while, surprisingly, (25) does not. To determine why
(25) is not a garden-path sentence we need to examine
the local ambiguity when the word found is read:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.560969">
(26) a. [fp [Np the bird ] [vp [v found] [NP I ]]]
b. [IP [14P the [N, birdi I [cc&apos; Oi found ]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.948878705882353">
The crucial difference between the verb found and
the verb raced is that found requires a direct object,
while raced does not. Since the 0-grid of the verb
found is not filled in structure (26a), this representation
is associated with xrA PLUs of memory load. Like
structure (23b), structure (26b) requires 2 * XTR PLUs.
Thus the difference between the processing loads of
structures (26a) and (26b) is 2 *xTR — xrA PLUS. Since
no garden-path effect results in (25),! hypothesize that
this load is less than or equal to P PLUs:
(27) 2 * XTR XTA &lt; P
Furthermore, these results correctly predict that sen-
tence (28) is not a garden-path sentence either:
(28) The bird found in the room enough debris to build
a nest.
Hence we have the following system of inequalities:
(29) a. xix P

This system of inequalities is consistent. Thus it
identifies a particular solution space. This solution
space is depicted by the shaded region in Figure 1.
Note that, pretheoretically, there is no reason for
this system of inequalities to be consistent. It could
have been that the parser state of one of the example
sentences forced an inequality that contradicted some

As a result of the Theta Reanalysis Constraint, the
necessary reanalysis in each of (10) and (25) is not
expensive, so that no garden-path effect is predicted.
Furthermore, the reanalysis in sentences like (22) and
(19) violates the TRC, so that the garden-path effects
are predicted.
However, there are a number of empirical problems
with Pritchett&apos;s theory. First of all, it turns out that the
10Frazier and Rayner (1982) make a similar stipulation to
account for problems with the theory of Frazier and Fodor
(1978). However, their account fails to explain the lack
of garden-path effect in (25). See Pritchett (1988) for a
description of further problems with their analysis.

Theta Reanalysis Constraint as defined in (30) incor-
rectly predicts that the sentences in (32) do not induce
garden-path effects:

<bodyText confidence="0.999436090909091">
For example, consider (32a). When the auxiliary
verb was is encountered, reanalysis is forced. How-
ever, the auxiliary verb was does not have a thematic
role to assign to its subject, the dog, so the TRC is not
violated. Thus Pritchett&apos;s theory incorrectly predicts
that these sentences do not cause garden-path effects.
Other kinds of local ambiguity that do not give the
human parser difficulty also pose a challenge to serial
parsers. Marcus (1980) gives the sentences in (33) as
evidence that any deterministic parser must be able to
look ahead in the input string:11

Any serial parser must be able to account for the
lack of difficulty with either of the sentences in (33).
It turns out that the Theta Reanalysis Constraint does
not help in cases like these: no matter which analysis
is pursued first, reanalysis wilt violate the TRC.

4.2 EMPIRICAL SUPPORT: FURTHER
GARDEN-PATH EFFECTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970073181818182">
Given the Properties of Thematic Assignment and Re-
ception and their associated loads, we may now explain
many more garden-path effects. Consider (34):
(34) # The Russian women loved died.
Up until the last word, this sentence is ambiguous
between two readings: one where loved is the matrix
verb; and the other where loved heads a relative clause
modifier of the noun Russian. The strong preference
for the matrix verb interpretation of the word loved
can be easily explained if we examine the possible
structures upon reading the word women:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.672699666666667">
(35) a. [ip [Np the Russian women] ]
b. bp ky the [N, [fp Russians] [cP [NP Ot [NP
women j ]] ]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995421409090909">
Structure (35a) requires xTR PLUs since the NP the
Russian women needs but currently lacks a thematic
role. Structure (35b), on the other hand, requires at
least 3 *xTR PLUs since 1) two noun phrases, the Rus-
sian and women, need but currently lack thematic roles;
and 2) the operator in the specifier position of the mod-
ifying Comp phrase can be associated with a thematic
role, but currently is not linked to one. Since the dif-
ference between these loads is 2 * xTR, a garden-path
effect results.
Consider now (36):
(36)# John told the man that Mary kissed that Bill saw
Phil.
&amp;quot;Note that model that I am proposing here is a parallel
model, and therefore is nondeterministic.
When parsing sentence (36), people will initially
analyze the CP that Mary kissed unambiguously as
an argument of the verb told. It turns out that this
hypothesis is incompatible with the rest of the sentence,
so that a garden-path effect results. In order to see how
the garden-path effect comes about, consider the parse
state which occurs after the word Mary is read:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.88870175">
(37) a. [rp [Np John I [v [v&apos; [v told] [Np the man] [cP
that] [IP [NP Mary ] ]] l]]
b. Up [Np John] [vp [v told] E.Np the [N&apos;
mans] [cP [Np Os 1 that [IP Gip Mary ]]]l]]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.977842044444445">
Structure (37a) requires no load by the PTA since
the 0-grid of the only 0-assigner is filled with struc-
tures that each contain thematic elements. However,
the noun phrase Mary requires xTR PLUs by the Prop-
erty of Thematic Reception since this NP is in a the-
matic position but does not yet receive a thematic role.
Thus the total load associated with structure (37a) is
xTR PLUs. Structure (37b), on the other hand, requires
a load of xrA +2*xm since 1) the thematic role PROPOSI-
TION is not yet assigned by the verb told; 2) the operator
in the specifier position of the CP headed by that is not
linked to a thematic role; and 3) the NP Mary is in
thematic position but does not receive a thematic role
yet. Thus the load difference is xrA +xTR PLUS, enough
for the more expensive one to be dropped. Thus only
structure (37a) is maintained and a garden-path effect
eventually results, since this structure is not compati-
ble with the entire sentence. Hence the Properties of
Thematic Assignment and Reception make the correct
predictions with respect to (36).
Consider the garden-path sentence in (38):
(38) # John gave the boy the dog bit a dollar.
This sentence causes a garden-path effect since the
noun phrase the dog is initially analyzed as the direct
object of the verb gave rather than as the subject of a
relative clause modifier of the NP the boy. This garden-
path can be explained in the same way as previous
examples. Consider the state of the parse after the NP
the dog has been processed:
(39) a. [11, bip John I Evp fv, [v gave] [Np the boy ] [Np
the dog]]]]
b. frp [Np John] [vP [v, [v gave] [Np the bp [No
bOY][CP [NP 0 i] [IP [NP the dog ] ]] [Np ] 111)1
While structure (39a) requires no load at this stage,
structure (39b) requires 2 * xTR + xTA PLUs since 1)
one thematic role has not yet been assigned by the verb
gave; 2) the operator in the specifier position of the
CP modifying boy is not linked to a thematic role; and
3) the NP the dog is in a thematic position but does
not yet receive a thematic role. Thus structure (39a) is
strongly preferred and a garden-path effect results.
The garden-path effect in (40) can also be easily
explained in this framework:
(40) # The editor authors the newspaper hired liked
laughed.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997446">
44

<bodyText confidence="0.991776">
Consider the state of the parse of (40) after the word
authors has been read:

<bodyText confidence="0.9999675">
The word authors is ambiguous between nominal
and verbal interpretations. The structure including the
verbal reading is associated with xTA PLUs since the
0-grid for the verb authors includes art unassigned role.
Structure (41b), on the other hand, includes three
noun phrases, each of which is in a position that may
be linked to a thematic role but currently is not linked
to any 0-role. Thus the load associated with structure
(4 lb) is 3 * x PLUs. Since the difference between
the loads associated with structures (41b) and (41a) is
so high (3 * PLUs), only the inexpensive
structure, structure (41a), is maintained.

5 PROCESSING OVERLOAD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984970534883721">
The Properties of Thematic Assignment and Recep-
tion also give a plausible account of the unacceptability
of sentences with an abundance of center-embedding.
Recall that I assume that a sentence is unacceptable
because of short term memory overload if the com-
bination of memory associated with properties of the
structures built at some stage of the parse of the sen-
tence is greater than the allowable processing load K.
Consider (42):
(42) # The man that the woman that the dog bit likes
eats fish.
Having input the noun phrase the dog the structure
for the partial sentence is as follows:
(43) [tp ivp the [N, [N, mani [cp [Np Oi ] that [IP [NP
the [N, [No womanj][cp [Np Of]that [IP [NP the dog 11
In this representation there are three lexical noun
phrases that need thematic roles but lack them. Fur-
thermore, there are two non-lexical NPs, operators, that
are in positions that may prospectively be linked to
thematic roles. Thus, under my assumptions, the load
associated with this representation is at least 5 *
PLUs. I assume that these properties are responsible
for the unacceptability of this sentence, resulting in the
inequality in (44):
(44) 5 *.xm &gt;K
Note that sentences with only one relative clause
modifying the subject are acceptable, as is exemplified
in (45)
(45) The man that the woman likes eats fish.
Since (45) is acceptable, its load is below the max-
imum at all stages of its processing. After processing
the noun phrase the woman in (45), there are three noun
phrases that currently lack 0-roles but may be linked to
0-roles as future input appears. Thus we arrive at the
inequality in (46):
(46) 3 * xm &lt; 45
Thus I assume that the maximum processing load
that people can handle lies somewhere above 3 * xrR
PLUS but somewhere below 5 * x PLUS, Although
these data are only suggestive, they clearly make the
right kinds of predictions. Future research should es-
tablish the boundary between acceptability and unac-
ceptability more precisely.

6 CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978333333333">
Since the structural properties that are used in the for-
mation of the inequalities are independently motivated,
and the system of inequalities is solvable, the theory
of human sentence processing presented here makes
strong, testable predictions with respect to the process-
ability of a given sentence. Furthermore, the success of
the method provides empirical support for the particu-
lar properties used in the formation of the inequalities.
Thus a theory of PLUs, the preference factor P and
the overload factor K provides a unified account of 1)
acceptability and relative acceptability; 2) garden-path
effects; and 3) preferred readings for ambiguous input.

Thematic categories include nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions: functional categories include determiners, complementizers, and inflection markers. There are a number of properties that distinguish functional elements from thematic elements, the most crucial being that functional elements mark grammatical or relational features while thematic elements pick out a class of objects or events.

Following Fodor (1983), I assume that the language processor is an automatic device that uses a greedy algorithm: only the best of the set of all compatible representations for an input string are locally maintained from word to word. One way to make this idea explicit is to assume that restrictions on memory allow at most one representation for an input string at any time (see, for example, Frazier and Fodor 1978; Frazier 1979; Marcus 1980; Berwick and Weinberg 1984; Pritchett 1988). This hypothesis, commonly called the serial hypothesis, is easily compatible with the above view of processing load calculation: given a choice between two different representations for the same input string, simply choose the representation that is associated with the lower processing load. The serial hypothesis is just one way of placing local memory restrictions on the parsing model, however. In this paper I will present an alternative formulation of local memory restrictions within a parallel framework. There is a longstanding debate in the psycholinguistic literature as</context>

I will assume as a working hypothesis that only those syntactic properties that have to do with the thematic elements of an utterance are relevant to preferences and overload in processing. One principle of syntax that is directly involved with the thematic content of an utterance in a Government-Binding theory is the 0-Criterion: (7) Each argument bears one and only one 0-role (thematic rote) and each 0-role is assigned to one and only one argument (Chomsky 1981:36). I hypothesize that the human parser attempts to locally satisfy the 0-Criterion whenever possible. Thus given a thematic role, the parser prefers to assign that rote, and given a thematic element, the parser prefers to assign a rote to that element. These assumptions arc made explicit as the following properties: (8) The Property of Thematic Reception (PTR): Associate a load of xm PLUs of short term memory to each thematic element that is in a position that can receive a thematic role in some co-existing structure, but whose 0-assigner is not unambiguously identifiable in the structure i</context>

However, as noted above, limiting the number of allowable representations is only one way of constraining parallelism so that these effects can also be accounted for in a parallel framework. As a result of the plausibility of a parallel model, I propose to limit the difference in processing load that may be present between two structures for the same input, rather than limit the number of structures allowed in the processing of an input (cf. Gibson 1987; Gibson and Clark 1987; Clark and Gibson 1988).

Furthermore, the parsing algorithm must, in principle, allow more than one structure for an input string, so that the general constraints described in the previous section may apply to restrict the possibilities. The parsing model that I will assume is an extension of the model described in Clark and Gibson (1988). When a word is input, representations for each of its lexical entries are built and placed in the buffer, a one cell data structure that holds a set of tree structures. The parsing model contains a second data structure, the stack-set, which contains a set of stacks of buffer cells. The parser builds trees in parallel based on possible attachments made between the buffer and the top of each stack in the stack-set. The buffer and stack-set are formally defined in (3) and (4). (3) A buffer cell is a set of structures { S1, ...,S„ }, where each Si represents the same segment of the input string</context>

I assume that the amount of short term memory that is necessary at any stage in the parsing process is determined by the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties of the structure(s) that have been built up to that point in the parse. A sentence becomes unacceptable for processing reasons if the combination of these properties produces too great a load for the working memory capacity (cf.

Thematic categories include nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions: functional categories include determiners, complementizers, and inflection markers. There are a number of properties that distinguish functional elements from thematic elements, the most crucial being that functional elements mark grammatical or relational features while thematic elements pick out a class of objects or events.

Following Fodor (1983), I assume that the language processor is an automatic device that uses a greedy algorithm: only the best of the set of all compatible representations for an input string are locally maintained from word to word. One way to make this idea explicit is to assume that restrictions on memory allow at most one representation for an input string at any time (see, for example, Frazier and Fodor 1978; Frazier 1979; Marcus 1980; Berwick and Weinberg 1984; Pritchett 1988). This hypothesis, commonly called the serial hypothesis, is easily compatible with the above view of processing load calculation: given a choice between two different representations for the same input string, simply choose the representation that is associated with the lower processing load. The serial hypothesis is just one way of placing local memory restrictions on the parsing model, however. In this paper I will present an alternative formulation of local memory restrictions within a parallel framework. There is a longstanding debate in the psycholinguistic literature as to whether or no</context>

Thus the inequality in (12) is obtained: (12) xrx &lt;P Since the load difference between the two structures is not sufficient to cause a strong preference, both structures are maintained. Note that this is an important difference between the theories presented here and the theory presented in Frazier and Fodor (1978), Frazier (1979) and Pritchett (1988). In each of these theories, only one representation can be maintained, so that either (11a) or (1 lb) would be preferred. In order to account for the lack of difficulty in parsing (10), Frazier and Pritchett both assume that reanalysis in certain situations is not expensive. No such stipulation is necessary in the framework given here: it is simply assumed that an reanalysis is expensive.6 Consider now sentence (13) with respect to the Properties of Thematic Assignment and Reception: (13) John expected her mother to like Fred. Consider the state of the parse of (13) after the word her has bee</context>

However, no load is associated with the genitive NP specifier her since its 0-assigner, although not yet present, is unambiguously identified as the head of the NP to follow (Chemsky (1986a)).7 Thus the total load associated with (15) is xm PLUS. Since there is no difficulty in processing sentence (10), the load difference 6S ee Section 4.1 for a brief comparison between the model proposed here and serial models such as those proposed by Frazier and Fodor (1978) and Pritchett (1988). 7Note that specifiers do not always receive their thematic roles from the categories which they specify. For example, a non-genitive noun phrase may specify any major category. In particular, it may specify an IP or a CP. But the specifier of these categories may receive its thematic role through chain formation from a distant 0-assigner, as in (16): (16) John appears to like beans. Note that there is no NP that corresponds to (16) (Cho msky (1970)): (17) * John&apos;s appearance to like beans. 42 between these two structures cannot be greater than P PLUS. Thus the second inequality, (18), is obt</context>

Figure 1: The Solution Space for the Inequalities in might be incorrect. Since this situation has not yet been observed, the results mutually support one another. 4.1 A COMPARISON WITH SERIAL MODELS Because serial models of parsing can maintain at most one representation for any input string, they have difficulty explaining the lack of garden-path effects in sentences like (10) and (25): (10) John expected Mary to like Fred. (25) The bird found in the room was dead. As a result of this difficulty Pritchett (1988) proposes the Theta Reanalysis Constraint:10 (30) Theta Reanalysis Constraint (TRC): Syntactic reanalysis which interprets a 0-marked constituent as outside its current 0-Domain and as within an existing 0-Domain of which it is not a member is costly. (31) 0-Domain: a is in the -y 0-Domain of 9 if a receives the 7 0-role from j9 or a is dominated by a constituent that receives the -y 0-role from [1. As a result of the Theta Reanalysis Constraint, the necessary reanalysis in each of (10) and (25) is not expensive, so that no garden-path effect is predicted. Furthermore, the reanalysis in senten</context>
