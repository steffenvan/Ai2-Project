<bodyText confidence="0.999800565217391">
This talk introduces new research that works towards an
overarching model of natural face-to-face conversation
about spatially-located actions in the world, and then
uses that model to implement a trustworthy embodied
conversational agent to guide users&apos; ongoing, real-world
activities away from the desktop.
Past research has demonstrated that the relationship
between verbal and nonverbal behavior exists at the
level of intonational phrases, conversational turns, dis-
course units, and the negotiation of reference to objects
and actions, that mental representations of shared space
are structured in such a way as to allow participants in a
dialogue to draw on them, that dialogue systems must
be based on models of coordination and collaboration,
and that users are willing to engage in persistent, natu-
ral, trusting conversation with embodied conversational
systems. In this talk, these diverse strands of research
are brought together in the service of a single underly-
ing modality-independent model of action and language,
non-verbal behaviors and words, production and com-
prehension that can lead to a physically-located, spa-
tially-aware, collaborative embodied conversational
agent.
