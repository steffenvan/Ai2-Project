This paper treats the classification of the se-
mantic functions performed by adnominal con-
stituents in Japanese, where many parts of
speech act as adnominal constituents. In order
to establish a formal treatment of the semantic
roles, the similarities and differences among ad-
nominal constituents, i.e. adjectives and &amp;quot;noun
+ NO (in English &amp;quot;of + noun&amp;quot;)&amp;quot; structures,
which have a broad range of semantic func-
tions, are discussed. This paper also proposes
an objective method of classifying these con-
structs using a large amount of linguistic data.
The feasibility of this was verified with a self-
organizing semantic map based on a neural net-
work model.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849466666667">
Pustejovsky (Pustejovsky, 1995) proposed the
theory of a generative lexicon as a framework by
which meanings of words are expressed in one
unified representation. This kind of generativity
would be very useful for NLP, especially if it is
applicable to the complex semantic structures
represented by various modification relations.
In our previous research on adjectives (Isahara
and Kanzaki, 1999) we used Pustejovsky&apos;s the-
ory to classify adjectives in Japanese. In this pa-
per we take the first steps in a similar classifica-
tion of the Japanese &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; construction.
Bouillon (Bouillon. 1996) applied this theory
to the adnominal constituent of mental states.
Saint-Dizier (Saint-Dizier, 1998) discussed ad-
jectives in French.
Isahara and Kanzaki (Isahara and Kanzaki,
1999) treated a much wider range of phenom-
ena of adnominal constituents. They classified
the semantic roles of adnominal constituents
in Japanese, where many parts of speech act
as adnominal constituents, and discussed a for-
mal treatment of their semantic roles. In their
research, adnominal constituents, mainly ad-
jectives which function as adverbials, are dis-
cussed. The present paper describes the sim-
ilarities and differences among adnominal con-
stituents, i.e. adjectives and &amp;quot;noun + NO 1 (in
English &amp;quot;of + noun&amp;quot;)&amp;quot; structures which have
a broad range of semantic functions. This pa-
per proposes an objective method for classifying
these structures using a large amount of linguis-
tic data. The feasibility of this was verified with
a self-organizing semantic map based on a neu-
ral network model.
In section 2, we explain the semantic func-
tions performed by &amp;quot;noun + NO.&amp;quot; In section
3, we discuss how we can semi-automatically
obtain and classify examples of adjectives and
&amp;quot;noun NO&amp;quot; structures which have similar se-
mantic functions. In section 4, we introduce a
self-organizing semantic map to verify the result
of this classification. In section 5, we discuss
similarities and differences between adjectives
and &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures.

2 The Diversity of Semantic
Relations between &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot;
and their Head Nouns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966300461538462">
Among Japanese adnotninal constituents, &amp;quot;
noun + NO&amp;quot; represents a wider range of seman-
tic relations than other adnominal constituents.
Therefore, &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; does not always be-
have like the other adnominal constituents. In
previous work, some researchers have analyzed
semantic relations between the noun in the
&amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structure and its head noun (Shi-
mazu et al., 1986). Here, we show several ex-
amples that demonstrate the diversity of the se-
NO&apos; is a Japanese postpositional which can repre-
sent a wide range of semantic relations. It is similar to
&amp;quot;of&apos;&apos; in English.

These semantic relations between &amp;quot;noun +
NO&amp;quot; structures and their head nouns are dif-
ferent than those between other adnominal con-
stituents, e.g. adjectives and their head nouns.
However, some &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; behavior is sim-
ilar to the behavior of adjectives and nominal
adjectivals. In these cases &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; seems
not to differ semantically from adjectives and
nominal adjectivals. Let us consider the English
examples:
financial world / world of finance (&amp;quot;ZAIKAI&amp;quot;)
industrial center / center of industry
(&amp;quot;SANGYOU NO CHUUSHIN&amp;quot;)
In this case &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; need not be dis-
tinguished from an adjective with respect to se-
mantic behavior. However, in the following ex-
amples it is necessary to distinguish them from
one another.

We do not have a discrimination criteria that
automatically recognizes whether a &amp;quot;noun +
NO&amp;quot; structure is similar in its semantic behav-
ior to that of adjectives or not. We have at-
tempted to gather, semi-automatically, nouns in
the &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structure which behave like
adjectives.

3.1 The Basic Concept
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999679375">
There is one case in which the meanings of ad-
nominal constituents are semantically similar
to the features of the referents of their head
nouns, e.g. adnominal constituents represent
the concrete contents of their head nouns. Let
us consider the Japanese phrase &amp;quot;KANASHII
KIMOCHI (sad feeling)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;YOROKOBI NO
KIMOCHI (feeling of delight)&amp;quot; as examples.

NB: The English gloss of the &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot;
examples should be read from right to left.
One meaning of &amp;quot;KIMOCHI (feeling)&amp;quot; repre-
sents the semantic element &lt;mental state&gt;. In
the above examples, the adjective, &amp;quot;KANASHII
(sad)&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;YOROKOBI NO
(of delight)&amp;quot;, represent the concrete contents
of their head noun &amp;quot;KIMOCHI (feeling)&amp;quot;, i.e.
they also represent the mental state: &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;.
Therefore, even though they belong to different
parts of speech (adjective/noun), they must be
classified in the same semantic category since
both carry the same meaning. Neither the ad-
jective, &amp;quot;KANASHII (sad)&amp;quot;, nor the &amp;quot;noun +
NO&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;YOROKOBI NO (of delight)&amp;quot;, can ap-
pear in predicative position without changing
their meaning.
However, if adnominal constituents do not
share the same semantic concept as their head
noun, they cannot represent the contents of
head nouns. The examples below demonstrate
this.

In the above examples, the noun in &amp;quot;noun +
NO&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;JOHN&amp;quot;, does not include the concept,
&lt;mental state&gt;, so it cannot represent the con-
tent of &amp;quot;KIMOCHI (feeling).&amp;quot; The adjective,
&amp;quot;KANASHII (sad)&amp;quot;, and the noun in the &amp;quot;noun
+ NO&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;JOHN&amp;quot; do not embody the same con-
cept and have a different semantic relation with
their head noun. We cannot find the seman-
tic similarities between &amp;quot;KANASHII (sad)&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;JOHN&amp;quot; that we could between &amp;quot;YOROKOBI
NO (of delight)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;KANASHII (sad).&amp;quot; We
focus on the phenomena where adnominal con-
stituents represent the concrete contents of their
head nouns. This makes it possible to identify
adjectives and &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures which
are similar in semantic behavior to the referents
of their head nouns. These expressions are ex-
tracted semi-automatically from large corpora.

3.2 How to Extract the Necessary
Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995918036363637">
When we collect words which have some sim-
ilarities, it is difficult to select the semantic
axis for classification by making use of only
the co-occurring words. In collecting similar
words, some previous research took not only co-
occurring words but also the context of these
words into account (Grefenstette, 1994). One
of the important points of our analysis is the
introduction of the distinct semantic elements
that both &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures and adjecti-
vals (adjectives and noininals) have in common
with their head nouns. We wanted to ascertain
the similarities between &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; and other
adnominal constituents based on these common
semantic elements. For this reason, we used
the semantic relations, in which adnominal con-
stituents represent the concrete content of their
head nouns, as a key to classification. We au-
tomatically 2 extracted these relations from one
year of newspaper articles from Mainichi Shim-
bun (1994), 100 novels from Shincho publishers
and 100 books covering a variety of topics. We
used the following procedure to extract the nec-
essary information.
Step I) Extract from the corpora, all nouns
which are preceded by the Japanese expression
&amp;quot;TOBY which is something like &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;of.&amp;quot;

formation about the referent of the noun, such
as apposition. Therefore, nouns found in this
pattern may have their content elucidated by
means of their modifiers.
Step 2) Extract from the corpora, all &amp;quot;noun
+ NO&amp;quot; structures, adjectives and nominal ad-
jectivals which modify the nouns extracted in
step 1.
NB, the relationships between adnominal
constituents and their modified nouns extracted
here include not only representations of the con-
tents of the noun, but also other various rela-
tions.
Step 3) Extract &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures, ad-
jectives and nominal adjectivals which represent
the contents of the referents of the modified
nouns. Step 3 is done manually.
Step 4) In order to find the distribution of
their semantic categories and analyze the se-
mantic similarities between &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; and
other adnominal constituents in each semantic
category, we clustered the modified nouns auto-
matically. This clustering was based on sets of
similar adnominal constituents which represent
the content of the referent of the modified noun.

We can gather similar modified nouns when we
classify the modified nouns according to the
similarities of the adnominal constituents, be-
cause in our data both adnominal constituents
and their modified nouns have the same se-
mantic elements in common that we mentioned
above.
We attempted to construct the Semantic Map
of the modified nouns gathered by the above-
mentioned method by using the self-organizing
system of the neural network model (Ma et al.,
2000). We suppose that both modified nouns
and adnominal constituents have common se-
mantic elements when adnominal constituents
represent the concrete content of their head
nouns. If this is true, nouns with similar mean-
ings are located near each other on the semantic
map, self-organized by the similarities of seman-
tic elements among the adnominal constituents.
The result of our experiment verified this sup-
position (Figure 1). The nouns with a similar

and we could divide the distribution of the mod-
ified nouns into seven categories (Figure 2).
Each group, i.e. the &amp;quot;mental state&amp;quot;
group, &amp;quot;state/ situation&amp;quot; group, &amp;quot;characteris-
tics&amp;quot; group, &amp;quot;range/ area&amp;quot; group, &amp;quot;viewpoint/
standpoint&amp;quot; group, &amp;quot;aspect&amp;quot; group, and &amp;quot;oth-
ers,&amp;quot; represents a meaning held in common by
nouns in the group. Mental state can be fur-
ther divided into the state of emotion, mood
and intention. As we analyze the adnominal
constituents in each category of modified nouns,
we can find the possibility of the co-occurrence
of an adnorninal constituent with a head noun.

<bodyText confidence="0.9449776">
&amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures appear more fre-
quently than simple adjectives. Nominal adjec-
tivals derived from nouns plus the suffix &amp;quot;TEKI-

nouns in the groups &amp;quot;mental state: emotion&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;state/situation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;characteristics&amp;quot;, contain
abstract nouns which represent emotions, situa-
tions or characteristics. There are few concrete
nouns. However, in the groups &amp;quot;range/area&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;viewpoint/standpoint&amp;quot;, there are many
concrete nouns which represent natural phe-
nomena, organizations or professional domains
and few abstract nouns. We can find differences
among &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures, that is, there
are adjectives which behave like nouns semanti-
cally and there are nouns which behave seman-
tically like adjectives.

NO&amp;quot; structure
As we mentioned in section 3, we extracted the
&amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures which have the same
semantic element, along with similar adjectives,
from large corpora. For example,
KIKEN_NA JOUTAI
(dangerous) (situation)
dangerous situation
In this case &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot; represents the state
concretely.
MIKETTEI NO JOUTAI
(indecision) (of) (situation)
a situation of indecision
In this case, the &amp;quot;MIKETTEI NO (of in-
decision)&amp;quot; also represents the state concretely..
Here, both &amp;quot;KIKENN_NA (dangerous)&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;MIKETTEI NO (of indecision)&amp;quot; have the same
semantic element &amp;quot;state&amp;quot; in common. We find
that a &amp;quot;situation&amp;quot; can be represented by both
an adjective and the &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structure.
When &amp;quot;MIKETTEI NO (of indecision)&amp;quot; co-
occurs with modified nouns other than &amp;quot;situa-
tion&amp;quot;, it, mostly represents the semantic notion,
e.g. &amp;quot;MIKETTEI NO MONDAI (a problem of
indecision)&amp;quot;, and so on. That is, &amp;quot;MIKETTEI
NO (of indecision),&amp;quot; represents the situation of
a problem. So we see that &amp;quot;MIKETTEI NO (of
indecision)&amp;quot; is in itself like an adjective.
On the other hand, &amp;quot;KUMORI NO (cloudi-
ness)&amp;quot; behaves sometimes like an adjective and
sometimes not.
KUMORI NO JOUTAI
(cloudiness) (of) (state)
a state of cloudiness
The semantic behavior of &amp;quot;KUMORI NO
(of cloudiness)&amp;quot; is like the behavior of adjec-
tives in that the cloudiness represents the state
as &amp;quot;KIKEN_NA (dangerous),&amp;quot; however, &amp;quot;KU-
MORI NO (of cloudiness)&amp;quot; does not always rep-
resent the state of the referent of the modified
noun though &amp;quot;MIKETTEI NO (of indecision)&amp;quot;
always represents that. &amp;quot;KUMORI (cloudi-
ness)&amp;quot; is a natural phenomenon which can be
pointed to concretely. For example,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.774818">
KUMORI NO NISSU
(cloudiness) (of) (amount)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99933928">
WA 4 GATU NI SITEWA IJOU DA:
The amount of cloudiness is unusual for April.
In this example, &amp;quot;KUMORI NO (of cloudi-
ness)&amp;quot; modifies &amp;quot;NISSU (the amount),&amp;quot; and
does not represent a state but the possessor of
the amount.
As the examples of &amp;quot;MIKETTEI NO (of
indecision)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;KUMORI NO (of cloudi-
ness)&amp;quot; show, there are nouns which have the
same properties as adjectives intrinsically (e.g.
&amp;quot;MIKETTEI (indecision)&amp;quot;), and other nouns
which intrinsically have different properties
from adjectives (e.g. &amp;quot;KUMORI (cloudiness)&amp;quot;).
So, it is important to consider the properties of
the noun in &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; when we analyze the
&amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; which behaves semantically like
an adjective. Such an analysis enables us to find
the situation in which they act like adjectives.
We classified nouns in &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures
into three types based on what the nouns refer
to. Nouns from the last category, 3), are similar
to adjectives semantically. As adjectives do not
represent concrete objects or verb-like notions,
nouns from these categories only occasionally
resemble adjectives.

e.g. abstract nouns and so on.

As our corpora contain mainly newspaper ar-
ticles, many compound nouns appear. Since the
last word in a compound noun determines the
properties of the whole word, we focus on the
last word in classifying them.
Table 2 contains examples of the noun cate-
gories. &amp;quot;KOUGYOU TOSHI (industry city)&amp;quot; is
an example of a compound noun where the last
word &amp;quot;TOSHI (city)&amp;quot; determines the properties.

In the following section, we analyze the sim-
ilarities and differences of the semantic behav-
ior of &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures and adjectives.
Firstly, we describe the case in which the se-
mantic behavior of &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; is similar to
that of adjectives and then we mention the case
in which the semantic behavior of &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot;
is different from that of adjectives. Secondly, we
analyze several types of nouns in &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot;
which behave like adjectives, even though nouns
in &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; are not intrinsically similar to
adjective types.
5.2 The differences of semantic
behavior between nouns in &amp;quot;noun
NO&amp;quot; and adjectives
For example, &amp;quot;KANASHII (sad)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;URESHII
(pleasurable)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ZANNEN_NA (regrettable)&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;KANASHIMI NO (of sadness)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;YOROKOBI
NO (of delight)&amp;quot; and so on, modify nouns
such as &amp;quot;OMOI (thought)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;KANJI (emo-
tion)&amp;quot; and so on. Using a set of adnomi-
nal constituents, such as &amp;quot;KANASHII (sad)&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;URESHII (pleasurable)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ZANNEN_NA (re-
grettable)&amp;quot;, as keys for classification, we can
classify the modified nouns, &amp;quot;OMOI (thought)&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;KANJI (feeling)&amp;quot; and so on, into the same
group. Then we can find a semantic relation-
ship between these adnorninal constituents and
their head nouns, in this case, &lt;emotion&gt;. In
the following, we describe the similar and dif-
fering semantic behaviors of &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; and
other adjectives in the same semantic category.
As we described in the previous section, we ex-
tract sets of &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures and ad-
jectives from data which was sorted semanti-
cally. Words in each set represent the -seman-
tic substance of the similar nouns which they
modify. Therefore, their semantic categories
are similar. Examples of modified nouns of a
similar semantic category and their modifiers
which have a semantic category similar to that
of the nouns are listed in Table 3. Included are
some &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; examples which though co-
occurring with &lt;mental state&gt; nouns are not
classified as such themselves. There are many
adjectives and nominal adjectivals which can
modify nouns in Table 3, such as &amp;quot;AWARENA
(poor)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;IJIRASHII (moving)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;HOKO-
RASHII (triumphant).&amp;quot; Some &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot;
structures are semantically similar to these ad-
jectives since they represent the contents of the
emotion, e.g. &amp;quot;FUKAI NO KAN (sensation of
displeasure)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;YOROKOBI NO KIMOCHI
(feeling of delight).&amp;quot; Most nouns in these &amp;quot;noun
+ NO&amp;quot; structures in Table 3 are classified into
&amp;quot;mental activity by humans&amp;quot; by the &amp;quot;Word List

egory created by these adnominal constituents
and their modified nouns &amp;quot;Feeling.&amp;quot;
On the other hand, some adnominal rela-
tionships concerning a mental state can only
be represented by &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures,
such as &amp;quot;HOSHIN NO KIMOCHI (desire of de-
fending one&apos;s own interest),&amp;quot; &amp;quot;CHIKUZAI NO
NEN (thought of moneymaking)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;INTAI
NO KIMOCHI (idea of retirement).&amp;quot; Event
nouns are mainly used in these &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot;
structures. Adnominal modifying relations of
&amp;quot;nominalization + NO + mental state_nonn&amp;quot;
structures represent an intentional mental state.
This kind of intentional mental state cannot be
expressed by adjectives. We call this semantic
category &amp;quot;Intentional mental state.&amp;quot;
We discussed two types of semantic represen-
tations above, i.e. Feeling and Intentional men-
tal state. Feeling can be represented by adjec-
tives and &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures. However,
Intentional mental state can be represented
only by &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures. From the
standpoint of the characteristics of the modified
nouns (they represent human mental states),
these two mental activities (Feeling and Inten-
tional mental state) are similar, even though
there are differences in whether the activity is
intentional or not. However, from the stand-
point of the selection of an adnominal relation-
ship in the surface structure, whether the activ-
ity has active intention or not will be the decid-
ing factor for the selection between adjectives
and &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures.
5.3 The case where the semantic
behavior of &amp;quot;noun ± NO&amp;quot;
structures is similar to that of
adjectives
Here we focus on nouns whose properties are
unlike those of adjectives, i.e. the nouns which
refer to concrete objects, verbal notions and so
on.
(I) In the case where &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; represents
characteristics, there is some overlap be-
tween the semantic behavior of adjectives
and &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures.
I) The case where the noun in &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot;
is a compound noun
Let us compare &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; with adjective
usage.

KAWASAKI city which gives a strong im-
pression of an industrial city 4.
In the previous two examples, the differences
between &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; and adjectives depend
only on whether the nouns they modify rep-
resent a person or a city where both head
nouns have characteristics in common. How-
ever, &amp;quot;KOUGYOUTOSHI (industry city)&amp;quot; does
not always have the same semantic relation to
the modified noun, as seen in the following ex-
ample:

In this example, the semantic relation be-
tween &amp;quot;KOUGYOUTOSHI NO (of industry
city)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;YUKYUTI (the vacant land)&amp;quot; indi-
cate the relation of possession so that it is not a
semantic relation that adjectives can represent.
When the modified nouns are abstract nouns
that represent the property (&amp;quot;INSHOU (impres-
sion)&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;SEIKAKU (characteristics)&amp;quot; etc.), or
instances of the concrete nouns in compound
nouns (&amp;quot;KAWASAKI SHI (KAWASAKI city)&amp;quot;),
the semantic function of compound nouns in
&amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; constructions represent the char-
acteristics of the referent of the modified nouns
as adjectives do.
a) Modified nouns which are abstract nouns
that represent a property.

When the modified noun is an instance
of the last word of the modifying com-
pound noun, the semantic function of the
whole compound noun is similar to that
of adjectives because, in this type of com-
pound, we focus on the adjectival semantic
element. For example, &amp;quot;KOUGYOU (indus-
try)&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;KOUGYOUTOSHI (industry city)&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;KOUKYUU (high-quality)&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;KOUKYU-

II) the nouns that refer to the concrete object

Originally the nouns that refer to a concrete
object or event do not have the same meaning as
adjectives, however, they have similar semantic
behavior to that of adjectives in the following
case.

GA TUYOKATTA.
Ordinary people have a strong impression of
environmental pollution from the chemical

The impression the children make is of a

the chemical company makes is of &amp;quot;KANKY-
OUOSEN (environmental pollution)&amp;quot;. These
&amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures represent the charac-
teristics of children and a company in same
manner that the adjective &amp;quot;mild&amp;quot; indicates his
characteristic. In these examples, nouns in
&amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; represent objects and events and
so on, i.e. &amp;quot;HINOKI-tree&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;environmental
pollution&amp;quot; these nouns ordinarily do not behave
like adjectives. That is, the adjective &amp;quot;mild&amp;quot;
can represent a characteristic directly, however,
these nouns in &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; cannot represent
the characteristics of something directly. We
cannot say &amp;quot;that children are HINOKI-tree&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;the company is the environmental pollu-
tion&amp;quot; while we can say &amp;quot;He is mild.&amp;quot; That is, in
this case, &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; cannot appear in the
predicative position with this meaning. When
we show the characteristics of something by us-
ing nouns that refer to concrete objects and
events, we need to specify the modified nouns
which indicate the characteristics like &amp;quot;impres-

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936166666667">
In this paper, we discussed the similarities
and differences among adnominal constituents,
i.e. adjectives and &amp;quot;noun + NO&amp;quot; structures
which have a broad range of semantic functions.
Nouns and adjectives differ in part of speech,
but they sometimes have similarities when used
adnominally. In such a case, we need not dis-
tinguish them from each other semantically. We
investigated explicit criteria to detect similari-
ties and differences between nouns and adjec-
tives in adnominal usage. This research was ver-
ified by using large corpora and a self-organizing
mapping system based on the neural network
model. In future work, we will attempt to sys-
tematically classify words used adnominally ac-
cording to the semantic behavior of adnominal
constituents following the theoretical insights of
Pustejovsky.
