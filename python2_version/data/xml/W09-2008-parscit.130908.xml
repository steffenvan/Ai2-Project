1 Curveship and Its Contexts
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916705882353">
This paper addresses those interested in aesthetic
and computational, work with language, whether
or not they are familiar with interactive fiction or
narrative theory. I describe the twofold motivation
behind Curveship, explaining why I find interac-
tive fiction compelling and why I find narrative
variation a worthwhile capability for a literary
computer system. I then sketch the way that
Curveship works, pointing to aspects of the system
that will, I hope, interest interactive fiction authors
and also have relevance beyond interactive fiction.
Several histories of interactive fiction are avail-
able, including book-length (Montfort 2003) and
briefer ones (Nelson 2001, Montfort 2007a). This
paper focuses on how interactive fiction works,
and on explaining its conventions, rather than on
detailing the history of the first interactive fiction,
Adventure (written in 1976 by Will Crowther and
Don Woods), the “mainframe” games that
followed, interactive fiction in the commercial
marketplace (including the many notable
contributions of Infocom), and the surge in
development by individual, non-commercial inter-
active fiction authors. This paper also doesn’t pro-
vide any information about how to download or
run interactive fiction, and very little about how to
play it, although several FAQs and other resources
are available online with that information (IFWiki
2009, Aiken 2008, Cadre n.d.).
After offering some of the motivation for this
work, this paper provides a high-level introduction
to Curveship and its capabilities. The details on
narrative variation and on how it has been imple-
mented computationally are available in the

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999894352941176">
Interactive fiction (often called “IF”) is a ven-
erable thread of creative computing that in-
cludes Adventure, Zork, and the computer
game The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy as
well as innovative recent work. These pro-
grams are usually known as “games,” appro-
priately, but they can also be rich forms of
text-based computer simulation, dialog sys-
tems, and examples of computational literary
art. Theorists of narrative have long distin-
guished between the level of underlying con-
tent or story (which can usefully be seen as
corresponding to the simulated world in inter-
active fiction) and that of expression or dis-
course (corresponding to the textual exchange
between computer and user). While IF devel-
opment systems have offered a great deal of
power and flexibility to author/programmers
by providing a computational model of the
fictional world, previous systems have not
systematically distinguished between the tell-
ing and what is told. Developers were not able
to control the content and expression levels
independently so that they could, for instance,
have a program relate events out of chrono-
logical order or have it relate events from the
perspective of different characters. Curveship
is an interactive fiction system which draws
on narrative theory and computational linguis-
tics to allow the transformation of the narrat-
ing in these ways. This talk will briefly
describe interactive fiction, narrative varia-
tion, and how Curveship provides new capa-
bilities for interactive fiction authors.

interface to the system has been streamlined and
other changes are being made to facilitate the use
of Curveship by interactive fiction authors, the ap-

2 The Interactive Fiction Tradition

<bodyText confidence="0.99987525">
Since the release of the first work of interactive
fiction in 1976, those working in the form have
developed conventions and traditions and have
undertaken many different sorts of exploration and
innovation.
A snippet of a transcript from this author’s
Book and Volume (2005) gives a basic idea of what
interaction is like:

Someone, perhaps nWare’s monarchically
wealthy founder, shellf, really got into Dark
City. There couldn’t be any other excuse for
this combination vending machine and cafe-
teria, even though it may strain to look mod-
ern and appetizing. Pixelated smiley faces in
an urgent red decorate everything, even the
edges of the food-dispensing wall.
The opportunity to avoid social contact dur-
ing food selection is appealing.
&gt;buy some food
Food does seem like a good idea. You select
something palatable from the food-
dispensing wall and begin to consume it,
face flickering with mammalian happiness.
A guy you met during new employee reori-
entation -- Knut, you think his name is -- fur-
tively joins you as you’re dining. He looks
even more feverish and high-strung than he
did a few days ago.
“Hi. Hi again. Gotta tell. Tell you some-
thing.”
Here, the player character — the one controlled by
the player via textual commands — begins in the
lobby of his apartment building. The player then
types a command for that character to “leave,”
which he does, ending up outside at an intersec-
tion. Because the player character happens to be
carrying his laptop computer, which is turned on,
an annoying animated agent appears and dispenses
some advice. The next command, “go to the auto-
mat,” directs the character to enter a different
building. (“Go northwest,” “walk northwest,”
“northwest,” or simply “nw” would have all done
the same thing.) Finally, the character is com-
manded to “buy some food,” which the character
does — something that is only possible because the
character has his electronic cash device, isn’t sated,
and is in place where food is sold. Although these
are not dramatically interesting actions, they, in

this game and in others, can be part of figuring out
the nature of an unusual world.
Of course, not every input works as smoothly
as these did in this context. Actions often work if
they are warranted by the situation in some way; so
“buy some food” is appropriate in an automat
while “donate my organs to science” isn’t. A char-
acter can be commanded to walk in a particular
direction, or to enter a building that is nearby, but
not, usually, to “go to Tangiers.” And there is usu-
ally no need for fine-grained positioning or de-
scribing the manner in which an action is done, so
instead of issuing the command “hop spryly over
to the coffee table” to prepare for setting down
one’s mug, it’s fine to just go directly to typing
“put my mug on the coffee table.”
Moving a character around using compass di-
rections is a very notable convention originating
with Adventure, although there were other ways to
get around in that game. However it’s done, trav-
ersing a virtual space is very important to interac-
tive fiction.
There are four important characteristics of in-
teractive fiction that make it interesting from a re-
search standpoint as well as from the standpoint of
poetics. A work of interactive fiction is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9218162">
• A limited domain that serves as a simu-
lated “microworld.” It has a complete model of the
things that can be manipulated in the simulation
and can be usefully talked about.
• A dialog system. Natural language is pro-
vided as output, and the system accepts commands
that, although simple and short, are instances of
English text.
• A computer game, providing enjoyment
and fun. Although not the preeminent form of
computer entertainment today, as it was around
1980, interactive fiction is something that many
people find enjoyable and interact with for its own
sake.
• A form of aesthetic expression and literary
art. As with any form or medium, only a few use a
significant amount of this potential. But the com-
putational, literary nature of interactive fiction
gives it the capability to do aesthetic work that
could not otherwise be done.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878765957447">
Since many people don’t realize that interactive
fiction extends beyond the cave setting and fantasy
genre, it’s worth mentioning a few examples of
work from the last few years, work that gives an
idea of the range of interactive fiction today — all
of which is available for free download and easily
found online:
Anchorhead, by Michael Gentry, 1998: An ex-
pansive interactive fiction with deep secrets and
action that runs over several days, inspired in tone
and style by H. P. Lovecraft.
Bad Machine, by Dan Shovitz, 1998: Manifest-
ing itself as confusing a mix of status reports, error
messages, this interactive fiction takes place in a
strange robot-run factory.
Narcolepsy, by Adam Cadre, 2003: A seem-
ingly contemporary, ordinary interactive fiction
that branches hilariously into strange genre scenar-
ios.
Slouching toward Bedlam, by Star C. Foster
and Daniel Ravipinto, 2003: A steampunk science
fiction piece set in an asylum and involving tech-
nological and kabbalistic themes.
Savoir-Faire, by Emily Short, 2002: The return
to a childhood home provides opportunities to re-
member the past and requires that the player figure
out an intricate system of sympathetic magic.
Spider and Web, by Andrew Plotkin, 1998: A
science-fiction spy thriller that has the player reen-
act past events to the satisfaction of an interroga-
tor.
Interactive fiction as it exists now is a type of
virtual reality, a simulation of not only a space and
the characters and things in that space but also of
physical and metaphysical laws that obtain in a
world. Furthermore, it’s a virtual reality that works
well, one in which conventions have evolved about
the level of abstraction and the types of commands
that will work. An effective way of interacting has
been negotiated.
Although more could be done to better simulate
a world and to better understand language in inter-
active fiction, the Curveship project has a different
goal. Curveship is being developed to add to inter-
active fiction’s well-established capability for
simulation a new capability for narration, one that
will allow the telling to be parametrically varied.

lowing control over settings, characters, and the

incidents that happen, they have provided very use-
ful facilities. However, literary works are not pow-
erful and compelling merely because of what
happens in them. They also rely on these events
being told in an interesting way, on the different
types of narrating that can be done. The interactive
fiction system I am describing, Curveship, uses
natural language generation to allow the narrating
to be varied parametrically. To understand why
this is a significant capability, it is worth turning to
non-digital novels, stories, and narrative poems to
see how they accomplish their effects.
We may consider different novels, stories, and
poems to be “great” — powerful, affecting, trans-
forming, deeply pleasing to read — but whichever
ones we prefer, it is unlikely that we appreciate
them simply because of what happens in them. The
way these events are narrated is also important. A
paraphrase or summary is generally not considered
to be as interesting as is a great work of literature,
even an ancient one. A timeline of events would
hardly compare to The Odyssey, in which Odys-
seus tells some of the events himself, in which he
weeps as he hears a bard, who does not know
Odysseus’s identity, relating the events of the Tro-
jan War and his own exploits to him. This is not to
say that there can be no interesting retellings of
The Odyssey, only that any telling will be interest-
ing or not based on how the narrating is done.
The study of narrating, of how the same under-
lying events can be told in different ways, has been
undertaken systematically in the field of narrative
theory or narratology, in which the distinction be-
tween story/content and discourse, between that

or with different frequency, speed, and order (below).

<bodyText confidence="0.999975666666667">
which is narrated the narrative itself, has been
central. Specifically, the model that Gérard Genette
presents in Figures III, translated into English as
Narrative Discourse (Genette 1980) and later re-
vised in Narrative Discourse Revisited (Genette
1988), has provided the basis for narrative varia-
tion in Curveship.
A variant of a simple story given as an example
by E. M. Foster is represented in figure 1. There
are five underlying events: The death of the king,
the grieving of the queen, the death of the queen,
the usurping of the throne by a clown, and the
laughing of the jester. These can be told one after
another in their chronological order, as the top part
of the diagram shows. But it is also possible to nar-
rate the same underlying contest by saying “The
king and queen died. The jester laughed — after
the clown usurped the throne.” This telling repre-
sented in the bottom part of the diagram, and cor-
responds to changes in three of Genette’s
categories: frequency (whether there is one telling
per event, one for several events, or several for one
event), speed (how rapidly or slowly events are
related), and order (the sequence in which events
are represented as compared to their chronological
order in the story world). In this case, the king and
queen’s death are both narrated with a single
statement, a change in frequency; the queen’s grief
is skipped over as rapidly as is possible and thus
omitted entirely, a change in speed; and the
clown’s usurping of the throne is mentioned last,
after the jester’s laughter, which it apparently oc-
casioned — a change in order.
Genette describes several other categories of
variation, two of which are important for this pa-
per. The time of narrating describes the temporal
relationship between the narrating and the events
of the story. For instance, in “I was driving down
the road and it started raining frogs” the narrating
is happening after the events, but a different (and
still perfectly plausible) telling of this story, “So
I’m driving down the road and all of the sudden it
starts raining frogs,” the narrating and the events
take place at the same time, giving a more immedi-
ate feel to the narrative. We could gloss this differ-
ent as one of “past tense” and “present tense,” but
this simple reference to grammar breaks down as a
story gets more complex. If the narrator-character
were to continue by noting “I had just had the
wiper blades replaced” in the first case and “I just
had the wiper blades replaced,” the story would no

longer be entirely in the simple present or simple
past. The important difference here, although it is
reflected in the grammar, is actually a narrative
one.
Focalization, briefly, describes the way that the
information available to the narrator is regulated. If
the narrative follows a character and tells us only
what that character knows, it is focalized by that
character. Whether the character is referred to in
the main level of the narrative as “I,” in the third
person (as in a typical Hemingway story), or even
as “you” (the standard case in interactive fiction) is
a separate matter. Specifically, that has to do with
who the narrator and naratee are and if there are
characters within the story who have this role.

4 The Architecture of Curveship
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999715909090909">
State-of-the-art IF systems (including TADS 3
and Inform 7) have innovated in many ways, but
they are similar in offering two main modules, the
“parser,” which deals with recognizing intended
actions based on typed user input, and the rest of
the program, which handles both the simulation of
the IF world and the narrating of events and
description of existents in that world.
Curveship has a parser as well (the Recognizer)
but, as shown in figure 2, it is further separated
into modules that deal with different functions the
interactive fiction system and program have to
carry out. Significantly, it has separate Simulator
and Narrator modules. The Simulator is potentially
independent of the human language of a particular
interactive fiction, although Curveship has only
been implemented in English as yet. It updates the
world models to reflect the new state of the under-
lying simulated world and the new theories that
characters have about this world. Then, the Narra-
tor module, which is quite specific to a particular
human language, builds a narrative reply using a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997371">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999764294117647">
world model and a plan for narrating. The Simula-
tor is the only module that updates the world mod-
els. Similarly, the discourse model is written only
by the Recognizer (which updates this model to
reflect the user’s contributions to the discourse)
and the Narrator (which produces the system’s
contributions to the discourse and updates the
model to reflect these).
Curveship’s somewhat unusual name is meant
to call attention to how the system models the es-
sential qualities of variation — the curve of a story
through its telling — just as friendship and author-
ship represent the essence of being a friend and
author.1 The word “curveship” was coined by Hart
Crane (1899-1932) in the last line of his poem “To
Brooklyn Bridge,” in which he addresses the
bridge: “And of the curveship lend a myth to God.”

5 Order and Time of Narrating
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997962962963">
The order of events as narrated does not have to
correspond to the order of events in a fictional,
simulated, or historical world. Genette represents
the order of events in the narrating as a sequqnce,
of the form “3451267,” but he also notes that
events can be reordered in many different ways,
for different purposes and to different effects. For
instance, in “3451267,” the earliest two events,
“12,” may have been narrated as what is com-
monly called flashback (which Genette calls an
analepsis). But perhaps not: perhaps “345,” “12,”
and “67” all fell into different categories, and the
narration was done according to these categories
— using syllepsis, in Genette’s system. Or, per-
haps the events have been jumbled at random to
confuse the reader about their temporal relation-
ship; this is called achrony. Cue words and tense
will be used differently in these three cases, so
“3451267” is not an adequate representation when
text is to be generated, rather than just analyzed.
Instead of representing the order of events in the
narrative as a sequence, Curveship uses an ordered
tree representation called a reply structure. It de-
scribes not only the sequence of events but also
which level each event is at and what its relation-
ship is to the level above. To determine the tense,
the system uses a theory that relates how three

than the name the system previously had, during the main

points in time — speech time (S), reference time
(R), and event time (E) — correspond to a particu-
lar grammatical tense (Reichenbach 1947). Event
time is supplied by the simulator; the other two
times are determined based on the plan for narrat-
ing and the reply structure as text generation are
done. The reply structure representation allows for
different orderings to be composed, so, for in-
stance, within a flashforward, the events can be
jumbled achronously, and within each sylleptic
category the narration can be done in a different
temporal way.

6 Focalization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.950136166666667">
Curveship implements a system for changing fo-
calization based on Marie Laure-Ryan’s concept of
a Fictional Actual World which the reader re-
centers upon (Ryan 2001). In the formulation of
this concept for interactive fiction, it is useful to
consider an Interactive Fiction Actual World that
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990538461539">
represents what is actual, or real, to the characters
in the game. Each character, then — each potential
focalizer — has his or her own world model, a the-
ory of this world which may be mistaken and al-
most certainly is partial. The Narrator, then, never
even sees the underlying simulation, but instead
relates events based on the focalizer’s current the-
ory of the world.
Because the Narrator may tell about things that
happened before the current state of the world,
each focalizer maintains not only a current theory
of the world but also a history of how the world
appeared in the past.

7 Text Generation in Curveship
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999822441176471">
The Narrator, which does text generation in Curve-
ship, is organized into a standard three-stage pipe-
line. First comes the highest-level operation of
content selection and ordering, which is done by
the Reply Planner (essentially a document planner,
but here part of a discourse is being planned).
Then, the Microplanner determines the grammati-
cal specifics of the output based on the plan for
narrating. Finally, the Realizer accepts the para-
graph proposals from the Microplanner and pro-
duces a string.
The problem of authoring for generation is a
difficult one. Interactive fiction authors would like
to be able to write as they do now, simply associat-
ing strings with objects and events. This represen-
tation is not suitable for the generation task,
however. Something more general is needed to
allow narrative variation to be automatically pro-
duced.
Advanced research and commercial text genera-
tion system use highly abstract representations of
sentences (different ones for each system) to allow
text to be flexibly transformed, aggregated, and
changed in tense, aspect, and person. While the
power of this approach is unquestionable, taking
this direction is also unsuitable, because it would
require a tremendous investment on the part of
authors, who would spend perhaps a hundred times
the time and effort to create the same textual out-
put that they could jot off in the typical interactive
fiction system. It is unlikely that anyone would
undertake this voluntarily, and, if people did, it
would almost certainly disrupt the authorship proc-
ess.

Figure 4. The Narrator module uses a standard
three-stage pipeline for text generation.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999063785714286">
As a compromise, Curvseship uses a string-
with-slots representation that offers significant
flexibility in generation without the extreme com-
plexity of most sentence representations. It allows
authors to “cheat” and indicate that something
should be treated as an entity in the discourse even
if there is no model of it in the simulation. For in-
stance, the text at the beginning of Adventure can
be generated from the following strings:
‘S_FC V_stand_PROG at the_end of
a_road before
a_small_brick_building’
‘a_small_stream V_flow_S out of
the_building and down a_gully’
The first slot, S_FC, indicates that the focaliz-
ing character is to be named there (pronominalized
if appropriate) and will be the subject of the sen-
tence. The next, V_stand_PROG, says that the verb
“stand” is to appear in the progressive. It is not
necessary to specify the number; without such a
specification, the verb will agree in number with
the subject. The rest of the first string looks ordi-
nary, except that noun phrases have been con-
nected with underscores. This indicates that they
should be treated as entities in the discourse even
though they are not simulated: The system will, for
instance, output “a road” the first time around and,
since the road is then given in the discourse, it will
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997137">
61
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941">
output “the road” afterwards. Finally, in the second
string, there is the slot V_flow_S. The subject of
the sentence is not indicated, but it is not neces-
sary, since the “_S” indicates that the verb “flow”
should be output in the singular.
Depending on the plan for narrating and the
state of the discourse, this can produce:
You are standing at the end of a road before a
small brick building. A small stream flows out
of the building and down a gully.
As well as:
You were standing at the end of the road be-
fore the small brick building. The small stream
flowed out of the building and down the gully.
Along with more exotic strings that result from
unusual narrative settings and the use of text fil-
ters.

In the formulation of this concept for interactive fiction, it is useful to consider an Interactive Fiction Actual World that 60 represents what is actual, or real, to the characters in the game. Each character, then — each potential focalizer — has his or her own world model, a theory of this world which may be mistaken and almost certainly is partial. The Narrator, then, never even sees the underlying simulation, but instead relates events based on the focalizer’s current theory of the world.
