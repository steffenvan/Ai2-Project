<bodyText confidence="0.999966142857143">
We describe an approach to improving
the naturalness of a social dialogue sys-
tem, Talkie, by adding disfluencies and
other content-independent enhancements
to synthesized conversations. We investi-
gated whether listeners perceive conversa-
tions with these improvements as natural
(i.e., human-like) as human-human con-
versations. We also assessed their ability
to correctly identify these conversations as
between humans or computers. We find
that these enhancements can improve the
perceived naturalness of conversations for
observers “overhearing” the dialogues.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972289473684">
An enduring problem in spoken dialogue systems
research is how to make conversations between
humans and computers approach the naturalness
of human-human conversations. Although this
has been addressed in several goal-oriented dia-
logue systems (e.g., for tutoring, question answer-
ing, etc.), social dialogue systems (i.e., non-task-
oriented) have not significantly advanced beyond
so-called “chatbots”. Proper social dialogue sys-
tems (Bickmore and Cassell, 2004; Higuchi et
al., 2002) would be able to conduct open con-
versations, without being restricted to particular
domains. Such systems would find use in many
environments (e.g., human-robot interaction, en-
tertainment technology).
This paper presents an approach to improving a
social dialogue system capable of chatting about
the news by adding content-independent enhance-
ments to speech. We hypothesize that enhance-
ments such as explicit acknowledgments (e.g.,
right, so, well) and disfluencies can make human-
computer conversations sound indistinguishable
from those between two humans.
Enhancements to synthesized speech have been
found to influence perception of a synthetic
voice’s hesitation (Carlson et al., 2006) and per-
sonality (Nass and Lee, 2001). Andersson et
al. (2010) used machine learning techniques to
determine where to include conversational phe-
nomena to improve synthesized speech. Adell et
al. (2007) developed methods for inserting filled
pauses into synthesized speech that listeners found
more natural. In these studies, human judges com-
pared utterances in isolation with and without im-
provements. In our study, we focus on a holistic
evaluation of naturalness in dialogues and ask ob-
servers to directly assess the naturalness of con-
versations that they “overhear”.

2 The Talkie System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909190476191">
Talkie is a spoken dialogue system capable of hav-
ing open conversations about recent topics in the
news. This system was developed for a dialogue
systems course (Lim et al., 2009). Interaction
is intended to be unstructured and free-flowing,
much like social conversations. Talkie initiates a
conversation by mentioning a recent news head-
line and invites the user to comment on it.
The system uses a database of news topics and
human-written comments from the “most blogged
about articles” of the New York Times (NYT)1.
Comments are divided into single sentences to ap-
proximate the length of a spoken response. Given
a user’s utterance (e.g., keywords related to the
topic), Talkie responds with the comment that
most closely resembles that utterance. Talkie may
access any comment related to the topic under dis-
cussion (without repetition). The user may choose
to switch to a different topic at any time (at which
point Talkie will propose a different topic from its
set).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988769230769">
We performed a study to determine if the per-
ceived naturalness of conversations could be im-
proved by using heuristic enhancements to speech
output. Participants “overheard” conversations
(similar to Walker et al. (2004)). Originally typed
interactions, the conversations were later synthe-
sized into speech using the Flite speech synthesis
engine (Black and Lenzo, 2001). For distinctive-
ness, conversations were between one male voice
(rms) and one female voice (slt). The voices were
generated using the CLUSTERGEN statistical para-
metric synthesizer (Black, 2006). All conversa-
tions began with the female voice.

3.1 Dialogue Content
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990380952381">
We considered four different conversation types:
(1 &amp; 2) between a human and Talkie (human-
computer and computer-human depending on the
first speaker), (3) between two humans on a
topic in Talkie’s database (human-human), and
(4) between two instances of Talkie (computer-
computer). The human-computer and computer-
human conditions differed from each other by
one utterance; that is, one was a shifted version
of the other by one dialogue turn. The human-
computer conversations were collected from two
people (one native English speaker, one native
Portuguese speaker) interacting with Talkie on
separate occasions. For human-human conversa-
tions, Talkie proposed a topic for discussion. Each
conversation contained ten turns of dialogue. To
remove any potential effects from the start and end
content of the conversations, we selected the mid-
dle three turns for synthesis. Each conversation
type had five conversations, each about one of five
recent headlines (as of May 2010).

<bodyText confidence="0.999987142857143">
We defined a set of rules that added phenomena
observed in human-human spoken conversations.
These included filled pauses, word repetitions, si-
lences, and explicit acknowledgments. Conversa-
tions in this study were enhanced manually by fol-
lowing the set of rules described in Figure 1; an
example is shown in Figure 2.

sions that we counterbalanced across participants:
the four conversation “types” described in Section
3.1, the order of the five topics, and the presence
or absence of heuristic enhancements to the syn-
thesized speech that participants heard. Each par-
ticipant listened to every topic such that exactly
five participants heard each condition.
Participants made two judgments per conversa-
tion: rating the “naturalness” of a conversation
based on a four-point Likert scale and ranking
the conversant identities (i.e., as two humans, two
computers, or a computer and a human) from most
to least confident. We used the non-parametric
Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance to
determine statistically significant differences in
naturalness responses across groups (naturalness
being the dependent measure).

We analyzed two measures: (1) naturalness rat-

believed to be the speakers in each conversation.
We found no statistically significant ordering ef-

no statistically significant difference in naturalness
ratings for the computer-human condition com-
pared to the human-computer condition (H(1) =
2.94; p = 0.09). Also, the computer-computer
condition was significantly different from all other
conditions, suggesting that conversation flow is an
important factor in determining the naturalness of
a conversation (H(3) = 42.49, p &lt; 0.05).
People rated conversations involving a com-
puter and a human similarly to human-human con-
versations (without enhancements). There were
no statistically significant differences between the
three conditions cc, ch, and hc (H(2) = 5.36, p =
0.06). However, a trend indicated that hc natural-
ness ratings differed from those of the ch and hh
conditions. Conversations from the hc condition
had much lower (18%) mean naturalness ratings
compared to their ch counterparts, even though
they were nearly equivalent in content.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980274">
4.2 Heuristic Enhancements Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98688358">
There were significant differences in naturalness
ratings when heuristic enhancements were present
(H(1) = 17.49, p &lt; 0.05). Figure 4 shows that
the perceived naturalness was on average higher
with heuristic enhancements. Overall, mean natu-
ralness improved by 20%. This result agrees with
findings from Andersson et al. (2010).
Computer-computer conversations had the
highest relative improvement (42%) in mean nat-
uralness. Naturalness ratings were significantly
different when comparing these conversations
with and without enhancements (H(1) = 11.77, p
&lt; 0.05). Content-free conversational phenomena
appear to compensate for the lack of logical flow
in these conversations. According to Figure 5,
after enhancements people are no better than
chance at correctly determining the speakers in
a computer-computer conversation. Thus the
heuristic enhancements clearly affect naturalness
judgments.
Even the naturalness of conversations with good
logical flow can improve with heuristic adjust-
ments; there was a 26% relative improvement in
the mean naturalness of human-human conver-
sations. Participant ratings of naturalness were
again significantly different (H(1) = 12.45, p &lt;
0.05). Note that these conversations were origi-
nally typed dialogue. As such, they did not capture
turn-taking properties present in conversational
speech. When enhanced with conversational phe-
nomena, they more closely resembled natural spo-
ken conversations. As shown in Figure 5, people
are more likely than chance to correctly identify
two humans as being the participants in the di-
alogue after these enhancements were applied to
speech.
Conversations with one computer and one hu-
man also benefited from heuristic enhancements.
Improvements in naturalness were marginal, how-
ever. Naturalness scores in the hc condition im-
proved by 16%, but this improvement was only
a trend (H(1) = 3.66, p = 0.06). Improvement
was negligible in the ch condition. Participants
selected the correct speakers in human-computer
dialogues no better than random. We note that
participants tended to avoid ranking conversations
as “human &amp; computer” with confidence (i.e., the
highest rank). A significant majority (267 out of
400) of second-rank selections were “human &amp;
computer.” Participants tended to order conditions

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975291666667">
We have shown that content-independent heuris-
tics can be used to improve the perceived natural-
ness of conversations. Our conversations sampled
a variety of interactions using Talkie, a social di-
alogue system that converses about recent news
headlines. An experiment examined the factors
that could influence how external judges rate the
naturalness of these conversations.
We found that without enhancements, people
rated conversations involving a human and a com-
puter similarly to conversations involving two hu-
mans. Adding heuristic enhancements produced
different results, depending on the conversation
type: computer-computer and human-human con-
versations had the best gain in naturalness scores.
Though it remains to be seen if people are always
influenced by such enhancements, they are clearly
useful for improving the naturalness of human-
computer dialogues.
Future work will involve developing methods to
automatically inject enhancements into the synthe-
sized speech output produced by Talkie, as well
as determining whether other types of systems can
benefit from these techniques.

Participants “overheard” conversations (similar to Walker et al. (2004)). Originally typed interactions, the conversations were later synthesized into speech using the Flite speech synthesis engine (Black and Lenzo, 2001). For distinctiveness, conversations were between one male voice (rms) and one female voice (slt). The voices were generated using the CLUSTERGEN statistical parametric synthesizer (Black, 2006). All conversations began with the female voice. 3.1 Dialogue Content We considered four different conversation types: (1 &amp; 2) between a human and Talkie (humancomputer and computer-human depending on the first speaker), (3) between two humans on a topic in Talkie’s database (human-human), and (4) between two instances of Talkie (computercomputer).

Such systems would find use in many environments (e.g., human-robot interaction, entertainment technology). This paper presents an approach to improving a social dialogue system capable of chatting about the news by adding content-independent enhancements to speech. We hypothesize that enhancements such as explicit acknowledgments (e.g., right, so, well) and disfluencies can make humancomputer conversations sound indistinguishable from those between two humans. Enhancements to synthesized speech have been found to influence perception of a synthetic voice’s hesitation (Carlson et al., 2006) and personality (Nass and Lee, 2001). Andersson et al. (2010) used machine learning techniques to determine where to include conversational phenomena to improve synthesized speech. Adell et al. (2007) developed methods for inserting filled pauses into synthesized speech that listeners found more natural. In these studies, human judges compared utterances in isolation with and without improvements. In our study, we focus on a holistic evaluation of naturalness in dialogues and ask observers to directly assess the naturalness of conversations that they “overhear”. 2 The Talkie System Talkie is </context>

This system was developed for a dialogue systems course (Lim et al., 2009). Interaction is intended to be unstructured and free-flowing, much like social conversations. Talkie initiates a conversation by mentioning a recent news headline and invites the user to comment on it. The system uses a database of news topics and human-written comments from the “most blogged about articles” of the New York Times (NYT)1. Comments are divided into single sentences to approximate the length of a spoken response. Given a user’s utterance (e.g., keywords related to the topic), Talkie responds with the comment that most closely resembles that utterance. Talkie may access any comme</context>
