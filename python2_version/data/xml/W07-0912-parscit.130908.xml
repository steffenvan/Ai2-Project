Lessons from the MALACH Project:
Applying new technologies to improve intellectual access to large oral history collections
Douglas W. Oard, University of Maryland, USA
Abstract:
In this talk I will describe the goals of the MALACH project (Multilingual Access to
Large Spoken Archives) and our research results. I’ll begin by describing the unique
characteristics of the oral history collection that we used, in which Holocaust survivors,
witnesses and rescuers were interviewed in several languages. Each interview has been
digitized and extensively catalogued by subject matter experts, thus producing a
remarkably rich collection for the application of machine learning techniques. Automatic
speech recognition techniques originally developed for the domain of conversational
telephone speech were adapted to process these materials with word error rates that are
adequate to provide useful features to support interactive search and automated
clustering, boundary detection, and topic classification tasks. As I describe our results, I
will focus particularly on the evaluation methods that that we have used to assess the
potential utility of this technology. I’ll conclude with some remarks about possible future
directions for research on applying new technologies to improve intellectual access to
oral history and other spoken word collections. This is joint work with Charles
University (Prague), IBM Research (T.J. Watson), the Johns Hopkins University
(Baltimore), the University of Southern California (Los Angeles), an the University of
West Bohemia (Pilsen),
About the Speaker:
Douglas Oard is Associate Dean for Research at the College of Information Studies of the
University of Maryland, College Park, where he holds joint appointments as Associate
Professor in the College of Information Studies and in the Institute for Advanced
Computer Studies. He earned his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of
Maryland, and his research interests center around the use of emerging technologies to
support information seeking by end users. Dr. Oard’s recent work has focused on
interactive techniques for cross­language information retrieval, searching conversational
media, and leveraging observable behavior to improve user modeling. Additional
