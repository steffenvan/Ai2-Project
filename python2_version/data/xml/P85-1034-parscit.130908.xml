Humans know a great deal about relationships among
words. This paper discusses relationships among word
pronunciations. We describe a computer system which
models human judgement of rhyme by assigning specific
roles to the location of primary stress, the similarity of
phonetic segments, and other factors. By using the
model as an experimental tool, we expect to improve our
understanding of rhyme. A related computer model will
attempt to generate pronunciations for unknown words
by analogy with those for known words. The analogical
processes involve techniques for segmenting and
matching word spellings, and for mapping spelling to
sound in known words. As in the case of rhyme, the
computer model will be an important tool for improving
our understanding of these processes. Both models serve
as the basis for functions in the WordSmith automated
dictionary system.

This paper describes work undertaken in the develop-
ment of WordSmith, an automated dictionary system
being built by the Lexical Systems group at the IBM T.
J. Watson Research Center. WordSmith allows the user
to explore a multidimensional space of information
about words. The system permits interaction with lexi-
cal databases through a set of programs that carry out
functions such as displaying formatted entries from a
standard dictionary and generating pronunciations for a
word not found in the dictionary. WordSmith also
shows the user words that are &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; to a given word
along dimensions such as spelling (as in published dic-
tionaries), meaning (as in thesauruses), and sound (as in
rhyming dictionaries).
Figure 1 shows a sample of the WordSmith user inter-
face. The current word, urgency, labels the text box at
the center of the screen. The box contains the output
of the PRONUNC application applied to the current
word; it shows the pronunciation of urgency and the
mapping between the word&apos;s spelling and pronunciation.
PRONUNC represents pronunciations in an alphabet
derived from Webster&apos;s Seventh Collegiate Dictionary. In
the pronunciation shown I&apos;s&amp;quot; represents the vowel
schwa, and &amp;quot;&gt;&amp;quot; marks the vowel in the syllable bearing
primary stress. Spelling-to-pronunciation mappings will
be described in Section 3.
Three dimensions, displaying words that are neighbors
of urgency, pass through the text box. Dimension one.
extending from uriede to urinometric, contains words
from the PRONUNC data base which are close to ur-
gency in alphabetical order. The second dimension
(from somebody to company) shows words which are
likely to rhyme with urgency. Dimension three (from
pudency to pruriency) is based on a reverse alphabetical
ordering of words, and displays words whose spellings
end similarly to urgency. The RHYME and REVERSE
dimensions are discussed below.

Section 2 describes the construction of the WordSmith
rhyming dimension, which is based on an encoding pro-
cedure for representing pronunciations. The encoding
procedure is quite flexible, and we believe it can be used
as a research tool to investigate the linguistic and
psycholinguistic structure of syllables and words. Sec-
tion 3 outlines a program for generating a pronunciation
of an unknown word based on pronunciations of known
words. There is evidence (Rosson. 1985) that readers
sometimes generate a pronunciation for an unfamiliar
letter string based on analogy to stored lexical &amp;quot;neigh-
bors&amp;quot; of the string, i.e. actual words that differ only
slightly in spelling from the unfamiliar string. A program
which generates pronunciations by analogy might serve
as a supplement to programs that use spelling-to-sound
rules in applications such as speech synthesis (Thomas,
et al., 1984), or it might be used to find rhyming words,
in WordSmith&apos;s rhyming dimension, for an unknown
word.

2. Rhyme
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982868538461539">
The WordSmith rhyme dimension is based on two files.
The first is a main file keyed on the spelling of words
arranged in alphabetical order and containing the words&apos;
pronunciations organized according to part of speech.
This same file serves as the data base for the
PRONUNC application and dimension shown in Figure
1. The second file is an index to the first. It is keyed on
encoded pronunciations and contains pointers to words
in the main file that have the indicated pronunciations.
If a single pronunciation corresponds to multiple
spellings in the main file, then there will be multiple
pointers, one for each spelling. Thus, this index file also
serves as a list of homophones. The order of the en-
coded pronunciations in the index file defines the rhym-
ing dimension so that words which are close to one
another in this file are more likely to rhyme than words
which are far apart.
The original motivation for the encoding used to obtain
the rhyme dimension comes from published reverse dic-
tionaries, some of which (e.g., Walker, 1924) even call
themselves &amp;quot;rhyming dictionaries&amp;quot;. Such reverse dic-
tionaries are obtained from a word list by (a) writing the
words right-to-left, instead of left-to-right. (b) doing a
normal alphabetic sort on the reversed spellings, and (c)
restoring the original left-to-right orientation of the
words in the resulting sorted list. This procedure was
used to derive the REVERSE dimension shown in Fig-
ure 1.
There are several problems with using reverse diction-
aries as the basis for determining rhymes. First, since
English spelling allows multiple ways of writing the same
sounds, words that in fact do rhyme may be located far
apart in the dictionary. Second, since English allows a
given spelling to be pronounced in multiple ways, words
that are close to one another in the dictionary will not
necessarily rhyme with each other. Third, the location
of primary stress is a crucial factor in determining if two
words rhyme (Rickert, 1978). Primary stress is not en-
coded in the spelling of words. As an extreme example
of this failure of reverse dictionaries, note that the verb
record does not rhyme with the noun record. Fourth,
basing rhyme on the reverse linear arrangement of let-
ters in words gives monotonically decreasing weight to
the vowels and consonants as one moves from right to
left in the word. This procedure does not capture the
intuition that the vowel in the syllable bearing primary
stress and the vowels following this syllable are more
significant determiners of rhyme than are the conso-
nants. For example, we feel that as a rhyme for
urgency, fervency would be better than agency. A reverse
dictionary, however, would choose the latter. More
specifically, even if the difficulties associated with spell-
ing differences were overcome, a reverse dictionary
would still accord more weight to the /g/ consonant
sound of agency than to the /ar/ vowel sound of
fervency, contrary to our intuitions.
As already indicated, our procedure uses word pronun-
ciations rather than spellings as the basis for the rhyme
dimension. A total of more than 120,000 pronuncia-
tions from Webster&apos;s Seventh Collegiate Dictionary
have been submitted to the encoding process. The first
step in encoding replaces the symbols in the pronuncia-
tion representations with single-byte codes representing
phonetic segments. The procedure which maps seg-
ments to byte codes also allows different segments to
be mapped into a single code, in effect defining equiv-
alence classes of segments. For example, the French u
sound in brut is mapped onto the same segment as the
English long u sound in boot. This is the same mapping
that most English speakers would make.
In the mapping currently in use, all vowels are organized
linearly according to the vowel triangle. At one end of
the spectrum is the long e sound in beet (/i/). At the
other end is the long u sound in boot (/u/).
a
pot
The diphthongs are organized into two subseries, one for
rising diphthongs and the other for falling ones. As with
the vowels, each subseries is a linear arrangement of the
diphthongs according to the position of the initial sound
on the vowel triangle. The consonants are similarly or-
ganized into several subseries. There are voiced and
voiceless stops, voiced and voiceless fricatives and
affricates, nasals, and liquids.
An important point about this mapping from pronun-
ciation patterns to phonetic segments is that it is flexible.
Both the phonetic equivalence classes and the collating
sequence can be easily changed. The system can thus
serve as the basis for experimentation aimed at finding
the precise set of phonetic encodings that yield the most
convincing set of rhymes.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998558">
The second encoding step arranges the segments for a
pronunciation in the order representing their importance
for determining rhyme. This ordering is also the subject
of continuing experimentation. The current arrange-
ment is as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987276666666667">
(1) All segments preceding the syllable bearing pri-
mary stress are recorded in the order that they occur
in the pronunciation string.
(2) All consonantal segments in and following the
syllable bearing primary stress are added to the en-
coding in the order in which they occur.
(3) All vocalic segments (vowels and diphthongs) in
and following the syllable bearing primary stress are
placed before any segments for trailing consonants
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993185131578947">
in the final syllable. If there are no trailing conso-
nants in the final syllable, then these vocalic seg-
ments are placed at the end of the encoding.
Note that this scheme preserves the order of the seg-
ments preceding the point of primary stress, as well as
those in the final syllable. For words where primary
stress occurs before the final syllable, the vowels are
raised in importance ( with respect to rhyming) over all
consonants except final ones. This procedure allows us
to capture the intuition that fervency is a better rhyme
for urgency than agency.
The final step in the encoding procedure reverses the
phonetic segment strings right-for-left, groups them ac-
cording to the position of the syllable bearing primary
stress (i.e., the distance of that syllable from the end of
the word) and sorts the groups just as in the production
of reverse dictionaries. The difference is that now
neighbors in the resulting sorted list have a better chance
of rhyming because of the use of pronunciations and the
application of our intuitions about rhymes.
We note that the resulting lists of rhymes are not perfect.
This is so first because we have not completed the ex-
periments which will result in an &amp;quot;optimal&amp;quot; set of int-
uitions about the encoding process. One planned
experiment will clarify the position of the schwa vowel
in the vowel triangle. Another will study intervocalic
consonant clusters which, especially when they contain
nasals or liquids, result in less successful rhymes. A third
study will allow us to identify &amp;quot;discontinuity&amp;quot; in the
rhyme list, across which rhyming words are very unlikely
to be found. In Figure 1., a discontinuity seems to occur
between currency and trustworthy.
The second reason that our rhyme lists are not perfect
is that it is unlikely that any single dimension will be
sufficient to guarantee that all and only good rhymes for
a given word will appear adjacent to that word in the
dimension&apos;s order, if only because different people disa-
gree on what constitutes &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; rhyme.

We give two sequences of words selected from the
WordSmith RHYME dimension.
antiphonary

missionary
These five words have their primary stress in the forth
syllable from the right, and they also have the same four
vowel sounds from that point onwards. Notice that the
spelling of antiphonary would place it quite far from the
others in a standard reverse dictionary. In addition, the
extra syllables at the beginning of antiphonary,
seditionary, and expeditionary are irrelevant for deter-
mining rhyme.

These four words, each a homonym of the others, share
a single record in the rhyming index and are therefore

entations which, in turn, are converted into articulatory
movements. Psycholinguists have generally assumed
(Forster and Chambers, 1973) that the mapping from
letters to phonemes is mediated by two processes, one
based on rules and the other based on retrieval of stored
pronunciations. For example, the rule ea -&gt; /i/ con-
verts the ea into the long e sound of leaf. The other
process, looking up the stored pronunciation of a word,
is responsible for the reader&apos;s rendering of deaf as /def/,
despite the existence of the ea -&gt; /i/ rule. Both proc-
esses are believed to operate in the pronunciation of
known words (Rosson, 1985).
Until recently, it was generally assumed that novel
words or pseudowords (letter strings which are not real
words of English but which conform to English spelling
patterns, e.g., heal) are pronounced solely by means of
the rule process because such strings do not have stored
representations in the mental lexicon. However,
Glushko (1979) has demonstrated that the pronuncia-
tion of a pseudoword is influenced by the existence of
lexical &amp;quot;neighbors.&amp;quot; i.e., real words that strongly resem-
ble the pseudoword. Pseudoworcis such as heaf, whose
closest neighbors (leaf and deaf) have quite different
pronunciations, take longer to read than pseudowords
such as hean, all of whose close neighbors have similar
pronunciations (dean, lean, mean, etc.). (It has been
assumed that words which differ only in initial conso-
nants are &amp;quot;closer&amp;quot; neighbors than those which differ in
other segments.) Glushko has also demonstrated an ef-
fect of lexical neighbors on the pronunciation of familiar
words of English.
The picture that emerges from this psychological work
depicts the retrieval process as selecting all stored words
which are similar to a given input. If the input is not
found in this set (i.e., the input is a novel word or
pseudoword), its pronunciation is generated by analogy
from the pronunciations that are found. Analogical
processing must take note of the substring common to
the input and its neighbors (ean in the case of hean), use
only this part of the pronunciation, and make provision
for pronouncing the substring which is different (h).
When the pronunciations of the lexical neighbors are
consistent, the pronunciation of the pseudoword can be
generated by the reader more quickly than when the
pronunciations are inconsistent.
There are of course many unanswered questions about
how readers actually generate pronunciations by anal-
ogy. One approach to answering the questions is to
build a computational system that can use various strat-
egies for finding lexical neighbors, combining partial
pronunciations, etc., and then compare the output of the
system to the pronunciations produced by human read-
ers. The following is an outline of such a computational
system.
Two WordSmith files will be used to support a proposed
program that generates pronunciations for unknown
words based on stored pronunciations of known words.
The first is a main file which is keyed on the spelling of
words and which contains pronunciations organized ac-
cording to part of speech. This is the file which sup-
ported the PRONUNC and RHYME WordSmith
functions described earlier. In this file, each pronuncia-
tion of a word has stored with it a mapping from its
phonetic segments onto the letters of the spelling of the
word. These mappings were generated by a PROLOG
program that uses 148 spelling-to-pronunciation rules
for English (e.g.. ph -&gt; /f/). The second file is an index
to the main file keyed on reverse spelling. This file is
equivalent to the one which supports the REVERSE
WordSmith dimension shown in Figure 1.
The strategy for generating a pronunciation for an un-
known word is to find its lexical neighbors and produce
a pronunciation &amp;quot;by analogy&amp;quot; to their pronunciations.
The procedure is as follows: (a) Segment the spelling of
the unknown word into substrings. (b) Match each sub-
string to part of the spelling of a known word (or
words). (c) Consult the spelling-to-pronunciation map
to find the pronunciation of the substring. (d) Combine
the pronunciations of the substrings into a pronunciation
for the unknown word.
These steps are illustrated below for the unknown word

bran is the longest initial substring in brange

and 20 other words begin with this string.

ary. The match is to the word range. In the

From the substring matches, the pronunciations
of /b/, /r/, /n/, /g/, and /e/ are obtained in
a straightforward manner, but pronunciation of
the vowel a is not the same in the bran and ange
substrings. Thus, two different pronunciations
emerge as the most likely renderings of brange.

Here, pronunciation by analogy yields two
conflicting outcomes depending upon the word
model selected as the lexical neighbor. If peo-
ple use similar analogical strategies in reading,
then we might expect comparable disagree-
ments in pronunciation when they are asked to
read unfamiliar words. A very informal survey
we conducted suggests that there is consider-
able disagreement over the pronunciation of
brange. About half of those we asked preferred
pronunciation (i), while the others chose (ii).
In the example shown above, segmentation is driven by
the matching process, i.e. the substrings chosen are the
longest which can be matched in the main file and the
reverse spelling file. There are, of course, other possible
strategies of segmentation, including division at syllable
boundaries and division based on the onset-rhyme
structure within the syllable (for brange, br + ange).
Evaluation of these alternative methods must await fur-
ther experimentation.
There are other outstanding questions related to the
Matching and Combining steps. If matches cannot be
found for initial and final substrings that overlap (as in
the example) or at least abut, then information about the
pronunciation of an internal substring will be missing.
Finding a match for an internal substring requires either
a massive indexing of the dictionary by letter position, a
time consuming search of the standard indexes, or the
development of a clever algorithm. With regard to
combining substring pronunciations, the problem of pri-
mary stress assignment arises when primary stress is ab-
sent from all of the substrings or is present at different
locations in two or more of them. Finally, there is a
question of the weight that should be assigned to alter-
native pronunciations generated by this procedure.
Should a match to a high frequency word be preferred
over a match to a low frequency word? Is word fre-
quency more important than the number of matching
substrings which have the same pronunciation? These
are empirical psycholinguistic questions, and the an-
swers will no doubt help us generate pronunciations that
more closely mirror those of native English speakers.

The other process, looking up the stored pronunciation of a word, is responsible for the reader&apos;s rendering of deaf as /def/, despite the existence of the ea -&gt; /i/ rule. Both processes are believed to operate in the pronunciation of known words (Rosson, 1985). Until recently, it was generally assumed that novel words or pseudowords (letter strings which are not real words of English but which conform to English spelling patterns, e.g., heal) are pronounced solely by means of the rule process because such strings do not have stored representations in the mental lexicon. However, Glushko (1979) has demonstrated that the pronunciation of a pseudoword is influenced by the existence of lexical &amp;quot;neighbors.&amp;quot; i.e., real words that strongly resemble the pseudoword. Pseudoworcis such as heaf, whose closest neighbors (leaf and deaf) have quite different pronunciations, take longer to read than pseudowords such as hean, all of whose close neighbors have similar pronunciations (dean, lean, mean, etc.). (It has been assumed that words which differ only in initial consonants are &amp;quot;closer&amp;quot; neighbors than those which differ in other segments.) Glushko has also demonstrated an effect of lexical neig</context>

Psycholinguists have generally assumed (Forster and Chambers, 1973) that the mapping from letters to phonemes is mediated by two processes, one based on rules and the other based on retrieval of stored pronunciations. For example, the rule ea -&gt; /i/ converts the ea into the long e sound of leaf. The other process, looking up the stored pronunciation of a word, is responsible for the reader&apos;s rendering of deaf as /def/, despite the existence of the ea -&gt; /i/ rule. Both processes are believed to operate in the pronunciation of known words (Rosson, 1985).

Section 3 outlines a program for generating a pronunciation of an unknown word based on pronunciations of known words. There is evidence (Rosson. 1985) that readers sometimes generate a pronunciation for an unfamiliar letter string based on analogy to stored lexical &amp;quot;neighbors&amp;quot; of the string, i.e. actual words that differ only slightly in spelling from the unfamiliar string. A program which generates pronunciations by analogy might serve as a supplement to programs that use spelling-to-sound rules in applications such as speech synthesis (Thomas, et al., 1984), or it might be used to find rhyming words, in WordSmith&apos;s rhyming dimension, for an unknown word. 2. Rhyme The WordSmith rhyme dimension is based on two files. The first is a main file keyed on the spelling of words arranged in alphabetical order and containing the words&apos; pronunciations organized according to part of speech. This same file serves as the data base for the PRONUNC application and dimension shown in Figure 1. The second file is an index to the first. It is keyed on encoded pronunciations and contains pointers to words in the main file that have the indicated pronunciations. If </context>

If a single pronunciation corresponds to multiple spellings in the main file, then there will be multiple pointers, one for each spelling. Thus, this index file also serves as a list of homophones. The order of the encoded pronunciations in the index file defines the rhyming dimension so that words which are close to one another in this file are more likely to rhyme than words which are far apart. The original motivation for the encoding used to obtain the rhyme dimension comes from published reverse dictionaries, some of which (e.g., Walker, 1924) even call themselves &amp;quot;rhyming dictionaries&amp;quot;. Such reverse dictionaries are obtained from a word list by (a) writing the words right-to-left, instead of left-to-right. (b) doing a normal alphabetic sort on the reversed spellings, and (c) restoring the original left-to-right orientation of the words in the resulting sorted list. This procedure was used to derive the REVERSE dimension shown in Figure 1. There are several problems with using reverse dictionaries as the basis for determining rhymes. First, since English spelling allows multiple ways of writing the same sounds, words that in fact d</context>
