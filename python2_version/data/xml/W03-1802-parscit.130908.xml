<bodyText confidence="0.999896142857143">
Term extraction systems are now an integral part
of the compiling of specialized dictionaries and up-
dating of term banks. Several tools exist either for
extracting or structuring terminology (see (Cabr´e
et al., 2001) for a review of the current systems).
Systems for identifying conceptual relationships are
generally based on external evidence: (Cort`es and
Cabr´e, 2002) define a catalogue of linguistic mark-
ers to detect conceptual relationship such as simi-
larity or inclusion relationships. Similarity is de-
tected by the prototype linguistic expression: to be
similar to. Other systems relies on internal evi-
dence. (Morin and Jacquemin, 1999; Hamon and
Nazarenko, 2001) structure complex terms (multi-
word terms) with the help of lexical databases or
general dictionaries. The relationships handled are
limited to synonymy and hyperonymy. (Grabar and
Zweigenbaum, 2000) identify morphological fami-
lies of word forms applied on a medical thesaurus
with a precision of 92 % such as (arthrite “arthri-
tis”, arthrose “arthrosis”, arthropathie “arthropa-
thy”, ). They also make deductions on their con-
ceptual relationship with other lexical units and their
contribution to the overall knowledge organization
of a specialized field, namely medicine. The con-
ceptual relationships identified are synonymy, refer-
ence and hyperonymy.
In this paper, we present a term detection approach
that discovers, structures, and infers conceptual rela-
tionships between terms for French. Conceptual re-
lationships are deduced from specific types of term
variations, morphological and syntagmatic, and are
expressed in terms of lexical functions (Wanner,
1996). Term variations have already proved their re-
liability in information retrieval: (Jacquemin, 2001)
considers different types of terminological variants
including syntactic variations to perform accurate
text indexing. In the remaining sections, we present
some conceptual systems, provide a linguistic typol-
ogy of term variations and describe the two steps of
our approach. In the final part, we give results and
briefly discuss them.

Terms are generally classified using partitive and
generic relationships to be presented in a thesaural
structure. But other relationships exist, the so-called
complex relationships (Sager, 1990, pages 34-35)
which are domain and application dependent. Ex-
amples of such complex relationships are:

<bodyText confidence="0.972370714285714">
Studying term formation, (Kageura, 2002) intro-
duces intra-term relationships dealing with complex
terms and defining the role of the determinant with
respect to the head noun. In computer program, pro-
gram is the head noun and computer the determi-
nant. As program is intended for computer, a “des-
tination” intra-relationship occurs between program
and computer. (L’Homme, 2002) used lexical func-
tions to represent various types of relationships via
an unique formalism for a computerized version of a
dictionary. These relationships are of several types:
paradigmatic such as the generic (Gener) or
antonymy (Anti) relationships:
Gener(retail sale) = sale,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.599761285714286">
Anti(retail sale) = wholesaling;
derivational such as nominalizations (S , V ):
S (to program) =programmer,
V (to program) =programming;
syntagmatic (Bon, Real ):
Bon(software) =performing,
Real (programme) = to run [DET ].
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99692825">
These conceptual relationships are assigned manu-
ally to terms or sets of terms. We propose to au-
tomatically assign conceptual relationships to com-
plex terms through their variations.

3 Concept identification through Term
variations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999729">
For complex terms identification, it is necessary
to first define syntactic structures which are poten-
tially lexicalisable. These complex sequences are
so-called “base-terms”.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999891">
3.1 Base terms and their linguistic Variations
</subsectionHeader>
<footnote confidence="0.759285111111111">
For French, the syntactic structures or patterns of
base-terms are:
Noun1 Adj emballage biod´egradable (biodegrad-
able package)
Noun1 (Prep (Det)) Noun2 ions calcium (calcium
ion) prot´eine de poissons (fish protein), chimio-
prophylaxie au rifampine (rifampicin chemo-
prophylaxis)
Noun1 a` Vinf viandes a` griller (grill meat)
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.977984322580645">
These base structures are not frozen structures and
accept variations. Terminological variation in texts
is now a well-known phenomenon estimated from
15 % to 35 %, depending on the domain reflecting by
the texts and the different kinds of variants handled.
For acquisition, it is essential to identify extensively
all the concepts represented by terms in textual data.
Thus, only term variants which can preserve the
base-term semantics and thus refer to the same con-
cept are taken into account in a first step. Two se-
quences such as histamine pr´esente dans le vin (his-
tamine which is present in wine) et histamine du vin
(histamine of the wine) refer to the same term his-
tamine du vin (wine histamine); but, the sequences
produit a` surgeler (product to be frozen) and pro-
duit surgel´e (frozen product) refer to two different
terms linked by an aspectual relationship.
We present now a linguistic typology of base-term
variations for French:
Graphical case differences and presence of a op-
tional hyphen inside the Noun1 Noun2 structure.
Inflexional orthographic variants gathering to-
gether inflexional variants that are predictable such
as conservations de produit (product preservations)
or unpredictable such as conservation de produits
(product preservation).
Shallow syntactic The shallow syntactic varia-
tions modify the function words of the base-terms.
There are three kinds of internal syntactic variations:
is-1 variations of the preposition: chromatographie
en colonne (column chromatography) chro-
matographie sur colonne (chromatography on
column);
is-2 optional character of the preposition and of the
article: fixation azote (nitrogen fixation) fix-
ation d’azote (fixation of nitrogen) fixation
de l’azote (fixation of the nitrogen);
is-3 predicative variants: the predicative role of the
adjective: pectine m´ethyl´ee (methylate pectin)
ces pectines sont m´ethyl´ees (these pectins
are methylated).
Syntactic The shallow syntactic variations modify
the internal structure of the base-terms:
S-1 Internal modification variants: insertion inside
the base-term structure of
a modifier such as the adjective inside the
Noun1 Prep Noun2 structure: lait de bre-
bis (goat’s milk), lait cru de brebis (milk
straight from the goat);
a nominal specifier inside the Noun Adj.
These specifiers belongs to a closed list
of nouns such as type, origine, couleur
(colour): prot´eine v´eg´etale “vegetable
protein” prot´eine d’origine v´eg´etale
“protein of vegetable origin”.
S-2 Coordinational variants: head or expansion co-
ordination of base term structures and enumer-
ation:
analyse de particules “particule analysis”
analyse et le tri de particules “particle sort and
analysis”
alimentation humaine “human feeding” ali-
mentation animale et humaine “human and an-
imal feeding”.
Morphosyntactic The Morphosyntactic varia-
tions modify the internal structure of the base-terms
and its components are liable to morphological
modification (including derivation).
M-1 Morphology : the preposition inside a can-
didate term of Noun1 Prep Noun2 structure
is equivalent to a prefix applying on Noun2:
pourrissement apr`es r´ecolte (rot after harvest)
pourrissement post-r´ecolte (post-harvesting
rot);
M-2 Derivational morphology: a derivational vari-
ation that keeps the synonymy of the base
term implies a relational adjective: acidit´e du
sang (acidity of the blood) acidit´e sanguine
(blood acidity). This morphosyntactic variation
could be associated with a syntactic variation:
the sequence: alimentation destin´ee a` l’homme
et a` l’animal “food destined to man and to ani-
mal” is a variation of the base-term: alimenta-
tion animale “animal food”.
Two other types of variation could have been in-
cluded in this typology: paradigmatic and anaphori-
cal variations. The first one relies on the substitution
principle of distributional linguistics (Harris, 1968).
One or two words of the base-term could be sub-
stituted by one of their synonyms without modify-
ing the syntactic structure (Hamon and Nazarenko,
2001). The second one gathers elliptical anaphora
and acronyms.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977603">
3.2 Variations reflecting conceptual
relationships
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996394960317461">
All these variations are those which could preserve
synonymy with the base term. They can, of course,
include semantic discrepancies and can refer either
to two base terms or to a base term and a con-
ceptually linked term. Thus, two different prepo-
sitions lead to two base terms: transmission par
satellite (satellite transmission) transmission en-
tre satellites (transmission between satellites) and
internal modification (see variation S-1a) refers to
a overcomposed term: huile essentielle de sapin (fir
essence) is a hyponym of huile essentielle (essence)
and not a variation of huile de sapin (fir oil).
We propose to identify the conceptual relation-
ships betwen base terms through syntactic or mor-
phological clues. We use standard lexical functions
to express the conceptual relationships. When there
does not exist a lexical function to label a conceptual
relationship, we introduce a new lexical function (i.e
a non standard one). Standard lexical function are
written in lower-case, non-standard in upper-case.
Syntactic The internal modification of the base
structures mainly implies two types of semantic re-
lationships:
Hyperonymy: if it is a relational adjective
that modifies the base term of N1 Adj or
N1 Prep (Det) N2 structure, an hyperonymic
relationship occurs between the base term
and the modified one. The lexical function
that captures hyperonymic relationships is the
function Spec introduced by (Grimes, 1990):
Spec (contraction isom´etrique “isomet-
ric contraction”) = contraction musculaire
isom´etrique “isometric muscular contraction”
Spec (agent bact´erien “bacterial agent”) =
agent infectieux bact´erien “bacterial infectious
agent”
Antonymy: if it is an adverb of negation that
modifies the base term of N1 Adj structure,
an antonymic relationship occurs between the
base term and the modified one. This relation-
ship of opposition is described with the func-
tion Anti:
Anti(levure floculante “flocculating yeast”)=
levure non floculante “non-flocculating yeast”
Morphosyntactic Semantic distinctions appear
with base terms that are morphologically related to
other base terms. Two base-terms and
are considered as morphologically-related if one of
the three following constraints are satisfied:
i. and are head nouns and are identical.
and are expansions and are semantically
related by the use of an affix;
ii. and are head nouns and are semantically
related by the use of an affix. and are
expansions and are identical;
iii. and are head nouns, and are ex-
pansions, either and are identical and
and are semantically related by the use of
a suffix such as preserved food/food preserva-
tion;
Some affixes that have been studied for French
by (Corbin, 1987) provide clues to character-
ize the semantic link occurring between two
morphologically-related candidate terms.
Antonymy: the prefixes ir, d´e, non(-) applying
either on the head or expansion element on a
base term whatever is its structure characterize
an antonymic relationship. Examples are:
Anti (solubilisation micellaire “micellar
solubilization”) = insolubilisation micellaire
“micellar insolubilisation”
Anti (ph´enol polym´eris´e “polymerized phe-
nol”) = ph´enol non-polym´eris´e “unpolymerized
phenol”
Set of: the suffixes age, ade applying on the
head noun of base term attest of a “set of” rela-
tionship expressed with the function Mult:
Mult (plume de canard “duck feather”) =
plumage de canards “duck feather” The two
base-terms share the same pattern.
Result: A “result” relationship is expressed
with the function N applying on nouns. This
relation is induced either by:
– the suffixes age, ade, erie applying on the
head noun of base terms:
N (plumage de canards “duck feather”)
=plume de canard “duck feather”
N (filetage du saumon “salmon fillet-
ing”) = filet de saumon “salmon fillet”;
The two base-terms share the same pat-
tern.
– or by the suffixes age, ade, erie, ment,
tion, ure associated with an inversion. We
distinguish two cases:
if this morphological link involves a
N Adj structure, the function N ap-
plies:
N (conservation des aliments “food
preservation”) = aliment conserv´e
“preserved food”;
if the morphological link involves a
N a` Vinf structure, we face a non-
standard function where the term of N
a` Vinf structure expresses the state be-
fore the process. Thus, we introduce
the new function N :
N (conservation des aliments “food
preservation”) = aliment a` conserver
“food to preserve”;
Actor: the suffixe eur applying on the head
noun of a base term builds its actant expressed
with the function S : S (transport routier
“road transport” = transporteur routier “road
haulier”. The two base-terms share the same
pattern.
Other semantic relationships involving two base-
terms with the same pattern are induced by prefixes.
For those, we have to introduce new functions as:
“again” relationship with the prefixes re, r´e:
AGAIN(est´erification enzymatique “enzymatic
esterification”) = r´eest´erification enzymatique
“enzymatic reesterification”;
“before” relationship with the prefixe pr´e(-):
BEFORE(traitement enzymatique “enzymatic
treatment”) = pr´etraitement enzymatique “en-
zymatic pretreatment”.

The term extractor program takes as input a tagged
and lemmatized corpus. The programme imple-
ments shallow parsing and morphological conflat-
ing. First, it scans the corpus, counts and extracts
strings whose syntax characterizes base-terms or
one of their variants. This collecting step uses lo-
cal grammars based on regular expressions (Abney,
1997). These grammars use the morphosyntactic
information associated with the words of the cor-
pus by the tagger. The different occurrences re-
ferring to a base term or one of its variants are
grouped as a pair formed by lemmas of the can-
didate base term. Second, morphological analysis
is performed to confluate synomymic derivational
variants of base terms such as acidit´e du sang (acid-
ity of the blood) acidit´e sanguine (blood acid-
ity). Stripping-recoding morphological rules adopt
the following rule schemata:
where:
S is the relational suffix to be deleted from the end
of an adjective. The result of this deletion is the
stem R;
M is the mutative segment to be concatenated to R
in order to form a noun.
For example, the rule [ -´e +e ] says that if there is
an adjective which ends with ´e, we should strip this
ending from it and append the string e to the stem.
The algorithm below resumes the successive steps
for identifying relational adjectives:

<listItem confidence="0.966595444444445">
1. Examine each candidate of Noun Adj structure;
2. Apply a transformational rule in order to gener-

3. Search the set of candidate terms for a
pair formed with Noun1 (identical between a
Noun1 (Prep (Det)) Noun2 and a Noun1 Adj
structures) and Noun2 generated from step 2.
4. If step 3 succeeds, group the two base struc-
tures under an unique candidate term.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993744">
In Step 2, morphological rules generate one or sev-
eral nouns for a given adjective. We generate a noun
for each relational suffix class. A class of suffixes in-
cludes the allomorphic variants. This overgeneration
method used in information retrieval by (Jacquemin,
2001) gives low noise because the base noun must
not only be an attested form in the corpus, but must
also appear as an extension of a head noun.
At the end of the linguistic processing, the term
extractor proposes as output:

In the previous step, a first list of relational ad-
jectives has been established thanks to their para-
phrasic property. (Daille, 2001) demonstrated that
candidate terms of N Adj structure where Adj is re-
lational hold a more important naming potential than
for the synonym form in N1 Prep N2. The absence
of paraphrases, the non-paraphrasability, or a com-
plex paraphrasability or a large derivational distance
between the adjective and the noun do not allow ex-
haustive identification. We extend this list by ex-
ploiting the coordination variations of N Adj base
terms. Indeed, a relational adjective holds the prop-
erty to coordinate only with other relational adjec-
tives. To summarise:

This classic learning algorithm that is normally
bound by the number of adjectives in the corpus con-
verges in five steps. It allows to extend the set of re-
lational adjectives from 143 to 239. The following

Using this extended list of relational adjectives,
we automatically check all the modification variants
of collected base-terms:
if a relational adjective is present, we infer
an hyperonymy link between the variant and
the base term as for contraction isom´etrique

culaire isom´etrique “isometric muscular con-
traction”, but not for organisation ordonn´ee
des mol´ecules “ordered molecule organization”
that remains a syntactic variation of organisa-
tion mol´eculaire “molecule organization”;
if an adverb of negation is present, we infer an
antonymy link between the variant and the base

<bodyText confidence="0.9999315">
Links between complex terms can be used to as-
sist terminolographers to handle extracted termino-
logical data more conveniently, since several related
concepts are clustered. This conceptual structuring
relies on term variation and we have stressed the cru-
cial part of this handling. The method can be eas-
ily adapted to other romance languages and English
for which it suffices to define patterns for base-terms
and their variations and to list appropriate affixes re-
flecting semantic relationships.

In this paper, we present a term detection approach that discovers, structures, and infers conceptual relationships between terms for French. Conceptual relationships are deduced from specific types of term variations, morphological and syntagmatic, and are expressed through lexical functions.

The programme implements shallow parsing and morphological conflating. First, it scans the corpus, counts and extracts strings whose syntax characterizes base-terms or one of their variants. This collecting step uses local grammars based on regular expressions (Abney, 1997). These grammars use the morphosyntactic information associated with the words of the corpus by the tagger. The different occurrences referring to a base term or one of its variants are grouped as a pair formed by lemmas of the candidate base term. Second, morphological analysis is performed to confluate synomymic derivational variants of base terms such as acidit´e du sang (acidity of the blood) acidit´e sanguine (blood acidity). Stripping-recoding morphological rules adopt the following rule schemata: where: S is the relational suffix to be deleted from the end of an adjective. The result of</context>

(Daille, 2001) demonstrated that candidate terms of N Adj structure where Adj is relational hold a more important naming potential than for the synonym form in N1 Prep N2. The absence of paraphrases, the non-paraphrasability, or a complex paraphrasability or a large derivational distance between the adjective and the noun do not allow exhaustive identification. We extend this list by exploiting the coordination variations of N Adj base terms. Indeed, a relational adjective holds the property to coordinate only with other relational adjectives.
