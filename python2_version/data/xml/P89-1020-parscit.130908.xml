We present a general treatment of the com-
parative that is based on more basic linguistic
elements so that the underlying system can
be effectively utilized: in the syntactic analy-
sis phase, the comparative is treated the same
as similar structures; in the syntactic regular-
ization phase, the comparative is transformed
into a standard form so that subsequent pro-
cessing is basically unaffected by it. The scope
of quantifiers under the comparative is also in-
tegrated into the system in a general way.

Recently there has been interest in the devel-
opment of a general computational treatment
of the comparative. Last year at the Annual
ACL Meeting, two papers were presented on
the comparative by Ballard [1] and Rayner
and Banks [14]. Previous to that a compre-
hensive treatment of the comparative was in-
corporated into the syntactic analyzer of the
Linguistic String Project [15]; in addition the
DIALOGIC grammar utilized by TEAM [9]
also contains some coverage of the compara-
tive.

guage, and yet is a very difficult structure to
process by computer. Because it can occur in
a variety of forms pervasively throughout the
grammar, its incorporation into a NL system
is a major undertaking which can easily ren-
der the system unwieldy. We will describe an
approach to the computational treatment of
the comparative, which provides more general
coverage of the comparative than that of other
NLP Systems while not obscuring the underly-
ing system. This is accomplished by associat-
ing the comparative with simpler, more basic
linguistic entities so that it could be processed
by the system with only minor modifications.
The implementation of the comparative de-
scribed in this paper was done for the Pro-
teus Question Answering System (811 (referred
to hereafter as Proteus QAS), and should be
adaptable for other systems which have sim-
ilar modules. A more detailed discussion of
this work is given in [7].

The comparative is a difficult structure to pro-
cess for both syntactic and semantic reasons.
Syntactically the comparative is extraordinar-
ily diverse. The following sentences illustrate
a range of different types of comparative struc-
tures, some of which resemble other English
structures, as noted by Sager [15]. In the ex-
amples below, sentences with the comparative
that resemble other forms are followed by a

The problems in covering the syntax of the
comparative are therefore at least as complex
as the problems encountered for general coor-
dinate conjunctions, relative clauses, and cer-
tain subordinate and adverbial clauses. Incor-
porating conjunction-like comparatives into a
grammar is particularly difficult because that
structure can occur almost anywhere in the
grammar. Wh-relative-clause-like compara-
tives are complicated because they contain
an omitted noun where the omission can oc-
cur arbitrarily deep within the comparative
clause.
The comparative is difficult to process for
semantic reasons also because the comparative
marker can occur on different linguistic cate-
gories. Adjectives, quantifiers, and adverbs
can all take the comparative form, as in: he is
taller than John, he took more courses than
John, and he ran faster than John. There-

of the Comparative

<bodyText confidence="0.999875333333333">
In Section 1.1 it was shown that the com-
parative resembles other complex syntactic
structures. This observation suggests that
the comparative could be treated as general
coordinate conjunctions, wh-relative clauses,
and certain subordinate and adverbial clauses

by the syntactic analysis component of the
system. If the system can already handle
these structures, the extension for the compar-
ative is straightforward. This approach has
the advantage of utilizing the system&apos;s exist-
ing machinery to process comparative struc-
tures which are very complex and diverse;
in this way a minimal amount of effort re-
sults in extensive coverage. For example, to
cover conjunction-like comparative structures,
the production containing possible conjunc-
tions was modified to include than; to include
relative-clause-like comparatives, the produc-
tion containing words which can head rela-
tive clauses was also modified to include than.
Analogous minor grammar changes were made
for the other types of similar structures shown
above. Using this approach, a comprehen-
sive comparative extension was obtained by
a trivial modification of only a small number
of grammar productions.
Thus, a conjunction-like comparative struc-
ture such as Sentence la. in Section 1.1 would
be analyzed as consisting of an object which
contains a conjoined noun phrase more apples
CONJ 0 oranges where the value of CONJ
is than, and where a quantifier phrase similar
to more has been omitted which occurs with
oranges. A relative-clause type of compara-
tive structure such as Sentence 5a. would be
analyzed as a relative clause than we invited
0 adjoined to more guests. Those construc-
tions that are unique to the comparative, as
shown in Sehtences 8 through 11, have to be
uniquely defined. For example, the compara-
tive clause in Sentence 8 is defined as a clause
where the predicate is omitted, whereas the
comparative clause in Sentence 9 is defined as
a measure phrase.
Although the comparative syntactically re-
sembles other structures, this type of similar-
ity does not carry over to the underlying struc-
ture or to the semantics of the comparative,
as will be discussed shortly.
There are also some syntactic differences be-
tween the comparative and the structures it
resembles. For example, the comparative has
zeroing patterns that are somewhat different
from those associated with conjunctions:
+ John slept more than Mary [slept].
- John slept and Mary [slept].
The comparative constructions also have
scope marker constraints that are not appli-
cable to non-comparative structures. These
differences are handled by special add-on con-
straints that specifically deal with the com-
parative, and do not interfere with the other
restrictions.
The treatment of the comparative marker
is complicated because it can occur in a large
number of different locations in the head
clause2, as illustrated by a few examples be-
low:
He wanted to travel to more coun-
tries than he was able to.
He is taller than Mary.
He ate 3 more apples than Mary did.
He ate more in the fall than in the
winter.
Because the comparative marker can occur in
such a variety of locations and also be deeply
embedded in the head clause, it cannot be con-
veniently handled in the BNF component of
the grammar. Instead, the constraint com-
ponent deals with this problem by means of
special constraints that assign and pass up
the comparative marker; other constraints test
that the comparative clause is in the scope of
the marker.

4 Underlying Structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999609083333333">
Basically, linguists such as Chomsky [3,4],
Bresnan [2], Harris [10], and Pinkham [13]
agree on fundamental aspects concerning
the underlying structure of the comparative.
They regard its underlying structure as con-
sisting of two complete clauses where informa-
tion in the comparative clause which is iden-
tical to information in the head clause is re-
quired to be zeroed.
Harris&apos; work is particularly suitable for
computational purposes because he claims
that one underlying structure is the source of

all comparative forms. We modified his in-
terpretation somewhat to obtain a more con-
venient form for computation. In our ver-
sion, the underlying structure contains a main
clause where the comparison is the primary
relation; each quantity in the relation con-
tains an embedded clause specifying the quan-
tity being compared. An example of this
form is shown below for the sentence John
ate more apples than Mary, which resembles a
conjunction-like comparative structure where
the verb phrase has been omitted:
N1 [John ate N1 apples] &gt;
N2 [Mary ate N2 apples]
This form is also appropriate for all the
different comparative forms shown in Sec-
tion 1.1. For example, the underlying form
for a relative-clause-like comparative, such as
Sentence 5a. is:
N1 [N1 guests visited us] &gt;
N2 [we invited N2 guests]
The underlying form for a sentence such as a
man taller than John visited us is slightly dif-
ferent because the comparative structure it-
self is embedded in a noun phrase. The main
clause is a man visited us, and the compar-
ative structure is a clause adjoining a man,
whose underlying structure is:
N1 [the man is N1 tall] &gt;
N2 [John is N2 tall]
The notion that there is one underlying
form for all comparatives has important im-
plications for a computational treatment:

into one standard form consisting of a

ing compared.
• In the standard form, each clause of the

<bodyText confidence="0.993819892857143">
comparative operator is a simpler struc-
ture which can be processed using basi-
cally the usual procedures of the system.
This means that further processing does
not have to be modified for the compara-
tive.
This process can be illustrated by a simple ex-
ample. When the sentence more guests than
we invited visited us is regularized, a structure
consisting of an operator connecting two com-
plete clauses is obtained:
(&gt; (visited (er guests) (us))
(invited (we) (than guests)))
The symbols er and than, shown above,
roughly correspond to quantities being com-
pared, and in subsequent processing they are
each interpreted as denoting a certain type
of quantity. Notice that each clause of the
comparative is also in operator-operand form
where generally the verb of a sentence is con-
sidered the operator and the subject and ob-
ject (and sometimes sentence adjunct phrases)
are considered the operands3. Each of the two
clauses can be processed in the usual manner
provided that er and than are treated appro-
priately. This will be described further in Sec-
tion 5 which contains a discussion of semantics
and the comparative.
The regularization process was modified to
be a two phase process. The first phase uses
ordinary compositional translation rules to
perform the standard regularization so that
the surface analysis is transformed into a uni-
form operator-operand form. The composi-
tional regularization procedure is effective for
fairly basic sentence structures but not for
complex ones such as the comparative. The
compositional rules associated with compara-
tive structures only include labels categoriz-
ing the type of comparative structure. The
second phase, written specifically for the com-
parative, completes the regularization process
by filling in the missing elements, permuting
the structures to obtain the correct operator-
operand form, and supplying the appropriate
quantifiers er and than to the items being
comparativized. An example of this process
is shown for the relative-clause type of com-
parative in more guests than we invited visited
us, where the comparative clause than We in-
vited is analyzed syntactically as being a right
adjunct modifier of guests.
3However, if the predicate is an adjectival phrase,
the adjective is considered the operator and the verb
be the tense carrier. Thus, ignoring tense information,
the regularized form of John is tall is: (tall (John)).

Phase 2: (&gt; (visited (er guests) (us))

Another example is shown below for a
conjunction-like comparative, such as John
ate more apples than oranges:

(conj-than (more oranges)
(0 oranges)))
Phase 2: (&gt; (ate (John) (er apples)

There are a few key points that should
be made concerning the regularization proce-
dures. The Montague-style translation rules
could not readily be used to regularize the
comparative constructions as they were de-
fined in the context-free component. To use
the rules, the grammar would have to be mod-
ified substantially because the translation of
the comparative is different and more com-
plex than that of the structures it resembles.
In particular, it would then not be possible
to use the general conjunction mechanism to
obtain coverage of that type of comparative
structure. In the case of the usual relative
clause, the regularized form is also substan-
tially different from the regularized form of
the relative-clause type of comparative shown
above. For a typical relative clause, such as
that we invited ()in guests that we invited vis-
ited us, the regularized form occurs as a clause
embedded in the main clause as follows:
(visited (guests (invited (we) 0))
(us))
The second important point is that be-
cause of regularization further processing of
sentences containing a comparative is signifi-
cantly simplified and only minor changes are
required specifically for the comparative. In
Proteus QAS, as well as other NLP Sys-
tems, several other processing components are
needed after syntactic regularization until the
final result is obtained. Therefore a signifi-
cant result of our approach is that subsequent
components do not have to be modified for the
comparative. As long as the underlying sys-
tem can handle adjectives, degree expressions,
quantifiers, and adverbs, the remainder of the
processing of sentences with the comparative
is basically no different than the processing of
ordinary sentences because at that point the
comparative is represented as being composed
of fundamental linguistic entities.

5 Semantics of the Corn-
parative
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988970454545454">
Semantically the comparative denotes the
comparison of two quantities relative to a cer-
tain scale. This interpretation is consistent
with work in formal semantics ( [12,11], [6,5]),
although our formalism is not the same.
Since the comparative marker can occur
with adjectives, quantifiers, and adverbs, we
would like to integrate its semantic treat-
ment with the semantics of those fundamen-
tal linguistic categories and also remain true
to the semantics and syntax of the compara-
tive. This can be done by noting that once
the comparative is regularized, the compara-
tive marker becomes a higher order operator
connecting two clauses and what remains of
the marker within each clause functions as a
quantitative phrase. For example, the regu-
larized form for is John taller than Mary is:
(&gt; (tall (DEG er) (John))
(tall (DEG than) (Mary)))
In this form er and than are each interpreted
as a type of degree phrase that occurs with
adjectives. In a question answering applica-
tion such as that of Proteus QAS, each clause
of the above form is equivalent to the regu-
larized form of how tall is John, where how is
also interpreted as a degree phrase modifying
tali:
(tall (DEG how) (John))
The interpretation of a sentence containing
the comparative is therefore reduced to the
interpretation of two similar simpler clauses,
each containing an adjective operator and an
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997341">
165
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999671842105263">
operand which is a degree phrase. Issues con-
cerning the correct scale and criteria of com-
parison for adjectives are non-trivial, but are
generally not different from those issues con-
cerning adjectives not being comparativized.
For example, determining the scale and crite-
ria that should be used to interpret is John
more reliable than Jim raises similar issues to
those for how reliable is Jim.
The semantic treatment of adverbs gener-
ally parallels that of adjectives; the interpre-
tation of quantifiers in the comparative form
is also equivalent to the interpretation of cer-
tain interrogatives. For example, the regular-
ized form of did John take more courses than
Mary consists roughly of the two clauses John
took er courses and Mary took than courses,
which is treated analogously to how many in
how many courses did John take.

6 Quantifier Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.901549">
An interesting problem involving the compar-
ative concerns the scope of quantifiers when
there is a higher order sentential operator such
as the comparative. The problem is not dis-
cussed much in the literature, but was dis-
cussed by Rayner and Banks (14] when they
described their treatment of quantifiers for ev-
eryone spent more money in London than in
New York. The basic issue is whether the
quantifier every in everyone should be given
wider scope than the comparative itself, in
which case it is applicable to both clauses of
the comparative. Our approach addresses this
problem in a general way by adding a prelimi-
nary phase to the standard quantifier analysis.
Our approach has several key features:
• The replication of a quantified noun
phrase does not lead to impossible scop-
ing combinations, as frequently happens
when these phrases are replicated for the
purpose of obtaining a complete clause.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.952265571428571">
• Our approach is applicable to all gen-
eral higher order operators connecting
two clauses.
• The scope of quantifiers is determined in
a late stage of processing so that corn-
mittment is not done prematurely.
• A procedure using pragmatics and do-

<bodyText confidence="0.980988088888889">
main knowledge can easily be incorpo-
rated into the system as a separate com-
ponent to aid in scope determination.
In Proteus QAS, the scope of quantifiers is
determined subsequent to the regularization
and domain analysis components in a manner
similar to other NLP Systems, as described by
Woods (16]. The basic quantifier analysis pro-
cedure initially handled simple clauses, and
therefore had to be modified to accommodate
scope determination when a sentence contains
a higher order operator such as a compara-
tive or a coordinate conjunction. A prelim-
inary quantifier analysis phase was added to
find and label quantifiers which have a wider
scope than the comparative. In addition, mi-
nor modifications were made to the compo-
nent which translates the regularized form to
logical form, in order to handle the translation
of wider scope quantifiers.
Generally, in the case of the comparative,
the criteria used for determining whether or
not a quantifier should have a wider scope in-
volves the location of the quantifier relative to
the comparative marker in the surface form.
Usually, a preference is given to the wider
scope interpretation if the quantifier precedes
the marker. Using this approach, the sen-
tence everyone spent more money in London
than in New York is first interpreted syntac-
tically as consisting of two complete clauses,
which are roughly everyone spent er money
in London and everyone spent than money in
New York. The semantics of each clause is
interpreted the same as that of a simpler sen-
tence how much money did everyone spend in
London. The preliminary quantifier analysis
phase prefers the reading where the scope of
everyone is wider than the comparative opera-
tor because everyone precedes more. The sen-
tence is translated to logical form so that the
quantified expression VX : person(X) occurs
outside the comparative operator, and there-
fore has scope over both clauses of the com-
parative. The interpretation is roughly:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.3222216">

VX:person(X)(&gt;(spent (X) (er money)
(in London))
(spent (X) (than money)

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.997540666666667">
A different scope interpretation is obtained for
more students read than wrote a book, where
the two clauses are er students read a book
and than students wrote a book. The nar-
row scope interpretation of a in a book is ob-
tained because a follows more. In this case,
the quantified expressions for each clause of
the comparative are completely independent
of the other.

7 Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992316666667">
We have presented a method for incorporat-
ing general comparatives into a system with-
out unduly complicating the system. This is
done in the syntactic analysis component by
treating the comparatives the same as simi-
lar structures so that features of the syntac-
tic analyzer that already exist may be uti-
lized. The various comparative structures are
then regularized so that they are in a stan-
dard form consisting of a comparative opera-
tor and two complete clauses that contain a
quantity er or than which is interpreted by
the semantic component as a quantity such
as how, how many, or how much, as ap-
propriate. A preliminary quantifier analysis
component was added to determine whether
a sentence containing a higher order operator
has any quantifiers which have a wider scope
than the operator, and to label those that do.
The remainder of the processing is done as
usual except for minor modifications.
The treatment of the comparative that we
have presented is more extensive and general
than that of other NLP Systems to date, and
also is simple to implement. Only a small
number of productions of the BNF component
were changed to cover the comparative struc-
tures described in this paper. In addition,
three restrictions were modified for the com-
parative, and a set of separate add-on restric-
tions were included to handle comparative
zeroing patterns and scope marker require-
ments. Special regularization procedures were
written to regularize the different compara-
tive forms so that the standard Montague-
style compositional translation rules could be
used prior to the comparative regularization
phase.
Although we can process many forms of the
comparative, there is still substantial work
that remains which involves comparative sen-
tences where the comparative clause itself has
been omitted, as in New York banks are start-
ing to offer higher interest rates. In some
cases the comparison is between two different
time periods; in other cases the comparison
involves different types of like objects, such
as the interest rates of New York banks com-
pared to the interest rates of Florida banks.
The context can often be an aid in helping to
recover the missing information, but the re-
covery problem is still quite a challenge. Sen-
tences with this type of anaphora are very in-
teresting because they occur surprisingly reg-
ularly in language, and yet the recovery possi-
bilities are more limited and more controlled
than those occurring in discourse in general.
Possibly these type of sentences can provide us
with clues as to what elements are significant
for the recovery of the missing information.

This is accomplished by associating the comparative with simpler, more basic linguistic entities so that it could be processed by the system with only minor modifications. The implementation of the comparative described in this paper was done for the Proteus Question Answering System (811 (referred to hereafter as Proteus QAS), and should be adaptable for other systems which have similar modules. A more detailed discussion of this work is given in [7]. 1.1 The Problem The comparative is a difficult structure to process for both syntactic and semantic reasons. Syntactically the comparative is extraordinarily diverse. The following sentences illustrate a range of different types of comparative structures, some of which resemble other English structures, as noted by Sager [15].
