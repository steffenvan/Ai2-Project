In this paper we argue that current generation method-
ologies are inadequate for determining the high-level
structure characteristic of naturally-occurring extended
explanations. Our analysis of such explanations indi-
cates that high-level structure - composed of a unify-
ing framework and its associated basic blocks - must
be determined by bottom-up processes that attempt to
satisfy speaker, listener, and compositional goals, after
which top-down strategies can be used to organize the
material about the selected framework. In addition to a
description of this structure, this paper describes three
types of repetition whose use is dependent on this high-
level structure; their use not only contributes to the co-
hesiveness of extended explanations, but supports our
thesis of the non-recursive nature of the high-level struc-
ture. We conclude with an outline of our computational
strategy for generating this structure.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965709090909">
In this paper, we describe the high-level structure of
naturally-occurring, extended explanations and con-
tend that the organizational strategies currently em-
ployed for structuring short explanations are inade-
quate for generating this characteristic high-level struc-
ture. Our analysis suggests that text structure is not
completely recursive as others have claimed ([Grosz and
Sidner, 1986], [Reichman, 1978], [Polanyi, 19861, [Mann
and Thompson, 1988]), but rather that the high-level
structure of extended explanations is determined by
processes separate from those which organize text at
lower levels. Evidence for the non-recursive nature of
this structure is provided by repetition, which is fre-
quently used in extended explanations for a wide variety
of purposes. This device, whose use has been neglected
by current explanation research, exhibits a distinct re-
lationship to the structure of extended explanations,
implying that it, too, cannot be generated by recursive
strategies.
Our analysis is based on several sources, the primary
of which is the testimony before congressional com-
mittees regarding the Three Mile Island (TMI) acci-
dent ([Representatives, 1979], [Representatives, 19801).
These explanations were punctuated with numerous in-
terruptions and characteristically involved the opera-
tion of complex physical devices and extended causal
chains of events. The majority of these explanations
were planned beforehand and required many pages of
text - typically five, ten, or more, exclusive of interrup-
tions. Furthermore, the testimony comes from a variety
of sources: operators who were on the scene as the acci-
dent developed; engineers who gave post-accident eval-
uations; executives from the company that designed the
plant. This variety allowed examination of explanations
of the same set of events from many perspectives.
A secondary source was transcripts of a medical class
involved in patient diagnosis. While these transcripts
differed greatly form those of TMI - in particular, the
explanations provided were relatively short; they were
unplanned; and they were concerned with diagnostic
strategy as opposed to causal events - they exhibited
many of the characteristics found in the TMI explana-
tions.
The next section provides a brief overview of current
models for structuring text, followed by a description
of the basic block, the unit of discourse on which our
model of discourse is based. We then identify three
types of repetition whose use supports our contentions
of the non-recursive nature of basic block structure. We
conclude by describing the characteristics of high-level
structure of extended explanations, followed by a brief
description of our strategy for computationally gener-
ating this structure. A more detailed description of our
strategy and its role in a complete generational system
is contained in [Mooney, et al. 1989].

Given any large body of information to convey, there
are many possible combinations of that material, some
more cohesive than others. Frequently, deciding how to
organize a large body of material is more difficult than
determining what to include. Our research is concerned

COMPUTATIONAL MODELS Two gen-
eral methodologies have been applied to the structur-
ing of explanations: schemas ((McKeown, 19851, [Mc-
Coy, 19851, [Paris, 19871) and plans based on rhetori-
cal structure theory (RST) ([Hovy and McCoy, 19891,
[Hovy, 1988a], [Moore and Paris, 1988a], [Moore and
Swartout, 1988b]). Each methodology assumes that
text is hierarchically structured and that its operators
can be recursively expanded at any level within the dis-
course hierarchy. While these methods have proven
to be effective for organizing short pieces of text, we
maintain that they are inadequate for generating the
characteristic high-level structure of extended explana-
tions and certain forms of repetition. Rather, we main-
tain that this high-level structure can only be captured
by a separate, bottom-up process. Once this has been
completed, the integration of appropriate repetition can
proceed in conjunction with, but independently of, the
application of recursive strategies to the organization of
text at lower levels.
RHETORIC Rhetoric, the formal study of the art
of good writing, provides general strategies for orga-
nizing text at a high level that are absent from the
computational models. Analysis - &amp;quot;the method of ex-
planation whereby a subject is divided into its separate
component parts&amp;quot; - is possibly the most instrumental
of these strategies. There are no hard-and-fast rules
for determining what constitutes an appropriate anal-
ysis of a subject. As [Wicker and Albrecht, 1960] ob-
serves, a subject may be classified in as many ways as
it has characteristics/parts/stages/etc. However, there
are three criteria which experts ([Wicker and Albrecht,
1960], [Arena, 1975], [Thompson, 1957], [Daniel, 1967],
[Kane and Peters, 19661) mutually consider essential for
a satisfactory organizational strategy:

<listItem confidence="0.942358625">
1. The scheme should be logical; a single, consistent
criterion should be used for the analysis (e.g., time,
steps in a process).
2. The scheme should exhaust all of the possibilities;
everything to be conveyed should be encompassed by
the scheme.
3. The resultant categories should be mutually exclu-
sive; nothing should belong to more than one.

Now, what happened at Three Mile Island was that a
feedwater transient was experienced, and by that I mean,
simply, we lost feedwater to the plant momentarily.
Now, with loss of feedwater to the steam generator, the
plant will experience a momentary pressurization above its
normal pressure. This pressurization is released by a relief
valve located at the top of the pressurizer. It simply opens
and lets out a little bit of steam to take care of the excess
pressure that is &lt; interruption occurs here &gt;
Then at 15 seconds into the event-keeping in mind that
the valves opened maybe 5 seconds into the event-at 15 sec-
onds the pressure started coming down because the valve
had opened and cut off the pressure.
The valve should have reclosed when it got back down
to about 2,250 pounds; it did not reclose. The pressure pro-
ceeded to come on down. At about 30 seconds into the event,
this water here started disappearing, of course, because now
you are continuing to remove a very large amount of heat
here, which is then coming off as secondary side steam gen-
eration, and this water will proceed to disappear if you do
not start replacing it.
And the auxiliary feedwater which normally comes on to
make sure this does not go dry came on at about 30 seconds
into the event. And at least the pumps were running. So this
picture here is just the first 30 seconds and-or thereabouts.
And this figure here is indicative of the situation from 1
to 6 minutes into the event.

eration. In addition, these guidelines include no sugges-
tions for dealing with situations in which no logical, all-
inclusive framework can be identified, nor do they offer
suggestions for selecting among several organizational
schemes which meet the prescribed criteria equally well.
Furthermore, the guidelines are not sufficient in-and-of
themselves to account for all of the observed phenom-

BASIC BLOCKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966419">
Our model is based on a discourse unit which we have
termed a basic block. A basic block consists of two ele-
ments:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98241875">
1. an organizational focus, such as a person or location,
and
2. a set of propositions to be conveyed that are related
to that focus.2
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994700666666667">
The focus is what makes a cohesive unit of the material
in the block; it is the thread common to all of this
material, whether directly or indirectly.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.8031125">
2The term basic block is also used to refer to the segment
of text generated from these propositions.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.999057">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996785">
A basic block will be realized as a primary segment
of text which occupies the first level of the discourse
hierarchy. In a coherent discourse, the foci on which
the basic blocks are based are themselves related, each
representing a different aspect of some unifying frame-
work. This framework is analogous to the organiza-
tional scheme of rhetorical analysis.
The testimony from which the basic block in Fig-
ure 1 was extracted&apos; illustrates these points. This block
references a particular time frame: zero to thirty sec-
onds of the accident at TMI. The remaining blocks of
that testimony (not shown) are similarly constructed
around time frames, e.g., one to six minutes, six min-
utes to one hour, etc. Observed frameworks demon-
strate a gamut of types: properties of the concepts (lo-
cation, time), planning strategies in which events are
involved (medical diagnosis), and characteristics that
are not only inherent in the material but also due in
part to the speaker&apos;s perception of them (significant
factors). There appears to be no limit to what can con-
stitute an acceptable framework, only that it is derived
from the material itself and not from an independent
device solely concerned with text structure. What may
be a potential framework for one set of material may be
totally inadequate for another. Note that these features
are reflective of the guidelines suggested by analysis.
In addition to forming a cohesive unit, basic block
structure is explicitly distinguished in the following two
ways. First, it is often explicitly marked. In Figure 1,
the speaker closes the block with explicit reference to
its focus: &amp;quot;So this picture here is just the first 30 sec-
onds and-or thereabouts.&amp;quot; The subsequent block in this
testimony is also well marked, this time by its initial
sentence (which is the last sentence of the figure): &amp;quot;And
this figure here is indicative of the situation from I to
6 minutes.&amp;quot; While the explicit marking of basic blocks
in discourse provides persuasive evidence for their dis-
tinctive role in the discourse hierarchy, even stronger
testimony is supplied by the manner in which certain
forms of repetition are used.

Our analysis of naturally-occurring extended explana-

of the text. The final summary serves several purposes:

<listItem confidence="0.9964788">
• It is a means of emphasizing material that an author
finds most important.
• It is a vehicle for including information that does not
fit within the framework of the main body of text.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999867888888889">
In the final summaries which we have examined, there
is a strong correlation between the points included in
the summary and the basic block structure of the text.
Although a final summary is not constrained to address
each basic block, there is usually a one-to-one relation
between the foci of the blocks and the items stressed in
a summary. These features are demonstrated by the
rather extensive final summary contained in the ap-
pendix 5 .

TRANSITION SUMMARIES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948125">
Unlike the situation for final summaries, both the
conditions calling for the use of a transition summary
and the determination of its contents are relatively
clear-cut. Transition summaries are similar to final
summaries in that they summarize important informa-
tion, but the similarities end there. While final sum-
maries are used to conclude a discourse, transition sum-
maries are used to signal a shift in circumstances that

cussed, the extended questioning preventing him from con-

are not implicated by the preceding material and for
which the listener is probably unprepared; where a fi-
nal summary stresses the major points of a complete
discourse, a transition summary emphasizes that ma-
terial instrumental to a listener&apos;s understanding of this
change in direction and consequently prevents poten-
tial confusion. Transition summaries consist of a sum-
mary of the material which implicates an expected, but
unrealized, continuance of the discourse. Additionally,
reference to the material which is responsible for pre-
venting this expected outcome and an indication that
everything is not as it seems may also be included. Note
that this information, unlike that in a final summary,
may play a very minor role in the overall text. Transi-
tion summaries also exhibit a relation to basic blocks.
While final summaries are found only at the end of a
text, transition summaries have only been observed at
the end of blocks within the body of the text.
Figure 2 provides a typical example of a transition
summary. Lines 3 and 6 describe the facts, presented
in the testimony preceding this summary, that imply
to the operator that everything is under control; lines
2 and 6 summarize this condition. However, the facts
contained in lines 4 and 5 (also presented in the earlier
testimony), indicate that all is not as well as the op-
erator may have thought. In fact, the conditions they
describe lead to the next sequence of events, in which
the serious problems become evident. Thus, this sum-
mary provides a transition from a situation in which
things seem to be under control to one in which they
are not.

BACK-ON-TRACK REPETITION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999642666666667">
Back-on-track repetition is a recovery device, usually
brief, which occurs after an interruption. Our tran-
script analysis suggests that its primary use is to refo-
cus the dialogue on the interrupted segment. Its form
is the same regardless of the cause of the interruption,
consisting of one of the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997125375">
• a repetition of the last concept presented (or par-
tially presented) before the interruption. This often
consists of an (almost) exact reproduction of the orig-
inal phrase;
• one or two lines summarizing the main point(s) im-
mediately preceding the interruption;
• a sentence that refers generally to the interrupted
context.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993388714285715">
Figure 3 provides an example of the first type.
Research (e.g., [Reichman, 19781, [Grosz and Sidner,
1986]) indicates that an interrupting segment is explic-
itly closed before returning to the one interrupted. Al-
though repetition cannot serve as a closing device it-
self, it frequently accompanies those that do. While
the conditions for use of back-on-track repetition are
vague, we have observed that back-on-track repetitions
very frequently accompany interruptions which occur
At this point the operator was obliged to shut off the reactor
coolant pumps, the reason being as follows: we know the
fact that there were significant vibrations as determined by
vibrational logs, and there were ammeter problems. As the
operator observed the ammeter, it was oscillating.

within a basic block, but not between them. This can be
explained by hypothesizing that if a speaker has com-
pleted a block, his mental stack is essentially empty
(except for the highest level goal); consequently there
is nothing to which to return. However, when the block
has not been completed, the speaker needs to return
attention to the open focus space on top of the stack.
This serves not only as a clue to the listener but may
also allow the speaker to collect his thoughts.
The relationship between basic blocks and repeti-
tion is strong evidence for the distinctive role played
by basic blocks in the discourse hierarchy; it also ar-
gues the inadequacy of recursive strategies to generate
these rhetorical devices. Completely recursive organi-
zational strategies assume that their operators can be
expanded at any level within the discourse hierarchy.
Consequently, we could expect them to generate tran-
sition summaries at the end of any segment of text, not
just at the end of a basic block; we could expect them
to generate final summaries at the end of any segment
which contained several constituent subsegments, not
just at the end of an entire discourse; and we could
expect them to generate back-on-track repetition after
any interruption, not only those occurring within a ba-
sic block. However, the above types of repetition ex-
hibit a distinct relationship to the basic block structure
and to no other level of segmentation smaller than the
basic block within the hierarchy. Since the application
of a recursive operator is independent of the level of
recursion, such organizational strategies cannot guar-
antee that these types of repetition will be generated
only in relation to the basic block structure.

CHARACTERISTIC HIGH-LEVEL

<bodyText confidence="0.999952">
Given the existence of a high-level structure as evi-
denced by explicit markings and repetition, we must

foci which can partition the material to be conveyed,
then any set of related concepts about which the ma-
terial can be cohesively organized would suffice. Con-
sider the motivation behind the block of Figure 1. On
the surface, the events in this block all occurred within
the first thirty seconds of the accident. However, it is
doubtful whether the driving force behind the construc-
tion of this block was to communicate the time frame
in which these events occurred; rather, what is of im-
portance is their relative sequence in the total series
of events, their cause-effect relations, and their impact
on the resulting accident. One could argue that the
individual events in this block represent a cause-effect
chain, and hence their mutual grouping; but this chain
is continued in the next block of the testimony. Ap-
parently, other factors beyond the ability to cohesively
juxtapose clauses contribute to the segmentation and
the high-level framework about which it is constructed.
In most of the dialogues examined, basic blocks from
a given discourse were of approximately the same size.
Furthermore, the size of basic blocks was approximately
the same from dialogue to dialogue; the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; size of
a basic block seems to be three or four paragraphs in
length for an explanation of three pages. We contend
that the high-level structure of extended explanations
reflects the characteristics of an &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; framework in
which:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984644833333333">
• The basic block foci about which the material is or-
ganized reflect various aspects of the unifying frame-
work.
• Basic blocks are the same size.
• The length of each basic block approximates the ideal
size.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911954545454">
Our basic block model of discourse posits that the at-
tainment of each of these features, termed compositional
goals, is instrumental in the selection of a high-level
framework.
We postulate that a speaker attempts to identify an
organizational framework that is capable of coherently
expressing all of the material he wishes to convey while
satisfying the compositional goals. Of course, a speaker
is rarely blessed with the ideal situation. As a result,
certain anomalies do occur; e.g., we have observed ex-
planations that exhibit a well-defined high-level struc-
ture that accounts for all of the basic blocks except for
the final one, which is at best loosely related to the oth-
ers. In addition, some explanations contain final sum-
maries that include material not found in the text (see
FINAL SUMMARIES), while others are composed
of blocks that are not balanced. The problem appears
to be one of finding a satisfactory, rather than an opti-
mal, unifying framework. It seems that the satisfaction
of some goals will be sacrificed in favor of others so that
a framework that provides the best overall solution will
be selected.

A MODEL FOR GENERATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996647058824">
We are currently developing a computational system
for generating extended explanations that captures
the structural characteristics observed in naturally-
occurring, descriptive explanations. Our strategy, mo-
tivated by the basic block model of discourse, is based
on the hypothesis that the high-level structure of a
discourse can be determined by bottom-up processes
that attempt to satisfy speaker, listener, and compo-
sitional goals. Once this organization has been estab-
lished, top-down processes (e.g., RST or schemas. See
[Hovy, 198813] or [McKeown, 1985], for example.) can
be used to organize the information within the resulting
basic blocks and to supplement that information based
on the choice of framework. This section describes our
general strategy for identifying an organizational frame-
work and the resulting basic blocks given an initial set
of concepts to be conveyed.

IDENTIFICATION OF CANDIDATE
FRAMEWORKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997841333333333">
We suggest that a speaker, when organizing an ex-
tended explanation, will be faced with one of the fol-
lowing general situations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9238335">
• He already has a well-defined organizational structure
in which the material to be conveyed has already been
organized.
• He has a set of goals about which he wants to struc-

as basic block foci about which he must now attempt
to partition his material.
• The speaker is starting &amp;quot;from scratch&amp;quot;; he needs to
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980053217391304">
find a unifying framework about which he can struc-
ture what he wants to say. It is this situation which
our strategy intends to capture.
Our strategy assumes that the generation process
starts with some initial state of affairs and a goal to
be achieved. Based on this, a rough set of information
to be conveyed will be identified. The selection of this
material is not our concern; rather, we are concerned
with determining a reasonable high-level structure for
this information. We assume that the material to be
conveyed has been categorized into at least two levels
of importance: that which must be included at all costs
(the kernel), and that which would be nice to include,
but due to time, style, or coherence may be left out.
The process of identifying candidate frameworks begins
with the kernel.
The implication of the discussion describing the char-
acteristics of basic blocks suggests that a unifying
framework will be some feature to which all of the ker-
nel concepts can be related. In our model, we assume
that the domain knowledge is maintained as a hierar-
chical network. Such a representation suggests that a
node to which all of these concepts converge could serve
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997724">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969390625">
as the unifying framework. The basic block foci, which
represent various aspects of this framework, would then
correspond to children of this node.
Given a set of propositions to be conveyed, one is
randomly selected from the kernel and a trace is per-
formed upwards from each of its arguments through
the hierarchy. The traversal of the hierarchy is per-
formed using generalization links, e.g. ISA, ISPART,
and SUBGOAL, incrementing counters associated with
each node that is traversed. Consider, for example, the
two propositions (agent openl Fred.!) and (object open!
valve.!). Using ISA links, we might expect a traver-
sal starting from the action open! to pass through the
nodes opening-event, general-event, etc. Furthermore,
open1 may have been a substep of a higher-level plan
which would also be encountered while performing a
traversal using SUBGOAL links. By the same token,
we could expect a traversal starting at Fredl which uses
ISA links to encounter person, animal, etc., while one
originating from valve! might pass through the nodes
valve, mechanical-device, etc. Since valvel is also part
of secondary-system!, a traversal through secondary-
system! is initiated in the same manner.
Once the traversal has been completed for each ele-
ment of the kernel, the nodes are ranked according to
their counters; this will give some idea of the number
of concepts that converge on each. Only those nodes
on which a majority of the kernel concepts converge
will be further considered as possible candidates for the
unifying framework. To continue our example, suppose
that, given a kernel of sixty propositions, our traversal
resulted in a convergence of fifty of those propositions
on the person node, ten on mechanical-device, fifteen on
event, and even fewer on the remaining nodes. Given
that we are only interested in nodes at which the major-
ity of propositions converge, only person will be given
further consideration.
In all likelihood, none of the selected candidates will
account for all of the kernel concepts. However, it may
be possible to link a candidate to concepts not directly
associated with it by finding ties between these concepts
and ones for which the candidate already accounts, pos-
sibly via a property they have in common. With respect
to our example, assume that (object open1 valve.!) does
not converge on person. However, because (agent open.!
Fred.!) does, and each of these propositions concerns the
event openl, the first proposition can be effectively in-
corporated into this framework. Additionally, it may be
possible to include such material in a final summary or
in a &amp;quot;catchall&amp;quot; block. That speakers do introduce such
material in a final summary is evidenced by the sample
final summary contained in the appendix, in which all
of the &amp;quot;significant factors&amp;quot; addressed in the summary
had been discussed in the main body of the text except
for the fourth. We claim that inclusion in a final sum-
mary is warranted if the speaker intended to include a
final summary initially, and if the amount of material
is of the same order as that comprising the individual
segments of the summary. The transcripts also supply
evidence for speakers&apos; use of catchall basic blocks at the
end of a discourse. We claim that for such an option
to be viable, there must be sufficient material to con-
struct an adequate basic block and that the material
must form a cohesive unit.&apos;

SELECTION OF THE UNIFYING
FRAMEWORK

Once potential frameworks have been identified, each
must be evaluated according to how well it meets the
criteria described above:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996172">
• How thoroughly does a candidate account for the se-
lected material?
• How uniformly does a candidate distribute the con-
cepts among the resulting basic blocks?
• How closely do the generated blocks conform to the
ideal size?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993926535714286">
Additionally, a candidate may be evaluated as to how
well it meets the needs of a user model.
The actual blocks are constructed around a candi-
date&apos;s immediate descendents, not the candidate itself.
So, for example, if a candidate were the node person,
its children - actual people involved in the events - will
become the basic block foci. The ideal case is one in
which each child of the candidate accounts for approx-
imately the same number of concepts. The balance
each candidate achieves can be determined by compar-
ing the counters of its children. At the same time,
the candidate will be rated according to how closely
its blocks conform to the ideal size. Lastly, we can
rate the candidates on how well they meet the de-
mands, if any, imposed by a user model. For exam-
ple, if we know the user is familiar with the location in
which the events occurred, basic blocks based on loca-
tion should be given higher ratings; organizing an ex-
planation around a framework with which the listener
is familiar will facilitate his assimilation of the informa-
tion.
Once this process has been accomplished, the candi-
date with the highest rating will be selected as the best
overall framework. At this point, the material has been
effectively partitioned about the resulting basic blocks;
the material within each individual block can then be
organized using a top-down methodology (e.g., RST or
schemas), and then realized into text.

adequate for local organization of text, they are insuffi-
cient for the determination of high-level structure, pro-
viding neither criteria which describe what constitutes
an acceptable framework for a discourse nor any clues as
to how this framework should be constructed. We have
presented a computational strategy for generating the
high-level structure for extended explanations that ad-
dresses both issues. Our strategy is based on the basic
block, a discourse unit consisting of an organizational
focus and text structured about that focus. We con-
tend that basic block structure cannot be adequately
generated by recursive structuring methods, but must
be identified by bottom-up strategies driven by the in-
formation to be conveyed. Support for our contentions
is provided by repetition, a device frequently used in
extended explanations for a variety of purposes.
Our analysis of high-level structure suggests a strat-
egy for generating extended explanations which we are
currently implementing as part of a larger system de-
signed to generate extended explanations in an interac-
tive environment. The system is intended as a testbed
for identifying viable organizational strategies and re-
covery techniques due to user interruptions within the
basic block paradigm. We believe that our analysis
of basic block structure provides criteria necessary for
bridging the gap between the generation of short ex-
planations and the successful generation of extended
explanations by explicating how the framework of an
extended explanation can be constructed and how rep-
etition can be cohesively incorporated into it.

APPENDIX
A sample final summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99216075308642">
That is a very quick summary of the sequence of events.
Let me turn to what we consider to be the significant factors
in the accident. [Slide] We have identified six here. These
are the same six factors which the NRC has developed and
has discussed in some of their proceedings.
Certainly, the delayed auxiliary feedwater was a signifi-
cant factor. Auxiliary feedwater block valves should have
been open. They were not. They stayed closed for about 8
minutes. That produced behavior in the reactor coolant sys-
tem which the operators were not familiar with from their
previous experience or from training, and inhibited their
ability to get the accident under control.
The second significant factor was the pilot-operated pres-
surizer relief valve not reseating. That was a straight me-
chanical failure. Probably of greater significance was the
lack of recognition of that fact until 2 and one quarter hours
into the event.
A third significant item was the securing of the shut-off
of the high-pressure injection flow prematurely. As you re-
call, I indicated that the high-pressure injection came on at
approximately 1,600 pounds, as designed. And some of the
pumps were shut down in subsequent minutes of the tran-
sient. And our calculations indicate that had those pumps
been left on and allowed to perform the high-pressure injec-
tion function, that there would not have been core damage,
there would not have been release of radioactivity at the
level that was observed at the Three Mile Island incident.
The fourth significant factor is related to containment
isolation. We have talked a little bit about that here. The
containment isolation design at Three Mile Island was one
in which the isolation occurs at a 4-pounds-per-square-inch
reactor building pressure. In other designs there are other
events which trigger containment isolation. The significance
of this isolation situation is that in the early phases of the
accident GPU had an automatic transfer of fluid from the
sump of the reactor building into the waste tanks. And
in the early phases, when we were blowing the water, the
steam, out of the relief valve into the quench tank and then
alternately when the rupture disk broke into the bottom of
the reactor building, fluid was being automatically trans-
ferred out of the reactor building into the waste tanks. The
waste tanks overflowed and spilled onto the floor of the aux-
iliary building, and radiation was released from the aux-
iliary building. And this occurred in the period prior to
the 4-pound, achieving the 4-pound pressure in the reactor
building, and the isolation associated with that.
I think this certainly calls for some reassessment. What
are the signals on which you isolate the reactor building,
and, I think equally important, the question of what lines
do you isolate and what lines do you not isolate? Because
there are some lines, such as the supply to seal injection and
the reactor coolant pumps, you do not want to isolate; you
want to leave those open. Other lines clearly you do want
to isolate. So, I think it indicates a complete reassessment
of the containment isolation philosophy.
The fifth item, identified as the &amp;quot;inappropriate emphasis
on pressurizer level indication,&amp;quot; early in the days following
the accident there was a good deal of talk about erroneous
pressurizer indication. And we have done a fair amount of
investigation and satisfied ourselves that the level indication
as displayed on the control panel was indicating essentially
the amount of water that was in the pressurizer, that there
was not an erroneous instrumentation reading, and that in
fact he had an indication of how much water was in that
pressurizer.
The point here is that he interpreted that, apparently -
we are doing a lot of reading between the lines here - but
apparently he interpreted that indication as meaning he had
a full reactor system when in fact what he had was a system
where he had the temperature of the water in the hot leg of
the reactor coolant system at the saturation pressure, and
flashing and creating steam in the reactor coolant system,
even though he had indications of full pressurizer all during
the time that he was continuing to blow steam out of the
pilot-operated relief valves.
But I think the significant factor here is the inappropriate
emphasis that was placed on the pressurizer level alone at
a time when he had other indications available to him that
should have triggered his concern about what conditions
existed in the reactor coolant system.?

Our analysis of such explanations indithat high-level structure composed of a unifyframework its associated blocks be determined by bottom-up processes that attempt to speaker, listener, and after which top-down strategies can be used to organize the material about the selected framework. In addition to a description of this structure, this paper describes three types of repetition whose use is dependent on this highlevel structure; their use not only contributes to the cohesiveness of extended explanations, but supports our thesis of the non-recursive nature of the high-level structure. We conclude with an outline of our computational strategy for generating this structure.</abstract>
