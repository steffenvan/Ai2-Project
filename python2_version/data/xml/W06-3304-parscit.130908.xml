Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999879">
With the rising influence of the Gene On-
tology, new approaches have emerged
where the similarity between genes or
gene products is obtained by comparing
Gene Ontology code annotations associ-
ated with them. So far, these approaches
have solely relied on the knowledge en-
coded in the Gene Ontology and the gene
annotations associated with the Gene On-
tology database. The goal of this paper is
to demonstrate that improvements to these
approaches can be obtained by integrating
textual evidence extracted from relevant
biomedical literature.

The establishment of similarity between genes and
gene products through homology searches has be-
come an important discovery procedure that biolo-
gists use to infer structural and functional
properties of genes and gene products–see Chang
et al. (2001) and references therein. With the rising
influence of the Gene Ontology1 (GO), new ap-
proaches have emerged where the similarity be-
tween genes or gene products is obtained by
comparing GO code annotations associated with
them. The Gene Ontology provides three orthogo-
nal networks of functional genomic concepts struc-

tured in terms of semantic relationships such as
inheritance and meronymy, which encode biologi-
cal process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cel-
lular component (CC) properties of genes and gene
products. GO code annotations explicitly relate
genes and gene products in terms of participation
in the same/similar biological processes, presence
in the same/similar cellular components and ex-
pression of the same/similar molecular functions.
Therefore, the use of GO code annotations in es-
tablishing gene and gene product similarity pro-
vides significant added functionality to methods
such as BLAST (Altschul et al. 1997) and FASTA
(Pearson and Lipman 1988) where gene and gene
product similarity is calculated using string-based
heuristics to select maximal segment pair align-
ments across gene and gene product sequences to
approximate the Smith-Waterman algorithm
(Smith and Waterman 1981).
Three main GO-based approaches have emerged
so far to compute gene and gene product similarity.
One approach assesses GO code similarity in terms
of shared hierarchical relations within each gene
ontology (BP, MF, or CC) (Lord et al. 2002, 2003;
Couto et al. 2003; Azuaje et al. 2005). For exam-
ple, the relative semantic closeness of two biologi-
cal processes would be determined by the
informational specificity of the most immediate
parent that the two biological processes share in
the BP ontology. The second approach establishes
GO code similarity by leveraging associative rela-
tions across the three gene ontologies (Bodenreider
et al. 2005). Such associative relations make pre-
dictions such as which cellular component is most
likely to be the location of a given biological proc-

ess and which molecular function is most likely to
be involved in a given biological process. The third
approach computes GO code similarity by combin-
ing hierarchical and associative relations (Posse et
al. 2006).
Several studies within the last few years
(Andrade et al. 1997, Andrade 1999, MacCallum et
al. 2000, Chang at al. 2001) have shown that the
inclusion of evidence from relevant scientific lit-
erature improves homology search. It is therefore
highly plausible that literature evidence can also
help improve GO-based approaches to gene and
gene product similarity. Sanfilippo et al. (2004)
propose a method for integrating literature evi-
dence within an early version of the GO-based
similarity algorithm presented in Posse et al.
(2006). However, no effort has been made so far in
evaluating the potential contribution of textual evi-
dence extracted from relevant biomedical literature
for GO-based approaches to the computation of
gene and gene product similarity. The goal of this
paper is to address this gap with specific reference
to the assessment of protein similarity.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999631214285714">
GO-based similarity methods that focus on meas-
uring intra-ontological relations have adopted the
information theoretic treatment of semantic simi-
larity developed in Natural Language Process-
ing−see Budanitsky (1999) for an extensive
survey. An example of such a treatment is given by
Resnik (1995), who defines semantic similarity
between two concept nodes c1 c2 in a graph as the
information content of the least common su-
perordinate (lcs) of c1 and c2, as shown in (1). The
information content of a concept node c, IC(c), is
computed as -log p(c) where p(c) indicates the
probability of encountering instances of c in a spe-
cific corpus.

Jiang and Conrath (1997) provide a refinement of
Resnik’s measure by factoring in the distance from
each concept to the least common superordinate, as
shown in (2).2

Lin (1998) provides a slight variant of Jiang’s and
Conrath’s measure, as indicated in (3).

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937888888889">
The information theoretic approach is very well
suited to assess GO code similarity since each gene
subontology is formalized as a directed acyclic
graph. In addition, the GO database3 includes nu-
merous curated GO annotations which can be used
to calculate the information content of each GO
code with high reliability. Evaluations of this
methodology have yielded promising results. For
example, Lord et al. (2002, 2003) demonstrate that
there is strong correlation between GO-based simi-
larity judgments for human proteins and similarity
judgments obtained through BLAST searches for
the same proteins. Azuaje et al. (2005) show that
there is a strong connection between the degree of
GO-based similarity and the expression correlation
of gene products.
As Bodenreider et al. (2005) remark, the main
problem with the information theoretic approach to
GO code similarity is that it does not take into ac-
count associative relations across the gene ontolo-
gies. For example, the two GO codes 0050909
(sensory perception of taste) and 0008527 (taste
receptor activity) belong to different gene ontolo-
gies (BP and MF), but they are undeniably very
closely related. The information theoretic approach
would simply miss associations of this kind as it is
not designed to capture inter-ontological relations.
Bodenreider et al. (2005) propose to recover as-
sociative relations across the gene ontologies using
a variety of statistical techniques which estimate
the similarity of two GO codes inter-ontologically
in terms of the distribution of the gene product an-
notations associated with the two GO codes in the
GO database. One such technique is an adaptation
of the vector space model frequently used in In-
formation Retrieval (Salton et al. 1975), where

each GO code is represented as a vector of gene-
based features weighted according to their distribu-
tion in the GO annotation database, and the simi-
larity between two GO codes is computed as the
cosine of the vectors for the two codes.
The ability to measure associative relations
across the gene ontologies can significantly aug-
ment the functionality of the information theoretic
approach so as to provide a more comprehensive
assessment of gene and gene product similarity.
However, in spite of their complementarities, the
two GO code similarity measures are not easily
integrated. This is because the two measures are
obtained through different methods, express dis-
tinct senses of similarity (i.e. intra- and inter-
ontological) and are thus incomparable.
Posse et al. (2006) develop a GO-based similar-
ity algorithm–XOA, short for Cross-Ontological
Analytics–capable of combining intra- and inter-
ontological relations by “translating” each associa-
tive relation across the gene ontologies into a hier-
archical relation within a single ontology. More
precisely, let c1 denote a GO code in the gene on-
tology O1 and c2 a GO code in the gene ontology
O2. The XOA similarity between c1 and c2 is de-
fined as shown in (4), where4

• maxci in Oj {f(ci)} denotes the maximum of the
function f() over all GO codes ci in the gene

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995953692307692">
The major innovation of the XOA approach is to
allow the comparison of two nodes c1, c2 across
distinct ontologies O1, O2 by mapping c1 into its
closest node c4 in O2 and c2 into its closest node
c3 in O1. The inter-ontological semantic similarity
between c1 and c2 can be then estimated from the
intra-ontological semantic similarities between c1-
4 If c1 and c2 are in the same ontology, i.e. O1=O2, then
xoa(c1,c2) is still computed as in (4). In most cases, the
maximum in (4) would be obtained with c3 = c2 and c4 = c1
so that XOA(c1,c2) would simply be computed as sim(c1,c2).
However, there are situations where there exists a GO code c3
(c4) in the same ontology which

tive relations between c2-c3 and c1-c4 as a score
enrichment device.
Posse et al. (2006) show that the XOA similarity
measure provides substantial advantages. For ex-
ample, a comparative evaluation of protein similar-
ity, following the benchmark study of Lord et al.
(2002, 2003), reveals that XOA provides the basis
for a better correlation with protein sequence simi-
larities as measured by BLAST bit score than any
intra-ontological semantic similarity measure. The
XOA similarity between genes/gene products de-
rives from the XOA similarity between GO codes.
Let GP1 and GP2 be two genes/gene products. Let
c11,c12,..., c1n denote the set of GO codes associ-
ated with GP1 and c21, c22,...., c2m the set of GO
codes associated with GP2. The XOA similarity
between GP1 and GP2 is defined as in (5), where
i=1,...,n and j=1,...,m.
(5) XOA(GP1,GP2) = max {XOA(c1i, c2j)}
The results of the study by Posse et al. (2006) are
shown in Table 1. Note that the correlation be-
tween protein similarities based on intra-
ontological similarity measures and BLAST bit
scores in Table 1 is given for each choice of gene
ontology (MF, BP, CC). This is because intra-
ontological similarity methods only take into ac-
count GO codes that are in the same ontology and
can therefore only assess protein similarity from a
single ontology viewpoint. By contrast, the XOA-
based protein similarity measure makes use of GO
codes that can belong to any of the three gene on-
tologies and needs not be broken down by single
ontologies, although the contribution of each gene
ontology or even single GO codes can still be
fleshed out, if so desired.
Is it possible to improve on these XOA results
by factoring in textual evidence? We will address
this question in the remaining part of the paper.

3 Textual Evidence Selection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918225">
Our first step in integrating textual evidence into
the XOA algorithm is to select salient information
from biomedical literature germane to the problem.
Several approaches can be used to carry out this
prerequisite. For example, one possibility is to col-
lect documents relevant to the task at hand, e.g.
through PubMed queries, and use feature weight-
ing and selection techniques from the Information
Retrieval literature−e.g. tf*idf (Buckley 1985) and
Information Gain (e.g. Yang and Pedersen
1997)−to distill the most relevant information. An-
other possibility is to use Information Extraction
algorithms tailored to the biomedical domain such
as Medstract (http://www.medstract.org, Puste-
jovsky et al. 2002) to extract entity-relationship
structures of relevance. Yet another possibility is to
use specialized tools such as GoPubMed (Doms
and Schroeder 2005) where traditional keyword-
based capabilities are coupled with term extraction
and ontological annotation techniques.
In our study, we opted for the latter solution, us-
ing generic Information Retrieval techniques to
normalize and weigh the textual evidence ex-
tracted. The main advantage of this choice is that
tools such as GoPubMed provide very high quality
term extraction at no cost. Less appealing is the
fact that the textual evidence provided is GO-based
and therefore does not offer information which is
orthogonal to the gene ontology. It is reasonable to
expect better results than those reported in this pa-
per if more GO-independent textual evidence were
brought to bear. We are currently working on using
Medstract as a source of additional textual evi-
dence.
GoPubMed is a web server which allows users
to explore PubMed search results using the Gene
Ontology for categorization and navigation pur-
poses (available at http://www.gopubmed.org). As
shown in Figure 1 below, the system offers the
following functionality:

sults by categorizing abstracts according to the
Gene Ontology

sults by GO categories
• It automatically shows GO terms related to the
original query for each result

dle windowpane of Figure 1)
• It automatically extracts terms from search

<bodyText confidence="0.971025052631579">
results which map to GO categories (e.g. high-
lighted terms other than “Rab5” in the middle
windowpane of Figure 1).
In integrating textual evidence with the XOA al-
gorithm, we utilized the last functionality (auto-
matic extraction of terms) as an Information
Extraction capability. Details about the term ex-
traction algorithm used in GoPubMed are given in
Delfs et al. (2004). In short, the GoPubMed term
extraction algorithm uses word alignment strate-
gies in combination with stemming to match word
sequences from PubMed abstracts with GO terms.
In doing so, partial and discontinuous matches are
allowed. Partial and discontinuous matches are
weighted according to closeness of fit. This is indi-
cated by the accuracy percentages associated with
GO in Figure 1 (right side). In this study we did
not make use of these accuracy percentages, but
plan to do so in the future.

Our data set consists of 2360 human protein

1783 human proteins, we made a GoPubMed query
and retrieved up to 100 abstracts. We then col-
lected all the terms extracted by GoPubMed for
each protein across the abstracts retrieved. Table 2

any problem running the full protein data set of 255,502 pairs,

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903333333333">
Using the output of the GoPubMed term extraction
process, we created vector-based signatures for
each of the 1783 proteins, where

• the value for each feature is derived as the

We then calculated the similarity between each of
the 2360 protein pairs as the cosine value of the
two vector-based signatures associated with the
protein pair.
We tried two different strategies to augment the
XOA score for protein similarity using the protein
similarity values obtained as the cosine of the
GoPubMed term-based signatures. The first strat-
egy adopts a fusion approach in which the two
similarity measures are first normalized to be
commensurable and then combined to provide an
interpretable integrated model. A simple normali-
zation is obtained by observing that the Resnik’s
information content measure is commensurable to
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996683">

<bodyText confidence="0.968690666666667">
the log of the text based cosine (LC). This leads us
to the fusion model shown in (5) for XOA, based
on Resnik’s semantic similarity measure (XOAR).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.881167">
(5) Fusion(Resnik) = XOAR + LC
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988765">
We then observe that the XOA measures based on
Resnik, Lin (XOAL) and Jiang &amp; Conrath (XOAJC)
are highly correlated (correlations exceed 0.95 on
the large benchmarking dataset discussed in sec-
tion 2, see Table 1). This suggests the fusion model
shown in (6), where the averages of the XOA
scores are computed from the benchmarking data
set.

<equation confidence="0.99029175">

Fusion(Jiang &amp; Conrath) =
XOAJC + LC*Ave(XOAJC)/Ave(XOAR)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998926">
The second strategy consists in building a predic-
tion model for BLAST bit score (BBS) using the
XOA score and the log-cosine LC as predictors
without the constraint of remaining interpretable.
As in the previous strategy, a different model was
sought for each of the three XOA variants. In each
case, we restrict ourselves to cubic polynomial re-
gression models as such models are quite efficient
at capturing complex nonlinear relationships be-
tween target and predictors (e.g. Weisberg 2005).
More precisely, for each of the semantic similarity
measures, we fit the regression model to BBS
shown in (7), where the subscript x denotes either
R, L or JC, and the coefficients a to h are found by
maximizing the Spearman rank order correlations
between BBS and the regression model. This
maximization is automatically carried out by using
a random walk optimization approach (Romeijn
1992). The coefficients used in this study for each
semantic similarity measure are shown in Table 3.

An important finding from Table 4 is that inte-
grating text-based evidence in the semantic simi-

relationships between BLAST and XOA. Not sur-
prisingly, the fusion models yield smaller im-
provements. However, these improvements in the
order of 3% for the Resnik and Lin variants are
very encouraging, even though they are not statis-
tically significant. The regression models, on the
other hand, provide larger and statistically signifi-
cant improvements, reinforcing our hypothesis that
textual evidence complements the GO-based simi-
larity measures. We expect that a more sophisti-
cated NLP treatment of textual evidence will yield
significant improvements even for the more inter-
pretable fusion models.

Several approaches can be used to carry out this prerequisite. For example, one possibility is to collect documents relevant to the task at hand, e.g. through PubMed queries, and use feature weighting and selection techniques from the Information Retrieval literature−e.g. tf*idf (Buckley 1985) and Information Gain (e.g. Yang and Pedersen 1997)−to distill the most relevant information. Another possibility is to use Information Extraction algorithms tailored to the biomedical domain such as Medstract (http://www.medstract.org, Pustejovsky et al. 2002) to extract entity-relationship structures of relevance.

The goal of this paper is to address this gap with specific reference to the assessment of protein similarity. 2 Background GO-based similarity methods that focus on measuring intra-ontological relations have adopted the information theoretic treatment of semantic similarity developed in Natural Language Processing−see Budanitsky (1999) for an extensive survey. An example of such a treatment is given by Resnik (1995), who defines semantic similarity between two concept nodes c1 c2 in a graph as the information content of the least common superordinate (lcs) of c1 and c2, as shown in (1). The information content of a concept node c, IC(c), is computed as -log p(c) where p(c) indicates the probability of encountering instances of c in a specific corpus. sim(c ,c ) IC(lcs(c ,c )) 1 2 = 1 2 = (1) = −log p(lcs(c ,c )) 1 2 Jiang and Conrath (1997) provide a refinement of Resnik’s measure by factoring in the distance from each conc</context>

(2001) and references therein. With the rising influence of the Gene Ontology1 (GO), new approaches have emerged where the similarity between genes or gene products is obtained by comparing GO code annotations associated with them. The Gene Ontology provides three orthogonal networks of functional genomic concepts struc1 http://www.geneontology.org. tured in terms of semantic relationships such as inheritance and meronymy, which encode biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cellular component (CC) properties of genes and gene products.

In integrating textual evidence with the XOA algorithm, we utilized the last functionality (automatic extraction of terms) as an Information Extraction capability. Details about the term extraction algorithm used in GoPubMed are given in Delfs et al. (2004). In short, the GoPubMed term extraction algorithm uses word alignment strategies in combination with stemming to match word sequences from PubMed abstracts with GO terms. In doing so, partial and discontinuous matches are allowed. Partial and discontinuous matches are weighted according to closeness of fit. This is indicated by the accuracy percentages associated with GO in Figure 1 (right side).

The main advantage of this choice is that tools such as GoPubMed provide very high quality term extraction at no cost. Less appealing is the fact that the textual evidence provided is GO-based and therefore does not offer information which is orthogonal to the gene ontology.

An example of such a treatment is given by Resnik (1995), who defines semantic similarity between two concept nodes c1 c2 in a graph as the information content of the least common superordinate (lcs) of c1 and c2, as shown in (1). The information content of a concept node c, IC(c), is computed as -log p(c) where p(c) indicates the probability of encountering instances of c in a specific corpus. sim(c ,c ) IC(lcs(c ,c )) 1 2 = 1 2 = (1) = −log p(lcs(c ,c )) 1 2 Jiang and Conrath (1997) provide a refinement of Resnik’s measure by factoring in the distance from each concept to the least common superordinate, as shown in (2).2 2 Jiang and Conrath (1997</context>

The third approach computes GO code similarity by combining hierarchical and associative relations (Posse et al. 2006). Several studies within the last few years (Andrade et al. 1997, Andrade 1999, MacCallum et al. 2000, Chang at al. 2001) have shown that the inclusion of evidence from relevant scientific literature improves homology search. It is therefore highly plausible that literature evidence can also help improve GO-based approaches to gene and gene product similarity. Sanfilippo et al. (2004) propose a method for integrating literature evidence within an early version of the GO-based similarity algorithm presented in Posse et al. (2006). However, no effort has been made so far in evaluating the potential contribution of textual evidence extracted from relevant biomedical literature for GO-based approaches to the computation of gene and gene product similarity.

The information theoretic approach would simply miss associations of this kind as it is not designed to capture inter-ontological relations. Bodenreider et al. (2005) propose to recover associative relations across the gene ontologies using a variety of statistical techniques which estimate the similarity of two GO codes inter-ontologically in terms of the distribution of the gene product annotations associated with the two GO codes in the GO database. One such technique is an adaptation of the vector space model frequently used in Information Retrieval (Salton et al. 1975), where For ease of exposition, we have converted Jiang’s and Conrath’s semantic distance measure to semantic similarity by taking its inverse, following Pedersen et al. (2005). 3 http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database. )) )) 26 each GO code is represented as a vector of genebased features weighted according to their distribution in the GO annotation database, and the similarity between two GO codes is computed as the cosine of the vectors for the two codes. The ability to measure associative relations across the gene ontologies can significantly augment the functionality of the information th</context>

Therefore, the use of GO code annotations in establishing gene and gene product similarity provides significant added functionality to methods such as BLAST (Altschul et al. 1997) and FASTA (Pearson and Lipman 1988) where gene and gene product similarity is calculated using string-based heuristics to select maximal segment pair alignments across gene and gene product sequences to approximate the Smith-Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman 1981). Three main GO-based approaches have emerged so far to compute gene and gene product similarity. One approach assesses GO code similarity in terms of shared hierarchical relations within each gene ontology (BP, MF, or CC) (Lord et al. 2002, 2003; Couto et al. 2003; Azuaje et al. 2005). For example, the relative semantic closeness of two biological processes would be determined by the informational specificity of the most immediate parent that the two biological processes share in the BP ontology. The second approach establishes GO code similarity by leveraging associative relations across the</context>

(6) Fusion(Lin) = XOAL + LC*Ave( XOAL)/Ave(XOAR) Fusion(Jiang &amp; Conrath) = XOAJC + LC*Ave(XOAJC)/Ave(XOAR) The second strategy consists in building a prediction model for BLAST bit score (BBS) using the XOA score and the log-cosine LC as predictors without the constraint of remaining interpretable. As in the previous strategy, a different model was sought for each of the three XOA variants. In each case, we restrict ourselves to cubic polynomial regression models as such models are quite efficient at capturing complex nonlinear relationships between target and predictors (e.g. Weisberg 2005). More precisely, for each of the semantic similarity measures, we fit the regression model to BBS shown in (7), where the subscript x denotes either R, L or JC, and the coefficients a to h are found by maximizing the Spearman rank order correlations between BBS and the regression model. This maximization is automatically carried out by using a random walk optimization approach (Romeijn 1992). The coefficients used in this study for each semantic similarity measure are shown in Table 3.
