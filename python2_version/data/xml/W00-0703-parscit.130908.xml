Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999683583333333">
The prevailing dual-route model of oral read-
ing claims that a lexical route is used for the
pronunciation of words and a non-lexical route
processes nonwords. Neurological data from pa-
tients with acquired dyslexias have been high-
lighted to support this claim. Models using a
lexicon alone are generally held to be incapable
of explaining these data. However, by selec-
tively impairing its component parts, it is easily
possible to account for phonological and surface
dyslexias using a single-route model based upon
pronunciation by analogy.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999781163636364">
We have previously developed pronunciation by
analogy (PbA) as a model of reading aloud and
as a method for automatic phonemisation in
text-to-speech synthesis (Sullivan and Damper,
1993; Damper and Eastmond, 1997; Marchand
and Damper, 2000). We have also demon-
strated (Damper et al., 1999) that the perfor-
mance of PbA in producing correct pronunci-
ations is vastly superior to manually-written
rules and significantly better than the competi-
tor data-driven techniques of back-propagation
(Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; McCulloch et
al., 1987) and the IB1-IG method based on
information gain weighting (Daelemans et al.,
1997). Although we cannot claim that PbA is
absolutely the best method for pronunciation
generation, it must be taken seriously. This
view is clearly shared by other workers who
are actively developing analogical methods for
natural language processing tasks (Pirrelli and
Federici, 1995; Jones, 1996; Yvon, 1996; 1997;
Bagshaw, 1998; Pirrelli and Yvon, 1999).
Explicit analogy (e.g., Dedina and Nusbaum,
1991; Damper and Eastmond, 1997) retains the
lexicon in its entirety, typically as a list of words
and their spellings. PbA requires a dictionary in
which text and phonemics have been aligned, so
that pronunciations corresponding to matching
orthographic substrings can be identified. How-
ever, many of the necessary computational steps
to assemble a pronunciation can be carried out
in advance. Thus, in implicit analogy (e.g., Sul-
livan and Damper, 1993), the lexical database is
precompiled to yield a generalised phonological
knowledge base which is consulted during pro-
nunciation generation. This done, the (explicit)
dictionary can be discarded. Implicit analogy
may also attempt to compress the training data,
so that some proportion is discarded.
Here, we extend earlier work on modelling
pronunciation by normal readers to impaired
readers with acquired dyslexias. There are sev-
eral forms of this: two of the most important
are phonological and surface dyslexia. Cases
of phonological dyslexia display good ability
to read words (both regular and irregularly-
spelled) aloud but poor nonword reading abil-
ity (Beauvois and Derouesne, 1979). In surface
dyslexia, however, patients misread irregularly
spelled words, which tend to be regularised in
their pronunciation (Coltheart et al., 1983). To
simulate these dyslexias, we use explicit PbA
without compression. The approach is to dam-
age the model and then to observe its ability to
replicate the neuropsychological data.

2 Dual and Single Routes to Sound
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916333333333">
The nature of the cognitive processes underly-
ing the act of reading aloud has spawned an im-
portant and controversial debate in psychology
(Humphreys and Evett, 1985; Seidenberg and
McClelland, 1989; Coltheart et al., 1993; Plaut
et al., 1996). One popular view is that there are
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998337">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972761194031">
two routes from print to sound: a lexical and a
nonlexical route (Coltheart, 1978). The former
involves access to lexical knowledge for familiar
words. The second route concerns the pronunci-
ation of unfamiliar words or pronounceable non-
words and is thought to operate on the basis of
a set of abstract spelling-to-sound rules. The
strong version of this dual-route theory claims
that nonwords are segmented at the level of the
grapheme and that the pronunciation of non-
words is not influenced by lexical information.
A line of evidence generally held to support the
model comes from neuropsychological studies of
acquired dyslexia. For instance, the patient WB
studied by Funnell (1983) is considered a par-
ticularly pure case of phonological dyslexia with
good reading of words and poor reading of non-
words. This case appears to conform to one
of the main predictions of dual-route theory:
namely, that neurological damage could selec-
tively impair either processing route, so that
a patient may have impaired processing in one
system but intact processing in the other.
Nonetheless, the dual-route model has been
criticised by different authors (Marcel, 1980;
Kay and Marcel, 1981; Glushko, 1981; Shal-
lice et al., 1983; Humphreys and Evett, 1985;
McCarthy and Warrington, 1986) who empha-
sise that nonword pronunciation can be subject
to lexical influences and/or argue for &amp;quot;multi-
ple levels&amp;quot; of processing. Two main alterna-
tives have been proposed to counter these ob-
jections: a single-route framework and a modi-
fied dual-route model. The first claims that all
print-to-sound conversion is realised through a
lexical route. That is, oral reading involves pro-
cesses that all operate on a lexical database so
that words and nonwords can be produced by
the same mechanism. However, there has some-
times been a lack of clarity in defining such a
single-route mechanism. Often, some kind of
analogy process is posited, but its precise form
has rarely been specified. Hence, informed com-
mentators have most often been inclined to re-
form and repair the dual-route theory by re-
laxing its strong assumptions, either to allow
an interaction between routes (Reggia et al.,
1988) or to extend the notion of grapheme-
phoneme correspondence (Patterson and Mor-
ton, 1985) by introducing the notion of body—
the vowel-plus-terminal-consonant segment of
monosyllabic words.
The dual-route model has been more recently
questioned by a plethora of single-route com-
putational models based on connectionist prin-
ciples (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; Seiden-
berg and McClelland, 1989; Hinton and Shal-
lice, 1991; Plaut et al., 1996; Bullinaria, 1997;
Ans et al., 1998; Zorzi et al., 1998). Less often
has analogy been used as the basis of a single-
route model. The idea that pseudowords can be
pronounced by analogy with lexical words that
they resemble has a long history (Baron, 1977;
Brooks, 1977; Glushko, 1979). In place of ab-
stract letter-to-sound rules in dual-route models
we have specific patterns of correspondence in
single-route analogy models.

3 Implementing PbA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999494303030303">
In PbA, an unknown word is pronounced by
matching substrings of the input to substrings
of known, lexical words, hypothesizing a partial
pronunciation for each matched substring from
the phonological knowledge, and assembling the
partial pronunciations. Here, we use an ex-
tended and improved version of the system de-
scribed by Dedina and Nusbaum (1991), which
consists of four components: the (uncompressed
and previously aligned) lexical database, the
matcher which compares the target input to
all the words in the database, the pronuncia-
tion lattice (a data structure representing pos-
sible pronunciations), and the decision func-
tion, which selects the &apos;best&apos; pronunciation
among the set of possible ones. The lexi-
con used is Webster&apos;s Pocket Dictionary, con-
taining 20,009 words manually aligned by Se-
jnowski and Rosenberg (1987) for training their
NETtalk neural network.
Pattern Matching: An incoming word is
matched in turn against all orthographic en-
tries in the lexicon. For a given entry, assume
the process starts with the input string and
the dictionary entry left-aligned. Substrings
sharing contiguous, common letters in match-
ing positions are then found. Information about
these matching letter substrings and their cor-
responding, aligned phoneme substrings in the
dictionary entry under consideration is entered
into a pronunciation lattice—see below. One
of the two strings is then shifted right by one
letter and the matching process repeated, until
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994371">
14
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996719779069768">
some termination condition is met. This process
can be alternatively seen as a matching between
substrings of the incoming word, segmented in
all possible ways, and the dictionary entries.
Pronunciation Lattice: A node of the lat-
tice represents a matched letter, Li, at some
position, i, in the input. The node is labelled
with its position index i and with the phoneme
which corresponds to Li in the matched sub-
string, Pim, say, for the mth matched substring.
An arc is placed from node i to node j if there
is a matched substring starting with Li and
ending with Li. The arc is labelled with the
phonemes intermediate between Pim and Prn,
in the phoneme part of the matched substring.
Additionally, arcs are labelled with a &apos;frequency&apos;
count which is incremented each time that sub-
string (with that pronunciation) is matched
during the pass through the lexicon.
Decision Function: A possible pronuncia-
tion for the input corresponds to a com-
plete path through its lattice, from Start to
End nodes, with the output string assembled
by concatenating the phoneme labels on the
nodes/arcs in the order that they are traversed.
(Different paths can, of course, correspond to
the same pronunciation.) Scoring of candidate
pronunciation uses two heuristics. If there is
a unique shortest path, then the correspond-
ing pronunciation is taken as the output. If
there are tied shortest paths, then the pronunci-
ation corresponding to the best scoring of these
is taken as the output.
This also offers a way of simulating the &apos;word
segmentation&apos; test of Funnell (1983), in which
patients have to find words &apos;hidden&apos; in letter
strings. First, there is an initial segmentation
in which the input string is segmented in all
possible ways, as in &apos;regular&apos; PbA. Then, if
any of these substrings produces a lattice with
a length-1 arc, this identifies a lexical word.
A single-route connectionist model or abstract
rules (or, for that matter, implicit PbA) can not
do this without some extension to maintain ex-
plicit knowledge of lexical status. Of course, it
is possible that a patient can perform the first
of these steps, but not the second. This is the
difference between our &apos;unconscious&apos; and &apos;con-
scious&apos; segmentations (see below) so-called be-
cause, in the latter, the patient is aware that
he/she has to find a hidden word.
This particular implementation of PbA does
not guarantee an output pronunciation. A com-
plete path through the lattice requires that all
nodes on that path (except the first and last)
are linked by at least one arc. Clearly, each arc
must have a node at either end. Although an
arc may have an empty label, a node cannot.
Hence, the minimum matching segment length
corresponds to a letter bigram. It may be that
no matching bigram exists in some cases. So
there with be no complete path through the lat-
tice and no pronunciation can be inferred—the
&apos;silence problem&apos;.
Recent Improvements: The implementa-
tion used here features several enhancements
over the original Dedina and Nusbaum (D&amp;N)
system (Marchand and Damper, 2000). First,
we use &apos;full&apos; pattern matching between input
letter string and dictionary entries, as opposed
to the &apos;partial&apos; matching of D&amp;N. That is,
rather than starting with the two strings left-
aligned, we start with the initial letter of the
input string I aligned with the last letter of
the dictionary entry W. The matching process
terminates not when the two strings are right-
aligned, but when the last letter of I aligns
with initial letter of W. Second, multiple (five)
heuristics are used to score the candidate pro-
nunciations. Individual scores are then multi-
plied together to produce a final overall score.
The best-scoring pronunciation is then selected
as output. Marchand and Damper show that
this &apos;multi-strategy&apos; approach gives statistically
significant performance improvements over sim-
pler versions of PbA.

By selective impairment of component parts
of the PbA model, we have simulated read-

tients (WB and FL) studied by Funnell (1983).
(The reader is referred to this original source for
specifications of the tests and materials.) While
the first of these patients has often been cited
as a key individual strongly supporting dual-
route theory, we believe that FL (who has been
largely ignored) is actually a counter-example.
FL was unable to supply a sound for single
letters (which argues that the abstract rule-
based route is impaired) although she could

For patient WB, two different versions of im-
paired PbA have been studied. Version 1 sup-
poses that brain damage has induced a partial
loss of words from his mental lexicon (the 15%
that he can not read aloud) and a total break-
down of his concatenation mechanism. Ver-
sion 2 supposes that WB&apos;s impairment results
from injury to one component only; namely, the
process of segmentation into all possible sub-
strings is partially damaged. In Version 2, we
stress the distinction made earlier between this
basic (unconscious) segmentation process and
Funnell&apos;s (conscious) segmentation. The un-
conscious segmentation is that embodied in the
PbA pattern matching when WB is asked to
read some string. For this specific patient, we
postulate damage to the segmentation compo-
nent such that it can only process substrings of
length between 5 and 7. The conscious segmen-
tation is that used when WB is asked to find
words within strings and to read them aloud.
This process is assumed to be fully operational.
For patient FL, a single &apos;faulty&apos; version of PbA
has been developed which postulates a defi-
ciency of (unconscious) segmentation such that
substrings of length less than three cannot be
used in pattern matching.
Table 1 shows reading accuracy for pa-
tient WB for the various tests performed by
Funnell together with the corresponding results
of simulations of impaired and non-faulty PbA.
Table 2 shows the results for patient FL read-
ing aloud and the corresponding simulation of
faulty and non-faulty PbA. Evidently, it is
possible to reproduce quite well both patients&apos;
symptoms. Indeed, with Version 1, we can in-
terpret WB&apos;s condition very directly: The con-
catenation process involved in nonword reading
is completely destroyed but the mental lexicon
is relatively spared. Because of the absence of
some compound words (e.g., gentlelman) from
the dictionary, the simulations concerning &amp;quot;par-
ent words&amp;quot; (e.g., father is the parent of fat and
her) for both Test 1 and Test 2 are not perfect.
Version 2 is slightly poorer but still close to the
neuropsychological data. For patient FL, the
faulty version reproduces her impaired reading
of single letters and &apos;easy&apos; nonwords very well,
but does so less well for &apos;difficult&apos; nonwords.

The simulations also handle the fact that these
patients were completely unable to read single
letters: the silence problem (see above) can oc-
cur for single letters by virtue of the form of
the pronunciation lattice used, which requires
matching bigrams (at least) at all positions to
produce a pronunciation.

5 Modelling Surface Dyslexia
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979944444444">
We have also modelled data from patient KT
described by McCarthy and Warrington (1986).
KT was able to pronounce regular words and
nonwords very well but had serious difficulty in
reading irregular words, tending to produce reg-
ularisation errors. (Again, limitations of space
mean we must refer the reader to the original
source for details of the reading tests and mate-
rials.) Together with WB, these patients have
been taken as almost an existence proof of dual
routes which can be differentially damaged.
We suppose that KT&apos;s impairment re-
sults from injury to two components of the
PbA model. First, as in phonological dyslexia,
we assume that the process of segmentation
into all possible substrings is partially dam-
aged. More specifically, we postulate a defi-
ciency concerning the size of the window in-
volved in the pattern matching. Second, it is
assumed that one or several (of the total of five)
multi-strategies may be degraded.
The simulations were obtained for a model
with damage in the third and fourth multi-
strategies (see Marchand and Damper, 2000,
for detailed specification) and only substrings
of length between 2 and 4 can be segmented in
pattern matching. Table 3 shows KT&apos;s mean
reading accuracy over the various tests per-
formed by McCarthy and Warrington together
with our corresponding simulation results for
impaired and non-faulty PbA. Clearly, it is pos-
sible to reproduce quite well the patient&apos;s car-
dinal symptoms: his ability to pronounce regu-
lar words much better than irregular ones. The
incorrect pronunciations show a clear regulari-
sation effect (not detailed here).

<abstract confidence="0.989999384615385">The prevailing dual-route model of oral reading claims that a lexical route is used for the pronunciation of words and a non-lexical route processes nonwords. Neurological data from patients with acquired dyslexias have been highlighted to support this claim. Models using a lexicon alone are generally held to be incapable of explaining these data. However, by selectively impairing its component parts, it is easily possible to account for phonological and surface dyslexias using a single-route model based upon pronunciation by analogy.</abstract>

Here, we extend earlier work on modelling pronunciation by normal readers to impaired readers with acquired dyslexias. There are several forms of this: two of the most important are phonological and surface dyslexia. Cases of phonological dyslexia display good ability to read words (both regular and irregularlyspelled) aloud but poor nonword reading ability (Beauvois and Derouesne, 1979).

The second route concerns the pronunciation of unfamiliar words or pronounceable nonwords and is thought to operate on the basis of a set of abstract spelling-to-sound rules. The strong version of this dual-route theory claims that nonwords are segmented at the level of the grapheme and that the pronunciation of nonwords is not influenced by lexical information. A line of evidence generally held to support the model comes from neuropsychological studies of acquired dyslexia. For instance, the patient WB studied by Funnell (1983) is considered a particularly pure case of phonological dyslexia with good reading of words and poor reading of nonwords. This case appears to conform to one of the main predictions of dual-route theory: namely, that neurological damage could selectively impair either processing route, so that a patient may have impaired processing in one system but intact processing in the other. Nonetheless, the dual-route model has been criticised by different authors (Marcel, 1980; Kay and Marcel, 1981; Glushko, 1981; Shallice et al., 1983; Humphreys and Evett, 1985; McCarthy and Warrington, 1986) who emph</context>

(Different paths can, of course, correspond to the same pronunciation.) Scoring of candidate pronunciation uses two heuristics. If there is a unique shortest path, then the corresponding pronunciation is taken as the output. If there are tied shortest paths, then the pronunciation corresponding to the best scoring of these is taken as the output. This also offers a way of simulating the &apos;word segmentation&apos; test of Funnell (1983), in which patients have to find words &apos;hidden&apos; in letter strings. First, there is an initial segmentation in which the input string is segmented in all possible ways, as in &apos;regular&apos; PbA. Then, if any of these substrings produces a lattice with a length-1 arc, this identifies a lexical word. A single-route connectionist model or abstract rules (or, for that matter, implicit PbA) can not do this without some extension to maintain explicit knowledge of lexical status. Of course, it is possible that a patient can perform the first of these steps, but not the second. This is the difference betwee</context>

The best-scoring pronunciation is then selected as output. Marchand and Damper show that this &apos;multi-strategy&apos; approach gives statistically significant performance improvements over simpler versions of PbA. 4 Modelling Phonological Dyslexia By selective impairment of component parts of the PbA model, we have simulated reading data from the two phonological dyslexic patients (WB and FL) studied by Funnell (1983). (The reader is referred to this original source for specifications of the tests and materials.) While the first of these patients has often been cited as a key individual strongly supporting dualroute theory, we believe that FL (who has been largely ignored) is actually a counter-example. FL was unable to supply a sound for single letters (which argues that the abstract rulebased route is impaired) although she could read non-words normally (which contradicts the 15 Table 1: Reading performance of patient WB and versions of faulty and non-faulty PbA. &apos;Words (712)&apos; refers to a random sampling</context>

In surface dyslexia, however, patients misread irregularly spelled words, which tend to be regularised in their pronunciation (Coltheart et al., 1983). To simulate these dyslexias, we use explicit PbA without compression. The approach is to damage the model and then to observe its ability to replicate the neuropsychological data. 2 Dual and Single Routes to Sound The nature of the cognitive processes underlying the act of reading aloud has spawned an important and controversial debate in psychology (Humphreys and Evett, 1985; Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989; Coltheart et al., 1993; Plaut et al., 1996). One popular view is that there are 13 two routes from print to sound: a lexical and a nonlexical route (Coltheart, 1978). The former involves access to lexical knowledge for familiar words. The second route concerns the pronunciation of unfamiliar words or pronounceable nonwords and is thought to operate on the basis of a set of abstract spelling-to-sound rules.

Models using a lexicon alone are generally held to be incapable of explaining these data. However, by selectively impairing its component parts, it is easily possible to account for phonological and surface dyslexias using a single-route model based upon pronunciation by analogy. 1 Introduction We have previously developed pronunciation by analogy (PbA) as a model of reading aloud and as a method for automatic phonemisation in text-to-speech synthesis (Sullivan and Damper, 1993; Damper and Eastmond, 1997; Marchand and Damper, 2000). We have also demonstrated (Damper et al., 1999) that the performance of PbA in producing correct pronunciations is vastly superior to manually-written rules and significantly better than the competitor data-driven techniques of back-propagation (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; McCulloch et al., 1987) and the IB1-IG method based on information gain weighting (Daelemans et al., 1997).

Clearly, each arc must have a node at either end. Although an arc may have an empty label, a node cannot. Hence, the minimum matching segment length corresponds to a letter bigram. It may be that no matching bigram exists in some cases. So there with be no complete path through the lattice and no pronunciation can be inferred—the &apos;silence problem&apos;. Recent Improvements: The implementation used here features several enhancements over the original Dedina and Nusbaum (D&amp;N) system (Marchand and Damper, 2000). First, we use &apos;full&apos; pattern matching between input letter string and dictionary entries, as opposed to the &apos;partial&apos; matching of D&amp;N. That is, rather than starting with the two strings leftaligned, we start with the initial letter of the input string I aligned with the last letter of the dictionary entry W.

We suppose that KT&apos;s impairment results from injury to two components of the PbA model. First, as in phonological dyslexia, we assume that the process of segmentation into all possible substrings is partially damaged. More specifically, we postulate a deficiency concerning the size of the window involved in the pattern matching. Second, it is assumed that one or several (of the total of five) multi-strategies may be degraded. The simulations were obtained for a model with damage in the third and fourth multistrategies (see Marchand and Damper, 2000, for detailed specification) and only substrings of length between 2 and 4 can be segmented in pattern matching. Table 3 shows KT&apos;s mean reading accuracy over the various tests performed by McCarthy and Warrington together with our corresponding simulation results for impaired and non-faulty PbA.

KT was able to pronounce regular words and nonwords very well but had serious difficulty in reading irregular words, tending to produce regularisation errors.

Here, we use an extended and improved version of the system described by Dedina and Nusbaum (1991), which consists of four components: the (uncompressed and previously aligned) lexical database, the matcher which compares the target input to all the words in the database, the pronunciation lattice (a data structure representing possible pronunciations), and the decision function, which selects the &apos;best&apos; pronunciation among the set of possible ones. The lexicon used is Webster&apos;s Pocket Dictionary, containing 20,009 words manually aligned by Sejnowski and Rosenberg (1987) for training their NETtalk neural network. Pattern Matching: An incoming word is matched in turn against all orthographic entries in the lexicon. For a given entry, assume the process starts with the input string and the dictionary entry left-aligned. Substrings sharing contiguous, common letters in matching positions are then found. Information about these matching letter substrings and their corresponding, aligned phoneme substrings in the dictionary entry under consideration is entered into a pronunciation lattice—see below.

For instance, the patient WB studied by Funnell (1983) is considered a particularly pure case of phonological dyslexia with good reading of words and poor reading of nonwords. This case appears to conform to one of the main predictions of dual-route theory: namely, that neurological damage could selectively impair either processing route, so that a patient may have impaired processing in one system but intact processing in the other. Nonetheless, the dual-route model has been criticised by different authors (Marcel, 1980; Kay and Marcel, 1981; Glushko, 1981; Shallice et al., 1983; Humphreys and Evett, 1985; McCarthy and Warrington, 1986) who emphasise that nonword pronunciation can be subject to lexical influences and/or argue for &amp;quot;multiple levels&amp;quot; of processing. Two main alternatives have been proposed to counter these objections: a single-route framework and a modified dual-route model. The first claims that all print-to-sound conversion is realised through a lexical route. That is, oral reading involves processes that all operate on a lexical database so that words and nonwords can be produced by the same mechanism.

Neurological data from patients with acquired dyslexias have been highlighted to support this claim. Models using a lexicon alone are generally held to be incapable of explaining these data. However, by selectively impairing its component parts, it is easily possible to account for phonological and surface dyslexias using a single-route model based upon pronunciation by analogy. 1 Introduction We have previously developed pronunciation by analogy (PbA) as a model of reading aloud and as a method for automatic phonemisation in text-to-speech synthesis (Sullivan and Damper, 1993; Damper and Eastmond, 1997; Marchand and Damper, 2000).

Explicit analogy (e.g., Dedina and Nusbaum, 1991; Damper and Eastmond, 1997) retains the lexicon in its entirety, typically as a list of words and their spellings. PbA requires a dictionary in which text and phonemics have been aligned, so that pronunciations corresponding to matching orthographic substrings can be identified. However, many of the necessary computational steps to assemble a pronunciation can be carried out in advance. Thus, in implicit analogy (e.g., Sullivan and Damper, 1993), the lexical database is precompiled to yield a generalised phonological knowledge base which is consulted during pronunciation generation. This done, the (explicit) dictionary can be discarded. Implicit analogy may also attempt to compress the training data, so that some proportion is discarded. Here, we extend earlier work on modelling pronunciation by normal readers to impaired readers with acquired dyslexias. There are several forms of this: two of the most important are phonological and surface dyslexia. Cases of phonological dyslexia display good ability to read words (both regular and </context>

The dual-route model has been more recently questioned by a plethora of single-route computational models based on connectionist principles (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989; Hinton and Shallice, 1991; Plaut et al., 1996; Bullinaria, 1997; Ans et al., 1998; Zorzi et al., 1998). Less often has analogy been used as the basis of a singleroute model. The idea that pseudowords can be pronounced by analogy with lexical words that they resemble has a long history (Baron, 1977; Brooks, 1977; Glushko, 1979). In place of abstract letter-to-sound rules in dual-route models we have specific patterns of correspondence in single-route analogy models. 3 Implementing PbA In PbA, an unknown word is pronounced by matching substrings of the input to substrings of known, lexical words, hypothesizing a partial pronunciation for each matched substring from the phonological knowledge, an</context>
