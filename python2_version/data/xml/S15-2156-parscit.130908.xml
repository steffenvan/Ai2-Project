Taxonomy structures are important tools in
the science of classification of things or
concepts, including the principles that un-
derlie such classification. This paper pre-
sents an approach to the problem of
taxonomy construction from texts focusing
on the hyponym-hypernym relation between
two terms. Given a set of terms in a particu-
lar domain, the approach in this study uses
Wikipedia and WordNet as knowledge
sources and applies the information extrac-
tion methods to analyze and establish the
hyponym-hypernym relationship between
two terms. Our system is ranked fourth
among the participating systems in
SemEval-2015 task 17.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999964456521739">
Taxonomies are essential tools for many Natural
Language Processing (NLP) applications and the
backbone of many structured knowledge re-
sources. Taxonomies specific to a domain are
becoming indispensable to a growing number of
applications (Velardi et al., 2013). Several state-
of-the-art approaches already exist to extract tax-
onomies to characterize the domains of interest
from the corpus using the information extraction
techniques. Recently, attention has been devoted
to inducing the taxonomy from a set of keyword
phrases instead of from a text corpus (Liu et al.,
2012). Such approaches enrich the set of key-
word phrases by aggregating search results for
each keyword phrase into a text corpus to over-
come the lack of explicit relationships between
keyword phrases from which the taxonomy can
be induced.
This approach faces a key challenge of ex-
tracting explicit relationships among keyword
phrases. However, semantic relatedness between
concepts in a domain is an important clue to ex-
tracting their taxonomy relationships. An im-
portant contribution in relation to this is reported
by Gabrilovich et al. (2007) that present an ex-
plicit semantic analysis using the natural con-
cepts and propose a uniform method of
computing relatedness of both individual concept
and arbitrarily long text fragments. Lexical data-
bases such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) encode
relations between words such as synonymy and
hypernymy. Quite a few metrics have been de-
fined that compute relatedness using various
properties of the underlying graph structures of
these resources. The obvious drawback of this
approach is that the creation of lexical resources
requires the lexicographic expertise as well as a
lot of time and effort, and consequently such re-
sources cover only a small fragment of the lan-
guage lexicon. Specifically, such the resources
contain few proper names, neologisms, slang,
and domain-specific technical terms. Further-
more, these resources have strong lexical orienta-
tion and mainly contain information about
individual words but little world knowledge in
general.

With the advent of new information sources,
many new methods and ideas are developed for
the large scale information extraction taking ad-
vantages of huge amounts of unstructured availa-
ble resources. Barbu and Poesio (2009) propose a
novel method for acquisition of knowledge for
taxonomies of concepts from the raw Wikipedia
text. Their approach uses the learning process to
derive concept hierarchies from WordNet and
maps them to Wikipedia pages for extraction of
appropriate knowledge. Most state-of-the-art ap-
proaches for the domain-specific taxonomy in-
duction use the text corpus as its input and some
information extraction methods to extract onto-
logical relationships from the text corpus, and
finally apply the relationships to build the taxon-
omy. Other automatic approaches to taxonomy
construction from texts include a statistical meth-
od to compare the syntactic context of terms for
taxonomic relations identification (Tuan et al.,
2014).
There have been a number of handcrafted,
well-structured taxonomies publicly available
online, including WordNet (Miller, 1995). How-
ever, such taxonomies are also not perfect since
human experts are liable to miss some relevant
terms.
In this study, we consider the challenging
problem of deriving taxonomies of a set of con-
cepts under a specific domain of interest. Consid-
er for illustration, the domain vehicle containing
concepts such as car, bicycle, Toyota, automo-
bile, bus, Toyota_cambire, cruiser and Motorcy-
cle. Establishing hyponym-hypernym
relationships among concepts is a difficult task if
no other information is provided. We propose an
approach to the taxonomy extraction task in
SemEval-2015 (Bordea et al., 2015) with the fol-
lowing contributions:

cepts in a domain with a Bayesian Rose

• The study finally extracts taxonomies for
domain concepts using the BRT tree and
WordNet type binary relations.
Bayesian hierarchical clustering algorithm
(BRT) is used to cluster concepts having hypo-
nym-hypernym relationships (Blundell et al.,

Wikipedia and WordNet have drawn attentions
on derivation of concepts for taxonomy construc-
tion (Barbu and Poesio, 2009; Song et al., 2011)
and the syntactic conceptual taxonomy (Tuan et
al. 2014).
In this study, to generate definitions for con-
cepts and map concepts and keywords in defini-
tions to a BRT tree for taxonomy extraction, we
follow the steps below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9426286">
• First, given a concept, we use WordNet
and Wikipedia to derive its definitions. In
addition, the related WordNet synset and
Wikipedia category are extracted for the
taxonomy induction.
• Using the Wikipedia categories that de-
scribe the corresponding concept article,
the WordNet sense, and the WordNet
hyponym tree from the first step, the
study uses a binary tree to represent each
concept in the given domain. The left
node represents the set of terms consid-
ered to be hypernyms and the right node
represents the set of terms considered to
be hyponyms.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995758">
Applying the above steps, the binary tree rep-
resentation of concepts in the given domain is
used to construct the BRT tree for the taxonomy
construction. One example of the BRT tree is
shown in Figure 2 as below.

3 Concept Binary Tree Construction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999829333333333">
This study defines a set of concepts derived from
the Wikipedia category structure, a set of terms
in the WordNet hypernym sense, whyp, and a set
of terms in the WordNet hyponym, whypo, for a
given concept in the domain.1 For the set of terms
in the Wikipedia category, a syntax-based meth-
od is employed by referencing the research of
Tuan et al. (2014) to derive the taxonomy struc-
ture for the category terms. In our case of study,
is_a relationship is an identification of the hyper-
nym and hyponym relationship between terms in
the category set. That is, “X is_a Y” is translated
as “X is a hyponym of Y.” However, this only
shows a relationship among terms in the category
set. To identify the hypernym-hyponym relation-
ship between the domain concept and the terms
in the category, the study uses the semantic relat-
edness approach proposed in the research of Wu
et al. (2009). Finally, set operations are used to
collect hypernyms and hyponyms and we use
these features to construct a binary tree with the
domain concept as the root, if no category term is
a hypernym of domain concept. If there exists a
category term that is a hypernym of the domain
concept, the term becomes the root. For a given
concept in the domain, a set of hypernym, hyper,
and a set of hyponym, hypo are defined. After
deriving the category taxonomy, wt, for Wikipe-
dia categories, the following operations are de-
fined:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9994155">
hyper = whyper ∩ wt.hypernym (1)
hypo = whypo ∩ wt.hyponym (2)
</equation>
<page confidence="0.976846">
940
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998053125">
where wt.hypernym represents all hypernym
terms connected to the category taxonomy wt and
wt.hyponym represents all hyponym terms con-
nected to the category taxonomy wt.
The multiple binary trees are used to construct
BRT trees for the taxonomy extraction. However,
it is worth to note that a cascading binary tree can
be used instead of a BRT tree. For efficiency and
computational purposes, a BRT tree is used,
since a concept hypernym (parent node) can have
more than two hyponyms (child node). The ob-
jective is to find relatedness between root con-
cepts and the assigned parent node to the root
concept of the binary tree. Figure 3 shows an il-
lustration presenting concepts in our example
domain in Section 3.

To extract the hypernym-hyponym relation be-
tween concepts, our approach uses the taxonomy
de-scribed in Section 3. The concepts from the
given domain are replaced by their concept IDs
to distinguish them from the rest of the concepts
in the BRT tree. The root of the BRT tree is an
empty node, label entity. We use the Breath First
Traversal algorithm to extract concepts and their
corresponding hyponyms from the BRT tree.2

For a given concept in the BRT tree, we con-

In the table, the feature “vertices in coverage”
represent the ratio of number of vertices in com-
mon with the gold standard taxonomy to the
number of the gold standard vertices. The feature
“edge coverage” is the fraction of number of
edges in common with the gold standard over the
number of edges in the gold standard. The ration
of the product of the number of taxonomy edges
and the number of edges in common with the
gold standard to the number of gold standard
edges is represented by “Ratio of Novel edges” in
the result in Table 2.
From Table 2, it can be observed that, the sys-
tem has the best and the worst performance in
taxonomies for the science and equipment do-
mains respectively. The bases of these differ-
ences in the system’s performance are its
precision for individual domain against its gold
standard. For instance, from 452 vertices for the
gold standard science domain from the taxonomy
of fields and their subfields, the system was able
to extract 338 vertices. Furthermore, the system’s
cumulative measure of the similarity against the
gold standard is affected by the precision rate.
For instance, in the worst performance for the
gold standard domain of material handling
equipment combined with IS-A relations from
WiBi (Flati et al., 2014), our system has a preci-
sion of 1.61% as shown in the evaluation result5
while SC has good results in edge and vertex re-
trieval due to the good cumulative results.

sources of information. We first induce the con-
struction of binary tree structures for each term in
the domain using the extracted hypernym and
hyponym. From the set of binary trees, we at-
tempt to construct a BRT tree for the taxonomy
extraction.
We regard this work as initial, as there is
some improvement space to be made as well as
many related areas to look into. First, in any fu-
ture work we will investigate what better evalua-
tion framework we can propose for the system.
Second, we would like to give more attention to
optimize the system result to a more formalized
taxonomy. Third, we would like to include more
concepts of relatedness extraction to obtain the
stronger features.

The bases of these differences in the system’s performance are its precision for individual domain against its gold standard. For instance, from 452 vertices for the gold standard science domain from the taxonomy of fields and their subfields, the system was able to extract 338 vertices. Furthermore, the system’s cumulative measure of the similarity against the gold standard is affected by the precision rate. For instance, in the worst performance for the gold standard domain of material handling equipment combined with IS-A relations from WiBi (Flati et al., 2014), our system has a precision of 1.61% as shown in the evaluation result5 while SC has good results in edge and vertex retrieval due to the good cumulative results. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we present an approach for the unsupervised knowledge extraction for taxonomies 5 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/task17/index.php?id=evaluation of concepts using WordNet and Wikipedia as the sources of information.

Taxonomies specific to a domain are becoming indispensable to a growing number of applications (Velardi et al., 2013). Several stateof-the-art approaches already exist to extract taxonomies to characterize the domains of interest from the corpus using the information extraction techniques. Recently, attention has been devoted to inducing the taxonomy from a set of keyword phrases instead of from a text corpus (Liu et al., 2012). Such approaches enrich the set of keyword phrases by aggregating search results for each keyword phrase into a text corpus to overcome the lack of explicit relationships between keyword phrases from which the taxonomy can be induced. This approach faces a key challenge of extracting explicit relationships among keyword phrases. However, semantic relatedness between concepts in a domain is an important clue to extracting their taxonomy relationships. An important contribution in relation to this is reported by Gabrilovich et al. (2007) that present an explicit semantic analysis using the natu</context>

This approach faces a key challenge of extracting explicit relationships among keyword phrases. However, semantic relatedness between concepts in a domain is an important clue to extracting their taxonomy relationships. An important contribution in relation to this is reported by Gabrilovich et al. (2007) that present an explicit semantic analysis using the natural concepts and propose a uniform method of computing relatedness of both individual concept and arbitrarily long text fragments. Lexical databases such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) encode relations between words such as synonymy and hypernymy. Quite a few metrics have been defined that compute relatedness using various properties of the underlying graph structures of these resources. The obvious drawback of this approach is that the creation of lexical resources requires the lexicographic expertise as well as a lot of time and effort, and consequently such resources cover only a small fragment of the language lexicon. Specifically, such the resources contain few proper names, neologisms, slang, and domain-specific technical terms. Furthermore, these resources have stron</context>

Most state-of-the-art approaches for the domain-specific taxonomy induction use the text corpus as its input and some information extraction methods to extract ontological relationships from the text corpus, and finally apply the relationships to build the taxonomy. Other automatic approaches to taxonomy construction from texts include a statistical method to compare the syntactic context of terms for taxonomic relations identification (Tuan et al., 2014). There have been a number of handcrafted, well-structured taxonomies publicly available online, including WordNet (Miller, 1995). However, such taxonomies are also not perfect since human experts are liable to miss some relevant terms.
