Looking at the Proceedings of last year&apos;s Annual Meeting, one secs that the
session most closely paralleling this one was entitled Language Structure and
Parsing. In a very nice presentation, Martin Kay was able to unite the papers of
that session under a single theme. As he stated it,
There has been a shift of emphasis away from highly
structured systems of complex rules as the principal
repository of information about the syntax of a
language towards a view in which the responsibility
is distributed among the lexicon, semantic parts of
the linguistic description, and a cognitive or strategic
component. Concomitantly, interest has shifted
from algorithms for syntactic analysis and
generation. in which the central structure and the
exact sequence of events are paramount, to systems
in which a heavier burden is carried by the data
suucturc and in which the order of events is a meter
of strategy.
&apos;this year, the papers of the session represent a greater diversity of research
directions. The paper by Hayes. and the paper by Wilensky and Arens are both
examples of what Kay had in mind, but the paper by Church, with regard to the
question of algorithms, is quite the opposite. lie holds that once the full range
of constraints describing people&apos;s processing behavior has been captured, the
best parsing strategics will be rather straightforward, and easily explained as
algorithms.
Perhaps the seven papers in this year&apos;s session can best he introduced by briefly
citing some of the achievements and problems reported in the works they
reference.
In the late 1960&apos;s Woods (Woods701 capped an effort by several people to
develop NUN parsing. &apos;Ibis well known technique applies a straightforward top
down, left to right, depth first parsing algorithm to a syntactic grammar.
Especially in the compiled form produced by Burton Illurton764 the parser
was able to produce the first parse in good time, but without semantic
constraints, numerous syntactic analyses could be and sometimes were found,
especially in sentences with conjunctions. A strength of the system was the
A-IN grammar, which can be described as a set of context free production rules
whose right hand sides are finite state machines and whose transition arcs have
been augmented with functions able to read and set registers, and also able to
block a transition on their arc. Many people have found this a convenient
formulism in which to develop grammars of English.
The Woods ATN parser was a great success, and attempts were made to exploit
it (a) as a model of human processing and (b) as a tool for writing grammars. At
the same time it was recognized to have limitations. It wasn&apos;t tolerant of errors,
and it couldn&apos;t handle unknown words or constructions (there were many
syntactic constructions which it didn&apos;t know). In addition, the question
answering system fed by the parser had a weak notion of word and phrase
semantics and it was not always able to handle quantifiers properly. It is not
clear these components could have supported a stronger interaction with
syntactic parsing, had Woods chosen to attempt iL
On the success side. Kaplan [Kaplan72] was inspired to claim that the ATN
parser provided a good model for some aspects of human processing. Some
aspects which might be modeled are:

In one study, most people got the a) reading of 1). One can try to explain this

by ordering the arcs leaving the state where the head noun of an NP has been
accepted: a pop are (terminating the NP) is tried before an arc accepting a
modifying relative clause. However, Rich [Rich751 points out that this arc
ordering solution would seem to have difficulties with 2). This sentence is often

as requiring backup, yet if the arcs arc ordered as for 1), it does require backup.
There is no doubt that whatever is going on. the awareness of backup in 3) is so
much stronger than in 2) that it seems like a different phenomenon. To resolve
this,
3) The horse raced past the barn fell.
one could claim that perceived backup is some function of the length of the
actual backup, or maybe of the degree of commitment to the original path
(although it isn t clear what this would mean in ATN terms).
In this session, Ferrari and Stock will turn the arc ordering game around and
describe, for actual texts, the probability that a given are is the correct exit are
from a node, given the arc by which the parser arrived at the node. it will be
interesting to look at their distributions. In the speech project at IBM Watson
Laboratories [Baker751 it was discovered some time ago that, for a given text, the
syntactic class of a word could be predicted correctly over 90% of the time given
only the syntactic class of the preceding word. Interestingly, the correctness of
predictions fell off less than 10% when only the current word was used. One
wonders if this same level of skewness holds across texts, or (what we will hear)
for the continuation of phrases. These results should be helpful in discussing
the whole issue of arc ordering.
Implicit in any arc ordering strategy is the assumption that not all parses of a
sentence will be fund. Having the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; path, the parser will stop when it gets
an acceptable analysis. Arc ordering helps find that &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; path. Marcus
[Mareus78j, agreed with the idea of following only a best path, but he claimed
that the reason there is no perceived backup in 2) is that the human parser is
able to look ahead a few constituents instead of just one state and one
constituent in making a transition. He claims this makes a more accurate model
of human garden path behavior, but it doesn&apos;t address the issue of unlimited
stack depth. Here, Church will describe a parser similar in design to Marcus&apos;,
except that it conserves incmory. This allows Church to address psychological
facts not addressed by either Marcus or the ATN models. Church claims that
exploiting stack size constraints will increase the chances of building a good best
path parser.

Besides psychological modeling, there is also an interest in using the ATN
formalism for writing and teaching grammars. Paramount here is eJtplanation,
both of the grammar and its application to a particular sentence. The paper by
Kehler and Woods reports on this. Weischedel picks a particular problem,
responding to an input which the ATN can&apos;t handle. He aszociates a list of
diagnostic conditions and actions with each state. When no parse is found, the
parser finds the last state on the path which progressed the farthest through the
input string and executes its diagnostic conditions and actions. When a primer
uses only syntactic constraints, one expects it to find a lot of parses. Usually the
number of parses grows more than linearly with sentence length. Thus, for a
fairly complete grammar and moderate to long sentences, one would expect
that the case of no parses (handled by Weischedel) would be rare in comparison
with the other two cases (not handled) where the set of parses doesn&apos;t include
the correct one, or where the grammar has been mistakenly written to allow
undesired parses. Success of the above efforts to follow only the best path
would clearly be relevant here. No doubt Weischeders procedure can help find
a lot of bugs if the test examples are chosen with a little care. But there is still
interesting work to be done on grammar and parser explanation, and
Weischedel is one of those who intends to explore it.
The remaining three papers stem from three separate traditions which reject the
strict syntactic ATN fonnalism, each for its own reasons. They are:

Each of these systems claims some advantage over the more widely known and
accepted ATN.
The semantic grammar parser can be viewed as a variation of the AIN which
attempts to cope with the ATN&apos;s lack of semantics. Kaplan&apos;s work builds on
work started by Burton filurton761,1 and picked up by Hendrix et al
[I lendrix.781. The semantic grammar parser uses semantic in.acad of syntactic
arc categories. &apos;This collapses syntax and semantics into a single structure.
When an ATN parsing strategy is used the result is actually Igs_s flexible than a
syntactic ATN, but it is faster because syntactic possibilities are eliminated by
the semantics of the domain. &apos;The strategy is justified in terms of the
performance of actual running systems. Kaplan also calls on a speed criteria in
suggesting that when an unknown word is encountered the system assume all
possibilities which will let parsing proceed. Then if more than one possibility
leads to a successful parse, the system should attempt to resolve the word further
by file search or user query.
As Kaplan points out, this trick is not limited to semantic grammars, but only to
systems haying enough constraints. It would be interesting to know how we&amp;quot; it
would work for systems using Osherson&apos;s 10sherson78] predicability criterion.
instead of truth for their semantics. Osherson distinguishes between &amp;quot;green
idea&amp;quot;, which he says is silly and &amp;quot;married bachelor&amp;quot; which he says is just false.
Ile notes that &amp;quot;idea is not green&amp;quot; is no better, but &amp;quot;bachelor is not married&amp;quot; is
fine. Predicahility is a looser constraint than Kaplan uses, and if it would still be
enough to limit database search this we,. be interesi:ng, because predicability
is easier to implement across a broad domain,
lliilensky is a former suigent of Schanles and thus comes from a tradition which
emphasizes semantics over syntax. He is right in emphasizing the importance
of phrase semantics. The gthininarians Quirk and Greenbaum [Quirk731 point
out the syntactic .ind semantic importance of verb phrases over vcrbs.- In
linguistics. Bresnan Il3resnan801 is developing a theory of lexical phrases which
accounts, by lexical relations between constituents of a phrase, for many of the
phenomena explained by the old transformational grammar. For example,
given
4) There were reported to have been lions
sighted,
a typical ATN parser would attempt by register manipulations to make &amp;quot;lions&amp;quot;
the subject. Using a phrase approach, &amp;quot;there be lions sighted&amp;quot; can be taken as
meaning &amp;quot;exist lions sighted.&amp;quot; where &amp;quot;lions&amp;quot; is an object and &amp;quot;sighted&amp;quot; an object
complement &amp;quot;There is related to the &amp;quot;be&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;been&amp;quot; by a series of
relationships between the arguments of semantic structures. Wilensky appears
to have suppressed syntax into his semantic component, and so it will be
inteiesting to see how he handles the traditional syntactic phenomena of 4), like
passive and verb forms.
Finally, the paper by Hayes shows the influence of the speech recognition
projects where bad input gave the Woods ATN great difficulty. Text input is
much better than speech input. However, examination of actual input
(Malhotra75I docs show sentences like:

<bodyText confidence="0.991746583333334">
Fortunately, these cases are rare. Much more likely is clipsis and the omission
of syntax when the semantics are clear. For example, the missing commas in
6) Give ratios of manufacturing costs to sales
for plants I 2 3 and 4 for 72 and 73.
Examples like these show that errors and omissions arc not random phenomena
and that there can be something to the study of errors and how to deal with
them.
In summary, it can be seen that while much progress has been made in
constructing usable parsers, the basic issues, such as the division of syntax,
semantics, and pragmatics both in representation and in order of processing, are
still up for grabs. The problem has plenty of structure, so there is good fun to
be had.
