to form dynamic stereotype representations

ABSTRACT
Cognitive principles underlying the (re-)construc-
tion of word meaning and/or world knowledge struc-
tures are poorly understood yet. In a rather sharp
departure from more orthodox lines of introspective
acquisition of structural data on meaning and know-
ledge representation in cognitive science, an empi-
rical approach is explored that analyses natural
language data statistically, represents its numeri-
cal findings fuzzy-set theoretically, and inter-
prets its intermediate constructs (stereotype mean-
ing points) topologically as elements of semantic
space. As connotative meaning representations,
these elements allow an aspect-controlled, con-
tents-driven algorithm to operate which reorganizes
them dynamically in dispositional dependency struc-
tures (DDS-trees) which constitute a procedurally
defined meaning representation format.
0. Introduction
Modelling system structures of word meanings and/or
world knowledge is to face the problem of their
mutual and complex relatedness. As the cognitive
principles underlying these structures are poorly
understood yet, the work of psychologists, AI-re-
searchers, and linguists active in that field ap-
pears to be determined by the respective disci-
pline&apos;s general line of approach rather than by
consequences drawn from these approaches intersec-
ting results in their common field of interest. In
linguistic semantics, cognitive psychology, and
knowledge representation most of the necessary data
concerning lexical, semantic and/or external world
information is still provided introspectively. Re-
searchers are exploring (or make test-persons ex-
plore) their own linguistic/cognitive capacities
and memory structures to depict their findings (or
let hypotheses about them be tested) in various
representational formats (lists, arrays, trees,
nets, active networks, etc.). It is widely accepted
that these modelstructures do have a more or less
ad hoc character and tend to be confined to their
limited theoretical or operational performances
within a specified approach, subject domain or im-
plemented system. Basically interpretative approa-
ches like these, however, lack the most salient
characteristics of more constructive modelstruc-
tures that can be developed along the lines of an
entity-relationshlo approach (CHEN 1980). Their
properties of flexibility and dynamics are needed
for automatic meaning representation from input
texts to build up and/or modify the realm and scope
of their own knowledge, however baseline and vague
that may appear compared to human understanding.
In a rather sharp departure from those more ortho-
dox lines of introspective data acquisition in mea-
ning and knowledge representation research, the
present approach (1) has been based on the algo-
rithmic analysis of discourse that real speakers/
writers produce in actual situations of performed
or intended communication on a certain subject do-
main, and (2) the approach makes essential use of
the word-usage/entity-relationship paradigm in com-
bination with procedural means to map fuzzy word
meanings and their connotative interrelations in a
format of stereotypes. Their dynamic dependencies
(3) constitute semantic dispositions that render
only those conceptual interrelations accessible to
automatic processing which can - under differing
aspects differently - be considered relevant. Such
dispositional dependency structures (DDS) would
seem to be an operational prerequisite to and a
promising candidate for the simulation of contents-
driven (analogically-associative), instead of for-
mal (logically-deductive) inferences in semantic
processing.
1. The approach
The empirical analysis of discourse and the formal
representation of vague word meanings in natural
language texts as a system of interrelated concepts
(RIEGER 1980) is based on a WITTGENSTEINian assump-
tion according to which a great number of texts
analysed for any of the employed terms&apos; usage regu-
larities will reveal essential parts of the con-
cepts and hence the meanings conveyed.
It has been shown elsewhere (RIEGER 1980), that in
a sufficiently large sample of pragmatically homo-
geneous texts,called corpus, only a restricted vo-
cabulary, i.e. a limited number of lexical items
will be used by the interlocutors however compre-
hensive their personal vocabularies in general
might be. Consequently, the lexical items employed
to convey information on a certain subject domain
under consideration in the discourse concerned will
be distributed according to their conventionalized
communicative properties, constituting semiantic re-
gularities which may be detected empirically from
the texts.
For the quantitative analysis not of propositional
strings but of their elements, namely words in na-
tural language texts, rather simple statistics ser-
ve the basicalkly descriptive purpose. Developed
from and centred around a correlational measure to
specify intensities of co-occurring lexical items
used in natural language discourse, these analysing
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.989242961538462">
algorithms allow for the systematic modelling of a
fragment of the lexical structure constituted by
the vocabulary employed in the texts as part of the
concomitantly conveyed world knowledge.
A correlation coefficient appropriately modified
for the purpose has been used as a mapping function
(RIEGER 1981a). It allows to compute the relational
interdependency of any two lexical items from their
textual frequencies. Those items which co-occur
frequently in a number of texts will positively be
correlated and hence called affixed, those of which
only one (and not the other) frequently occurs in a
number of texts will negatively be correlated and
hence called repugnant. Different degrees of mord-
repugnancy and mord-affinity may thus be ascer-
tained without recurring to an investigator&apos;s or
his test-persons word and/or world knowledge (se-
mantic competence), but can instead solely be based
upon the usage regularities of lexical items obser-
ved in a corpus of pragmatically homogeneous texts,
spoken or written by real speakers/hearers in ac-
tual or intended acts of communication (communica-
tive performance).
2. The semantic space structure
Following a system-theoretic approach and taking
each word employed as a potential descriptor to
characterize any other word&apos;s virtual meaning, the
modified correlation coefficient can be used to map
each lexical item into fuzzy subsets (ZADEH 1981)
of the vocabulary according to its numerically spe-
cified usage regularities. Measuring the differen-
ces of any one&apos;s lexical item&apos;s usages, represented
as fuzzy subsets of the vocabulary, against those
of all others allows for a consecutive mapping of
items onto another abstract entity of the theoreti-
cal construct. These new operationally defined en-
tities - called an item&apos;s meanings - may verbally
be characterized as a function of all the diffe-
rences of all regularities any one item is used
with compared to any other item in the same corpus
of discourse.

The resulting system of sets of fuzzy subsets con-
stitutes the semantic space. As a distance-relatio-
nal datastructure of stereotypically formatted mea-
ning representations it may be interpreted topo-
logically as a hyperspace with a natural metric.
Its linguistically labelled elements represent mea-
ning points, and their mutual distances represent
meaning differences.
The position of a meaning point may be described by
its semantic environment. Tab.1 shows the topologi-
cal environment E&lt;UNTNEHM&gt;, 1.e. those adjacent
points being situated within the hypersphere of a
certain diameter around its center meaning point
UNTERNEHM/enterprise as computed from a corpus of
German newspaper texts comprising some 8000 tokens
of 360 types in 175 texts from the 1964 editions of
the daily DIE WELT.
Having checked a great number of environments, it
was ascertained that they do in fact assemble mea-
ning points of a certain semantic affinity. Further
investigation revealed (RIEGER 1983) that there are
regions of higher point density in the semantic
space, forming clouds and clusters. These were de-
tected by multivariate and cluster-analyzing me-
thods which showed, however, that the both, para-
digmatically and syntagmatically, related items
formed what may be named connotative clouds rather
than what is known to be called semantic fields.
Although its internal relations appeared to be un-
specifiable in terms of any logically deductive or
concept hierarchical system, their elements&apos; posi-
tions showed high degree of stable structures which
suggested a regular form of contents-dependant as-
sociative connectedness (RIEGER 1981b).
3. The dispositional dependency
Following a more semiotic understanding of meaning
constitution, the present semantic space model may
become part of a word meaning/world knowledge re-
presentation system which separates the format of a
basic (stereotype) meaning representation from its
latent (dependency) relational organization. Where-
as the former is a rather static, topologically
structured (associative) memory representing the
data that text analysing algorithms provide, the
latter can be characterized as a collection of dy-
namic and flexible structuring processes to re-
organize these data under various principles (RIE-
GER 1981b). Other than declarative knowledge that
can be represented in pre-defined semantic network
structures, meaning relations of lexical relevance
and semantic dispositions which are haevily depen-
dent on context and domain of knowledge concerned
will more adequately be defined procedurally. i.e.
by generative algorithms that induce them on chang-
ing data only and whenever necessary. This is
achieved by a recursively defined procedure that
produces hierarchies of meaning points, structured
under given aspects according to and in dependence
of their meanings&apos; relevancy (RIEGER 1984b).
Corroborating ideas expressed within the theories
spreading activation and the process of priming
studied in cognitive psychology (LORCH 1982), a new
algorithm has been developed which operates on the
semantic space data and generates - other than in
RIEGER (1982) - dispositional dependency structures
(DDS) in the format of n-ary trees. Given one mean-
ing point&apos;s position as a start, the algorithm of
least distances (LD) will first list all its neigh-
bouring points and stack them by increasing distan-
ces, second prime the starting point as head node
or root of the DDS-tree to be generated before,
third, the algorithm&apos;s generic procedure takes
over. It will take the first entry from the stack,
generate a list of its neighbours, determine from
it the least distant one that has already been
primed, and identify it as the ancestor-node to

whicn the new point is linked as descendant-node to
be primed next. Repeated succesively for each of
the meaning points stacked and in turn primed in
accordance with this procedure, the algorithm will
select a particular fragment of the relational
structure,, latently inherent in the semantic space
data and depending on the aspect, i.e. the initial-
ly primed meaning point the algorithm is started
with. Working its way through and consuming all
labeled points in the space structure - unless
stopped under conditions of given target nodes,
number of nodes to be processed, or threshold of
maximum distance - the algorithm transforms pre-
vailing similarities of meanings as represented by
adjacent points to establish a binary, non-symme-
tric, and transitive relation of seaantic relevance
between them. This relation allows for the hierar-
chical re-organization of meaning points as nodes
under a primed head in an n-ary DDS-tree (RIEGER
19B4a).
Without introducing the algorithms formally, some
of their operative characteristics can well be il-
lustrated in the sequel by a few simplified examp-
les. Beginning with the schema of a distance-like
data structure as shown in the two-dimensional con-
figuration of 11 points, labeled a to k (Fig. 1.1)
the stimulation of e.g. points a or c will start
the procedure and produce two specific selections
of distances activated among these 11 points (Fig.
1.2). The order of how these particular distances
are selected can be represented either by step-
lists (Fig. 1.3), or n-ary tree-structures (Fig.
1.4), or their binary transformations (Fig. 1.5).
It is apparent that stimulation of other points
within the same configuration of basic data points
will result in similar but nevertheless differing
trees, depending on the aspect under which the
structure is accessed, i.e. the point initially
stimulated to start the algorithm with.
Applied to the semantic space data of 360 defined
meaning points calculated from the textcorpus of
the 1964 editions of the German newspaper DIE MELT,
the 0i5positional Dependency Structure iDDS) of
UNTERNEHM/enterprise is given in Fig. 2 as gene-
rated by the procedure described.
Beside giving distances between nodes in the DOS-
tree, a numerical measure has been devised which
describes any node&apos;s degree of relevance according
to that tree structure. As a numerical measure, a
node&apos;s crzteriality is to be calculated with re-
spect to its root or aspect and has been defined as
a function of both, its distance values and its
level in the tree concerned. For a wide range of
purposes in processing DOS-trees, different crite-
rialities of nodes can be used to estimate which
paths are more likely being taken against others
being followed less likely under priming of certain
meaning points. Source-oriented, contents-driven
search and retrieval procedures may thus be perfor-
med effectively on the semantic space structure,
allowing for the activation of dependency paths.
These are to trace those intermediate nodes which
determine the associative transitions of any target
node under any specifiable aspect.
