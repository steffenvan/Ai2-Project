is presented. It is emphasized that rules
expressing constraints on single linguistic
structures and rules for selecting the most
preferable readings are completely different in
nature, and that rules for selecting preferale
readings should be utilized in analysis grammars of
practical MT systems. It is also claimed that
procedural control is essential in integrating such
rules into a unified grammar. Some sample rules
are given to make the points of discussion clear

The Mu-Project is a Japanese national project
supported by grants from the Special Coordination
Funds for Promoting Science &amp; Technology of
STA(Science and Technology Agency), which aims to
develop Japanese-English and English-Japanese
machine translation systems. We currently restrict
the domain of translation to abstracts of
scientific and technological papers. The systems
are based on the transfer approach[1], and consist
of three phases: analysis, transfer and generation.
In this paper, we focus on the analysis grammar of
Japanese in the Japanese-English system. The
grammar has been developed by using GRADE which is
a programming language specially designed for this
project[2]. The grammar now consists of about 900
GRADE rules. The experiments so far show that the
grammar works very well and is comprehensive enough
to treat various linguistic phenomena in abstracts.
In this paper we will discuss some of the basic
design principles of the grammar together with its
detailed construction. Some examples of grammar
rules and analysis results will be shown to make
the points of our discussion clear and concrete.

2. Procedural Grammar
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998055583333333">
There has been a prominent tendency in recent
computational linguistics to re-evaluate CFG and
use it directly or augment it to analyze
sentences[3.4.5]. In these systems(frameworks).
CFG rules independently describe constraints on
single linguistic structures, and a universal rule
application mechanism automatically produces a set
of possible structures which satisfy the given
constraints. It is well-known, however, that such
sets of possible structures often become
unmanageably large.
Because two separate rules such as

are usually prepared in CFG grammars in order to
analyze noun and verb phrases modified by
prepositional phrases. CFG grammars provide two

She was given flowers by her uncle.
Furthermore, the ambiguity of the sentence is
doubled by the lexical ambiguity of &amp;quot;by&amp;quot;, which can
be read as either a locative or an agentive
preposition. Since the two syntactic structures
are recognized by completely independent rules and
the semantic interpretations of &amp;quot;by&amp;quot; are given by
independent processes in the later stages.it is
difficult to compare these four readings during the
analysis to give a preference to one of these four
readings.
A rule such as
&amp;quot;If a sentence is passive and there is a
&amp;quot;by&amp;quot;-prepositional phrase, it is often the case
that the prepositional phrase fills the deep
agentive case. (try this analysis first)&amp;quot;
seems reasonable and quite useful for choosing the
most preferable interpretation, but it cannot be
expressed by refining the ordinary CFG rules. This
kind of rule is quite different in nature from a
CFG rule. It is not a rule of constraint on a
single linguistic structure(in fact, the above four
readings are all linguistically possible), but it
is a &amp;quot;heuristic&amp;quot; rule concerned with preference of
readings, which compares several alternative
analysis paths and chooses the most feasible one.

such preference rules based on various sorts of cue
such as morphological forms of words, collocations
of words, text styles, word semantics. etc. These
heuristic rules are quite useful not only for
increasing efficiency but also for preventing
proliferation of analysis results. As Wilks[6]
pointed out, we cannot use semantic information as
constraints on single linguistic structures, but
just as preference cues to choose the most feasible
interpretations among linguistically possible
interpretations. We claim that many sorts of
preference cues other than semantic ones exist in
real texts which cannot be captured by CFG rules.
We will show in this paper that, by utilizing
various sorts of preference cues, our analysis
grammar of Japanese can work almost
deterministically to give the most preferable
interpretation as the first output, without any
extensive semantic processing (note that even
&amp;quot;semantic&amp;quot; processing cannot disambiguate the above
sentence. The four readings are semantically
possible. It requires deep understanding of
contexts or situations, which we cannot expect in a
practical MT system).
In order to integrate heuristic rules based on
various levels of cues into a unified analysis
grammar, we have developed a programming langauage.
GRADE. GRADE provides us with the following
facilities.
- Explicit Control of Rule Applications :
Heuristic rules can be ordered according to their
strength(See 4-2).
- Multiple Relation Representation : Various
levels of information including morphological,
syntactic, semantic, logical etc. are expressed in
a single annotated tree and can be manipulated at
any time during the analysis. This is required not
only because many heuristic rules are based on
heterogeneous levels of cues, but also because the
analysis grammar should perform semantic/logical
interpretation of sentences at the same time and
the rules for these phases should be written in the
same framework as syntactic analysis rules (See
4-2. 4-4).
- Lexicon Driven Processing : We can write
heuristic rules specific to a single or a limited
number of words such as rules concerned with
collocations among words. These rules are strong
in the sense that they almost always succeed. They
are stored in the lexicon and invoked at
appropriate times during the analysis without
decreasing efficiency (See 4-1).
- Explicit Definition of Analysis Strategies :
The whole analysis phase can be divided into steps.
This makes the whole grammar efficient, natural and
easy to read. Furthermore, strategic consideration
plays an essential role in preventing undesirable
interpretations from being generated (See 4-3).

3 Organization of Grammar
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99961575">
In this section. we will give the organization
of the grammar necessary for understanding the
discussion in the following sections. The main
components of the grammar are as follows.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999363272727273">
(1) Post-Morphological Analysis
(2) Determination of Scopes
(3) Analysis of Simple Noun Phrases
(4) Analysis of Simple Sentences
(5) Analysis of Embedded Sentences (Relative
Clauses)
(6) Analysis of Relationships of Sentences
(7) Analysis of Outer Cases
(8) Contextual Processing (Processing of Omitted
case elements, Interpretation of &apos;Ha&apos; . etc.)
(9) Reduction of Structures for Transfer Phase
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997162692307692">
Each component consists of from 80 to 120
GRADE rules.
47 morpho-syntactic categories are provided
for Japanese analysis, each of which has its own
lexical description format. 12.000 lexical entries
have already been prepared according to the
formats. In this classification. Japanese nouns
are categorized into 8 sub-classes according to
their morpho-syntactic behaviour. and 53 semantic
markers are used to characterize their semantic
behaviour. Each verb has a set of case frame
descriptions (CFD) which correspond to different
usages of the verb. A CFD gives mapping rules
between surface case markers (SCM - postpositional
case particles are used as SCM&apos;s in Japanese) and
their deep case interpretations (DCI - 33 deep
cases are used). DCI of an SCM often depends on
verbs so that the mapping rules are given to CFO&apos;s
of individual verbs. A CFD also gives a normal
collocation between the verb and
SCM&apos;s(postpositonal case particles). Detailed
lexical descriptions are given and discussed in
another paper[7].
The analysis results are dependency trees
which show the semantic relationships among input
words.

<bodyText confidence="0.999940333333333">

</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.748586">
(4) Type 4 : Partial Apposition
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998235285714286">
The antecedent and the clause are related by
certain semantic/pragmatic relationships. The
relative clause of this type doesn&apos;t have any gaps.
This type cannot be translated directly into
English relative clauses. We have to interpolate
in English appropriate phrases or clauses which are
implicit in Japanese, in order to express the
semantic/pragmatic relationships between the
antecedents and relative clauses explicitly. In
other words, gaps exist in the interpolated phrases
or clauses.
Because the above four types of relative
clauses have the same surface forms in Japanese
(verb ) (noun).

<bodyText confidence="0.999932266666667">
careful processing is required to distinguish them
(note that the &apos;antecedents&apos; -modified nouns- are
located after the relative clauses in Japanese). A
sophisticated analysis procedure has already been
developed, which fully utilizes various levels of
heuristic cues as follows.
(Rule 1) There are a limited number of nouns which
are often used as antecedents of Type 3 clauses.
(Rule 2) When nouns with certain semantic markers
appear in the relative clauses and those nouns are
followed by one of specific postpositional case
particles, there is a high possibility that the
relative clauses are Type 2. In the following
example, the word &amp;quot;SHORISOKUDO&amp;quot;(processing speed)
has the semantic marker AO (attribute).

A set of lexical rules is defined for
&amp;quot;KEKKA&amp;quot;(result), which basically works as follows :
it examines first whether the deep object case has
already been filled by a noun phrase in the
relative clause. If so. the relative clause is
taken as type 4 and an appropriate phrase is
interpolated as in [ex-3]. If not, the relative
clause is taken as type 1 as in the following
example where the noun &amp;quot;KEKKA&amp;quot; (result) fills the
gap of object case in the relative clause.

<bodyText confidence="0.988458277777778">
The result which this experiment used
Such lexical rules are invoked at the beginning of
the relative clause analysis by a rule in the main
flow of processing. The noun &amp;quot;KEKKA&amp;quot; (result) is
given a mark as a lexical property which indicates
the noun has special rules to be invoked when it
appears as an antecedent of a relative clause. All
the nouns which require special treatments in the
relative clause analysis are given the same marker.
The rule in the main flow only checks this mark and
invokes the lexical rules defined in the lexicon.
(Rule 5) Only the cases marked by postpositional
case particles &apos;GA&apos;. &apos;WO&apos; and &apos;NI&apos; can be deleted
in Type 1 relative clauses, when the antecedents
are ordinary nouns. Gaps in Type 1 relative clauses
can have other surface case marks, only when the
antecedents are special nouns such as described in
Rule (3).

4-2 Conjuncted Noun Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95052154054054">
Conjuncted noun phrases often appear in
abstracts of scientific and technological papers.
It is important to analyze them correctly,
especially to determine scopes of conjunctions
correctly, because they often lead to proliferation
of analysis results. The particle &amp;quot;TO&amp;quot; plays
almost the same role as the English &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; to
conjunct noun phrases. There are several heuristic
rules based on various levels of information to
determine the scopes.
&lt;Scope Decision Rules of Conjuncted Noun Phrases
by Particle &apos;TO&apos;&gt;.
(Rule 1) Since particle &amp;quot;TO&amp;quot; is also used as a case
particle, if it appears in the position:
Noun &apos;TO&apos; verb Noun.
Noun &apos;TO&apos; adjective Noun,
there are two possible interpretations. one in
which &amp;quot;TO&amp;quot; is a case particle and &apos;noun TO
adjective(verb)&apos; forms a relative clause that
modifies the second noun, and the other one in
which &amp;quot;TO&amp;quot; is a conjunctive particle to form a
conjuncted noun phrase. However, it is very likely
that the particle &apos;TO&apos; is not a conjunctive
particle but a post-positional case particle, if
the adjective (verb) is one of adjectives (verbs)
which require case elements with surface case mark
&apos;TO&apos; and there are no extra words between &amp;quot;TO&amp;quot; and
the adjective (verb). In the following example.
&amp;quot;KOTONARU(to be different)&amp;quot; is an adjective which
is often collocated with a noun phrase followed by
case particle &amp;quot;TO&amp;quot;.

is almost always Noun-2. The second &apos;TO&apos; plays a
role of a delimiter which delimits the right
boundary of the conjunction. This &apos;TO&apos; is
optional, but in real texts one often places it to
make the scope unambiguous. especially when the
second conjunct is a long noun phrase and the scope
is highly ambiguous without it. Because the second
&apos;TO&apos; can be interpreted as a case particle (not as
a delimiter of the conjunction) and &apos;NO&apos; following
a case particle turns the preceding phrase to a

the relative clause modifies both conjuncts. that
is, the antecedent of the relative clause is the
whole conjuncted phrase.
These heuristic rules are based on different
levels of information (some are based on surface
lexical items, some are based on morphemes of
words, some on semantic information) and may lead
to different decisions about scopes. However, we
can distinguish strong heuristic rules (i.e. rules
which almost always give correct scopes when they
are applied) from others. In fact, there exists
some ordering of heuristic rules according to their
strength. Rules (1). (2), (3), (4) and (8), for
example, almost always succeed, and rules like (7)
and (8) often lead to wrong decisions. Rules like
(7) and (8) should be treated as default rules
which are applied only when the other stronger
rules cannot decide the scopes. We can define in
GRADE an arbitrary ordering of rule applications.
This capability of controlling the sequences of
rule applications is essential in integrating
heuristic rules based on heterogeneous levels of
information into a unified set of rules.
This ambiguity together with genuine ambiguities in
scopes of conjuncted noun phrases in 4-2 produces
combinatorial interpretations in CFG grammars. most
of which are linguistically possible but
practically unthinkable. It is not only
inefficient but also almost impossible to compare
such an enormous number of linguistically possible
structures after they have been generated. In our
analysis grammar. a set of scope decision rules are
applied in the early stages of processing in order
to block the generation of combinatorial
interpretations. In fact, the structure (2) in
which a relative clause exists within the scope of
a conjuncted noun phrase is relatively rare in real
texts, especially when the relative clause is
rather long. Such constructions with long relative
clauses are a kind of garden path sentence.
Therefore, unless strong heuristic rules like (2).
(3) and (4) in 4-2 suggest the structure (2). the
structure (1) is adopted as the first choice (Note
that, in [ex-7] in 4-2, the strong heuristic
rule[rule (3)] suggests the structure (2)). Since

the result of such a decision is explicitly
expressed in the tree:
&lt;sequence-of-words&gt;
and the grammar rules in the later stages of
processing work on this structure, the other
interpretations of scopes will not be tried unless
the first choice fails at a later stage for some
reason or alternative interpretations are
explicitly requested by a human operator. Note
that a structure like
which is linguistically possible but extremely rare
in real texts, is naturally blocked.

Analysis Grammar of Japanese in the Mu-project
is discussed in this paper. By integrating various
levels of heuristic information, the grammar can
work very efficiently to produce the most natural
and preferable reading as the first output result.
without any extensive semantic processings.
The concept of procedural grammars was
originally proposed by Winograd[9] and
Independently persued by other research groups[10].
However, their claims have not been well
appreciated by other researchers (or even by
themselves). One often argues against procedural
grammars, saying that: the linguistic facts
Winograd&apos;s grammar captures can also be expressed
by ATN, and the expressive power of ATN is
equivalent with that of the augmented CFG.
Therefore, procedural grammars have no advantages
over the augmented CFG. They just make the whole
grammars complicated and hard to maintain.
The above argument, however, misses an
important point and confuses procedural grammar
with the representation of grammars in the form of
programs (as shown in Winograd[9]). We showed in
this paper that: the rules which give structural
constraints on final analysis results and the rules
which choose the most preferable linguistic
structures (or the rules which block &amp;quot;garden path&amp;quot;
structures) are different in nature. In order to
Integrate the latter type of rules in a unified
analysis grammar. it is essential to control the
sequence of rule applications explicitly and
introduce strategic knowledge into grammar
organizations. Furthermore, introduction of
control specifications doesn&apos;t necessarily lead to
the grammar in the form of programs. Our grammar
writing system GRADE allows us a rule based
specification of grammar. and the grammar developed
by using GRADE is easy to maintain.
We also discuss the usefulness of lexicon
driven processing in treating idiosyncratic
phenomena in natural languages. Lexicon driven
prcessing is extremely useful in the transfer phase
of machine translation systems, because the
transfer of lexical items (selection of appropriate
target lexical items) is highly dependent on each
lexical item[11].
The current version of our analysis grammar works
quite well on 1,000 sample sentences in real
abstracts without any pre-editing.

Introduction The Mu-Project is a Japanese national project supported by grants from the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science &amp; Technology of STA(Science and Technology Agency), which aims to develop Japanese-English and English-Japanese machine translation systems. We currently restrict the domain of translation to abstracts of scientific and technological papers. The systems are based on the transfer approach[1], and consist of three phases: analysis, transfer and generation. In this paper, we focus on the analysis grammar of Japanese in the Japanese-English system. The grammar has been developed by using GRADE which is a programming language specially designed for this project[2]. The grammar now consists of about 900 GRADE rules.
