This paper describes a principled approach for
analyzing relations between constituent words
of compound nouns whose heads are deverbal
nouns. To develop an analyzer for the com-
pound nouns with deverbal heads is an essential
element of developing of a general compound
analyzer, as they constitute a major part of the
compound nouns. Our approach is based on the
classification of deverbal nouns by their lexical
conceptual structure (LCS) and the classifica-
tion of nouns in general (to appear in the mod-
ifier position) vis-à-vis a few core LCS types (of
head deverbal nouns). The experimental eval-
uation based on compound nouns with dever-
bal heads showed that over 99% of the com-
pounds were accurately analyzed. The result of
the experiment indicates that our approach is
very promising.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996978203703704">
This paper proposes a principled approach to
analyzing Japanese compound nouns whose
heads are deverbal nouns (henceforth deverbal
compounds for succinctness), using the frame-
work of lexical conceptual structure (LCS).
Deverbal compounds constitute a major part
of Japanese compound nouns, especially in
technical terms where noun compounds are
abundant, and to develop a method to deal with
deverbal compounds is an essential element of
developing a full-scale, high-performance com-
pound noun analyzer. We focus on compounds
with only two constituent words, as more com-
plex compounds are basically constructed by
the iteration of binary rules (Kageyama, 1999).
1 For instance, the ratio of technical terms that con-
tains deverbal nouns is 78% in a dictionary of informa-
tion processing (Aiso, 1993)
Deverbal nouns may behave as verbs, assign-
ing thematic roles to the other noun constituent
in a compound, or they may behave as nouns ac-
cepting a thematic role or modifying the other
constituent. On this account, the relation be-
tween constituent words in a deverbal com-
pound may be modification or adjunct relation
(when the deverbal head functions as an ordi-
nary noun), or it may be thematic role or inter-
nal argument relation (when the deverbal head
takes a verbal role). Though there are various
kinds of semantic relations that should be iden-
tified in compound nouns, the disambiguation of
modification and internal argument is the first
and essential element in compound noun analy-
sis.
For the analysis of deverbal compounds, we
propose a method based on LCS (Jackendoff,
1990; Kageyama, 1996). We will show that, by
adopting LCS-based approach, it is possible to
disambiguate the relation between constituent
words in deverbal compounds with high accu-
racy. As LCS gives a clear framework for de-
scribing verb semantics, the lexicon of dever-
bal nouns can be constructed consistently and
is thus extendable to a large scale, which is an-
other advantage of the LCS-based method.
In the following, after briefly discussing the
background and the overall framework of the
approach, we sketch the basic idea of using LCS
for the analysis of deverbal compounds. We will
then elaborate our LCS system (TLCS) in sec-
tion 4, noun classification in section 5, and pro-
cedure of analysis in section 6. In section 7, we
will show the result of experimental evaluation,
which is highly promising.

2 Background
2.1 Previous work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999728217391304">
The existing work on compound noun analyses
takes either the statistical approach or the se-
mantic approach. The former is more concerned
with contextual aspects of compounding, while
the latter with lexical aspects.
Lauer (1995) and Kobayasi et al. (1994) used
corpus-based statistical techniques for bracket-
ing compound nouns. Barker and Szpakowicz
(1998) proposed a semi-automatic approach to
analyzing and relations between constituents in
nouns phrases. Statistical techniques are useful
for broad-coverage shallow analysis when train-
ing methods are available.
On the other hand, semantic approaches ex-
plore types of relations between constituents in
compounds (Levi, 1978; Isabelle, 1984). Iida
et al. (1984) applied semantic framework of
(Levi, 1978) and (Isabelle, 1984) to the analy-
sis of English compounds. Semantic approaches
are important for the deeper analysis, but the
construction of the necessary lexicon tends to
be too much dependent on a particular system
and the lexicon is not easily extendable.

2.2 The basic design of our compound
analyzer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997205">
In this paper we try to establish a semantic
framework of the analysis of compound nouns
without depending on particular applications or
specific domain knowledge. It is because the for-
mation of compound nouns mainly depends on
lexical nature of their constituent words.
In semantic approach, it is important to clar-
ify what kind of lexical nature is relevant to
what kind of phenomena (i.e. relations) in
what type of compound nouns, and to develop a
framework and method of defining and describ-
ing the necessary semantic information consis-
tently. The semantic framework should be clear
enough so that the required lexicon can be ex-
tendable consistently to a very large size. The
work reported in this paper, i.e. an LCS-based
approach for deverbal compound analysis, con-
stitutes a core of this overall framework.

3 Basic Framework: Compound
Noun Analysis and TLCS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967818653846154">
Recent studies in linguistics (Hale and Keyser,
1990; Rappaport and Levin, 1988; Jackendoff,
1990; Levin and Hovav, 1995; Kageyama, 1996;
Sugioka, 1997; Sugioka, 2000) have shown that
the semantic decomposition based on the LCS
framework can systematically explain the word
formation as well as the syntax structure. How-
ever existing LCS frameworks can not be ap-
plied to the analysis of compounds straight-
forwardly because they do not give restriction
rules nor extensive semantic predicates for LCS.
Therefore we construct an original LCS, called
TLCS2, based on the LCS framework with a
clear set of LCS types and basic predicates. We
use the acronym &amp;quot;TLCS&amp;quot; to avoid the confu-
sion with other LCS-based schemes or with the
general idea of LCS.
In this section we will briefly sketch how
the expanded categories for nouns and dever-
bal nouns based on the TLCS framework can
be used in disambiguating the intra-compound
relations in deverbal compounds. Our frame-
work, as having a formal structure and proce-
dural restrictions, also has an advantage that
the consistency of describing lexical meanings
can be maintained.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999933">
3.1 Argument structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94092492">
The approach, using TLCS, is based on argu-
ment structure (Grimshaw, 1990). Argument
structure is a simple semantic structure for a
verb to express thematic role delivered to nouns
which are arguments. There are two types ar-
guments, i.e. external argument (`Agent&apos;) and
internal argument (`Theme&apos; and &apos;Goal&apos;) 3. For
example, we describe the argument structure of
a Japanese deverbal sousa&apos; (operate) as follows:
sousa (operate): (Agent ( Theme )).
Agent is the operator and Theme is the object
that is operated. (.) denotes an internal argu-
ment.
In deverbal compounds, it is only the internal
arguments that can take a predicate-argument
relation (Kageyama (1996)); elements of ex-
ternal arguments cannot establish a predicate-
argument relation in deverbal compounds. This
restriction is essential in disambiguating rela-
tions between constituent words in deverbal
compounds.

3 In this paper, we limit the types of thematic role to
three, i.e. Agent, Theme and Goal.

3.2 Relation between a noun and a
deverbal noun
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997123733333333">
As mentioned, the relations between the words
in Japanese deverbal compounds can be divided
into two: (i) the modifier becomes an inter-
nal argument of the deverbal head, and (ii) the
modifier functions as an adjunct. The disam-
biguation of these two relations is an essential
element in compound noun analysis&apos;
Take, for example, the following two
compounds5.
kikai -sousa kikai -hon&apos;yaku
machine -operate machine -translate
(machine operation) (machine translation)
The modifier kikai&apos; is the internal argument of
the deverbal head in the former, while it is the
adjunct in the latter.

3.3 Compound noun analysis using
TLCS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991125">
We assume that the relation can be determined
by the combination of the TLCS on the side of
deverbal heads and the consistent categoriza-
tion of modifier nouns on the basis of their be-
havior vis-d-vis a few canonical TLCS types (or
semantic predicates) of the deverbal heads. Fig-
ure 1 shows examples of disambiguating rela-
tions using the TLCS types of deverbal heads.

The first lexical information essential for the
compound analyzer is the LCS-based classifica-

Based on the existing work on LCS (Kageyama,
1996; Sugioka, 1997), we have established a
TLCS, i.e. a set of original predicates and ba-
sic structure types that can describe the seman-
tic structure of deverbal nouns for the Japanese

deverbal nouns are also given as well in Table

In Table 1, as in Figure 1, words written in
capital letters (such as &apos;CONTROL&apos; and &apos;ACT&apos;)

TLCS 1 4, 8 and 9 represent different types
of transitive verb. TLCS 11 and 12 are the
types of intransitive verb. TLCS 5 represents
the ergative verb and, 6, 7 and 10 are unac-
cusative verbs.
The semantic predicates have combinatorial
restrictions, which can be described in BNF as
shown in Table 2 ((VERB) is the root, i.e. the

5 Categorization of Modifier Nouns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999695">
The second lexical information necessary for the
compound noun analyzer is the categorization
of nouns which are to be in the modifier posi-
tion of the deverbal compounds. The essential
underlying assumption is this: If, as claimed in
(Jackendoff, 1990; Kageyama, 1996), the LCS
(and TLCS) represents a linguistically proper
lexical information of verbs (including deverbal
nouns) and can contribute to explaining phe-
nomena related to the argument structure in

<footnote confidence="0.721048571428571">
7 For example, transitive case is kaigi-o shuuryou-suru
&apos;meeting-ACC end-do&apos; [end a meeting], and intransitive
case is kaigi-ga shuuryou-suru &apos;meeting-NOM end-do&apos; [a
meeting ends]. Here `ga&apos; and &apos;o&apos; designate case mark-
ers of nominative (NOM) and accusative (ACC), respec-
tively. This phenomenon also appears in English (ex.
&apos;break&apos;), which is called ergative (Kageyama, 1996).

a principled way, then, correspondingly, there
should be some general and principled cate-
gorization of nouns that also consistently con-
tribute to describing phenomena related to ar-
gument structure AND this categorization can
be defined vis-d-vis some basic components of
the LCS scheme in a generalized and consistent
manner, together with some general grammati-
cal characteristics. Below we explain the noun
categorization thus established, together with
the basic features of the categorization criteria.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5694415">
• Categorization by the accusativity of
modifiers
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.947001727272727">
In Japanese compounds, there is the mod-
ifier without its accusative. This is an ad-
jectival stem and it does not appear with
inflections. Therefore, the modifier is al-
ways the adjunct in the compounds. So we
introduce the distinction of -ACC&apos; (unac-
cusative) and LFACC&apos; (accusative).
For example, kimitsu&apos; (secrecy) and
`kioku&apos; (memory) are LFACC&apos;, and sougo&apos;
(mutual-ity) and kinou&apos; (inductiv-e/ity)
are -ACC&apos;.

• Categorization by the basic compo-
nents of TLCS
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.946754714285714">
The basic components that contribute to
the general categorization of nouns are
CON&apos;, &apos;CONTROL&apos;, x=y&apos; and &apos;BECOME
[y BE AT z]&apos;. They are used in construct-
ing TLCS types 1, 2, 5 and 6, respectively
(see Table 1).
In order to categorize nouns, we check
whether they appear in sentences as an ob-
ject of the verb whose TLCS has each of
these specific components.
If a noun does not appear as the object
of each component, the noun is catego-
rized as a negative category denoted by
`-&apos;. If it does, +&apos; is assigned. In Ta-
ble 4 and in the discussion below, the cat-
egories of CON&apos;, &apos;CONTROL&apos;, x=y&apos; and
&apos;BECOME [y BE AT z]&apos; are denoted as
CON&apos;, EC(external control)&apos;, IC(internal
control)&apos; and UA(unaccusative)&apos;. Below
are examples of modifier nouns categorized
as negative or positive in terms of each of
these TLCS components.
ON koshou&apos; (fault) and seinou&apos; (perfor-
mance) are +ON&apos;, and heikou&apos; (par-
allel) and rensa&apos; (chain) are c-ON&apos;.
EC &apos;imi&apos;(semantic) and kairo&apos; (circuit)
are +EC&apos;,and kikai&apos; (machine) and
`densou&apos; (transmission) are -EC&apos;.
IC fuka&apos; (load) and jisoku&apos; (flux) are
FIC&apos;, and kakusan&apos; (diffusion) and
`senkei&apos; (linearly) are c-IC&apos;.
UA jiki&apos; (magnetic) and joutai&apos; (state)
are &apos;+UA&apos;, and junjo&apos; (order) and
`heikou&apos; (parallel) are &apos;-UA&apos;.
6 Procedure of Compound Noun

The noun categories introduced in section 5 can
be used for disambiguating the intra-term rela-
tions in deverbal compounds with various dever-
bal heads that take different TLCS types. The

with respect to TLCS types is summarized in

TLCS types 10, 11, and 12 do not take
the internal argument relation in compounds8.
TLCS types 8 and 9 take the internal argument

Some TLCS types are formed into the groups
that correspond to modifier categories in Table
4. For example, TLCS 2,3 and 4 form the group
that corresponds to the modifier category -EC&apos;.
This means that TLCS types in the group are
regarded as the same nature from the view of
the relation to the modifier category.

The actual analysis proceeds as follows:
Step 1 If the TLCS of the deverbal head is 10,
11, or 12 in Table 1, then declare the re-
lation as adjunct and terminate. If not, go
to next.
Step 2 If the modifier has the category -ACC&apos;,
then declare the relation as adjunct and
terminate. If not, go to next.
Step 3 The analyzer determines the relation
from the interaction of lexical meanings be-
tween a deverbal head and a modifier noun.
In the case of c-ON&apos;, -EC&apos;,`-IC&apos; or
declare the relation as adjunct and termi-
nate. If not, go to next. It is the advantage
of our approach to realize such a disam-
biguation based on semantic restriction.
Step 4 Declare the relation as internal argu-
ment and terminate.
With these rules and categories of nouns,
we can analyze the relations between words
in compounds with deverbal heads. For ex-
ample, when the modifier kikai&apos; (machine) is
categorized as -EC&apos; but +ON&apos;, the modifier
in kikai-hon&apos;yaku (machine-translation) is an-
alyzed as adjunct (that means &apos;translation by
a machine&apos;), and the modifier in kikai-sousa
(machine-operation) is analyzed as internal ar-
gument (that means &apos;operation of a machine&apos;),
both correctly.

7.1 Experiments and Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966120041666667">
We applied the method to 1223 two-constituent
compound nouns with deverbal heads. 816 of
them are taken from a dictionary of technical
terms (Aiso, 1993), and 415 from news articles
in a newspaper (Nikkei newspaper). In the ex-
periment, we assumed that the compounds were
segmented.
According to the manual evaluation of the
experiment, 99.3% (1215 words) of the results
were correct. The performance is very high. Ta-
ble 5 shows the details of how the rules are ap-
plied to disambiguating the relations between
constituent words in the deverbal compounds.
All in all, it shows that 366 or about 30% of the
disambiguation is done in Step 3 above, by re-
ferring to the relation between TLCS categories
and the noun categories (while the single most
frequently used category of disambiguation is
`-ACC&apos; used in step 2). This means that the
method we proposed is highly important in dis-
ambiguating the intra-term relation of deverbal
compounds.

deviate from our assumptions (among the 1223

In the former case, the modifier is the internal
argument, while in the latter it is the adjunct.
The TLCS of the former deverbal head is the

however, the categorization of the both TLCS
types is the same according to the definition in
Table 4. We categorize these TLCS types into
the same group of combination rule because the
TLCS 2, 3 and 4 are a kind of causation type
in Table 4. At the moment, we do not take ac-
count of the difference between TLCS 2 and 3
with the negative predicate &apos;NOT&apos; because we
do not have enough evidence about this. Fur-
ther examination is needed to deal with cases of
this type.

and the consistent categorization of the modi-
fier nouns. Though the relations that can be
disambiguated by the current framework is lim-
ited, the performance by precision is very high.
As the method is based on the linguisti-
cally clear and well-motivated perspective, the
method is very promising for further extension
of token coverage of the same type of phenom-
ena as it will be easy to extend the lexicon while
keeping the consistency. In addition, though
not reported here, it will be possible, according
to our current examination, to extend the cover-
age of the types of relations to be disambiguated
with extensions of this framework.

<abstract confidence="0.999363263157895">This paper describes a principled approach for analyzing relations between constituent words of compound nouns whose heads are deverbal nouns. To develop an analyzer for the compound nouns with deverbal heads is an essential element of developing of a general compound analyzer, as they constitute a major part of the compound nouns. Our approach is based on the classification of deverbal nouns by their lexical conceptual structure (LCS) and the classification of nouns in general (to appear in the modifier position) vis-à-vis a few core LCS types (of head deverbal nouns). The experimental evaluation based on compound nouns with deverbal heads showed that over 99% of the compounds were accurately analyzed. The result of the experiment indicates that our approach is very promising.</abstract>

Deverbal compounds constitute a major part of Japanese compound nouns, especially in technical terms where noun compounds are abundant, and to develop a method to deal with deverbal compounds is an essential element of developing a full-scale, high-performance compound noun analyzer. We focus on compounds with only two constituent words, as more complex compounds are basically constructed by the iteration of binary rules (Kageyama, 1999). 1 For instance, the ratio of technical terms that contains deverbal nouns is 78% in a dictionary of information processing (Aiso, 1993) Deverbal nouns may behave as verbs, assigning thematic roles to the other noun constituent in a compound, or they may behave as nouns accepting a thematic role or modifying the other constituent. On this account, the relation between constituent words in a deverbal compound may be modification or adjunct relation (when the deverbal head functions as an ordinary noun), or it may be thematic role or internal argument relation (when the deverbal head takes a verbal role). Though there are various kinds of semantic relations that should be identified in compound nouns, the disambiguation of modif</context>

For example, when the modifier kikai&apos; (machine) is categorized as -EC&apos; but +ON&apos;, the modifier in kikai-hon&apos;yaku (machine-translation) is analyzed as adjunct (that means &apos;translation by a machine&apos;), and the modifier in kikai-sousa (machine-operation) is analyzed as internal argument (that means &apos;operation of a machine&apos;), both correctly. 7 Experimental Evaluation 7.1 Experiments and Results We applied the method to 1223 two-constituent compound nouns with deverbal heads. 816 of them are taken from a dictionary of technical terms (Aiso, 1993), and 415 from news articles in a newspaper (Nikkei newspaper). In the experiment, we assumed that the compounds were segmented. According to the manual evaluation of the experiment, 99.3% (1215 words) of the results were correct. The performance is very high. Table 5 shows the details of how the rules are applied to disambiguating the relations between constituent words in the deverbal compounds. All in all, it shows that 366 or about 30% of the disambiguation is done in Step 3 above, by referring to the relation between TLCS categories and the noun categories (while the single most frequentl</context>

In section 7, we will show the result of experimental evaluation, which is highly promising. 2 Background 2.1 Previous work The existing work on compound noun analyses takes either the statistical approach or the semantic approach. The former is more concerned with contextual aspects of compounding, while the latter with lexical aspects. Lauer (1995) and Kobayasi et al. (1994) used corpus-based statistical techniques for bracketing compound nouns. Barker and Szpakowicz (1998) proposed a semi-automatic approach to analyzing and relations between constituents in nouns phrases. Statistical techniques are useful for broad-coverage shallow analysis when training methods are available. On the other hand, semantic approaches explore types of relations between constituents in compounds (Levi, 1978; Isabelle, 1984). Iida et al. (1984) applied semantic framework of (Levi, 1978) and (Isabelle, 1984) to the analysis of English compounds.

We use the acronym &amp;quot;TLCS&amp;quot; to avoid the confusion with other LCS-based schemes or with the general idea of LCS. In this section we will briefly sketch how the expanded categories for nouns and deverbal nouns based on the TLCS framework can be used in disambiguating the intra-compound relations in deverbal compounds. Our framework, as having a formal structure and procedural restrictions, also has an advantage that the consistency of describing lexical meanings can be maintained. 3.1 Argument structure The approach, using TLCS, is based on argument structure (Grimshaw, 1990). Argument structure is a simple semantic structure for a verb to express thematic role delivered to nouns which are arguments. There are two types arguments, i.e. external argument (`Agent&apos;) and internal argument (`Theme&apos; and &apos;Goal&apos;) 3. For example, we describe the argument structure of a Japanese deverbal sousa&apos; (operate) as follows: sousa (operate): (Agent ( Theme )). Agent is the operator and Theme is the object that is operated. (.) denotes an internal argument. In deverbal compounds, it is only the internal arguments that can take a predicate-argument relation (Kageyama (1996)); elements</context>

The essential underlying assumption is this: If, as claimed in (Jackendoff, 1990; Kageyama, 1996), the LCS (and TLCS) represents a linguistically proper lexical information of verbs (including deverbal nouns) and can contribute to explaining phenomena related to the argument structure in 7 For example, transitive case is kaigi-o shuuryou-suru &apos;meeting-ACC end-do&apos; [end a meeting], and intransitive case is kaigi-ga shuuryou-suru &apos;meeting-NOM end-do&apos; [a meeting ends].

There are two types arguments, i.e. external argument (`Agent&apos;) and internal argument (`Theme&apos; and &apos;Goal&apos;) 3. For example, we describe the argument structure of a Japanese deverbal sousa&apos; (operate) as follows: sousa (operate): (Agent ( Theme )).

In TLCSes, the words written in capital letters are semantic predicates, &apos;x&apos; denotes the external argument, and &apos;y&apos; and &apos;z&apos; denote the internal arguments. We will elaborate how the disambiguation is done in the following three sections. 4 TLCS The first lexical information essential for the compound analyzer is the LCS-based classification scheme of deverbal nouns and the lexicon. Based on the existing work on LCS (Kageyama, 1996; Sugioka, 1997), we have established a TLCS, i.e. a set of original predicates and basic structure types that can describe the semantic structure of deverbal nouns for the Japanese compound noun analyzer.

The essential underlying assumption is this: If, as claimed in (Jackendoff, 1990; Kageyama, 1996), the LCS (and TLCS) represents a linguistically proper lexical information of verbs (including deverbal nouns) and can contribute to explaining phenomena related to the argument structure in 7 For example, transitive case is kaigi-o shuuryou-suru &apos;meeting-ACC end-do&apos; [end a meeting], and intransitive case is kaigi-ga shuuryou-suru &apos;meeting-NOM end-do&apos; [a meeting ends]. Here `ga&apos; and &apos;o&apos; designate case markers of nominative (NOM) and accusative (ACC), respectively.

Deverbal compounds constitute a major part of Japanese compound nouns, especially in technical terms where noun compounds are abundant, and to develop a method to deal with deverbal compounds is an essential element of developing a full-scale, high-performance compound noun analyzer. We focus on compounds with only two constituent words, as more complex compounds are basically constructed by the iteration of binary rules (Kageyama, 1999). 1 For instance, the ratio of technical terms that contains deverbal nouns is 78% in a dictionary of information processing (Aiso, 1993) Deverbal nouns may behave as verbs, assigning thematic roles to the other noun constituent in a compound, or they may behave as nouns accepting a thematic role or modifying the other constituent. On this account, the relation between constituent words in a deverbal compound may be modification or adjunct relation (when the deverbal head functions as an ordinary noun), or it may be thematic role or internal argument relation (when the deverbal head takes a ve</context>
