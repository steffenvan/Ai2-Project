<bodyText confidence="0.999275375">
In this paper, we show how to construct a
transfer dictionary automatically. Dictionary
construction, one of the most difficult tasks
in developing a machine translation system, is
expensive. To avoid this problem, we investi-
gate how we build a dictionary using existing
linguistic resources. Our algorithm can be ap-
plied to any language pairs, but for the present
we focus on building a Korean-to-Japanese
dictionary using English as a pivot. We
attempt three ways of automatic construction
to corroborate the effect of the directionality
of dictionaries. First, we introduce “one-time
look up”method using a Korean-to-English and
a Japanese-to-English dictionary. Second, we
show a method using “overlapping constraint”
with a Korean-to-English dictionary and an
English-to-Japanese dictionary. Third, we con-
sider another alternative method rarely used
for building a dictionary: an English-to-Korean
dictionary and English-to-Japanese dictionary.
We found that the first method is the most
effective and the best result can be obtained
from combining the three methods.

There are many ways of dictionary building.
For machine translation, a bilingual transfer
dictionary is a most important resource. An in-
teresting approach is the Papillon Project that
focuses on building a multilingual lexical data
base to construct large, detailed and principled
dictionaries (Boitet et al., 2002). The main
source of multilingual dictionaries is monolin-
gual dictionaries. Each monolingual dictionary
is connected to interlingual links. To make
this possible, we need many contributors, ex-

perts and the donated data. One of the stud-
ies related to the Papillon Project tried to link
the words using definitions between English and
French, but the method can be extended to
other language pairs (Lafourcade, 2002). Other
research that focuses on the automatic build-
ing of bilingual dictionaries include Tanaka and
Umemura (1994), Shirai and Yamamoto (2001),
Shirai et al. (2001), Bond et al. (2001), and
Paik et al. (2001).
Our main concern is automatically building
a bilingual dictionary, especially with different
combinations of dictionaries. None of the re-
search on building dictionaries seriously consid-
ers the characteristics of dictionaries. A dic-
tionary has a peculiar characteristic according
to its directionality. For example, we use a
Japanese-to-English (henceforth, JOE) dictio-
nary mainly used by Japanese often when they
write or speak in English. Naturally, in this sit-
uation, a Japanese person knows the meaning
of the Japanese word that s/he wants to trans-
late into English. Therefore, an explanation for
the word is not necessary, except for the words
whose concept is hard to translate with a single
word. Part-of-speech (henceforth POS) infor-
mation is also secondary for a Japanese person
when looking up the meaning of the correspond-
ing equivalent to the Japanese word.
On the other hand, an English-to-Japanese
(henceforth ECJ) dictionary is basically used
from a Japanese point of view to discover the
meaning of an English word, how it is used and
so on. Therefore, explanatory descriptions, ex-
ample sentences, and such grammatical infor-
mation as POS are all important. As shown in
(2), a long explanation is used to describe the
meaning of tango, its POS and such grammat-
ical information as singular or plural. Also, an
ECJ dictionary includes the word in plenty of
examples, comparing to a JE dictionary. The
following examples clearly show the difference.

2 Conventional Methods and
Problems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997416430232558">
The basic method of generating a bilingual
dictionary through an intermediate language
was proposed by Tanaka and Umemura
(1994). They automatically constructed a
Japanese-French dictionary with English as an
intermediate language and manually checked
the extracted results. In this sense, their
method is not completely automatic. They
looked up English translations for Japanese
words, and then French translations of these
English translations. Then, for each French
word, they looked up all of its English trans-
lations. After that, they counted the number
of shared English translations (one-time
inverse consultation). This was extended to
“two-time inverse consultation”. They looked
up all the Japanese translations of all the
English translations of a given French word
and counted how many times the Japanese
word appears. They reported that “comparing
the generated dictionary with published dic-
tionaries showed that data obtained are useful
for revising and supplementing the vocabulary
of existing dictionaries.” Their method shows
the basic method of building a dictionary using
English as an intermediate language. We ap-
plied and extended their method in automatic
dictionary building especially considering the
directionality of dictionaries.
Tanaka and Umemura (1994) used four dic-
tionaries in two directions (JE, EJ, FE
and EF). They first harmonized the dictio-
naries by combining the JE and EJ into
a single JE and the FE and EF into a
harmonized FE dictionary. We followed their
basic method without harmonizing the dictio-
naries to emphasize the influence of directional-
ity.
In general, foreign word entries in a bilingual
dictionary attempt to cover the entire vocabu-
lary of the foreign language. However, foreign
words that do not correspond to one’s mother
tongue are not recorded in a bilingual dictio-
nary from one’s mother tongue to the foreign
language (Hartmann, 1983). A long explana-
tory phrase is replaced with a word that often
does not perfectly correspond to the original.
On the other hand, most of the index words
from a foreign language to a mother tongue in-
clude many expository definitions or explana-
tions that focus on usage. Such syntactic infor-
mation as POS and number as well as exam-
ple sentences are rich compared with a dictio-
nary from mother tongue to a foreign language.
These characteristics should be considered when
building a dictionary automatically.
Bond et al. (2001) showed how semantic
classes can be used along with an intermediate
language to create a Japanese-to-Malay dictio-
nary. They used semantic classes to rank trans-
lation equivalents so that word pairs with com-
patible semantic classes are chosen automati-
cally as well as using English to link pairs. How-
ever, we cannot use this method for languages
with poor language resources, in this case se-
mantic ontology. Paik et al. (2001) improved
the method to generate a Korean-to-Japanese
(henceforth KJ) dictionary using multi-pivot
criterion. They showed that it is useful to build
dictionaries using appropriate multi-pivots. In
this case, English is the intermediate language
and shared Chinese characters between Korean
and Japanese are used as pivots.
However, none of the above methods con-
sidered the directionality of the dictionaries in
their experiments. We ran three experiments to
emphasize the effects of directionality.1 There
are many approaches to building a dictionary.
But our focus will be on the generality of build-
ing any pair of dictionaries automatically using
English as a pivot. In addition, we want to con-
firm various directionalities between a mother
tongue and a foreign language.
&apos;The first two experiments were reported in Shirai
and Yamamoto (2001) and Shirai et al. (2001). We
present new evaluations in this paper.

We introduce three ways of constructing a KBJ
dictionary. First, we construct a KBJ dic-
tionary using a KBE dictionary and a JBE.
Second, we show another way of constructing
a KBJ dictionary using an KBE dictionary
and an EBJ dictionary. Third, we use a novel
way of dictionary building using an EBK and
EBJ to build a KBJ dictionary. However, our
method is not limited to building a KBJ dic-
tionary but can be extended to any other lan-
guage pairs so long as X-to-English or English-
to-X dictionaries exist. These three methods
will cope with making dictionaries using any
combination.
We assume that the following conditions hold
when building a bilingual dictionary: (1) Both
the source language and the target language
cannot be understood (to build a dictionary
of unknown language pairs); (2) Various lex-
ical information of the intermediate language
(English) is accessible. (3) Limited information
about the source and target language may be
accessible.

Our method can be extended to any other
language pairs if there are X-to-English and
English-to-X dictionaries. It means that there
are four possible combinations such as i)
X-to-English and Y-to-English, ii) X-to-English
and English-to-Y, iii) English-to-X and Y-to-
English and iv) English-to-X and English-to-Y
to build a X-to-Y dictionary. We tested i), ii)
and iv) in this paper and we used the following
dictionaries in our experiment:

Our method is based upon a one-time in-
verse consultation of Tanaka and Umemura

respondences of Korean and Japanese.
Lexical Resources used here is a KBE dic-
tionary (50,826 entries) and a JBE dictionary

(28,310 entries). There is a big difference in the
number of entries between the two dictionaries.
This will affect the total number of extracted
words.
For Evaluation, we use a similarity score 51
for a Japanese word j and a Korean word k is
given in Equation (1), where E(w) is the set of
English translations of w. This is equivalent to
the Dice coefficient. The extracted word pairs
and the score are evaluated by a human to keep
the accuracy at approximately 90%.
The most successful case is when all the En-
glish words in the middle are shared by KBE
and JBE. Figure 1 shows how the link is real-
ized and the similarity scores are shown in Table
1. The similarity score shows how many English
words are shared by the two dictionaries: the
higher the score, the higher possibility of suc-
cessful linking. However, as Table 1 shows, we
have to sort out the inappropriately matched
pairs by comparing the 51 score of equation (1)
against a threshold T. The threshold allows us
to exclude unfavorable results. For example,
for words having one shared English translation
equivalent, we have to discard the group (3) in
Table 1.
When the words translated from English
match completely, the accuracy is high. And if
the number of shared English translated words
(|E(J) n E(K)|) is high, then we get a high
possibility of accurate matching of Korean and
Japanese. However, accuracy deteriorates when
the number of the shared English translated
words (shown by the threshold) decreases as
in (2) and (3) of Table 1. We solved this
problem by varying the threshold according
to the number of shared English equivalents.
The value of the threshold T was determined
experimentally to achieve an accuracy rate of
90%.
Result: Linking through English gives a to-
tal of 175,618 Korean-Japanese combinations.
To make these combinations, 28,479 entries out
of 50,826 from the KBE dictionary and 17,687
entries out of 28,310 from the JBE dictionary
are used. As a result, we can extract 25,703 es-
timated good matches with an accuracy of 90%.

Method: We investigated how to improve
the extraction rate of equivalent pairs using
an overlapping constraint method here.
To extract Korean-Japanese word pairs, we
searched consecutively through a KE dictio-
nary and then an EJ dictionary. We take
English sets corresponding to Korean words
from a Korean-English dictionary and Japanese
translation sets for each English words from an
EJ dictionary. The overlap similarity score
52 for a Japanese word j and a Korean word
k is given in Equation (2), where E(w) is the
set of English translations of w and J(E) is the
bag of Japanese translations of all translations
of E.

After that, we test the narrowing down of trans-
lation pairs by extracting the overlapped words
in the Japanese translation sets. See Figure 2.
Lexical Resources: We used a KE dictio-
nary (50,826 entries), the same as the one used
in section 3.2 and a EJ dictionary (52,369 en-
tries). Compared to the resources used in our
first method, the number of entries are well bal-
anced.
Evaluation: After extracting the over-
lapped words in the Japanese translation sets,
the words were evaluated by humans. The
main evaluation was to check the correlation
between the overlaps and the matches of
Korean and Japanese word pairs. Table 3
shows the overlapped number of shared English
words and the number of index words of the
KE dictionary.

nary. Unfortunately, this information cannot be
used effectively due to the lack of POS in KCE
when linking them to a ECK dictionary. On
the other hand, clean using ECJ can be trans-
lated into either , an adjective or
, a verb. This makes the range of over-
lap score widely distributed as shown in Figure
2. This is the reason using KCE and ECJ is
not as good as using KCE and JCE. We will
discuss this more in section 4.

3.4 Linking ECK and ECJ
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999703066666667">
As we have discussed in earlier sections, the
characteristics of dictionaries differ according to
their directionality. In this section, we intro-
duce a novel method of matching translation
equivalents of Korean and Japanese. From the
Korean speaker’s point of view, the ECK dic-
tionary covers all English words, includes ex-
planatory equivalents, and example sentences
showing usage. The same thing is true for the
ECJ dictionary from a Japanese speaker’s point
of view. In this respect, we expect that the
result of extraction is not as effective as the
other combinations such as KCE +JCE and
KCE +ECJ. On the other hand, we think that
there must be other ways to exploit explanatory
equivalents and example sentences.
Method: First, we linked all the Korean
and Japanese words if there is any shared En-
glish words. Then, we sorted them according to
POSs to avoid the polysemous problem of POS.
The left hand side of Figure 3 shows how we
link Korean and Japanese pairs.
Lexical Resources: We used a ECK dic-
tionary (84,758 entries) and a ECJ dictionary
(52,369 entries). Both of the dictionaries have
many more entries than the ones used in the
previous two methods.
Evaluation: We use similarity score 53 in
Equation (3) as a threshold which is used to
extract good matches.

|K(E) |means the number of Korean trans-
lation equivalents, and|J(E) |means the num-
ber of Japanese translation equivalents. The
sum of the numbers is divided by the number
of intermediate English words. It is used to re-
duce the polysemous problem of English words.
It is because it is hard to decide which trans-
lation is appropriate, if an English word has
too many translation equivalents in Korean and
Japanese. The value of threshold (53) is shown
in Table 4. We vary the threshold according
to N = |E(j) n E(k) |to maximize the number
of successful matches experimentally. N repre-
sents the number of intermediate English words.
For N=1, we only count one-to-one matches,
which means one Korean and one Japanese are
matched through only one English. The follow-
ing are examples of being counted when N is
1-to-1: e.g. -autosuggestion(n.)-
, ( ) -billiard(a.)- , etc. We may
lose many matching pairs by this threshold, but
the accuracy rate for 1-to-1 is very high (96.5%).
To save other matches when N=1, we need to
examine further. In our experiment, #&gt;
is rejected because lovely has two Korean
translations and two Japanese translations; the
match #&gt; is not 1-to-1. We post-
pone this part to further research.

Result: Table 4 shows the extracted 21,564

erage, 14,712 pairs match with a 68.3% suc-

mated.
As expected, by setting this threshold we get
fewer extracted words such as 10,360 words as
shown in Table 4. However, the accuracy of the
matched word pairs averages 92.7%.
Comparison: To compare the three meth-
ods, we randomly chose 100 Korean words from
a KCJ dictionary6 which could be matched
through all three methods. The number of
extracted matches was 28 using KCE and
JCE, 34 using KCE and ECJ, and 13 using
ECK and ECJ. For KCE and ECJ method,
21 out of 34 KCJ pairs were found only in
KCE and ECJ method but not in KCE and
JCE method. Among the 21 new KCJ word
pairs, only one pair is an error (not a good
match). One new pair was found in ECK and
ECJ method. Therefore, combining all three
methods gave 49 (28+20+1) different KCJ
pairs, a better result than any single method.

We have shown the results of different match-
ing metrics for different dictionary directions.
Directionality is an important matter for
building dictionaries automatically. In a KCE
(or JCE) dictionary an index word contains
non-conjugated forms whereas an index word
in ECK (or ECJ) dictionary contains POS
and conjugated forms. Therefore we expect the
combination of KCE and JCE to be better
than KCE and ECJ since we can avoid the
mismatch of POS.
On the other hand, a dictionary ECK or
ECJ contains less uniform information such
as long expository terms, grammatical explana-
tions and example sentences. Especially, POS
is far more detailed than the dictionaries of the
other direction. These all contribute to fewer
good matching words.
As for the better result using KE and JE,
we cannot overlook language similarity: Korean
and Japanese are very similar with respect to
their vocabularies and grammars. This must
have result in sharing relatively more appropri-
ate English translations and further matching
more appropriate Korean and Japanese trans-
lation equivalents.
In the combination of KE and EJ, the
common English translations are reduced due to
the characteristics of KE and EJ. A KE
dictionary from the Korean speaker’s point of
view tends to have relatively simple English
equivalents and normally POS is not shown. On
the other hand, an EJ dictionary shows such
complicated equivalents as explanation of the
entry a, a piece of translation equivalent b and
grammatical information as shown in (2) in Sec-
tion 1. Therefore, it is natural that the match-
ing rate is far less than the combination of KE
and JE. Considering the size of dictionaries
used in KE and JE (estimated maximum
matches: 28,310 KJ pairs) and the one used in
KE and EJ (estimated maximum matches:
50,826 KJ pairs), we extrapolate from Table 5
that the method using KE and JE is better
than the method using KE and EJ.
We concluded that: KE + JE outper-
forms KE + EJ which outperforms EK
+ EJ. The following briefly summarizes the
three methods.

– We can take advantage of example sentences,
expository terms, and explanations to extract
functional words.
– We can improve accuracy by including En-
glish POS data.
Even though we expected that the combina-
tion of dictionaries between EK and EJ will
not provide a good result, it is worthwhile to
know limits. After analyzing all of the result,
we found that there is the effect of dictionary
directionality. Also, we confirm that if we can
use all the methods and combine them, we will
get the best result since the output of the three
dictionary combinations do not completely over-
lap.
.
Only the root forms are registered in an X-to-
English dictionary. Also for verbs, we can get
non finite forms using EK and EJ dictionar-
ies. As index word, the non-conjugated forms
are registered in a JE dictionary such as
meaning beautiful or clean. However, by
using EJ, we can get conjugated forms such
as , and so forth. Registering
all conjugated forms in a dictionary simplifies
the development of a machine translation sys-
tem and further second language acquisition.
The direction from English-to-X contains a
lot of example sentences. So far, the idea of us-
ing example sentences and idiomatic phrases for
dictionary construction has not been adopted.
To check the possibility of extracting functional
words, we extracted example sentences and id-
iomatic phrases from EJ and EK dictionar-
ies based upon the number of shared English
words and look into the feasibility of using them
to extract functional words.
Future Work
Our goal is not restricted to making a Korean-
Japanese dictionary, but can be extended to any
language pair. We assume that we do not know
the source and target languages so well that it
is not easy to match just the content words. In-
stead, we need to match automatically any kind
of entries, even such functional words as parti-
cles, suffixes and prefixes. We think that it is
best to extract these functional words by tak-
ing advantage of the characteristics of the EK
and EJ dictionaries. For example, one of the
merits of using EK and EJ is that we can
get conjugated forms such as the Korean adjec-
tive which matches the English adjec-
tive beautiful; it is normally not registered in
a KE dictionary because is an ad-
jective conjugated form of the root
We extracted a total of 1,033 paraphrasing
sentence pairs between Korean and Japanese
with five or more shared English words. Among
them, 465 sentences (45%) matched all the En-
glish exactly (=), and 373 sentences (36.1%) al-
most () matched. We give examples below:
= (10) ”as for me, give me liberty or give me
death.”
.
”as for me, give me liberty or give me
death.”
(8) ”he is taller than any other boy in the
class.” .
”Tom is taller than any other boy in his
class.” .
(extracted from EK and EJ)
The numbers in parentheses in the above ex-
amples represent how many English words are
shared between EK and EJ. Using these
paraphrasing sentences we will examine the ef-
fective way of extracting functional words.
Finally we would like to apply our method to
open source dictionaries, in particular EDICT
(JE, Breen (1995)) and engdic (EK, Paik
and Bond (2003)). This would make the results
available to everyone, so that they can be used
in comparative evaluation or further research.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996708">
We have shown three major combination of dic-
tionaries to build dictionaries. These methods
can be applied to any pairs of language; we used
a KE dictionary, a JE, an EK dictionary
and an EJ to build a KJ dictionary using
English as a pivot.
We applied three different methods accord-
ing to different combination of dictionaries.
First, a one-time look up method (Tanaka and
Umemura, 1994) is tried using KE and JE.
Second, an overlapping constraint method in
one direction is applied using KE and EJ.
Finally, a novel combination for building a
dictionary is attempted using EK and EJ.
We found that the best result is obtained
by the first method. However, by combining
all methods we can extract far more entries
since the results from the three method do not
overlap. Our result shows that 60% of word
pairs in the second method are not found in the
first or the third method. For the third method
(using EK and EJ), we could not extract
as many matched pairs, but it is potentially
useful for extracting conjugated forms and
functional words.

<abstract confidence="0.99881752">In this paper, we show how to construct a transfer dictionary automatically. Dictionary construction, one of the most difficult tasks in developing a machine translation system, is expensive. To avoid this problem, we investigate how we build a dictionary using existing linguistic resources. Our algorithm can be applied to any language pairs, but for the present we focus on building a Korean-to-Japanese dictionary using English as a pivot. attempt three ways of automatic construction to corroborate the effect of the directionality of dictionaries. First, we introduce “one-time look up”method using a Korean-to-English and a Japanese-to-English dictionary. Second, we show a method using “overlapping constraint” with a Korean-to-English dictionary and an English-to-Japanese dictionary. Third, we consider another alternative method rarely used for building a dictionary: an English-to-Korean dictionary and English-to-Japanese dictionary. We found that the first method is the most effective and the best result can be obtained from combining the three methods.</abstract>

In general, foreign word entries in a bilingual dictionary attempt to cover the entire vocabulary of the foreign language. However, foreign words that do not correspond to one’s mother tongue are not recorded in a bilingual dictionary from one’s mother tongue to the foreign language (Hartmann, 1983). A long explanatory phrase is replaced with a word that often does not perfectly correspond to the original.

Second, we show another way of constructing a KBJ dictionary using an KBE dictionary and an EBJ dictionary. Third, we use a novel way of dictionary building using an EBK and EBJ to build a KBJ dictionary. However, our method is not limited to building a KBJ dictionary but can be extended to any other language pairs so long as X-to-English or Englishto-X dictionaries exist. These three methods will cope wit</context>

The main source of multilingual dictionaries is monolingual dictionaries. Each monolingual dictionary is connected to interlingual links. To make this possible, we need many contributors, ex* Some of this research was done while at ATR. perts and the donated data. One of the studies related to the Papillon Project tried to link the words using definitions between English and French, but the method can be extended to other language pairs (Lafourcade, 2002). Other research that focuses on the automatic building of bilingual dictionaries include Tanaka and Umemura (1994), Shirai and Yamamoto (2001), Shirai et al. (2001), Bond et al. (2001), and Paik et al. (2001). Our main concern is automatically building a bilingual dictionary, especially with different combinations of dictionaries. None of the research on building dictionaries seriously considers the characteristics of dictionaries. A dictionary has a peculiar characteristic according to its directionality. For example, we use a Japanese-to-English (henceforth, JOE) dictionary mainly used by Japanese often when they write or speak in English. Naturally, in this situation, a Japanese person knows the meanin</context>

The following examples clearly show the difference. (1) JOE: : dance the tango s (2) ECJ: tan go /(n. pl s) :a. ..etc. (trans. tango “a dance of Central African aboriginals .... etc.&amp;quot;)b. boriginals....etc.&amp;quot;)b. (trans. “its music”)Vi (“to dance the tango”). In this paper, we evaluate the effects that occur when we use different combinations of dictionaries and merge them in different ways. 2 Conventional Methods and Problems The basic method of generating a bilingual dictionary through an intermediate language was proposed by Tanaka and Umemura (1994). They automatically constructed a Japanese-French dictionary with English as an intermediate language and manually checked the extracted results. In this sense, their method is not completely automatic. They looked up English translations for Japanese words, and then French translations of these English translations. Then, for each French word, they looked up all of its English translations. After that, they counted the number of shared English translations (one-time inverse consultation). This was extended to “two-time inverse consultation”. They looked up all the Japanese translations of al</context>

It means that there are four possible combinations such as i) X-to-English and Y-to-English, ii) X-to-English and English-to-Y, iii) English-to-X and Y-toEnglish and iv) English-to-X and English-to-Y to build a X-to-Y dictionary. We tested i), ii) and iv) in this paper and we used the following dictionaries in our experiment: Type # Entries Dictionary JBE 28,310 New Anchor 2 EBJ 52,369 Super Anchor3 KBE 50,826 Yahoo KBE 4 EBK 84,758 Yahoo EBK 4 3.2 Linking KBE and JBE Our method is based upon a one-time inverse consultation of Tanaka and Umemura (1994)( See Section 2.) to judge the word correspondences of Korean and Japanese. Lexical Resources used here is a KBE dictionary (50,826 entries) and a JBE dictionary 2(Yamagishi et al., 1997) 3 (Yamagishi and Gunji, 1991) 4 http://kr.engdic.yahoo.com (28,310 entries). There is a big difference in the number of entries between the two dictionaries. This will affect the total number of extracted words. For Evaluation, we use a similarity score 51 for a Japanese word j and a Korean word k is given in Equation (1), where E(w) is the set of English translations of w. This is equivalent to the Dice coef</context>

This would make the results available to everyone, so that they can be used in comparative evaluation or further research. 5 Conclusion We have shown three major combination of dictionaries to build dictionaries. These methods can be applied to any pairs of language; we used a KE dictionary, a JE, an EK dictionary and an EJ to build a KJ dictionary using English as a pivot. We applied three different methods according to different combination of dictionaries. First, a one-time look up method (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994) is tried using KE and JE. Second, an overlapping constraint method in one direction is applied using KE and EJ. Finally, a novel combination for building a dictionary is attempted using EK and EJ. We found that the best result is obtained by the first method. However, by combining all methods we can extract far more entries since the results from the three method do not overlap. Our result shows that 60% of word pairs in the second method are not found in the first or the third method. For the third method (using EK and EJ), we could not extract as many matched pairs, but it is potent</context>
