Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999899190476191">
The goal of the Penn Discourse Treebank
(PDTB) project is to develop a large-scale cor-
pus, annotated with coherence relations marked
by discourse connectives. Currently, the primary
application of the PDTB annotation has been to
news articles. In this study, we tested whether
the PDTB guidelines can be adapted to a differ-
ent genre. We annotated discourse connectives
and their arguments in one 4,937-token full-text
biomedical article. Two linguist annotators
showed an agreement of 85% after simple con-
ventions were added. For the remaining 15%
cases, we found that biomedical domain-specific
knowledge is needed to capture the linguistic
cues that can be used to resolve inter-annotator
disagreement. We found that the two annotators
were able to reach an agreement after discussion.
Thus our experiments suggest that the PDTB an-
notation can be adapted to new domains by mini-
mally adjusting the guidelines and by adding
some further domain-specific linguistic cues.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997361875">
Large scale annotated corpora, e.g., the Penn
TreeBank (PTB) project (Marcus et al. 1993),
have played an important role in text-mining.
The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)
(http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb) (Prasad et al.
2008a) annotates the argument structure, seman-
tics, and attribution of discourse connectives and
their arguments. The current release of PDTB-
2.0 contains the annotations of 1,808 Wall Street
Journal articles (~1 million words) from the
Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al. 1993) II distribu-
tion and a total of 40,600 discourse connective
tokens (Prasad et al. 2008b). This work exam-
ines whether the PDTB annotation guidelines
can be adapted to a different genre, the biomedi-
cal literature.

2 Notation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999806">
A discourse connective can be defined as a
word or multiword expression that signals a
discourse relation. Discourse connectives
can be subordinating conjunctions (e.g., be-
cause, when, although), coordinating con-
junctions (e.g., but, or, nor) and adverbials
(e.g., however, as a result, for example). A
discourse connective takes in two argu-
ments, Arg1 and Arg2. Arg2 is the argument
that appears in the clause that is syntacti-
cally bound to the connective and Arg1 is
the other argument. In the sentence “John
failed the exam because he was lazy” the dis-
course connective is underlined, Arg1 ap-
pears in italics and Arg2 appears in bold.

important components of a discourse relation;
namely, a discourse connective and its two ar-
guments; we did not annotate attribution. Two
linguist annotators independently annotated one
full-text biomedical article (Verpy et al. 1999)
that we randomly selected. The article is 4,937
tokens long. When the annotation work was
completed, we measured the inter-annotator
agreement, following the PDTB exact match
criterion (Miltsakaki et al. 2004). According to
this criterion, a discourse relation is in dis-
agreement if there is disagreement on any text-
span (i.e., the discourse connective or any of its
two arguments). In addition, we also measured
the agreement in the components (i.e., discourse
connectives and the arguments). We discussed
the annotation results and made suggestions to
adapt the PDTB guidelines to biomedical text.

4 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990074074074">
The first annotator identified 74 discourse con-
nectives, and the second annotator identified 75,
68 of which were the same as those identified by
the first annotator. The combined total number
of discourse connectives was 81. The overall
agreement in discourse connective identification
was 68/81=84%.
Of the 68 discourse connectives that were anno-
tated by both annotators, 31 were an exact
match, 31 had an exact match for Arg1, and 54
had an exact match for Arg2. The overall
agreement for the 68 discourse relations is
45.6% for exact match, 45.6% for Arg1, and
79.4% for Arg2. The PDTB also reported a
higher level of agreement in annotating Arg2
than in annotating Arg1 (Miltsakaki et al. 2004).
We manually analyzed the cases with disagree-
ment. We found the disagreements are nearly all
related to the annotation of citation references,
supplementary clauses, and other conventions.
When a few conventions for these cases were
added, the inter-annotator agreement went up to
85%. We also found that different interpretation
of a relation and its arguments by annotators
plays an important role for the remaining 15%
inconsistency, and domain-specific knowledge
is necessary to resolve such cases.

5 New Conventions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999433909090909">
After the completion of the pilot annotation and
the discussion, we decided to add the following
conventions to the PDTB annotation guidelines
to address the characteristics of biomedical text:
i. Citation references are to be annotated as
a part of an argument because the inclu-
sion will benefit many text-mining tasks
including identifying the semantic rela-
tions among citations.
ii. Clausal supplements (e.g., relative or
parenthetical constructions) that modify
arguments but are not minimally
necessary for the interpretation of the
relation, are annotated as part of the
arguments.
iii. We will annotate a wider variety of
nominalizations as arguments than
allowed by the PDTB guidelines.
We anticipate that these changes will both de-
crease the amount of effort required for annota-
tion and increase the reliability of the
annotation.
