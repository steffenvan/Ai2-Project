<bodyText confidence="0.9995299">
We describe a pilot study in which
a scheme for annotating events and
temporal relations between events in
text is applied to a small corpus of
newswire texts. High levels of agree-
ment between human annotators are
shown to be difficult to achieve and
we investigate where discrepancies
occur and how these might be ad-
dressed.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971963636364">
Many natural language processing applica-
tions, such as information extraction, ques-
tion answering, topic detection and tracking,
would benefit significantly from the ability to
accurately position reported events in time,
either relatively with respect to other events
or absolutely with respect to calendrical time.
To date relatively little work has been done
on the extraction of temporal information
from text. The Message Understanding Con-
ferences (MUCs) addressed the problem in
a limited way. So for example, the MUC-
6 named entity subtask required the identi-
fication of absolute time expressions in text
(MUC6, 1995), and the MUC-7 named en-
tity subtask extended this requirement to in-
clude relative time expressions (MUC7, 1998),
but neither of these tasks required placing
events in time, or temporally relating events
to each other. The MUC-5 and MUC-7 sce-
nario tasks required participants to assign a
calendrical time just to the specified scenario
event types (joint venture announcements and
rocket launchings, respectively), but this is a
limited task and the scores were low, indicat-
ing its difficulty. More recently the TIDES
Temporal Guidelines (Ferro et al., 2000) have
been developed — a very thorough set of guide-
lines for annotating time expressions. These
will clearly supercede the MUC named entity
guidelines for time expressions, but again are
not setting out to annotate events and tempo-
ral relations between events or between events
and times.
In Setzer and Gaizauskas (2000a) we in-
troduced an annotation scheme which does
address these issues. While our guidelines
also require the annotation of time expres-
sions (and are much less detailed in this re-
gard than the TIDES guidelines, which we
are happy to adopt more or less completely),
our guidelines go well beyond annotating time
expressions and also describe how to anno-
tate events and the temporal relations be-
tween events and other events or events and
times. Thus our work should be seen as es-
sentially complementary to the TIDES work,
and in our view explores where annotation of
temporal information in text should go next.
We have now carried out a pilot study in
which a group of annotators has been supplied
with our temporal annotation guidelines and
asked to apply the annotation scheme to a
trial corpus. In particular we were interested
in answers to these questions:

our temporal guidelines?

2 Annotating Temporal
Information in Text
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994804">
In this section we briefly introduce the an-
notation scheme we propose. This scheme
has been introduced in detail in Setzer and
Gaizauskas (2000a; 2000b) to which the
reader should turn for more information.

2.1 Conceptualising Time
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998950551724138">
Before we can propose an annotation scheme
we must make clear the temporal entities and
temporal relations we suppose exist. Our
temporal ontology is a pragmatic one aimed
at enabling us to identify events, determine
their relative temporal order and, if possible,
position them in calendrical time. It is not
aimed at deriving at a philosophically &apos;true&apos;
description of temporal reality.
We provide an intuitive and restricted set
of temporal entities and relations which en-
ables us to achieve our goal to a certain ex-
tent. We presume the world contains the fol-
lowing primitive types: events, times, temporal
relations and event identity.
Events Intuitively an event is something
that happens, something that one can imag-
ine putting on a time map. Events have to
be anchorable in time, and they are usually
conveyed by finite verbs and some nominal-
isations. Events can be ongoing or concep-
tually instantaneous, we do not distinguish
between these. For example, the sentence A
small single-engine plane crashed into the At-
lantic Ocean conveys an event.
Times Like events, times can be viewed as
having extent (intervals) or as being punctual
(points). Both are treated as time objects. A
time object must, however, be capable of be-
ing placed on a time line. Examples of time
objects are last Tuesday, April 4, 1998 and
March 1997 and also the referents of more
complex expressions like 17 seconds after the
crash.
Temporal Relations Events stand in cer-
tain temporal relations to other events and
to times, as in the following two examples.
The plane crashed after the pilot and his
crew ejected and A small single engine plane
crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on Wednes-
day.
The full set of temporal relations we sup-
pose at present is before, after, includes, in-
cluded and simultaneous. This is a minimal
set defined after a number of newswire articles
had been analysed; it can easily be expanded
should it prove useful or necessary.
Event Identity In newswire articles,
events are usually referred to more than
once, with subsequent references giving more
detailed information. Event identity proves
a useful and comparatively easily annotated
relation. In Setzer (2000a), we also included
subeventness as an additional event relation
to be annotated. This has been excluded
in the current work because subeventness is
very difficult to define and poses a significant
additional burden on annotators.

2.2 Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963521739131">
We give a brief overview of the annotation
scheme and describe how to annotate the en-
tities, including the main attributes that are
associated with them. For more detailed in-
formation about the attributes we again refer
to Setzer and Gaizauskas (2000a).
Events The head of the finite verb group
expressing the event is annotated as a repre-
sentative. Should the event be conveyed by a
nominalisation or a non-finite verb group then
the head of that group is chosen. The main
attributes for event annotations are a unique
ID, the event class, verb tense, one or more
other events or times to which the event is
related and the temporal relation which holds
between the event and the related events or
times.
Times The text span referring to the time
object is marked up. Times also have a unique
ID and following the approach taken in MUG,
we distinguish between dates and times (i.e.
time objects of extent greater than or less
than one day).

Temporal Relations and Event Identity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999521888888889">
Temporal relations and event identity are in-
cluded in the attributes of events. If the tem-
poral relation is explicitly signalled in the text
(e.g. by a temporal preposition) then the text
span conveying this signal is annotated as a
separate entity and given a unique ID. The
following two examples show how the enti-
ties are annotated, including their main at-
tributes.

2.3 Comparing Temporal
Annotations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993640755102041">
As with coreference relations, it is possible to
annotate semantically identical temporal rela-
tions in syntactically different ways. Should,
for example, event A happen before event B
then both &apos;A before B&apos; and &apos;13 after A&apos; are
valid representations. Further should A hap-
pen before B and B before C, then A hap-
pens before C, but in the absence of any ex-
plicit relational expression in the text, an an-
notator may or may not explicitly annotate
the relation. This problem is similar to that
addressed in defining the coreference scoring
scheme adopted in the Sixth Message Under-
standing Conference (Vilain et al., 1995), and
the solution we propose is related.
We proceed as follows. Once times, events
and temporal relations have been annotated,
relations in the text are normalised and then
a deductive closure over these relations is cal-
culated, using what is assumed to be a set of
complete temporal inference rules. The result
is a fully elaborated temporal model of the
text and any two such models can be com-
pared to calculate recall and precision figures
(in fact this procedure is carried out interac-
tively with the annotator, as discussed in sec-
tion 3.2 below, but this is not relevant to the
formal discussion here).
The procedure for deductive closure is as
follows. The IDs of the events and times an-
notated in a text form two sets, E and T,
respectively. Each of our temporal relations
is binary and thus can be viewed as a sub-
set of (E U T) x (E U T). For each tempo-
ral relation certain formal properties pertain.
For example simultaneous is an equivalence
relation, while before and includes are transi-
tive, but asymmetric and irreflexive. Given a
partially specified model of the temporal rela-
tions in a text, the deductive closure of each
relation can be computed to arrive at a total
model.
Let us denote sets of pairs from (E U T) x
(EU T) which constitute the denotations of si-
multaneous, before and includes S, B and I re-
spectively. The set of inference rules we need
to compute the deductive closure contains for
example:
Vx,y, z E (E U T) x (E U T)

• (x, y) E B A (y , z) E S = (x, z) E B
• (x, y) E IA (y, z) E S = (X, Z) el
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991595">
We can now specify what precision and re-
call mean in this framework. Letting Sk and
Sr denote the annotated simultaneous rela-
tions in the answer key and system response
respectively and Sil and SI,: their deductive
closures, respectively (and similarly for B and
I). The recall and precision for the simultane-
ous relation is given by:

<bodyText confidence="0.99666">
Recall and precision measures can be de-
fined in a parallel fashion for the other rela-
tions. An overall recall and precision measure
for all temporal relations can then be defined
as follows:

3.2 The Process of Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991796">
The recommended procedure is to annotate a
text in the following two stages. All phases of
the annotation are carried out using a GUI-
based annotation tool specifically designed for
this purpose. Stage I:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.850250333333333">
1. Annotate events, times and signals, but
no temporal relations between them.
2. Annotate explicit temporal relations be-
tween events and events and events and
times.
3. Annotate obvious implicit temporal rela-
tions, for example where times are clearly
related to events, but this is not explicitly
signalled in the text.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986022333333333">
Once this stage is complete, the temporal
deductive closure is calculated and additional
implicit temporal relations are solicited inter-
actively from the annotator. Stage II:
Until there are no temporally unrelated events
in the temporal model of the text do:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.902242111111111">
1. Draw all inferences that can be drawn
from the temporal relations given in the
current temporal model of the text ac-
cording to the temporal inference rules
and add them to the temporal model.
2. Identify an unrelated event-event or
time-event pair in the temporal model
and prompt the user for the temporal re-
lation (which may be &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot;).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995361666666667">
After these two stages the result should be a
temporal model of the text that is as complete
as possible.

3.3 The Annotation Procedure

<bodyText confidence="0.999930727272727">
Each text was annotated by either two or
three annotators, in addition to the first au-
thor who produced what in the following is
taken to be the &apos;gold standard&apos; or &apos;key&apos; annno-
tation. To produce the gold standard, an
initial annotation was created for each text,
compared with the annotations provided by
the annotators and then revised if necessary.
The result is the &apos;key&apos; annotation. On aver-
age, it took the annotators about an hour to
annotate each text.

Clearly recall and precision figures in compar-
ing annotators&apos; results with the answer keys
are not as high as one would like. For stage I,
the figures for entities alone are quite reason-
able (77/81 recall/precision on average). The
attribute figures are (60/64 recall/precision
on average) are low, but these figures are arti-
ficially lowered by, e.g., the presence of correct
implicit temporal relations in the responses
but not in the keys. However, for stage II, the
figures for temporal relations are low (40/68
recall/precision on average) and would need
to be improved before a large scale annota-
tion exercise can be undertaken. As noted
above, recall on temporal relations is effec-
tively bounded by the square of the recall on
entities, so here we are effectively limited to
60% recall.
The causes of these problems and possible
avenues for improvement include:
Imprecision/incompleteness of the
guidelines The pilot study revealed mis-
understandings on the part of the annotators
as to the extent of text to be marked up, and
confusions about, e.g. definitions of which
events to be annotated. More explanation
and further exemplification should help to
avoid these problems.
Annotator Understanding of the Task
While lack of clarity and comprehensiveness
in the guidelines may have contributed to
annotator mistakes, this is a difficult task
and more extensive training of the annotators
should also help to reduce errors.
Intrinsic difficulty of identifying which
temporal relation holds Consider the
sentence All 75 people on board the Aeroflot
Airbus died when it ploughed into a Siberian
mountain in March 1994. Is the relation be-
tween passengers dying and the plane crash
one of causality and given that, did the pas-
sengers die, after the plane crash? Or is
a plane crash an event that contains many
subevents and is the death of the passengers
part of it, which would imply that the death
occurred during the plane crash? Or did they
happen roughly at the same time, a relation
covered by our temporal relation simultane-
ous? This example shows the type of gen-
uine ambiguity encountered in our trial cor-
pus. Aside from further exemplification and
convention in the guidelines, a further pos-
sibility is that the set of temporal relations
be broadened to facilitate decisions in diffi-
cult cases.
Annotator fatigue The phase during
which the temporal closure is interactively
computed is error prone due to the sheer
number of questions asked. By intelligently
analyzing existing chains of temporal rela-
tions in the temporal model and first asking
those questions that might link existing chains
and hence yield the largest number of infer-
ences possible, the overall number of ques-
tions asked could be reduced. Allowing anno-
tators to backtrack and revise their responses
during the interactive cycle of completing the
model, rather than having to do it correctly
in one attempt, would also help in this regard.
Annotator carelessness Certain simple
forms of annotator error could be reduced by
improving the annotation tool with, for exam-
ple, edit-checking, so that non-existing events
IDs cannot be entered into the temporal rela-
tion attribute.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897625">
The task of annotating events, times and tem-
poral relations in text is clearly not an easy
one. Nevertheless we believe the pilot study
reported here demonstrates the feasibility of
carrying out this task. Further work needs
to be done to increase the accuracy and ease
with which annotators can perform the task.
But clear indications of how this can be done
have emerged from our study. We hope to
produce a larger annotated corpus, but need
to find the resources to do this.

The MUC-5 and MUC-7 scenario tasks required participants to assign a calendrical time just to the specified scenario event types (joint venture announcements and rocket launchings, respectively), but this is a limited task and the scores were low, indicating its difficulty. More recently the TIDES Temporal Guidelines (Ferro et al., 2000) have been developed — a very thorough set of guidelines for annotating time expressions. These will clearly supercede the MUC named entity guidelines for time expressions, but again are not setting out to annotate events and temporal relations between events or between events and times. In Setzer and Gaizauskas (2000a) we introduced an annotation scheme which does address these issues. While our guidelines also require the annotation of time expressions (and are much less detailed in this regard than the TIDES guidelines, which we are happy to adopt more or less completely), our guidelines go</context>

Should the event be conveyed by a nominalisation or a non-finite verb group then the head of that group is chosen. The main attributes for event annotations are a unique ID, the event class, verb tense, one or more other events or times to which the event is related and the temporal relation which holds between the event and the related events or times.

<context position="8600" citStr="Vilain et al., 1995" startWordPosition="1389" endWordPosition="1392">ns As with coreference relations, it is possible to annotate semantically identical temporal relations in syntactically different ways. Should, for example, event A happen before event B then both &apos;A before B&apos; and &apos;13 after A&apos; are valid representations. Further should A happen before B and B before C, then A happens before C, but in the absence of any explicit relational expression in the text, an annotator may or may not explicitly annotate the relation. This problem is similar to that addressed in defining the coreference scoring scheme adopted in the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (Vilain et al., 1995), and the solution we propose is related. We proceed as follows. Once times, events and temporal relations have been annotated, relations in the text are normalised and then a deductive closure over these relations is calculated, using what is assumed to be a set of complete temporal inference rules. The result is a fully elaborated temporal model of the text and any two such models can be compared to calculate recall and precision figures (in fact this procedure is carried out interactively with the annotator, as discussed in section 3.2 below, but this is not relevant to the formal discussio</context>
