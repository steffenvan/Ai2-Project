In one form or another, the phenomena associated
with &amp;quot;meaning transfer&amp;quot; have become central is-
sues in a lot of recent work on semantics. Speaking
very roughly, we can partition approaches to the
phenomenon along two dimensions, which yield
four basic points of departure. In the first two,
people have considered transfer in basically se-
mantic or linguistic terms. Some have concen-
trated on what we might call the paradigmatic
aspects of transfer, focusing on the productive
lexical processes that map semantic features into
features — for example, the &amp;quot;grinding&amp;quot; rule that
applies to turn the names of animals into mass
terms denoting their meat or fur. This the ap-
proach that&apos;s involved in most recent work on
&amp;quot;regular polysemy,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;systematic polysemy,&amp;quot; and
the like, for example by Apresjan, Ostler and
Atkins, Briscoe and Copestake, Nunberg and Za-
enen, Wilensky, Kilgarriff and a number of other
people. Other people have emphasized the syncat-
egorematic aspects of transfer; that is, the ways
meaning shifts and specifications are coerced in
the course of semantic composition. This is an ap-
proach that hass been developed in particular by
James Pustejovsky and his collaborators, building
on earlier work on type shifting.
As opposed to these, there are conceptual
and pragmatic approaches to transfer, which fo-
cus on the extralinguistic circumstances that li-
cense transfers of various types. Here again there
are both paradigmatic and syncategorematic ap-
proaches, loosely speaking. The first is exempli-
fied in a lot of recent work on metaphor by people
associated with the &amp;quot;cognitive linguistics&amp;quot; school,
which has focused chiefly on the relations between
domains of experience that metaphor variously ex-
ploits and imputes. The second is represented by
work on indirect speech within Gricean pragmat-
ics, Relevance Theory, and the like, which has
been chiefly concerned with specifying the con-
versational conditions that give rise to metaphor,
irony, and analogous phenomena.
Of course this categorization is somewhat fac-
titious. The borders between these approaches are
highly porous, and most work on transfer over-
laps several of them. This is entirely appropriate,
since these are in no sense competing theories or
accounts of the phenomena. Transfer is clearly a
linguistic process, and in many of its most impor-
tant forms a lexical one. But it just as clearly
has its basis in very general cognitive and commu-
nicative principles. And while it&apos;s reasonable that
people should choose to focus on one or another
of these considerations relative to their immediate
interests, it is also useful to keep the Big Picture in
mind, lest we inadvertently ascribe to one domain
of explanation a responsibility that more properly
belongs to another. This is the picture I want to
sketch out in this talk.
A comprehensive account of transfer has to
make appeal to three different kinds of regulari-
ties or rules. The first are nonlinguistic: the cor-
respondences between domains, real or imputed,
that transfer invokes, and the communicative in-
terests that may make these invocations useful or
instructive — they enable us to identify one thing
in virtue of its relation to another, explain an ab-
stract domain by reference to a concrete one, and
so forth. Second, there is the repertory of general
linguistic processes of transfer that exploit these
correspondences and principles. By these I have
in mind not traditional categories like metaphor,
synecdoche, and metonymy — distinctions that
have basically to do with the kinds of domain cor-
respondences that transfer exploits — but the var-
ious types of operations that make possible type-
shifting and sortal reassignment of expressions,
syntactic recategorizations, and deferred indexical
reference. These processes may cross-cut the types
of domain correspondences that they exploit, and
I&apos;ll show that we often find a single type of domain
correspondence underlying two or more distinct
semantic processes of transfer. Third, there are
the language-specific instantiations of these oper-
ations, for example in the form of constructions
or lexical rules that license particular types or

subtypes of transfers (for example some language,
like Greenlandic Eskimo, permit &amp;quot;grinding&amp;quot; of tree
names to yield names of types of woods, but not of
animal names to yield the names of furs or meats.)
In the first part of this talk, I&apos;ll focus on one
of the general processes that underlie transfer: the
semantic operation of &amp;quot;predicate transfer,&amp;quot; which
licenses the sortal reassignment of expressions de-
noting properties and relations, and which under-
lies a great deal of lexical polysemy. The process
I have in mind is illustrated by an example like &amp;quot;I
am parked out back.&amp;quot; This is usually regarded as
a classic instance of metonymy i.e.,&amp;quot;person&amp;quot; for
&amp;quot;car&amp;quot; — where we use an expression that would
conventionally denote one thing to refer to some
other thing to which it is connected by a &amp;quot;rela-
tion of contiguity.&amp;quot; But I&apos;ll show that on consid-
eration there are compelling reasons for supposing
that I here refers to the speaker, rather than his
car. (For one thing the number of the pronoun
doesn&apos;t vary according to the number of cars in-
volved: if you had two cars parked out back you
wouldn&apos;t say &amp;quot;We are parked out back,&amp;quot; though
of course this would be the appropriate thing to
say to refer to a single car owned by two or more
people). And other morphological and syntactic
observations support the same conclusion: in ex-
amples like this what has been transferred is the
meaning of the predicate, rather than its argu-
ment. That is, the predicate parked out back has a
transferred reading here: it denotes the property
that the speaker acquires in virtue of his relation
to a car that has the property of being parked out
back.
Two conditions have to be satisfied before
predicate transfers like this one are licensed. First,
there has to be a salient correspondence (more
specifically, an injective function) between the
properties of things in one domain and the prop-
erties of things in another; e.g., between the lo-
cations of cars in a lot and the properties that
distinguish the owner of one car from the owner of
another. Second, it has to be either useful or in-
teresting to know that these acquired or inherited
properties apply to their carriers: that&apos;s why we
can say &amp;quot;I am parked out back&amp;quot; to someone who
is about to go get the car, whereas it is hard to
imagine a context in which one would want to say
&amp;quot;I was once driven by Ricardo Montalban.&amp;quot;
I will give a simple formal account of these
conditions on predicate transfer, and then show
how it resolves some familiar syntactic and seman-
tic difficulties. Take Jackendoff&apos;s example, &amp;quot;Ringo
squeezed himself into a narrow parking space.&amp;quot;
If we analyze this as involving a metonymy, we
will have to say that the reflexive here denotes
something distinct from its antecedent, and so
make provision for certain sortal shifts in giving
the identity conditions on reflexivization and other
rules and constructions ordinarily require corefer-
ence of pronoun and antecedent. Whereas now
we will take squeeze into a narrow parking place
as a transferred predicate that denotes a relation
between persons: in virtue of having squeezed his
car into a space, that is, Ringo has also done some-
thing noteworthy to himself. More generally, I&apos;ll
argue that the conditions on rules of anaphora
and similar operations need never provide for sor-
tal shifts; sortally speaking, we must always take
&amp;quot;syntactic identity&amp;quot; in the strictest possible way.
In the second part of this paper, I&apos;ll show how
predicate transfer is instantiated lexically in the
rules that provide for systematic polysemy. I&apos;ll
mention several familiar cases: grinding, conver-
sion of names of artists to the names of their works
(e.g., a Picasso, an Agatha Christie, and the use
of the names of publications like newspaper and
magazine for the organizations that produce them.
Each of these processes is subject to a variety of
constraints, which may answer any of several dif-
ferent principles. Some are due to the absence of
perceived domain correspondences of the appro-
priate type (for example, the reluctance of words
like mammal and bird to undergo grinding. Some
are explained by the fact that the acquired prop-
erty denoted by the transferred predicate is insuf-
ficiently noteworthy or criteria!: that is why we
don&apos;t say She was reading a Kafka. Still others
are due to the absence of specific lexical licenses
for certain types of transfer; this explains why we
don&apos;t generally use the &amp;quot;artist for work&amp;quot; rule to de-
rive the names of musical works (?two Beethovens,
?several Elvises), or why grinding does not apply
in English to derive the names of liquids ? We al-
ways cook with olive. All of this by way of showing
why it is important to bear in mind the hetero-
geneity of the mechanisms that underlie transfers
of all types.
