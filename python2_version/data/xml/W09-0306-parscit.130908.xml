We present a valency lexicon for Latin verbs
extracted from the Index Thomisticus Tree-
bank, a syntactically annotated corpus of Me-
dieval Latin texts by Thomas Aquinas.
In our corpus-based approach, the lexicon re-
flects the empirical evidence of the source
data. Verbal arguments are induced directly
from annotated data.
The lexicon contains 432 Latin verbs with 270
valency frames. The lexicon is useful for NLP
applications and is able to support annotation.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999106">
Over the last decades, annotated corpora and
computational lexicons have gained an increas-
ing role among language resources in computa-
tional linguistics: on the one hand, they are used
to train Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools such as parsers and PoS taggers; on the
other hand, they are developed through auto-
matic procedures of linguistic annotation and
lexical acquisition.
The relation between annotated corpora and
computational lexicons is circular: as a matter of
fact, if linguistic annotation of textual data is
supported and improved by the use of lexicons,
these latter can be induced from annotated data
in a corpus-based fashion.
In the field of cultural heritage and in particu-
lar that of classical languages studies, much ef-
fort has been devoted throughout the years to the
digitization of texts, but only recently have some
projects begun to annotate them above the mor-
phological level.
Concerning lexicology and lexicography of
classical languages, a long tradition has produced
and established many dictionaries, thesauri and
lexicons, providing examples from real texts.
Nevertheless, nowadays it is possible and indeed
necessary to match lexicons with data from (an-
notated) corpora, and viceversa. This requires the
scholars to exploit the vast amount of textual
data from classical languages already available in
digital format,1 and particularly those annotated
at the highest levels. The evidence provided by
the texts themselves can be fully represented in
lexicons induced from these data. Subsequently,
these lexicons can be used to support the textual
annotation itself in a virtuous circle.
This paper reports on the creation of a valency
lexicon induced from the Index Thomisticus
Treebank, a syntactically annotated corpus of
Medieval Latin texts by Thomas Aquinas. The
paper is organised as follows: section 2 describes
the available Latin treebanks, their annotation
guidelines and gives some specific information
on the Index Thomisticus treebank; section 3
deals with the notion of valency, while section 4
describes the state of the art on valency lexicons;
section 5 illustrates the procedures of acquisition
and representation of our valency lexicon; fi-
nally, section 6 draws some conclusions and de-
scribes future work.

Latin is a richly inflected language, showing:
- discontinuous constituents (‘non-
projectivity’): this means that phrasal con-
stituents may not be continuous, but broken
up by words of other constituents. An exam-
ple is the following sentence by Ovid
(Metamorphoses, I.1-2): “In nova fert ani-
mus mutatas dicere formas corpora” (“My
mind leads me to tell of forms changed into
new bodies”). In this sentence, both the
nominal phrases “nova corpora” and “muta-
tas formas” are discontinuous;
- moderately free word-order: for instance, the
order of the words in a sentence like “au-

daces fortuna iuvat” (“fortune favours the
bold”) could be changed into “fortuna au-
daces iuvat”, or “fortuna iuvat audaces”,
without affecting the meaning of the sen-
tence.
These features of Latin influenced the choice
of Dependency Grammars (DG)2 as the most
suitable grammar framework for building Latin
annotated corpora like treebanks.
While since the 1970s the first treebanks were
annotated via Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG)-
based schemata (as in IBM, Lancaster and, later
on, Penn treebanks), in the past decade many
projects of dependency treebanks development
have started, such as the ALPINO treebank for
Dutch (Van der Beek et al., 2002), the Turin
University Treebank for Italian (Lesmo et al.,
2002), or the Danish Dependency Treebank
(Kromann, 2003). On the one hand, this is due to
the fact that the first treebanks were mainly Eng-
lish language corpora. PSG were a suitable
framework for a poorly inflected language like
English, showing a fixed word-order and few
discontinuous constituents. Later on, the syntac-
tic annotation of moderately free word-order lan-
guages required the adoption of the DG frame-
work, which is more appropriate than PSG for
such a task. On the other hand, Carroll et al.
(1998) showed that inter-annotator agreement
was significantly better for dependency tree-
banks, indicating that phrase structure annotation
was requiring too many irrelevant decisions (see
also Lin, 1995).
Although much Latin data is nowadays avail-
able in digital format, the first two projects for
the development of Latin treebanks have only
recently started: namely the Latin Dependency
Treebank (LDT) at the Tufts University in Bos-
ton (within the Perseus Digital Library) based on
texts of the Classical era (Bamman, 2006), and
the Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB) at the
Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan,
based on the Opera omnia of Thomas Aquinas
(Passarotti, 2007).
Taking into account the above mentioned fea-
tures of Latin, both the treebanks independently
chose the DG framework as the most suitable
one for data annotation. The same approach was
later on followed by a third Latin treebank now

2 With Tesnière (1959) as a common background, there are
many different current DG flavours. See for instance the
following: Dependency Unification Grammar (Hellwig,
1986), Functional Generative Description (Sgall, Hajičová
and Panevová, 1986), Meaning Text Theory (Mel’čuk,
1988), Word Grammar (Hudson, 1990).

Oslo in the context of the PROIEL project
(Pragmatic Resources in Old Indo-European
Languages): the aim of PROIEL is the syntactic
annotation of the oldest extant versions of the
New Testament in Indo-European languages,
including Greek, Latin, Gothic, Armenian and
Church Slavonic (Haug and Jøhndal, 2008).

2.1 Annotation Guidelines
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901085714285">
Since LDT and IT-TB were the first projects of
their kind for Latin, no prior established guide-
lines were available to rely on for syntactic anno-
tation.
Therefore, the so-called ‘analytical layer’ of
annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank
(PDT) for Czech (Hajič et al., 1999) was chosen
and adapted to specific or idiosyncratic construc-
tions of Latin. These constructions (such as the
ablative absolute or the passive periphrastic)
could be syntactically annotated in several dif-
ferent ways and are common to Latin of all eras.
Rather than have each treebank project decide
upon and record each decision for annotating
them, LDT and IT-TB decided to pool their re-
sources and create a single annotation manual
that would govern both treebanks (Bamman et
al., 2007a; Bamman et al., 2007b; Bamman et al.,
2008).
As we are dealing with Latin dialects sepa-
rated by 13 centuries, sharing a single annotation
manual is very useful for comparison purposes,
such as checking annotation consistency or dia-
chronically studying specific syntactic construc-
tions. In addition, the task of data annotation
through these common guidelines allows annota-
tors to base their decisions on a variety of exam-
ples from a wider range of texts and combine the
two datasets in order to train probabilistic de-
pendency parsers.
Although the PROIEL annotation guidelines
are grounded on the same grammar framework
as the LDT and IT-TB, they differ in a number of
details, some of which are described in Passarotti
(forthcoming).

2.2 The Index Thomisticus Treebank

The Index Thomisticus (IT) by Roberto Busa SJ
(1974-1980) was begun in 1949 and is consid-
ered a groundbreaking project in computational
linguistics. It is a database containing the Opera
omnia of Thomas Aquinas (118 texts) as well as
61 texts by other authors related to Thomas, for a
total of around 11 million tokens. The corpus is
morphologically tagged and lemmatised.

Early in the 1970’s Busa started to plan a pro-
ject aimed at both the morphosyntactic disam-
biguation of the IT lemmatisation and the syntac-
tic annotation of its sentences. Today, these tasks
are performed by the IT-TB project, which is
part of the wider ‘Lessico Tomistico Bicul-
turale’, a project whose target is the development
of a lexicon from the IT texts.3
Presently, the size of the IT-TB is 46,456 to-

3 Valency
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998614870967742">
As outlined above, the notion of valency is gen-
erally defined as the number of complements
required by a word: these obligatory comple-
ments are usually named ‘arguments’, while the
non-obligatory ones are referred to as ‘adjuncts’.
Although valency can refer to different parts of
speech (usually verbs, nouns and adjectives),
scholars have mainly focused their attention on
verbs, so that the notion of valency often coin-
cides with verbal valency.
Valency is widely used in DG formalisms, but
it also figures in PSG-based formalisms like
HPSG and LFG.
While Karl Bühler can be considered as the
pioneer of the modern theory of valency,4 Lucien
Tesnière is widely recognised as its real founder.
Tesnière views valency as a quantitative quality
of verbs, since only verbs constrain both the
quantity and the quality (i.e. nouns and adverbs)
of their obligatory arguments; through a meta-
phor borrowed from drama, Tesnière classifies
dependents into actants (arguments) and circon-
stants (adjuncts): “Le noeud verbal [...] exprime
tout un petit drame. Comme un drame en effet, il
comporte obligatoirement un procès, et le plus
souvent des acteurs et des circonstances. Trans-
posés du plan de la réalité dramatique sur celui
de la syntaxe structurale, le procès, les acteurs et
les circonstances deviennent respectivement le
verbe, les actants et les circonstants” (Tesnière,
1959: 102).5

4 In the Sprachtheorie, he writes that “die Wörter einer bes-
timmten Wortklasse eine oder mehrere Leerstellen um sich
eröffnen, die durch Wörter bestimmter anderer Wortklassen
ausgefüllt werden müssen” (Bühler, 1934: 173) (“words of a
certain word-class open up around themselves one or sev-
eral empty spaces that have to be filled by words of certain
other word-classes”; our translation).
5 “The verbal node expresses a whole little drama. As a
drama, it implies a process and, most of the times, actors
Arguments can be either obligatory or op-
tional, depending on which sense of the verb is
involved. For example, the seem sense of the
verb appear requires two obligatory arguments
in active clauses, as in the following sentence:
“That lawyer appears to love his work”. Here the
second argument (“to love his work”) cannot be
left out without changing the meaning of the
verb. On the other hand, optional arguments are
recorded into the verbal argument structure itself,
althought they may not appear at the clausal
level. For instance, in the following sentence the
object required by the verb eat is missing, but the
sentence is still acceptable: “He eats (some-
thing)”.
Optionality can also act at the communicative
level as well as at the structural one. For in-
stance, adjuncts can be necessary for communi-
cative intelligibility in particular contexts, as in
the following sentence: “I met James at the Mar-
quee club”, where the locative adverbial (“at the
Marquee club”) is required to answer a question
like “Where did you meet James?”. On the other
hand, structural optionality depends on the fea-
tures of the language and applies at the clausal
level. For instance, as a poorly inflected lan-
guage, English requires the subject of a predicate
to be expressed in declarative and interrogative
main clauses, so that a sentence like the follow-
ing is ungrammatical if the subject is missing:
“[I] slept all morning”.
Given the so-called “syntax-semantics inter-
face” (Levin, 1993), arguments are generally
associated with a predicate sense rather than a
predicate form, and are structured in sequences
called ‘subcategorization frames’ (SCFs) or
‘complementation patterns’. For example, there
is a semantic difference between the bill sense
and the attack sense of the verb charge in Eng-
lish, as in the following sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8989685">
- (a) “The hotel charges 80 euros for a night”.
- (b) “The army charged the enemy”.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.826953">
In these sentences, the two predicate senses
show two different SCFs:

- (a) [Subj_NP, Pred, Obj_NP, Obj_PP-for]
- (b) [Pred, Obj_NP]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.947319">
Arguments are also selected by verbs accord-
ing to lexical-semantic properties, called ‘selec-
tional preferences’ (SPs) or ‘selectional restric-
tions’. For example, a sentence like “*The train
flew to Rome” is ungrammatical, since it violates
and circumstances. Transposed from the dramatic reality to
structural syntax, the process, the actors and the circum-
stances respectively become the verb, the actants and the
circumstants” (our translation).

4 Valency Lexicons
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978277777778">
Over the past years, several valency lexicons
have been built within different theoretical
frameworks: these lexicons have an important
role in the NLP community thanks to their wide
applications in NLP components, such as pars-
ing, word sense disambiguation, automatic verb
classification and selectional preference acquisi-
tion.
As shown in Urešová (2004), a valency lexi-
con can also help the task of linguistic annotation
(as in treebank development), providing annota-
tors with essential information about the number
and types of arguments realized at the syntactic
level for a specific verb, along with semantic
information on the verb’s lexical preferences.
In the phase of lexicon creation, both intui-
tion-based and corpus-based approaches can be
pursued, according to the role played by human
intuition and empirical evidence extracted from
annotated corpora such as treebanks.
For instance, lexicons like PropBank (Kings-
bury and Palmer, 2002), FrameNet (Ruppenhofer
et al., 2006) and PDT-Vallex (Hajič et al., 2003)
have been created in an intuition-based fashion
and then checked and improved with examples
from corpora.
On the other side, research in lexical acqui-
sition has recently made available a number of
valency lexicons automatically acquired from
annotated corpora, such as VALEX (Korhonen,
et al., 2006) and LexShem (Messiant et al.,
2008). Unlike the fully intuition-based ones,
these lexicons aim at systematically reflecting
the evidence provided by data, with very little
human intervention. The role of intuition is
therefore left to the annotation phase (where the
annotator interprets the corpus data), and not ex-
tended to the development of the lexicon itself.
Corpus-based lexicons show several advan-
tages if compared with traditional human-
developed dictionaries. Firstly, they systemati-
cally reflect the evidence of the corpus they were
extracted from, while acquiring information spe-
cific to the domain of the corpus. Secondly,
unlike manually built lexicons, they are not
prone to human errors that are difficult to detect,
such as omissions and inconsistencies. In addi-
tion, such lexicons usually display statistical in-
formation in their entries, such as the actual fre-
quency of subcategorization frames as attested in
the original corpus. Finally, they are less costly
than hand-crafted lexical resources in terms of
time, money and human resources.
While several subcategorization lexicons
have been compiled for modern languages, much
work in this field still remains to be done on
classical languages such as Greek and Latin. Re-
garding Latin, Happ reports a list of Latin verbs
along with their valencies (Happ, 1976: 480-
565). Bamman and Crane (2008) describe a “dy-
namic lexicon” automatically extracted from the
Perseus Digital Library, using the LDT as a
training set. This lexicon displays qualitative and
quantitative information on subcategorization
patterns and selectional preferences of each word
as it is used in every Latin author of the corpus.
Relying on morphological tagging and statistical
syntactic parsing of such a large corpus, their
approach finds the most common arguments and
the most common lexical fillers of these argu-
ments, thus reducing the noise caused by the
automatic pre-processing of the data.

5 The Index Thomisticus Treebank
Valency Lexicon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983704">
We propose a corpus-based valency lexicon for
Latin verbs automatically induced from IT-TB
data. The automatic procedure allows both the
extension of this work to the LDT (thanks to the
common annotation guidelines) and the updating
of the lexicon as the treebank size increases.
First, we automatically extract the argu-
ments of all the occurrences of verbal lemmata in
the treebank, along with their morphological fea-
tures and lexical fillers.
In the IT-TB, verbal arguments are anno-
tated using the following tags: Sb (Subject), Obj
(Object), OComp (Object Complement) and
Pnom (Predicate Nominal); adjuncts are anno-
tated with the tag Adv (Adverbial). The differ-
ence between Obj and Adv corresponds to the
that between direct or indirect arguments (except
subjects) and adjuncts. A special kind of Obj is
the determining complement of the object, which
is tagged with OComp, such as senatorem in the
phrase “aliquem senatorem facere” (“to nominate
someone senator”). Conversely, the determining
complement of the subject is tagged as Pnom, as
in “aliquis senator fit” (“someone becomes sena-
tor”).6
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.85649625">
6 As in the PDT, all of the syntactic tags can be appended
with a suffix in the event that the given node is member of a
coordinated construction (_Co), an apposition (_Ap) or a
parenthetical statement (_Pa).

In order to retrieve the arguments realised
for each verbal occurrence in the treebank, spe-
cific database queries have been created to
search for the nodes depending on a verbal head
through the functional tags listed above.
The head-dependent relation can be either
direct or indirect, since intermediate nodes may
intervene. These nodes are prepositions (tag
AuxP), conjunctions (tag AuxC) and coordinat-
ing or apposing elements (respectively, tags Co-
ord and Apos).
For example, see the following sentences:
- [1] “primo determinat formam baptismi;”7
(“at first it determines the form of the bap-
tism;”)
- [2] “ly aliquid autem, et ly unum non deter-
minant aliquam formam vel naturam;”8 (“the
‘something’ and the ‘one’ do not determine
any form or nature”)

Tree of sentence [2]
In the case of indirect relation, the interme-
diate nodes need to be detected and extracted, in
order to be inserted into the lexicon as subcate-
gorization structures containing the syntactic
roles of the verbal arguments. To represent these
structures, we distinguished two major types of
them: subcategorization frames (SCFs) and sub-
categorization classes (SCCs).
An SCF contains the sequence of functional
labels of verbal arguments as they appear in the
sentence order, whereas an SCC reports the sub-
categorization elements disregarding their linear
order in the sentence. SCFs and SCCs play a dif-
ferent role in our lexicon. On the one hand, SCFs
are very detailed patterns useful for diachronic
and/or comparative studies on linear order. On
the other hand, SCCs are more general and make
the data in the lexicon comparable with the sub-
categorization structures as usually defined in the
literature and in other valency lexicons. For each
of these structures we then created the following
sub-types, ranging from the most specific to the
least specific one.
SCF1: subcategorization frame marking the
full path between the verbal head (referred to as
‘V’) and each of its argument nodes in the tree.
SCF1 also assigns the same index to those argu-
ment nodes linked by coordinating or apposing
elements. For instance, the SCF1 of the verbal
and naturam, depends on the coordinating node vel. For
more details, see Hajic et al. (1999), 236-238.

head determino10 in sentence [1] is ‘V + Obj’,
while in sentence [2] is ‘(Coord)Sb_Co(1) + (Co-
ord)Sb_Co(1) + V + (Coord)Obj_Co(2) + (Co-
ord)Obj_Co(2)’. In the latter, the intermediate
nodes Coord are in square brackets and indices 1
and 2 link the coordinated nodes. These indices
have been adopted in order to disambiguate sub-
categorization structures where more Obj_Co
tags can refer to different verbal arguments. For
instance, in a sentence like “I give X and Y to W
and Z”, both the tranferred objects (X and Y) and
the receivers (W and Z) are annotated with
Obj_Co. Using indices, the subcategorization
structure of the verb give in this sentence appears
as follows: ‘Sb + V + (Coord)Obj_Co(1) + (Co-
ord)Obj_Co(1) + (Coord)Obj_Co(2) + (Co-
ord)Obj_Co(2)’. The indices cannot be applied a
priori to subsequent arguments, since Latin, al-
lowing discontinuous constituents, can show
cases where coindexed nodes are separated by
other lexical items in the linear order.

SCF2: a subcategorization frame containing
only the labels and the indices of the arguments,

only the argument labels. The SCC3 of determino
is ‘{Obj}’ in [1] and ‘{Sb, Obj}’ in [2], showing
that in this sentence determino is used as a biar-
gumental verb, regardless of the number of lexi-
cal fillers realised for each of its arguments at the

Presently, the size of the IT-TB valency lexicon

to 5966 wordforms), with 270 different SCF1s. In

the lexicon reflects the empirical evidence given
by the data it was extracted from, encouraging
linguistic studies on the particular language do-
main of our corpus.
In addition to the syntactic information re-

it is possible at each stage to include both the
morphological features and the lexical fillers of
verbal arguments, helping define verbal selec-
tional preferences.
The lexicon may also be useful for improv-
ing the performance of statistical parsers, enrich-
ing the information acquired by parsers on verbal
entries. On the other hand, moving from parser
performance to lexicon development, the lexicon
can be induced from automatically parsed texts
when an accurate parsing system is available.
The syntactic and lexical data recorded in the
lexicon are also important in further semantic
NLP applications, such as word sense disam-
biguation, anaphora and ellipsis resolution, and
selectional preference acquisition. Following a
widespread approach in valency lexicons, a close
connection between valency frames and word
senses will be followed in the description of lexi-
con entries: this means that each headword entry
of our lexicon will consist of one or more SCFs
and SCCs, one for each sense of the word.
We plan to make the lexicon available on-
line through a graphical interface usable also
during the annotation procedures, as has been
already done for the PDT via the tree editor
TrEd.11 In this way, the consistency of the anno-
tation process can be tested and enforced thanks
to the information stored in the lexicon.
In order to test the accuracy of our system, it
will be also necessary to evaluate the quality of
our valency lexicon against the Perseus “dy-
namic lexicon”, Happ’s list and other existing
resources for Latin, such as traditional dictionar-
ies and thesauri. A comparison with the lexicon
by Perseus is also very interesting in a contras-
tive diachronic perspective, as it may show im-
portant linguistic differences between Classical
and Medieval Latin.

(1998) showed that inter-annotator agreement was significantly better for dependency treebanks, indicating that phrase structure annotation was requiring too many irrelevant decisions (see also Lin, 1995). Although much Latin data is nowadays available in digital format, the first two projects for the development of Latin treebanks have only recently started: namely the Latin Dependency Treebank (LDT) at the Tufts University in Boston (within the Perseus Digital Library) based on texts of the Classical era (Bamman, 2006), and the Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB) at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, based on the Opera omnia of Thomas Aquinas (Passarotti, 2007). Taking into account the above mentioned features of Latin, both the treebanks independently chose the DG framework as the most suitable one for data annotation. The same approach was later on followed by a third Latin treebank now 2 With Tesnière (1959) as a common background, there are many different current DG flavours.

In addition, such lexicons usually display statistical information in their entries, such as the actual frequency of subcategorization frames as attested in the original corpus. Finally, they are less costly than hand-crafted lexical resources in terms of time, money and human resources. While several subcategorization lexicons have been compiled for modern languages, much work in this field still remains to be done on classical languages such as Greek and Latin. Regarding Latin, Happ reports a list of Latin verbs along with their valencies (Happ, 1976: 480- 565). Bamman and Crane (2008) describe a “dynamic lexicon” automatically extracted from the Perseus Digital Library, using the LDT as a training set. This lexicon displays qualitative and quantitative information on subcategorization patterns and selectional preferences of each word as it is used in every Latin author of the corpus. Relying on morphological tagging and statistical syntactic parsing of such a large corpus, their approach finds the most common arguments and the most common lexical fillers of these arguments, thus reducing the noise caused by the automatic pre-processing of the data. 5 The Index Thomisticus </context>

Therefore, the so-called ‘analytical layer’ of annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) for Czech (Hajič et al., 1999) was chosen and adapted to specific or idiosyncratic constructions of Latin. These constructions (such as the ablative absolute or the passive periphrastic) could be syntactically annotated in several different ways and are common to Latin of all eras. Rather than have each treebank project decide upon and record each decision for annotating them, LDT and IT-TB decided to pool their resources and create a single annotation manual that would govern both treebanks (Bamman et al., 2007a; Bamman et al., 2007b; Bamman et al., 2008).

In addition, such lexicons usually display statistical information in their entries, such as the actual frequency of subcategorization frames as attested in the original corpus. Finally, they are less costly than hand-crafted lexical resources in terms of time, money and human resources. While several subcategorization lexicons have been compiled for modern languages, much work in this field still remains to be done on classical languages such as Greek and Latin. Regarding Latin, Happ reports a list of Latin verbs along with their valencies (Happ, 1976: 480- 565). Bamman and Crane (2008) describe a “dynamic lexicon” automatically extracted from the Perseus Digital Library, using the LDT as a training set. This lexicon displays qualitative and quantitative information on subcategorization patterns and selectional preferences of each word as it is used in every Latin author of the corpus. Relying on morphological tagging and statistical syntactic parsing of such a large corpus, their approach finds the most common arguments and the most common lexical fillers of these arguments, thus reducing the noise caused by the automatic pre-processing o</context>

As shown in Urešová (2004), a valency lexicon can also help the task of linguistic annotation (as in treebank development), providing annotators with essential information about the number and types of arguments realized at the syntactic level for a specific verb, along with semantic information on the verb’s lexical preferences. In the phase of lexicon creation, both intuition-based and corpus-based approaches can be pursued, according to the role played by human intuition and empirical evidence extracted from annotated corpora such as treebanks. For instance, lexicons like PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002), FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006) and PDT-Vallex (Hajič et al., 2003) have been created in an intuition-based fashion and then checked and improved with examples from corpora.

On the other hand, structural optionality depends on the features of the language and applies at the clausal level. For instance, as a poorly inflected language, English requires the subject of a predicate to be expressed in declarative and interrogative main clauses, so that a sentence like the following is ungrammatical if the subject is missing: “[I] slept all morning”. Given the so-called “syntax-semantics interface” (Levin, 1993), arguments are generally associated with a predicate sense rather than a predicate form, and are structured in sequences called ‘subcategorization frames’ (SCFs) or ‘complementation patterns’. For example, there is a semantic difference between the bill sense and the attack sense of the verb charge in English, as in the following sentences: - (a) “The hotel charges 80 euros for a night”. - (b) “The army charged the enemy”. In these sentences, the two predicate senses show two different SCFs: - (a) [Subj_NP, Pred, Obj_NP, Obj_PP-for] - (b) [Pred, Obj_NP] Arguments are also selected by verbs ac</context>

Although much Latin data is nowadays available in digital format, the first two projects for the development of Latin treebanks have only recently started: namely the Latin Dependency Treebank (LDT) at the Tufts University in Boston (within the Perseus Digital Library) based on texts of the Classical era (Bamman, 2006), and the Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB) at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, based on the Opera omnia of Thomas Aquinas (Passarotti, 2007). Taking into account the above mentioned features of Latin, both the treebanks independently chose the DG framework as the most suitable one for data annotation. The same approach was later on followed by a third Latin treebank now 2 With Tesnière (1959) as a common background, there are many different current DG flavours.

In the phase of lexicon creation, both intuition-based and corpus-based approaches can be pursued, according to the role played by human intuition and empirical evidence extracted from annotated corpora such as treebanks. For instance, lexicons like PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002), FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006) and PDT-Vallex (Hajič et al., 2003) have been created in an intuition-based fashion and then checked and improved with examples from corpora. On the other side, research in lexical acquisition has recently made available a number of valency lexicons automatically acquired from annotated corpora, such as VALEX (Korhonen, et al., 2006) and LexShem (Messiant et al., 2008). Unlike the fully intuition-based ones, these lexicons aim at systematically reflecting the evidence provided by data, with very little human intervention. The role of intuition is therefore left to the annotation phase (where </context>

Comme un drame en effet, il comporte obligatoirement un procès, et le plus souvent des acteurs et des circonstances.

As shown in Urešová (2004), a valency lexicon can also help the task of linguistic annotation (as in treebank development), providing annotators with essential information about the number and types of arguments realized at the syntactic level for a specific verb, along with semantic information on the verb’s lexical preferences.
