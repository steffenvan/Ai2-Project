Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99844776">
Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a mar-
ketplace for so-called “human intelligence
tasks” (HITs), or tasks that are easy for hu-
mans but currently difficult for automated pro-
cesses. Providers upload tasks to MTurk
which workers then complete. Natural lan-
guage annotation is one such human intelli-
gence task. In this paper, we investigate us-
ing MTurk to collect annotations for Subjec-
tivity Word Sense Disambiguation (SWSD),
a coarse-grained word sense disambiguation
task. We investigate whether we can use
MTurk to acquire good annotations with re-
spect to gold-standard data, whether we can
filter out low-quality workers (spammers), and
whether there is a learning effect associated
with repeatedly completing the same kind of
task. While our results with respect to spam-
mers are inconclusive, we are able to ob-
tain high-quality annotations for the SWSD
task. These results suggest a greater role for
MTurk with respect to constructing a large
scale SWSD system in the future, promising
substantial improvement in subjectivity and
sentiment analysis.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999762695652174">
Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems
rely on large amounts of manually annotated data
that is collected from domain experts. The anno-
tation process to obtain this data is very laborious
and expensive. This makes supervised NLP systems
subject to a so-called knowledge acquisition bottle-
neck. For example, (Ng, 1997) estimates an effort of
16 person years to construct training data for a high-
accuracy domain independent Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD) system.
Recently researchers have been investigating
Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) as a source of
non-expert natural language annotation, which is a
cheap and quick alternative to expert annotations
(Kaisser and Lowe, 2008; Mrozinski et al., 2008).
In this paper, we utilize MTurk to obtain training
data for Subjectivity Word Sense Disambiguation
(SWSD) as described in (Akkaya et al., 2009). The
goal of SWSD is to automatically determine which
word instances in a corpus are being used with sub-
jective senses, and which are being used with ob-
jective senses. SWSD is a new task which suffers
from the absence of a substantial amount of anno-
tated data and thus can only be applied on a small
scale. SWSD has strong connections to WSD. Like
supervised WSD, it requires training data where tar-
get word instances – words which need to be dis-
ambiguated by the system – are labeled as having
an objective sense or a subjective sense. (Akkaya
et al., 2009) show that SWSD may bring substantial
improvement in subjectivity and sentiment analysis,
if it could be applied on a larger scale. The good
news is that training data for 80 selected keywords is
enough to make a substantial difference (Akkaya et
al., 2009). Thus, large scale SWSD is feasible. We
hypothesize that annotations for SWSD can be pro-
vided by non-experts reliably if the annotation task
is presented in a simple way.
The annotations obtained from MTurk workers
are noisy by nature, because MTurk workers are
not trained for the underlying annotation task. That
is why previous work explored methods to assess
annotation quality and to aggregate multiple noisy
annotations for high reliability (Snow et al., 2008;
Callison-Burch, 2009). It is understandable that not
every worker will provide high-quality annotations,

depending on their background and interest. Un-
fortunately, some MTurk workers do not follow the
annotation guidelines and carelessly submit annota-
tions in order to gain economic benefits with only
minimal effort. We define this group of workers
as spammers. We believe it is essential to distin-
guish between workers as well-meaning annotators
and workers as spammers who should be filtered out
as a first step when utilizing MTurk. In this work,
we investigate how well the built-in qualifications in
MTurk function as such a filter.
Another important question about MTurk workers
is whether they learn to provide better annotations
over time in the absence of any interaction and feed-
back. The presence of a learning effect may support
working with the same workers over a long time and
creating private groups of workers. In this work, we
also examine if there is a learning effect associated
with MTurk workers.

To summarize, in this work we investigate the fol-

enough to avoid spammers ?

workers ?

<bodyText confidence="0.922864">
Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)1 is a market-
place for so-called “human intelligence tasks,” or
HITs. MTurk has two kinds of users: providers and
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999882452380952">
workers. Providers create HITs using the Mechan-
ical Turk API and, for a small fee, upload them to
the HIT database. Workers search through the HIT
database, choosing which to complete in exchange
for monetary compensation. Anyone can sign up as
a provider and/or worker. Each HIT has an associ-
ated monetary value, and after reviewing a worker’s
submission, a provider may choose whether to ac-
cept the submission and pay the worker the promised
sum or to reject it and pay the worker nothing. HITs
typically consist of tasks that are easy for humans
but difficult or impossible for computers to complete
quickly or effectively, such as annotating images,
transcribing speech audio, or writing a summary of
a video.
One challenge for requesters using MTurk is that
of filtering out spammers and other workers who
consistently produce low-quality annotations. In or-
der to allow requesters to restrict the range of work-
ers who can complete their tasks, MTurk provides
several types of built-in statistics, known as quali-
fications. One such qualification is approval rating,
a statistic that records a worker’s ratio of accepted
HITs compared to the total number of HITs sub-
mitted by that worker. Providers can require that a
worker’s approval rating be above a certain threshold
before allowing that worker to submit one of his/her
HITs. Country of residence and lifetime approved
number of HITs completed also serve as built-in
qualifications that providers may check before al-
lowing workers to access their HITs.2 Amazon also
allows providers to define their own qualifications.
Typically, provider-defined qualifications are used to
ensure that HITs which require particular skills are
only completed by qualified workers. In most cases,
workers acquire provider-defined qualifications by
completing an online test.
Amazon also provides a mechanism by which
multiple unique workers can complete the same HIT.
The number of times a HIT is to be completed is
known as the number of assignments for the HIT.
By having multiple workers complete the same HIT,

2According to the terms of use, workers are prohibited from
having more than one account, but to the writer’s knowledge
there is no method in place to enforce this restriction. Thus,
a worker with a poor approval rating could simply create a
new account, since all accounts start with an approval rating
of 100%.

3 Word Sense Subjectivity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943263157895">
(Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) define subjective ex-
pressions as words and phrases being used to ex-
press mental and emotional states, such as specula-
tions, evaluations, sentiments, and beliefs. Many ap-
proaches to sentiment and subjectivity analysis rely
on lexicons of such words (subjectivity clues). How-
ever, such clues often have both subjective and ob-
jective senses, as illustrated by (Wiebe and Mihal-
cea, 2006). Figure 1 provides subjective and objec-
tive examples of senses.
(Akkaya et al., 2009) points out that most sub-
jectivity lexicons are compiled as lists of keywords,
rather than word meanings (senses). Thus, subjec-
tivity clues used with objective senses – false hits –
are a significant source of error in subjectivity and
sentiment analysis. SWSD specifically deals with
this source of errors. (Akkaya et al., 2009) shows
that SWSD helps with various subjectivity and sen-
timent analysis systems by ignoring false hits.

4 Annotation Task

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999763">
4.1 Subjectivity Word Sense Disambiguation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968121951219">
Our target task is Subjectivity Word Sense Disam-
biguation (SWSD). SWSD aims to determine which
word instances in a corpus are being used with sub-
jective senses and which are being used with ob-
jective senses. It can be considered to be a coarse-
grained application-specific WSD that distinguishes
between only two senses: (1) the subjective sense
and (2) the objective sense.
Subjectivity word sense annotation is done in the
following way. We try to keep the annotation task
for the worker as simple as possible. Thus, we do
not directly ask them if the instance of a target word
has a subjective or an objective sense (without any
sense inventory), because the concept of subjectivity
is fairly difficult to explain to someone who does not
have any linguistics background. Instead we show
MTurk workers two sets of senses – one subjective
set and one objective set – for a specific target word
and a text passage in which the target word appears.
Their job is to select the set that best reflects the
meaning of the target word in the text passage. The
specific sense set automatically gives us the subjec-
tivity label of the instance. This makes the annota-
tion task easier for them as (Snow et al., 2008) shows
that WSD can be done reliably by MTurk workers.
This approach presupposes a set of word senses that
have been annotated as subjective or objective. The
annotation of senses in a dictionary for subjectivity
is not difficult for an expert annotator. Moreover,
it needs to be done only once per target word, al-
lowing us to collect hundreds of subjectivity labeled
instances for each target word through MTurk.
In this annotation task, we do not inform the
MTurk workers about the nature of the sets. This
means the MTurk workers have no idea that they are
annotating subjectivity of senses; they are just se-
lecting the set which contains a sense matching the
usage in the sentence or being as similar to it as pos-
sible. This ensures that MTurk workers are not bi-
ased by the contextual subjectivity of the sentence
while tagging the target word instance.

Below, we describe a sample annotation problem.
An MTurk worker has access to the following two
sense sets of the target word “appear”, as seen in
Figure 2. The information that the first sense set is
subjective and second sense set is objective is not
available to the worker. The worker is presented
with the following text passage holding the target
word “appear”.
It’s got so bad that I don’t even know what
to say. Charles Itargetl appeared Itargetl
somewhat embarrassed by his own behav-
ior. The hidden speech was coming, I
could tell.
In this passage, the MTurk worker should be able
to understand that “appeared” refers to the outward
impression given by “Charles”. This use of appear is
most similar to the first entry in sense set one; thus,
the correct answer for this problem is Sense Set-1.

4.2 Gold Standard
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999265625">
The gold standard dataset, on which we evaluate
MTurk worker annotations, is provided by (Akkaya
et al., 2009). This dataset (called subjSENSEVAL)
consists of target word instances in a corpus labeled
as S or O, indicating whether they are used with
a subjective or objective sense. It is based on the
lexical sample corpora from SENSEVAL1 (Kilgar-
riff and Palmer, 2000), SENSEVAL2 (Preiss and
Yarowsky, 2001), and SENSEVAL3 (Mihalcea and
Edmonds, 2004). SubjSENSEVAL consists of in-
stances for 39 ambiguous (having both subjective
and objective meanings) target words.
(Akkaya et al., 2009) also provided us with sub-
jectivity labels for word senses which are used in the
creation of subjSENSEVAL. Sense labels of the tar-
get word senses are defined on the sense inventory
of the underlying corpus (Hector for SENSEVAL1;
WordNet1.7 for SENSEVAL2; and WordNet1.7.1
for SENSEVAL3). This means the target words
from SENSEVAL1 have their senses annotated in
the Hector dictionary, while the target words from
SENSEVAL2 and SENSEVAL3 have their senses
annotated in WordNet1.7. We make use of these la-
beled sense inventories to build our subjective and
objective sets of senses, which we present to the
MTurk worker as Sense Set1 and Sense Set2 re-
spectively. We want to have a uniform sense rep-
resentation for the words we ask subjectivity sense
labels for. Thus, we consider only SENSEVAL2 and
SENSEVAL3 subsets of subjSENSEVAL, because
SENSEVAL1 relies on a sense inventory other than
WordNet.

5 Experimental Design
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993">
We chose randomly 8 target words that have a distri-
bution of subjective and objective instances in sub-
jSENSEVAL with less skew than 75%. That is, no
more than 75% of a word’s senses are subjective or
objective. Our concern is that using skewed data
might bias the workers to choose from the more fre-
quent label without thinking much about the prob-
lem. Another important fact is that these words with
low skew are more ambiguous and responsible for
more false hits. Thus, these target words are the ones
for which we really need subjectivity word sense
disambiguation. For each of these 8 target words, we
select 40 passages from subjSENSEVAL in which
the target word appears, to include in our experi-
ments. Table 1 summarizes the selected target words

and their label distribution. In this table, frequent la-
bel percentage (FLP) represents the skew for each
word. A word’s FLP is equal to the percent of the
senses that are of the most frequently occurring type
of sense (subjective or objective) for that word.
We believe this annotation task is a good candi-
date for attracting spammers. This task requires only
binary annotations, where the worker just chooses
from one of the two given sets, which is not a dif-
ficult task. Since it is easy to provide labels, we
believe that there will be a distinct line, with re-
spect to quality of annotations, between spammers
and mediocre annotators.
For our experiments, we created three different
HIT groups each having different qualification re-
quirements but sharing the same data. To be con-
crete, each HIT group consists of the same 320 in-
stances: 40 instances for each target word listed in
Table 1. Each HIT presents an MTurk worker with
four instances of the same word in a text passage
– this makes 80 HITs for each HIT group – and
asks him to choose the set to which the activated
sense belongs. We know for each HIT the mapping
between sense set numbers and subjectivity. Thus,
we can evaluate each HIT response on our gold-
standard data, as discussed in Section 4.2. We pay
seven cents per HIT. We consider this to be generous
compensation for such a simple task.
There are many builtin qualifications in MTurk.
We concentrated only on three of them: location,
HIT approval rate, and approved HITs, as discussed
in Section 2. In our experience, these qualifications
are widely used for quality assurance. As mentioned
before, we created three different HIT groups in or-
der to see how well different built-in qualification
combinations do with respect to filtering spammers.
These groups – starting from the least constrained to
the most constrained – are listed in Table 2.
Group1 required only that the MTurk workers are
located in the US. This group is the least constrained
one. Group2 additionally required an approval rate
greater than 96%. Group3 is the most constrained
one, requiring a lifetime approved HIT number to
be greater than 500, in addition to the qualifications
in Group1 and Group2.
We believe that neither location nor approval rate
and location together is enough to avoid spammers.
While being a US resident does to some extent guar-
antee English proficiency, it does not guarantee well-
thought answers. Since there is no mechanism in
place preventing users from creating new MTurk
worker accounts at will and since all worker ac-
counts are initialized with a 100% approval rate, we
do not think that approval rate is sufficient to avoid
serial spammers and other poor annotators. We hy-
pothesize that the workers with high approval rate
and a large number of approved HITs have a reputa-
tion to maintain, and thus will probably be careful in
their answers. We think it is unlikely that spammers
will have both a high approval rate and a large num-
ber of completed HITs. Thus, we anticipated that
Group3’s annotations will be of higher quality than
those of the other groups.
Note that an MTurk worker who has access to the
HITs in one of the HIT groups also has access to
HITs in less constrained groups. For example, an
MTurk worker who has access to HITs in Group3
also has access to HITs in Group2 and Group1. We
did not prevent MTurk workers from working in
multiple HIT groups because we did not want to
influence worker behavior, but instead simulate the
most realistic annotation scenario.
In addition to the qualifications described above,
we also required each worker to take a qualification
test in order to prove their competence in the anno-
tation task. The qualification test consists of 10 sim-

ple annotation questions identical in form to those
present in the HITs. These questions are split evenly
between two target words, “appear” and “restraint”.
There are a total of five subjective and five objective
usages in the test. We required an accuracy of 90%
in the qualification test, corresponding to a Kappa
score of .80, before a worker was allowed to submit
any of our HITs. If a worker failed to achieve a score
of 90% on an attempt, that worker could try the test
again after a delay of 4 hours.
We collected three sets of assignments within
each HIT group. In other words, each HIT was com-
pleted three times by three different workers in each
group. This gives us a total of 960 assignments in
each HIT group. A total of 26 unique workers par-
ticipated in the experiment: 17 in Group1, 17 in
Group2 and 8 in Group3. As mentioned before, a
worker is able to participate in all the groups for
which he is qualified. Thus the unique worker num-
bers in each group does not sum up to the total num-
ber of workers in the experiment, since some work-
ers participated in the HITs for more than one group.

between groups.

<bodyText confidence="0.999980705882353">
As mentioned in the previous section, we collect
three annotations for each HIT. They are assigned to
respective trials in the order submitted by the work-
ers. The results are summarized in Table 3. Trials
are labeled as TX and MV is the majority vote an-
notation among the three trials. The final column
contains the baseline agreement where a worker la-
bels each instance of a word with the most frequent
label of that word in the gold-standard data. It is
clear from this table that, since worker accuracy
always exceeds the baseline agreement, subjectiv-
ity word sense annotation can be done reliably by
MTurk workers. This is very promising. Consid-
ering the low cost and low time required to obtain
MTurk annotations, a large scale SWSD is realis-
tic. For example, (Akkaya et al., 2009) shows that
the most frequent 80 lexicon keywords are respon-
sible for almost half of the false hits in the MPQA
Corpus3 (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson, 2008), a cor-
pus annotated for subjective expressions. Utilizing
MTurk to collect training data for these 80 lexicon
keywords will be quick and cheap and most impor-
tantly reliable.
When we compare groups with each other, we
see that the best trial result is achieved in Group3.
However, according to McNemar’s test (Dietterich,
1998), there is no statistically significant difference
between any trial of any group. On the other hand,
the best majority vote annotation is achieved in
Group2, but again there is no statistically significant
difference between any majority vote annotation of
any group. These results are surprising to us, since
we do not see any significant difference in the qual-
ity of the data throughout different groups.

large margin beyond a certain threshold will be con-
sidered to be spammers. As discussed in Section 5,
we require all participating workers to pass a quali-
fication test before answering HITs. Thus, we know
that they are competent to do subjectivity sense an-
notations, and providing consistently erroneous an-
notations means that they are probably spammers.
We think a kappa score of 0.6 is a good threshold
to distinguish spammers from well-meaning work-
ers. For this threshold, we had 2 spammers par-
ticipating in Group1, 2 spammers in Group2 and
0 spammers in Group3. Table 4 presents spammer
count and spammer percentage in each group for
various threshold values. We see that Group3 has
consistently fewer spammers and a smaller spammer
percentage. The lowest kappa scores for Group1,
Group2, and Group3 are .35, .40, and .69, respec-
tively. The mean kappa scores for Group1, Group2,
and Group3 are .73, .75, and .77, respectively.
These results indicate that Group3 is less prone
to spammers, apparently contradicting Section 6.1.
We see the reason when we inspect the data more
closely. It turns out that spammers contributed in
Group1 and Group2 only minimally. On the other
hand there are two mediocre workers (Kappa of
0.69) who submit around 1/3 of the HITs in Group3.
This behavior might be a coincidence. In the face of
contradicting results, we think that we need a more
extensive study to derive conclusions about the rela-
tion between spammer distribution and built-in qual-
ification.

6.3 Learning Effect
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999255518518519">
Expert annotators can learn to provide more accu-
rate annotations over time. (Passonneau et al., 2006)
reports a learning effect early in the annotation pro-
cess. This might be due to the formal and informal
interaction between annotators. Another possibility
is that the annotators might get used to the annota-
tion task over time. This is to be expected if there is
not an extensive training process before the annota-
tion takes place.
On the other hand, the MTurk workers have no
interaction among themselves. They do not receive
any formal training and do not have access to true
annotations except a few examples if provided by
the requester. These properties make MTurk work-
ers a unique annotation workforce. We are interested
if the learning effect common to expert annotators
holds in this unique workforce in the absence of any
interaction and feedback. That may justify working
with the same set of workers over a long time by
creating private groups of workers.
We sort annotations of a worker after the submis-
sion date. This way, we get for each worker an or-
dered list of annotations. We split the list into bins
of size 40 and we test for an increasing trend in
the proportion of successes over time. We use the
Chi-squared Test for binomial proportions (Rosner,
2006). Using this test, we find that all of the p-values

are substantially larger than 0.05. Thus, there is no
increasing trend in the proportion of successes and
no learning effect. This is true for both mediocre
workers and very reliable workers. We think that the
results may differ for harder annotation tasks where
the input is more complex and requires some adjust-
ment.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999825">
There has been recently an increasing interest in
Amazon Mechanical Turk. Many researchers have
utilized MTurk as a source of non-expert natural
language annotation to create labeled datasets. In
(Mrozinski et al., 2008), MTurk workers are used to
create a corpus of why-questions and corresponding
answers on which QA systems may be developed.
(Kaisser and Lowe, 2008) work on a similar task.
They make use of MTurk workers to identify sen-
tences in documents as answers and create a corpus
of question-answer sentence pairs. MTurk is also
considered in other fields than natural language pro-
cessing. For example, (Sorokin and Forsyth, 2008)
utilizes MTurk for image labeling. Our ultimate goal
is similar; namely, to build training data (in our case
for SWSD).
Several studies have concentrated specifically on
the quality aspect of the MTurk annotations. They
investigated methods to assess annotation quality
and to aggregate multiple noisy annotations for high
reliability. (Snow et al., 2008) report MTurk an-
notation quality on various NLP tasks (e.g. WSD,
Textual Entailment, Word Similarity) and define
a bias correction method for non-expert annota-
tors. (Callison-Burch, 2009) uses MTurk workers
for manual evaluation of automatic translation qual-
ity and experiments with weighed voting to com-
bine multiple annotations. (Hsueh et al., 2009) de-
fine various annotation quality measures and show
that they are useful for selecting annotations leading
to more accurate classifiers. Our work investigates
the effect of built-in qualifications on the quality of
MTurk annotations.
(Hsueh et al., 2009) applies MTurk to get senti-
ment annotations on political blog snippets. (Snow
et al., 2008) utilizes MTurk for affective text annota-
tion task. In both works, MTurk workers annotated
larger entities but on a more detailed scale than we
do. (Snow et al., 2008) also provides a WSD anno-
tation task which is similar to our annotation task.
The difference is the MTurk workers are choosing
an exact sense not a sense set.

8 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971764705882">
In this paper, we address the question of whether
built-in qualifications are enough to avoid spam-
mers. The investigation of worker performances
indicates that the lesser constrained a group is the
more spammers it attracts. On the other hand, we did
not find any significant difference between the qual-
ity of the annotations for each group. It turns out that
workers considered as spammers contributed only
minimally. We do not know if it is just a coincidence
or if it is correlated to the task definition. We did not
get conclusive results. We need to do more extensive
experiments before arriving at conclusions.
Another aspect we investigated is the learning ef-
fect. Our results show that there is no improvement
in annotator reliability over time. We should not ex-
pect MTurk workers to provide more consistent an-
notations over time. This will probably be the case
in similar annotation tasks. For harder annotation
tasks (e.g. parse tree annotation) things may be dif-
ferent. An interesting follow-up would be whether
showing the answers of other workers on the same
HIT will promote learning.
We presented our subjectivity sense annotation
task to the worker in a very simple way. The an-
notation results prove that subjectivity word sense
annotation can be done reliably by MTurk workers.
This is very promising since the MTurk annotations
can be collected for low costs in a short time pe-
riod. This implies that a large scale general SWSD
component, which can help with various subjectivity
and sentiment analysis tasks, is feasible. We plan to
work with selected workers to collect new annotated
data for SWSD and use this data to train a SWSD
system.

<abstract confidence="0.999416">Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a marketplace for so-called “human intelligence tasks” (HITs), or tasks that are easy for humans but currently difficult for automated processes. Providers upload tasks to MTurk which workers then complete. Natural language annotation is one such human intelligence task. In this paper, we investigate using MTurk to collect annotations for Subjectivity Word Sense Disambiguation (SWSD), a coarse-grained word sense disambiguation task. We investigate whether we can use MTurk to acquire good annotations with respect to gold-standard data, whether we can filter out low-quality workers (spammers), and whether there is a learning effect associated with repeatedly completing the same kind of task. While our results with respect to spammers are inconclusive, we are able to obtain high-quality annotations for the SWSD task. These results suggest a greater role for MTurk with respect to constructing a large scale SWSD system in the future, promising substantial improvement in subjectivity and sentiment analysis.</abstract>

For example, (Ng, 1997) estimates an effort of 16 person years to construct training data for a highaccuracy domain independent Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system. Recently researchers have been investigating Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) as a source of non-expert natural language annotation, which is a cheap and quick alternative to expert annotations (Kaisser and Lowe, 2008; Mrozinski et al., 2008). In this paper, we utilize MTurk to obtain training data for Subjectivity Word Sense Disambiguation (SWSD) as described in (Akkaya et al., 2009). The goal of SWSD is to automatically determine which word instances in a corpus are being used with subjective senses, and which are being used with objective senses. SWSD is a new task which suffers from the absence of a substantial amount of annotated data and thus can only be applied on a small scale. SWSD has strong connections to WSD. Like supervised WSD, it requires training data where target word instances – words which need to be disambiguated by the system – are labeled as having an objective sense or a subjective sense. (Akkaya et al., 2009) show that SWSD may bring substantial imp</context>

Many approaches to sentiment and subjectivity analysis rely on lexicons of such words (subjectivity clues). However, such clues often have both subjective and objective senses, as illustrated by (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006). Figure 1 provides subjective and objective examples of senses. (Akkaya et al., 2009) points out that most subjectivity lexicons are compiled as lists of keywords, rather than word meanings (senses). Thus, subjectivity clues used with objective senses – false hits – are a significant source of error in subjectivity and sentiment analysis. SWSD specifically deals with this source of errors. (Akkaya et al., 2009) shows that SWSD helps with various subjectivity and sentiment analysis systems by ignoring false hits. 4 Annotation Task 4.1 Subjectivity Word Sense Disambiguation Our target task is Subjectivity Word Sense Disambiguation (SWSD). SWSD aims to determine which word instan</context>

It’s got so bad that I don’t even know what to say. Charles Itargetl appeared Itargetl somewhat embarrassed by his own behavior. The hidden speech was coming, I could tell. In this passage, the MTurk worker should be able to understand that “appeared” refers to the outward impression given by “Charles”. This use of appear is most similar to the first entry in sense set one; thus, the correct answer for this problem is Sense Set-1. 4.2 Gold Standard The gold standard dataset, on which we evaluate MTurk worker annotations, is provided by (Akkaya et al., 2009). This dataset (called subjSENSEVAL) consists of target word instances in a corpus labeled as S or O, indicating whether they are used with a subjective or objective sense. It is based on the lexical sample corpora from SENSEVAL1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000), SENSEVAL2 (Preiss and Yarowsky, 2001), and SENSEVAL3 (Mihalcea and Edmonds, 2004). SubjSENSEVAL consists of instances for 39 ambiguous (having both subjective and objective meanings) target words. (Akkaya et al., 2009) also provided us with subjectivity labels for word senses which are used in the creation of subjSENSEVAL. Sense labels o</context>

Trials are labeled as TX and MV is the majority vote annotation among the three trials. The final column contains the baseline agreement where a worker labels each instance of a word with the most frequent label of that word in the gold-standard data. It is clear from this table that, since worker accuracy always exceeds the baseline agreement, subjectivity word sense annotation can be done reliably by MTurk workers. This is very promising. Considering the low cost and low time required to obtain MTurk annotations, a large scale SWSD is realistic. For example, (Akkaya et al., 2009) shows that the most frequent 80 lexicon keywords are responsible for almost half of the false hits in the MPQA Corpus3 (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson, 2008), a corpus annotated for subjective expressions. Utilizing MTurk to collect training data for these 80 lexicon keywords will be quick and cheap and most importantly reliable. When we compare groups with each other, we see that the best trial result is achieved in Group3. However, according to McNemar’s test (Dietterich, 1998), there is no statistically significant difference between any trial of any group. On the other hand, the best majority</context>

The good news is that training data for 80 selected keywords is enough to make a substantial difference (Akkaya et al., 2009). Thus, large scale SWSD is feasible. We hypothesize that annotations for SWSD can be provided by non-experts reliably if the annotation task is presented in a simple way. The annotations obtained from MTurk workers are noisy by nature, because MTurk workers are not trained for the underlying annotation task. That is why previous work explored methods to assess annotation quality and to aggregate multiple noisy annotations for high reliability (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009). It is understandable that not every worker will provide high-quality annotations, 195 Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2010 Workshop on Creating Speech and Language Data with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, pages 195–203, Los Angeles, California, June 2010. c�2010 Association for Computational Linguistics depending on their background and interest.

The annotation process to obtain this data is very laborious and expensive. This makes supervised NLP systems subject to a so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck. For example, (Ng, 1997) estimates an effort of 16 person years to construct training data for a highaccuracy domain independent Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system.

We see the reason when we inspect the data more closely. It turns out that spammers contributed in Group1 and Group2 only minimally. On the other hand there are two mediocre workers (Kappa of 0.69) who submit around 1/3 of the HITs in Group3. This behavior might be a coincidence. In the face of contradicting results, we think that we need a more extensive study to derive conclusions about the relation between spammer distribution and built-in qualification. 6.3 Learning Effect Expert annotators can learn to provide more accurate annotations over time. (Passonneau et al., 2006) reports a learning effect early in the annotation process. This might be due to the formal and informal interaction between annotators. Another possibility is that the annotators might get used to the annotation task over time. This is to be expected if there is not an extensive training process before the annotation takes place. On the other hand, the MTurk workers have no interaction among themselves. They do not receive any formal training and do not have access to true annotations except a few examples if provided by the requester. These properties make MTurk workers a unique annotation w</context>

We are interested if the learning effect common to expert annotators holds in this unique workforce in the absence of any interaction and feedback. That may justify working with the same set of workers over a long time by creating private groups of workers. We sort annotations of a worker after the submission date. This way, we get for each worker an ordered list of annotations. We split the list into bins of size 40 and we test for an increasing trend in the proportion of successes over time. We use the Chi-squared Test for binomial proportions (Rosner, 2006). Using this test, we find that all of the p-values 201 are substantially larger than 0.05. Thus, there is no increasing trend in the proportion of successes and no learning effect. This is true for both mediocre workers and very reliable workers.
