Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999881571428571">
The quality of automatic translation is af-
fected by many factors. One is the diver-
gence between the specific source and tar-
get languages. Another lies in the source
text itself, as some texts are more com-
plex than others. One way to handle such
texts is to modify them prior to transla-
tion. Yet, an important factor that is of-
ten overlooked is the source translatabil-
ity with respect to the specific translation
system and the specific model that are be-
ing used. In this paper we present an in-
teractive system where source modifica-
tions are induced by confidence estimates
that are derived from the translation model
in use. Modifications are automatically
generated and proposed for the user’s ap-
proval. Such a system can reduce post-
editing effort, replacing it by cost-effective
pre-editing that can be done by monolin-
guals.

While Machine Translation (MT) systems are con-
stantly improving, they are still facing many dif-
ficulties, such as out-of-vocabulary words (i.e.
words unseen at training time), lack of sufficient
in-domain data, ambiguities that the MT model
cannot resolve, and the like. An important source
of problems lies in the source text itself – some
texts are more complex to translate than others.
Consider the following English-to-French
translation by a popular service, BING TRANS-
LATOR:1 Head of Mali defense seeks more arms
→ Défense de la tête du Mali cherche bras plus.
There, apart from syntactic problems, both head
and arms have been translated as if they were

body parts (tête and bras). However, suppose
that we express the same English meaning in the
following way: Chief of Mali defense wants more
weapons. Then BING produces a much better
translation: Chef d’état-major de la défense du
Mali veut plus d’armes.
The fact that the formulation of the source can
strongly influence the quality of the translation has
long been known, and there have been studies in-
dicating that adherence to so-called “Controlled
Language” guidelines, such as Simplified Techni-
cal English2 can reduce the MT post-edition ef-
fort. However, as one such study (O’Brien, 2006)
notes, it is unfortunately not sufficient to just “ap-
ply the rules [i.e. guidelines] and press Translate.
We need to analyze the effect that rules are hav-
ing on different language pairs and MT systems,
and we need to tune our rule sets and texts ac-
cordingly”.
In the software system presented here, SORT
(SOurce Rewriting Tool), we build on the basic in-
sight that formulation of the source needs to be
geared to the specific MT model being used, and
propose the following approach. First, we assume
that the original source text in English (say) is not
necessarily under the user’s control, but may be
given to her. While she is a fluent English speaker,
she does not know at all the target language, but
uses an MT system; crucially, this system is able
to provide estimates of the quality of its transla-
tions (Specia et al., 2009). SORT then automati-
cally produces a number of rewritings of each En-
glish sentence, translates them with the MT sys-
tem, and displays to the user those rewritings for
which the translation quality estimates are higher
than the estimate for the original source. The user
then interactively selects one such rewriting per
sentence, checking that it does not distort the orig-
inal meaning, and finally the translations of these

reformulations are made available.
One advantage of this framework is that the
proposed rewritings are implicitly “aware” of the
underlying strengths and limitations of the spe-
cific MT model. A good quality estimation3
component, for instance, will feel more confident
about the translation of an unambiguous word like
weapon than about that of an ambiguous one such
as arm, or about the translation of a known term
in its domain than about a term not seen during
training.
Such a tool is especially relevant for business
situations where post-edition costs are very high,
for instance because of lack of people both ex-
pert in the domain and competent in the target lan-
guage. Post-edition must be reserved for the most
difficult cases, while pre-edition may be easier to
organize. While the setup cannot fully guarantee
the accuracy of all translations, it can reduce the
number of sentences that need to go through post-
edition and the overall cost of this task.

2 The rewriting tool
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999767962962963">
In this section we describe SORT, our implemen-
tation of the aforementioned rewriting approach.
While the entire process can in principle be fully
automated, we focus here on an interactive pro-
cess where the user views and approves suggested
rewritings. The details of the rewriting methods
and of the quality estimation used in the current
implementation are described in Sections 3 and 4.
Figure 1 presents the system’s interface, which
is accessed as a web application. With this in-
terface, the user uploads the document that needs
to be translated. The translation confidence of
each sentence is computed and displayed next to
it. The confidence scores are color-coded to en-
able quickly focusing on the sentences that require
more attention. Green denotes sentences for which
the translation confidence is high, and are thus ex-
pected to produce good translations. Red marks
sentences that are estimated to be poorly trans-
lated, and all those in between are marked with
an orange label.
We attempt to suggest rewritings only for sen-
tences that are estimated to be not so well trans-
lated. When we are able to propose rewriting(s)
with higher translation confidence than the origi-
nal, a magnifying glass icon is displayed next to the
sentence. Clicking it displays, on the right side of

the screen, an ordered list of the more confident
rewritings, along with their corresponding confi-
dence estimations. The first sentence on the list
is always the original one, to let it be edited, and
to make it easier to view the difference between
the original and the rewritings. An example is
shown on the right side of Figure 1, where we see
a rewriting suggestion for the fourth sentence in
the document. Here, the suggestion is simply to
replace the word captured with the word caught, a
rewriting that is estimated to improve the transla-
tion of the sentence.
The user can select one of the suggestions or
choose to edit either the original or one of the
rewritings. The current sentence which is being
examined is marked with a different color and the
alternative under focus is marked with a small icon
(the bidirectional arrows). The differences between
the alternatives and the original are highlighted.
After the user’s confirmation (with the check mark
icon), the display of the document on the left-hand
side is updated based on her selection, including
the updated confidence estimation. At any time,
the user (if she speaks the target language) can
click on the cogwheel icon and view the transla-
tion of the source or of its rewritten version. When
done, the user can save the edited text or its trans-
lation. Moses Release 1.0 of an English-Spanish
Europarl-trained model4 was used in this work to
obtain English-Spanish translations.

2.1 System and software architecture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996672222222222">
SORT is implemented as a web application, using
an MVC (Model View Controller) software archi-
tecture. The Model part is formed by Java classes
representing the application state (user input, se-
lected text lines, associated rewriting propositions
and scores). The Controller consists of several
servlet components handling each user interaction
with the backend server (file uploads, SMT tools
calls via XML-RPC or use of the embedded Java
library that handles the actual rewritings). Finally,
the View is built with standard web technologies:
HTML5, JavaScript (AJAX) and CSS style sheets.
The application was developed and deployed on
Linux (CentOS release 6.4), with a Java Runtime
6 (Java HotSpot 64-Bit Server VM), within a Tom-
cat 7.0 Application Server, and tested with Firefox
as the web client both on Linux and Windows 7.
Figure 2 shows the system architecture of SORT,

with some details of the current implementation.
The entire process is performed via a client-server
architecture in order to provide responsiveness, as
required in an interactive system. The user com-
municates with the system through the interface
shown in Figure 1. When a document is loaded,
its sentences are translated in parallel by an SMT
Moses server (Koehn et al., 2007). Then, the
source and the target are sent to the confidence es-
timator, and the translation model information is
also made available to it. The confidence estima-
tor extracts features from that input and returns a
confidence score. Specifically, the language model
features are computed with two SRILM servers
(Stolcke, 2002), one for the source language and
one for the target language. Rewritings are pro-
duced by the rewriting modules (see Section 3 for
the implemented rewriting methods). For each
rewriting, the same process of translation and con-
fidence estimation is performed. Translations are
cached during the session; thus, when the user
wishes to view a translation or download the trans-
lations of the entire document, the response is im-
mediate.

3 Source rewriting
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967421052632">
Various methods can be used to rewrite a source
text. In what follows we describe two rewriting
methods, based on Text Simplification techniques,
which we implemented and integrated in the cur-
rent version of SORT. Simplification operations
include the replacement of words by simpler ones,
removal of complicated syntactic structures, short-
ening of sentences etc. (Feng, 2008). Our assump-
tion is that simpler sentences are more likely to
yield higher quality translations. Clearly, this is
not always the case; yet, we leave this decision to
the confidence estimation component.
Sentence-level simplification (Specia, 2010)
has proposed to model text simplification as a Sta-
tistical Machine Translation (SMT) task where the
goal is to translate sentences to their simplified
version in the same language. In this approach, a
simplification model is learnt from a parallel cor-
pus of texts and their simplified versions. Apply-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999890222222222">
ing this method, we train an SMT model from En-
glish to Simple English, based on the PWKP par-
allel corpus generated from Wikipedia (Zhu et al.,
2010);5 we use only alignments involving a single
sentence on each side. This results in a phrase ta-
ble containing many entries where source and tar-
get phrases are identical, but also phrase-pairs that
are mapping complex phrases to their simplified
counterparts, such as the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9997475">
• due to its location on → because it was on
• primarily dry and secondarily cold → both
cold and dry
• the high mountainous alps → the alps
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955303030303">
Also, the language model is trained with Simple
English sentences to encourage the generation of
simpler texts. Given a source text, it is translated
to its simpler version, and its n-best translations
are assessed by the confidence estimation compo-
nent.
Lexical simplification One of the primary oper-
ations for text-simplification is lexical substitution
(Table 2 in (Specia, 2010)). Hence, in addition to
rewriting a full sentence using the previous tech-
nique, we implemented a second method, address-
ing lexical simplification directly, and only modi-
fying local aspects of the source sentence. The ap-
proach here is to extract relevant synonyms from
our trained SMT model of English to Simplified
English, and use them as substitutions to simplify
new sentences. We extract all single token map-
pings from the phrase table of the trained model,
removing punctuations, numbers and stop-words.
We check whether their lemmas were synonyms
in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) (with all possible
parts-of-speech as this information was not avail-
able in the SMT model). Only those are left as
valid substitution pairs. When a match of an En-
glish word is found in the source sentence it is re-
placed with its simpler synonym to generate an al-
ternative for the source. For example, using this
rewriting method for the source sentence “Why the
Galileo research program superseded rival pro-
grams,” three rewritings of the sentence are gen-
erated when rival is substituted by competitor or
superseded by replaced, and when both substitu-
tions occur together.

4 Confidence estimation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999822407407407">
Our confidence estimator is based on the system
and data provided for the 2012 Quality estima-
tion shared task (Callison-Burch et al., 2012). In
this task, participants were required to estimate the
quality of automated translations. Their estimates
were compared to human scores of the translation
which referred to the suitability of the translation
for post-editing. The scores ranged from 1 to 5,
where 1 corresponded to translation that practi-
cally needs to be done from scratch, and 5 to trans-
lations that requires little to no editing.
The task’s training set consisted of approxi-
mately 1800 source sentences in English, their
Moses translations to Spanish and the scores given
to the translations by the three judges. With this
data we trained an SVM regression model using
SVMlight (Joachims, 1999). Features were ex-
tracted with the task’s feature-extraction baseline
module. Two types of features are used in this
module (i) black-box features, which do not as-
sume access to the translation system, such as
the length of the source and the target, number
of punctuation marks and language model prob-
abilities, and (ii) glass-box features, which are ex-
tracted from the translation model, such as the
average number of translations per source word
(Specia et al., 2009).

We performed an initial evaluation of our ap-
proach in an English to Spanish translation setting,
using the 2008 News Commentary data.6 First,
two annotators who speak English but not Spanish
used SORT to rewrite an English text. They re-
viewed the proposed rewritings for 960 sentences
and were instructed to “trust the judgment” of the
confidence estimator; that is, reviewing the sug-
gestions from the most to the least confident one,
they accepted the first rewriting that was fluent and
preserved the meaning of the source document as
a whole. 440 pairs of the original sentence and
the selected alternative were then both translated
to Spanish and were presented as competitors to

three native Spanish speakers. The sentences were
placed within their context in the original docu-
ment, taken from the Spanish side of the corpus.
The order of presentation of the two competitors
was random. In this evaluation, the translation of
the original was preferred 20.6% of the cases, the
rewriting 30.4% of them, and for 49% of the sen-
tences, no clear winner was chosen.7 Among the
two rewriting methods, the sentence-level method
more often resulted in preferred translations.
These results suggest that rewriting is esti-
mated to improve translation quality. However,
the amount of preferred original translations indi-
cates that the confidence estimator is not always
discriminative enough: by construction, for every
rewriting that is displayed, the confidence compo-
nent estimates the translation of the original to be
less accurate than that of the rewriting; yet, this is
not always reflected in the preferences of the eval-
uators. On a different dimension than translation
quality, the large number of cases with no clear
winner, and the analysis we conducted, indicate
that the user’s cognitive effort would be decreased
if we only displayed those rewritings associated
with a substantial improvement in confidence; due
to the nature of our methods, frequently, identi-
cal or near-identical translations were generated,
with only marginal differences in confidence, e.g.,
when two source synonyms were translated to the
same target word. Also, often a wrong synonym
was suggested as a replacement for a word (e.g.
Christmas air for Christmas atmosphere). This
was somewhat surprising as we had expected the
language model features of the confidence estima-
tor to help removing these cases. While they were
filtered by the English-speaking users, and thus
did not present a problem for translation, they cre-
ated unnecessary workload. Putting more empha-
sis on context features in the confidence estimation
or explicitly verifying context-suitability of a lex-
ical substitutions could help addressing this issue.

Some related approaches focus on the authoring
process and control a priori the range of possible
texts, either by interactively enforcing lexical and
syntactic constraints on the source that simplify

ing a monolingual author in the generation of mul-
tilingual texts (Power and Scott, 1998; Dymetman
et al., 2000). A recent approach (Venkatapathy
and Mirkin, 2012) proposes an authoring tool that
consults the MT system itself to propose phrases
that should be used during composition to obtain
better translations. All these methods address the
authoring of the source text from scratch. This
is inherently different from the objective of our
work where an existing text is modified to improve
its translatability. Moving away from authoring
approaches, (Choumane et al., 2005) propose an
interactive system where the author helps a rule-
based translation system disambiguate a source
text inside a structured document editor. The
techniques are generic and are not automatically
adapted to a specific MT system or model. Closer
to our approach of modifying the source text, one
approach is to paraphrase the source or to gener-
ate sentences entailed by it (Callison-Burch et al.,
2006; Mirkin et al., 2009; Marton et al., 2009;
Aziz et al., 2010). These works, however, fo-
cus on handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words,
do not assess the translatability of the source sen-
tence and are not interactive.8 The MonoTrans2
project (Hu et al., 2011) proposes monolingual-
based editing for translation. Monolingual speak-
ers of the source and target language collaborate
to improve the translation. Unlike our approach,
here both the feedback for poorly translated sen-
tences and the actual modification of the source
is done by humans. This contrasts with the auto-
matic handling (albeit less accurate) of both these
tasks in our work.

We introduced a system for rewriting texts for
translation under the control of a confidence esti-
mator. While we focused on an interactive mode,
where a monolingual user is asked to check the
quality of the source reformulations, in an exten-
sion of this approach, the quality of the reformu-
lations could also be assessed automatically, re-
moving the interactive aspects at the cost of an in-
creased risk of rewriting errors. For future work
we wish to add more powerful rewriting tech-

possible reformulations, but compensate this ex-

on an evaluation of the quality of the generated al-
ternatives as well as on user selection decisions,
we may be able to learn a quality estimator for
the rewriting operations themselves. Such meth-
ods could be useful both in an interactive mode,
to minimize the effort of the monolingual source
user, as well as in an automatic mode, to avoid
misinterpretation. In this work we used an avail-
able baseline feature extraction module for confi-
dence estimation. A better estimator could bene-
fit our system significantly, as we argued above.
Lastly, we wish to further improve the user inter-
face of the tool, based on feedback from actual
users.

<abstract confidence="0.990226954545454">The quality of automatic translation is affected by many factors. One is the divergence between the specific source and target languages. Another lies in the source text itself, as some texts are more complex than others. One way to handle such texts is to modify them prior to translation. Yet, an important factor that is ofoverlooked is the source translatabilrespect to the specific translation system and the specific model that are being used. In this paper we present an interactive system where source modifications are induced by confidence estimates that are derived from the translation model in use. Modifications are automatically generated and proposed for the user’s approval. Such a system can reduce postediting effort, replacing it by cost-effective pre-editing that can be done by monolinguals.</abstract>
