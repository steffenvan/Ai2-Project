This study investigates similarity judg-
ments from two angles. First, we look at
models suggested in the psychology and
philosophy literature which capture the
essence of concept similarity evaluation
for humans. Second, we analyze the
properties of many metrics which simu-
late such evaluation capabilities. The first
angle reveals that non-experts can judge
similarity and that their judgments need
not be based on predefined traits. We use
such conclusions to inform us on how
gold standards for word sense disam-
biguation tasks could be established.
From the second angle, we conclude that
more attention should be paid to metric
properties before assigning them to per-
form a particular task.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937974358975">
The task of word sense disambiguation has
been at the heart of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) for many years. Recent Senseval compe-
titions (Mihalcea and Edmonds, 2004; Preiss and
Yarowsky, 2001) have stimulated the develop-
ment of algorithms to tackle different lexical dis-
ambiguation tasks. Such tasks require at their
core a judgment of similarity as a word’s multi-
ple definitions and its contexts of occurrences are
compared. Similarity judgment algorithms come
in many different forms. One angle of this arti-
cle is to analyze the assumptions behind such
similarity metrics by looking at different shared
or non-shared properties. Among the interesting
properties we note symmetry and transitivity,
which are fundamental to the understanding of
similarity. This angle is investigated in Section 4
and 5, looking respectively at two broad classes
of mathematical models of similarity and then
more closely at different similarity metrics.
As Senseval and other similar competitions
need a gold standard for evaluating the compet-
ing systems, the second angle of our research
looks into literature in philosophy and psychol-
ogy to gain insight on the human capability in
performing a similarity judgment. From the first
discipline explored in Section 2, we discover that
philosophers have divergent views on concept
identification, ranging from scientific definitions
to human perception of concepts. From the sec-
ond discipline, explored in Section 3, we dis-
cover different psychological models for concept
identification and implicitly concept comparison,
this time ranging from continuous concepts being
positioned in multi-dimensional spaces to con-
crete concepts being grasped as entities.
The two angles (metrics and humans) con-
verge in the conclusion of Section 6 with general
observations and future work.

Children have a natural eagerness to recognize
regularities in the world and to mimic the behav-
ior of competent members of their linguistic
community. It is in these words that Wittgenstein
(1980) simply expresses how infants acquire the
community’s language. What underlies the ac-
tivities surrounding a common use of language is
similar to our usage of words to express some-
thing: “Consider for example the proceedings
that we call games. I mean board-games, card-
games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on.
What is common to them all?” (Wittgenstein,
1968: 66). Wittgenstein answers that these ex-
pressions are characterized by similarities he
calls family resemblances.

Given that a dictionary’s purpose is to define
concepts, we could hope to see such family re-
semblances among its definitions. Contrarily to
this intuition, Table 1 shows definitions and ex-
amples for a few senses of game in Wordnet1,
from which resemblance cannot be found in
terms of common words in the definitions or ex-
amples. Nevertheless, humans are able to give
different judgments of similarity between differ-
ent senses of the word game. For example, simi-
larity between sense 1 and sense 3 is intuitively
larger than between sense 1 and sense 4.

Before being tempted to call up gigabytes of
corpus evidence data and computational strength
to help us identify the family of resemblance
emerging here, let us further look at the nature of
that notion from a philosophical point of view.
Possible senses of individual things could be
traced back to Aristotle’s work and identified
“without qualification” as the primary substance
of a thing (Cassam, 1986). What accounts for the
substance of an object, for Aristotle, was the
thing itself, namely its essence. Taking a slightly
different view on the notion of family of objects,
Putnam (1977) instead pursues a quest for natu-
ral kinds and according to him, the distinguish-
ing characteristics that “hold together” natural
kinds are the “core facts [...] conveying the use
of words of that kind” (Putnam, 1977: 118). Put-
nam disagrees with any analytical approaches
sustaining that the meaning of a word X is given
by a conjunction of properties P = {P1, P2,... Pn}
in such a way that P is the essence of X. The
problem is that a “natural kind may have abnor-
mal members” (Putnam, 1977: 103). For instance,
normal lemons have a yellow peel but let’s sup-
pose in accordance with Putnam, that a new en-
vironmental condition makes lemon peel become
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.654537">

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99953782">
blue. An analytical view will be unable to state
which one amongst the yellow or the blue ones is
now the normal member of the natural class of
lemons. Putnam rather relies on a “scientific the-
ory construction” to define what an object of
natural kind is, and therefore, does not see that
dictionaries “are cluttered up [...] with pieces of
empirical information” (Putnam, 1977: 118) as a
defect to convey core facts about a natural class.
In contrast to Putnam, Fodor (1998) is a viru-
lent opponent to a mind-independent similarity
semantics subject to scientific discoveries. With
his ostentatious doorknob example, Fodor shows
that there is not any natural kind, hidden essence
or peculiar structure that makes a doorknob a
doorknob. “No doubt, some engineer might con-
struct a counter-example–a mindless doorknob
detector; and we might even come to rely on
such a thing when groping for a doorknob in the
dark” (Fodor, 1998: 147). However, the con-
struct will have to be done on what strikes us as
doorknobhood or satisfying the doorknob stereo-
type, i.e. “the gadget would have to be calibrated
to us since there is nothing else in nature that
responds selectively to doorknobs” (Fodor, 1998:
147). According to Fodor, our capacity to ac-
quire the concept of doorknob involves a similar-
ity metric, and it is the human innate capacity to
determine the concepts similar to doorknob that
allow the characterization of doorknobhood.
Therefore, Fodor states that the meaning of con-
cepts is mind-dependent and that individuation is
not intractable since members of a language
community, although experiencing diverse forms
of a concept will tend to acquire similar stereo-
types of such a concept.
This brief exploration into philosophical ap-
proaches for concept representation and delimita-
tion can inform us on the establishment of a gold
standard by humans for the word sense disam-
biguation (WSD) task. In fact, the adherence to
one model rather than another has an impact on
who should be performing the evaluation2. Sen-
seval-2 was in line with Putnam’s view of ‘divi-
sion of linguistic labour’ by relying on lexicog-
raphers’ judgments to build a gold standard (Kil-
garrif, 1998). On the other hand, Senseval-3 col-
lected data via Open-Mind Initiative3, which was
much more in line with Fodor’s view that any
common people can use their own similarity

metric to disambiguate polysemous terms. Inter-
estingly, a recent empirical study (Murray and
Green 2004) showed how judgments by ordinary
people were consistent among themselves but
different from the one of lexicographers. It is
important to decide who the best judges are; a
decision which can certainly be based on the
foreseen application, but also, as we suggest here,
on some theoretical grounds.

We pursue our quest for insights in the
establishment of gold standards by humans for
the WSD task, now trying to answer the “how”
question rather then the “who” question. Indeed,
Fodor’s view might influence us in deciding that
non-experts can perform similarity judgments,
but this does not tell us how these judgments
should be performed. Different psychological
models will give possible answers. In fact,
similarity judgments have been largely studied
by experimental psychologists and distinctive
theories give some evidence about the existence
of a human internal cognitive mechanism for
such judgments. In this section, we present three
approaches: subjective scaling and objective
scaling (Voinov, 2002), and semantic differential
(Osgood et al. 1957).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999683">
3.1 Subjective Scaling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999485933333333">
In subjective scaling (Voinov, 2002), the
subjective human judgment is considered as a
convenient raw material to make comparison
between empirical studies of similarity. Subjects
are asked to point out the “similarities among n
objects of interest – whether concepts, persons,
traits, symptoms, cultures or species” (Shepard,
1974: 373). Then the similarity judgments are
represented in an n × n matrix of objects by a
multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the distance
between each object. Equation 1 shows the
evaluation of similarity, where d (xik, xjk) stands
for the distance between objects xi and xj on
stimulus (dimension) k and wk is the
psychological salience of that stimulus k:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9939492">
m
D xi xj
( , ) ( ( , ))
= wk d xik xjk . (1)
k=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993665">
Shepard’s MDS theory assumes that a
monotonic transformation should be done from a
nonmetric psychological salience of a stimulus to
a metric space model. By definition, the resulting
metric function over a set X should fullfill the
following conditions:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.612422">
∀x, y, z ∈ X:
</equation>
<listItem confidence="0.987953333333333">
1. d (x, y) ≥ d (x, x) = 0 (minimality),
2. d (x, y) = d (y, x) (symmetry),
3. d (x, y) ≥ d (x, z) + d (z, y) (triangle ineq.).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8776656">
Accordingly to Shepard (1974), the distance in
equation (1) can be computed with different
metrics. Some of these metrics are given in
Lebart and Rajman (2000). The Euclidean metric
is the best known:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.994063857142857">
Another yet is the Minkowski metric:

( )n

( xik xjk
− )
k 1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927583333333">
There is a main concern with the MDS model.
Tversky (1977) criticized the adequacy of the
metric distance functions as he showed that the
three conditions of minimality, symmetry and
triangle inequality are sometimes empirically
violated. For instance, Tversky and Gati showed
empirically that assessment of the similarity
between pairs of countries was asymetric when
they asked for “the degree to which Red China
is similar to North Korea” (1978: 87) and in the
reverse order, i.e. similarity between North
Korea and Red China.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99955">
3.2 Objective Scaling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989769230769">
The second approach is called objective scaling
by Voinov “though this term is not widely ac-
cepted” (Voinov, 2002). According to him, the
objectivity of the method comes from the fact
that similarity measures are calculated from the
ratio of objective features that describe objects
under analysis. So, subjects are asked to make
qualitative judgments on common or distinctive
features of objects and the comparison is then
made by any distance axioms. Tversky’s (1977)
contrast model (CM) is the best known formal-
ization of this approach. In his model, the meas-
ure of similarity is computed by:

where f (A B) represents a function of the
common features of both entities A and B,
f(A−B)is the function of the features belong-
ing to A but not B, f (B −A) is the function of
the features belonging to B but not A and
a, /3, x are their respective weighting parame-
ters. Equation (5) is the matching axiom of the
CM. A second fundamental property of that
model is given by the axiom of monotonicity:

two axioms (5-6), Tversky (1977) defined the
basis of what he called the matching function
using the theoretical notion of feature sets rather
then the geometric concept of similarity distance.
Interesting empirical studies followed this re-
search on CM and aimed at finding the correla-
tion between human judgments of similarity and
difference. Although some results show a corre-
lation between these judgments, there is limita-
tion to their complementarity: “the relative
weights of the common and distinctive features
vary with the nature of the task and support the
focusing hypothesis that people attend more to
the common features in judgments of similarity
than in judgments of the difference” (Tverski and
Gati, 1978: 84). Later on, Medin et al. (1990)
also reported cases when judgments of similarity
and difference are not inverses: first, when enti-
ties differ in their number of features, and second
when similarity/difference judgments involve
distinction of both attributes and relations. “Al-
though sameness judgments are typically de-
scribed as more global or non-analytic than dif-
ference judgments, an alternative possibility is
that they focus on relations rather than attributes”
(Medin et al., 1990: 68).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998369">
3.3 Semantic Differential
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993357142857">
One standard psycholinguistic method to
measure the similarity of meaning combines the
use of subjective scaling transposed in a
semantic space. One well-known method is
Semantic Differential (SD) developed by Osgood
et al. (1957).
The SD methodology measures the meanings
that individual subjects grant to words and
concepts according to a series of factor analyses.
These factor analyses are bipolar adjectives put
at each end of a Likert scale (Likert, 1932)
devised to rate the individual reaction to the
contrasted stimulus. For instance, the SD of a
concept can be rated with two stimuli of
goodness and temperature:
If the subject feels that the observed concept is
neutral with regards to the polar terms, his
check-mark should be at the position 0. In our
example, the mark on the good-bad scale being
at the 1 on the left side of the neutral point 0, the
judgment means slighthy good. Positions 2 and 3
on that same side would be respectively quite
good and extremely good. A similar analysis
applies for the cold-hot scale shown.
The theoretical background of that
methodology, which tries to standardize across
subjects the meaning of the same linguistic
stimulus, relies on psychological research on
synestesia. Simply explained, synestesia is
similar to a double reaction to a stimulus. For
example, when presented with images of
concepts, subjects do not only have a
spontaneous reaction to the images, but they are
also able to characterize the associated concept
in terms of almost any bipolar adjective pairs
(hot-cold, pleasant-unpleasant, simple-complex,
vague-precise, dull-sharp, static-dynamic, sweet-
bitter, emotional-rational, etc.). According to
Osgood et al. “the imagery found in synesthesia
is intimately tied up with language metaphor, and
both represent semantic relations” (1957: 23).
In SD, bipolar adjectives used in succession
can mediate a generalization to the meaning of a
sign, as uncertainty on each scale is reduced with
the successive process of elicitation. By
postulating representation in a semantic space,
each orthogonal axis of selection produces a
semantic differentiation when the subjects rate
the semantic alternatives on a bipolar scale.
Although that space could be multidimensional,
empirical studies (Osgood et al., 1957) on factor
analysis showed stability and relative importance
of three particular dimensions labeled as
Evaluation, Potency, and Activity (EPA). We
refer the reader to Osgood et al. (1957) for
further explanation on these EPA dimensions.

<bodyText confidence="0.99967597826087">
In Table 2, we show that both MDS (Shepard,
1974) and CM (Tversky, 1977) rely on a set of
predefined traits. This is a major problem, as it
leads to the necessity of defining in advance such
a set of traits on which to judge similarity be-
tween objects. On the other hand, SD (Osgood
et al. 1957), although using a few bipolar scales
for positioning concepts, argues that these scales
are not concept-dependent, but rather they can be
used for grasping the meaning of all concepts. A
second major difference highlighted in Table 2 is
that MDS is the only approach looking at con-
tinuous perceptual dimensions of stimulus, con-
trarily to CM in which the scaling procedes with
discrete conceptual traits, and even more in op-
position to SD which considers entities as primi-
tives. Finally, Table 2 shows the interesting ob-
servation brought forth by Tversky and later em-
pirical studies of Medin et al. (1980) of the non-
equivalence between the notion of similarity and
difference.
Coming back to the question of “how” human
evaluation could be performed to provide a gold
standard for the WSD task, considering the pros
and cons of the different models lead us to sug-
gest a particular strategy of sense attribution.
Combining the similarity/difference of Tversky
with the successive elucidation of Osgood et al.,
two bipolar Likert scales could be used to delimit
a similarity concept: a resembling axis and a con-
trasting axis. In this approach, the similarity con-
cept still stays general, avoiding the problems of
finding specific traits for each instance on which
to have a judgment.
Already in the empirical studies of Murray and
Green (2004), a Likert scale is used, but on an
“applying” axis. Subjects are asked for each
definition of a word to decide whether it “applies
perfectly” or rather “barely applies” to a context
containing the word. The choice of such an axis
has limitations in its applicability for mapping
senses on examples. More general resembling
and contrasting axis would allow for similarity
judgments on any statements whether they are
two sense definitions, two examples or a sense
definition with an example.

4 Mathematical Models of Similarity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952">
Logic and mathematics are extremely prolific
in similarity measurement models. According to
Dubois et al (1997), they are used for cognitive
tasks like classification, case-based reasoning
and interpolation. In the present study, we re-
strict our investigation to the classification task
as representative on the unsupervised WSD task.
The other approaches are inferential strategies,
using already solved problems to extrapolate or
interpolate solutions to new problems. Those
would be appropriate for WSD in a supervised
context (provided training data), but due to space
constraints, we postpone discussion of those
models to a later study. Our present analysis di-
vides classification models into two criteria: the
cardinality of sets and the proximity-based simi-
larity measures.

<bodyText confidence="0.995966333333333">
In line with De Baets et al. (2001), similarity
measures can be investigated under a rational
cardinality-based criterion of sets. In an exten-
sive study of 28 similarity measures for ordinary
sets, this research showed that measures can be
classified on the basis of only a few properties.
They proposed at first to build the class of cardi-
nality-based similarity measures from one ge-
neric formula:

(1,1) and X −Y denotes the sets difference

X − Y = X Y .

The classification of these 28 similarity meas-
ures (which can all be linked to the general for-
mula) becomes possible by borrowing from the
framework of fuzzy sets the concepts of T for t-
norm (fuzzy intersection) operators and T-
equivalence for the property of T-
indistinguishability (De Baets et al., 2001). So, a
typical measure M of T-equivalence under the
universe U must satisfy the following condi-
tions for any (x, y, z) ∈ U: (i) M(x, x) =1 (re-

All 28 measures show reflexivity and symme-
try but they vary on the type of transitivity they
achieve. In fact, studying boundary and
monotonicity behavior of the different measures,
De Baets et al. (2001) group them under four
types corresponding to four different formulas of
fuzzy intersections (t-norms): the standard inter-
section Z(a, b) = min(a, b) , the Lukasiewicz t-
norm L(a, b) = max(0, a + b −1) , the algebraic
product P(a, b) = ab and the drastic intersec-
tion D(a, b) = (a when b = 1 , b when a= 1
and 0 otherwise). We refer the reader to De
Baets et al. (2001) to get the full scope of their
results. Accordingly, Jaccard’s coefficient J
(equation 9) and Russel-Rao’s coefficient R
(equation 10) are both, for example, L-transivive
(Lukasiewicz’ type):

Following our second criterion of classifica-
tion, mathematics also uses diverse proximity-
based similarity measures. We subdivide these
mathematical measures into three groups: the
distance model, the probabilistic model, and the
angular coefficients. The first one, the distance
model, overlaps in part with the subjective scal-
ing of similarity as presented in the psychologi-
cal approaches (section 3.1). The mathematical
model is the same with a metric of distance
d(x, y) computed between the objects in a space.
Algorithms like formulae (2), (3) and (4) of sec-
tion 3.1 are amongst the proximity-based similar-
ity measures.
Second, the probabilistic model is based on
the statistical analysis of objects and their attrib-
utes in a data space. Lebart &amp; Rajman (2000)
gave many examples of that kind of proximity
measures, such as the Kullback-Leiber distance
DK between two documents A and B, given the
probability distribution P = { p1,p2,...,pn }:

The third mathematical model is also a metric
space model but it uses angular measures be-
tween vectors of features to determine the simi-
larity between objects. A well-known measure
from that group is the cosine-correlation:
Although conditions applying on proximity-
based measures are shortly described in Cross
and Sudkamp (2002) and Miyamoto (1990) for
fuzzy sets, we are not aware of an extensive re-
search such as the one by De Baets et al. (2001),
presented in section 4.1, for classifying cardinal-
ity of sets types. We make such an attempt in the
following section.

In this section, we perform a classification and
analysis exercise for similarity measure4, possi-
bly used for WSD, but more generally used in
any task where similarity between words is re-
quired. Table 3 shows the measures classified in
the four categories of the mathematical model
presented in section 4: measures of cardinality
(Card), of distance (Dist), of probability (Prob)
and of angle (Ang).
We sustain that these groupings can be further
justified based on two criteria: the psychological
model of meaning (Table 2) and the typical
properties of the classes (Table 4). The first crite-
rion refers to the representation of concepts dis-
tinguishing between the dense-state and the dis-
crete-state5 of concept (meaning) attributes. That
psychological distinction is helpful to categorize
some metrics, like Gotoh, which seems hybrid
(Card and Dist). In such a metric, the penalty for
the gap between two concepts applies on the de-
fect of the dense-state, such as for a blurred im-

The second criterion is a study on shared
properties for each category of the mathematical
model. Table 4 summarizes the properties using
the following schema: (m) minimality, (r) reflex-
ivity, (s) symmetry, (ti) triangle inequality, (tr)
transitivity.

From Table 4, we see for instance that reflex-
ivity is a basic property for cardinality measures
because we wish to regularly count discrete ob-
jects in a set. On the opposite side, the minimal-
ity property is a characteristic of a distance
measure, since it is noticeable by the displace-
ment or the change, for example, in distinctive
images. According to Fodor (1998), we say that
statistical or probabilistic approaches exhibit
several necessary and sufficient conditions for
the inclusion of elements in the extension of a
concept, but the dominant element, such as the
pattern of comparison (in Maximal matches for
instance) is anti-reflexive and asymmetric with
the resulting elements. However, there is symme-
try in the resultant, but there is still anti-
reflexivity.
We also single out the angular metrics from
distance measures even though they use a similar
analysis of the qualitative variation of entities.
According to Ekman &amp; Sjöberg (1965), a method
using similarity converted into cosine representa-
tion has the advantage to reveal two components
of percepts, i.e. the two-dimensional vector is a
modeling in magnitude and direction. Thus, an-
gular metrics can be a means used to contrast
two semantic features of entities.

Finding out that different sets of properties can
serve as dividing lines between groups of metrics
is interesting in itself, but does not answer the
question as to which set is more appropriate than
others. We do not wish to answer this question
here as we believe it is application-dependent,
but we do wish to emphasize that a questioning
should take place before choosing a particular
measure. In fact, for each property, there is an
appropriate question that can be asked, as is
summarized in Table 5.
Table 5 – Questioning for Measure Selection
Property Question
Minimality Is the minimal distance between objects the
distance of an object with itself?
Symmetry Is it true that the distance between x and y is
always the same as the distance between y
and x?
Triangle Is it appropriate that a direct distance be-
Inequality tween x and z is always smaller than a com-
posed distance from x to y and y to z?
Reflexivity Is it true that the relation that it holds be-
tween an object and itself is always the
same?
Transitivity Is it necessarily the case that when x is
similar to y and y is similar to z, that x be
similar to z?
For the task of WSD investigated in this paper,
we hope to open the debate as to which proper-
ties are to be taken into consideration.

is under way on both angles. First, we suggested,
based on some psychological and philosophical
model analysis, a two-axis Osgood-like bench-
marking approach for “ordinary human” word-
sense judgments. We intend to perform an em-
pirical experiment to validate this idea by look-
ing at inter-judge agreement.
On the algorithm side, although the ap-
proaches based on the cardinality of sets are not
central to WSD, we presented them first as we
find it inspiring to see an effort of classification
on those measures. We then attempted a some-
what more broad classification by emphasizing
properties of different groups of similarity meas-
ures: cardinality of sets, distance, probabilistic
measures and angular metrics. Although each
group has a particular subset of properties, we
noted that all of them share a property of transi-
tivity. This is interestingly different from the
psychological contrast model of Tversky where
differences and similarities are measured differ-
ently on different criteria. We think investiga-
tions into similarity measures which reproduce
such a non-transitive differentiation approach
should be performed. We are on that path in our
larger study. We also suggest that any proposal
of a measure for a task should be preceded by a
study of which properties seem adequate for such
a task. We conclude by opening up the debate
for the WSD task.

First, we look at models suggested in the psychology and philosophy literature which capture the essence of concept similarity evaluation for humans. Second, we analyze the properties of many metrics which simulate such evaluation capabilities. The first angle reveals that non-experts can judge similarity and that their judgments need not be based on predefined traits. We use such conclusions to inform us on how gold standards for word sense disambiguation tasks could be established. From the second angle, we conclude that more attention should be paid to metric properties before assigning them to perform a particular task.</abstract>

Before being tempted to call up gigabytes of corpus evidence data and computational strength to help us identify the family of resemblance emerging here, let us further look at the nature of that notion from a philosophical point of view. Possible senses of individual things could be traced back to Aristotle’s work and identified “without qualification” as the primary substance of a thing (Cassam, 1986). What accounts for the substance of an object, for Aristotle, was the thing itself, namely its essence. Taking a slightly different view on the notion of family of objects, Putnam (1977) instead pursues a quest for natural kinds and according to him, the distinguishing characteristics that “hold together” natural kinds are the “core facts [...] conveying the use of words of that kind” (Putnam, 1977: 118). Putnam disagrees with any analytical approaches sustaining that the meaning of a word X is given by a conjunction of properties P = {P1, P2,... Pn} in such a way that P is the essence of X. </context>

Combining the similarity/difference of Tversky with the successive elucidation of Osgood et al., two bipolar Likert scales could be used to delimit a similarity concept: a resembling axis and a contrasting axis. In this approach, the similarity concept still stays general, avoiding the problems of finding specific traits for each instance on which to have a judgment. Already in the empirical studies of Murray and Green (2004), a Likert scale is used, but on an “applying” axis. Subjects are asked for each definition of a word to decide whether it “applies perfectly” or rather “barely applies” to a context containing the word. The choice of such an axis has limitations in its applicability for mapping senses on examples. More general resembling and contrasting axis would allow for similarity judgments on any statements whether they are two sense definitions, two examples or a sense definition with an example. 4 Mathematical Models of Similarity Logic and mathematics are extremely prolific in similarity measurement m</context>

According to Osgood et al. “the imagery found in synesthesia is intimately tied up with language metaphor, and both represent semantic relations” (1957: 23). In SD, bipolar adjectives used in succession can mediate a generalization to the meaning of a sign, as uncertainty on each scale is reduced with the successive process of elicitation. By postulating representation in a semantic space, each orthogonal axis of selection produces a semantic differentiation when the subjects rate the semantic alternatives on a bipolar scale. Although that space could be multidimensional, empirical studies (Osgood et al., 1957) on factor analysis showed stability and relative importance of three particular dimensions labeled as Evaluation, Potency, and Activity (EPA). We refer the reader to Osgood et al. (1957) for further explanation on these EPA dimensions. 3.4 WSD and human judgments Table 2 emphasizes commonalities and differences between the three psychological models explored.

Before being tempted to call up gigabytes of corpus evidence data and computational strength to help us identify the family of resemblance emerging here, let us further look at the nature of that notion from a philosophical point of view. Possible senses of individual things could be traced back to Aristotle’s work and identified “without qualification” as the primary substance of a thing (Cassam, 1986). What accounts for the substance of an object, for Aristotle, was the thing itself, namely its essence. Taking a slightly different view on the notion of family of objects, Putnam (1977) instead pursues a quest for natural kinds and according to him, the distinguishing characteristics that “hold together” natural kinds are the “core facts [...] conveying the use of words of that kind” (Putnam, 1977: 118). Putnam disagrees with any analytical approaches sustaining that the meaning of a word X is given by a conjunction of properties P = {P1, P2,... Pn} in such a way that P is the essence of X. The problem is that a “natural kind may have abnormal members” (Putnam, 1977: 103). For instance, normal lemons have a yellow peel but let’s suppose in accordance with Putnam, that a new </context>

By definition, the resulting metric function over a set X should fullfill the following conditions: ∀x, y, z ∈ X: 1. d (x, y) ≥ d (x, x) = 0 (minimality), 2. d (x, y) = d (y, x) (symmetry), 3. d (x, y) ≥ d (x, z) + d (z, y) (triangle ineq.). Accordingly to Shepard (1974), the distance in equation (1) can be computed with different metrics. Some of these metrics are given in Lebart and Rajman (2000). The Euclidean metric is the best known: Another yet is the Minkowski metric: 1 ( )n n ( xik xjk − ) k 1 There is a main concern with the MDS model. Tversky (1977) criticized the adequacy of the metric distance functions as he showed that the three conditions of minimality, symmetry and triangle inequality are sometimes empirically violated. For instance, Tversky and Gati showed empirically that assessment of the similarity between pairs of countries was asymetric when they asked for “the degree to which Red China is similar to North Korea” (1978: 87) and in the reverse order, i.e. similarity between North Korea and Red China. 3.2 Objective Scaling The second approach is called objective scaling by Voinov “though this term is not widely accepted” (Voino</context>

Equation (5) is the matching axiom of the CM. A second fundamental property of that model is given by the axiom of monotonicity: S(A, B) &gt;- S(A, C) (6) IfA CcA B, A−B c A−C, and B − A c C − A, then (6) is satisfied. With these two axioms (5-6), Tversky (1977) defined the basis of what he called the matching function using the theoretical notion of feature sets rather then the geometric concept of similarity distance. Interesting empirical studies followed this research on CM and aimed at finding the correlation between human judgments of similarity and difference.

According to him, the objectivity of the method comes from the fact that similarity measures are calculated from the ratio of objective features that describe objects under analysis. So, subjects are asked to make qualitative judgments on common or distinctive features of objects and the comparison is then made by any distance axioms. Tversky’s (1977) contrast model (CM) is the best known formalization of this approach. In his model, the measure of similarity is computed by: S A B f A B f A B ( , ) ( ) ( = α − β − − χf (B − A) (5) (, ) x i x j wk x ik x jk ( − ) . (2) dE m 1 k 1 2 2 The city</context>

Contrarily to this intuition, Table 1 shows definitions and examples for a few senses of game in Wordnet1, from which resemblance cannot be found in terms of common words in the definitions or examples.
