We present work in progress in the application
of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tech-
nology to the analysis of textual transcriptions
of psychotherapy sessions in the Spanish Lan-
guage. We are developing a set of NLP tools
as well as adapting an existing dictionary for
the analysis of interviews framed on a psycho-
analytic theory. We investigate the applica-
tion of NLP techniques, including dictionary-
based interpretation, and speech act identifica-
tion and classification for the (semi) automatic
identification in text of a set of psychoanalyt-
ical variables. The objective of the work is to
provide a set of tools and resources to assist

Computer-based textual analysis in psychology is
not new; in psychotherapy, electronic dictionaries
and other lexical resources are widely used to anal-
yse both therapist’s and patient’s discourses pro-
duced during psychotherapy sessions. In this pa-
per we present work in progress in the applica-
tion of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tech-
nology to the analysis of psychotherapy sessions in
the Spanish Language. Based on a psychoanalytic
theory, we are developing a set of NLP tools as

sification for the automatic analysis of spoken tran-
scriptions in Spanish of psychoanalysis sessions be-
tween therapists and patients. In Figure 1 we show
a fragment of a manually transcribed interview in
Spanish (and its translation to English) from our de-
velopment corpus.
The automatic analysis of the sessions, which is
used as a tool for assessment and interpretation of
the transcribed psychotherapy sessions is based on
a theory developed by Liberman and extended by
Maldavsky (Liberman and Maldavsky, 1975) and
framed on Freudian theory (Freud, 1925). The au-
tomatic tools to be presented here aim at recogniz-
ing a subset of Freudian drives manifested in both
patient’s and therapist’s discourse.
The objective of the analysis is not to provide a
full automated solution to discourse interpretation
in this area, but a set of tools and resources to as-
sist therapists during discourse analysis. Although
work in text-based interpretation in psychology is
not new, researchers in our project have identified
limitations in current practices due to the fact that
current text-based systems do not tackle ambiguity
problems at lexical, syntactic, or semantic levels:
for example systems that consider out-of-context su-
perficial forms would are unable to distinguish be-
tween different used of the same lexical item (“para”
as a preposition vs. “para” as a form of the verb
“parar” (to stop); “rio” as a common noun vs. “rio”
as a contextual clue for the identification of a geo-
graphical name; etc.). The use of advanced natural
language processing techniques could help produce

worth mentioning that full interpretation of therapy
sessions is not only based on textual analysis, but
also in other elements of the session such as the ac-

as patient movement, etc. This work addresses only
text interpretation issues.

<bodyText confidence="0.99994135483871">
There are a number of well-established compu-
tational tools for the analysis and extraction of
meaning from text in the social sciences (See
(Alexa and Zuell, 2000) for an overview of tools
and resources). Some tools are bound to particular
theoretical principles, for example the LWIC dic-
tionary (Pennebaker et al., 2001) encodes specific
categories to be identified in text while others follow
a theory-free approach (Iker and Klein, 1974) where
the theory emerges from the analysis of the data.
There has been substantial research in the de-
velopment of methods to analyze linguistic input
in the field of psychotherapy in order to measure a
number of psychological variables such as emotion,
abstraction, referential activity, etc. among them
Bucci’s Referential Activity (RA) non-weighted
(Bucci, 2002) and weighted dictionaries (Bucci and
Maskit, 2006) for the English language, or H¨oltzer
and others’ affective dictionary (H¨olzer et al., 1997)
for the German language. The LIWC tool has been
used to detect different types of personalities in
written self-descriptions (Chung and Pennebaker,
2008). This program counts meaningful words
that express emotion, abstraction, verbal behavior,
demographic variables, traditional personality mea-
sures, formal and informal settings, deception and
honesty, emotional upheavals, social interaction,
use of cognitive and emotion words, word analysis
in psychotherapy, references to self and others.
For Spanish (Roussos and O’Connell, 2005) have
developed a dictionary in the area of psychotherapy

to measure referential activity.
Early work on dictionaries in the area of psy-
chology include the General Inquirer psycho-
sociological dictionary (Stone and Hunt, 1963)
which can be used in various applications; current
work on lexical resources for identifying particu-
lar text variables – such as measuring strong/weak
opinions, sentiments, subjective/objective language,
etc. – include the SentiWordnet resource (Esuli and
Sebastiani, 2006) derived from WordNet which has
been used in various opinion mining works (Devitt
and Ahmad, 2007); other lines of research include
the derivation of word-lists (semi) automatically for
opinion classification (Turney, 2002). To the best of
our knowledge, little research has been carried out
on natural language processing for discourse inter-
pretation in psychology.

3 Theoretical Framework Overview

<bodyText confidence="0.999255769230769">
Liberman’s theory identifies 7 drives (i.e., a sub-
set of Freud’s drives) which are introduced in Ta-
ble 1 we may associate these drives with emotional
or affective states such as: strong emotions asso-
ciated with IL; ecstasy or trance with O1; sadness
with O2; anger with A1; concrete language with
A2; warnings, suspense, and premonition with UPH
; and congratulation, adulation, and promises with
GPH. In diagnosis these variables are associated to
pathologies such as addiction, schizophrenia, de-
pression, paranoia, obsession, phobia, and hysteria;
so their manifestation in text is of paramount impor-
tance for diagnosis.

ing hypothesis is that drives manifest through lin-
guistic style, present at word level, phrase, and nar-
rative. Lexicalisations for each drive have been care-
fully selected following a variety of methods includ-
ing manual derivation of words from concepts, study
of texts where a scene is clearly present (e.g., every-
day activities), use of thesaurus, etc. Ambiguity is
preserved and a lexicalisation can signal more than
one drive. We show some lexicalisations in Table 2.
In addition to word-level analysis, the theory pro-
vides methods for analysis at narrative and speech
act level.
Speech acts are actions performed when making
an utterance (Searle, 1969) and they include (Searle,
1976) illocutionary (e.g. assert, suggest), perlocu-
tionary (e.g. convince, insult), and propositional
(e.g. making a reference) types. There has been sub-
stantial work on speech act segmentation and classi-
fication. Different authors adopt different classifica-
tions or theories of speech acts in order to restrict
the categories to those relevant for the purpose of
analysis. For example, in dialogue systems (Allen et

acts may vary from 4 to 10 categories and it may
include acts such as assertion, WH-question, direc-
tives, greeting, direct/indicrect request, etc.
The pychoanalytic framework we are following has
its own inventory of speech acts. The objective is
also to link scenes in narratives and speech acts to
the 7 drives (in Table 1). There is a variety of speech
acts in the adopted framework, in Table 3 we present
a sample of speech acts associated to each of the
drives. The objective of the semi-automatic analysis
is to help their identification to facilitate the work of
the psychotherapist.

4 Text Analysis of Interviews
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998702615384615">
We have implemented a series of programs, lexical
resources, and grammars to process interviews and
other types of textual data in Spanish. We are us-
ing the GATE system (Maynard et al., 2002) as an
infrastructure or development framework; most de-
velopments are new, not included in the GATE sys-
tem, and they are packaged in a plug-in which can
be accessed through the GATE system or used stand-
alone. We have developed various programs to auto-
matically annotate the interviews including segmen-
tation of the transcription, word-based thematic seg-
mentation, tagging, and dictionary-based interpreta-
tion and analysis.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.817945">
4.1 Dictionary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964409090909">
One of the main components of the system is a
dictionary which is taken as the basis for text inter-
pretation. This is being implemented as a language
resource in GATE. It is based on lists of word forms
which have been created for each of the drives.
The lists are organized according to their parts
of speech. The available dictionary (Maldavsky,
2003) contains all inflected forms of verbs, nouns,
adjectives, and adverbs which we are transforming
into a dictionary which will contain only roots. An
instance of the dictionary is created from the set of
lists and kept on-line for processing. The current
version of the dictionary (inflected forms) contains
over 298 thousand verb forms, over 22 thousand
noun forms, over 137 thousand adjectives, and over
9 thousand adverbs. An annotation tool has been
implemented based on a schema for our dictionary,
we use the graphical user interface functionalities
provided by the GATE infrastructure allowing a
researcher annotate words she may want to included
in the dictionary or segment the text in units for
further analysis.

clarin.eu/tools/treetagger) has
been implemented in order to call it from
the GATE system and an alignment program
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9935306">
has been developed to associate the output of
the tagger to the actual text of the interview,
therefore creating word annotations containing
features from the TreeTagger and additional
features computed by our programs. Note that
the TreeTagger distributed with GATE was
innapropriate for our purposes because it does
require tokenisation of the input performed
before invoking the tagger, this is the reason
why we had to create our own wrapper.

evaluation program. We have created a train-
able system using machine learning resources
provided by the GATE framework. The
CoNLL 2002 Spanish dataset which provides
information on named entities such as Loca-
tion, Organization, Person, and Miscellaneous
was analyzed using parts-of-speech tagging,
morphological analysis, and gazetteer lookup
in order to derive a set of features for learn-
ing. A supports vector machine was trained
that uses gazetteer information, word level
information, orthography, parts-of-speech, and
lemmatization. We have collected a number
of lists to assist the identification of names
of organization, persons, locations, time ex-
pressions, etc. The performance of the current
system is at 68% F-score. Note that named
entity recognition is particularly important
to track names in longitudinal analysis of
interviews, but also to disambiguate names
which in Spanish are ambiguous (e.g. “amado”
can be a person name in addition to a form of
the verb “amar”; “quito” can be the name of a
place in addition to a form of the verb “quitar”,
etc.)

• A program uses the dictionary and interprets

implemented to break the interview in frag-
ments which can be selected for fine-grained
interpretation. This module is based on tf*idf
similarity between candidate segments. A
second module we are implementing aims
at the recognition of segments referring to
prototypical scenes a patient may refer to:
family, work, love, health, money, etc. Further
gazetteer list information has been collected
from Spanish sources to create lexicons for
assisting the automatic identification of the
above categories. We are in the process of
manually annotating a set of transcriptions as
the basis for training a classification system for
this task. Conceptual information will be used
for this purpose.

terpretation. Note that the current tool con-
siderably improves the previous practises in
dictionary-based interpretation, since the im-
plemented tool takes into account syntactic and

4.3 Rule-based Speech Acts’ Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872074074074">
We are carrying out induction sessions with psy-
chotherapits in order to capture ways in which
speech acts in the adopted framework are expressed.
The induction sessions provided valuable material
to start implementation of a rule-based speech act
detection program (with regular expressions and a
dictionary) based on use use of syntactic and lexical
information. These procedures allow us to collect a
set of expressions and lexical/syntactic patterns for
objective identification of a subset of speech acts.
We are also annotating the development corpus of
interviews (a total of 30 will be annotated with a
minimum of 2 annotators per interview) with speech
acts categories. Each speech segment is annotated
with one main speech act and a number (possibly
zero) subordinate speech acts. We are using the
GATE environment to provide appropriate support
for the annotation process. In Figure 2 we show a
fragment of interview in the annotation tool anno-
tated according to the interpretation of one of our
judges (the annotation window shows a “complaint”
speech act associated to the fragment “no me estaba
tratando de entender como ´el siempre hace” (“he did
not understand as he always does”)). We expect the
annotated corpus to be a valuable resource for the
development of a trainable speech act recognition

5 Perspectives and Current Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999999193548387">
We have described our initial work on a set of tools
being developed for the analysis of psychotherapy
interviews in the Spanish language. The tools ex-
tend work on dictionary-based text interpretation by
incorporating NLP tools such as tagging, topic/scene
segmentation, speech act detection, and named en-
tity recognition. One main contribution of our re-
search is the implementation of a dictionary for the
Spanish language which can be used not only for the
identification of Freudian variables but also for work
on affective language and sentiment analysis. We
are currently working on the development of a full
module for speech-act recognition and on the cre-
ation of a corpus of annotated interviews which will
serve for further training and evaluation purposes.
The set of resources developed in the project will
be made available to the computational linguistics
community for research purposes. We think that al-
though this is work in progress it is worth mention-
ing evaluation. Where evaluation of the tools is con-
cerned, we are carrying out intrinsic evaluation com-
paring annotated categories against predicted cate-
gories currently for named entity recognition and
discourse segmentation and in the future for speech
act recognition and classification. Where more ex-
trinsic evaluation is concerned, we will evaluate how
the tools presented here can help theraphist in bet-
ter interpretation of clinical data. The implemented
tools will also be used to compare word-level based
interpretation produced by the dictionary to interpre-
tation produced by the analysis at speech act level.

<abstract confidence="0.9996326875">We present work in progress in the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to the analysis of textual transcriptions of psychotherapy sessions in the Spanish Language. We are developing a set of NLP tools as well as adapting an existing dictionary for the analysis of interviews framed on a psychoanalytic theory. We investigate the application of NLP techniques, including dictionarybased interpretation, and speech act identification and classification for the (semi) automatic identification in text of a set of psychoanalytical variables. The objective of the work is to provide a set of tools and resources to assist therapist during discourse analysis.</abstract>

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related work in the area of computational tools for text analysis in psychology. In Section 3, the theoretical framework for our work is briefly introduced. Section 4 describes the implementation of NLP tools for the analysis of the interviews and Section 5 closes the paper describing current and future work. 2 Related Work There are a number of well-established computational tools for the analysis and extraction of meaning from text in the social sciences (See (Alexa and Zuell, 2000) for an overview of tools and resources). Some tools are bound to particular theoretical principles, for example the LWIC dictionary (Pennebaker et al., 2001) encodes specific categories to be identified in text while others follow a theory-free approach (Iker and Klein, 1974) where the theory emerges from the analysis of the data. There has been substantial research in the development of methods to analyze linguistic input in the field of psychotherapy in order to measure a number of psychological variables such as emotion, abstraction, referential activity, etc. among them Bucci’s Referentia</context>

In Figure 1 we show a fragment of a manually transcribed interview in Spanish (and its translation to English) from our development corpus. The automatic analysis of the sessions, which is used as a tool for assessment and interpretation of the transcribed psychotherapy sessions is based on a theory developed by Liberman and extended by Maldavsky (Liberman and Maldavsky, 1975) and framed on Freudian theory (Freud, 1925). The automatic tools to be presented here aim at recognizing a subset of Freudian drives manifested in both patient’s and therapist’s discourse.

In Section 3, the theoretical framework for our work is briefly introduced. Section 4 describes the implementation of NLP tools for the analysis of the interviews and Section 5 closes the paper describing current and future work. 2 Related Work There are a number of well-established computational tools for the analysis and extraction of meaning from text in the social sciences (See (Alexa and Zuell, 2000) for an overview of tools and resources). Some tools are bound to particular theoretical principles, for example the LWIC dictionary (Pennebaker et al., 2001) encodes specific categories to be identified in text while others follow a theory-free approach (Iker and Klein, 1974) where the theory emerges from the analysis of the data. There has been substantial research in the development of methods to analyze linguistic input in the field of psychotherapy in order to measure a number of psychological variables such as emotion, abstraction, referential activity, etc. among them Bucci’s Referential Activity (RA) non-weighted (Bucci, 2002) and weighted dictionaries (Bucci and Maskit, 2006) for the English language, or H¨oltzer and others’ affective dict</context>

An annotation tool has been implemented based on a schema for our dictionary, we use the graphical user interface functionalities provided by the GATE infrastructure allowing a researcher annotate words she may want to included in the dictionary or segment the text in units for further analysis. 4.2 Programs for Interviews’ Interpretation The following programs used for the automatic analysis of the interviews. • A wrapper to the TreeTagger parts of speech package (Schmid, 1995) (See http://www. clarin.eu/tools/treetagger) has been implemented in order to call it from the GATE system and an alignment program has been developed to associate the output of the tagger to the actual text of the interview, therefore creating word annotations containing features from the TreeTagger and additional features computed by our programs. Note that the TreeTagger distributed with GATE was innapropriate for our purposes because it does require tokenisation of the input performed before invoking the tagger, this is the reason why we had to create our own wrapper. • A segmentation pro</context>
