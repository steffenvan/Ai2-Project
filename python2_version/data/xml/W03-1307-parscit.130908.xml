<bodyText confidence="0.999953157894737">
In this paper, we explore how to adapt a
general Hidden Markov Model-based
named entity recognizer effectively to
biomedical domain. We integrate various
features, including simple deterministic
features, morphological features, POS
features and semantic trigger features, to
capture various evidences especially for
biomedical named entity and evaluate
their contributions. We also present a
simple algorithm to solve the abbreviation
problem and a rule-based method to deal
with the cascaded phenomena in biomedi-
cal domain. Our experiments on GENIA
V3.0 and GENIA V1.1 achieve the 66.1
and 62.5 F-measure respectively, which
outperform the previous best published
results by 8.1 F-measure when using the
same training and testing data.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996855">
As the research in biomedical domain has grown
rapidly in recent years, a huge amount of nature
language resources have been developed and be-
come a rich knowledge base. The technique of
named entity (NE) recognition (NER) is strongly
demanded to be applied in biomedical domain.
Since in previous work, many NER systems have
been applied successfully in newswire domain
(Zhou and Su 2002; Bikel et al. 1999; Borthwich et
al. 1999), more and more explorations have been
done to port existing NER system into biomedical
domain (Kazama et al. 2002; Takeuchi et al. 2002;
Nobata et al. 1999 and 2000; Collier et al. 2000;
Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Fukuda et al. 1998; Proux
et al. 1998). However, compared with those in
newswire domain, these systems haven’t got high
performance. It is probably because of the follow-
ing factors of biomedical NE (Zhang et al. 2003):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9682152">
1. Some modifiers are often before basic NEs,
e.g. activated B cell lines, and sometimes biomedi-
cal NEs are very long, e.g. 47 kDa sterol regula-
tory element binding factor. This kind of factor
highlights the difficulty for identifying the bound-
ary of NE.
2. Two or more NEs share one head noun by
using conjunction or disjunction construction, e.g.
91 and 84 kDa proteins. It is hard to identify these
NEs respectively.
3. An entity may be found with various spelling
forms, e.g. N-acetylcysteine, N-acetyl-cysteine,
NAcetylCysteine, etc. Since the use of capitaliza-
tion is casual, the capitalization information may
not be so evidential in this domain.
4. NE may be cascaded. One NE may be em-
bedded in another NE, e.g. &lt;PROTEIN&gt;&lt;DNA&gt;
kappa 3&lt;/DNA&gt; binding factor &lt;/PROTEIN&gt;.
More effort must be made to identify this kind of
NE.
5. Abbreviations are frequently used in bio-
medical domain, e.g. TCEd, IFN, TPA, etc. Since
abbreviations don’t have many evidences for cer-
tain NE class, it is difficult to classify them cor-
rectly.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967961538461">
These factors above make NER in biomedical
domain difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to ex-
plore more evidential features and more effective
methods to cope with such difficulties.
In this paper, we will study how to adapt a gen-
eral Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based NE rec-
ognizer (Zhou and Su 2002) to biomedical domain.
We specially explore various evidences for bio-
medical NE and propose methods to cope with ab-
breviations and cascaded phenomena. As a result,
features (simple deterministic features, morpho-
logical features, part-of-speech features and head
noun trigger features) and methods (abbreviation
recognition algorithm and rule-based cascaded
phenomena resolution) are integrated in our system.
The experiment shows that system outperforms the
best published system by 8.1 F-measure.
In Section 2, we will introduce the HMM-
based NE recognizer briefly. In Section 3, we will
focus on the features that we have used. The
methods and the adaptations of different features
will be discussed in detail. In Section 5 and 6, we
will present the solutions of abbreviation and cas-
caded phenomena. Finally, our experiment results
will be presented and the contributions of different
features will be analyzed in Section 7.

Our system is adapted from a HMM-based NE

parts: 1. Boundary category, which denotes the
position of the current word in NE. 2. Entity cate-
gory, which indicates the NE class. 3. Feature set,
which will be discussed in Section 3.
When we incorporate a plentiful feature set in
HMM, we will encounter data sparseness problem.
An alternative back-off modeling approach by
means of constraint relaxation is applied in our
model (Zhou and Su 2002). It enables the decod-
ing process effectively find a near optimal fre-
quently occurred pattern entry in determining the
NE tag probability distribution of current word.
Finally, the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi 1967) is
implemented to find the most likely tag sequence
in the state space of the possible tag distribution
based on the state transition probabilities. Fur-
thermore, some constraints on the boundary cate-
gory and entity category between two consecutive
tags are applied to filter the invalid NE tags (Zhou
and Su 2002).

3.1 Simple Deterministic Features (Fsd)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998006">
The purpose of simple deterministic features is to
capture the capitalization, digitalization and word
formation information. This kind of features have
been widely used in both newswire NER system,
such as (Zhou and Su 2002), and biomedical NER
system, such as (Nobata et al. 1999; Gaizauskas et
al. 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Takeuchi and Collier
2002; Kazama et al. 2002). Based on the charac-
teristics of biomedical NEs, we designed simple
deterministic features manually. Table 1 shows the
simple deterministic features with descending or-
der of priority.

From Table 1, we can find that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9967738">
1. Features such as comma, dot, StopWord, etc.
are designed intuitively to provide information to
detect the boundary of NE.
2. Features Parenthesis is often used to indicate
the definition of abbreviation in biomedical docu-
ments.
3. Features GreekLetter and RomanDigit are
specially designed to capture the symbols
frequently occurred in biomedical NE.
4. Feature ATCG sequence identify the similar-
ity of words according to their word formations,
e.g. AACAAAG, CTCAGGA, etc.
5. Features dealing with mixed alphabets and
digits such as AlphaDigitAlpha, CapMixAlpha, etc.
are beneficial for biomedical abbreviations.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.941828176470588">
Furthermore, we evaluate these features and
compare with those used in MUC (Zhou and Su,
2002). The reported result of the simple determi-
nistic features used in MUC can achieve F-
measure of 74.1 (Zhou and Su 2002), but when
they are used in biomedical domain, they only get
F-measure of 24.3. By contrast, using the simple
deterministic features we designed for biomedical
NER, the system achieves F-measure of 29.4. Ac-
cording to the comparison, some findings may be
concluded as follows:
1) Simple deterministic features are domain de-
pendent, which suggests that it is necessary to de-
sign special features for biomedical NER.
2) Simple deterministic features have weaker
predictive power for NE classes in biomedical do-
main than in newswire domain.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999755">
3.2 Morphological Feature (Fm)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961">
Morphological information, such as prefix/suffix,
is considered as an important cue for terminology
identification. In our system, we get most frequent
100 prefixes and suffixes from training data as
candidates. Then, each of these candidates is
evaluated according to formula f1.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.912461">
Wt. = (#INi−#OUT) (f1)
` Ni
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958111111111">
in which, #INi is the number that prefix/suffix i
occurs within NEs; #OUTi is the number that pre-
fix/suffix i occurs out of NEs; Ni is the total num-
ber of prefix/suffix i.
The formula assumes that the particular pre-
fix/suffix, which is most likely inside NEs and
least likely outside NEs, may be thought as a good
evidence for distinguishing the NEs. The candi-
dates with Wt above a certain threshold (0.7 in ex-
periment) are chosen. Then, we calculated the
frequency of each prefix/suffix in each NE class
and group the prefixes/suffixes with the similar
distribution among NE classes into one feature.
This is because prefixes/suffixes with the similar
distribution have the similar contribution, and it
will avoid suffering from the data sparseness prob-
lem. Some of morphological features were listed
in Table 2.

From Table 2, the suffixes —cin, —mide, —zole
have been grouped into one feature sOOC because
they all have the high frequency in the NE class
OtherOrganicCompound and relatively low fre-
quencies in the other NE classes. In our system,
totally 37 prefixes and suffixes were selected and
grouped to 23 features.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999522">
3.3 Part-of-Speech Features (Fpos)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990705914285714">
In the previous NER research in newswire domain,
part-of-speech (POS) features were stated not use-
ful, as POS features may affect the use of some
important capitalization information (Zhou and Su
2002). However, since more and more words with
lower case are included in NEs, capitalization in-
formation in biomedical domain is not as eviden-
tial as it in newswire domain (Zhang et al. 2003).
Moreover, since many biomedical NEs are descrip-
tive and long, identifying NE boundary is not a
trivial task. POS tagging can provide the evidence
of noun phrase region based on word syntactic in-
formation and the noun phrases are most likely to
be NE. Therefore, we reconsidered the POS tag-
ging.
In previous research, (Kazama et al. 2002)
make use of POS information and conclude that it
only slightly improves performance. Moreover,
(Collier et al. 2000; Nobata et al. 2000; Takeuchi
and Collier. 2002) don’t incorporate POS informa-
tion in their systems. The probable reason ex-
plained by them is that since POS tagger they used
is trained on newswire articles, the assigned POS
tags are often incorrect in biomedical documents.
On the whole, it can be concluded that POS infor-
mation hasn’t been well used in previous work.
In our experiment, a POS tagger was trained us-
ing 80% of GENIA V2.1 corpus (536 abstracts,
123K words) and evaluated on the rest 20% (134
abstracts, 29K words). We use GENIA corpus to
train the POS tagger in order to let it be adapted for
biomedical domain. As for comparison, we also
trained the POS tagger on Wall Street Journal arti-
cles (2500 articles, 756K words) and tested on the
20% of GENIA corpus. The results are shown in

From Table 3, it can be found that POS tagger
trained on the biomedical documents performs
much better on the biomedical testing documents
than that trained on WSJ articles. This is consis-
tent with earlier explanation for why POS features
are not so useful in biomedical NER (Nobata et al.
2000; Takeuchi and Collier 2002).

3.4 Semantic Trigger Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998832">
Semantic trigger features are collected to capture
the evidence of certain NE class based on the se-
mantic information of some key words. Initially,
we design two types of semantic triggers: head
noun triggers and special verb triggers.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.554084">
3.4.1 Head Noun Triggers (Fhnt)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999388857142857">
Head noun means the main noun or noun phrase of
some compound words and describes the function
or the property, e.g. “B cells” is the head noun for
the NE “activated human B cells”. Compared with
the other words in NE, head noun is a much more
decisive factor for distinguishing NE classes. For
instance,

In our work, we extract uni-gram and bi-grams
of head nouns automatically from training data,
and rank them by frequency. According to the ex-
periment, we selected 60% top ranked head nouns
as trigger features for each NE class. Some exam-
ples are shown in Table 4.
In the future application, we may also extract
the head nouns from some public resources to en-
hance the triggers.

<bodyText confidence="0.999903933333333">
Besides collecting the triggers, such as head noun
triggers, from the NEs themselves, we also extract
the triggers from the local contexts of the NEs.
Recently, some frequently occurred verbs in bio-
medical document have been proved useful for
extracting the interaction between entities (Thomas
et al. 2000; Sekimizu et al. 1998). In biomedical
NER, we have the intuition that particular verbs
may also provide the evidence for boundary and
NE class. For instance, the verb bind is often used
to indicate the interaction between proteins.
In our system, we selected 20 most frequent
verbs which occur adjacent to NE from training
data automatically as the verb trigger features,
which is shown in Table 5.

4 Method for Abbreviation Recognition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99957">
Abbreviations are widely used in biomedical do-
main. Identifying the class of them constitutes an
important and difficult problem (Zhang et al. 2003).
In our current system, we incorporate a method
to classify abbreviation by mapping the abbrevia-
tion to its full form. This approach is based on the
assumption that it is easier to classify the full form
than abbreviation. In most cases, this assumption
is valid because the full form has more evidences
than its abbreviation to capture the NE class.
Moreover, if we can map the abbreviation to its
full form in the current document, the recognized
abbreviation is still helpful for classifying the same
forthcoming abbreviations in the same document,
as in (Zhou and Su 2002).
In practice, abbreviation and its full form often
occur simultaneously with parenthesis when first
appear in biomedical documents. There are two
cases:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9898865">
1. full form (abbreviation)
2. abbreviation (full form)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.957062730769231">
Most patterns conform to the first case and if
the content inside the parenthesis includes more
than two words, the second case is assumed
(Schwartz and Hearst 2003).
In these two cases, the use of parenthesis is
both evidential and confusing. On one hand, it is
evidential because it can provide the indication to
map the abbreviation to its full form. On the other
hand, it is confusing because it makes the annota-
tion of NE more complicated. Sometimes, the ab-
breviation and its full form are annotated
separately, such as
&lt;CellType&gt;human mononulear leuko-
cytes&lt;/CellType&gt;(&lt;CellType&gt;hMNL&lt;/CellType&gt;),
and sometimes, they are all embedded in the whole
entity, such as
&lt;OtherName&gt;leukotriene B4 (LTB4) genera-
tion&lt;/OtherName&gt;.
Therefore, parenthesis needs to be treated specially.
We develop an abbreviation recognition algorithm
described in Figure 1.
In preprocessing stage, we remove the abbre-
viations and parentheses from the sentence, when
the abbreviation is first defined. This measure will
make the annotation simpler and the NE recognizer
more effective. The main work in this stage is to
judge which case the current pattern belongs to and
record the original positions of the abbreviation
and parenthesis.
After applying the HMM-based NE recognizer
to the sentence, we restore the abbreviation and
parenthesis to the original position in the sentence.
Next, the abbreviation is classified. There are two
priorities of the class (from high to low): the class
of its full form identified by the recognizer, and the
class of the abbreviation itself identified by the
recognizer. At last, the same abbreviation occur-
ring in the rest sentences of the current document
are assigned the same NE class.

5 Solution of Cascaded Phenomena
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999335108108108">
In (Zhang et al. 2003), they state that 16.57% of
NEs in GENIA V3.0 have cascaded annotations,
such as
&lt;RNA&gt;&lt;DNA&gt;CIITA&lt;/DNA&gt; mRNA&lt;/RNA&gt;.
Currently, we only consider the longest NE and
ignore the embedded NEs.
Based on the features described in section 3,
our system counters some problems when dealing
with cascaded NEs. The probable reason is that
the features we used are not so effective for this
kind of NEs.
For instance, POS is based on the assumption
that NE is most likely to be a noun phrase. For
cascaded NE, this assumption may not always be
valid because one NE may consist of two or more
noun phrases connected by some special words,
such as TSH receptor specific T cell lines.
Moreover, in section 3.4.1, we have shown that
head noun is the significant clue for distinguishing
NE classes. Even for cascaded NEs, head noun
features are still effective to some extent, such as
IL-2 mRNA. However, cascaded NEs sometimes
contain two or more head nouns, which belong to
different NE classes. For example, &lt;DNA&gt;IgG Fc
receptor type IC gene&lt;/DNA&gt;, in which receptor
is the head noun of protein and gene is the head
noun of DNA. In general, the latter head noun will
be more important. Unfortunately, it seems that
sometimes the shorter NE is more possible to be
identified, such as &lt;protein&gt;IgG Fc recep-
tor&lt;/protein&gt; type IC gene.
On the whole, we have to explore an additional
method to cope with the cascaded phenomena
separately. In our experiment, we attempt to solve
this problem based on some rules.
In GENIA corpus, we find that there are four
basic types of cascaded NEs:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9982035">
1. &lt; &lt;NE&gt; head noun &gt;
2. &lt; modifier &lt;NE&gt; &gt;
3. &lt; &lt;NE1&gt; &lt;NE2&gt; &gt;
4. &lt; &lt;NE1&gt; word &lt;NE2&gt; &gt;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.5604885">
Moreover, these cascaded NEs may be generated
iteratively. For instance,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9691595">
5. &lt; modifier &lt;NE&gt; head noun &gt;
6. &lt; &lt;NE1&gt; &lt;NE2&gt; head noun &gt;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996436">
The rules are constructed automatically from
the cascaded NEs in training data. Corresponding
to the four basic types of cascaded NEs mentioned
before, we propose four patterns and apply them
iteratively in each sentence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.934736">
1. &lt;entity1&gt; head noun 4 &lt;entity2&gt;
e.g. &lt;Protein&gt; binding motif 4 &lt;DNA&gt;
2. &lt;entity1&gt; &lt;entity2&gt; 4 &lt;entity3&gt;
e.g. &lt;Lipid&gt; &lt;Protein&gt; 4 &lt;Protein&gt;

e.g. &lt;Virus&gt; infected &lt;Multicell&gt; 4 &lt;Multicell&gt;
In our system, 102 rules are incorporated to
classify the cascaded NEs.

The system is evaluated using standard “preci-
sion/recall/F-measure”, in which “F-measure” is
defined as F-measure = (2PR) / (P+R).
We evaluate our NER system on both V3.0 and
V1.1, each of which has been split into a training
set and a testing set. As for V1.1, we divide the
corpus into 590 abstracts (136K words) as training
set and the rest 80 abstracts (17K words) as testing
set. As for V3.0, we use the same testing set as
V1.1 and the rest 1920 abstracts (447K words) as
training set.

Table 6 shows the overall performance of our
system on V3.0 and V1.1, and the best reported
system on V1.1 described in (Kazama et al. 2002).
On V1.1, we use the same training and testing data
and capture the same NE classes as (Kazama et al.
2002). Our system (62.5 F-measure) outperforms
Kazama’s (54.4 F-measure) by 8.1 F-measure.
This probably benefits from the various evidential
features and the effective methods we proposed.
Furthermore, as our expectation, the performance
achieved on V3.0 (66.1 F-measure) is better than
that on V1.1 (62.5 F-measure), which indicate that
our system still has some room for improvement
with the larger training data set.

In addition, Figure 2 shows the detailed per-
formance chart of each NE class on V3.0. In the
figure, the numbers in the parenthesis are the num-
ber that NEs of that class occur in training/testing
data. It can be found that the performances vary a
lot among the NE classes. Some NE classes that
have very few training data, such as Carbohydrate
and Organism, get extremely low performance.
In order to evaluate the contributions of differ-
ent features, we evaluate our system using different
combinations of features (Table 7).
From Table 7, several findings are concluded:
1) With only Fsd, our system achieves a basic
level F-measure of 29.4.
2) Fm shows the positive effect with 2.4 F-
measure improvement based on the basic level.
However, it only can slightly improve the perform-
ance (+1.2 F-measure) based on Fsd, Fpos and Fhnt.
The probable reason is that the evidences included
in Fm have already been captured by Fhnt. More-
over, the evidences captured by Fhnt are more accu-
rate than that captured by Fm. The contribution
made by Fm may come from where there is no indi-
cation of Fhnt.

3) Fpos is proved very beneficial as it makes
great increase on F-measure (+22.5) based on Fsd
and Fm.
4) Fhnt leads to an improvement of 8.7 F-
measure based on Fsd, Fm and Fpos.
5) Out of our expectation, the use of Fsvt de-
creases both precision and recall, which may be
explained as the present and past participles of
some special verbs often play the adjective-like
roles inside biomedical NEs, such as IL10-
inhibited lymphocytes.

From Table 8, it can be found that the abbrevia-
tion recognition method slightly improves the per-
formance by 0.5 F-measure. The probable reason
is that the recognition of abbreviation relies too
much on the recognition of its full form. Once the
full form is wrongly classified, the abbreviation
and the forthcoming ones throughout the document
are wrong altogether. In the near future, the pre-
defined abbreviation dictionary may be incorpo-
rated to enhance the decision of NE class.
Moreover, it can be found that the rule-based
method effectively solves the problem of cascaded
phenomena and shows prominent improvement
(+3.0 F-measure) based on the performance of
“Fsd+Fm+Fpos+Fhnt”.

<bodyText confidence="0.999979466666667">
In the paper, we describe our exploration on how
to adapt a general HMM-based named entity rec-
ognizer to biomedical domain. We integrate vari-
ous evidences for biomedical NER, including
lexical, morphological, syntactic and semantic in-
formation. Furthermore, we present a simple algo-
rithm to solve the abbreviation problem and a rule-
based method to deal with the cascaded phenom-
ena. Based on such evidences and methods, our
system is successfully adapted to biomedical do-
main and achieves significantly better performance
than the best published system. In the near future,
more effective abbreviation recognition algorithm
and some pre-defined NE lists for some classes
may be incorporated to enhance our system.

The technique of named entity (NE) recognition (NER) is strongly demanded to be applied in biomedical domain. Since in previous work, many NER systems have been applied successfully in newswire domain (Zhou and Su 2002; Bikel et al. 1999; Borthwich et al. 1999), more and more explorations have been done to port existing NER system into biomedical domain (Kazama et al. 2002; Takeuchi et al. 2002; Nobata et al. 1999 and 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Fukuda et al. 1998; Proux et al. 1998). However, compared with those in newswire domain, these systems haven’t got high performance. It is probably because of the following factors of biomedical NE (Zhang et al. 2003): 1. Some modifiers are often before basic NEs, e.g. activated B cell lines, and sometimes biomedical NEs are very long, e.g. 47 kDa sterol regulatory element binding factor. This kind of factor highlights the difficulty for identifying the boundary of NE. 2. Two or more NEs share one head noun by using conjunction or disjunc</context>

Furthermore, some constraints on the boundary category and entity category between two consecutive tags are applied to filter the invalid NE tags (Zhou and Su 2002). 3 Feature Set 3.1 Simple Deterministic Features (Fsd) The purpose of simple deterministic features is to capture the capitalization, digitalization and word formation information. This kind of features have been widely used in both newswire NER system, such as (Zhou and Su 2002), and biomedical NER system, such as (Nobata et al. 1999; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Takeuchi and Collier 2002; Kazama et al. 2002). Based on the characteristics of biomedical NEs, we designed simple deterministic features manually. Table 1 shows the simple deterministic features with descending order of priority.

In practice, abbreviation and its full form often occur simultaneously with parenthesis when first appear in biomedical documents. There are two cases: 1. full form (abbreviation) 2. abbreviation (full form) Most patterns conform to the first case and if the content inside the parenthesis includes more than two words, the second case is assumed (Schwartz and Hearst 2003). In these two cases, the use of parenthesis is both evidential and confusing. On one hand, it is evidential because it can provide the indication to map the abbreviation to its full form. On the other hand, it is confusing because it makes the annotation of NE more complicated. Sometimes, the abbreviation and its full form are annotated separately, such as &lt;CellType&gt;human mononulear leukocytes&lt;/CellType&gt;(&lt;CellType&gt;hMNL&lt;/CellType&gt;), and sometimes, they are all embedded in the whole entity, such as &lt;OtherName&gt;leukotriene B4 (LTB4) generation&lt;/OtherName&gt;.

However, since more and more words with lower case are included in NEs, capitalization information in biomedical domain is not as evidential as it in newswire domain (Zhang et al. 2003).

Identifying the class of them constitutes an important and difficult problem (Zhang et al. 2003). In our current system, we incorporate a method to classify abbreviation by mapping the abbreviation to its full form. This approach is based on the assumption that it is easier to classify the full form than abbreviation. In most cases, this assumption is valid because the full form has more evidences than its abbreviation to capture the NE class.

Currently, we only consider the longest NE and ignore the embedded NEs. Based on the features described in section 3, our system counters some problems when dealing with cascaded NEs. The probable reason is that the features we used are not so effective for this kind of NEs. For instance, POS is based on the assumption that NE is most likely to be a noun phrase. For cascaded NE, this assumption may not always be valid because one NE may consist of two or more noun phrases connecte</context>

Our experiments on GENIA V3.0 and GENIA V1.1 achieve the 66.1 and 62.5 F-measure respectively, which outperform the previous best published results by 8.1 F-measure when using the same training and testing data. 1 Introduction As the research in biomedical domain has grown rapidly in recent years, a huge amount of nature language resources have been developed and become a rich knowledge base. The technique of named entity (NE) recognition (NER) is strongly demanded to be applied in biomedical domain. Since in previous work, many NER systems have been applied successfully in newswire domain (Zhou and Su 2002; Bikel et al. 1999; Borthwich et al. 1999), more and more explorations have been done to port existing NER system into biomedical domain (Kazama et al. 2002; Takeuchi et al. 2002; Nobata et al. 1999 and 2000; Collier et al. 2000; Gaizauskas et al. 2000; Fukuda et al. 1998; Proux et al. 1998). However, compared with those in newswire domain, these systems haven’t got high performance. It is probably because of the following factors of biomedical NE (Zhang et al. 2003): 1. Some modifiers are often before basic NEs, e.g. activated B cell lines, and sometimes biomedical NEs are very long, e.g. 47</context>

More effort must be made to identify this kind of NE. 5. Abbreviations are frequently used in biomedical domain, e.g. TCEd, IFN, TPA, etc. Since abbreviations don’t have many evidences for certain NE class, it is difficult to classify them correctly. These factors above make NER in biomedical domain difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to explore more evidential features and more effective methods to cope with such difficulties. In this paper, we will study how to adapt a general Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based NE recognizer (Zhou and Su 2002) to biomedical domain. We specially explore various evidences for biomedical NE and propose methods to cope with abbreviations and cascaded phenomena. As a result, features (simple deterministic features, morphological features, part-of-speech features and head noun trigger features) and methods (abbreviation recognition algorithm and rule-based cascaded phenomena resolution) are integrated in our system. The experiment shows that system outperforms the best published system by 8.1 F-measure. In Section 2, we will introduce the HMMbased NE recognizer briefly. In Section 3, we will focus on the</context>

In token sequenceG , the token g is defined n 1 i as gi =&lt; fi , wi &gt; , where wi is the word and fi is the feature set related with the word . wi In tag sequenceT , each tag consists of three n ti 1 parts: 1. Boundary category, which denotes the position of the current word in NE. 2. Entity category, which indicates the NE class. 3. Feature set, which will be discussed in Section 3. When we incorporate a plentiful feature set in HMM, we will encounter data sparseness problem. An alternative back-off modeling approach by means of constraint relaxation is applied in our model (Zhou and Su 2002). It enables the decoding process effectively find a near optimal frequently occurred pattern entry in determining the NE tag probability distribution of current word. Finally, the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi 1967) is implemented to find the most likely tag sequence in the state space of the possible tag distribution based on the state transition probabilities. Furthermore, some constraints on the boundary category and entity category between two consecutive tags are applied to filter the invalid NE tags (Zhou and Su 2002). 3 Feature Set 3.1 Simple Deterministic Features (Fsd) The purpose of si</context>

Features Parenthesis is often used to indicate the definition of abbreviation in biomedical documents. 3. Features GreekLetter and RomanDigit are specially designed to capture the symbols frequently occurred in biomedical NE. 4. Feature ATCG sequence identify the similarity of words according to their word formations, e.g. AACAAAG, CTCAGGA, etc. 5. Features dealing with mixed alphabets and digits such as AlphaDigitAlpha, CapMixAlpha, etc. are beneficial for biomedical abbreviations. Furthermore, we evaluate these features and compare with those used in MUC (Zhou and Su, 2002). The reported result of the simple deterministic features used in MUC can achieve Fmeasure of 74.1 (Zhou and Su 2002), but when they are used in biomedical domain, they only get F-measure of 24.3. By contrast, using the simple deterministic features we designed for biomedical NER, the system achieves F-measure of 29.4. According to the comparison, some findings may be concluded as follows: 1) Simple deterministic features are domain dependent, which suggests that it is necessary to design special features for biomedical NER. 2) Simple deterministic features have weaker predictive power for NE</context>

In our system, totally 37 prefixes and suffixes were selected and grouped to 23 features. 3.3 Part-of-Speech Features (Fpos) In the previous NER research in newswire domain, part-of-speech (POS) features were stated not useful, as POS features may affect the use of some important capitalization information (Zhou and Su 2002). However, since more and more words with lower case are included in NEs, capitalization information in biomedical domain is not as evidential as it in newswire domain (Zhang et al. 2003). Moreover, since many biomedical NEs are descriptive and long, identifying NE boundary is not a trivial task. POS tagging can provide the evidence of noun phrase region based on word syntactic information and the noun phrases are most likely to be NE. Therefore, we reconsidered the POS tagging. In previous research, (Kazama et al. 2002) make use of POS information and conclude that it only slightly improves p</context>

In our current system, we incorporate a method to classify abbreviation by mapping the abbreviation to its full form. This approach is based on the assumption that it is easier to classify the full form than abbreviation. In most cases, this assumption is valid because the full form has more evidences than its abbreviation to capture the NE class. Moreover, if we can map the abbreviation to its full form in the current document, the recognized abbreviation is still helpful for classifying the same forthcoming abbreviations in the same document, as in (Zhou and Su 2002). In practice, abbreviation and its full form often occur simultaneously with parenthesis when first appear in biomedical documents. There are two cases: 1. full form (abbreviation) 2. abbreviation (full form) Most patterns conform to the first case and if the content inside the parenthesis includes more than two words, the second case is assumed (Schwartz and Hearst 2003). In these two cases, the use of parenthesis is both evidential and confusing. On one hand, it is evidential because it can provide the indication to map the abbreviation to its full form. On the other hand, it is confusing b</context>
