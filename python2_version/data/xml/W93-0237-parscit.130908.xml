The IMAGENE project has studied the expression of actions in the context of instructional
text generation. The approach employs a rather traditional interpretation of Rhetorical Structure
Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1989), using it both as a descriptive tool and as a constructive
tool (Mann and Thompson, 1987). No explicit representation of and reasoning about intentions
was employed. In this light, the project can serve as a data point in the broader discussion of the
use of rhetorical relations and of their interaction with intentions.
This contribution will begin with a brief overview of the IMAGENE project&apos;, focusing on the
nature of the use of RST in the project and, in particular, on the procedural basis of the inventory
of rhetorical relations employed. It will conclude with a discussion of the precise characteristics
of the project that appear to have warranted the lack of specific concern with intentions.

The Use of Relations

<bodyText confidence="0.999890882352941">
In the IMAGENE project, instructional text is taken to refer exclusively to written, procedural direc-
tions prescribing the performance some sequence of actions to the reader. This type of text can
be seen as the expression of a set of actions bearing procedural relationships with one another. In
this light, two tasks that an instructional text generator must perform are, first, to choose, for each
action expression, the rhetorical relation it will hold with the other actions that best conveys their
procedural relationships, and, secondly, to choose the precise grammatical form that will signal
this rhetorical relation.
It is tempting to address these two tasks at an intuitive level, identifying both the rhetorical
status and the grammatical form that appear to most effectively express various types of actions
and their relations. The problem with this approach is that it is unclear how accurate our intuitions
in this matter are. As an alternative, the IMAGENE project was based on a detailed function to
form study of a corpus of instructional texts, currently made up of approximately 1000 clauses
of instructional text (6000 words) taken from manuals and instructions concerning a variety of
devices and processes, taken from 17 different sources2. This corpus is represented in a relational
database representing the rhetorical and grammatical aspects of the text.
The corpus was analyzed and RST structures were built for all of the text. This analysis of
rhetorical status made use of three nucleus-satellite relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, and

two joint schemas: Sequence and Concurrent. The Purpose relation and the Sequence schema
are taken directly from the RST specification. The Precondition and Result relations are simple
amalgams of Circumstance and Condition, and Volitional and Non-Volitional Result respectively.
The Concurrent schema is a simple extension of the Sequence schema.
As an example, consider the following passage from a telephone instruction manual:
[1] When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) [2] remove phone [3] by firmly grasping top of
handset [4] and pulling out. [5] Return to seat [6] to place calls.
The RST analysis for this text is shown in Figure 1. The procedural relationships that lie behind
the expressions in this passage are shown in Figure 2.
This set of relations and schemas, which has proven effective in analyzing instructional text,
is based on the notions of hierarchical and non-linear plans and the use of preconditions and
postconditions in automated planners3. During descriptive analysis, Purpose is identified with the
expression of what is called the generation relationship (Goldman, 1970). Precondition and Result

are identified with the expression of actions as pre or post-conditions for other actions. Sequence
schemas are identified with the expression of sequential actions and, similarly, Concurrent schemas
with the expression of concurrency.
Given this coding of the rhetorical status of action expressions, coupled with the coding of
the grammatical form of the expressions, a functional analysis was performed which identified
systematic co-variation between functions and forms in the corpus. It turned out that a set of
approximately 70 features of the communicative environment — in terms of Systemic-Functional
Linguistics, elements of the ideational, textual, and interpersonal metafunctions (Halliday, 1985)
— were sufficient to produce a broad analytical coverage of the rhetorical status and grammatical
forms used in the corpus. These features were then coded in a single system network which
formed the basis of the constructive use of RST within the IMAGENE instructional text generation
system.

Where Intentions Fit In

Given that Moore and Pollack&apos;s (1992) examples of the need for simultaneous representation of
relations and intentions are so compelling, there must some explanation of why the IMAGENE
project was successful within the orthodox RST tradition. This concluding section will suggest
two characteristics of the IMAGENE study that appear to have been instrumental in this regard and
discuss their implications for the appropriate roles of relations and intentions.
The first characteristic of the IMAGENE project was its focus on local rhetorical relations in
written instructional text in English. There are a number of sub-issues related to this focus of
concern, all of which tend to lend themselves to a traditional RST approach:
Written rather than interactive discourse — A number of studies in the context of interactive
discourse have emphasized the need for separate representation of intentions (Fox, 1988;
Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Moore and Paris, 1989). This mechanism allows the system to deal
with, for example, conversational repair, an issue which is not prevalent in written text.
Instructional text rather than other genres — Instructional text does not tend to make use of the
deep and multi-faceted intentions that are common in argumentative and persuasive text
(such as was the case in the &amp;quot;Come home by 5:00&amp;quot; example cited by Moore and Pollack).
Instructional texts tend to be more straight forward expressions of actions and the procedural
relations among them. In fact, the definition of the instructional genre itself makes reference
to the single fundamental intention of expressing a procedure in an effective way (termed
the &amp;quot;deep&amp;quot; intention by Delin et al. (1993)), an intention which has manifested itself in a
number of standardized, domain-specific forms of expression commonly used by technical
writers (termed Domain Communication Knowledge by Kittredge et al. (1991)).
Local rather than global relations — Not only did the IMAGENE project specifically address in-
structional text, but it has exclusively addressed the use of local rhetorical relations. Quite
often the difficulty observed with RST analyses has been at higher levels.
The second, and perhaps most significant characteristic of the IMAGENE project is its focus on
the problems of rhetorical status selection and grammatical form selection. No attempt was made
to address the issue of content selection, indeed the corpus-based methodology employed would
not provide a completely satisfying basis on which to address this issue. IMAGENE takes as input
a process structure, such as the one shown in Figure 2, and does very little reasoning concerning

what to say (aside from pruning the process tree structure in some cases). This issue of content
selection appears to be a crucial contribution of intentions.

The first characteristic of the IMAGENE project was its focus on local rhetorical relations in written instructional text in English. There are a number of sub-issues related to this focus of concern, all of which tend to lend themselves to a traditional RST approach: Written rather than interactive discourse — A number of studies in the context of interactive discourse have emphasized the need for separate representation of intentions (Fox, 1988; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Moore and Paris, 1989). This mechanism allows the system to deal with, for example, conversational repair, an issue which is not prevalent in written text. Instructional text rather than other genres — Instructional text does not tend to make use of the deep and multi-faceted intentions that are common in argumentative and persuasive text (such as was the case in the &amp;quot;Come home by 5:00&amp;quot; example cited by Moore and Pollack). Instructional texts tend to be more straight forward expressions of actions and the procedural relations among them. In fact, the definition of the instructional genre itself makes reference to t</context>
