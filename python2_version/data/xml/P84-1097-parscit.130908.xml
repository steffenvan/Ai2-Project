A dictionary is an extremely valuable reference book, but its
familiarity tends to blind adults to the high level of intelligence
required to read it. This aspect becomes apparent, however,
when school children are observed learning dictionary skills.
Children do not respect syntactic category and often wander
into the wrong lexical entry, apparently in search of something
they can understand. They also find it difficult to match the
sense of a polysemous word to the context of a particular
passage. And they repeatedly assume that some familiar word
in a definition can be substituted for the unfamiliar word it
defines.
The lexical information that children need can be provided
better by a computer than by a book, but that remedy will not
be realized if automated dictionaries are merely machine-
readable versions of the standard printed dictionaries. Some
suggestions for computer-based lexical reference systems will be
offered.
