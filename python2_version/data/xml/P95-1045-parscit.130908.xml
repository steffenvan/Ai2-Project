We extract from sentences a superstruc-
ture made of argumentative operators and
connectives applying to the remaining set
of terminal sub-sentences. We found the
argumentative interpretation of utterances
on a semantics defined at the linguistic le-
vel. We describe the computation of this
particular semantics, based on the cons-
traints that the superstructure impels to
the argumentative power of terminal sub-
sentences.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9385452">
Certain utterance structures contain linguistic clues
that constrain their interpretation on an argumen-
tative basis. The following example illustrates these
constraints:
I was robbed yesterday...

(3) ...but unfortunately I had little money.

We describe and compute the signification of such
sentences by specifying how the key words (in italics)
constrain the argumentative power of the terminal
sub-sentences (TSS) &amp;quot;I was robbed yesterday&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;I had money&amp;quot;. They may all be interpreted in a
relevant context, but hints for recognizing the need
of an &amp;quot;odd&amp;quot; context are given. For instance, in (1)
and (2), the robbery is considered bad because of the
opposition introduced by &amp;quot;but&amp;quot;, to something con-
sidered happy because of &amp;quot;luckily&amp;quot;. Holding money
is considered good in (2) and bad in (1) because of
the general structure of the sentence and the oppo-
sition between &amp;quot;little&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a little&amp;quot;. In (3) and (4),
the robbery is considered good, while in (3) money
is normally considered good too, and in (4) (the od-
dest) it is considered bad (imagine a speaker who

usually likes to be robbed just to see the disappoint-
ment because he holds no money). We see on these
examples that TSS&apos;s are argumentatively ambiguous
and modifiers constrain them.
In this paper we propose, for a given utterance,
the construction of the signification of the under-
lying sentence, which captures its polyphonic and
argumentative aspects. The signification of a sent-
ence is viewed as the application of an argumentative
super-structure to the signification of TSS&apos;s, free of
operators or connectives. The signification must fi-
nally be interpreted in the context of the utterance.

2 Linguistic Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998952931034483">
Our model rests on a framework inspired by Ducrot
(1980). He defines an utterance as a concrete occur-
rence of an abstract entity called a sentence. Under-
standing an utterance means computing its meaning,
which may be formalized in different contexts (such
as speech acts or beliefs). The meaning is built from
the context and from the signification of the sent-
ence which iescribes all potential uses of the lin-
guistic matter. Ducrot&apos;s integrated pragmatics also
claims that many phenomena usually described at
the pragmatic level, must be described in the signi-
fication (such as argumentation).
Within Ducrot&apos;s framework, we use his theory of
polyphony, topoi and modifiers. Polyphony is a
theory that models utterances with three levels of
characters. The talking subject refers to the per-
son who pronounced the words. The talking subject
introduces the speaker to whom the words are at-
tributed (different from the talking subject in some
cases such as indirect speech). Sentences contain li-
teral semantic contents, each one being under the
responsibility of an utterer. The relation between
the speaker of a sentence and the utterer of a con-
tent defines the commitment of the speaker to such
a semantic content. This commitment takes one of
the following values: identification (ID), opposition
(oPP) and partial commitment (Pc) (Ducrot, 1984;
Grandchamp, 1994).
Sentences are chained under linguistic warrants

called topoi (plural of topos). Topoi are found in
words. In a sentence or a combination of sentences,
some topoi are selected, others are not relevant to
the discourse context. In the interpretative process,
still others will be eliminated because of irrelevance
to the situation. A topos is selected under one of
its topical forms, made up of a direction (positive or
negative) and other parameters. The topical form is
selected with a given strength. For instance, there is
a topos T linking wealth to acquisitions. The word
&amp;quot;rich&amp;quot; may be seen as the positive form of T that
says &amp;quot;when you are rich you may buy a lot of things&amp;quot;.
The word &amp;quot;poor&amp;quot; contains the negative form of the
same topos T, that is &amp;quot;when you are not rich you
may not buy a lot of things&amp;quot;. Unlike the warrants of
Tou1min (1958), topoi are not logic warrants. They
may give some support for inferences, but do not
have to.
The strength is ruled by a subclass of operators
called modifiers, whose semantics is described pre-
cisely as modifying the strength of a selected topos.
Such words include &amp;quot;very&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;little&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a little&amp;quot;. Mo-
difiers combine with each other and with argument
sentences. The strength is specified by a lexical-
based partial ordering, producing non-quantitative
degrees similar to Klein&apos;s (1982) .

3.1 Signification of sentences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993111111111">
We have discarded the utterance/sentence level of
polyphony in order to simplify the presentation. Gi-
ven a set of topoi T, a set of strength markers F, the
set D={positive, negative} of directions, and the set
V={1D,Pc,oPP} of polyphonic values, we define the
set C=TxF xDxV of argumentative cells: the topos,
its direction, the strength and the polyphonic com-
mitment. The signification of a sentence is defined
as a disjunction of subsets of C.

3.2 Syntax

<bodyText confidence="0.999991181818182">
Given a sentence, we identify operators, connectives
and modifiers, and build the A-structure of the sent-
ence linking these linguistic clues to the TSS&apos;s. A
sample A-structure is given in Figure 1. Connecti-
ves constrain a pair of sentences or a sentence and
a discursive environment, operators constrain argu-
mentative power, and modifiers constrain only ar-
gumentative orientation and strength. In addition,
connectives and operators also specify the commit-
ment of the speaker to semantic contents, by means
of the theory of polyphony.

A TSS has a semantics that is described in terms
of predications, all but one being marked by pre-
supposition. The semantics of each predication is
described as a set of argumentative cells. Connecti-

the signification in terms of functional transforma-
tions of the signification along the four dimensions
of the cells. The signification of TSS is assumed to
be computed from the lexicon by a compositional
process.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997239">
3.4 Argumentative structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979055555556">
The A-structure is then considered as the applica-
tion of an argumentative structure (made of modi-
fiers, operators and connectives) to a vector of TSS&apos;s.
The signification of a complete sentence is computed
as the application of what we call the 4:i-structure.
A 4,-structure is a function that takes as many argu-
ments as there are TSS&apos;s, and is defined by using ba-
sic functions that are also used for the description of
operators and connectives. Examples of basic func-
tions that operate cell by cell are the modification of
the polyphonic value, the direction or the strength.
Examples of basic functions that operate on a set
of cells are the selection of cells with a given poly-
phonic value, topos or direction. The di-structure
is computed recursively on the A-structure. As the
identification or the contribution of an operator may
be ambiguous, the (1)-structures may contain disjunc-
tions.

3.5 Computation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955666666667">
Given a se4tence, its (ambiguous) A- and (1)-
structures are computed. In the normal bottom-up
process, the signification of TSS&apos;s is computed, and
the 4)-structure is applied. The result is the (ambi-
guous) signification of the complete sentence.
If the signification of TSS&apos;s reflects their &amp;quot;stan-
dard&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;literal&amp;quot; potential, the normal bottom-up
process may fail. We wish to design (I)-structures so
that they may be used for two additional tasks that
may require a top-down process: (1) accept TSS de-
scriptions containing free variables, and produce the
sets of constraints on them that lead to a solution;
(2) provide the interpretation process with a way of
generating &amp;quot;unusual significations&amp;quot; of TSS&apos;s requi-
red by the global effect of the &lt;I.-structure.

Connective &amp;quot;but&amp;quot;: the signification of &amp;quot;P1 but
P2&amp;quot; is computed from the significations of P1 and
P2, with the following modifications: generate al-
ternatives according to a partition of topoi of P1
and P2 (whose cells have free commitment varia-
bles) with the &amp;quot;opposite&amp;quot; relation which holds in T;
in each alternative, commit the corresponding cells
with the value PC for P1 and ID for P2. &amp;quot;P1 but P2&amp;quot;
will argue in the same way as P2 alone, based on a
topos that can be opposed to one of P1.
Modifier &amp;quot;a little&amp;quot;: the signification of &amp;quot;a little
P&amp;quot; is the one of P where the strength of all cells is
attenuated.
Modifier &amp;quot;little&amp;quot;: the signification of &amp;quot;little P&amp;quot;
changes the direction of the cells into the converse
value (anti-orientation).
TSS &amp;quot;John stopped smoking&amp;quot;: its signification
is formed of two sets of cells, the commitment value
being fixed to PC for the cells from the presupposed
predication [John smoked before] and left free for
the main predication [John does not smoke now].

5 Interpretation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985923076923">
The signification of TSS&apos;s, connectives, and opera-
tors may contain instructions referring to the con-
text for the attribution of values. The interpretative
process must fill these holes. It also further selects
in the sets of topoi those connected to the situation.
It drives the top-down process for generating data
corresponding to &amp;quot;odd&amp;quot; contexts.
We claim that the argumentative structure of
sentences is never questioned by the interpretative
process, that it fully captures the argumentative po-
tential of the sentence and that it is reliable. The
signification is then a firm base for the computation
of the meaning.

Most works on argumentation define links between
propositions at a logical level, so that linguistic stu-
dies focus on pragmatics rather than semantics (Co-
-hen, 1987). Some ideas of Ducrot were already used
in systems: argumentative orientation (Guez, 1990)
and polyphony (Elhadad and McKeown, 1990). Be-
sides, Raccah (1990) develops argumentative seman-
tics without the need of a theory of utterance.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977416666667">
We have isolated a semantic module which allows the
interpretation process to take into account the ar-
gumentative constraints imposed by linguistic clues.
We designed this module so that it starts from le-
xical descriptions which we are able to provide ma-
nually, and produces a structure whose interpreta-
tion can be computed. Remaining difficulties lay in
the linguistic theories themselves (mainly combining
modifiers and cataloguing topoi), the signification of
TSS&apos;s (which should be compositional) and the inte-
gration of argumentative semantics with informative
and illocutionary elements.
