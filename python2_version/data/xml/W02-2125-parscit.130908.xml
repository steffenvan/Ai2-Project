This paper describes Generation-
Heavy Hybrid Machine Translation
(GHMT), a novel approach for trans-
lating between structurally-divergent
language pairs with asymmetrical
resources. The approach depends
ort the existence of rich target lan-
guage resources such as word lexical
semantics, categorial variations and
subcategorization frames. These
resources are used to overgenerate
multiple lexico-structural variations
from a target-glossed syntactic de-
pendency representation of the source
language sentence. This symbolic
overgeneration, which accounts for a
wide range of possible variations, is
constrained by a statistical target-
language model. The exploitation of
target language resources (symbolic
and statistical) to handle a problem
usually reserved for Transfer and In-
terlingual MT is useful for translation
from source languages with scarce
linguistic resources. A preliminary
evaluation ort the application of this
approach to Spanish-English MT is
conducted with promising results.

(GHMT) is a novel approach for translat-
ing between structurally-divergent language
pairs with asymmetrical resources. In this
model, the generation component is what
constrains the translation using a combination
of symbolic rules, lexicons, and corpus-based
statistics. The source language (SL) is only
expected to have a syntactic parser and a simple
one-to-many translation lexicon. No transfer
rules or complex interlingual representations are
used. The approach depends ort the existence
of rich target language (TL) resources such as
word lexical semantics, categorial variations and
subcategorization frames. These resources are
used to generate multiple structural variations
from a target-glossed syntactic dependency
representation of SL sentences. This symbolic
overgeneration, which accounts for possible
translation divergences, is constrained by a
statistical TL model. The exploitation of TL
resources (symbolic and statistical) to handle
a problem usually reserved for Transfer and
Interlingual MT is useful for translation from
structurally divergent SLs with scarce linguistic
resources. A preliminary evaluation ort the
application of this approach to Spanish-English
MT proves it extremely promising.
The next section describes the range of di-
vergence types covered in this work and dis-
cusses previous approaches to handling them.
Section (3) describes the different components
and algorithms in the translation system. And
finally, Section (4) describes a preliminary eval-
uation undertook to assess the applicability of
this approach to Spanish-English MT.

2 Translation Divergences
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957071428572">
A translation divergence occurs when the un-
derlying concept or &amp;quot;gist&amp;quot; of a sentence is dis-
tributed over different words for different lan-
guages. For example, the notion of floating
across a river is expressed as float across a river
in English and cross a river floating (atraveso el
rio flotando) in Spanish (Dorr, 1993). Art inves-
tigation done by (Dorr et al., 2002) found that
divergences occurred in approximately 1 out of
every 3 sentences in a sample size of 19K sen-
tences from the TREC El Norte Newspaper Cor-
pus. This analysis was done ort the TREC Span-
ish Datal using automatic detection techniques
followed by human confirmation.

2.1 Translation Divergence Types
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.93354">
Translation divergences can be classified in
terms of five specific divergence types that can
take place alone or jointly.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96081552">
1. The categorial divergence involves a trans-
lation that uses different parts of speech,
e.g., &apos;hungry&apos; as &apos;hunger&apos;. This is by far the
most common divergence type, overlapping
almost completely with all other divergence
types.
2. The conflational divergence involves the
translation of two words using a single word
that combines their meaning, e.g., &apos;stab&apos; as
&apos;give stabs&apos; or &apos;butter&apos; as &apos;put butter&apos;.
3. The structural divergence involves the real-
ization of incorporated arguments such as
subject and object as obliques (i.e. headed
by a preposition in a PP) or vice versa.
4. The head swapping divergence involves the
demotion of the head verb and the promo-
tion of one of its modifiers to head position.
lit Spanish, this divergence is typical in the
translation of art English motion verb (e.g.
&apos;float&apos;) and a preposition (e.g. &apos;across&apos;) as a
directed motion verb and a progressive verb
(`cross floating&apos;).
5. The thematic divergence occurs when the
linking between syntactic arguments and
thematic roles is switched during the trans-

lation from one language to another. The
Spanish verbs gustar (`-to like&apos;) and doler
(`-to hurt&apos;) are examples of this case.

2.2 Handling Translation Divergences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989449340909091">
Since translation divergences require a combi-
nation of lexical and structural manipulation,
they are traditionally handled at the transfer
or interlingual levels of the MT Hierarchy. A
pure brute-force transfer approach attempts to
encode all translation divergences in a lexicon
11.1)C catalog no LDC2000T51, ISBN 1-58563-177-9,
2000.
of transfer rules (Han et al., 2000). Very large
parsed and aligned bilingual corpora have also
been used to automatically extract transfer rules
(Lavoie et al., 2001). This approach depends
ort the availability of such resources, which are
very scarce. However, more sophisticated tech-
niques have been developed that use lexical se-
mantic knowledge to detect and handle these
phenomena. For example, one interlingual ap-
proach, proposed by (Dori., 1993), uses Jackend-
off&apos;s Lexical Semantic Structure (LCS) (Jack-
endoff, 1983) as art interlingua. An alterna-
tive approach using lexico-structural transfer en-
riched with lexical semantic features that cap-
ture generalizations across the language pair was
proposed by (Nasr et al., 1997). A major
limitation of the interlingual and transfer ap-
proaches is that they require a large amount of
explicit lexical semantic knowledge for both SL
and TL.
We adopt art alternative approach called
Generation-Heavy Machine Translation
(GHMT) â€” described next. This approach
is closely related to the Hybrid Natural
Language Generation approach (Knight and
Hatzivassiloglou, 1995; Langkilde and Knight,
1998; Bangalore and Rambow, 2000). The
idea is to combine symbolic and statistical
knowledge in generation through a two step
process: (1) Symbolic Overgeneration followed
by (2) Statistical Extraction. The hybrid
approach has been used mainly for lexical
choice (including morphology and tense selec-
tion) from semantic representations (Langkilde
and Knight, 1998) or from shallow unlabeled
dependencies (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999160272727273">
GHMT extends the hybrid approach to han-
dle translation divergences without the use of a
deeper semantic representation or transfer rules.
This is accomplished through the inclusion of
structural and categorial expansion of SL syn-
tactic dependencies in the symbolic overgener-
ation component. The overgeneration is con-
strained by linguistically motivated rules that
utilize TL lexical semantics and subcategoriza-
tion frames and is independent of SL prefer-
ences.

This is a database of uninflected words (lexemes)
and their categorial variants3. The database was
developed using a combination of resources and
algorithms including the LCS Verb and Prepo-
sition Databases (Dori., 2001), the Brown Cor-
pus section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et
al., 1994), art English morphological analysis
lexicon developed for PC-Kimmo (ENGLEX)
(Antworth, 1990), Nomlex4 (Macleod et al.,

The Syntactic-Thematic Linking Map
This is a large matrix extracted from the LCS
Verb and Preposition Database (Dori., 2001). It
relates syntactic &amp;quot;cases&amp;quot; to thematic roles. Syn-
tactic cases include 125 prepositions in addition
to :subj, :obj, and :obj2 . These are mapped to
varying subsets of the 20 different thematic roles
used in our system. The total number of links
is 341 pairs. The following is art excerpt:

3.3 Thematic Linking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999766">
The first step in generation is to turn the syn-
tactic dependency input into a thematic depen-
dency in which all relations are thematic roles.
This step deceivingly resembles SL Analysis in
other MT approaches. However, it is not since
the linking is applied to TL words using TL re-
sources with no knowledge of SL preferences (ex-
cept through the choice of TL words used in the
translation step). This is a loose linking algo-
rithm since, for example, the TL verb thematic
grids are only used to determine the number and
nature (obligatory, optional) of thematic roles
associated with the TL verb but not how they
are linked to TL syntactic positions. TL linking
information is used in a later step â€” Syntactic

3An investigation of the existence of such a resource
shows that none is available. The WordNet project is
currently adding such links but only for Nouns and Verbs
(Christiane Fellbaum, pc.).

Assignment. Prepositions are treated as syn-
tactic case markers that constrain the option of
thematic roles that can be assigned to their ob-
jects. For example, if a certain SL preposition
is translated as the English (`-to&apos;, &apos;toward&apos;, or
&apos;at&apos;), it is safe to assume that the object of the
preposition is goal or location but not source or
purpose.
The linking algorithm is implemented as a
maximum flow network variant that uses link-
ing constraints from the verbs and prepositions
in addition to applying a Thematic Hierarchy
constraint and allowing all thematic roles to
be treated as modifiers as a back-off option.
Different linking networks are ranked with a
preference for linking obligatory thematic roles
over optional roles and syntactic arguments over
modifiers.
Figure 2 illustrates how the correct mapping
from syntax to thematic roles is done for the
two sentences Mary filled the glass with water
and Mary filled water in the glass. Although
the second sentence is not correct English (al-
beit good Korean), the correct roles are assigned
mainly because of the limitations imposed by
allowable thematic assignments for the preposi-
tion in which can only link to the goal thematic
role expected by the verb fill. The dotted lines
in Figure 2 represent all possible links. The solid
lines are the optimal linking set.
The goals of this step are (1) to reduce the
number of ambiguous verb/verb-class/thematic-
grid possibilities; (2) to normalize over struc-
tural variations resulting from structural and
thematic divergences; and (3) to provide accu-
rate thematic assignment that is essential for
structural expansion (the next step).

This step overgenerates alternative structural
configurations of the thematic dependencies.
There are two operations that are applied
here: Conflation and Head Swapping. Lexical-
semantic information from the word-class lexi-
con (theta grids and lexical conceptual primi-
tives) is used to determine the conflatability and
head-swappability of combinations of nodes in

which translates into kill cannot be generated
currently given that in our lexicon, kill and death
are not linked at all. The only verbal categorial
variation of death is deaden and that is not art
appropriate translation here. Generating a link
between deaden and kill requires another more
conceptual resource such as the Sensus Ontology
(Knight and Luk, 1994). Evert a simpler lexi-
cal database such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)
does not have a synset relating these two verbs.
Such expansion is still very much in the spirit of
generation-heavy machine translation since all
of the new knowledge is represented in the TL.
The remaining 2 cases (4%) out of the 48
sentences require pragmatic knowledge and/or
hard-wiring of idiomatic non-decompositional
structures. For example the Spanish ponerse de
pie (put-self of/on foot) should translate into to
stand up.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997925">
I have presented a novel MT approach that han-
dles translation divergences between language
pairs with asymmetrical resources without the
use of interlinguas or structural transfer rules.
Future work involves a more extensive evalua-
tion of the Spanish-English GHMT system. The
evaluation will include a test of the SL indepen-
dence claim by retargeting the system to Chi-
nese input. Extensions to both symbolic and
statistical components are also planned. They
include the use of conceptual representations
and structural 11-grams.

The database was developed using a combination of resources and algorithms including the LCS Verb and Preposition Databases (Dori., 2001), the Brown Corpus section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994), art English morphological analysis lexicon developed for PC-Kimmo (ENGLEX) (Antworth, 1990), Nomlex4 (Macleod et al., 1998) and the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980). The database contains 28,305 clusters for 46,037 words. The following is art excerpt: (3) (:V (hunger) :N (hunger) :kJ (hungry)) (:V (validate) :N (validation validity) :kJ (valid)) (:V (cross) :N (crossing cross) :P (across)) The Syntactic-Thematic Linking Map This is a large matrix extracted from the LCS Verb and Preposition Database (Dori., 2001). It relates syntactic &amp;quot;cases&amp;quot; to thematic roles. Syntactic cases include 125 prepositions in addition to :subj, :obj, and :obj2 . These are mapped to varying subsets of the 20 different thematic roles used in our system. The total number of links</context>
