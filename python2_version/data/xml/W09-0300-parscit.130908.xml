The LaTeCH–SHELT&amp;R workshop aims to present in one forum two strands of research in language
technology, which we believe have many common concerns, but also complementary viewpoints.
Museums, archives, and libraries around the world maintain large collections of cultural heritage
objects, such as archaeological artefacts, sound recordings, historical manuscripts, or preserved animal
specimens. Large scale digitization projects are currently underway to make these collections more
accessible to the public and to research. The natural next step after digitization is the development
of powerful tools to search, link, enrich, and mine the digitized data. Language technology has an
important role to play in this endeavor, even for collections which are primarily non-textual, since text
is the pervasive medium used for metadata. Two previous LaTeCH (Language Technology for Cultural
Heritage) workshops (at ACL 2007 in Prague and LREC 2008 in Marrakech) have shown that there is
an interest among language technology researchers in providing intelligent infrastructure and tools for
working with cultural heritage data.
Similarly, in research in the Social Sciences, Humanities and Education (SHE), text – and speech, i.e.,
language – are central as both primary and secondary research data sources. In today’s world, the
normal mode of access to text, speech, images and video is in digital form. Modern material is born
digital, and, as already mentioned, older material is being digitized on a vast scale in cultural heritage
and digital library projects. Language technology and language resources has an equally important role
to play here, as in the cultural heritage area, and for more or less the same purposes. A clear sign of
this is the newly launched European research infrastructure initiative CLARIN, which addresses exactly
the use of language technology and language resources as research infrastructure in the humanities and
social sciences. Against this background, it now seems natural to add a component to the workshop
reflecting this development: SHELT&amp;R (Language Technology and Resources infrastructure for text-
based research in the Social Sciences, Humanities and Education).
The CH and SHE domains are not mere passive consumers of ready-made language technology solutions.
Rather, they make up interesting and challenging testbeds, where the robustness and the generality of
existing language technology are subjected to the acid test of messy and multilingual reality, more so
than in many other application areas, since they have to deal with, inter alia, historical, non-standardized
language varieties in addition to a number of modern standard languages. Our workshop thus aims to
foster interaction between researchers working on all aspects of language technology applied to the CH
and SHE domains, and experts from institutions who are testing deployed technologies and formulating
improved use cases.
The papers accepted for the LaTeCH–SHELT&amp;R workshop after a thorough peer-review process give a
good sense of the current breadth of this exciting and expanding area. We are happy that our keynote
speakers, Dr. Martin Doerr and Dr. Tam´as V´aradi, agreed to join us and deliver excellent topics for a
complete workshop program. We would like to thank all authors who submitted papers for the hard
work that went into their submissions. We are also extremely grateful to the members of the programme
committee for providing thorough reviews and multi-faceted input.
Some of the workshop costs were covered from a project grant awarded to Lars Borin by the Swedish
Research Council (VR Dnr 2007-7430: Safeguarding the future of Spr˚akbanken), which is hereby
gratefully acknowledged.
