We describe our experience with automatic align-
ment of sentences in parallel English-Chinese
texts. Our report concerns three related topics:
(1) progress on the HKUST English-Chinese Par-
allel Bilingual Corpus; (2) experiments addressing
the applicability of Gale &amp; Church&apos;s (1991) length-

ment involving a non-Indo-European language;
and (3) an improved statistical method that also

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99965086">
Recently, a number of automatic techniques for
aligning sentences in parallel bilingual corpora
have been proposed (Kay &amp; ROscheisen 1988;
Catizone et al. 1989; Gale &amp; Church 1991; Brown
et at. 1991; Chen 1993), and coarser approaches
when sentences are difficult to identify have also
been advanced (Church 1993; Dagan el at. 1993).
Such corpora contain the same material that has
been translated by human experts into two lan-
guages. The goal of alignment is to identify match-
ing sentences between the languages. Alignment is
the first stage in extracting structural information
and statistical parameters from bilingual corpora.
The problem is made more difficult because a sen-
tence in one language may correspond to multiple
sentences in the other; worse yet, sometimes sev-
eral sentences&apos; content is distributed across multi-
ple translated sentences.
Approaches to alignment fall into two main
classes: lexical and statistical. Lexically-based
techniques use extensive online bilingual lexicons
to match sentences. In contrast, statistical tech-
niques require almost no prior knowledge and are
based solely on the lengths of sentences. The
empirical results to date suggest that statistical
methods yield performance superior to that of cur-
rently available lexical techniques.
However, as far as we know, the literature
on automatic alignment has been restricted to al-
phabetic Indo-European languages. This method-
ological flaw weakens the arguments in favor of
either approach, since it is unclear to what extent
a technique&apos;s superiority depends on the similar-
ity between related languages. The work reported
herein moves towards addressing this problem.&apos;
In this paper, we describe our experience
with automatic alignment of sentences in paral-
lel English-Chinese texts, which was performed as
part of the SILC machine translation project. Our
report concerns three related topics. In the first of
the following sections, we describe the objectives
of the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual
Corpus, and our progress. The subsequent sec-
tions report experiments addressing the applica-
bility of a suitably modified version of Gale &amp;
Church&apos;s (1991) length-based statistical method to
the task of aligning English with Chinese. In the
final section, we describe an improved statistical
method that also permits domain-specific lexical
cues to be incorporated probabilistically.

THE ENGLISH-CHINESE
CORPUS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996020214285714">
The dearth of work on non-Indo-European lan-
guages can partly be attributed to a lack of the
prequisite bilingual corpora. As a step toward
remedying this, we are in the process of construct-
ing a suitable English-Chinese corpus. To be in-
cluded, materials must contain primarily tight, lit-
eral sentence translations. This rules out most fic-
tion and literary material.
We have been concentrating on the Hong
Kong Hansard, which are the parliamentary pro-
ceedings of the Legislative Council (LegCo). Anal-
ogously to the bilingual texts of the Canadian
Hansard (Gale 8.6 Church 1991), LegCo tran-
scripts are kept in full translation in both English

plied to non-Indo-European languages in the future
(Fung &amp; Church 1994).

and Cantonese.2 However, unlike the Canadian
Hansard, the Hong Kong Hansard has not pre-
viously been available in machine-readable form.
We have obtained and converted these materials
by special arrangement.
The materials contain high-quality literal
translation. Statements in LegCo may be made
using either English or Cantonese, and are tran-
scribed in the original language. A translation to
the other language is made later to yield com-
plete parallel texts, with annotations specifying
the source language used by each speaker. Most
sentences are translated 1-for-1. A small propor-
tion are 1-for-2 or 2-for-2, and on rare occasion
1-for-3, 3-for-3, or other configurations. Samples
of the English and Chinese texts can be seen in
figures 3 and 4.3
Because of the obscure format of the origi-
nal data, it has been necessary to employ a sub-
stantial amount of automatic conversion and ref-
ormatting. Sentences are identified automatically
using heuristics that depend on punctuation and
spacing. Segmentation errors occur occasionally,
due either to typographical errors in the original
data, or to inadequacies of our automatic conver-
sion heuristics. This simply results in incorrectly
placed delimiters; it does not remove any text from
the corpus.
Although the emphasis is on clean text so
that markup is minimal, paragraphs and sentences
are marked following TEI-conformant SGML
(Sperberg-McQueen &amp; Burnard 1992). We use the
term &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; in a generalized sense including
lines in itemized lists, headings, and other non-
sentential segments smaller than a paragraph.
The corpus currently contains about 60Mb of
raw data, of which we have been concentrating
on approximately 3.2Mb. Of this, 2.1Mb is text
comprised of approximately 0.35 million English
words, with the corresponding Chinese translation
occupying the remaining 1.1Mb.

languages. Formal written Cantonese employs the
same characters as Mandarin, with some additions.
Though there are grammatical and usage differences
between the Chinese languages, as between German
and Swiss German, the written forms can be read by
all.

<bodyText confidence="0.999935272727273">
where A is an alignment, and Ti and 7-2 are the
English and Chinese texts, respectively. An align-
ment A is a set consisting of L1 ,== L2 pairs where
each L1 or L2 is an English or Chinese passage.
This formulation is so extremely general that
it is difficult to argue against its pure form. More
controversial are the approximations that must be
made to obtain a tractable version.
The first commonly made approximation is
that the probabilities of the individual aligned
pairs within an alignment are independent, i.e.,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999047">
Pr(AITI, &apos;T2) H Pr(Li L217i, 7-2)
(L1.= L2)EA
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.816283">
The other common approximation is that each
Pr(Li L2171 , 7-2) depends not on the entire
texts, but only on the contents of the specific pas-
sages within the alignment:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.772212">
Pr(AI7j,72) ff Pr(Li L2ILi, L2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.768256333333333">
Maximization of this approximation to the
alignment probabilities is easily converted into a
minimum-sum problem:

<bodyText confidence="0.999696">
The minimization can be implemented using a dy-
namic programming strategy.
Further approximations vary according to the
specific method being used. Below, we first discuss
a pure length-based approximation, then a method
with lexical extensions.

APPLICABILITY OF LENGTH-
BASED METHODS TO CHINESE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9953885">
Length-based alignment methods are based on the
following approximation to equation (2):

where l = length(Li) and /2 = length(L2), mea-
sured in number of characters. In other words,
the only feature of L1 and L2 that affects their
alignment probability is their length. Note that
there are other length-based alignment methods
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991715">
81
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999664754716981">
that measure length in number of words instead
of characters (Brown et al. 1991). However, since
Chinese text consists of an unsegmented character
stream without marked word boundaries, it would
not be possible to count the number of words in a
sentence without first parsing it.
Although it has been suggested that length-
based methods are language-independent (Gale Sz
Church 1991; Brown et al. 1991), they may in fact
rely to some extent on length correlations arising
from the historical relationships of the languages
being aligned. If translated sentences share cog-
nates, then the character lengths of those cognates
are of course correlated. Grammatical similarities
between related languages may also produce cor-
relations in sentence lengths.
Moreover, the combinatorics of non-Indo-
European languages can depart greatly from Indo-
European languages. In Chinese, the majority of
words are just one or two characters long (though
collocations up to four characters are also com-
mon). At the same time, there are several thou-
sand characters in daily use, as in conversation or
newspaper text. Such lexical differences make it
even less obvious whether pure sentence-length cri-
teria are adequately discriminating for statistical
alignment.
Our first goal, therefore, is to test whether
purely length-based alignment results can be repli-
cated for English and Chinese, languages from
unrelated families. However, before length-based
methods can be applied to Chinese, it is first nec-
essary to generalize the notion of &amp;quot;number of char-
acters&amp;quot; to Chinese strings, because most Chinese
text (including our corpus) includes occasional
English proper names and abbreviations, as well
as punctuation marks. Our approach is to count
each Chinese character as having length 2, and
each English or punctuation character as having
length 1. This corresponds to the byte count for
text stored in the hybrid English-Chinese encod-
ing system known as Big 5.
Gale &amp; Church&apos;s (1991) length-based align-
ment method is based on the model that each
English character in L1 is responsible for generat-
ing some number of characters in L2. This model
leads to a further approximation which encapsu-
lates the dependence to a single parameter .6 that
is a function of /1 and /2:
Pr(Li L2IL1, L2)&apos;,■+&apos; Pr(Li L2 I6(11, 12))
However, it is much easier to estimate the distrib-
utions for the inverted form obtained by applying
Bayes&apos; Rule:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.88933225">
Pr(Li L216) =
Pr(OlLi L2)Pr(Li L2)
,=
Pr(b)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.985818041666667">
where Pr(6) is a normalizing constant that can
be ignored during minimization. The other two
distributions are estimated as follows.
First we choose a function for 6(4,12). To
do this we look at the relation between /1 and
12 under the generative model. Figure 1 shows
a plot of English versus Chinese sentence lengths
for a hand-aligned sample of 142 sentences. If
the sentence lengths were perfectly correlated, the
points would lie on a diagonal through the origin.
We estimate the slope of this idealized diagonal
c = E(r) = E(12 1 11) by averaging over the training
corpus of hand-aligned L1 L2 pairs, weighting
by the length of Li. In fact this plot displays sub-
stantially greater scatter than the English-French
data of Gale &amp; Church (1991).4 The mean number
of Chinese characters generated by each English
character is c = 0.506, with a standard deviation
o- = 0.166.
We now assume that /2 — /1 c is normally dis-
tributed, following Gale &amp; Church (1991), and
transform it into a new gaussian variable of stan-
dard form (i.e., with mean 0 and variance 1) by
appropriate normalization:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.984982">
/2 — /1C
010.2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999030461538462">
This is the quantity that we choose to define as
6(/1,12). Consequently, for any two pairs in a pro-
posed alignment, Pr(611,1 L2) can be estimated
according to the gaussian assumption.
To check how accurate the gaussian assump-
tion is, we can use equation (4) to transform the
same training points from figure 1 and produce a
histogram. The result is shown in figure 2. Again,
the distribution deviates from a gaussian distri-
bution substantially more than Gale &amp; Church
(1991) report for French/German/English. More-
over, the distribution does not resemble any
smooth distribution at all, including the logarith-
mic normal used by Brown et al. (1991), raising
doubts about the potential performance of pure
length-based alignment.
Continuing nevertheless, to estimate the other
term Pr(Li .= L2), a prior over six classes is con-
structed, where the classes are defined by the num-
ber of passages included within L1 and L2. Table 1
shows the probabilities used. These probabilities
are taken directly from Gale &amp; Church (1991);
slightly improved performance might be obtained
by estimating these probabilities from our corpus.
The aligned results using this model were eval-
uated by hand for the entire contents of a ran-

4The difference is also partly due to the fact that
Gale &amp; Church (1991) plot paragraph lengths instead
of sentence lengths. We have chosen to plot sentence
lengths because that is what the algorithm is based
on.

1. 1MR FRED LI ( in Cantonese) :

3. I notice from your address that under the Public
Assistance Scheme, the basic rate of $825 a month for a
single adult will be increased by 15% to $950 a month.
4. However, do you know that the revised rate plus all
other grants will give each recipient no more than
$2000 a month? On average, each recipient will receive
$1600 to $1700 a month. J
5. In view of Hong Kong&apos;s prosperity and high living cost,
this figure is very ironical. J
6. May I have your views and that of the Government?
7. Do you think that a comprehensive review should be
conducted on the method of calculating public
assistance?
8. Since the basic rate is so low, it will still be far below
the current level of living even if it is further increased
by 20% to 30%. If no comprehensive review is carried
out in this aspect, this &amp;quot; safety net &amp;quot; cannot provide
any assistance at all for those who are really in need. J

12. The proposals that we make on public assistance, both
the increase in scale rates, and the relaxation of the

506 English sentences and 505 Chinese sentences.
Figure 3 shows an excerpt from this output. Most
of the true 1-for-1 pairs are aligned correctly. In
(4), two English sentences are correctly aligned
with a single Chinese sentence. However, the Eng-

then the proportion of correctly aligned pairs rises
to 95.2%, a respectable rate especially in view of
the drastic inaccuracies in the distributions as-
sumed. A detailed breakdown of the results is
shown in Table 2. For reference, results reported
for English/French generally fall between 96% and
98%. However, all of these numbers should be in-
terpreted as highly domain dependent, with very
small sample size.
The above rates are for Type I errors. The
alternative measure of accuracy on Type II er-
rors is useful for machine translation applications,
where the objective is to extract only 1-for-1 sen-
tence pairs, and to discard all others. In this case,
we are interested in the proportion of 1-for-1 out-
put pairs that are true 1-for-1 pairs. (In informa-
tion retrieval terminology, this measures precision
whereas the above measures recall.) In the test
session, 438 1-for-1 pairs were output, of which
377, or 86.1%, were true matches. Again, how-
ever, by discarding the introduction, the accuracy
rises to a surprising 96.3%.

The introductory session header exemplifies
a weakness of the pure length-based strategy,
namely, its susceptibility to long stretches of pas-
sages with roughly similar lengths. In our data
this arises from the list of council members present
and absent at each session (figure 4), but similar
stretches can arise in many other domains. In such
a situation, two slight perturbations may cause the
entire stretch of passages between the perturba-
tions to be misaligned. These perturbations can
easily arise from a number of causes, including
slight omissions or mismatches in the original par-
allel texts, a 1-for-2 translation pair preceding or
following the stretch of passages, or errors in the
heuristic segmentation preprocessing. Substantial
penalties may occur at the beginning and ending
boundaries of the misaligned region, where the
perturbations lie, but the misalignment between
those boundaries incurs little penalty, because the
mismatched passages have apparently matching
lengths. This problem is apparently exacerbated
by the non-alphabetic nature of Chinese. Because
Chinese text contains fewer characters, character
length is a less discriminating feature, varying over
a range of fewer possible discrete values than the
corresponding English. The next section discusses
a solution to this problem.
In summary, we have found that the statisti-
cal correlation of sentence lengths has a far greater
variance for our English-Chinese materials than
with the Indo-European materials used by Gale
&amp; Church (1991). Despite this, the pure length-
based method performs surprisingly well, except
for its weakness in handling long stretches of sen-
tences with close lengths.

The same dynamic programming optimization
can then be used. However, the computation and
memory costs grow linearly with the number of
lexical cues. This may not seem expensive until
one considers that the pure length-based method
only uses resources equivalent to that of a single
lexical cue. It is in fact important to choose as
few lexical cues as possible to achieve the desired
accuracy.
Given the need to minimize the number of lex-
ical cues chosen, two factors become important.
First, a lexical cue should be highly reliable, so
that violations, which waste the additional com-
putation, happen only rarely. Second, the chosen
lexical cues should occur frequently, since comput-
ing the optimization over many zero counts is not
useful. In general, these factors are quite domain-
specific, so lexical cues must be chosen for the par-
ticular corpus at hand. Note further that when
these conditions are met, the exact probability dis-
tribution for the lexical Si parameters does not
have much influence on the preferred alignment.
The bilingual correspondence lexicons we have
employed are shown in figure 5. These lexical
items are quite common in the LegCo domain.
Items like &amp;quot;C.B.E.&amp;quot; stand for honorific titles such
as &amp;quot;Commander of the British Empire&amp;quot;; the other
cues are self-explanatory. The cues nearly always
appear 1-to-1 and the differences Oi therefore have

a mean of zero. Given the relative unimportance
of the exact distributions, all were simply assumed
to be normally distributed with a variance of 0.07
instead of sampling each parameter individually.
This variance is fairly sharp, but nonetheless, con-
servatively reflects a lower reliability than most of
the cues actually possess.
Using the lexical cue extensions, the Type I
results on the same test file rise to 92.1% of true
L1 L2 pairs correctly identified, as compared to
86.4% for the pure length-based method. The im-
provement is entirely in the introductory session
header. Without the header, the rate is 95.0% as
compared to 95.2% earlier (the discrepancy is in-
significant and is due to somewhat arbitrary deci-
sions made on anomolous regions). Again, caution
should be exercised in interpreting these percent-
ages.
By the alternative Type II measure, 96.1%
of the output 1-for-1 pairs were true matches,
compared to 86.1% using the pure length-based
method. Again, there is an insignificant drop
when the header is discarded, in this case from
96.3% down to 95.8%.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977130434783">
Of our raw corpus data, we have currently aligned
approximately 3.5Mb of combined English and
Chinese texts. This has yielded 10,423 pairs clas-
sified as 1-for-1, which we are using to extract
more refined information. This data represents
over 0.217 million English words (about 1.269Mb)
plus the corresponding Chinese text (0.659Mb).
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale
empirical demonstration that a pure length-based
method can yield high accuracy sentence align-
ments between parallel texts in Indo-European
and entirely dissimilar non-alphabetic, non-Indo-
European languages. We are encouraged by the
results and plan to expand our program in this
direction.
We have also obtained highly promising im-
provements by hybridizing lexical and length-
based alignment methods within a common sta-
tistical framework. Though they are particularly
useful for non-alphabetic languages where charac-
ter length is not as discriminating a feature, we be-
lieve improvements will result even when applied
to alphabetic languages.
