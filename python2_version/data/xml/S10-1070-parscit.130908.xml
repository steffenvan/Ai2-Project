The system described in this paper has par-
ticipated in the Tempeval 2 competition,
specifically in the Task A, which aim is
to determine the extent of the time expres-
sions in a text as defined by the TimeML
TIMEX3 tag, and the value of the fea-
tures type and val. For this purpose, a
combination of TERSEO system and the
T2T3 Transducer was used. TERSEO sys-
tem is able to annotate text with TIDES
TIMEX2 tags, and T2T3 transducer per-
forms the translation from this TIMEX2

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999886746031746">
Identification and extraction of explicit and im-
plicit temporal information has become a very im-
portant field of research within the computational
linguistics area since some years ago (Allen, 1983)
(Allen, 1984). Moreover, a large number of NLP
applications are exploiting this extracted informa-
tion, such as question answering and summariza-
tion systems, allowing these applications to per-
form in a more complex level.
When dealing with temporal information iden-
tification and normalization, different approaches
can be taken, depending on the available resources
of the target language and the requirements of the
system being developed. The most extended ap-
proaches to the problem are: a) rule-based ap-
proaches, such as Chronos (ITC-irst): recognizes
and normalizes temporal expressions in English
and Italian (Negri, 2007); TERSEO (University of
Alicante, the system used for this work): a knowl-
edge based system for Spanish that has been auto-
matically extended to other languages, such as En-
glish, Italian and Catalan (Saquete et al., 2006), b)
machine learning approaches, such as TimexTag
(University of Amsterdam): applies data-driven
methods for recognition and normalization tasks
(Ahn et al., 2005) (Ahn, 2006); CU-TMP (Uni-
versity of Colorado): uses machine learning for
automatic annotation (Bethard and Martin, 2007),
and c) mixed combination of rules and ML ap-
proaches, such as, TempEx (MITRE Corpora-
tion): combines hand-coded patterns with ma-
chine learning rules to tag documents (TempEx,
2008) (Mani and Wilson, 2000); TARSQI (Bran-
deis University): currently uses GUTime (2008)
for temporal expression annotation, which extends
the capabilities of the TempEx tagger while gener-
ating TIMEX3 annotations (Verhagen et al., 2005).
However, whatever the approach, the output of
these systems is a standardized annotation scheme.
The most popular annotation schemes are
TIDES (Mani et al., 2001) and TimeML (Puste-
jovsky et al., 2003b). TIDES program followed
the efforts started in the context of the Message
Understanding Conference, MUC (1998), and de-
fined the TIMEX2 tag, with the goal of interpret-
ing temporal expressions within a normalized rep-
resentation of the times they denote, adopting the
ISO 8601 standard (Technical Committee ISO/TC
154, 2004). In 2004, within the ACE program, the
Time Expression Recognition and Normalization
(TERN, 2004) evaluation workshop was held, re-
quiring by the participation systems to detect and
normalize the temporal expressions mentioned in
the source data, according to the TIDES annota-
tion standard 1. In spite of the widespread use
of this annotation scheme within NLP researchers,
it is necessary to identify other types of tempo-
ral information such as events or the relations be-
tween events and temporal expressions. Motivated
by such considerations, the TimeML annotation
scheme (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a) (Pustejovsky et
al., 2005) (Lee et al., 2007) was developed, speci-
fying four major data structures (elements) for an-

2 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999884">
The system presented in this paper is a combi-
nation of two separated systems. First of all,
TERSEO system, which is a knowledge-based
system for Spanish automatically extended to En-
glish, performs an identification and normaliza-
tion of all the temporal expressions in the text, an-
notating them with TIMEX2 tags. Once the text
has been annotated with TIMEX2, the T2T3 trans-
ducer applies a set of translation rules to convert
this TIMEX2 output to a TIMEX3 output.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997399">
2.1 Description of TERSEO system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944571428572">
TERSEO system first implementation used a
hand-made knowledge database in Spanish. How-
ever, our main goal was the possibility of working
with TERSEO on a multilingual level, but building
the different knowledge databases for the new lan-
guages through the automatic acquisition of rules
(Negri et al., 2006). Therefore, it is possible to
create a multilingual system with no need of a pre-
vious knowledge of the other languages to which
TERSEO system is going to be extended. For this
purpose, an architecture similar to the one used by
EuroWordNet (Vossen, 2000) was implemented,
in order to obtain knowledge databases for the
different languages, but all of them connected
though a unit denominated TER-ILI or Temporal
Expression Rules Interlingua Index. In doing that,
TERSEO system have a new knowledge database
for each new language and is able to solve any ex-
pression in this language. Besides, the system is
easily extensible to other new languages. The out-
put of TERSEO system is following the guidelines
of TIDES annotation scheme.
This system participated in TERN2004 for En-
glish, obtaining the results shown in Table 1.
It is important to consider the results of the sys-
tem annotating TIMEX2 tags, due to the fact that
the final results after the translation depends on
how correct the annotation was made by TERSEO.

2.2 Description of T2T3 Transducer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960782">
The T2T3 Transducer, developed by University
of Alicante and Brandeis University, implements
an automatic mapping between TIDES annotation
scheme and TimeML, only in English in a first
step. This mapping is performed applying a set
of rules in two steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978279111111111">
• Step 1: Rules for the adaptation of the
extent: the temporal expression extent is
adapted from TIMEX2 to TIMEX3. The ex-
tension of the expression is related to recog-
nition of the expression. Most expressions
which are considered as markable in TIDES
are also considered as markable in TimeML.
However, TimeML differs from TIDES with
respect to the tag span in some cases. There-
fore, following the outline of both TIDES
2005 guidelines2 and TimeML 1.2.1 guide-
lines3, a mapping is performed in order to
properly adapt the TIMEX2 extent to the
TIMEX3 extent. Besides, all the possible
adaptations from one scheme to the other are
clustered in a set of transformation rules.
• Step 2: Rules for the transformation of
the attributes: TIMEX2 attributes are trans-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.82870025">
formed to TIMEX3 attributes. The attributes
are related to normalization of the expres-
sion. The transducer has one rule for each
TimeML TIMEX3 attribute, extracting and
combining the information provided by the
TIMEX2 attributes of each temporal expres-
sion. In Tempeval 2 competition only type
and val attributes are considered. Therefore,
only these two transformation rules are pre-
sented here:
– Attribute type: The Type Assignment
rule defines the following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9977973125">
1. If the &lt;TIMEX2&gt; tag has a SET at-
tribute which value is ”YES”, then
type=&amp;quot;SET&amp;quot; must be added to the
TIMEX3 tag.
2. If the VAL attribute of the
&lt;TIMEX2&gt; tag starts with ”P”,
then type=&amp;quot;DURATION&amp;quot; must be
added to the TIMEX3 tag.
3. If the VAL attribute of the
&lt;TIMEX2&gt; tag contains a ”T”,
then type=&amp;quot;TIME&amp;quot; must be added
to the TIMEX3 tag.
4. In any other case, type=&amp;quot;DATE&amp;quot;
must be added to the TIMEX3 tag.
– Attribute value: The attribute value
is equivalent to the VAL attribute in

TIMEX2 in most cases. Therefore, in
general, the translation is direct. How-
ever, there is an exception to this rule in
the case of time-anchored expressions.
Whereas in TimeML, the value of the
head expression is always a period, ac-
cording to TIDES, there are two differ-
ent types of time-anchored expressions:
a) Anchored point expressions and b)
Anchored duration expressions. There-
fore, when the T2T3 transducer detects
one of these anchored point expressions,
a special treatment with the TIMEX2 at-
tributes is performed in order to obtain
the proper period value. Moreover, the
”DURATION” type is established for
the expression.

In this section all the evaluation results for Task A
in English are presented. Table 2 shows the results
of the system using the trial corpus provided by
the organization, the results of the system using
the first delivered training corpus and the whole
training data, and finally, the score of the system
with the test corpus. Accuracy value is not given
in the test results and it can not be calculated from
the results data provided.
As shown in the results of the different evalu-
ations, test results are very similar to training re-
sults, what means that the system is performing
steadily. Besides, in the test evaluation, the type
attribute result is the best one obtained, being close
to 100%. It would be interesting to have the corpus
annotated also with TIMEX2 in order to determine
which errors derive from TERSEO and which er-
rors derive from the Transducer.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994675">
Our participation in Tempeval 2 competition was
only in Task A, due to the fact that the system pre-
sented is a extension of TERSEO system, which
only performs identification and normalization of
temporal expressions generating TIMEX2 annota-
tion output. Events and links are out of the scope
of this system currently.
However, our motivation for participating in
Tempeval 2 competition was the possibility to de-
termine the performance of the extension applied
to TERSEO, by means of a transducer that is able
to convert TIMEX2 annotation to TIMEX3, only
using the information of the TIMEX2 tags as in-
put. The transducer applies a set of rules, in order
to transform the extent of the temporal expression
according to TimeML annotation guidelines, and
a set of rules to translate the TIMEX2 attributes
to the attributes established by TimeML also. It
is important to consider that TERSEO system is
a knowledge-based system, with hand-made rules
for Spanish. These rules were automatically ex-
tended to other languages (English is one of them)
using only automatic resources and without man-
ual revision. This automatic extension is very in-
teresting since it is possible to create a new knowl-
edge for the system very fast and with satisfactory
results.
The results of the evaluation of this combination
(TERSEO + T2T3 Transducer) are 76% precision,
66% recall and 71% F1-Measure. For the case of
the attributes, it obtained 98% for type and 65%
for value.

Once the text has been annotated with TIMEX2, the T2T3 transducer applies a set of translation rules to convert this TIMEX2 output to a TIMEX3 output. 2.1 Description of TERSEO system TERSEO system first implementation used a hand-made knowledge database in Spanish. However, our main goal was the possibility of working with TERSEO on a multilingual level, but building the different knowledge databases for the new languages through the automatic acquisition of rules (Negri et al., 2006). Therefore, it is possible to create a multilingual system with no need of a previous knowledge of the other languages to which TERSEO system is going to be extended. For this purpose, an architecture similar to the one used by EuroWordNet (Vossen, 2000) was implemented, in order to obtain knowledge databases for the different languages, but all of them connected though a unit denominated TER-ILI or Temporal Expression Rules Interlingua Index. In doing that, TERSEO system have a new knowledge database for each new language and is able to solve any expression in this language. Besides, the sys</context>

When dealing with temporal information identification and normalization, different approaches can be taken, depending on the available resources of the target language and the requirements of the system being developed. The most extended approaches to the problem are: a) rule-based approaches, such as Chronos (ITC-irst): recognizes and normalizes temporal expressions in English and Italian (Negri, 2007); TERSEO (University of Alicante, the system used for this work): a knowledge based system for Spanish that has been automatically extended to other languages, such as English, Italian and Catalan (Saquete et al., 2006), b) machine learning approaches, such as TimexTag (University of Amsterdam): applies data-driven methods for recognition and normalization tasks (Ahn et al., 2005) (Ahn, 2006); CU-TMP (University of Colorado): uses machine learning for automatic annotation (Bethard and Martin, 2007), and c) mixed combination of rules and ML approaches, such as, TempEx (MITRE Corporation): combi</context>

However, our main goal was the possibility of working with TERSEO on a multilingual level, but building the different knowledge databases for the new languages through the automatic acquisition of rules (Negri et al., 2006). Therefore, it is possible to create a multilingual system with no need of a previous knowledge of the other languages to which TERSEO system is going to be extended. For this purpose, an architecture similar to the one used by EuroWordNet (Vossen, 2000) was implemented, in order to obtain knowledge databases for the different languages, but all of them connected though a unit denominated TER-ILI or Temporal Expression Rules Interlingua Index. In doing that, TERSEO system have a new knowledge database for each new language and is able to solve any expression in this language. Besides, the system is easily extensible to other new languages. The output of TERSEO system is following the guidelines of TIDES annotation scheme. This system participated in TERN2004 for English, obtaining the results shown in Table 1.
