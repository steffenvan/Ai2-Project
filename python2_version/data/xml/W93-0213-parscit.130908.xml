&apos;Relation based&apos; approaches to discourse analysis and text generation suffer from a com-
mon problem: there is considerable disagreement between researchers over the set of relations
which is proposed. Few researchers use identical sets of relations, and many use relations
not found in any other sets. This proliferation of relations has been pointed out before (eg
Hovy [1]), and several methods for justifying a standard set of relations have been proposed:
this paper reviews some of these, and presents a new method of justification which overcomes
some awkward problems.

1 Current Approaches to Justifying a Set of Relations
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.824759">
Descriptive Adequacy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9956411">
Clearly, a set of relations must have &apos;good coverage&apos;—it must be possible to analyse all the
texts of the kind targeted using the specified relations. At the same time, this cannot be
the only requirement on a set of relations, because many different sets of relations can be
used to describe the same set of texts. For instance, the level of detail of the description
is not constrained: how do we decide whether or not to subdivide RESULT into VOLITIONAL
RESULT and NON-VOLITIONAL RESULT? Again, different cuts through the space of relations
are possible: why distinguish between VOLITIONAL and NON-VOLITIONAL result, and not
between, say, IMMEDIATE and DELAYED result? In fact the notion of &apos;descriptive adequacy&apos;
seems to make little sense in isolation: in addition, it is necessary to specify a purpose for
which the proposed description is adequate.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992526">
Psychological Reality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9972204">
One way that a purpose can be specified is by stipulating that relations model &apos;cognitive&apos;
constructs—that is, constructs which people actually use when they create and interpret
text. On this conception, a description of the relations in a text becomes part of a theory
of how the text originated, and why it is the way it is. This stipulation gives relations real
explanatory power in a theory of discourse coherence: we could argue that it is because a

given set of relations is involved in text processing that we are able to use them to describe
text.
Claiming psychological reality for relations makes them amenable to empirical investiga-
tion. Sanders, Spooren and Noordman [3] make the claim explicitly, and seek evidence for
their proposed set of relations in psychological experiments on readers and writers. But these
experiments are not without their own problems—it is questionable whether empirical exper-
iment is a sharp enough tool to reveal fine-grained distinctions between relations. (Automatic
text generation is one area where such fine-grained distinctions might well be necessary.)
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.983507">
Cue Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99156462962963">
Cue phrases (sentence connectives such as because and nevertheless) have been another in-
fluence on the choice of a set of relations. Even in RST, where relations are defined with-
out reference to surface linguistic phenomena, many correlations exist between relations and
particular cue phrases. Hovy [I] makes more explicit use of cue phrases, taking them as
&apos;nonconclusive&apos; evidence for a taxonomy of relations.
However, while it is clear that a fine-grained classification of relations could indeed be
constructed using cue phrases, the question of why relations should be linked to cue phrases
has not been addressed in detail. Hovy&apos;s rationale concerns the practicalities of designing text
planning systems; such a pragmatic approach has its advantages, but it would nonetheless
be useful to think of a theoretical reason for linking relations to cue phrases. Without one,
relations lack the kind of explanatory power they receive when thought of as psychological
constructs.
2 Cue Phrases as Evidence for Cognitive Constructs
I have suggested (Knott and Dale [2]) that it is possible to think of cue phrases as evidence
for relations precisely if they are conceived as psychological constructs. The argument is
basically that we can expect language to contain ways of making explicit any relations which
are actually used by people when they process texts. If identifying relations is a component
of text understanding, then it makes sense for there to be ways of signalling relations directly
in text: it facilitates the tasks of both the reader and the writer.
Of course it is often possible for a reader to identify a relation without the need for textual
signals. But it seems unlikely that any relation exists that never needs to be textually marked.
Unmarked relations can only be recognised if the reader has a certain amount of background
knowledge about a text; and this knowledge can hardly be guaranteed in advance for all texts
in which the relation can appear. If relations do play a part in human text comprehension, it
is reasonable to suggest that there exists a particular linguistic formula cr expression which
can be used to distinguish each relation from all others.
This claim, if accepted, would allow a taxonomy of relations to be built which has both

fine-grained detail and explanatory power. The explanatory power comes from the conception
of relations as psychological entities: this conception in turn legitimises the use of cue phrases
as evidence for relations, allowing a detailed taxonomy to be constructed.

3 A Methodology for Deciding on a Set of Relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999890333333334">
On the basis of the above argument, a new methodology for determining a set of relations
can be proposed: in essence, a relation is included in the set if a cue phrase can be found
which picks it out. The starting point for this methodology is the assembly of a corpus of cue
phrases.
A study beginning from this point is reported in Knott and Dale [2]. We began by devising
an informal test for identifying cue phrases in naturally-occurring discourse. Using the test,
120 pages of academic articles and books were analysed, yielding a corpus of over 100 cue
phrases. Following an idea by Hovy [1], this corpus was arranged into a taxonomy of synonyms
and hyponyms: a portion of this taxonomy is shown in Figure 1.

The labels in the boxes of the taxonomy are still just informal specifications: we are
currently using the taxonomy to work out an isomorphic classification of relations, complete
with more formal definitions. It is productive to think of relations as feature-based constructs,
and of the taxonomy as an inheritance hierarchy for features, such that daughter nodes
inherit the features of their mothers, and are in addition specified for extra features. The
substitutability data could then be seen as informing a decision about which features to use
in relation definitions.
The new taxonomy of relations is likely to have much in common with other taxonomies
in the literature—although there may be some revealing additions and omissions. Indeed, the
taxonomy of cue phrases can be seen as an interesting testbed for other theories of relations:
can they explain the patterns of cue phrases which it describes?

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979">
This paper has presented a new way of justifying a set of relations, by viewing them as
modelling psychological constructs and using cue phrases as evidence for these constructs.
A corpus of cue phrases has been gathered and worked into a taxonomy, from which an
isomorphic taxonomy of relations can be derived.
The benefits of this methodology are considerable. To begin with, it sets out a systematic
way to decide on a set of relations: any disagreement can be traced to a particular stage in
the process, such as the decision that a word is a cue phrase, or the decision that two phrases
are synonymous. Furthermore, the assumption of psychological reality gives the relations
in the taxonomy a clear explanatory role in a theory of discourse coherence: they are not
just &apos;purely descriptive&apos; constructs. Finally, the methodology being proposed is incremental.
Many important decisions about relation definitions—whether parameters should be used,
whether intentions need to be specified separately—can be deferred until after the taxonomy
of cue phrases has been constructed: at this point, the taxonomy serves as a useful source of
evidence for such decisions.
