Determining whether a condition is historical
or recent is important for accurate results in
biomedicine. In this paper, we investigate four
types of information found in clinical text that
might be used to make this distinction. We
conducted a descriptive, exploratory study us-
ing annotation on clinical reports to determine
whether this temporal information is useful
for classifying conditions as historical or re-
cent. Our initial results suggest that few of
these feature values can be used to predict
temporal classification.

<bodyText confidence="0.999921716981132">
Clinical applications for decision support, biosur-
veillance and quality of care assessment depend on
patient data described in unstructured, free-text
reports. For instance, patient data in emergency
department reports contain valuable indicators for
biosurveillance applications that may provide early
signs and symptoms suggestive of an outbreak.
Quality assurance departments can use free-text
medical record data to assess adherence to quality
care guidelines, such as determining whether an
MI patient was given an aspirin within twenty-four
hours of arrival. In either application, one must
consider how to address the question of time, but
each of the applications requires a different level of
temporal granularity: the biosurveillance system
needs a coarse-grained temporal model that dis-
cerns whether the signs and symptoms are histori-
cal or recent. In contrast, the quality assurance
system needs a fine-grained temporal model to
identify the admission event, when (or if) aspirin
was given, and the order and duration of time be-
tween these events. One important problem in nat-
ural language processing is extracting the appro-
priate temporal granularity for a given task.
Many solutions exist for extracting temporal in-
formation, and each is designed to address ques-
tions of various degrees of temporal granularity,
including determining whether a condition is his-
torical or recent, identifying explicit temporal ex-
pressions, and identifying temporal relations
among events in text. (Chapman et al., 2007; Zhou
et al., 2008; Irvine et al., 2008; Verhagen and Pus-
tejovsky, 2008; Bramsen et al., 2006). We pre-
viously extended the NegEx algorithm in ConText,
a simple algorithm that relies on lexical cues to
determine whether a condition is historical or re-
cent (Chapman et al., 2007). However, ConText
performs with moderate recall (76%) and precision
(75%) across different report types implying that
trigger terms and simple temporal expressions are
not sufficient for the task of identifying historical
conditions.
In order to extend work in identifying historical
conditions, we conducted a detailed annotation
study of potentially useful temporal classification
features for conditions found in six genres of clini-
cal text. Our three main objectives were: (1) cha-
racterize the temporal similarity and differences
found in different genres of clinical text; (2) de-
termine which features successfully predict wheth-
er a condition is historical, and (3) compare
ConText to machine learning classifiers that ac-
count for this broader set of temporal features.

For several decades, researchers have been study-

poral models that may be useful for determining
whether a condition is historical or recent.
There are a number of automated systems for
extracting, representing, and reasoning time in a
variety of text. One system that emerged from the
AQUAINT workshops for temporal modeling of
newspaper articles is TARSQI. TARSQI processes
events annotated in text by anchoring and ordering
them with respect to nearby temporal expressions
(Verhagen and Pustejovsky, 2008). A few recent
applications, such as TimeText and TN-TIES
(Zhou et al., 2008; Irvine et al., 2008), identify
medically relevant events from clinical texts and
use temporal expressions to order the events. One
method attempts to order temporal segments of
clinical narratives (Bramsen et al., 2006). One key
difference between these previous efforts and our
work is that these systems identify all temporal
expressions from the text and attempt to order all
events. In contrast, our goal is to determine wheth-
er a clinical condition is historical or recent, so we
focus only on temporal information related to the
signs, symptoms, and diseases described in the
text. Therefore, we ignore explicit temporal ex-
pressions that do not modify clinical conditions. If
a condition does not have explicit temporal mod-
ifiers, we still attempt to determine the historical
status for that condition (e.g., “Denies cough”). In
order to improve the ability to determine whether a
condition is historical, we carried out this annota-
tion study to identify any useful temporal informa-
tion related to the clinical conditions in six clinical
genres. Building on work in this area, we explored
temporal features used in other temporal annota-
tion studies.
TimeML is a well-known standard for complex,
temporal annotation. TimeML supports the annota-
tion of events defined as “situations that happen or
occur” and temporal expressions such as dates and
durations in order to answer temporal questions
about these events and other entities in news text
(Saur´ı, et al., 2006). One notable feature of the
TimeML schema is its ability to capture verb tense
such as past or present and verb aspect such as
perfective or progressing. We annotated verb tense
and aspect in medical text according to the Time-
ML standard.
Within the medical domain, Zhou et al. (2006)
developed an annotation schema used to identify
temporal expressions and clinical events. They
measured the prevalence of explicit temporal ex-
pressions and key medical events like admission or
transfer found in discharge summaries. We used
the Zhou categorization scheme to explore tempor-
al expressions and clinical events across genres of
reports.
A few NLP systems rely on lexical cues to ad-
dress time. MediClass is a knowledge-based sys-
tem that classifies the content of an encounter
using both free-text and encoded information from
electronic medical records (Hazelhurst et al.,
2005). For example, MediClass classifies smoking
cessation care delivery events by identifying the
status of a smoker as continued, former or history
using words like continues. ConText, an extension
of the NegEx algorithm, temporally classifies con-
ditions as historical, recent, or hypothetical using
lexical cues such as history, new, and if, respec-
tively (Chapman et al., 2007). Drawing from these
applications, we used state and temporal trigger
terms like active, unchanged, and history to cap-
ture coarse, temporal information about a condi-
tion.
Temporal information may also be implied in
the document structure, particularly with regards to
the section in which the condition appears. SecTag
marks explicit and implicit sections found
throughout patient H&amp;P notes (Denny et al., 2008).
We adopted some section headers from the SecTag
terminology to annotate sections found in reports.
Our long-term goal is to build a robust temporal
classifier for information found in clinical text
where the output is classification of whether a con-
dition is historical or recent (historical categoriza-
tion). An important first step in classifying
temporality in clinical text is to identify and cha-
racterize temporal features found in clinical re-
ports. Specifically, we aim to determine which
expressions or features are predictive of historical
categorization of clinical conditions in dictated
reports.

3 Historical Assignment and Temporal
Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995325">
We conducted a descriptive, exploratory study of
temporal features found across six genres of clini-
cal reports. We had three goals related to our task
of determining whether a clinical condition was
historical or recent. First, to develop a temporal
classifier that is generalizable across report types,
we compared temporality among different genres
of clinical text. Second, to determine which fea-
tures predict whether a condition is historical or
recent, we observed common rules generated by
three different rule learners based on manually an-
notated temporal features we describe in the fol-
lowing section. Finally, we compared the
performance of ConText and automated rule learn-
ers and assessed which features may improve the
ConText algorithm.
Next, we describe the temporal features we as-
sessed for identification of historical signs, symp-
toms, or diseases, including temporal expressions,
lexical cues, verb tense and aspect, and sections.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97022652631579">
(1) Temporal Expressions: Temporal expres-
sions are time operators like dates (May 5th 2005)
and durations (for past two days), as well as clini-
cal processes related to the encounter (discharge,
transfer). For each clinical condition, we annotated
whether a temporal expression modified it and, if
so, the category of temporal expression. We used
six major categories from Zhou et al. (2006) in-
cluding: Date and Time, Relative Date and Time,
Durations, Key Events, Fuzzy Time, and No Tem-
poral Expression. These categories also have
types. For instance, Relative Date and Time has a
type Yesterday, Today or Tomorrow. For the con-
dition in the sentence “The patient had a stroke in
May 2006”, the temporal expression category is
Date and Time with type Date. Statements without
a temporal expression were annotated No Tempor-
al Expression with type N/A.
(2) Tense and Aspect: Tense and aspect define
how a verb is situated and related to a particular
time. We used TimeML Specification 1.2.1 for
standardization of tense and aspect where exam-
ples of tense include Past or Present and aspect
may be Perfective, Progressive, Both or None as
found in Saur´ı, et al. (2006). We annotated the
verb that scoped a condition and annotated its tense
and aspect. The primary verb may be a predicate
adjective integral to interpretation of the condition
(Left ventricle is enlarged), a verb preceding the
condition (has hypertension), or a verb following a
condition (Chest pain has resolved). In “her chest
pain has resolved,” we would mark “has resolved”
with tense Present and aspect Perfective. State-
ments without verbs (e.g., No murmurs) would be
annotated Null for both.
(3) Trigger Terms: We annotated lexical cues
that provide temporal information about a condi-
tion. For example, in the statement, “Patient has
</listItem>

past history of diabetes,” we would annotate “his-
tory” as Trigger Term: Yes and would note the ex-
act trigger term.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998871875">
(4) Sections: Sections are “clinically meaning-
ful segments which act independently of the
unique narrative” for a patient (Denny et al. 2008).
Examples of report sections include Review of Sys-
tems (Emergency Department), Findings (Opera-
tive Gastrointestinal and Radiology) and
Discharge Diagnosis (Emergency Department and
Discharge Summary).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999525888888889">
We extended Denny’s section schema with ex-
plicit, report-specific section headers not included
in the original terminology. Similar to Denny, we
assigned implied sections in which there was an
obvious change of topic and paragraph marker. For
instance, if the sentence “the patient is allergic to
penicillin” followed the Social History section, we
annotated the section as Allergies, even if there
was not a section heading for allergies.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975384615384">
We randomly selected seven reports from each of
six genres of clinical reports dictated at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Medical Center during 2007
These included Discharge Summaries, Surgical
Pathology, Radiology, Echocardiograms, Opera-
tive Gastrointestinal, and Emergency Department
reports. The dataset ultimately contained 42 clini-
cal reports and 854 conditions. Figure 1 show our
annotation process, which was completed in
GATE, an open-source framework for building
NLP systems (http://gate.ac.uk/). A physician
board-certified in internal medicine and infectious
diseases annotated all clinical conditions in the set
and annotated each condition as either historical or
recent. He used a general guideline for annotating
a condition as historical if the condition began
more than 14 days before the current encounter and
as recent if it began or occurred within 14 days or
during the current visit. However, the physician
was not bound to this definition and ultimately
used his own judgment to determine whether a
condition was historical.
Provided with pre-annotated clinical conditions
and blinded to the historical category, three of the
authors annotated the features iteratively in groups
of six (one of each report type) using guidelines we

developed for the first two types of temporal fea-
tures (temporal expressions and trigger terms.)
Between iterations, we resolved disagreements
through discussion and updated our guidelines.
Cohen’s kappa for temporal expressions and trig-
ger terms by the final iteration was at 0.66 and 0.69
respectively. Finally, one author annotated sec-
tions, verb tense, and aspect. Cases in which as-
signing the appropriate feature value was unclear
were resolved after consultation with one other
author-annotator.

<bodyText confidence="0.999986105263158">
We represented each condition as a vector with
temporal features and their manually-assigned val-
ues as input features for predicting the binary out-
come value of historical or recent. We trained three
rule learning algorithms to classify each condition
as historical or recent: J48 Decision Tree, Ripper,
and Rule Learner (RL) (Witten and Frank, 2005;
Clearwater and Provost, 1990). Rule learners per-
form well at classification tasks and provide expli-
cit rules that can be viewed, understood, and
potentially implemented in existing rule-based ap-
plications. We used Weka 3.5.8, an openly-
available machine learning application for predic-
tion modeling, to implement the Decision Tree
(J48) and Ripper (JRip) algorithms, and we applied
an in house version of RL retrieved from
www.dbmi.pitt.edu\probe. For all rule learners, we
used the default settings and ran ten-fold cross-
validation. The J48 algorithm produces mutually
exclusive rules for predicting the outcome value.
Thus, two rules cannot cover or apply to any one
case. In contrast, both JRip and RL generate non-
mutually-exclusive rules for predicting the out-
come value. Although J48 and JRip are sensitive to
bias in outcome values, RL accounts for skewed
distribution of the data.
We also applied ConText to the test cases to
classify them as historical or recent. ConText looks
for trigger terms and a limited set of temporal ex-
pressions within a sentence. Clinical conditions
within the scope of the trigger terms are assigned
the value indicated by the trigger terms (e.g., his-
torical for the term history). Scope extends from
the trigger term to the end of the sentence or until
the presence of a termination term, such as pre-
senting. For instance, in the sentence “History of
CHF, presenting with chest pain,” CHF would be
annotated as historical.

5 Evaluation

<bodyText confidence="0.99401405">
To characterize the different reports types, we es-
tablished the overall prevalence and proportion of
conditions annotated as historical for each clinical
report genre. We assessed the prevalence of each
feature (temporal expressions, trigger terms, tense
and aspect, and sections) by report genre to deter-
mine the level of similarity or difference between
genres. To determine which features values are
predictive of whether a condition is historical or
recent, we observed common rules found by more
than one rule learning algorithm. Amongst com-
mon rules, we identified new rules that could im-
prove the ConText algorithm.
We also measured predictive performance with
95% confidence intervals of the rule learners and
ConText by calculating overall accuracy, as well as
recall and precision for historical classifications
and recall and precision for recent classifications.

6.2 Common Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993252">
Rule learners generated a variety of rules. The J48
Decision Tree algorithm learned 27 rules, six for
predicting conditions as historical and the remain-
ing for classifying the condition as recent. The
rules predominantly incorporated the trigger term
and verb tense and aspect feature values. JRip
learned nine rules, eight for classifying the histori-
cal temporal category and one ‘otherwise’ rule for
the majority class. The JRip rules most heavily
incorporated the section feature. The RL algorithm
found 79 rules, 18 of which predict the historical
category. Figure 2 illustrates historical rules
learned by each rule learner. JRip and RL pre-
dicted the following sections alone can be used to
predict a condition as historical: Past Medical His-
tory, Allergies and Social History. Both J48 and
RL learned that trigger terms like previous, known
and history predict historical. There was only one
common, simple rule for the historical category
found amongst all three learners: the trigger term
no change predicts the historical category. All al-
gorithms learned a number of rules that include
two features values; however, none of the com-
pound rules were common amongst all three algo-
rithms.

Table 4 shows predictive performance for each
rule learner and for ConText. The RL algorithm
outperformed all other algorithms in almost all
evaluation measures. The RL scores were com-
puted based on classifying the 42 cases (eight his-
torical) for which the algorithm did not make a
prediction as recent. ConText and J48, which ex-
clusively relied on trigger terms, had lower recall
for the historical category.
All of the rule learners out-performed ConText.
JRip and RL showed substantially higher recall for
assigning the historical category, which is the most
important measure in a comparison with ConText,
because ConText assigns the default value of re-
cent unless there is textual evidence to indicate a
historical classification. Although the majority
class baseline shows high accuracy due to high
prevalence of the recent category, all other classifi-
ers show even higher accuracy, achieving fairly
high recall and precision for the historical cases
while maintaining high performance on the recent
category.

7 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927627118644">
Our study provides a descriptive investigation of
temporal features found in clinical text. Our first
objective was to characterize the temporal similari-
ties and differences amongst report types. We
found that the majority of conditions in all report
genres were recent conditions, indicating that a
majority class classifier would produce an accura-
cy of about 87% over our data set. According to
the distributions of temporal category by report
genre (Table 2), Echocardiograms exclusively de-
scribe recent conditions. Operative Gastrointestinal
and Radiology reports contain similar proportions
of historical conditions (9% and 6%). Echocardio-
grams appear to be most similar to Radiology re-
ports and Operative Gastrointestinal reports, which
may be supported by the fact that these reports are
used to document findings from tests conducted
during the current visit. Emergency Department
reports and Discharge Summaries contain similar
proportions of historical conditions (17% and 19%
respectively), which might be explained by the fact
that both reports describe a patient’s temporal pro-
gression throughout the stay in the Emergency De-
partment or the hospital.
Surgical Pathology reports may be the most
temporally distinct report in our study, showing the
highest proportion of historical conditions. This
may seem counter-intuitive given that Surgical
Pathology reports also facilitate the reporting of
findings described from a recent physical speci-
men. However, we had a small sample size (28
conditions in seven reports), and most of the his-
torical conditions were described in a single ad-
dendum report. Removing this report decreased the
prevalence of historical conditions to 23% (3/13).
Discharge Summaries and Emergency Depart-
ment reports displayed more variety in the ob-
served types of temporal expressions (9 to 14
subtypes) and trigger terms (10 to 12 terms) than
other report genres. This is not surprising consider-
ing the range of events described in these reports.
Other reports tend to have between zero and three
subtypes of temporal expressions and zero and
seven different trigger terms. In all report types,
temporal expressions were mainly subtype past,
and the most frequent trigger term was history.
Our second objective was to identify which fea-
tures predict whether a condition is historical or
recent. Due to high prevalence of the recent cate-
gory, we were especially interested in discovering
temporal features that predict whether a condition
is historical. With one exception (date greater than
four weeks prior to the current visit), temporal ex-
pression features always occurred in compound
rules in which the temporal expression value had to
co-occur with another feature value. For instance,
any temporal expression in the category key event
had to also occur in the secondary diagnosis sec-
tion to classify the condition as historical. For ex-
</bodyText>

ample, in “SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Status
post Coronary artery bypass graft with complica-
tion of mediastinitis” the key event is the coronary
artery bypass graft, the section is secondary diag-
nosis, and the correct classification is historical.
Similarly, verb tense and aspect were only use-
ful in conjunction with other feature values. One
rule predicted a condition as historical if the condi-
tion was modified by the trigger term history and
fell within the scope of a present tense verb with
no aspect. An example of this is “The patient is a
50 year old male with history of hypertension.”
Intuitively, one would think that a past tense verb
would always predict historical; however, we
found the presence of a past tense verb with no
aspect was a feature only when the condition was
in the Patient History section. Sometimes the ab-
sence of a verb in conjunction with another feature
value predicted a condition as historical. For ex-
ample, in the sentences “PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: History of COPD. Also diabetes...”
also functioned as a trigger term that extended the
scope of a previous trigger term, history, in the
antecedent sentence.
A few historical trigger terms were discovered
as simple rules by the rule learners: no change,
previous, known, status post, and history. A few
rules incorporated both a trigger term and a partic-
ular section header value. One rule predicted his-
torical if the trigger term was status post and the
condition occurred in the History of Present Illness
section. This rule would classify the condition
CABG as historical in “HISTORY OF PRESENT
ILLNESS: The patient is...status post CABG.”
One important detail to note is that a number of the
temporal expressions categorized as Fuzzy Time
also act as trigger terms, such as history and status
post—both of which were learned by J48. A histor-
ical trigger term did not always predict the catego-
ry historical. In the sentence “No focal sensory or
motor deficits on history,” history may suggest that
the condition was not previously documented, but
was interpreted as not presently identified during
the current physical exam.
Finally, sections appeared in the majority of
JRip and RL historical rules: 4/8 simple rules and
13/18 compound rules. A few sections were con-
sistently classified as historical: Past Medical His-
tory, Allergies, and Social History. One important
point to address is that these sections were manual-
ly annotated.
Our results revealed a few unexpected observa-
tions. We found at least two trigger terms indicated
in the J48 rules, also and status post, which did not
have the same predictive ability across report ge-
nres. For instance, in the statement “TRANSFER
DIAGNOSIS: status post coiling for left posterior
internal carotid artery aneurysm,” status post indi-
cates the reason for the transfer as an inpatient
from the Emergency Department and the condition
is recent. In contrast, status post in a Surgical Pa-
thology report was interpreted to mean historical
(e.g., PATIENT HISTORY: Status post double
lung transplant for COPD.) In these instances,
document knowledge of the meaning of the section
may be useful to resolve these cases.
One other unexpected finding was that the trig-
ger term chronic was predictive of recent rather
than historical. This may seem counterintuitive;
however, in the statement “We are treating this as
chronic musculoskeletal pain with oxycodone”, the
condition is being referenced in the context of the
reason for the current visit. Contextual information
surrounding the condition, in this case treating or
administering medication for the condition, may
help discriminate several of these cases.
Our third objective was to assess ConText in re-
lation to the rules learned from manually annotated
temporal features. J48 and ConText emphasized
the use of trigger terms as predictors of whether a
condition was historical or recent and performed
with roughly the same overall accuracy. JRip and
RL learned rules that incorporated other feature
values including sections and temporal expres-
sions, resulting in a 12% increase in historical re-
call over ConText and a 31% increase in historical
recall over J48.
Many of the rules we learned can be easily ex-
tracted and incorporated into ConText (e.g., trigger
terms previous and no change). The ConText algo-
rithm largely relies on the use of trigger terms like
history and one section header, Past Medical His-
tory. By incorporating additional section headers
that may strongly predict historical, ConText could
potentially predict a condition as historical when a
trigger term is absent and the header title is the
only predictor as in the case of “ALLERGIES:
peanut allergy”. Although these sections header
may only be applied to Emergency Department
and Discharge Summaries, trigger terms and tem-
poral expressions may be generalizable across ge-
nre of reports. Some rules do not lend themselves

to ConText’s trigger-term-based approach, particu-
larly those that require sophisticated representation
and reasoning. For example, ConText only reasons
some simple durations like several day history.
ConText cannot compute dates from the current
visit to reason that a condition occurred in the past
(e.g., stroke in March 2000). The algorithm per-
formance would gain from such a function; how-
ever, such a task would greatly add to its
complexity.

8 Limitations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950333333333">
The small sample size of reports and few condi-
tions found in three report genres (Operative Ga-
strointestinal, Radiology, and Surgical Pathology)
is a limitation in this study. Also, annotation of
conditions, temporal category, sections, verb tense
and aspect were conducted by a single author,
which may have introduced bias to the study. Most
studies on temporality in text focus on the temporal
features themselves. For instance, the prevalence
of temporal expressions reported by Zhou et al.
(2006) include all temporal expressions found
throughout a discharge summary, whereas we an-
notated only those expressions that modified the
condition. This difference makes comparing our
results to other published literature challenging.

<bodyText confidence="0.999987842105263">
Although our results are preliminary, we be-
lieve our study has provided a few new insights
that may help improve the state of the art for his-
torical categorization of a condition. The next step
to building on this work includes automatically
extracting the predictive features identified by the
rule learners. Some features may be easier to ex-
tract than others. Since sections appear to be strong
indicators for historical categorization we may start
by implementing the SecTag tagger. Often a sec-
tion header does not exist between text describing
the past medical history and a description of the
current problem, so relying merely on the section
heading is not sufficient. The SecTag tagger identi-
fies both implicit and explicit sections and may
prove useful for this task. To our knowledge, Sec-
Tag was only tested on Emergency Department
reports, so adapting it to other report genres will be
necessary. Both JRip and RL produced high per-
formance, suggesting a broader set of features may
improve historical classification; however, because
these features do not result in perfect performance,
there are surely other features necessary for im-
proving historical classification. For instance, hu-
mans use medical knowledge about conditions that
are inherently chronic or usually experienced over
the course of a patient’s life (i.e., HIV, social ha-
bits like smoking, allergies etc). Moreover, physi-
cians are able to integrate knowledge about chronic
conditions with understanding of the patient’s rea-
son for visit to determine whether a chronic condi-
tion is also a recent problem. An application that
imitated experts would need to integrate this type
of information. We also need to explore adding
features captured at the discourse level, such as
nominal and temporal coreference. We have begun
work in these areas and are optimistic that they
will improve historical categorization.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995825">
Although most conditions in six clinical report ge-
nres are recent problems, identifying those that are
historical is important in understanding a patient’s
clinical state. A simple algorithm that relies on lex-
ical cues and simple temporal expressions can
classify the majority of historical conditions, but
our results indicate that the ability to reason with
temporal expressions, to recognize tense and as-
pect, and to place conditions in the context of their
report sections will improve historical classifica-
tion. We will continue to explore other features to
predict historical categorization.

One important problem in natural language processing is extracting the appropriate temporal granularity for a given task. Many solutions exist for extracting temporal information, and each is designed to address questions of various degrees of temporal granularity, including determining whether a condition is historical or recent, identifying explicit temporal expressions, and identifying temporal relations among events in text. (Chapman et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008; Irvine et al., 2008; Verhagen and Pustejovsky, 2008; Bramsen et al., 2006). We previously extended the NegEx algorithm in ConText, a simple algorithm that relies on lexical cues to determine whether a condition is historical or recent (Chapman et al., 2007). However, ConText performs with moderate recall (76%) and precision (75%) across different report types implying that trigger terms and simple temporal expressions are not sufficient for the task of identifying historical conditions. In order to extend work in identifying historical conditions, we conducted a detailed a</context>

MediClass is a knowledge-based system that classifies the content of an encounter using both free-text and encoded information from electronic medical records (Hazelhurst et al., 2005). For example, MediClass classifies smoking cessation care delivery events by identifying the status of a smoker as continued, former or history using words like continues. ConText, an extension of the NegEx algorithm, temporally classifies conditions as historical, recent, or hypothetical using lexical cues such as history, new, and if, respectively (Chapman et al., 2007). Drawing from these applications, we used state and temporal trigger terms like active, unchanged, and history to capture coarse, temporal information about a condition. Temporal information may also be implied in the document structure, particularly with regards to the section in which the condition appears. SecTag marks explicit and implicit sections found throughout patient H&amp;P notes (Denny et al., 2008). We adopted some section headers from the SecTag terminology to annotate sections found in reports. Our long-term goal is to build a robust temporal classifier for information found in cli</context>

For example, in the statement, “Patient has past history of diabetes,” we would annotate “history” as Trigger Term: Yes and would note the exact trigger term. (4) Sections: Sections are “clinically meaningful segments which act independently of the unique narrative” for a patient (Denny et al. 2008). Examples of report sections include Review of Systems (Emergency Department), Findings (Operative Gastrointestinal and Radiology) and Discharge Diagnosis (Emergency Department and Discharge Summary). We extended Denny’s section schema with explicit, report-specific section headers not included in the original terminology.

TimeML supports the annotation of events defined as “situations that happen or occur” and temporal expressions such as dates and durations in order to answer temporal questions about these events and other entities in news text (Saur´ı, et al., 2006). One notable feature of the TimeML schema is its ability to capture verb tense such as past or present and verb aspect such as perfective or progressing. We annotated verb tense and aspect in medical text according to the TimeML standard. Within the medical domain, Zhou et al. (2006) developed an annotation schema used to identify temporal expressions and clinical events. They measured the prevalence of explicit temporal expressions and key medical events like admission or transfer found in discharge summaries. We used the Zhou categorization scheme to explore temporal expressions and clinical events across genres of reports. A few NLP systems rely on lexical cues to address time. MediClass is a knowledge-based system that classifies the content of an encounter using both free-text and encoded information from electronic medical records (Hazelhurst et al., 2005).

Next, we describe the temporal features we assessed for identification of historical signs, symptoms, or diseases, including temporal expressions, lexical cues, verb tense and aspect, and sections. (1) Temporal Expressions: Temporal expressions are time operators like dates (May 5th 2005) and durations (for past two days), as well as clinical processes related to the encounter (discharge, transfer). For each clinical condition, we annotated whether a temporal expression modified it and, if so, the category of temporal expression. We used six major categories from Zhou et al. (2006) including: Date and Time, Relative Date and Time, Durations, Key Events, Fuzzy Time, and No Temporal Expression. These categories also have types. For instance, Relative Date and Time has a type Yesterday, Today or Tomorrow. For the condition in the sentence “The patient had a stroke in May 2006”, the temporal expression category is Date and Time with type Date. Statements without a temporal expression were annotated No Temporal Expression with type N/A. (2) Tense and Aspect: Tense and aspect define how a verb is situated and related to a particular time.

Also, annotation of conditions, temporal category, sections, verb tense and aspect were conducted by a single author, which may have introduced bias to the study. Most studies on temporality in text focus on the temporal features themselves. For instance, the prevalence of temporal expressions reported by Zhou et al. (2006) include all temporal expressions found throughout a discharge summary, whereas we annotated only those expressions that modified the condition. This difference makes comparing our results to other published literature challenging. 9 Future Work Although our results are preliminary, we believe our study has provided a few new insights that may help improve the state of the art for historical categorization of a condition. The next step to building on this work includes automatically extracting the predictive features identified by the rule learners. Some features may be easier to extract than </context>

Our three main objectives were: (1) characterize the temporal similarity and differences found in different genres of clinical text; (2) determine which features successfully predict whether a condition is historical, and (3) compare ConText to machine learning classifiers that account for this broader set of temporal features. 2 Temporality in Clinical Text For several decades, researchers have been studying temporality in clinical records (Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007).

One important problem in natural language processing is extracting the appropriate temporal granularity for a given task. Many solutions exist for extracting temporal information, and each is designed to address questions of various degrees of temporal granularity, including determining whether a condition is historical or recent, identifying explicit temporal expressions, and identifying temporal relations among events in text. (Chapman et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008; Irvine et al., 2008; Verhagen and Pustejovsky, 2008; Bramsen et al., 2006). We previously extended the NegEx algorithm in ConText, a simple algorithm that relies on lexical cues to determine whether a condition is historical or recent (Chapman et al., 2007). However, ConText performs with moderate recall (76%) and precision (75%) across different report types implying that trigger terms and simple temporal expressions are not sufficient for the task of identifying historical conditions. In order to extend work in identifying historical conditions, we conducted a detailed annotation study of </context>

One system that emerged from the AQUAINT workshops for temporal modeling of newspaper articles is TARSQI. TARSQI processes events annotated in text by anchoring and ordering them with respect to nearby temporal expressions (Verhagen and Pustejovsky, 2008). A few recent applications, such as TimeText and TN-TIES (Zhou et al., 2008; Irvine et al., 2008), identify medically relevant events from clinical texts and use temporal expressions to order the events. One method attempts to order temporal segments of clinical narratives (Bramsen et al., 2006). One key difference between these previous efforts and our work is that these systems identify all temporal expressions from the text and attempt to order all events. In contrast, our goal is to determine whether a clinical condition is historical or recent, so we focus only on temporal information related to the signs, symptoms, and diseases described in the text.
