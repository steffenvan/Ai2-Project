Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998384375">
I will describe my collaborators&apos; and my
own effort to compile large models of
molecular pathways in complex human
disorders.
The talk will address a number of interre-
lated questions:
How to extract facts from texts at a large
scale?
How to assess the quality of the extracted
facts?
How to identify sets of conflicting or un-
reliable facts and to generate an internally
consistent model?
How to use the resulting pathway model
for automated generation of biological
hypotheses?
