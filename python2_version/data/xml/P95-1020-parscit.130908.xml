Drawing appropriate defeasible infe-
rences has been proven to be one of
the most pervasive puzzles of natu-
ral language processing and a recur-
rent problem in pragmatics. This pa-
per provides a theoretical framework,
called stratified logic, that can ac-
commodate defeasible pragmatic infe-
rences. The framework yields an al-
gorithm that computes the conversa-
tional, conventional, scalar, clausal,
and normal state implicatures; and
the presuppositions that are associa-
ted with utterances. The algorithm
applies equally to simple and complex
utterances and sequences of utteran-
ces.

1 Pragmatics and Defeasibility
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.907072892857143">
It is widely acknowledged that a full account of na-
tural language utterances cannot be given in terms
of only syntactic or semantic phenomena. For ex-
ample, Hirschberg (1985) has shown that in order to
understand a scalar implicature, one must analyze
the conversants&apos; beliefs and intentions. To recognize
normal state implicatures one must consider mutual
beliefs and plans (Green, 1990). To understand con-
versational implicatures associated with indirect re-
plies one must consider discourse expectations, dis-
course plans, and discourse relations (Green, 1992;
Green and Carberry, 1994). Some presuppositions
are inferrable when certain lexical constructs (fac-
tives, aspectuals, etc) or syntactic constructs (cleft
and pseudo-cleft sentences) are used. Despite all the
complexities that individualize the recognition stage
for each of these inferences, all of them can be de-
feated by context, by knowledge, beliefs, or plans of
the agents that constitute part of the context, or by
other pragmatic rules.
Defeasibility is a notion that is tricky to deal with,
and scholars in logics and pragmatics have learned
to circumvent it or live with it. The first observers of
the phenomenon preferred to keep defeasibility out-
side the mathematical world. For Frege (1892), Rus-
sell (1905), and Quine (1949) &amp;quot;everything exists&amp;quot;;
therefore, in their logical systems, it is impossible
to formalize the cancellation of the presupposition
that definite referents exist (Hirst, 1991; Marcu and
Hirst, 1994). We can taxonomize previous approa-
ches to defea3ible pragmatic inferences into three ca-
tegories (we omit here work on defeasibility related
to linguistic phenomena such as discourse, anaphora,
or speech acts).
1. Most linguistic approaches account for the de-
feasibility of pragmatic inferences by analyzing them
in a context that consists of all or some of the pre-
vious utterances, including the current one. Con-
text (Karttunen, 1974; Kay, 1992), procedural ru-
les (Gazdar, 1979; Karttunen and Peters, 1979),
lexical and syntactic structure (Weischedel, 1979),
intentions (Hirschberg, 1985), or anaphoric cons-
traints (Sandt, 1992; Zeevat, 1992) decide what pre-
suppositions or implicatures are projected as prag-
matic inferences for the utterance that is analyzed.
The problem with these approaches is that they as-
sign a dual life to pragmatic inferences: in the initial
stage, as members of a simple or complex utterance,
they are defeasible. However, after that utterance
is analyzed, there is no possibility left of cancelling
that inference. But it is natural to have implicatures
and presuppositions that are inferred and cancelled
as a sequence of utterances proceeds: research in
conversation repairs (Hirst et al., 1994) abounds in
such examples. We address this issue in more detail
in section 3.3.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992130636363636">
2. One way of accounting for cancellations that
occur later in the analyzed text is simply to extend
the boundaries within which pragmatic inferences
are evaluated, i.e., to look ahead a few utterances.
Green (1992) assumes that implicatures are connec-
ted to discourse entities and not to utterances, but
her approach still does not allow cancellations across
discourse units.
3. Another way of allowing pragmatic inferences
to be cancelled is to assign them the status of de-
feasible information. Mercer (1987) formalizes pre-

suppositions in a logical framework that handles de-
faults (Reiter, 1980), but this approach is not tracta-
ble and it treats natural disjunction as an exclusive-
or and implication as logical equivalence.
Computational approaches fail to account for the
cancellation of pragmatic inferences: once presuppo-
sitions (Weischedel, 1979) or implicatures (Hirsch-
berg, 1985; Green, 1992) are generated, they can
never be cancelled. We are not aware of any forma-
lism or computational approach that offers a unified
explanation for the cancellability of pragmatic infe-
rences in general, and of no approach that handles
cancellations that occur in sequences of utterances.
It is our aim to provide such an approach here. In
doing this, we assume the existence, for each type
of pragmatic inference, of a set of necessary conditi-
ons that must be true in order for that inference to
be triggered. Once such a set of conditions is met,
the corresponding inference is drawn, but it is as-
signed a defeasible status. It is the role of context
and knowledge of the conversants to &amp;quot;decide&amp;quot; whe-
ther that inference will survive or not as a pragma-
tic inference of the structure. We put no boundaries
upon the time when such a cancellation can occur,
and we offer a unified explanation for pragmatic in-
ferences that are inferable when simple utterances,
complex utterances, or sequences of utterances are
considered.
We propose a new formalism, called &amp;quot;stratified
logic&amp;quot;, that correctly handles the pragmatic infe-
rences, and we start by giving a very brief intro-
duction to the main ideas that underlie it. We give
the main steps of the algorithm that is defined on
the backbone of stratified logic. We then show how
different classes of pragmatic inferences can be cap-
tured using this formalism, and how our algorithm
computes the expected results for a representative
class of pragmatic inferences. The results we report
here are obtained using an implementation written
in Common Lisp that uses Screamer (Siskind and
McAllester, 1993), a macro package that provides
nondeterministic constructs.

We can offer here only a brief overview of stratified
logic. The reader is referred to Marcu (1994) for a
comprehensive study. Stratified logic supports one
type of indefeasible information and two types of
defeasible information, namely, infelicitously defea-
sible and felicitously defeasible. The notion of infe-
licitously defeasible information is meant to capture
inferences that are anomalous to cancel, as in:
(1) * John regrets that Mary came to the party
but she did not come.
The notion of felicitously defeasible information is
meant to capture the inferences that can be cancel-
led without any abnormality, as in:

(2) John does not regret that Mary came to the
party because she did not come.
The lattice in figure 1 underlies the semantics of
stratified logic. The lattice depicts the three levels of
strength that seem to account for the inferences that
pertain to natural language semantics and pragma-
tics: indefeasible information belongs to the u layer,
infelicitously defeasible information belongs to the
i layer, and felicitously defeasible information be-
longs to the d layer. Each layer is partitioned accor-
ding to. its polarity in truth, T&amp;quot;, Ti, Ti&apos;, and falsity,
_Lu, Is, Id. The lattice shows a partial order that is
defined over the different levels of truth. For exam-
ple, something that is indefeasibly false, is stron-
ger (in a sense to be defined below) than. something
that is infelicitously defeasibly true, P, or felici-
tously defensibly false, Id. Formally, we say that the
u level is stronger than the i level, which is stronger
than the d level: u &lt; i&lt;d. At the syntactic level, we
allow atomic formulas to be labelled according to the
same underlying lattice. Compound formulas are
obtained in the usual way. This will give us formu-
las such as regret es (J ohn, come(M ary, party))
come&apos; (M ary, party)), or (V x)(--,bachelor• (x) —+
(male d (x) A adultd (x))). The satisfaction relation
is split according to the three levels of truth into
u-satisfaction, i-satisfaction, and d-satisfaction:

that t = di E V and assume that SG maps n-ary
predicates p to relations RCDx x D. For any
atomic formula px(ti,t2,...,tn), and any stratified
valuation a, where x E {u, i, d} and ti are terms, the
x-satisfiability relations are defined as follows:

Definition 2.1 extends in a natural way to negated
and compound formulas. Having a satisfaction de-
finition associated with each level of strength provi-
des a high degree of flexibility. The same theory can
be interpreted from a perspective that allows more
freedom (u-satisfaction), or from a perspective that
is tighter and that signals when some defeasible in-
formation has been cancelled (i- and d-satisfaction).
Possible interpretations of a given set of utteran-
ces with respect to a knowledge base are computed
using an extension of the semantic tableau method.
This extension has been proved to be both sound
and complete (Marcu, 1994). A partial ordering,
&lt;, determines the set of optimistic interpretations
for a theory. An interpretation mo is preferred to,
or is more optimistic than, an interpretation m1
(mo &lt; mi) if it contains more information and that
information can be more easily updated in the fu-
ture. That means that if an interpretation mo makes
an utterance true by assigning to a relation R a
defeasible status, while another interpretation m1
makes the same utterance true by assigning the same
relation R a stronger status, mo will be the preferred
or optimistic one, because it is as informative as m1
and it allows more options in the future (R can be
defeated).
Pragmatic inferences are triggered by utterances.
To differentiate between them and semantic infe-
rences, we introduce a new quantifier, Yu&apos;, whose
semantics is defined such that a pragmatic inference
of the form (Vutii)(ai(il) a2(ti)) is instantiated
only for those objects r from the universe of dis-
course that pertain to an utterance having the form
cli(i). Hence, only if the antecedent of a pragma-
tic rule has been uttered can that rule be applied.
A meta-logical construct uttered applies to the logi-
cal translation of utterances. This theory yields the
following definition:

of stratified first-order logic that appropriately for-

cessary conditions that trigger pragmatic inferences.
The semantics of lexical terms is formalized using
the quantifier V, while the necessary conditions that
pertain to pragmatic inferences are captured using
\tut Let uttered(u) be the logical translation of a
given utterance or set of utterances. We say that ut-
terance u pragmatically implicates p if and only if pd
or pi is derived using pragmatic inferences in at least
one optimistic model of the theory 0 U uttered(u),
and if p is not cancelled by any stronger informa-
tion (-pu ,-,p&apos;,-13d) in any optimistic model schema
of the theory. Symmetrically, one can define what
a negative pragmatic inference is. In both cases,
0 U uttered(u) is u-consistent.

2.2 The algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973625">
Our algorithm, described in detail by Marcu (1994),
takes as input a set of first-order stratified formu-
las 0 that represents an adequate knowledge base
that expresses semantic knowledge and the necessary
conditions for triggering pragmatic inferences, and
the translation of an utterance or set of utterances
uttered(u). The algorithm builds the set of all possi-
ble interpretations for a given utterance, using a ge-
neralization of the semantic tableau technique. The
model-ordering relation filters the optimistic inter-
pretations. Among them, the defeasible inferences
that have been triggered on pragmatic grounds are
checked to see whether or not they are cancelled in
any optimistic interpretation. Those that are not
cancelled are labelled as pragmatic inferences for the
given utterance or set of utterances.

The Achilles heel for most theories of presupposition
has been their vulnerability to the projection pro-
blem. Our solution for the projection problem does
not differ from a solution for individual utterances.
Consider the following utterances and some of their
associated presuppositions (11) (the symbol i&gt; pre-
cedes an inference drawn on pragmatic grounds):

Chris is not a bachelor presupposes that Chris is a
male adult; Chris regrets that Mary came to the party

<bodyText confidence="0.998163866666667">
presupposes that Mary came to the party. There is
no contradiction between these two presuppositions,
so one would expect a conversant to infer both of
them if she hears an utterance such as (9). Howe-
ver, when one examines utterance (10), one observes
immediately that there is a contradiction between
the presuppositions carried by the individual com-
ponents. Being a bachelor presupposes that Chris
is a male, while being a spinster presupposes that
Chris is a female. Normally, we would expect a con-
versant to notice this contradiction and to drop each
of these elementary presuppositions when she inter-
prets (10).

and the lexical pragmatics for bachelor and regret.

tion and cancellation of pragmatic inferences along
sequences of utterances (McRoy and Hirst, 1993).
Suppose, for example, that Jane has two friends —
John Smith and John Pevler — and that her room-
mate Mary has met only John Smith, a married fel-
low. Assume now that Jane has a conversation with
Mary in which Jane mentions only the name John
because she is not aware that Mary does not know
about the other John, who is a five-year-old boy. In
this context, it is natural for Mary to become confu-
sed and to come to wrong conclusions. For example,
Mary may reply that John is not a bachelor. Alt-
hough this is true for both Johns, it is more appro-
priate for the married fellow than for the five-year-
old boy. Mary knows that John Smith is a married
male, so the utterance makes sense for her. At this
point Jane realizes that Mary misunderstands her:
all the time Jane was talking about John Pevler, the
five-year-old boy. The utterances in (13) constitute
a possible answer that Jane may give to Mary in
order to clarify the problem.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8196475">
(13) a. No, John is not a bachelor.
b. I regret that you have misunderstood me.
c. He is only five years old.
The first utterance in the sequence presuppo-
ses (14).
(14) C. John is a male adult.
Utterance (13)b warns Mary that is very likely she
misunderstood a previous utterance (15). The war-
ning is conveyed by implicature.
(15) c. The hearer misunderstood the speaker.

<bodyText confidence="0.958324583333333">
At this point, the hearer, Mary, starts to believe
that one of her previous utterances has been elabo-
rated on a false assumption, but she does not know
which one. The third utterance (13)c comes to cla-
rify the issue. It explicitly expresses that John is not
an adult. Therefore, it cancels the early presupposi-
tion (14):
(16) V. John is an adult.
Note that there is a gap of one statement between
the generation and the cancellation of this presup-
position. The behavior described is mirrored both
by our theory and our program.

The same methodology can be applied to mode-
ling conversational implicatures in indirect replies
(Green, 1992). Green&apos;s algorithm makes use of dis-
course expectations, discourse plans, and discourse
relations. The following dialog is considered (Green,

Answer (17) conveys a &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, but a reply consisting
only of (17)a would implicate a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;. As Green no-
tices, in previous models of implicatures (Gazdar,
1979; Hirschberg, 1985), processing (17)a will block
the implicature generated by (17)c. Green solves the
problem by extending the boundaries of the analysis
to discourse units. Our approach does not exhibit
these constraints. As in the previous example, the
one dealing with a sequence of utterances, we obtain
a different interpretation after each step. When the
question is asked, there is no conversational impli-
cature. Answer (17)a makes the necessary conditi-
ons for implicating &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; true, and the implication is
computed. Answer (17)b reinforces a previous con-
dition. Answer (17)c makes the preconditions for
implicating a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; false, and the preconditions for
implicating a &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; true. Therefore, the implicature
at the end of the dialogue is that the conversant who
answered went shopping.

Unlike most research in pragmatics that focuses on
certain types of presuppositions or implicatures, we
provide a global framework in which one can ex-
press all these types of pragmatic inferences. Each
pragmatic inference is associated with a set of ne-
cessary conditions that may trigger that inference.
When such a set of conditions is met, that infe-
rence is drawn, but it is assigned a defeasible status.
An extended definition of satisfaction and a notion
of &amp;quot;optimism&amp;quot; with respect to different interpreta-
tions yield the preferred interpretations for an ut-
terance or sequences of utterances. These interpre-
tations contain the pragmatic inferences that have
not been cancelled by context or conversant&apos;s know-
ledge, plans, or intentions. The formalism yields an
algorithm that has been implemented in Common
Lisp with Screamer. This algorithm computes uni-
formly pragmatic inferences that are associated with
simple and complex utterances and sequences of ut-
terances, and allows cancellations of pragmatic infe-
rences to occur at any time in the discourse.

<abstract confidence="0.989320834285714">Drawing appropriate defeasible inferences has been proven to be one of the most pervasive puzzles of natural language processing and a recurrent problem in pragmatics. This paper provides a theoretical framework, stratified can accommodate defeasible pragmatic inferences. The framework yields an algorithm that computes the conversational, conventional, scalar, clausal, and normal state implicatures; and the presuppositions that are associated with utterances. The algorithm applies equally to simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances. 1 Pragmatics and Defeasibility It is widely acknowledged that a full account of natural language utterances cannot be given in terms of only syntactic or semantic phenomena. For example, Hirschberg (1985) has shown that in order to understand a scalar implicature, one must analyze the conversants&apos; beliefs and intentions. To recognize normal state implicatures one must consider mutual beliefs and plans (Green, 1990). To understand conversational implicatures associated with indirect replies one must consider discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations (Green, 1992; Green and Carberry, 1994). Some presuppositions are inferrable when certain lexical constructs (factives, aspectuals, etc) or syntactic constructs (cleft and pseudo-cleft sentences) are used. Despite all the complexities that individualize the recognition stage each of these inferences, them can be defeated by context, by knowledge, beliefs, or plans of the agents that constitute part of the context, or by other pragmatic rules. is notion that is tricky to deal with, and scholars in logics and pragmatics have learned to circumvent it or live with it. The first observers of the phenomenon preferred to keep defeasibility outside the mathematical world. For Frege (1892), Russell (1905), and Quine (1949) &amp;quot;everything exists&amp;quot;; therefore, in their logical systems, it is impossible to formalize the cancellation of the presupposition that definite referents exist (Hirst, 1991; Marcu and Hirst, 1994). We can taxonomize previous approaches to defea3ible pragmatic inferences into three categories (we omit here work on defeasibility related to linguistic phenomena such as discourse, anaphora, or speech acts). 1. Most linguistic approaches account for the defeasibility of pragmatic inferences by analyzing them in a context that consists of all or some of the previous utterances, including the current one. Context (Karttunen, 1974; Kay, 1992), procedural rules (Gazdar, 1979; Karttunen and Peters, 1979), lexical and syntactic structure (Weischedel, 1979), intentions (Hirschberg, 1985), or anaphoric constraints (Sandt, 1992; Zeevat, 1992) decide what presuppositions or implicatures are projected as pragmatic inferences for the utterance that is analyzed. The problem with these approaches is that they assign a dual life to pragmatic inferences: in the initial stage, as members of a simple or complex utterance, they are defeasible. However, after that utterance is analyzed, there is no possibility left of cancelling that inference. But it is natural to have implicatures and presuppositions that are inferred and cancelled as a sequence of utterances proceeds: research in conversation repairs (Hirst et al., 1994) abounds in such examples. We address this issue in more detail in section 3.3. 2. One way of accounting for cancellations that occur later in the analyzed text is simply to extend the boundaries within which pragmatic inferences are evaluated, i.e., to look ahead a few utterances. Green (1992) assumes that implicatures are connected to discourse entities and not to utterances, but her approach still does not allow cancellations across discourse units. 3. Another way of allowing pragmatic inferences to be cancelled is to assign them the status of deinformation. Mercer (1987) formalizes pre- 144 Tu suppositions in a logical framework that handles defaults (Reiter, 1980), but this approach is not tractable and it treats natural disjunction as an exclusiveor and implication as logical equivalence. Computational approaches fail to account for the cancellation of pragmatic inferences: once presuppositions (Weischedel, 1979) or implicatures (Hirschberg, 1985; Green, 1992) are generated, they can never be cancelled. We are not aware of any formalism or computational approach that offers a unified explanation for the cancellability of pragmatic inferences in general, and of no approach that handles cancellations that occur in sequences of utterances. It is our aim to provide such an approach here. In doing this, we assume the existence, for each type of pragmatic inference, of a set of necessary conditions that must be true in order for that inference to be triggered. Once such a set of conditions is met, the corresponding inference is drawn, but it is assigned a defeasible status. It is the role of context and knowledge of the conversants to &amp;quot;decide&amp;quot; whether that inference will survive or not as a pragmatic inference of the structure. We put no boundaries upon the time when such a cancellation can occur, and we offer a unified explanation for pragmatic inferences that are inferable when simple utterances, complex utterances, or sequences of utterances are considered. We propose a new formalism, called &amp;quot;stratified logic&amp;quot;, that correctly handles the pragmatic inferences, and we start by giving a very brief introduction to the main ideas that underlie it. We give the main steps of the algorithm that is defined on the backbone of stratified logic. We then show how different classes of pragmatic inferences can be captured using this formalism, and how our algorithm computes the expected results for a representative class of pragmatic inferences. The results we report here are obtained using an implementation written in Common Lisp that uses Screamer (Siskind and McAllester, 1993), a macro package that provides nondeterministic constructs. 2 Stratified logic 2.1 Theoretical foundations We can offer here only a brief overview of stratified logic. The reader is referred to Marcu (1994) for a comprehensive study. Stratified logic supports one type of indefeasible information and two types of defeasible information, namely, infelicitously defeasible and felicitously defeasible. The notion of infelicitously defeasible information is meant to capture inferences that are anomalous to cancel, as in: * regrets that Mary came to the party but she did not come. The notion of felicitously defeasible information is meant to capture the inferences that can be cancelled without any abnormality, as in: Felicitously Defeasible Layer Infelicitously Defeasible Layer Undefeasible Layer Figure 1: The lattice that underlies stratified logic does not regret that Mary came to the party because she did not come. The lattice in figure 1 underlies the semantics of stratified logic. The lattice depicts the three levels of strength that seem to account for the inferences that pertain to natural language semantics and pragmatics: indefeasible information belongs to the u layer, infelicitously defeasible information belongs to the and felicitously defeasible information beto the Each layer is partitioned accorits polarity in truth, Ti, falsity, Is, The lattice shows a partial order that is over the different levels of truth. For examsomething that is indefeasibly false, is (in a sense to be defined below) something that is infelicitously defeasibly true, P, or felicidefensibly false, Id. Formally, say that the level is stronger than the which is stronger the u &lt; syntactic level, we allow atomic formulas to be labelled according to the same underlying lattice. Compound formulas are obtained in the usual way. This will give us formusuch as es (J ohn, come(M ary, party)) (M ary, party)), x)(--,bachelor• (x) —+ d (x) (x))). satisfaction relation is split according to the three levels of truth into u-satisfaction, i-satisfaction, and d-satisfaction: 2.1 a is an SG valuation such t = di E V and assume that SG maps p to relations RCDx For any formula and any stratified a, where x {u, i, and ti are terms, the x-satisfiability relations are defined as follows: Pu(ti, • • • ,t,,) . . E • • • , E U R&amp;quot; U • • • ,tn) c Pu(ti, • • • , (di, E • • • , tn) (di, ...,dn) • • • ,tn) U Rd • • • , tn) ...,dn) ..• , in) (di, E Rd 145 a • • • , . , Definition 2.1 extends in a natural way to negated and compound formulas. Having a satisfaction definition associated with each level of strength provides a high degree of flexibility. The same theory can be interpreted from a perspective that allows more freedom (u-satisfaction), or from a perspective that is tighter and that signals when some defeasible information has been cancelled (iand d-satisfaction). Possible interpretations of a given set of utterances with respect to a knowledge base are computed using an extension of the semantic tableau method. This extension has been proved to be both sound and complete (Marcu, 1994). A partial ordering, determines the set of a theory. An interpretation is preferred to, is more an interpretation m1 &lt; if it contains more information and that information can be more easily updated in the fu- That means that if an interpretation makes utterance true by assigning to a relation defeasible status, while another interpretation m1 makes the same utterance true by assigning the same stronger status, will be the preferred because it is as informative as m1 it allows more options in the future can defeated). Pragmatic inferences are triggered by utterances. To differentiate between them and semantic infewe introduce a new quantifier, whose semantics is defined such that a pragmatic inference of the form is instantiated for those objects the universe of discourse that pertain to an utterance having the form only if the antecedent of a pragmatic rule has been uttered can that rule be applied. A meta-logical construct uttered applies to the logical translation of utterances. This theory yields the following definition: 2.2 0 be a theory described in terms of stratified first-order logic that appropriately formalizes the semantics of lexical items and The necessary conditions that trigger pragmatic inferences. The semantics of lexical terms is formalized using quantifier the necessary conditions that pertain to pragmatic inferences are captured using \tut Let uttered(u) be the logical translation of a given utterance or set of utterances. We say that utu implicatesp and only if or pi is derived using pragmatic inferences in at least optimistic model of the theory 0 and if p is not cancelled by any stronger information (-pu ,-,p&apos;,-13d) in any optimistic model schema of the theory. Symmetrically, one can define what a negative pragmatic inference is. In both cases, uttered(u) is 2.2 The algorithm Our algorithm, described in detail by Marcu (1994), takes as input a set of first-order stratified formulas 0 that represents an adequate knowledge base that expresses semantic knowledge and the necessary conditions for triggering pragmatic inferences, and the translation of an utterance or set of utterances algorithm builds the set of all possible interpretations for a given utterance, using a generalization of the semantic tableau technique. The relation filters the interpretations. Among them, the defeasible inferences that have been triggered on pragmatic grounds are checked to see whether or not they are cancelled in any optimistic interpretation. Those that are not cancelled are labelled as pragmatic inferences for the given utterance or set of utterances. 3 A set of examples We present a set of examples that covers a representative group of pragmatic inferences. In contrast with most other approaches, we provide a consistent methodology for computing these inferences and for determining whether they are cancelled or not for _all possible configurations: simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances. 3.1 Simple pragmatic inferences 3.1.1 Lexical pragmatic inferences factive such as the verb its complement, but as we have seen, in positive environments, the presupposition is stronger: it is acceptable to defeat a presupposition triggered in a negative environment (2), but is infelicitous to defeat one that belongs to a positive environment (1). Therefore, an appropriate formalization of utterance (3) and the req.lisite pragmatic knowledge will be as shown in (4). (3) John does not regret that Mary came to the party. 1uttered(-,regretsu(john, s y, party))) , z)(regrets&amp;quot;(x , come(y, z)) —0 come&apos; (y, z)) z)(--iregrets&amp;quot;(x , come(y, z)) —* corned (y, z)) The stratified semantic tableau that corresponds to theory (4) is given in figure 2. The tableau yields two model schemata (see figure 3); in both of them, is defeasibly inferred that Mary came the party. model-ordering relation &lt; establishes as the optimistic model for the theory because it contains as much information as mi and is easier to defeat. explains why Mary came the party is presupposition for utterance (3). 146 come(rnary, party)) y, z)(--wegrets(x , corne(y, z)) z)) (V x , y, z)(regrets(x , corne(y, z)) —• come&apos; (y, z)) -wegrets(john, come(rnary, , party)) , party) regrets(john, come(mary , party)) (mary, party) corne(mary, party) u-closed -regrets(john, come(mary, party)) party) m_O 2: Stratified tableau for does not regret that Mary came to the party.

In fact all of them went to the theatre. 147 3.1.2 Scalar implicatures Consider utterance (5), and its implicatures (6). (5) John says that some of the boys went to the theatre. (6) Not {many/most/all} of the boys went to the theatre. An appropriate formalization is given in (7), where the second formula captures the defeasible scalar implicatures and the third formula reflects the relevant information for uttered(went(some(boys),theatre)) wentu (some(boys),theatre) wentu(all(boys),theatre) (wentu(most(boys),theatre)A wentu (many(boys), theatre)A wentu(some(boys), theatre)) The theory provides one optimistic model schema (figure 4) that reflects the expected pragmatic ini.e., most/Not many/Not all) of the boys went to the theatre. 3.1.3 Simple cancellation Assume now, that after a moment of thought, the same person utters: (8) John says that some of the boys went to the theatre. In fact all of them went to the theatre. By adding the extra utterance to the initial (7), would obtain one optimistic model schema in which the conventional implicatures have been cancelled (see figure 5). 3.2 Complex utterances The Achilles heel for most theories of presupposition has been their vulnerability to the projection problem. Our solution for the projection problem does not differ from a solution for individual utterances. Consider the following utterances and some of their associated presuppositions (11) (the symbol i&gt; precedes an inference drawn on pragmatic grounds): (9) Either Chris is not a bachelor or he regrets that Mary came to the party. (10) Chris is a bachelor or a spinster. r&gt; is a (male) adult. is not a bachelor that is a male adult; Chris regrets that Mary came to the party that Mary came the party. is no contradiction between these two presuppositions, so one would expect a conversant to infer both of them if she hears an utterance such as (9). However, when one examines utterance (10), one observes immediately that there is a contradiction between the presuppositions carried by the individual com- Being a bachelor presupposes that a male, being a spinster presupposes that is a female. we would expect a conversant to notice this contradiction and to drop each of these elementary presuppositions when she interprets (10). We now study how stratified logic and the modelordering relation capture one&apos;s intuitions. An appropriate formalization for utterance (9) and the necessary semantic and pragmatic knowledge is given in (12). tittered(-tbachelor(Chris)V ary, (-&apos;bachelor&amp;quot;(Chris)V come(M ary, party))) --q-ibachelord(Chris)A (Chris, come(Mary, -&apos;male(Mary) (Vx)(bacheloru (x) -+ (x) (x) marriedi(x)) (Vut x)(--thachelor&amp;quot;(x) adultd(x)) vus x)(-1bacheloru(x) maled(x)) y,z)(--wegretu (x , come(y, z)) corned (y, z)) (Vut x , y, z)(regr et&amp;quot; (x , come(y, z)) —■• come&apos; (y, z)) Besides the translation of the utterance, the initial theory contains a formalization of the defeasible implicature that natural disjunction is used as an exclusive or, the knowledge that Mary is not a name for the lexical semantics for the word the lexical pragmatics for The stratified semantic tableau generates 12 model schemata. Only four of them are kept as optimistic for the utterance. The models yield to the party; Chris is is an pragmatic inferences of utterance (9). Consider now utterance (10). The stratified semantic tableau that corresponds to its logical theory 16 models, but only is an adult definition 2.2 and is projected as presupposition for the utterance. 3.3 Pragmatic inferences in sequences of utterances We have already mentioned that speech repairs cona good benchmark for studying the genera- 148 tion and cancellation of pragmatic inferences along sequences of utterances (McRoy and Hirst, 1993). Suppose, for example, that Jane has two friends — John Smith and John Pevler — and that her roommate Mary has met only John Smith, a married fellow. Assume now that Jane has a conversation with Mary in which Jane mentions only the name John because she is not aware that Mary does not know about the other John, who is a five-year-old boy. In this context, it is natural for Mary to become confused and to come to wrong conclusions. For example, may reply that is not a bachelor. Although this is true for both Johns, it is more appropriate for the married fellow than for the five-yearold boy. Mary knows that John Smith is a married male, so the utterance makes sense for her. At this point Jane realizes that Mary misunderstands her: all the time Jane was talking about John Pevler, the five-year-old boy. The utterances in (13) constitute a possible answer that Jane may give to Mary in order to clarify the problem. No, John is not a bachelor. b. I regret that you have misunderstood me. c. He is only five years old. The first utterance in the sequence presuppo- C. is a male adult. Utterance (13)b warns Mary that is very likely she misunderstood a previous utterance (15). The warning is conveyed by implicature. c. hearer misunderstood the speaker. At this point, the hearer, Mary, starts to believe that one of her previous utterances has been elaborated on a false assumption, but she does not know which one. The third utterance (13)c comes to clarify the issue. It explicitly expresses that John is not an adult. Therefore, it cancels the early presupposition (14): V. is an adult. Note that there is a gap of one statement between the generation and the cancellation of this presupposition. The behavior described is mirrored both by our theory and our program. 3.4 Conversational implicatures in indirect replies The same methodology can be applied to modeling conversational implicatures in indirect replies (Green, 1992). Green&apos;s algorithm makes use of discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations. The following dialog is considered (Green, 1992, p. 68): Did you go shopping? A: a. My car&apos;s not running. b. The timing belt broke. c. (So) I had to take the bus. Answer (17) conveys a &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, but a reply consisting only of (17)a would implicate a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;. As Green notices, in previous models of implicatures (Gazdar, 1979; Hirschberg, 1985), processing (17)a will block the implicature generated by (17)c. Green solves the problem by extending the boundaries of the analysis to discourse units. Our approach does not exhibit these constraints. As in the previous example, the one dealing with a sequence of utterances, we obtain a different interpretation after each step. When the question is asked, there is no conversational implicature. Answer (17)a makes the necessary conditions for implicating &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; true, and the implication is computed. Answer (17)b reinforces a previous condition. Answer (17)c makes the preconditions for implicating a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; false, and the preconditions for implicating a &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; true. Therefore, the implicature at the end of the dialogue is that the conversant who answered went shopping. Unlike most research in pragmatics that focuses on certain types of presuppositions or implicatures, we provide a global framework in which one can express all these types of pragmatic inferences. Each pragmatic inference is associated with a set of necessary conditions that may trigger that inference. When such a set of conditions is met, that inference is drawn, but it is assigned a defeasible status. An extended definition of satisfaction and a notion of &amp;quot;optimism&amp;quot; with respect to different interpretations yield the preferred interpretations for an utterance or sequences of utterances. These interpretations contain the pragmatic inferences that have not been cancelled by context or conversant&apos;s knowledge, plans, or intentions. The formalism yields an algorithm that has been implemented in Common Lisp with Screamer. This algorithm computes uniformly pragmatic inferences that are associated with simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances, and allows cancellations of pragmatic inferences to occur at any time in the discourse.</abstract>

We can taxonomize previous approaches to defea3ible pragmatic inferences into three categories (we omit here work on defeasibility related to linguistic phenomena such as discourse, anaphora, or speech acts). 1. Most linguistic approaches account for the defeasibility of pragmatic inferences by analyzing them in a context that consists of all or some of the previous utterances, including the current one. Context (Karttunen, 1974; Kay, 1992), procedural rules (Gazdar, 1979; Karttunen and Peters, 1979), lexical and syntactic structure (Weischedel, 1979), intentions (Hirschberg, 1985), or anaphoric constraints (Sandt, 1992; Zeevat, 1992) decide what presuppositions or implicatures are projected as pragmatic inferences for the utterance that is analyzed. The problem with these approaches is that they assign a dual life to pragmatic inferences: in the initial stage, as members of a simple or complex utterance, they are defeasible. However, after that utterance is analyzed, there is no possibility left of cancelling that inference. But it is natural to have implicat</context>

As Green notices, in previous models of implicatures (Gazdar, 1979; Hirschberg, 1985), processing (17)a will block the implicature generated by (17)c. Green solves the problem by extending the boundaries of the analysis to discourse units. Our approach does not exhibit these constraints. As in the previous example, the one dealing with a sequence of utterances, we obtain a different interpretation after each step. When the question is asked, there is no conversational implicature.

To recognize normal state implicatures one must consider mutual beliefs and plans (Green, 1990).

But it is natural to have implicatures and presuppositions that are inferred and cancelled as a sequence of utterances proceeds: research in conversation repairs (Hirst et al., 1994) abounds in such examples. We address this issue in more detail in section 3.3. 2. One way of accounting for cancellations that occur later in the analyzed text is simply to extend the boundaries within which pragmatic inferences are evaluated, i.e., to look ahead a few utterances. Green (1992) assumes that implicatures are connected to discourse entities and not to utterances, but her approach still does not allow cancellations across discourse units. 3. Another way of allowing pragmatic inferences to be cancelled is to assign them the status of defeasible information. Mercer (1987) formalizes pre144 Tu J-11 suppositions in a logical framework that handles defaults (Reiter, 1980), but this approach is not tractable and it treats natural disjunction as an exclusiveor and implication as logical equivalence.

The third utterance (13)c comes to clarify the issue. It explicitly expresses that John is not an adult. Therefore, it cancels the early presupposition (14): (16) V. John is an adult. Note that there is a gap of one statement between the generation and the cancellation of this presupposition. The behavior described is mirrored both by our theory and our program. 3.4 Conversational implicatures in indirect replies The same methodology can be applied to modeling conversational implicatures in indirect replies (Green, 1992). Green&apos;s algorithm makes use of discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations. The following dialog is considered (Green, 1992, p. 68): (17) Q: Did you go shopping? A: a.

This paper provides a theoretical framework, called stratified logic, that can accommodate defeasible pragmatic inferences. The framework yields an algorithm that computes the conversational, conventional, scalar, clausal, and normal state implicatures; and the presuppositions that are associated with utterances. The algorithm applies equally to simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances. 1 Pragmatics and Defeasibility It is widely acknowledged that a full account of natural language utterances cannot be given in terms of only syntactic or semantic phenomena.

We are not aware of any formalism or computational approach that offers a unified explanation for the cancellability of pragmatic inferences in general, and of no approach that handles cancellations that occur in sequences of utterances. It is our aim to provide such an approach here. In doing this, we assume the existence, for each type of pragmatic inference, of a set of necessary conditions that must be true in order for that inference to be triggered. Once such a set of conditions is met, the corresponding inference is drawn, but i</context>

Context (Karttunen, 1974; Kay, 1992), procedural rules (Gazdar, 1979; Karttunen and Peters, 1979), lexical and syntactic structure (Weischedel, 1979), intentions (Hirschberg, 1985), or anaphoric constraints (Sandt, 1992; Zeevat, 1992) decide what presuppositions or implicatures are projected as pragmatic inferences for the utterance that is analyzed. The problem with these approaches is that they assign a dual life to pragmatic inferences: in the initial stage, as members of a simple or complex utterance, they are defeasible. However, after that utterance is analyzed, there is no possibility left of cancelling that inference. Bu</context>

We then show how different classes of pragmatic inferences can be captured using this formalism, and how our algorithm computes the expected results for a representative class of pragmatic inferences. The results we report here are obtained using an implementation written in Common Lisp that uses Screamer (Siskind and McAllester, 1993), a macro package that provides nondeterministic constructs. 2 Stratified logic 2.1 Theoretical foundations We can offer here only a brief overview of stratified logic. The reader is referred to Marcu (1994) for a comprehensive study. Stratified logic supports one type of indefeasible information and two types of defeasible information, namely, infelicitously defeasible and felicitously defeasible. The notion of infelicitously defeasible information is meant to capture inferences that are anomalous to cancel, as in: (1) * John regrets that Mary came to the party but she did not come. The notion of felicitously defeasible information is meant to capture the inferences that can be cancelled without any abnormality, as in: Felicitously Defeasible Layer Infelicitously Defeasible Layer Undefeasible La</context>

Having a satisfaction definition associated with each level of strength provides a high degree of flexibility. The same theory can be interpreted from a perspective that allows more freedom (u-satisfaction), or from a perspective that is tighter and that signals when some defeasible information has been cancelled (i- and d-satisfaction). Possible interpretations of a given set of utterances with respect to a knowledge base are computed using an extension of the semantic tableau method. This extension has been proved to be both sound and complete (Marcu, 1994). A partial ordering, &lt;, determines the set of optimistic interpretations for a theory. An interpretation mo is preferred to, or is more optimistic than, an interpretation m1 (mo &lt; mi) if it contains more information and that information can be more easily updated in the future. That means that if an interpretation mo makes an utterance true by assigning to a relation R a defeasible status, while another interpretation m1 makes the same utterance true by assigning the same relation R a stronger status, mo will be the preferred or optimistic one, because it is as informative as m1 and it allows</context>

Symmetrically, one can define what a negative pragmatic inference is. In both cases, 0 U uttered(u) is u-consistent. 2.2 The algorithm Our algorithm, described in detail by Marcu (1994), takes as input a set of first-order stratified formulas 0 that represents an adequate knowledge base that expresses semantic knowledge and the necessary conditions for triggering pragmatic inferences, and the translation of an utterance or set of utterances uttered(u). The algorithm builds the set of all possible interpretations for a given utterance, using a generalization of the semantic tableau technique. The model-ordering relation filters the optimistic interpretations. Among them, the defeasible inferences that have been triggered on pragmatic grounds are checked to see whether or not </context>

Assume now that Jane has a conversation with Mary in which Jane mentions only the name John because she is not aware that Mary does not know about the other John, who is a five-year-old boy. In this context, it is natural for Mary to become confused and to come to wrong conclusions. For example, Mary may reply that John is not a bachelor.
