As I leaf through my own &amp;quot;ACL (Historical)&amp;quot;
file (which, I am frightened to observe, goes back
to the Fourth Annual Meeting, in 1966), and focus
in particular on 1977, when I was President, it
strikes me that pretty much everything significant
that happened in the Association that year was the
work of other people. Don Walker was completing
the mammoth task of transferring all of the ACL&apos;s
records from the East Coast to the West, paying
off our indebtedness to the Center for Applied
Linguistics, and in general getting the Associa-
tion onto the firm financial and organizational
footing which it has enjoyed to this day. Dave
Hays was seeing to it that the microfiche journal
kept on coming, and George Heidorn joined him as
Associate Editor that year to begin the move
toward hard copy publication. That was the year
when we hitched up our organizational pants and
moved our Annual Meeting back to the Spring, after
some years when it had been in the Fall. Jonathan
Allen and his Program Committee coped admirably
with the challenge of putting on an Annual Meeting
program less than six months after the last one.
The culinary staff at the Foundry Restaurant in
Georgetown provided a banquet that I still remem-
ber as delicious.
AFIPS weighed in in a less constructive
fashion with their demand that we enroll a member-
ship of 1500 by a certain time (1982, I think) to
retain our status as full-fledged members, which
would require tripling our membership (maybe we&apos;ll
make it yet--who knows?). They were also respon-
sible for one of the non-events of the decade, the
abortive founding of abacus, which was to be the
Scientific American of computing. We pledged
$5,000 to the start-up costs on that, payable on
request, but they never got far enough to make the
request.
What of the field? The program for the 1977
Annual Meeting shows names which are mostly still
familiar to all of us, speaking on topics which
would not be out of place at the 1982 Annual
Meeting. I take this as a sign not of stagnation,
but of persevering people working on problems of
enormous complexity.
One event of 1977 may end up having more
impact on our field than anything the ACL did that
year. That was the year that the Sloan Foundation
made the first grants in its Particular Program
in Cognitive Science. It will be a long time
before we know all of the results of the ferment
that Program created, but it is already abundantly
clear that one result has been a massive increase
in the interested attention of theoretical
linguists to computational linguistics. This is
going to be beneficial to both fields, but
especially so, I think to computational linguis-
tics, by keeping our attention fixed on problems
far larger than making the program work.
