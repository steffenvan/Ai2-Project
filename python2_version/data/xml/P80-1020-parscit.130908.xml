A computerized conference (CC) is a form of communica-
tion in which participants type into and read from a
computer terminal. The participants may be on line at
the same time--termed a &amp;quot;synchrononous&amp;quot; conference, or
may interact asynchronously. The conversation is
stored and mediated by the computer.
Row does this form of communication change the process
and outcome of group discussions, as compared to the
&amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; face to face (FtF) medium of group discussion,
where participants communicate by talking, listening
and observing non-verbal behavior, and where there is
no lag between the sending and receipt of communication
signals? This paper briefly summarizes the results of
a controlled laboratory experiment designed to quantify
the manner in which conversation and group decision
making varies between FtF and CC. Those who wish more
detail are referred to the literature review which
served as the basis for the design of the experiment
(Hilts, 1975) and to the full technical report on the
results (Hiltz, Johnson, Aronovitch, and Turoff, 1980).
This paper is excerpted from a longer paper on the
analysis of communications process in the two media and
their correlates (Hiltz, Johnson and Rabke, 1980).

OVERVIEW OF THE EXPERIMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99645786440678">
The chief independent variable of interest is the im-
pact of computerized conferencing as a communications
mode upon the process and outcome of group decision
making, as compared to face-to-face discussions. Two
different types of tasks were chosen, and group size
was set at five persons. The subjects were Upsala
College undergraduate, graduate and continuing educa-
tion students. The communications process or profile
was quantified using Bales Interaction Process Analy-
sis (see Bales, 1950).
In computerized conferencing, each participant is
physically alone with a computer terminal attached to
a telephone. In order to communicate, he or she types
entries into the terminal and reads entries sent by the
other participants, rather than speaking and listening.
Entering input and reading output may be done totally
at the pace and time chosen by each individual. Con-
ceivably, for instance, all group members could be
entering comments simultaneously. Receipt of messages
from others is at the terminal print speed of 30 char-
acters per second.
Even when all five participants are on-line at the same
time, there is considerable lag in a computer confer-
ence between the time a discussant types in a comment,
and when a response to that comment is received.
First, each of the other participants must finish what
they are typing at the time; then they read the -
waiting item; then they may type in a response; then
the author of the original comment must finish his or
her typing of a subsequent item and print and read the
response. There is thus a definite &amp;quot;asynchronous&amp;quot;
quality even to &amp;quot;synchronous&amp;quot; computer conferences.
As a result, computer conferences often develop several
simultaneous threads of discussion that are being dis-
cussed concurrently, whereas face to face discussions
tend to focus on one single topic at a time and then
move on to subsequent topics. (See Hiltz and Turoff,
1978, for a complete description of CC as a mode of
communication).
A variable of secondary interest is problem type. Much
experimental literature indicates that the nature Of
the problem has a great deal to do with group perform-
ance. One type of problem that we used is the human
relations case as developed by Bales. These are
medium complex, unsettled problems that have no speci-
fic &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; answer. The second type was a &amp;quot;scienti-
fic&amp;quot; ranking problem (requiring no specific expertise),
which has a single correct solution plus measurable de-
grees of how nearly correct a group&apos;s answer may be.
The ranking problem, &amp;quot;Lost in the Arctic&amp;quot;, was adapted
for administration over a conferencing system by per-
mission of its originators (See Eady and Lafferty).
The experiments thus had a 2 x 2 factorial design (see
figure one). The factors were mode of communication
(face-to-face vs. computerized conference) and problem
type (human relations vs. a more &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; ranking
problem with a correct answer). These factors con-
stituted the &amp;quot;independent variables.&amp;quot; Each problem-
mode condition included a total of eight groups.

BACKGROUND: THE BALES EXPERIMENTS AND INTERACTION
PROCESS ANALYSIS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999827916666667">
Working at the Laboratory of Social Relations at Har-
vard, Bales and his colleagues developed a set of cate-
gories and procedures for coding the interaction in
small face-to-face decision-making groups which became
very widely utilized and generated a great deal of data
about the nature of communication and social processes
within such groups.
Coding of the communications interaction by Interaction
Process Analysis involves noting who makes a statement
or non-verbal participation (such as nodding agreement);
to whom the action was addressed; and into which of
twelve categories the action best fits. These cate-
gories are listed in subsequent tables and explained
below. The distribution of communications units among
the twelve categories constituted one of the main de-
pendent variables for this experiment. We expected
significant differences associated with mode of communi-
cation. We also expected some differences associated
with task type. We did not feel that we had enough
information to predict the directions of these differ-
ences. For almost every category, we could think of
some arguments that would lead to a prediction that the
category would be &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot; in CC, and some reasons why
it might be lower.

The number of Bales units per face to face group was
much greater than the number for a cc group. There-
fore, each individual and group was transformed to a
percentage distribution among the twelve categories.
Then statistical tests were performed to determine if
there were any significant differences in IPA distri-
butions associated with mode of communication, prob-
blem, order of problem, and the interaction among
these variables in relation to the percentage distri-
bution for each of the Bales categories.
There are many different ways in which the percentages
could be computed. To take full advantage of the de-
sign, we computed the percentage distribution for each
individual, in each condition. Thus, we actl,ally have
the Bales distributions for each of 80 individuals in
a face to face conference, and in a computerized con-
ference.
The mode of analysis was a two by two factorial nested
design. If there was no significant group effect,
then the error terms could be &amp;quot;pooled&amp;quot;, meaning we
could use the 80 observations as independent obser-
vations for statistical test purposes. We also per-
formed a non-parametric test on the data. for each
Bales category, which gave us similar results.
DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH COMMUNICATION MODE
Two of the detailed analysis of variance tables on
which the summary here is based are included as an
Appendix. Note that the analyses were first performed
separately for the two problems, using communication
mode as the independent variable. For each problem,
we tested the significance of mode of communication,
order (whether it was the first or second problem
solved by the group), and the interaction between mode
and order.
Listed in figures two and three is a summary of the
statistical results of the 24 analyses of variance
which examined observed differences between communi-
cation modes for each of the two tasks. The first two
columns show the mean percentage of communications in
each category. For example, in the first table, re-
sults for Forest Ranger, the first column shows that
on the average less than 1% of an individual&apos;s communi-
cations were verbally &amp;quot;showing solidarity&amp;quot;, but in CC,
3.22% fell into this category. The third column shows
that the results for the 16 groups in the nested factor-
ial design were significant at the .005 level, meaning
that the probability of the observed differences oc-
curing by chance in a sample this size is one in 200.
The fourth column shows the level of significance if
the group was not a significant variable and the obser-
vations could be pooled, with the 80 individuals
treated as independent observations. In this case,
group was significant, so the pooled analysis could not
be done.
In looking at these data, there is an apparent coding
problem. Even for the Forest Ranger problem, face to
face, we obtained a somewhat different distribution of
coding than did persons coding problem discussions such
as this who were directly trained by Bales. (See Bales
and Borgatta, 1955, P. 400 for the complete c.&apos;qtribu-
tions). Our coding has 20% more of the statemtats
classified as &amp;quot;giving opinions&amp;quot; than Bales and Borgatta
code, and correspondingly lower percentages in all of
the other categories. This means that our results
cannot be directly compared to those of other investi-
gators, since apparently the training for coding inter-
preted many more statements as representing some sort
of analysis or opinion than &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; be there, accord-
ing to the distributions obtained for similar studies
by Bales and his colleagues. (Other possible explana-
tions are that Upsala College has produced an unusually
opinionated and analytic set of students or that the
effect of pre-experimental training in cc raises
opinion giving even in subsequent FtF discussions.)
It does not affect the comparisons among problems and
modes for this study, since all of the coders were
coding the data with the same guidelines and inter-
pretations. In the majority of cases, the same pair
of coders coded both the CC and FtF condition for the
same group. In any case, the seven individuals who
did the coding had been trained to an acceptable level
of reliability.

DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997664">
The twelve categories in Bales Interaction Process
Analysis can be combined into four main functional
areas. Categories 1-3 and 10-12 are the &amp;quot;social-emo-
tional&amp;quot; functions, oriented towards internal group pro-
cess. The first three are called &amp;quot;social-emotional
positive&amp;quot;, while 10-12 are &amp;quot;negative&amp;quot;. Categories 7-9
are &amp;quot;Task oriented&amp;quot;, giving answers or contributions to
solving the problem faced by the group, and categories
4-6 are varieties of &amp;quot;asking questions&amp;quot; in the task
oriented area.
It will be noted, by way of further introduction, that
there are some very strong differences in the profiles,
even in the same medium, depending upon the type of
task faced by the group, and that there is some inter-
action between task type and medium. For example, more
tension was shown in the arctic problem in the CC con-
dition; more in the Forest Ranger problem in the FTF
condition.
We will take each of the categories, deL.cribing more
fully what is included in them, and then discuss the
extent to which there appear to be significant differ-
ences between the media in the relative prevalence of
communications of that type. We will also try to ex-
plain the possible reasons for or Implications of sig-
nificant differences that are discovered.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9679985">
1. &amp;quot;Shows solidarity, raises other&apos;s status, gives help,
reward&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991596">
Included in this category are initial and responsive
acts of active solidarity and affection, such as saying
&amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; and making friendly or congenial remarks to
&amp;quot;break the ice&amp;quot;; praising or encouraging the other(s);
giving support or sympathy or offers of assistance;
urging harmony and cooperation. These are all overt
attempts to improve the solidarity of the group.
Note that there is a significantly greater amount of
&amp;quot;showing solidarity&amp;quot; in computerized conferencing.
This is probably because much of the behavior of this
type in a face to face situation is non-verbal, such
as smiling in a friendly manner while nodding encourage-
ment. Non verbal acts in this category are not codable
from the tapes of the discussions. In the CC condition,
however, the participants realize that they must put
such things into words.
Another possible explanation is that the greater ten-
dency towards overt, explicit showing of solidarity is
an attempt to compensate for the perceived coldness and
impersonality of the medium.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.910509">
2. &amp;quot;Shows Tension Release, jokes, laughs, shows satis-
faction&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989857095238095">
This includes expressions of pleasure or happiness,
making friendly jokes or kidding remarks, laughing.
There was significantly more tension release overtly
expressed in the face to face groups. Much of this
was waves of laughter, particularly in the arctic prob-
lem. The participants did not put this into words in
the conference when typing. Observing them, however,
there was much private laughter and verbal expressions
showing &amp;quot;tension release&amp;quot;, but these do not appear in
3. &amp;quot;Agrees, shows passive acceptance, understands, con-
curs, complies&amp;quot;
This occurs as concurrence in a proposed course of
action or carrying out of any activity which has been
requested by others. There is significantly more
agreement overtly expressed in face to face confer-
ences than in computerized conferences. We suspect
that this is related to the pressure to conform
created by non-verbal behavior and the physical
presence of the other group members. In any case,
it is undoubtedly related to the greater difficulty
of CC groups in reaching total consensus.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9197605">
4. &amp;quot;Gives Suggestion, directioa, implying autonomy for
other&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.93469180952381">
Includes giving suggestions about the task or sugges-
ting concrete actions in the near term to attain a
group goal. There is a tendency for more suggestions
to be given by more people in computerized conferenc-
ing. This is part of the equalitarian tendency for
more members to actively participate in the task behav-
ior of a group in CC. In one of the problems, the
difference was statistically significant at the .05 le-
vel; whereas in the other, it was sizable but did not
reach statistical significance.
5. &amp;quot;Gives opinion, evaluation, analysis, expresses
feeling, wish&amp;quot;
Includes all reasoning or expressions of evaluation or
interpretation.
This is the most frequent type of communication for
both problems and both modes. For the Bales problem,
there was no difference in its prevalence associated
with mode of communication. For the Arctic problem,
however, there las a large and statistically significant
difference, with more opinion giving in the CC condi-
tion.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.639171">
6. &amp;quot;Gives Orientation, information, repeats, clarifies,
confirms&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.934214538461539">
This includes statements that are meant to secure the
attention of the other, (such as &amp;quot;There are two points
I&apos;d like to make...&amp;quot;), restating or reporting the essen-
tial content of what the group has read or said; non-
inferential, descriptive generalizations or summaries of
the situation facing the group. There are no clear dif-
ferences here. Whereas there is a statistically signif-
icant difference in the direction of giving more orien-
tation in CC for Forest Ranger, for the other problem,
the difference is reversed.
7. &amp;quot;Asks for orientation, information, repetition and
confirmation&amp;quot;
There is a significant tendency for this to occur more
often in face to face discussions. This is probably
because of the frequency with which a group member does
not hear or understand the pronunciation of a sentence
or partial utterance. In Cc, people are usually more
careful to state their thoughts clearly, and the recipi-
ent can read it several times rather than asking for
repetition if it is not understood the first time or is
later forgotten. We have noticedmany CC participants
going back and looking at comments a second or third
in a face to face discussion, they would probably ask
something like: &amp;quot;What was it you said before about x?&amp;quot;.

<bodyText confidence="0.999779111111111">
This occurs more frequently in computerized confer-

reached statistical significance, whereas it did
not for the other. This tendency to more frequent-
ly and explicitly ask for the opinions of all the
other group members, as well as to more spontane-
ously offer ones own opinions and analyses in CL,
does seem to qualitatively be characteristic of
the medium.

9. &amp;quot;Asks for suggestion, direction, possible ways

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986301379310345">
This includes all overt, explicit requests, such
as &amp;quot;What shall we do now?&amp;quot;. It is not very preva-
lent in either medium, and there are no significant
differences.
10. &amp;quot;Disagrees, shows passive rejection, formal-
ity, witholds resources&amp;quot;
This includes all the milder forms of disagreement
or refusal to comply or reciprocate. This is also
an infrequent form of communication, but it occurs
more in face to face discussions than in CC.
11. &amp;quot;Shows tension, asks for help, withdraws out
of field&amp;quot;
Includes indications that the subject feels anxious
or frustrated, with no particular other group mem-
ber as the focus of these negative feelings. The
results on this are rather puzzling. We end up
with a statistically significant tendency for there
to be more tensions when in CC for the Forest Ran-
ger problem, but in FTP for the Arctic problem.
Substantively, the proportion of these communica
tions is very small in any case, and therefore,
the small differences are not important.
12. &amp;quot;Shows antagonism, deflates other&apos;s status, de-
fends or asserts self&amp;quot;
This includes autocratic attempts to control or di-
rect others, rejection or refusal of a request, de-
riding or criticizing others.
This is infrequent in both media and there are no
significant differences.

EFFECTS OF ORDER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999662">
For the most part, it did not matter whether the CC or
the FtF discussion was held first. However, more
suggestions were offered on the arctic problem if it
was discussed in CC as the first problem, but more
in FTP discussion if the FTP was preceeded by a CC
condition. This is consistent with the tendency for
CC to promote more giving of suggestions; apparently,
the tendency carries over to a subsequent face to face
conversation. This raises the interesting possibi.ity
that the group process and structure can be permanently
changed by the experience of interacting through CC, a
change that will carry over even to communications in
other modes. Other pieces of evidence from other
studies, including self reports of participants in
long term field trials, indicate the same possibility.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962333333333">
Our investigation confirms the hypothesis that there
are some significant differences in the group com-
munication process between face to face and compu-
ter mediated discussions. Such differences seem to
be associated with other characteristics of the
medium, such as the greater tendency for minority
opinions to be maintained, rather than a total
group consensus emerging. In a fuller analysis (Hiltz,
Johnson, Aronovitch and Turoff, 1980) we show that the
observed differences in interaction profiles are highly
correlated with the ability of a group to reach con-
sensus and &apos;with the quality of group decision reached.
