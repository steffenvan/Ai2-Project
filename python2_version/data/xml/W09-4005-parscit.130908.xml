In this paper, we report a work in progress on
transforming syntactic structures from the Syn-
TagRus corpus into tectogrammatical trees in
the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) style.
SynTagRus (Russian) and PDT (Czech) are both
dependency treebanks sharing lots of common
features and facing similar linguistic challenges
due to the close relatedness of the two languages.
While in PDT the tectogrammatical representa-
tion exists, sentences in SynTagRus are anno-
tated on syntactic level only.

Treebanking in Prague comprises not only the anno-
tations of Czech. Besides the main project of Prague
Dependency Treebank (PDT) [3], there are several
other projects using the same schema for annotating
other languages. We should mention the Prague Ara-
bic Dependency Treebank (PADT) [4] and Prague En-
glish Dependency Treebank (PEDT) [1], which con-
tains texts from Wall Street journal manually anno-
tated in the PDT style. The Prague Czech-English
Dependency Treebank (PCEDT) [2] was developed by
translating PEDT into Czech and annotating it also
on the Czech side.
Our goal is to convert the Russian corpus SynTa-
gRus [7] into the PDT annotation scheme and build
the tectogrammatical (deep-syntactic) layer for Rus-
sian. We also develop a small Russian-Czech paral-
lel treebank so that we can compare the two closely-
related languages and study structural similarities and
differences, which could be useful for developing ma-
chine translation systems.

<bodyText confidence="0.886808705882353">
Prague Dependency Treebank (version 2.0) [3] is a
treebank of Czech, which consists of three interlinked
annotation layers: the morphological layer, the ana-
lytical layer (describing the surface syntax) and the
tectogrammatical layer (describing the deep syntax –
transition between syntax and semantics). A highly
simplified example of the annotation layers is in Fig-
ure 1. The theoretical background of PDT has its
roots in the Prague School of Functional and Struc-
tural Linguistics, and especially in the language de-
scription framework called Functional Generative De-
scription [9]. The following paragraphs summarize the
main features of the three layers.

At the morphological layer (m-layer), a sentence is
divided into tokens (words, punctuation marks, and
other symbols). Lemma and positional morphological
tag are assigned to each token.
At the analytical layer (a-layer), a rooted depen-
dency tree is being build for every sentence. Every to-
ken from the morphological layer becomes exactly one
node in the analytical tree. Only one node – the “tech-
nical” root – is added. An analytical function (such as
Subject, Object, Attribute) is assigned to each node,
but in fact it captures the type of dependency relation
between the given node and its parent node. However,
there are also edges representing non-dependency re-
lations (e.g. in coordination structures).
At the tectogrammatical layer (t-layer), each sen-
tence is represented as a complex deep-syntactic de-
pendency tree (tectogrammatical tree), in which only
autosemantic words have nodes of their own. Func-
tional words like prepositions, subordinating conjunc-
tions, auxiliary verbs, and modal verbs are represented
in the respective nodes in the form of their attributes.
On the other hand, tectogrammatical trees contain
nodes that have no counterparts in the surface shape
of the sentences, for instance nodes corresponding to
‘pro-dropped’ subjects. Each node has its tectogram-
matical lemma, functor (which determines the type of
semantic relation between the node and its parent),
semantic part of speech, grammatemes (semantically-
oriented counterparts of morphological categories such
as aspect, degree of comparison, modality, gender, it-
erativeness, negation, number, person, or tense).
The corpus contains 115,844 sentences (1,957,247
tokens including punctuation and other special char-
acters) from newspapers and scientific articles. All of
them are annotated on the m-layer, 75% on the a-layer
and 45% on all three layers.

2.2 SynTagRus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9940395">
SynTagRus is a syntactically annotated corpus of Rus-
sian based on the theory &amp;quot;Meaning-Text&amp;quot; [6]. In Syn-
TagRus, sentences are represented as trees, in which
words are nodes and edges between them are marked
with the appropriate syntactic relation. Unlike in
PDT, punctuation marks are not annotated in Syn-
TagRus. They are included, but do not carry any la-
beling and they are not included in syntactic trees.
An annotated sentence from SynTagRus is depicted in
Figure 2.
Each word (node in a tree) has five attributes in the
SynTagRus XML format:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982371666666667">
• id – linear position of the word in the sentence,
• dom – id of its parent node,
• lemma – morphological lemma,
• feat – morphological tag.&apos; Part of speech at the
first position is followed by a sequence of respec-
tive features (e. g. number, gender, case, person,
aspect, tense, ...),
• link – syntactic relation&apos; between the node and its
parent. It can be for example ‘iредик’ (between
a verb and its complement), ‘1-комiл’ (between
a verb and its direct object), ‘iредл’ (between a
preposition and a noun), and many others.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9345215">
The whole corpus contains 32,242 sentences and
461,297 tokens (excluding punctuation). Most of the
texts are from journal articles and newspapers, but
there are also texts belonging to the fiction genre.

3 Adaptation of tectogrammati-
cal layer for Russian
Here we discuss the ongoing process of constructing
tectogrammatical representation on the basis of mor-
phological information and syntactic relations. The
conversion will be described in several steps.

3.1 Format conversion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999659">
Both PDT and SynTagRus are represented in XML
based formats. In the case of PDT a special PML for-
mat was developed [8]. SynTagRus XML format was
therefore transfered into PML, so that we can use the
TectoMT1 software framework [12] and TrEd2 viewer.
As we can see from the corpora description, SynTa-
gRus annotation covers all the features that are neces-
sary to build morphological and analytical layer. The
third – tectogrammatical layer will be derived from
these two layers in the next steps.

<bodyText confidence="0.999974769230769">
Coordination relations do not belong among depen-
dency relations. Their handling in SynTagRus is dif-
ferent from the PDT style. We will call the coordi-
nated words (or clauses) coordination members, the
word which governs all the coordination members will
be common parent and the words depending on all the
members will be common dependents.
In SynTagRus, according to the Meaning Text The-
ory [6], the first member of coordination is attached
to the common parent. Common dependents are at-
tached to the nearest member, often to the first one.
Each other coordination member including conjunc-
tions is attached to the previous member as it is
depicted in Figure 3. The edges between coordina-
tion members are labeled by ‘ño÷xí’ (composition re-
lation) or ‘ño÷-ñoþçí’ (composition-with-conjunction
relation).
In our example, the verbs ‘òonaëx’ (stamped),
‘ñâxñòåëx’ (whistled), and ‘ðañõoäxëxñü’ (left) are
coordinated. They are head of the sentence (the
first member is attached to the technical root
‘SruA’) and have one common dependent, the subject
‘Ñoáðaâøxåñÿ’ (People), which is attached to the first
member ‘òonaëx’.
The same sentence but with the coordination han-
dled in the PDT style is depicted in Figure 4. All
members of coordination are attached here to the con-
junction, the common dependent ‘Ñoáðaâøxåñÿ’ is at-
tached also to the conjunction. Members of coordina-
tion are distinguished from common dependents with
the special attribute ‘_co’.
The advantages and disadvantages of these two dif-
ferent handling of coordinations are discussed in more
detail in [11]. Mel’cuk’s approach needs less mem-
ory compared to PDT, because it needs no special at-
tributes ‘_co’ for marking coordinating members. It
seems that it is also more suitable for annotators (miss-
ing ‘_co’ attribute was very common and problematic
error in PDT). On the other hand, Mel’cuk’s theory

can not reflect inner structure of coordination con-
structions (for example in ‘Peter and Mary or Charlie
and Suzanne’) and does not allow different syntactic
relations of coordinated words.
Several problems occurred in automatic conversion
of coordinations into PDT style.
Firstly, it is not distinguished in SynTagRus
whether a dependent of a member of coordination
actually refers to the whole coordination or only
to that one member. In our example, the words
‘Ñoáðaâøxåñÿ’ (People) and ‘íoãaìx’ (feet) are at-
tached both to the first coordination member ‘òonaëx’
(stamped). While ‘Ñoáðaâøxåñÿ’ is a common depen-
dent, the word ‘íoãaìx’ depends on the first member
only – on the word ‘òonaëx’. The authors of SynTa-
gRus treebank decided not to distinguish them, be-
cause this is a notorious source of ambiguity in many
cases, for example in ‘old men and women’ vs. ‘old
men and women whose age is not specified’. Never-
theless, the PDT representation requires this ambigu-
ity to be resolved. The disambiguation can be par-
tially facilitated by a couple of rules. For instance, a
subject belonging to the coordinated verbs is almost
certain the common subject if there is no other sub-
ject in the sentence. This is just the case of the word

‘Собравшиеся’ (People). But by far not all cases can
be solved.
Secondly, since punctuation marks are not included
in the trees in SynTagRus, it is often the case that
there is no node that could serve as the coordination
head. In such situations, all coordination members are
attached on their common parent instead on a con-
junction. We also can not deal with common depen-
dents in such structures, but this problem arises very
rarely.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991162">
3.3 Function words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.933875227272727">
Function words (e. g. prepositions, subordinating con-
junctions and auxiliary verbs) do not have their own
nodes in the tectogrammatical trees. The conversion
from analytical trees (in which every word is repre-
sented by one node) is done in several steps. Each
function word is first marked and assigned to one of
the content words. Afterwards the tectogrammatical
tree is build using only content (non-function) words as
nodes. The meaning of the function words is then ex-
pressed by functors and grammatemes (the attributes
of respective content-word nodes).
An example of conversion from analytical tree into
tectogrammatical tree is depicted in Figures 5 and 6.
For example, the prepositional phrase ‘в воду’ is
represented by the node ‘вода’ in the tectogrammati-
cal layer. The preposition ‘в’ is reflected in the functor
‘DIR3’, which means to where.
Some of the rules we use for assignment of function
words to content words follow.
1. prepositions – A preposition is assigned to its
child node (a noun), if the syntactic relation is
‘предл’ (prepositional).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.756359">
29
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.939910769230769">
2. passive forms – If there are two verbs which syn-
tactic relation is ‘ïaññ-aíaë’ (analytical-passive)
and the lemma of the parent verb is ‘ábiTü’ (to
be), the parent verb is assigned as a functional
word to the child verb.
3. future tense – In Russian (as well as in Czech)
future tense of imperfective verbs is expressed an-
alytically as ‘to be’ + infinitive, e. g. ‘áóäóT
ïoëüçoâaTüñSI’ (will use). Therefore, the rule is:
If there are two verbs, their relation is ‘aíaëèT’
(analytical), the lemma of the parent verb is
‘ábiTü’ (to be), and the child verb is in infinitive
form, the parent verb is assigned to the child.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997419666666667">
4. subordinated conjunctions – Conjunctions
‘TITo’ (that), ‘TIToábi’ (so that), or ‘ïoToMó TITo‘
(because) are assigned to their child nodes, if the
syntactic relation between them is ’ïoäTI-ñoioçí’
(subordinate clause with conjunction).
5. modal verbs – A verb which lemma is ‘õoTeTü’
(want), ‘MoTIü’ (can), ‘íaäo’ (should), or ‘äoëxceí’
(must) is assigned to its child node, if the child
node is verb in infinitive form.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.899139">
3.4 Elided ’to be’
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996078090909091">
In Czech, personal pronouns in subject positions are
often dropped and have to be added (reconstructed) at
the tectogrammatical layer. Analogically, we add spe-
cial nodes into Russian tectogrammatical trees if the
Russian verb ‘to be’ is dropped in the surface sentence
shape, as it is for example in ‘ß ñTóäeíT’ (I [am] a stu-
dent). This is currently approximated by the following
simple heuristics: if there is a ‘ïðeäèx’ (predicate) re-
lation between two nodes and the parent node is not a
verb, then generate a new node labeled with ‘#ToBe’
and attach both previously existing nodes below it (see

3.5 Assigning functors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999839386363636">
Syntactic relations in SynTagRus bare not only syntac-
tic information, but they go deeper towards semantic
relations. Labels of semantic relations are called func-
tors in the PDT terminology.
Yet, the classification of this relations within this
two frameworks is very different, only a few of them
can be mapped as one-to-one. It is for example ap-
position (syntactic relation ‘aïïoç’ goes to the functor
APPS), parenthetical relation (‘ïðèMbixaT’ → PAR),
and comparative relation (‘ñðaâíèT’ → CPR).
There are five functors for verb arguments in PDT:
actor (ACT), patient (PAT), effect (EFF), addressee
(ADDR), and origin (ORIG). We expected them to
be closely-related to the completive syntactic relations
within SynTagRus (1-xoMïë, 2-xoMïë, 3-xoMïë, 4-
xoMïë, 5-xoMïë). The apparent correspondence is
between the functor PAT and syntactic relation ‘1-
xoMïë’ e. g. in ‘oí TIèTaeT ïèñüMo.PAT’ (he is reading
a letter.PAT). The functor ACT (actor) is often the
subject of the sentence and corresponds to ‘ïðeäèx’.
Other relations however do not straightforwardly
correspond to the PDT-style functors. In order to as-
sign functors properly we need to know cognitive role
of the word, but the argument relations in SynTagRus
hardly give this information. Therefore we use several
additional rules, for instance: If the relation between
a verb and its child node is completive (?-xoMïë) and
the child node is a noun in dative case, we assign the
functor ADDR (addressee) to it. Example: ‘Îí äaë
ðeáeíxó.ADDR èãðóøxó’ (He gave to a child.ADDR
a toy).
Some other functors are assigned using lexical list.
For example, the words ‘TIToábi’ (to), ‘â èíTeðeñaõ’
(in order to, ‘ñ öeëüio’ (with the aim of ) usually cor-
respond to the functor AIM. A preposition ‘â’ (in, to)
corresponds either to the functor LOC (where), if the
noun is in locative case, or to the functor DIR3 (to
where) for accusative case. A preposition ‘â’ followed
by a noun representing a time, for example Monday,
January, yesterday, week, corresponds to the functor
TWHEN (when). A set of such temporal nouns is not
too large to make a satisfactory list of them manually.
You can see an application of the described rules for
functors assignment in Figure 6.

4 Small parallel treebank
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995294117647">
We have built a small Russian-Czech parallel tree-
bank. Luckily, there exist Czech translations for some
of the prose texts included in SynTagRus. We have
found one such book which contains Czech translation
of one chunk in SynTagRus. We acquired 480 paral-
lel sentences, so that we can compile a small parallel
treebank. Whereas the Russian side is largely man-
ually annotated (only the transfer form SynTagRus
to tectogrammatics is automatic), the annotation on
the Czech side is fully automatic. We use Morce tag-
ger [10], McDonald maximum spanning tree depen-
dency parser [5] and other mainly rule based scripts
to generate the tectogrammatical layer. The corpus
was compiled using TectoMT [12] framework, which
includes all these tools. This parallel treebank, even
if very small at the moment, can be once a valuable
source of information in comparative language studies.

into the PDT format, we changed the representation
of coordination constructions, because their handling
is very different in SynTagRus and in PDT. We hid
the auxiliary words, that do not have their own nodes
in the tectogrammatical layer, and the elided verbs ‘to
be’ were added. We started with assigning functors
(the deep-syntactic relations between tectogrammati-
cal nodes).
In the future, we plan to continue with adding
more (often more complex) rules for assigning func-
tors. Other attributes as grammatemes are also going
to be assigned to the tectogrammatical nodes.
As for the parsed parallel corpus, we also plan to
experiment with aligning the tectogrammatical struc-
tures of the two languages on the node level.

<abstract confidence="0.9995305">In this paper, we report a work in progress on transforming syntactic structures from the Syn- TagRus corpus into tectogrammatical trees in the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) style. SynTagRus (Russian) and PDT (Czech) are both dependency treebanks sharing lots of common features and facing similar linguistic challenges due to the close relatedness of the two languages. While in PDT the tectogrammatical representation exists, sentences in SynTagRus are annotated on syntactic level only.</abstract>

The corpus contains 115,844 sentences (1,957,247 tokens including punctuation and other special characters) from newspapers and scientific articles. All of them are annotated on the m-layer, 75% on the a-layer and 45% on all three layers. 2.2 SynTagRus SynTagRus is a syntactically annotated corpus of Russian based on the theory &amp;quot;Meaning-Text&amp;quot; [6]. In SynTagRus, sentences are represented as trees, in which words are nodes and edges between them are marked with the appropriate syntactic relation. Unlike in PDT, punctuation marks are not annotated in SynTagRus. They are included, but do not carry any labeling and they are not included in syntactic trees. An annotated sentence from SynTagRus is depicted in Figure 2. Each word (node in a tree) has five attributes in the SynTagRus XML format: • id – linear position of the word in the sentence, • dom – id of its parent node, • lemma – morphological lemma, • feat – morphological tag.&apos; Part of</context>

Coordination relations do not belong among dependency relations. Their handling in SynTagRus is different from the PDT style. We will call the coordinated words (or clauses) coordination members, the word which governs all the coordination members will be common parent and the words depending on all the members will be common dependents. In SynTagRus, according to the Meaning Text Theory [6], the first member of coordination is attached to the common parent. Common dependents are attached to the nearest member, often to the first one. Each other coordination member including conjunctions is attached to the previous member as it is depicted in Figure 3. The edges between coordination members are labeled by ‘ño÷xí’ (composition relation) or ‘ño÷-ñoþçí’ (composition-with-conjunction relation). In our example, the verbs ‘òonaëx’ (stamped), ‘ñâxñòåëx’ (whistled), and ‘ðañõoäxëxñü’ (left) are coordinated.

The same sentence but with the coordination handled in the PDT style is depicted in Figure 4. All members of coordination are attached here to the conjunction, the common dependent ‘Ñoáðaâøxåñÿ’ is attached also to the conjunction. Members of coordination are distinguished from common dependents with the special attribute ‘_co’. The advantages and disadvantages of these two different handling of coordinations are discussed in more detail in [11]. Mel’cuk’s approach needs less memory compared to PDT, because it needs no special attributes ‘_co’ for marking coordinating members. It seems that it is also more suitable for annotators (missing ‘_co’ attribute was very common and problematic error in PDT).
