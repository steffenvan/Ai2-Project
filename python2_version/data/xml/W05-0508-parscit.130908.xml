Reali &amp; Christiansen (2003, 2004) have challenged
Chomsky’s most famous &amp;quot;poverty of stimulus&amp;quot;
claim (Chomsky, 1980) by showing that a
statistical learner which tracks transitional
probabilities between adjacent words (bigrams)
can correctly differentiate grammatical and
ungrammatical auxiliary inversion in questions like
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.975447333333333">
(1) and (2):
(1) Is the little boy who is crying hurt?
(2) *Is the little boy who crying is hurt?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.947473176470588">
No examples like (1) occurred in the corpus that
R&amp;C employed, yet the grammatical form was
chosen by the bigram model in 92% of the test
sentence pairs. R&amp;C conclude that no innate
knowledge is necessary to guide child learners in
making this discrimination, because the input
evidently contains enough indirect statistical
information (from other sentence types) to lead
learners to the correct generalization.
R&amp;C&apos;s data are impressive, but there is reason to
doubt that they extend to other natural languages or
even to other constructions in English. While
replicating R&amp;C&apos;s Experiment 1 (see Data [A]), we
discovered that its success rests on &apos;accidental&apos;
English facts.
Six bigrams differ between the grammatical and
ungrammatical versions of a sentence. (The 6
relevant bigrams for the test sentence pair (1)/(2)
are shown in Table 1.) However, 86% of the
correctly predicted test sentences were definitively
selected by the single bigram &amp;quot;who is&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;that
is&amp;quot;), because it occurred in the corpus and none of
the remaining 5 bigrams did.

Table 1. Six bigrams that differentiate Is the little
boy who is crying hurt? from Is the little boy who
crying is hurt? The first sentence is selected (as
grammatical) solely due to the high probability of
who is.
It can be anticipated that when there is no
bigram “who/that is” in the grammatical test

sentence (e.g., in relative clauses with object-gaps,
auxiliaries such as was, can, or do-support), the
learning will be less successful. Our results
confirm this prediction: object relatives like (4)
and (5), where &amp;quot;who/that is” is not present, were
poorly discriminated (see Data [B]).

Results for sentences with only main verbs,
requiring do-support in question-formation, like (6)
and (7), were also very weak (see Data [C]).

Furthermore, the powerful effect of &amp;quot;who/that
is&amp;quot; in R&amp;C’s experiment reflects no knowledge of
relative clauses. It rests on the homophony of
English relative pronouns with interrogative &amp;quot;who&amp;quot;
and deictic &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;. In R&amp;C&apos;s training-set, the
phonological/orthographic form &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; occurred as
relative pronoun only 3 times, but as interrogative
pronoun 44 times. R&amp;C&apos;s analysis didn&apos;t
differentiate these. (Similarly for &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;: 14 relative
versus 778 deictic or complementizer.)
In some languages relative pronouns are
homophonous with other parts of speech (e.g., with
determiners in German). We explored the possible
effects of this by replacing the relative pronouns in
the English corpus with “the”. Discrimination
between grammatical and ungrammatical aux-
inversion was poor (see Data [D]).
Many human languages lack any such
superficial overlaps with relative pronouns. So
unless there are other cues instead, learning can be
expected to be unsuccessful in those languages too.
We tested this hypothesis in two ways:
(i) We distinguished relative pronouns from their
non-relative homophones in English by coding
the former as “who-rel” and “that-rel” in both
the corpus and the test sentences. We found a
greatly reduced ability to select the grammatical
aux-inversion construction (see Data [E]).
(ii) We tested verb fronting in Dutch questions,
using a Dutch corpus comparable to the English
corpus used by R&amp;C (the Groningen Dutch
corpus from CHILDES; approximately 21,000
utterances of child-directed speech, age 1;8 to
1;11). Due largely to verb-final word order in
relative clauses, there was no one distinctive
bigram that could be relied on to predict the
correct choice. Performance on a set of 20 items
tested so far was no better than chance (see
Data [F]). Clearly, the Dutch examples
provided no alternative cues for selecting the
grammatical version.
Thus, the success rate in R&amp;C’s experiment has
very limited applicability. In general, bigram
probability (or sentence cross-entropy, as
computed in these experiments) is a poor predictor
of grammaticality; e.g., the measure that prefers (1)
over (2) mis-prefers (8) over (9):

(8) *Scared you want to the doggie.
(9) She can hear what we’re saying.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950666666667">
We conclude that the bigram evidence against
the poverty of the stimulus for language
acquisition has not been substantiated to date. It
remains to be seen whether richer statistics-based
inductive models will offer more robust cross-
language learnability.
