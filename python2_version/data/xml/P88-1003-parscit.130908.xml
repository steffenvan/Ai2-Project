<bodyText confidence="0.999986769230769">
We present a computational treatment of the
semantics of plural Noun Phrases which extends an
earlier approach presented by Scha [7] to be able to
deal with multiple-level plurals (&amp;quot;the boys and the
girls&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the juries and the coMmittees&amp;quot;. etc.)&apos; We ar-
gue that the arbitrary depth to which such plural struc-
tures can be nested creates a correspondingly ar-
bitrary ambiguity in the possibilities for the distribution
of verbs over such NPs. We present a recursive
translation rule scheme which accounts for this am-
biguity, and in particular show how it allows for the
option of &amp;quot;partial distributivity&amp;quot; that collective verbs
have when applied to such plural Noun Phrases.

1 INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.959289642857143">
Syntactically parallel utterances which contain
plural noun phrases often require entirely different
semantic treatments depending upon the particular
verbs (or adjectives or prepositions) that these plural
NPs are combined with. For example, while the sen-
tence &apos;The boys walk&amp;quot; would have truth-conditions ex-
pressed by:2
V x e BOYS: WALK[x]
the very similar sentence &amp;quot;The boys gather&amp;quot; could not
be translated this way. Its truth-conditions would in-
stead have to be expressed by something like:
GATHER[BOYS]
since only a group can &amp;quot;gather&amp;quot;, not one person by
himself.
It is common to call a verb such as &amp;quot;walk&amp;quot; a
&amp;quot;distributive&amp;quot; verb, while a verb such as &amp;quot;gather&amp;quot; (or
&amp;quot;disperse&amp;quot; or intransitive &amp;quot;meet&amp;quot;) is called a

2We ignore hare the discourse issues that bear on the inter-
pretation of definite NPs
&amp;quot;collective&amp;quot; verb. The collective/distributive distinction
raises an important issue: how to treat the semantics
of plural NPs uniformly.
An earlier paper by Scha (&amp;quot;Distributive, Collective
and Cumulative Quantification&amp;quot; [7], hereinafter &amp;quot;DCC&amp;quot;)
presented a formal treatment of this issue which ex-
ploits an idea about the semantics of plural NP&apos;s
which is due to Bartsch [1]: plural NP&apos;s are always
interpreted as quantifying over sets rather than in-
dividuals; verbs are correspondingly always treated as
collective predicates applying to sets. Distributive
verbs are provided with meaning postulates which re-
late such collective applications to applications on the
constituent individuals.
The present paper describes an improved and ex-
tended version of this approach. Two important
problems are addressed. First, there is the problem
of ambiguity: the need to allow for more than one
distribution pattern for the same verb. Second, there
is the problem of &amp;quot;multi-level plurality&amp;quot;: the con-
sequences which arise for the distributive/collective
distinction when one considers conjoined plural NPs
such as &apos;The boys and the girls&amp;quot;.
Both issues are addressed by a two-level system
of semantic interpretation where the first level deals
with the semantic consequences of syntactic structure
and the second with the lexically specific details of
distribution.
The treatment of plural NPs described in this
paper has been implemented in the Spoken Lan-
guage System which is being developed at BBN. The
system provides a natural language interface to a
database/graphic display system which is used to ac-
cess information about the capabilities and readiness
conditions of the ships in the Pacific Fleet of the US
Navy.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows:
Section 2 discusses previous methods of handling
the distributive/collective distinction, and shows their
limitations in dealing with the problems mentioned
above.
Section 3 presents our two-level semantics ap-
proach. and shows how it handles the problem of am-
biguity.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999391">
2.1 An Approach to Distributivity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95766184375">
One possible way to generate the correct readings
for &amp;quot;The boys walk&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;The boys gather&amp;quot; is due to
Bennett [2]. Verbs are sub-categorized as either col-
lective or distributive. Noun phrases consisting of
&amp;quot;the&amp;quot; + plural then have two readings; a &amp;quot;set&amp;quot; reading
if they are combined with a collective verb and a
universal quantification reading if they are combined
with a distributive verb.
Scha&apos;s &amp;quot;Distributive, Collective, and Cumulative
Quantification&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;DCC&amp;quot;) showed that this approach,
while plausible for intransitive verbs, breaks down for
the two-argument case of transitive verbs [7]. Con-
sider the example below:
&amp;quot;The squares contain the circles&amp;quot;
F710 0
A
This sentence has a reading which can be ap-
proximately paraphrased as &amp;quot;Every circle is contained
in some square&amp;quot; so that in the world depicted above
the sentence would be considered true.
The truth-conditions which Bennett&apos;s approach
would predict, however, are expressed by the formula:
x e SQUARES: Vye CIRCLES: CONTAIN[x,y]
which obviously does not correspond to the state of
affairs pictured above.
&amp;quot;DCC&amp;quot; avoids this problem by not generating a
distributive translation directly. Noun phrases, regard-
less of number, quantify over sets of individuals: a
singular noun phrase simply quantifies over a
singleton set. Nouns by themselves denote sets of
such singleton sets. Thus, both &amp;quot;square&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;squares&amp;quot; are translated as:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.499625" genericHeader="method">
SQUARES&apos;
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9968145">
in which the asterisk operator — creates the set of
singleton subsets of &amp;quot;SQUARES&amp;quot;.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.745564">
Verbs can now be uniformly typed to accept sets

<bodyText confidence="0.999972555555556">
of individuals as their arguments. The
collective/distributive distinction consists solely in
whether a verb is applied to a large set or to a
singleton set.
Determiner translations are either distributive or
collective depending upon whether they apply the
predicate to .the constituent singletons or to their
union. Some determiners are unambiguously distribu-
tive, for example the translation for &amp;quot;each&amp;quot;:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.503699">
(A.X: ().P: V x e X: P(x)))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.924014">
Other determiners - &amp;quot;all&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;three&amp;quot; - are
ambiguous between translations which are distributive
and translations which are collective. Plural &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;, on
the other hand, is unambiguously collective, and has
the translation:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.633422" genericHeader="method">
(XX: (XP: P(U(X))))
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975360487179487">
where &amp;quot;U&amp;quot; takes a set of sets and delivers the set
which is their union.
The following is a list of sentences paired with
their translations under this scheme:
The boys walk
WALK(BOYS)
Each boy walks
Vx e BOYS&apos;: WALK()
The boys gather
GATHER(BOYS)
The squares contain the circles
CONTAIN(SQUARES.CIRCLES)
For &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; + plural NP&apos;s we thus obtain analyses which
are, though not incorrect, perhaps more vague than
one would desire. These analyses can be further
spelled out by providing distributive predicates, such
as &amp;quot;WALK&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;CONTAIN&amp;quot;, with meaning postulates
which control how that predicate is distributed over
the constituents of its argument. For example, the
meaning postulate associated with &amp;quot;WALK&amp;quot; could be:
WALK[x] [41(x) &gt;01 A [Vye x*: WALX[y]]
which, when applied to the above translation
&amp;quot;WALK[BOYS]&amp;quot;, gives the result:
[#(BOYS) &gt;0] A [Vy e BOYS*: WAWA]
which represents the desired distributive truth-
conditions.
The meaning postulate for &amp;quot;CONTAIN&amp;quot; could be:
CONTAIN[u, v] =&apos;y€ 3xe CONTAIN[zyj
This meaning postulate may be thought of as ex-
pressing a basic fact about the notion of containment:
namely that one composite object is &amp;quot;contained&amp;quot; by
another if every every part of the first is contained in
some part of the second. Application of this meaning
postulate to the translation
CONTAIN[SQUARES,CIRCLES]
gives the final result:
Vy e SQUARES&apos;: 3x e CIRCLES&apos;: CONTAIN[x,y]
which expresses the truth-conditions we originally

desired; namely those paraphrasable by &amp;quot;Every circle
is contained by some square&amp;quot;.
In general, it is expected that different verbs will
have different meaning postulates, corresponding to
the different facts and beliefs about the world that
pertain to them.

2.2 Problems
Conjunctive Noun Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982527882352941">
&amp;quot;DCC&amp;quot; only treated plural Noun Phrases (such as
&amp;quot;the boys&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;some girls&amp;quot;), but did not deal with
conjunctive Noun Phrases (&amp;quot;John, Peter and Bill&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the
boys and the girls&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;the committees and the
juries&amp;quot;). It is not immediately clear how a treatment of
them would be added. Note that a PTO-style3 treat-
ment of the NP &amp;quot;John and Peter&amp;quot;:
XP: P(John, ) A P(Peter )
would encounter serious difficulties with a sentence
like &amp;quot;John and Peter carried a piano upstairs&amp;quot;. Here it
would predict only the distributed reading, yet a col-
lective reading is the desired one.
It would be more in the spirit of the treatment in
&amp;quot;DCC&amp;quot; to combine the denotations of the NPs that are
conjoined by some form of union. For example, &amp;quot;John
and Peter&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The boys and the girls&amp;quot; might be trans-
lated as:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.875713" genericHeader="method">
A.P: P({John, ,Peter, })
XP. P(BOYS U GIRLS)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99980875">
For a sentence like &amp;quot;The boys and the girls gather
this prevents what we call the &amp;quot;partially&amp;quot; distributive&amp;quot;
reading - namely the reading in which the boys gather
in one place and the girls in another.
For this reason, it seems incorrect to assimilate all
NP denotations to the type of sets of individuals.
Noun phrases like &amp;quot;The boys and the girls&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The
juries and the committees&amp;quot;, are what we call &amp;quot;multi-
level plurals&amp;quot;: they have internal structure which can-
not be abolished by assimilation to a single set
Note that the plural NP &amp;quot;the committees&amp;quot; is a
multi-level plural as well, even though it is not a con-
junction. The sentence &amp;quot;The committees gather has
a partially distributive reading (each committe gathers
separately) analogous with the partially distributive
reading for &amp;quot;The boys and girls gather&amp;quot; above.

Ambiguity and Discourse Effects

The final problem for the treatment in &amp;quot;DCC&amp;quot; has
to do with the meaning postulates themselves. These
always dictate the same distribution pattern for any

verb, yet it does not seem plausible that one could
finally decide what this should be, since the beliefs
and knowledge about the world from which they are
derived are subject to variation from speaker to
speaker.
Variability in distribution might also be imposed by
context. Consider the sentence &amp;quot;The children ate the
pizzas&amp;quot; and a world depicted by the figure in 2.1
where the squares represent children, and the circles,
pizzas. Now there will be different quantificational
readings of the sentence. The question &amp;quot;What did the
children eat?&amp;quot; might be reasonably answered by &amp;quot;The
pizzas&amp;quot;. If one were to instead ask &amp;quot;Who ate the
pizzas?&amp;quot; (with a view, perhaps, to establishing in-
dividual guilt) the answer &amp;quot;The children&amp;quot; would not be
as felicitous, since the picture includes one square
(child) not containing anything.
It is to these problems with meaning postulates
that we now turn in Section 3. The solution presented
there is then used in Section 4, where we present our
solution to the NP-conjunction/multi-level plural
problem.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995523">
3.1 The Problem with Meaning Postulates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984749185185185">
That certain predicates may have different dis-
tributive expansions in different contexts cannot be
captured by meaning postulates: since meaning pos-
tulates are stipulated to be true in all models it is
logically incoherent to have several, mutually incom-
patible meaning postulates for the same constant&apos;s
An alternative might be to retreat from the notion
of meaning postulates per se, and view them instead
as some form of conventional implicatures which are
&amp;quot;usually&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;often&amp;quot; true. While it is impossible to have
alternative meaning postulates, it is easier to imagine
having alternative implicatures.
For a semantics which aspires to state specific
truth-conditions this is not a very attractive position.
We prefer to view these as alternative readings of the
sentence, stemming from an open-ended ambiguity of
the lexical items in question - an ambiguity which has
to do with the specific details of distributions.
Since this ambiguity is not one of syntactic type it
does not make sense (in either explanatory or com-
putational terms) to multiply lexical entries on its be-
half. Rather, one wants a level of representation in
which these distributional issues are left open, to be
resolved by a later stage of processing.
40ne might try to combine them into a single meaning postulate by
logical disjunction. We have indicated before (9) why this approach is
not satisfactory.

3.2 Two Levels of Semantic Interpretation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999822779661017">
To accommodate this our system employs two
stages of semantic interpretation, using a technique
for coping with lexical ambiguity which was originally
developed for the Question-Answering System
PHLIQA [3] [8]. The first stage uses a context-free
grammar with associated semantic rules to produce
an expression of the logical language EFL (for
English-Oriented Formal Language). EFL includes a
descriptive constant for each word in the lexicon,
however many senses that word may have. Hence
ER. is an ambiguous logical language; in technical
terms this means either that the language has a
model-theory that assigns multiple denotations to a
single expression [5], or that its expressions are
viewed as schemata which abbreviate sets of possible
instance-expressions. [9]
The second stage translates the ER. expression
into one or more expressions of WML (for World
Model Language). WML, while differing syntactically
from EFL only in its descriptive constants, is un-
ambiguous. and includes a descriptive constant for
each primitive concept of the application domain in
question. A set of translation rules relates each am-
biguous constant of EFL to a set of WML expressions
representing its possible meanings. Translation of
ER expressions to WML expressions is effected by
producing all possible combinations of constant sub-
stitutions and removing those which are &amp;quot;semantically
anomalous&amp;quot;, in a sense which we will shortly define.
ER. and WML are instantiations of a higher-order
logic with a recursive type system. In particular, if a
and 3 are types, then:
sets(a)
sets(sets(a))
sets(sets(sets(a)))
fun(a, 3)
fun(sets(a),3)
fun(sets(a),sets(3))
are all types. The type &amp;quot;sets(a)&amp;quot; is the type of sets
whose elements are of type a. The type &amp;quot;FUN(0413)&amp;quot;
is the type of functions from type a to type 13.
Every expression has a type. which is computed
from the type of its sub-expressions. Types have
domains which are sets; whatever denotation an ex-
pression can take on must be an element of the
domain of its type. Some expressions, being con-
structed from combinations of sub-expressions of in-
appropriate types, are not meaningful and are said to
be &amp;quot;semantically anomalous&amp;quot;. These are assigned a
special type, called NULL-SET, whose domain is the
empty set.
For example, if &amp;quot;F&amp;quot; is an expression of type
fun(a43) and &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; is an expression of type x whose
domain is disjoint from the domain of a, then the ex-
pression &amp;quot;F(a)&amp;quot; representing the application of &amp;quot;F&amp;quot; to
&amp;quot;a&amp;quot; is anomalous and has the type NULL-SET.
For more details on these formal languages and
their associated type system, see the paper by
Landsbergen and Scha (5].

3.3 Translation Rules Instead of Meaning
Postulates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998508">
We are now in a position to replace the meaning
postulates of the &amp;quot;DCC&amp;quot; system with their equivalent
ER. to WML translation rules. For example, the
original treatment of &amp;quot;contain&amp;quot; would now be
represented by the translation rule:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.410158">
CONTAIN .&gt;ku.v: V y e : 3x e u*: CONTAIN&apos; [x.yi
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.990633">
Note that the constant &amp;quot;CONTAIN&apos;&amp;quot; on the right-hand
side is a constant of WML. and is notationally
separated from its ER. counterpart by a prime-mark.
The device of translation rules can now be
brought to bear on the problem mentioned in section
22, namely the distributional ambiguity (in context) of
the transitive verb &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot;. The reading which allows an
exception in the first argument would be generated by
the translation rule:
EAT .&gt; v: V: 3x € u*: EAT&apos; [x,y]
while the reading which allows no such exception
would be:
EATu,v 4.[V&gt;x e 3y e it: EAT&apos; [y,x]] A
[V x e Lt: 3y e e: EAT&apos; [x,y]]
We call this a &amp;quot;leave none our translation. When
applied to the sentence &apos;The children ate the pizzas&amp;quot;
this generates the reading where all children are
guilty.
By using this device of translation rules a verb
may be provided with any desired (finite) number of
alternative distribution patterns.
The next section, which presents this paper&apos;s
treatment of the multiple plurals problem, will make
use of a slight modification of the foregoing in which
the translation rules are allowed to contain EFL con-
stants on their right-hand sides as well as their left,
thus making the process recursive.

4 MULTIPLE LEVELS OF PLURALITY
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.884438">
4.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997858">
As we have seen in Section 2.2, utterances which
contain multi-level plurals sometimes give rise to
mixed collective/distributive readings which cannot be
accounted for without retaining the separate semantic
identity of the constituents.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.973735">

<bodyText confidence="0.999976736842105">
Consider, for instance, the sentence &amp;quot;The juries
and the committees gather&amp;quot;. This has three readings:
one in which each of the juries gathers alone and
each of the committees gathers alone as well
(distribution over two levels), another in which all per-
sons who are committee members gather in one
place and all persons who are jurors gather in another
place (distributiorr over one level), and finally a third in
which all jurors and committee members unite in one
large convention (completely collective). It seems in-
escapable, therefore, that the internal multi-level
structure of NPs has to be preserved.
Indeed, it can be argued that the number of levels
necessary is not two or three but arbitrary. As
Landman [4] has pointed out, conjunctions can be ar-
bitrarily nested (consider all the groupings that are
possible in the NP &amp;quot;Bob and Carol and Ted and
Alice&amp;quot;!). Therefore, the sets which represent collec-
tive entities must, in principle, be allowed to be of
arbitrary complexity. This is the view we adopt.
Allowing arbitrary complexity in the structure of
collective entities creates a problem for specifying the
distributive interpretations of collective predicates:
they can no longer be enumerated by finite lists of
translation rules. An arbitrary number of levels of
structure means an arbitrary number of ways to dis-
tribute, and these cannot be finitely enumerated.
In order to handle these issues it is necessary to
extend the ambiguity treatment of the previous sub-
section so that, as is advocated in [9], it recursively
enumerates this infinite set of alternatives. In order to
do this we must allow EFL constants to also appear
on the right-hand side of translation rules as well as
on the left.
In the next sub-section we present such a recur-
sive EFL constant. Its role in the system is to deal
with distributions over arbitrarily complex plural struc-
tures.

4.2 The PARTS Function
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99369335">
For any complex structure there is generally more
than one way to decompose it into parts. For ex-
ample, the structure
( {John,Peter,Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy} }
can be viewed as either having two parts - the sets
Vohn,Peter.Billy and IMary,Jane,Lucyy - or six - the
six people John,Peter,Bill.Mary,Jane, and Lucy.
These multiple perspectives on a complex entity
are accommodated in our system by the EFL function
PARTS. This function takes a term, simple or com-
plex, and returns the set of &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot; (that is, mathemati-
cal &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot;) making it up. Because there is in general
more than one way to decompose a composite entitity
into parts, this is an ambiguous term which can be
expanded in more than one way. In addition, because
the set-theoretic structures corresponding to plural en-
tities can be arbitrarily complex, some expansions
must be recursive, containing PARTS itself on the
right-hand side.
The expansions of PARTS are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998335666666667">
1. PARTS[x] =&gt; x (where x an individual)
2. PARTS[s] =&gt; (for: s, collect: PARTS)
(where s a set)
3. PARTS[s] so&gt; U(for: s. collect: PARTS)
(where s a set)
4. PARTS[x] mi&gt; F[x]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9802538">
Rule (1) asserts that any atomic entity is indivisible,
that is. is its own sole part (remember, we are talking
about mathematical, not physical parts here). Rules
(2) and (3) range over sets and collect together the
set of values of PARTS for each member; rule (3)
differs in that it merges these into a single set with the
operator &apos;U&apos;. &apos;U&apos; takes a set of sets and returns their
union. In rule (4) &amp;quot;F&amp;quot; is a descriptive function. This
rule is included to handle notions like membership of
a committee, etc.
Suppose PARTS is applied to the structure:
( (John,Peter,Bill),{Mary,Jane,Lucy} }
corresponding, perhaps, to the denotation of the NP
&amp;quot;The boys and the girls&amp;quot;. The alternative sets of parts
of this structure are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982527">
(1) {John,Peter,Bill,Mary,Jane,Lucy}
(2) ( (John,Peter,Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy} }
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.947012095238095">
Let us see how these are produced by recursively
expanding the function PARTS. Suppose we invoke
rule (3) to begin with. This produces:
U(for: ( (John,Peter,Bill},(Mary,Jane,Lucy) },
collect: PARTS)
Now suppose we invoke rule (2) on this, resulting in:
U(for: ( (John,Peter,Bill),(Mary,Jane,Lucy) ),
collect: kr. (for: x, collect: PARTS))
In the final step, we invoke rule (1) to produce:
U(for:( {John,Peter.Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy} }
collect: Xx: (for: x,
collect: Xx: x)
This expression simplifies to:
(John,Peter,Bill,Mary,Jane,Lucy)
which is just the expansion (1) above.
Now suppose we had invoked rule (2) to start
with, instead of rule (3). This would produce the ex-
pansion:
for: ( {John,Peter,Bill},{Mary,Jane,Lucy} },
collect: PARTS

This expression reduces by logical equivalence to:
( {John,Peter,Bill),(Mary,Jane,Lucy)
which is just the expansion (2).
We now proceed to the distributing translation
rules for verbs, which make use of the PARTS func-
tion in order to account for the multiple distributional
readings economically.

4.3 The Distributing Translation Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964">
The form below is an example of the new scheme
for the translation rules, a translation which can cope
with the problem originally posed in section 2.1, &amp;quot;The
squares contain the circles&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.900449333333333">
CONTAIN .&gt;
ku,v : x e PARTS((]:
3y e PARTS[{01: CONTAIN&apos; [y,x1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.914198">
This revised system can now cope with Multi-level
plural arguments to the verb &amp;quot;contain&amp;quot;. Suppose we
are given &amp;quot;The squares contain the circles and
triangles&amp;quot;. The initial translation is then:
Vx e PARTSR{CIRCLES,TRIANGLES})]:
3y e PARTS[(SQUARESI]:
CONTAIN&apos; ly.4
The ranges of the quantifiers each contain an occur-
rence of the PARTS function, so it is ambiguous as to
what they quantify over. Note, however, that the
WML predicate CONTAIN, is typed as being ap-
plicable to individuals only. Inappropriate expansions
for the quantifier ranges therefore result in anomalous
expressions which the translation algorithm filters out
The first range restriction:
PARTSMCIRCLES,TRIANGLES)}]
is expanded to:
U(for: ({CIRCLES.TRIANGLES}),
collect: kx: U(for: x,
collect: Aar (for: x, collect: xx. 4))
by a sequence of expansion rule applications
(3),(3),(2),(2), and (1). This final form is equivalent to:
Note one other modification with respect to the treatment
presented in section 11: predicates translating verbs are now al-
lowed to operate on individuals instead of sets only
U(CIRCLES,TRIANGLES)
The other restriction, &apos;PARTS[{SQUARES}]&apos;, is
reduced by similar means to just &apos;SQUARES&apos;. We
have, finally:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.488243">
Vx E U(CIRCLES,TRIANGLES):

4.4 Partial Distribution of Collective Verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979903720930232">
Let us take up again the example &apos;The juries and
committees gather. Recall that this has three read-
ings: one in which each deliberative body gathers
apart, another in which the various jurors combine in a
gathering and the various committee members com-
bine separately in another gather, and finally, one in
which all persons concerned, be they jurors or com-
mittee members, come together to form a single
gathering.
These readings are accounted for by the following
translation rule for GATHER:
GATHER A.x: V y e PARTS({x}]: GATHER&apos; Cyj
Applying this rule to the initial translation:
GATHER[{{JURIES,COMMITTEES}}J
produces the expression:
Vy e PARTSWJURIES,COMMITTEESDI:
GATHER&apos; (y)
The various readings of this now depend upon what
the range of quantification is expanded to. This must
be a set of sets of persons in order to fit the type of
GATHER&apos; ,which is a predicate on sets of persons.
We will now show how the PARTS function
derives the decompositions that allow each of these
readings. Because of the collective nature of the
terms &amp;quot;jury&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;committee&amp;quot; we will use rule (4),
which uses an arbitrary descriptive function to decom-
pose an element.
Suppose that &apos;JURIES&apos; has the extension &apos;{j1,j2,j3}&apos;
and &apos;COMMITTEES&apos; has the extension ,c2,c3y.
Suppose also that the the descriptive function
&apos;MEMBERS-OF&apos; is available, taking an organization
such as a jury or committee onto the set of people
who are its members. Let it have an extension cor-
responding to:
Ii fa,b,c)
2&apos; (d.e,f)
(g,h,i)
c1 {j,k,1}
02 {m,n,o}
c3 --+ (p,q,r)
where the letters a,b,c, etc. represent persons.
The derivation (3),(3),(2),(4) yields the first of the
readings above, in which the verb is partially dis-

tributed over two levels. The range of quantification
has the extension:
( {a,b,c},{d,e.f),(g.h,i),(j,k,1),{m ,n,o},{p,q,r} )
This is the reading in which each jury and committee
gathers by itself.
The derivation (3),(2),(3),(4) yields the second
reading, in which the verb is partially distributed over
the outer level. The derivation produces a range of
quantification whose extension is:
( (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i),(j,k,l,m,n.o.p,q,r)
This is the reading in which the jurors gather in one
place and the committee members in another.
Finally, the derivation (2),(3),(3),(4) yields the third
reading, which is completely collective. This deriva-
tion produces a range of quantification whose exten-
sion is:
( (a,b,c,d,e.f.g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r)
This is the reading in which all persons who are either
jurors or committee members gather.

5 OTHER PARTS OF SPEECH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999275">
In this section we discuss distributional considera-
tions for argument-taking parts of speech other than
verbs - specifically prepositions and adjectives.
Prepositions in our system are translated as two-place
predicates, adjectives as one-place predicates. The
distributional issues they raise are therefore treatable
by the same machinery we have developed for tran-
sitive and intransitive verbs.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.974456">
5.1 Prepositions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97899375">
Prepositions are subject to distributional con-
siderations that are analogous to those of transitive
verbs. Consider:
The books are on the shelves
Given facts about physical objects and spatial loca-
tion, the most plausible meaning for this sentence is
that every book is on some shelf or other. This would
be expressed by the translation rule:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.494554">
Xu,v : Vxe PARTS(u): 3ye PARTS(v): ON (x,y)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959">
Note the similarity with the translation rule for
&amp;quot;CONTAIN&amp;quot;, from which it differs in that the roles of
the first and the second argument in the quantifica-
tional structure are reversed.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991989">
5.2 Adjectives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9888385">
The treatment of adjectives in regular form is ex-
actly analogous with that given intransitive verbs such
as &amp;quot;walk&amp;quot;. Thus, for the adjective &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, we may have
the translation rule:
RED &gt;u:X V xe PARTS(u): RED(x)
A more interesting problem is seen in sentences con-
taining the comparative form of an adjective, as in:
The frigates are faster than the carriers
What are the truth-conditions of this sentence? One
might construe it to mean that every frigate is faster
than every carrier, but this seems unneccesarily
strong. Intuitively, it seems to mean something a little
weaker than that, allowing perhaps for a few excep-
tions in which a particular carrier is not faster than a
particular frigate.
On the other hand, another requirement
eliminates truth-conditions which are too weak. For if
&amp;quot;The frigates are faster than the carriers&amp;quot; is true, it
must surely be the case that &amp;quot;The carriers are faster
than the frigates&amp;quot; is false. This requirement holds not
only for &amp;quot;faster&amp;quot;, but for the comparative form of any
adjective.
The treatment of comparative forms in the Spoken
Language System can be illustrated by the following
schema:
(kx,y: larger(&lt;uf&gt;(x),&lt;uf&gt;(y)))
in which &apos;&lt;uf&gt;&apos; is filled in by an &amp;quot;underlying function&amp;quot;
particular to the adjective in question. For the adjec-
tive &amp;quot;fast&amp;quot;, this underlying function is &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot;.
The requirement of anti-symmetry for the distribu-
tions of comparatives is now reduced to a requirement
of anti-symmetry for the distributional translation of
the EFL constant &amp;quot;larger&amp;quot;. In this way, the anti-
symmetry requirement is expressed for all compara-
tives at once.
Obviously anti-symmetry is fufilled for the
universal-universal translation, but, as we have
pointed out, this is a very strong condition. There is
another, weaker condition which fufills anti-symmetry:
larger, .&gt;
Xu,v: Vx PARTS[u]:3y e PARTS(: larger&apos; [x.y] A
Vx e PARTS[: 3y e PARTS(u): larger&apos; [y,x]
When applied to the sentence above, this condition
simply states that for every frigate there exists a car-
rier that is slower than it. and conversely, for every
carrier there exists a frigate that is faster than it.
This is anti-symmetric as required. For if there is
some frigate that is faster than every carrier, there
cannot be some carrier that is faster than every
frigate.

6 THE ALGORITHM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952">
The algorithm which applies this method is an ex-
tension of the previously-mentioned procedure of
generating all possible WML expansions from an ER_
expression and weeding out semantically anomalous
ones. The two steps of generate and test are now
embedded in a loop that simply iterates until all EFL-
level constants, including &apos;PARTS&apos;, are expanded
</bodyText>

away. This gives us a breadth-first search of the
possible recursive expansions of TARTS&apos;, one which
nevertheless does not fail to halt because seman-
tically anomalous versions, such as those attempting
to quantify over expressions which are not sets, or
those applying descriptive relations to arguments of
the wrong type, are weeded out and are not pursued
any further in the next iteration.
We can now define the function TO-WML, which
takes an EFL expression and produces a set of WML
expressions without EFL constants. It is:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.50077" genericHeader="method">
TO-WML(exp) mde

<reference confidence="0.8835759">
expansions &lt;- (exp)

do
begin
expansions &lt;- U(for: expansions,
collect: Xe for: AMBIG-TRANS(e)
collect: SIMPLIFY)
expansions &lt;- {e e expansions: TYPEOF(e)*
NULL-SET}
end
</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.999773857142857">
The function AMBIG-TRANS expands the EFL-level
constants in its input, and returns a set of expres-
sions. The function EFL? returns true if any ER_
constants are present in its argument. The function
TYPEOF takes an expression and returns its type; it
returns the symbol NULL-SET if the expression is
semantically anomalous. Note that if a particular ex-
pansion is found to be semantically anomalous it is
removed from consideration. If no non-anomalous
expansion can be found the procedure halts and the
empty set of expansions is returned.. In this case
the entire EFL expression is viewed as anomalous
and the interpretation which gave rise to it can be
rejected.

7 CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993722222222">
We have shown how treatments of the
collective/distributive distinction must take into ac-
count the phenomenon of &amp;quot;partial distributivity&amp;quot;, in
which a collective verb optionally distributes over the
outer levels of structure in what we call a &amp;quot;multi-level&amp;quot;
plural. Multiple levels of structure must be allowed in
the semantics of such plural NPs as &amp;quot;the boys and the
girls&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the committees&amp;quot;, etc.
We have presented a computational mechanism
which accounts for these phenomena through a
framework of recursive translation rules. This
framework generates quantifications over alternative
levels of plural structure in an NP, and can handle
NPs of arbitrarily complex plural structure. It is
economical in its means of producing arbitrary num-
bers of readings: the multiple readings of the sen-
tence such as &apos;The juries and the committees
gathered&amp;quot; are expressed with just one translation rule.
