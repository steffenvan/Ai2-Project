This paper describes collaborative work
on developing Indonesian WordNet in
the AsianWordNet (AWN). We will de-
scribe the method to develop for colla-
borative editing to review and complete
the translation of synset. This paper aims
to create linkage among Asian languages
by adopting the concept of semantic re-
lations and synset expressed in Word-
Net.

Multilingual lexicons is of foremost importance
for intercultural collaboration to take place, as
multilingual lexicons are several multilingual
application such as Machine Translation,
terminology, multilingual computing.
WordNet is the resource used to identify shallow
semantic features that can be attached to lexical
units. The original WordNet is English WordNet
proposed and developed at Princeton University
WordNet (PWN) by using bilingual dictionary.
In the era of globalization, communication
among languages becomes much more
important. People has been hoping that natural
language processing and speech processing. We
can assist in smoothening the communication
among people with different languages.
However, especially for Indonesian language,
there were only few researches in the past.
The Princeton WordNet is one of the semantical-
ly English lexical banks containing semantic
relationships between words. Concept mapping
is a process of organizing to forming meaningful
relationships between them.
The goal of Indonesian AWN database man-
agement system is to share a multilingual lexical
database of Indonesian language which are
structured along the same lines as the AWN.
AWN is the result of the collaborative effort in
creating an interconnected Wordnet for Asian
languages. AWN provides a free and public plat-
form for building and sharing among AWN. The
distributed database system and user-friendly
tools have been developed for user. AWN is
easy to build and share.
This paper describes manual interpretation me-
thod of Indonesian for AWN. Based on web ser-
vices architecture focusing on the particular
cross-lingual distributed. We use collective in-
telligence approach to build this English equiva-
lent. In this sequel, in section 2 the collabora-
tions builders works on web interface at
www.asianwordnet.org. In section 3, Interpretation
of Indonesian AWN, short description of
progress of English — Indonesian translation and
the obstacle of translation.

WordNet covers the vast majority of nouns,
verbs, adjectives and adverbs from English lan-
guage. The words are organized in synonym sets
called synset. Each synset represents a concept
includes an impressive number of semantic rela-
tions defined across concepts.
The information encoded in WordNet is used in
several stages in the parsing process. For in-
stance, attribute relations, adjective1adverb clas-
sifications, and others are semantic features ex-
tracted from WordNet and stored together with
the words, so that they can be directly used by
the semantic parser.

To build language WordNet there are two main
of discussion; the merge approach and the ex-
pand approach. The merge approach is to build
the taxonomies of the language (synset) using
English equivalent words from bilingual dictio-
naries. The expand approach is to map translate
local words the bilingual dictionaries. This ap-
proach show the relation between senses. The
system manages the synset assignment accord-
ing to the preferred score obtained from the revi-
sion process. For the result, the community will
be accomplish into original form of WordNet
database. The synset can generate a cross lan-
guage result.
AWN also introduce a web-based collaborative
workbench, for revising the result of synset as-
signment and provide a framework to create
AWN via linkage through PWN synset. AWN
enables to connect and collaborate among indi-
vidual intelligence in order accomplish a text
files.
At present, there are ten Asian language in the
community. The amount of the translated syn-
sets had been increased. Many language have
collaboration in AWN.

3 Interpretation of Indonesian AWN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999840055555556">
Indonesian WordNet have been used as a gener-
al-purpose translation. Our approach was to
generate the query for the web services engine in
English and then to translate every key element
of the query (topic, focus, keywords) into Indo-
nesian without modifying the query. The dictio-
nary is distinguished by set of entry word cha-
racteristic, clear definitions, its guidance on
usage. All dictionary information for entries is
structured such as entry word, multiple word
entries, notes, contemporary definitions, deriva-
tions, example sentence, idioms, etc. All dictio-
nary are implemented as text-files and as lin-
guistic databases connected to Indonesian AWN.
The set of language tags consists of part of
speech, case, gender, number, tense, person,
voice, aspect, mood, form, type, reflexive, ani-
mation.

AsianWordNet to create web services among
Asia languages based on Princeton WordNet®
version 3.0, Co-operation by TCL and BPPT
establish on October 2007.
As presented above, we follow the merge to
create and share the Indonesian WordNet by
translating the each synonym translation. We
expand an appropriate synset to a lexical entry
by considering its English equivalent.
We plan to have reliable process to create and
share Indonesian WordNet in AWN. We classify
this work into four person AWN translators to
participate in the project of Indonesian AWN.

are based on categories from PWN. There is on-

3.2 Obstacle of Indonesian Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985590452830189">
Wordnet has unique meaning of word which is
presented in synonym set. Each synset has glos-
sary which defines concept its representation.
For examples word car, auto, automobile, and
motorcar has one synset.
An automatic compilation of dictionary in AWN
have a translational issues. There are many cases
in explanation sense. One word in English will
be translated into a lot of Indonesian words,
glossary can be express more than one Indone-
sian word (Ex. 1).
One of the main obstacles in studying the ab-
sorption of English words in Indonesian words,
is the fact that the original form of some words
that have been removed due to Indonesian
reform process, in which some words have been
through an artificial process. There is no special
character in Indonesian word, especially in tech-
nical word, so that means essentially the same as
the English word (Ex. 2).
Ex. 1. time frame
POS noun time
synset time�frame
gloss a time period
during which
something
occurs or is
expected to occur;
an agreement can
be reached in
a reasonably
short time frame&amp;quot;
Indonesian jangka waktu,
selang waktu
Ex. 2. resolution
POS noun phenomenon
synset resolution
gloss (computer science)
the number
of pixels per
square inch on
a computer
generated display;
the greater
the resolution, the
better the picture
Indonesian resolusi
Using definitions from the WordNet electronic
lexical database. A major problem in natural
language processing is that of lexical ambiguity,
be it syntactic. Each single words must be con-
tainer for some part of the linguistic knowledge
need to ambiguous wordnet sense. Therefore,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998188">

<bodyText confidence="0.969490333333333">
not only a single heuristic translate Indonesian
words. The WordNet defined in some semantic
relations, this categories using lexicographer file
and glossary definitions relations are assigned to
weight in the range. WordNet hierarchy for the
first sense of the word &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; there are 10
synset words (I take three of ten) that are related
to the meaning are the following in ( Ex. 3.)
Three concepts recur in WordNet literature that
entail a certain amount of ambiguity : termino-
logical distance, semantic distance and concep-
tual distance. Terminological distance, by con-
trast, often appears to refer to the suitability of
the word selected to express a given concept.
Semantic distance is understood to mean the
contextual factor of precision in meaning. And
the conceptual distance between words, in which
have relations proved.
Ex. 3. empty
POS noun art
synset empty
gloss a container that
has been
emptied; &amp;quot;return
all empties to
the store&amp;quot;
Indonesian hampa
empty
POS verb change
synset empty, discharge
gloss become empty or
void of its
content; &amp;quot;The
room emptied&amp;quot;
Indonesian mengosongkan
empty
POS adjectives all
synset empty
gloss emptied of emotion;
&amp;quot;after the violent
argument he felt
empty&amp;quot;
Indonesian kosong, penat
Disambiguation is unquestionably the most ab-
undant and varied application. It precision and
relevance in response to a query inconsisten-
cies. Schematically the semantic disambiguation
are selected in the glossaries of each noun, verb,
and adjectives and its subordinates.
WordNet information, whose objective is to
build designs for the association between sen-
tences and coherence relations as well as to find
lexical characteristics in coherence categories.
WordNet became an ancillary tool for semantic
ontology design geared to high quality informa-
tion extraction from the web services.
A comparative analysis of trends in wordnet use
:
1. Support for the design of grammatical
categories designed to classify
information by aspects and traits, but in
particular to design and classify
semantic ontologies.
2. Basis for the development of audio-
visual and multi-media information
retrieval systems.

Any multilingual process such as cross-lingual
information must involve resources and lan-
guage pair. Language specific can be applied in
parallel to achieve best result.
