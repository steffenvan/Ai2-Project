<bodyText confidence="0.999959821428572">
This document describes the methods and re-
sults for our participation in the BioNLP’09
Shared Task #1 on Event Extraction. It also
contains some error analysis and a brief dis-
cussion of the results. Previous shared tasks in
the BioNLP community have focused on ex-
tracting gene and protein names, and on find-
ing (direct) protein-protein interactions (PPI).
This year’s task was slightly different, since
the protein names were already manually an-
notated in the text. The new challenge was
to extract biological events involving these
given gene and gene products. We modi-
fied a publicly available system (AkanePPI)
to apply it to this new, but similar, protein
interaction task. AkanePPI has previously
achieved state-of-the-art performance on all
existing public PPI corpora, and only small
changes were needed to achieve competitive
results on this event extraction task. Our of-
ficial result was an F-score of 36.9%, which
was ranked as number six among submissions
from 24 different groups. We later balanced
the recall/precision by including more predic-
tions than just the most confident one in am-
biguous cases, and this raised the F-score on
the test-set to 42.6%. The new Akane program
can be used freely for academic purposes.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897833333333">
With the increasing number of publications report-
ing on protein interactions, there is also a steadily
increasing interest in extracting information from
Biomedical articles by using Natural Language Pro-
cessing (BioNLP). There has been several shared
tasks arranged by the BioNLP community to com-
pare different ways of doing such Information Ex-
traction (IE), as reviewed in Krallinger et al.(2008).
Earlier shared tasks have dealt with Protein-
Protein Interaction (PPI) in general, but this
task focuses on more specific molecular events,
such as Gene expression, Transcription, Pro-
tein catabolism, Localization and Binding, plus
(Positive or Negative) Regulation of proteins or
other events. Most of these events are related to PPI,
so our hypothesis was that one of the best perform-
ing PPI systems would perform well also on this
new event extraction task. We decided to modify a
publicly available system with flexible configuration
scripting (Miwa et al., 2008). Some adjustments had
to be made to the existing system, like adding new
types of Named Entities (NE) to represent the events
mentioned above. The modified AkaneRE (for Re-
lation Extraction) can be freely used in academia1.

The text was split into single sentences by a sim-
ple sentence detection program, and then each sen-
tence was split into words (tokens). The tokeniza-
tion was done by using white-space as the token-
separator, but since all protein names are known dur-
ing both training and testing, some extra tokeniza-
tion rules were applied. For example, the protein

Event clue-word detection was performed by a Ma-
chine Learning (ML) sequence labeling program.
This named-entity tagger program is based on a first
order Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM)
and is described in Yoshida and Tsujii (2007). The
clue-word annotation of the shared-task training set

MEMM model. The features used in the MEMM
model was extracted from surface strings and POS
information of the words corresponding to (or ad-
jacent to) the target BIO tags. The clue-word tag-
ger was applied to the development and test sets to
obtain the marginal probability that each word is a
clue-word of a certain category. The probabilities
were obtained by marginalizing the n-best output of
the MEMM tagger. We later also created clue-word
probability annotation of the training set, to enable
the template extraction program to access clue-word
probability information in the training phase.

2.4 Event Template Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996224058823529">
The training data was used to determine which
events to extract. As input to the system, a list of
Named Entity (NE) types and the Roles they can
play were provided. The roles can be thought of as
slots for arguments in event-frames, and in this task
the roles were Event (clue), Theme and Cause. In
the original AkanePPI (based on the AIMed corpus),
the only NE type was Protein, and the only role was
Theme (p1 and p2). All the (PPI) events were pair-
wise interactions, and there was no explicit event-
clue role. This means that all the events could be
represented with the single template shown first in
Table 1.
The BioNLP shared task used eight other NE
types, in addition to manually annotated Proteins,
namely Binding, Gene expression, Localization,
Protein catabolism, Transcription, Regulation, Pos-
itive Regulation and Negative Regulation. The first
five events have only Theme slots, which can only
be filled by Proteins, while the last three regulation
events are very diverse. They also have one Theme
slot, but they can have a Cause slot as well, and each
role/slot can be filled with either Proteins, or other
Events. See the first half of Table 1.
148 templates were extracted and clustered into
nine homogeneous groups which were classified
as nine separate sub-problems. The grouping was
based on whether the templates had an Event or a
Protein in the same role-positions. This way of orga-
nizing the groups was motivated by the fact that the
Proteins are 100% certain, while the accuracy of the
clue-word recognizer is only around 50% (estimated
on the training data). The bottom of Table 1 shows
the resulting nine general interaction templates.

2.5 Machine Learning with Maximum Entropy
Models
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.980406242424242">
We integrated Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling,
also known as Logistic Regression, into AkaneRE.
This was done by using LIBLINEAR4, which han-
dles multi-class learning and prediction. Gold tem-
plates were extracted during training, and each tem-
plate was matched with all legal combinations of
Named Entities (including gold proteins/clue-words
and other recognized clue-word candidates) in each
sentence. The positive training examples were la-
beled as gold members of the template, and all other
combinations matching a given template were la-
beled as negative examples within that specific tem-
plate class. The templates were grouped into the
nine general templates shown in the bottom of Ta-
ble 1. Using one-vs-rest logistic regression, we
trained one multi-class classifier for each of the nine
groups individually. The ML features are shown in
Table 2.
In the test-phase, we extracted and labeled all re-
lation candidates matching all the templates from the
training-phase. The ML component was automati-
cally run independently for each of the nine groups
listed in the bottom of Table 1. Each time, all the
candidate template-instances in the current group
were assigned a confidence score by the classifier for
that group. This score is the probability that a can-
didate is a true relation, and a value above a certain
threshold means that the extracted relation will be
predicted as a true member of its specific template.
LIBLINEAR’s C-value parameter and the prediction
threshold were selected by hand to produce a good
F-score (according to the strict matching criterion)
on the development-test set.

After machine learning, all the template instances
were filtered based on their confidence score. Af-
ter tuning the threshold to the development test-set,
we ended up using 1 as our C-value, and 3.5% as
our confidence threshold. Because the prediction
of Regulation Events were done independent from
the sub-events (or proteins) affected by that event,
some sub-events had to be included for complete-

3 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998632">
Our final official result was an F-score of 36.9%,
which was ranked as number six among the sub-
missions from 24 different groups. This means that
the AkanePPI system can achieve good results when
used on other PPI-related relation-extraction tasks,
such as this first BioNLP event recognition shared
task. The most common error was in predicting reg-
ulation events with other events as Theme or Cause.
The problem is that these events involve more than
one occurrence of event-trigger words, so the perfor-
mance is more negatively affected by our imperfect
clue-word detection system.
Since the recall was much lower on the test-set
than on the development test-set, we later allowed
the system to predict multiple confident alternatives
for a single event-word, and this raised our score on
the test-set from 36.9% to 42.6%. In hindsight, this
is obvious since there are many such examples in
the training data: E.g. “over-express” is both posi-
tive regulation and Gene expression. The new sys-
tem, named AkaneRE (for Relation Extraction), can
be used freely for academic purposes.
As future work, we believe a closer integration
between the clue-word recognition and the template
prediction modules can lead to better performance.
