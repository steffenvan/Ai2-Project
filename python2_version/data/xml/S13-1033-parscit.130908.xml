This paper presents three methods to evaluate
the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS). The
first two methods do not require labeled train-
ing data; instead, they automatically extract
semantic knowledge in the form of word asso-
ciations from a given reference corpus. Two
kinds of word associations are considered: co-
occurrence statistics and the similarity of
word contexts. The third method was done in
collaboration with groups from the Universi-
ties of Paris 13, Matanzas and Alicante. It
uses several word similarity measures as fea-
tures in order to construct an accurate predic-
tion model for the STS.

<bodyText confidence="0.999901888888889">
Even with the current progress of the natural lan-
guage processing, evaluating the semantic text
similarity is an extremely challenging task. Due to
the existence of multiple semantic relations among
words, the measuring of text similarity is a multi-
factorial and highly complex task (Turney, 2006).
Despite the difficulty of this task, it remains as
one of the most attractive research topics for the
NLP community. This is because the evaluation of
text similarity is commonly used as an internal
module in many different tasks, such as, informa-
tion retrieval, question answering, document sum-
marization, etc. (Resnik, 1999). Moreover, most of
these tasks require determining the “semantic”
similarity of texts showing stylistic differences or
using polysemicwords (Hliaoutakis et al., 2006).
The most popular approach to evaluate the se-
mantic similarity of words and texts consists in

using the semantic knowledge expressed in ontolo-
gies (Resnik, 1999); commonly, WorldNet is used
for this purpose (Fellbaum, 2005). Unfortunately,
despite the great effort that has been the creation of
WordNet, it is still far to cover all existing words
and senses (Curran, 2003).Therefore, the semantic
similarity methods that use this resource tend to
reduce their applicability to a restricted domain
and to a specific language.
We recognize the necessity of having and using
manually-constructed semantic-knowledge sources
in order to get precise assessments of the semantic
similarity of texts, but, in turn, we also consider
that it is possible to obtain good estimations of
these similarities using less-expensive, and perhaps
broader, information sources. In particular our
proposal is to automatically extract the semantic
knowledge from large amounts of raw data sam-
ples i.e. document corpora without labels.
In this paper we describe two different strategies
to compute the semantic similarity of words from a
reference corpus. The first strategy uses word co-
occurrence statistics. It determines that two words
are associated (in meaning) if they tend to be used
together, in the same documents or contexts. The
second strategy measures the similarity of words
by taking into consideration second order word co-
occurrences. It defines two words as associated if
they are used in similar contexts (i.e., if they co-
occur with similar words). The following section
describes the implementation of these two strate-
gies for our participation at the STS-SEM 2013
task, as well as their combination with the meas-
ures designed by the groups from the Universities
of Matanzas, Alicante and Paris 13.

The Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task con-
sists of estimated the value of semantic similarity
between two texts,D1 and D2 for now on.
As we mentioned previously, our participation in
the STS task of SEM 2013 considered two differ-
ent approaches that aimed to take advantage of the
language knowledge latent in a given reference
corpus. By applying simple statistics we obtained a
semantic similarity measure between words, and
then we used this semantic word similarity (SWS)
to get a sentence level similarity estimation. We
explored two alternatives for measuring the seman-
tic similarity of words, the first one, called
SWSo��,.,. , uses the co-occurrence of words in a
limited context1,and the second, SWScontext , com-
pares the contexts of the words using the vector
model and cosine similarity to achieve this com-
parison. It is important to point out that using the
vector space model directly, without any spatial
transformation as those used by other approaches2,
we could get greater control in the selection of the
features used for the extraction of knowledge from
the corpus. It is also worth mentioning that we
applied a stemming procedure to the sentences to
be compared as well as to all documents from the
reference corpus. We represented the texts D1 and
D2 by bags of tokens, which means that our ap-
proaches did not take into account the word order.
Following we present our baseline method, then,
we introduce the two proposed methods as well as
a method done in collaboration with other groups.
The idea of this shared-method is to enhance the
estimation of the semantic textual similarity by
combining different and diverse strategies for
computing word similarities.

<bodyText confidence="0.9994925">
This measure is based on a direct matching of to-
kens. It simply counts the number of tokens from
one text Di that also exist in the other text Dj . Be-
cause STS is a symmetrical attribute, unlike Tex-
tual Entailment (Agirre et al., 2012), we designed
it as a symmetric measure. We assumed that the
relationship between both texts is at least equal to
their smaller asymmetric similarity.

2.2 The proposed STS methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995352941176">
These methods incorporate semantic knowledge
extracted from a reference corpus. They aim to
take advantage of the latent semantic knowledge
from a large document collection. Because the
extracted knowledge from the reference corpus is
at word level, these methods for STS use the same
basic –word matching– strategy for comparing the
sentences like the baseline method. Nevertheless,
they allow a soft matching between words by in-
corporating information about their semantic simi-
larity.
The following formula shows the proposed
modification to the SIM function in order to incor-
porate information of the semantic word similarity
(SWS). This modification allowed us not only to
match words with exactly the same stem but also
to link different but semantically related words.

𝑆𝑊𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 is based on the idea that two terms are
semantically closer if they tend to be used in simi-
lar contexts. This measure uses the well-known
vector space model and cosine similarity to com-
pare the terms’ contexts. In a first step, we created
a context vector for each term, which captures all
the terms that appear around it in the whole refer-
ence corpus. Then, we computed the semantic
similarity of two terms by the following formula.

𝑡𝑖= 𝑡𝑗 1

where the cosine similarity, SIMCOS, is calcu-
lated on the vectors 𝑇 𝑖 and 𝑇 𝑗 corresponding to the
vector space model representation of terms 𝑡𝑖 and

It is important to point out that SIMCOS is cal-
culated on a “predefined” vocabulary of interest;
the appropriate selection of this vocabulary helps
to get a better representation of terms, and, conse-
quently, a more accurate estimation of their seman-
tic similarities.

The main motivation for this collaboration was to
investigate the relevance of using diverse strategies
for computing word similarities and the effective-

tic similarity of texts.
The proposed method used a set of measures
provided by each one of the groups. These meas-
ures were employed as features to obtained a pre-
diction model for the STS. Table 1 summarizes the
used measures. For the generation and fitting of the
model we used three approaches: linear regression,
a Gaussian process and a multilayer neural net-

of the SWS was performed over the Reuters-21578

is a well-known corpus and also because it in-

The methods proposed by our group do not require
to be trained, i.e., they do not require tagged data,
only a reference corpus, therefore, it was possible
to evaluate them on the whole training set available
this year. Table 3 shows their results on this set.

Results in Table 3 show that the use of the co-
occurrence information improves the correlation
with human judgments. It also shows that the use
of context information further improves the results.
One surprising finding was the competitive per-
formance of our baseline method; it is considerably
better than the previous year’s baseline result
(0.31).
In order to evaluate the method done in collabo-
ration with LIPN and UMCC_DLSI, we carried
out several experiments using the features provided
by each group independently and in conjunction
with the others. The experiments were performed
over the whole training set by means of two-fold
cross-validation. The individual and global results
are shown in Table 4.
As shown in Table 4, the result corresponding to
the combination of all features clearly outper-
formed the results obtained by using each team´s
features independently. Moreover, the best combi-
nation of features, containing selected features
from the three teams, obtained a correlation value
very close to last year&apos;s winner result.

As shown in Table 5, the performances of the

caused by the use of a larger vocabulary for the
computation of co-occurrence statistics than for the
calculation of the context similarities. We had to
use a smaller vocabulary for the later because its
higher computational cost.

information about the semantic similarity of words
allows improving the estimation of the semantic
similarity of texts. The advantage of this approach
over the two proposed methods was especially
clear on the OnWN and FNWN datasets, which
were created upon WordNet information. Some-
how this result was predictable since several meas-

information to compute the semantic similarity of
words. However, this pattern was not the same for
the other two (WordNet unrelated) datasets. In

The main conclusion of this experiment is that it is
possible to extract useful knowledge from raw
corpora for evaluating the semantic similarity of
texts. Other important conclusion is that the com-
bination of methods (or word semantic similarity
measures) helps improving the accuracy of STS.
As future work we plan to carry out a detailed
analysis of the used measures, with the aim of de-
termining their complementariness and a better
way for combining them. We also plan to evaluate
the impact of the size and vocabulary richness of
the reference corpus on the accuracy of the pro-
posed STS methods.

Unfortunately, despite the great effort that has been the creation of WordNet, it is still far to cover all existing words and senses (Curran, 2003).Therefore, the semantic similarity methods that use this resource tend to reduce their applicability to a restricted domain and to a specific language. We recognize the necessity of having and using manually-constructed semantic-knowledge sources in order to get precise assessments of the semantic similarity of texts, but, in turn, we also consider that it is possible to obtain good estimations of these similarities using less-expensive, and perhaps broader, information sources. In particular our proposal is to automatically extract the semantic knowledge from large amounts of raw data sample</context>

Following we present our baseline method, then, we introduce the two proposed methods as well as a method done in collaboration with other groups. The idea of this shared-method is to enhance the estimation of the semantic textual similarity by combining different and diverse strategies for computing word similarities. 2.1 STS-baseline method Given textsD1 and D2, their textual similarity is given by: STS − Baseline = MIN(SIM(D1, D2 ), SIM(D2, D1)) where 1 In the experiments we considered a window (context) formed of 15 surrounding words. 2Such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Turney, 2005). SIM(Di,DQ = 1Y 1(tk E Dj) |Di |. This measure is based on a direct matching of tokens. It simply counts the number of tokens from one text Di that also exist in the other text Dj . Because STS is a symmetrical attribute, unlike Textual Entailment (Agirre et al., 2012), we designed it as a symmetric measure. We assumed that the relationship between both texts is at least equal to their smaller asymmetric similarity. 2.2 The proposed STS methods These methods incorporate semantic knowledge extracted from a reference corpus. They aim to take advantage of the latent semantic knowledge from a lar</context>

The third method was done in collaboration with groups from the Universities of Paris 13, Matanzas and Alicante. It uses several word similarity measures as features in order to construct an accurate prediction model for the STS. 1 Introduction Even with the current progress of the natural language processing, evaluating the semantic text similarity is an extremely challenging task. Due to the existence of multiple semantic relations among words, the measuring of text similarity is a multifactorial and highly complex task (Turney, 2006). Despite the difficulty of this task, it remains as one of the most attractive research topics for the NLP community. This is because the evaluation of text similarity is commonly used as an internal module in many different tasks, such as, information retrieval, question answering, document summarization, etc. (Resnik, 1999). Moreover, most of these tasks require determining the “semantic” similarity of texts showing stylistic differences or using polysemicwords (Hliaoutakis et al., 2006).
