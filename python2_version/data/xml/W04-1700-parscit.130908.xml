<bodyText confidence="0.997679230769231">
The idea of this workshop arose on the occasion of an international workshop on
eLearning and Computational Linguistics, organized by the MiLCA project and
held in Blaubeuren in November 2003 (in the MiLCA project - Medieninten-
sive Lehrmodule in der Computerlinguistik-Ausbildung, cf. http://milca.sfs.uni-
tuebingen.de -, five German partners are developing core modules for a CL cur-
riculum as web based trainings or virtual courses.). It, therefore, seemed fitting
and timely to identify this topic as one of the leading themes of the workshop.
The COLING 2004 conference appeared to the participants as a good opportu-
nity for such an event. We are very grateful to the COLING organizers to have
given us the opportunity to conduct a workshop with the title eLearning for
Computational Linguistics and Computational Linguistics for eLearning. This
title reflects the two main topics that the participants of the MiLCA workshop
had identified as the two leading themes to be addressed.

MiLCA is not the only project focussing on eLearning in support of teach-
ing Computational Linguistics. We are aware of numerous individual and
institutional efforts of the kind under way. This topic should also be
viewed as a follow-up of the 1999 EACL workshop Computer and Internet
Supported Education in Language and Speech Technology, the 2002 ACL
workshop on Effective Tools and Methodologies for Teaching NLP, and
the LREC 2004 workshop on Language Resources: Integration and Devel-
opment in eLearning and in Teaching Computational Linguistics. It will
give practioners in the field the opportunity to share didactic experience
of eTeaching CL, to identify and to disseminate good practice models and
resources and to share novel approaches to eLearning in CL.

This part of the workshop addresses the role which language technology
plays in the development of intelligent platforms for eLearning. One fo-
cus of this part of the workshop concerns the contribution of NLP to the
building of intelligent computer-aided language learning (I-CALL) sys-
tems. Another leading question of this topic area concerns the way in
which NLP can improve the performance of eLearning environments in
general.
We were glad to receive a large number of high-quality papers, most of which
will be presented on the workshop and can be found in this volume.
For presentation on the workshop, we have grouped the papers into the following
sections:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.951415153846154">
• The first paper gives an overview of the issues involved in NLP for eLearn-
ing. Some approaches are outlined and illustrated by projects of the author
and his colleagues;
• This is followed by three papers which present examples of language learn-
ing systems and environments. These papers focus on the role which NLP
plays in them;
• The largest group of five papers presents ways in which NLP can help
teachers to assess and evaluate the response of students to tasks of various
kinds;
• Two papers describe computational systems which help students of lin-
guistics and computational linguistics to acquire relevant knowledge by
e-learning;
• The last three papers present further important aspects of NLP and

eLearning: in the first paper, an NLP-driven environment for foreign lan-
guage learning in primary schools is presented; the second paper focuses
on the use of semi-automatic annotation at different stages of the learning
process; the last paper deals with the use of Text Mining in the context
of learning ancient Chinese poetry.
We hope that you will enjoy the workshop and the proceedings as much as we
have enjoyed its preparation. May this workshop be a forum for the exchange
of ideas on the intersection of Computational Linguistics and eLearning and a
starting point for further fruitful co-operations.
The work of the T¨ubingen group in the preparation of this workshop has been
partially supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research
(BMBF), in the context of the MiLCA project. We would like to express our
gratitude for this support.
