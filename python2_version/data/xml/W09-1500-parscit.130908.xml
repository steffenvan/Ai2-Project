Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.894273875">
Software engineering is a first-class research topic in computer science, but generally has not been
treated as such within the natural language processing community. However, the need for well-
engineered NLP components is increasing as NLP begins to show up outside our research community:
bioinformatics, the search industry, education applications, etc. In addition, NLP research itself, e.g.,
when it involves large data sets, often requires a high level of software quality. Simply applying standard
software engineering practices to NLP often fails due to the unique characteristics of natural language
as an input type.
The goals of this workshop include raising awareness of the need for good software engineering
practices in NLP, stimulating research on same, and providing a forum for sharing current work in
this area. We are grateful to the authors for sharing their work, our invited speaker, and to the program
committee for their efforts.
