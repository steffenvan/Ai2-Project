<bodyText confidence="0.993441925925926">
The 2010 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning is the fourteenth in the series of
annual meetings organized by SIGNLL, the ACL special interest group on natural language learning.
CONLL-2010 will be held in Uppsala, Sweden, 15-16 July 2010, in conjunction with ACL.
For our special focus this year in the main session of CoNLL, we invited papers relating to grammar
induction, from a machine learning, natural language engineering and cognitive perspective. We
received 99 submissions on these and other relevant topics, of which 18 were eventually withdrawn. Of
the remaining 81 papers, 12 were selected to appear in the conference programme as oral presentations,
and 13 were chosen as posters. All accepted papers appear here in the proceedings. Following the ACL
2010 policy we allowed an extra page in the camera ready paper for authors to incorporate reviewer
comments, so each accepted paper was allowed to have nine pages plus any number of pages containing
only bibliographic references.
As in previous years, CoNLL-2010 has a shared task, Learning to detect hedges and their scope in
natural language text. The Shared Task papers are collected into an accompanying volume of CoNLL-
2010.
First and foremost, we would like to thank the authors who submitted their work to CoNLL-2010. We
are grateful to our invited speakers, Lillian Lee and Zoubin Ghahramani, who graciously agreed to give
talks at CoNLL. Special thanks to the SIGNLL board members, Lluis M`arquez and Joakim Nivre, for
their valuable advice and assistance each step of the way, and Erik Tjong Kim Sang, who acted as the
information officer and maintained the CoNLL-2010 web page.
We also appreciate the help we received from the ACL programme chairs, especially Stephen Clark. The
help of the ACL 2010 publication chairs, Jing-Shin Chang and Philipp Koehn, technical support by Rich
Gerber from softconf.com, as well as input from Priscilla Rasmussen was invaluable in producing these
proceedings.
Finally, many thanks to Google for sponsoring the best paper award at CoNLL-2010.
We hope you enjoy the conference!
