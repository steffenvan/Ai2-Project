We describe the knowledge acquisition (KA) tech-
niques used to build the STOP system, especially
sorting and think-aloud protocols. That is, we de-
scribe the ways in which we interacted with domain
experts to determine appropriate user categories,
schemas, detailed content rules, and so forth for
STOP. Informal evaluations of these techniques sug-
gest that they had some benefit, but perhaps were
most successful as a source of insight and hypothe-
ses, and should ideally have been supplemented by
other techniques when deciding on the specific rules
and knowledge incorporated into STOP.

I Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999672727272727">
An important aspect of building natural-language
generation (NLG) systems is knowledge acquisition.
This is the process of acquiring the specific knowl-
edge needed in a particular application about the
domain, the language used in the domain genre,
the readers of the texts, and so forth. Such knowl-
edge influences, for example, the system&apos;s content
selection rules (whether represented as schemas, pro-
duction rules, or plan operators); the system&apos;s mi-
croplanning choice rules (lexicalisation, referring ex-
pression generation, aggregation); and perhaps even
the system&apos;s grammar (if a genre grammar is needed,
as is the case, for example, with weather reports).
To date, knowledge acquisition for NLG systems
has largely been based on corpus analysis, infor-
mal interactions with experts, and informal feed-
back from users (Reiter et al., 1997; Reiter and Dale,
2000). For example, the PlanDoc developers (McK-
eown et al., 1994) interviewed users to get a gen-
eral understanding of the domain and user require-
ments; asked a single expert to write some example
output texts; and then analysed this corpus in vari-
ous ways. Other KA techniques used in the past for
building NLG systems include letting domain experts
specify content rules in pseudo-code (Goldberg et al.,
1994) and ethnographic techniques such as observing
doctors and patients in real consultations (Forsythe,
1995).
As part of the STOP project (Reiter et al., 1999) to
generate personalised smoking-cessation leaflets, we
investigated using some of the structured KA tech-
niques developed by the expert-system community
(see, for example, (Scott et al., 1991)) for acquiring
the knowledge needed by an NLG system. In this
paper we summarise our experiences. Very briefly,
our overall conclusion is that in STOP, structured KA
was probably useful for getting insight into and for-
mulating hypotheses about the knowledge needed by
an NLG system. However, formulating detailed rules
purely on the basis of such KA was not ideal, and it
would have been preferable to use other information
as well during this process, such as statistics about
smokers and feedback from smoker evaluations of
draft STOP leaflets.

2 Background: The STOP System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98013262962963">
The STOP system generates personalised smoking-
cessation leaflets, based on the recipient&apos;s responses
to a questionnaire about smoking beliefs, concerns,
and experiences. STOP leaflets consist of four A5
pages, of which only the two inside pages are fully
generated; an example of the inside pages of a STOP
leaflet are shown in Figure 2. Internally, STOP is
a fairly conventional shallow NIX system, with its
main innovation being the processing used to control
the length of leaflets (Reiter, 2000). STOP has been
evaluated in a clinical trial, which compared cessa-
tion rates among smokers who received STOP leaflets:
smokers who received a non-personalised leaflet with
similar structure and appearance to a STOP leaflet;
and smokers who did not receive any leaflet (but did
fill out a questionnaire). Unfortunately, we cannot
discuss the results of the clinical trial in this paperl .
One of the research goals of the STOP project was
to explore the use of expert-system knowledge acqui-
sition techniques in building an NLG system. These
knowledge acquisition sessions were primarily car-
ried out with the following experts:
Our medical colleagues intend to publish a paper about
the clinical trial in a medical journal, and have requested
that we not publish anything about the results of the trial in
a computing journal or conference until they have published
in a medical journal.

tion leaflets

None of these experts were paid for their time. We
also did a small amount of KA with a (paid) graphic
designer on layout and typography issues.
2.1 Unusual Aspects of STOP from a KA
Perspective
KA research in the expert-system community has
largely focused on applications such as medical di-
agnosis, where (1) there is a single correct solution,
and (2) the task being automated is one currently
done by a human expert. STOP is a different type
of application in that (1) there are many possible
leaflets which can be generated (and the system can-
not tell which is best), and (2) no human currently
writes personalised smoking-cessation leaflets (be-
cause manually writing such leaflets is too expen-
sive). Point (2) in particular was repeatedly em-
phasised by the experts we worked with. The doc-
tors and the nurse were experts on oral consultations
with smokers, and the health psychologist was an ex-
pert on writing non-personalised health information
leaflets, but none of them had experience writing
personalised smoking-cessation leaflets.
Many NLG systems have similar characteristics.
The flexibility of language means that there are al-
most always many ways of communicating informa-
tion and fulfilling communicative goals in a gen-
erated text; in other words, there are many pos-
sible texts that can be generated. Furthermore,
while some synthesis tasks, such as configuration and
scheduling, can be formalised as finding an optimal
solution under a well-defined numerical evaluation
function, this is difficult in NLG because of our poor
understanding of how to computationally evaluate
texts for effectiveness.
With regard to human expertise, some NLG sys-
tems do indeed generate documents, such as weather
reports and customer-service letters. which are cur-
rently written by humans. But many systems are
similar to STOP in that they generate texts — such as
descriptions of software models (Lavoie et al., 1997)
and customised descriptions of museum items (Ober-
lander et al., 1998) — which are useful in principle
but are not currently written by humans, perhaps
because of cost or response-time issues.

3 KA Techniques Used in STOP
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992452">
3.1 Sorting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991628288461538">
Sorting is a standard KA technique for building up
taxonomies. Experts in a sorting exercise are given
a set of entities, and asked to divide the set. into
subsets, and &apos;think aloud&apos; into a tape recorder as
they do so.
In STOP, we used sorting to build a classification of
smokers. We started off with an initial classification
which was motivated by the Stages of Change psy-
chological theory (Prochaska and diClemente, 1992):
this divided smokers into the three categories of Pre-
contemplators (not intending to quit anytime soon),
Contemplators (seriously considering quitting), and
Preparers (definitely decided to quit, and soon). We
wished to refine these categories, especially Precon-
templator (which includes 67% of smokers in the Ab-
erdeen area), and used sorting to do so. The basic
exercise consisted of giving a doctor three sets of
questionnaires (a set from Precontemplators; a set
from Contemplators; and a set from Preparers), and
asking him or her to subdivide each set into sub-
sets. We repeated this exercise with three different
doctors.
The results of this exercise were complex, and the
doctors were not in full agreement. After some anal-
ysis, we proposed to them that we subdivide all three
categories on the basis of desire to quit. Precon-
templators in particular would be divided up into
people who neither want nor intend to quit (Com-
mitted Smokers); people who have mixed feelings
about smoking but don&apos;t yet intend to quit (Clas-
sic Precontemplators); and people who would like to
quit but aren&apos;t intending to quit, typically because
they don&apos;t think they&apos;ll succeed (Lacks Confidence).
The three doctors agreed that this was a reasonable
subcategorisation, and we proceeded on this basis.
In particular, we operationalised this categorisation
as follows:
o We added the question Would you like to stop
if it was easy to the questionnaire. People
who answered No were put into the &apos;Commit-
ted Smoker&apos; category. For people who answered
Not Sure or Yes, we looked at their decisional
balance, that is the number of likes and dislikes
they had about smoking, and placed them into
Lacks Confidence if their dislikes clearly out-
numbered their likes, and Classic Precontem-
plator otherwise.
0 We defined different high-level sehemas for
each of these categories; these schemas essen-
tially specified which sections and (in some
cases) paragraphs should be included in the
leaflet, but not the detailed content of individ-

of the drawbacks of smoking, and suggested

backs of smoking; and Lacks Confidence smok-

ers got letters which focused on confidence-
building and- dealing...with:barriers to quitting
(such as addiction or fear of weight gain). The
example leaflet shown in Figure 2, incidentally,
is for a Lacks Confidence smoker.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.471215">
3.1.1 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999255489795918">
After the clinical trial was underway, we attempted
to partially evaluate the sorting-derived categories
by doing a statistical analysis of the differences be-
tween smokers in the groups. In other words, we
hypothesised that if our categories were correct in
distinguishing different types of smokers, then we
should observe differences in characteristics such as
addiction and confidence between the groups. Of
course, this is not an ideal evaluation because it does
not test the hypothesis that the different classes of
smokers we proposed should receive different types
of leaflets; but this is a difficult hypothesis to test
directly.
In any case, our analysis suggested that the smok-
ers in each group did indeed have different character-
istics. However, it also suggested that we might have
done as well (in terms of creating subgroups with dif-
ferent characteristics) by subcategorising purely on
the Would you like to stop if it was easy question,
and ignoring likes and dislikes about smoking. The
analysis also suggested that it might have been use-
ful to subcategorise on the basis of addiction, which
we did not do. In fact during the sorting exercises
the doctors did mention dividing into groups par-
tially on the basis of the difficulty that individuals
would have in quitting, but we did not implement
this.
The statistical analysis also suggested some ways
of possibly improving the content schemas. For
example, the analysis showed that the Committed
Smoker category included many light smokers who
probably smoked for social reasons; it might have
been useful to specifically address this in the STOP
leaflets (&apos;quit now, before you become addicted&apos;).
In retrospect. then, the sorting exercise was use-
ful in proposing ideas about how to divide Stages
of Change categories, and in new questions to ask
smokers. However, the process of .defining detailed
category classification rules and content schemas
would have benefited greatly from statistical data
about smokers in our target region. In STOP we
did not have such data until after the clinical trial
had started (and smokers had returned their ques-
tionnaires), by which time the system could not be
changed. So it would have been difficult to base
smoker classification on statistical smoker data in
STOP ; but certainly we would recommend such an
approach in projects where good data is available at
the olitset.

3.2 Think-aloud Protocols
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994644403846154">
The-detailed-content. and phrasing of sToii letters
was largely based on think-aloud example sessions
with experts. In these sessions, health professionals
would be given a questionnaire and asked to write
a letter or leaflet for this person. They were also
asked to &apos;think aloud&apos; into a tape recorder while they
did this, explaining their reasoning. Again this is a
standard expert-system technique for KA.
3.2.1 Example
siniple-exainple-ofthe think-aloud process is as fol-
lows. One of the doctors wrote a letter for a smoker
who had tried to quit before, and managed to stop
for several weeks before starting again_ The doc-
tor made the following comments in the think-aloud
transcript:
Has he tried to stop smoldng before? Yes,
and the longest he has managed to stop —
he has ticked the one week right up to three
months and that&apos;s encouraging in that he
has managed to stop at least once before,
because it is always said that the people
who have had one or two goes are more
likely to succeed in the future.
He also included the following paragraph in the
letter that he wrote for this smoker:
I see that you managed to stop smoking on
one or two occasions before but have gone
back to smoking, but you will be glad to
know that this is very common and most
people who finally stop smoking have had
one or two attempts in the past before
they finally succeed. What it does show is
that you are capable of stopping even for a
short period, and that means you are much
more likely to be able to stop permanently
than somebody who has never ever stopped
smoking at all.
After analysing this session, we proposed two
rules:
el IF (previous attempt to quit) THEN (message:
more likely to succeed)
IF (previous attempt to quit) THEN (message:
most people who quit have a few unsuccessful
attempts first)
The final system incorporated a rule &apos;(based Ort
several KA sessions, not just the above one) that
stated that if the smoker had tried to quit before,
then the confidence-building section of the leaflet
(which is only included for some smoker categories,
see Section 3_1) should include a short message
about previous attempts to quit. This message
should mention length of previous cessation if this

was greater than one week; otherwise, it should men-
tion recency of previous-attempt if this was within
the past 6 months. The actual text generated from
this rule in the example leaflet of Figure 2 is
Although you don&apos;t feel confident that you
would be able to stop if you were to try,
you have several things in your favour.
e You have stopped before for more than
a month.
Note that the message (text) produced by -the ac-
tual STOP code is considerably simpler than the text
originally written by the expert. This is fairly com-
mon, as is simplifications in the logic used to decide
whether to include a message in a leaflet or not. In
some cases this is due to the expert having much
more knowledge and expertise than the computer
system (Reiter and Dale, 2000, pp 30-36). Con-
sider, for example, the following extract from the
same think-aloud session
The other thing I notice is that he lives in
[Address] which I would suspect is quite a
few floors up and that he is probably get-
ting quite puffy on the stairs ... and if he
gets more breathless he&apos;ll end up being a
prisoner in his own house because he&apos;ll be
able to get down, but he won&apos;t be able to
get up again
This type of reasoning perhaps requires too much
general &apos;world knowledge&apos; about addresses, stairs,
and breathlessness to be implementable in a com-
puter system.
</bodyText>

3.2.2 Evaluation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999805202898551">
Afterwards, we attempted to partially evaluate the
rules derived from think-aloud sessions by showing
STOP leaflets to smokers and other smoking profes-
sionals, and asking for comments. The results were
mixed. In terms of content, some smokers found
the content of the leaflets to be useful and appropri-
ate for them, but others said they would have liked
to see different types of information, For example,
STOP leaflets did not go into the medical details of
smoking (as none of the think-aloud expert-written
letters contained such information), and while this
seemed like the right choice for many smokers, a few
smokers did say that they would have liked to see
more medical information about smoking. Reactions
to style were also mixed. For example, based on KA
sessions we adopted a positive tone and did not try
to scare smokers; and again this seemed right for
most smokers, but some smokers said that a more
&apos;brutal&apos; approach would be more effective for them.
An issue which our experts (and other project
members) disagreed on was whether leaflets should
always use short and simple sentences, or whether
sentence length and complexity should be varied de-
- pending-on the characteristics of- the smoker. In
the STOP implementation we decided to always use
moderately simple sentences, and not vary sentence
complexity for different users. After the clinical trial
started, we performed a small experiment to test this
hypothesis. In this experiment, we took a computer-
generated leaflet and asked one expert (who be-
lieved that short sentences with simple words should
always be used) to revise the computer-generated
leaflet to make it as-easy to read as possible, and
another expert (who believed that more complex
sentences were sometimes appropriate, and such
sentences could in some cases make letters seem
friendlier and more understanding) to revise the
computer-generated leaflet to make it friendlier and
more understanding. The revisions made by the ex-
perts were primarily microplanning ones (using NLG
terminology) — that is, aggregation, ellipsis, lexical
choice, and syntactic choice. We then showed the
two expert-revised leaflets to 20 smokers and asked
them which they preferred. The smokers essentially
split 50-50 on this question (8 preferred the easy-to-
read leaflet, 9 preferred the friendly-understanding
leaflet, 3 thought both were the same). This sug-
gests that in principle it indeed may be useful to
vary microplanning choices for different leaflet re-
cipients. We hope to further investigate this issue in
future research.
Overall, a general finding of the evaluation was
that there were many kinds of variations (includ-
ing whether to include detailed medical information,
whether to adopt a &apos;positive&apos; or &apos;brutal&apos; tone, and
how complex sentences should be) which were not
performed by STOP but might have increased leaflet
effectiveness if they had been performed. These
types of variations were either not observed at all
in the think-aloud sessions, or were observed in ses-
sions with some experts but not others.
In terms of KA methodology, perhaps the key les-
son is similar to the one from the sorting sessions; the
think-aloud Kit sessions were very useful in suggest-
ing ideas and hypotheses about STOP content and
phrasing rules, but we should have used other in-
formation sources, such as smoker evaluations and
small comparison experiments, to help refine and
test these rules.

3.3 Other techniques

<bodyText confidence="0.9955335">
Some of the other KA techniques we tried are briefly
described below. These had less influence on the
system than the sorting and think-aloud exercises
described above.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.717958">
3.3.1 Expert Revision

<bodyText confidence="0.988480666666667">
We gave experts leaflets produced by the STOP
system and asked them to critique and revise
them. This was especially useful in suggesting local

changes, such as what phrases or sentences should
be used to communicate particulaL.message._For
example, an early version of the STOP system used
the phrase there are lots of good reasons for stop-
ping. One of the experts commented during a re-
vision session that the phrasing should be changed
to emphasise that the reasons listed (in this particu-
lar section of the STOP leaflet) were ones the smoker
himself had selected in the questionnaire he filled
out. This eventually led to the revised wording It
is encouraging that yo.0 have many good. reasons for
stopping, which is in the first paragraph of the ex-
ample leaflet in Figure 2.
Revision was less useful in suggesting larger
changes to the system, and after the clinical trial
was underway, one of our experts commented that
he might have been able to suggest larger changes
if we had explained the system&apos;s reasoning to him,
instead of just giving him a leaflet to revise. In other
words, just as we asked experts to think-aloud&apos; as
they wrote leaflets, in order to understand their rea-
soning, it would be useful if we could give the experts
something like the computer-system &apos;thinking aloud&apos;
as it produced a leaflet, so they could understand its
reasoning.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.976041">
3.3.2 Group activities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998745">
Because experts often disagreed, we tried a variety of
activities where a group of experts either discussed
or collaboratively authored a leaflet, in the hopes
that this would help resolve or at least clarify con-
flicting opinions. This seemed to work best when we
asked two experts to collaborate, and was less sat-
isfactory with larger groups. Several experts com-
mented that the larger (that is, more than 2-3 peo-
ple) group sessions would have benefited from more
structure and perhaps a professional facilitator.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.849645">
3.3.3 Smoker feedback
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.814308486486486">
As mentioned in Section 3.2, we showed several
smokers the leaflet sToP produced for them, and
asked them to comment on the leaflet. In addi-
tion to its role as an evaluation exercise for other
KA techniques, we hoped that these sessions would
in themselves give us ideas for leaflet content and
phrasing rules. This was again less successful than
we had hoped. Part of the problem was the smokers
knew very little about STOP (unlike our experts, who.
were all familiar with the project), and-often made
comments which were not useful for improving the
system, such as 1 did stop for 10-days -tif-tny -daugh-
ter threw a wobbly and then I wanted a cigarette and
bought some and after smoking for over 30 years I&apos;ve
tried acupuncture and hypnosis all to no avail.
We were also concerned that most of our com-
ments came from well-educated and articulate smok-
ers (for example, university students). It was harder
to get feedback _from less well-educated smokers (for
Paragraph from Nov 97 KA exercise:

could consider using nicotine patches. For people
like yourself who smoke 10-20 cigarettes per day,

determined to stop. You can get more information
on patches from your local pharmacist or GP.
Paragraph from Feb 99 KA exercise:
You. smoke 11,20.cigarettes..a day, and smoke your -
first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking. These
facts suggest you are moderately addicted to nico-
tine, and so you might get withdrawal symptoms for
a time on stopping. It would be worth considering
using nicotine patches when you stop; these double
the chances of success for moderately heavy smokers
such as yourself who make a determined attempt to
stop smoking. Your pharmacist or GP can give you
more information about this.

tates). This led to the worry that the feedback we
were getting was not representative of the popula-
tion of smokers as a whole.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979276">
3.4 KA and the Smoker Questionnaire
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997664166666667">
KA sessions also effected the smoker questionnaire
(STOP&apos;S input) as well as the text-generation com-
ponent of the system. We started with an initial
questionnaire which was largely based on a liter-
ature review of previous projects, and then modi-
fied it based on the information that experts used in
KA sessions. For example, the original questionnaire
asked people who had tried to quit before what quit-
ting techniques they had used in their previous at-
tempts. However, in KA sessions the experts seemed
primarily interested in previous experiences with one
particular technique, nicotine replacement (nicotine
patches or gum); so we replaced the general question
about previous quitting techniques with two ques-
tions which focused on experiences with nicotine re-
placement.
.. 4 ...Stability of Knowledge
In order to determine how stable the results of KA
sessions were, we asked one of our doctors to repeat,
in February 1999 a think-aloud exercise which he
had originally done in November 1997. This exer-
cise required examining and writing letters for two
smokers. The letters and accompanying think-aloud
from the 1999 exercise were somewhat different from
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994742">
221
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987210526316">
the letters and think-aloud from the 1997 exercise; in
very general terms, the 1999 letters had similar core .
content, but expressed the information differently, in
a perhaps (this is very difficult to objectively mea-
sure) more &apos;empathetic&apos; manner. An extract from
this experiment is shown in Figure 1.
We asked a group of seven smokers to compare
one of the 1999 letters with the corresponding letter
from the 1997 exercise. Five preferred the 1999 let-
ter; one preferred the 1997 letter; one thought both
were similar. Written comments from the smokers
suggested that they found the 1999 letter friendlier
and more understanding than the 1997 letter.
in summary, it appears that our experts may
themselves have been learning how to write effec-
tive smoking-cessation leaflets during the course of
the STOP project. In retrospect this is perhaps not
surprising given that none of them had written such
leaflets before the project started.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.914407" genericHeader="method">
5 Evaluation of KA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999597">
An issue that arose several times during the project
was whether we could formally evaluate the effec-
tiveness of KA techniques, in an analogous way to
the manner in which we formally evaluated the ef-
fectiveness of STOP in a clinical trial which com-
pared smoking-cessation rates in STOP and non-
STOP groups. Unfortunately, it was not clear to us
how to do this; how can one evaluate a develop-
ment methodology such as KA? In principle, perhaps
it might be possible to ask two groups to develop
the same system, one using KA and one not, and
then compare the effectiveness of the resultant sys-
tems (perhaps using a STOP-like clinical trial), and
also engineering issues such as development cost and
time-to-completion. This would be an expensive en-
deavour, however, as it would he necessary to pay
for two development efforts. Also, the size of a clin-
ical trial depends on the size of the effect it is trying
to validate, and a clinical trial which compared (for
example) the effectiveness of two kinds of computer-
generated smoking-cessation leaflet might need to
he substantially larger (and hence more expensive)
than a clinical trial that tested the effectiveness of a
computer-generated leaflet against a no-leaflet con-
trol group.
An even more fundamental problem is that in or-
der for such an experiment to produce meaningful re-
sults, it would be necessary to control for differences
in skill, expertise, enthusiasm,-and. luck between the
development teams. It might be necessary to re-
peat this exercise several times, perhaps randomly
choosing which development team will use KA and
which will not. Of course, repeating the experiment
N times will increase the total cost by a factor of N.
As we did not have the resources to do the above,
we elected instead to focus on the smaller &apos;informal&apos;
evaluations described above. We also conducted a
small. experiment where we asked a-group of -five
smoking-cessation counsellors to compare leaflets
produced by an early prototype of STOP with leaflets
produced by the system used in. the clinical trial.
60% of the counsellors thought the clinical trial sys-
tem&apos;s leaflets were more likely to be effective, with
the other 40% thinking the two systems produced
letters of equal effectiveness. This suggests (al-
though does not prove) that the development ef-
fort behind the .clinical trial system improved leaflet
effectiveness. However, we cannot determine how
much of the improvement was due to KA and how
much was due to other development activities.

We are currently in the process of analysing the re-
sults of the clinical trial (which we cannot discuss in
this paper), to see if it sheds any light on the effec-
tiveness of KA. This is not straightforward because
the clinical trial was not designed to give feedback
about KA, but there nevertheless seem to be some
useful lessons here, which we hope to report in sub-
sequent publications.
We also are applying the KA techniques used in
STOP to a project in a different domain, to see how
domain-dependent our findings are. A first attempt
to do this, in a domain which involved giving advice
to university students, failed because the relevant
expert, who initially seemed very enthusiastic, did
not give us enough time for KA. This highlights the
practical observation that KA requires a substantial
amount of time from the expert(s), who must either
be paid or otherwise motivated to participate in the
sessions. In this case we could not pay the expert,
but instead tried to motivate him by pointing out
that a successful system would be useful to him in
his job; this was not in the end sufficient motivation
to get the expert to make time for KA in his (busy)
schedule.
After the above failure we switched to another do-
main, giving feedback to adults who are taking basic-
literacy courses. In this domain, we are working with
a company, Cambridge Training and Development,
which is paying experts for their time when appro-
priate. This work is currently in progress. One inter-
esting KA idea which has already emerged from this
work is observing tutors working with students (we
did not in STOP observe doctors discussing smok-
ing with-their „patients); this is.similar to the_ethno-
graphic techniques suggested by Forsythe (1993).

7 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.99850025">
The expert system community believes that it is
worth interacting with experts using structured KA
techniques, instead of just informally chatting to
them or non-interactively studying what they do (as

happens in a traditional corpus analysis). We be-
lieve structured KA techniques .can .also-be..useful in
developing NLG systems, but they are not a panacea
and need to be used with some caution.
In retrospect, KA was probably most effective in
STOP when used as a source of hypotheses about
smoker categories, detailed content rules, the phras-
ing of messages, and so forth. But ideally these hy-
potheses should have been tested and refined using
statistical data about smokers and small-scale eval-
uation exercises.
Of course, a key problem in STOP was that we
were trying to produce texts (personalised smoking-
cessation leaflets) which were not currently produced
by humans; and hence there were perhaps no real hu-
man experts on producing STOP texts. It would be
interesting to see if structured KA techniques were
more effective for developing systems which pro-
duced texts that humans do currently write, such
as weather forecasts and instructional texts.

Furthermore, while some synthesis tasks, such as configuration and scheduling, can be formalised as finding an optimal solution under a well-defined numerical evaluation function, this is difficult in NLG because of our poor understanding of how to computationally evaluate texts for effectiveness. With regard to human expertise, some NLG systems do indeed generate documents, such as weather reports and customer-service letters. which are currently written by humans. But many systems are similar to STOP in that they generate texts — such as descriptions of software models (Lavoie et al., 1997) and customised descriptions of museum items (Oberlander et al., 1998) — which are useful in principle but are not currently written by humans, perhaps because of cost or response-time issues. 3 KA Techniques Used in STOP 3.1 Sorting Sorting is a standard KA technique for building up taxonomies.

In STOP, we used sorting to build a classification of smokers. We started off with an initial classification which was motivated by the Stages of Change psychological theory (Prochaska and diClemente, 1992): this divided smokers into the three categories of Precontemplators (not intending to quit anytime soon), Contemplators (seriously considering quitting), and Preparers (definitely decided to quit, and soon). We wished to refine these categories, especially Precontemplator (which includes 67% of smokers in the Aberdeen area), and used sorting to do so. The basic exercise consisted of giving a doctor three sets of questionnaires (a set from Precontemplators; a set from Contemplators; and a set from Preparers), and asking him or her to subdivide each set into subsets.

STOP leaflets consist of four A5 pages, of which only the two inside pages are fully generated; an example of the inside pages of a STOP leaflet are shown in Figure 2. Internally, STOP is a fairly conventional shallow NIX system, with its main innovation being the processing used to control the length of leaflets (Reiter, 2000). STOP has been evaluated in a clinical trial, which compared cessation rates among smokers who received STOP leaflets: smokers who received a non-personalised leaflet with similar structure and appearance to a STOP leaflet; and smokers who did not receive any leaflet (but did fill out a questionnaire). Unfortunately, we cannot discuss the results of the clinical trial in this paperl . One of the research goals of the STOP project was to explore the use of expert-system knowledge acquisition techniques in building an NLG system. These knowledge acquisition sessions were primarily carried out w</context>

Other KA techniques used in the past for building NLG systems include letting domain experts specify content rules in pseudo-code (Goldberg et al., 1994) and ethnographic techniques such as observing doctors and patients in real consultations (Forsythe, 1995). As part of the STOP project (Reiter et al., 1999) to generate personalised smoking-cessation leaflets, we investigated using some of the structured KA techniques developed by the expert-system community (see, for example, (Scott et al., 1991)) for acquiring the knowledge needed by an NLG system. In this paper we summarise our experiences. Very briefly, our overall conclusion is that in STOP, structured KA was probably useful for getting insight into and formulating hypotheses about the knowledge needed by an NLG system. However, formulating detailed rules purely on the basis of such KA was not ideal, and it would have been preferable to use other information as well during this process, such as statistics about smokers and feedback from smoker evaluations of draft STOP leaflets. 2 Background: The STOP System The STOP system genera</context>
