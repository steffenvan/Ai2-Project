Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999751875">
We present a word substitution approach
to combine the output of different machine
translation systems. Using part of speech
information, candidate words are deter-
mined among possible translation options,
which in turn are estimated through a pre-
computed word alignment. Automatic
substitution is guided by several decision
factors, including part of speech, local
context, and language model probabili-
ties. The combination of these factors
is defined after careful manual analysis
of their respective impact. The approach
is tested for the language pair German-
English, however the general technique it-
self is language independent.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970352941177">
Despite remarkable progress in machine transla-
tion (MT) in the last decade, automatic translation
is still far away from satisfactory quality. Even the
most advanced MT technology as summarized by
(Lopez, 2008), including the best statistical, rule-
based and example-based systems, produces out-
put rife with errors. Those systems may employ
different algorithms or vary in the linguistic re-
sources they use which in turn leads to different
characteristic errors.
Besides continued research on improving MT
techniques, one line of research is dedicated to bet-
ter exploitation of existing methods for the com-
bination of their respective advantages (Macherey
and Och, 2007; Rosti et al., 2007a).
Current approaches for system combination in-
volve post-editing methods (Dugast et al., 2007;
Theison, 2007), re-ranking strategies, or shal-
low phrase substitution. The combination pro-
cedure applied for this pape tries to optimize
word-level translations within a ”trusted” sentence
frame selected due to the high quality of its syntac-
tic structure. The underlying idea of the approach
is the improvement of a given (original) translation
through the exploitation of additional translations
of the same text. This can be seen as a simplified
version of (Rosti et al., 2007b).
Considering our submission from the shared
translation task as the ”trusted” frame, we add
translations from four additional MT systems that
have been chosen based on their performance in
terms of automatic evaluation metrics. In total, the
combination system performs 1,691 substitutions,
i.e., an average of 0.67 substitutions per sentence.

Our system combination approach computes a
combined translation from a given set of machine
translations. Below, we present a short overview
by describing the different steps in the derivation
of a combined translation.
Compute POS tags for translations. We apply
part-of-speech (POS) tagging to prepare the
selection of possible substitution candidates.
For the determination of POS tags we use the
Stuttgart TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).
Create word alignment. The alignment between
source text and translations is needed to
identify translation options within the differ-
ent systems’ translations. Word alignment
is computed using the GIZA++ toolkit (Och
and Ney, 2003), only one-to-one word align-
ments are employed.
Select substitution candidates. For the shared
task, we decide to substitute nouns, verbs
and adjectives based on the available POS
tags. Initially, any such source word is con-
sidered as a possible substitution candidate.
As we do not want to require substitution can-

didates to have exactly the same POS tag as
the source, we use groups of “similar” tags.
Compute decision factors for candidates. We
define several decision factors to enable an
automatic ranking of translation options.
Details on these can be found in section 4.
Evaluate the decision factors and substitute.
Using the available decision factors we
compute the best translation and substitute.
The general combination approach is language
independent as it only requires a (statistical) POS
tagger and GIZA++ to compute the word align-
ments. More advanced linguistic resources are not
required. The addition of lexical resources to im-
prove the extracted word alignments has been con-
sidered, however the idea was then dropped as we
did not expect any short-term improvements.

3 System selection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859">
Our system combination engine takes any given
number of translations and enables us to compute
a combined translation out of these. One of the
given system translations is chosen to provide the
”sentence skeleton”, i.e. the global structure of the
translation, thus representing the reference system.
All other systems can only contribute single words
for substitution to the combined translation, hence
serve as substitution sources.

<bodyText confidence="0.99999025">
Following our research on hybrid translation try-
ing to combine the strengths of rule-based MT
with the virtues of statistical MT, we choose our
own (usaar) submission from the shared task to
provide the sentence frame for our combination
system. As this translation is based upon a rule-
based MT system, we expect the overall sentence
structure to be of a sufficiently high quality.

3.2 Substitution sources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993814">
For the implementation of our combination sys-
tem, we need resources of potential substitution
candidates. As sources for possible substitution,
we thus include the translation results of the fol-
lowing four systems:

The decision to select the output of these par-
ticular MT systems is based on their performance
in terms of different automatic evaluation metrics
obtained with the IQMT Framework by (Gim´enez
and Amig´o, 2006). This includes BLEU, BLEU1,
TER, NIST, METEOR, RG, MT06, and WMT08.

On grounds of these results we anticipate the
four above named translation engines to perform
best when being combined with our hybrid ma-
chine translation system. We restrict the substi-
tution sources to the four potentially best systems
in order to omit bad substitutions and to reduce
the computational complexity of the substitution
problem. It is possible to choose any other num-
ber of substitution sources.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983571428571">
As mentioned above, we consider nouns, verbs
and adjectives as possible substitution candidates.
In order to allow for automatic decision making
amongst several translation options we define a set
of factors, detailed in the following. Furthermore,
we present some examples in order to illustrate the
use of the factors within the decision process.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.95809">
4.1 Decision factors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.948446642857143">
The set of factors underlying the decision proce-
dure consists of the following:
A: Matching POS. This Boolean factor checks
whether the target word POS tag matches the
source word’s POS category. The factor com-
pares the source text to the reference trans-
lation as we want to preserve the sentential
structure of the latter.
B: Majority vote. For this factor, we compute
an ordered list of the different translation op-
tions, sorted by decreasing frequency. A con-
sensus between several systems may help to
identify the best translation.
Both the reference system and the Google
submission receive a +1 bonus, as they ap-
peared to offer better candidates in more
cases within the small data sample of our
manual analysis.
C: POS context. Further filtering is applied de-
termining the words’ POS context. This is
especially important as we do not want to de-
grade the sentence structure maintained by
the translation output of the reference system.
In order to optimize this factor, we conduct
trials with the single word, the −1 left, and
the +1 right context. To reduce complex-
ity, we shorten POS tags to a single character,
e.g. NN —* N or NPS —* N.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.884733333333333">
D: Language Model. We use an English lan-
guage model to score the different translation
options. As the combination system only re-
places single words within a bi-gram context,
we employ the bi-gram portion of the English
Gigaword language model.

<bodyText confidence="0.9982875">
The language model had been estimated us-
ing the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).

4.2 Factor configurations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999312555555556">
To determine the best possible combination of our
different factors, we define four potential factor
configurations and evaluate them manually on a
small set of sentences. The configurations differ
in the consideration of the POS context for factor
C (strict including −1 left context versus relaxed
including no context) and in the usage of factor A
Matching POS (+A). Table 2 shows the settings of
factors A and C for the different configurations.

Our manual evaluation of the respective substi-
tution decisions taken by different factor combi-
nation is suggestive of the ”relaxed+A” configura-
tion to produce the best combination result. Thus,
this configuration is utilized to produce sound
combined translations for the complete data set.

4.3 Factored substitution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997016857142857">
Having determined the configuration of the dif-
ferent factors, we compute those for the complete
data set, in order to apply the final substitution step
which will create the combined translation.
The factored substitution algorithm chooses
among the different translation options in the fol-
lowing way:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.922753222222222">
(a) Matching POS? If factor A is activated for
the current factor configuration (+A), sub-
stitution of the given translation options can
only be possible if the factor evaluates to
True. Otherwise the substitution candidate is
skipped.
(b) Majority vote winner? If the majority vote
yields a unique winner, this translation option
is taken as the final translation.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991479">
Using the +1 bonuses for both the reference
system and the Google submission we intro-
duce a slight bias that was motivated by man-
ual evaluation of the different systems’ trans-
lation results.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.906279333333333">
(c) Language model. If several majority vote
winners can be determined, the one with the
best language model score is chosen.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997857777777778">
Due to the nature of real numbers this step
always chooses a winning translation option
and thus the termination of the substitution
algorithm is well-defined.
Please note that, while factors A, B, and D are
explicitly used within the substitution algorithm,
factor C POS context is implicitly used only when
computing the possible translation options for a
given substitution candidate.

We compute system combinations for each of the
four factor configurations defined above. Table
3 displays how many substitutions are conducted
within each of these configurations.
The following examples illustrate the perfor-
mance of the substitution algorithm used to pro-
duce the combined translations.
”Einbruch”: the reference translation for ”Ein-
bruch” is ”collapse”, the substitution sources
propose ”slump” and ”drop”, but also ”col-
lapse”, all three, considering the context,
forming good translations. The majority vote
rules out the suggestions different to the ref-
erence translation due to the fact that 2 more
systems recommend ”collapse” as the correct
translation.
”R¨uckgang”: the reference system translates this
word as ”drop” while all of the substitution
sources choose ”decline” as the correct trans-
lation. Since factor A evaluates to True, i.e.
the POS tags are of the same nature, ”de-
cline” is clearly selected as the best transla-
tion by factor B Majority vote and thus re-
places ”drop” in the final combined transla-
tion result.
”Tagesgesch¨afte”: our reference system trans-
lates ”Tagesgesch¨afte” with ”requirements”,
while two of the substitution systems indi-
cate ”business” to be a better translation. Due
to the +1 bonus for our reference translation
a tie between the two possible translations
emerges, leaving the decision to the language
model score, which is higher for ”business”.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942">
Within the system described in this paper, we ap-
proach a hybrid translation technique combining
the output of different MT systems. Substituting
particular words within a well-structured transla-
tion frame equips us with considerably enhanced
translation output. We obtain promising results
providing substantiated proof that our approach is
going in the right direction.
Further steps in the future will include machine
learning methods to optimize the factor selection.
This was, due to limited amount of time and data,
not feasible thus far. We will also investigate the
potential of phrase-based substitution taking into
account multi-word alignments instead of just sin-
gle word mappings. Additionally, we would like
to continue work on the integration of lexical re-
sources to post-correct the word alignments ob-
tained by GIZA++ as this will directly improve the
overall system performance.

In order to optimize this factor, we conduct trials with the single word, the −1 left, and the +1 right context. To reduce complexity, we shorten POS tags to a single character, e.g. NN —* N or NPS —* N. D: Language Model. We use an English language model to score the different translation options. As the combination system only replaces single words within a bi-gram context, we employ the bi-gram portion of the English Gigaword language model. The language model had been estimated using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). 4.2 Factor configurations To determine the best possible combination of our different factors, we define four potential factor configurations and evaluate them manually on a small set of sentences. The configurations differ in the consideration of the POS context for factor C (strict including −1 left context versus relaxed including no context) and in the usage of factor A Matching POS (+A). Table 2 shows the settings of factors A and C for the different configurations. configuration Matching POS POS context strict disabled −1 left strict+A enabled −1 left relaxed disabled single word relax</context>
