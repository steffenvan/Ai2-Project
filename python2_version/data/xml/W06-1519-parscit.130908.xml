<bodyText confidence="0.999841">
In a Tree Adjoining Grammar, a feature structure
is associated with each node in an elementary
tree (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1991). This fea-
ture structure contains information about how the
node interacts with other nodes in the tree. It
consists of a top part, which generally contains
information relating to the super-node, and a bot-
tom part, which generally contains information
relating to the sub-node.
In this paper, we present a system which can
extract syntactic feature structures from a Tree-
bank to develop a Feature-based Lexicalized
Tree Adjoining Grammars. Several works have
been on extracting grammars, especially using
TAG formalism proposed. Chen (2001) has ex-
tracted lexicalized grammars from English Penn
Treebank and there are other works based on
Chen’s procedure such as Nasr (2004) for French
and Habash and Rambow (2004) for Arabic. Xia
et al. (2000) developed the uniform method of a
grammar extraction for English, Chinese and
Korean. Neumann (2003) extracted Lexicalized
Tree Grammars from English Penn Treebank for
English and from NEGRA Treebank for German.
However, none of these works have tried to ex-
tract syntactic features for FB-LTAG.
We use with Sejong Treebank (SJTree) which
contains 32 054 eojeols (the unity of segmenta-
tion in the Korean sentence), that is, 2 526 sen-
tences. SJTree uses 43 part-of-speech tags and 55
syntactic tags (Sejong Project 2003).

2 Extracting a Feature structure for
FB-LTAG
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997642540540541">
FB-LTAG grammars eventually use reduced
tagset because FB-LTAG grammars contain their
syntactic information in features structures. For
example, NP_SBJ syntactic tag in LTAG is
changed into NP and a syntactic feature
&lt;case=nominative&gt; is added. Therefore, we use
actually a 13 reduced tagset for FB-LTAG gram-
mars compared with a 55 syntactic tagset for an
LTAG without features. From full-scale syntactic
tags which end with _SBJ (subject), _OBJ (ob-
ject) and _CMP (attribute), we extract &lt;case&gt;
features which describe argument structures in
the sentence.
Alongside &lt;case&gt; features, we also extract
&lt;mode&gt; and &lt;tense&gt; from morphological analy-
ses in SJTree. Since however morphological
analyses for verbal and adjectival endings in
SJTree are simply divided into EP, EF and EC
which mean non-final endings, final endings and
conjunctive endings, respectively, &lt;mode&gt; and
&lt;tense&gt; features are not extracted directly from
SJTree. In this paper, we analyze 7 non-final
endings (EP) and 77 final endings (EF) used in
SJTree to extract automatically &lt;mode&gt; and
&lt;tense&gt; features. In general, EF carries &lt;mode&gt;
inflections, and EP carries &lt;tense&gt; inflections.
Conjunctive endings (EC) are not concerned with
&lt;mode&gt; and &lt;tense&gt; features and we only ex-
tract &lt;ec&gt; features with its string value. &lt;ef&gt; and
&lt;ep&gt; features are also extracted with their string
values. Some of non-final endings like si are ex-
tracted as &lt;hor&gt; features which have honorary
meaning. In extracted FB-LTAG grammars, we
present their lexical heads in a bare infinitive
with morphological features such as &lt;ep&gt;, &lt;ef&gt;
and &lt;ec&gt; which make correspond with its in-
flected forms.

&lt;det&gt; is another automatically extractable fea-
ture in SJTree and it is extracted from both syn-
tactic tag and morphological analysis unlike
other extracted features. For example, while
&lt;det=-&gt; is extracted from dependant nouns
which always need modifiers (extracted by mor-
phological analyses), &lt;det=+&gt; is extracted from
_MOD phrases (extracted by syntactic tags).
From syntactic tag DP which contains MMs (de-
terminative or demonstrative), &lt;det=+&gt; is also
extracted. See Table 1 for all the extractable fea-
tures from SJTree.

Korean does not need features &lt;person&gt; or
&lt;number&gt; as in English. Han et al. (2000) pro-
posed several features for Korean FBLTAG
which we do not use in this paper, such as &lt;adv-
pp&gt;, &lt;top&gt; and &lt;aux-pp&gt; for nouns and &lt;clause-
type&gt; for predicates. While postpositions are
separated from eojeol during our grammar ex-
traction procedure, Han et al. considered them as
“one” inflectional morphology of noun phrase
eojeol. &lt;aux-pp&gt; adds semantic meaning of aux-
iliary postpositions such as only, also etc. which
we can not extract automatically from SJTree or
other Korean Treebank corpora because syntacti-
cally annotated Treebank corpora generally do
not contain such semantic information. &lt;top&gt;
marks the presence or absence of a topic marker
in Korean like neun, however topic markers are
annotated like a subject in SJTree which means
that only &lt;case=nominative&gt; is extracted for
topic markers. &lt;clause-type&gt; indicates the type
of the clause which has its values such as main,
coord(inative), subordi(native), adnom(inal),
nominal, aux-connect. Since the distinction of
the type of the clause is very vague except main
clause in Korea, we do not adopt this feature.
Instead, &lt;ef&gt; is extracted if a clause type is a
main clause and for &lt;ec&gt; is extracted for other
types.

3 Experimentations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999315588235294">
The actual procedure of feature extraction is
implemented by two phases. In the first phase,
we convert syntactic tags and morphological
analysis into feature structure as explained above
(see Table 2 for our conversion scheme for
syntactic tags and see Table 3 for morphological
analyses). In the second phase, we complete
feature structure onto nodes of the “spine (path
between root and anchor, node in an initial tree
and path between root and foot node in an
auxiliary tree)”. For example, we put the same
feature of VV bottom in Figure 1a onto VV top,
VP top/bottom and S bottom because nodes in
dorsal spine share certain number of feature of
VV bottom. The initial tree for a verb
balpyoha.eoss.da (‘announced’) in (1) is
completed like Figure 1b for a FB-LTAG.

Finally, extracted grammars are evaluated by its
size (see Figure 2) and its coverage (see Table 5).
The number of tree schemata is not stabilized at
the end of the extraction process, which seems to
indicate that the size of Treebank is not enough
to reach the convergence of extracted grammars.
However, the number of tree schemata appearing
at least twice and three times (threshold = 2 and
3) in Treebank is much stabilized at the end of
the extraction process than that of tree schemata
appearing only once (threshold = 1).
The coverage of extracted grammars is calcu-
lated not only by the frequency of tree schemata
but also by the number of tree schemata.

We manually overlap our 163 tree schemata for
predicates, which contain 14 subcategorization
frames with 11 subcategorization frames of a
FB-LTAG grammar proposed in Han et al.
(2000) to evaluate the coverage of hand-crafted
grammars 1 . Our extracted template grammars
cover 72.7 % of their hand-crafted subcategori-
zation frames2.
1 Our extracted tree schemata contain not only
subcategorization frames but also some phenomena of
syntactic variations, the number of lexicalized trees and the
frequency information while Han el al. (2000) only presents
subcategorization frames and some phenomena.
2 Three subcategorization frames in Han el al. (2000) which
contain prepositional phrases are not covered by our ex-
tracted tree schemata. Generally, prepositional phrases in
SJTree are labeled with _AJT which is marked for adjunc-
tion operation. Since there is no difference between noun
adverbial phrase and prepositional phrases in SJTree like [S
na.neun [NP_AJT ojeon.e ‘morning’] [NP_AJT hakgyo.e ‘to
school’] ga.ss.da] (‘I went to school this morning’), we do
not consider _AJT phrases as arguments.

Chen (2001) has extracted lexicalized grammars from English Penn Treebank and there are other works based on Chen’s procedure such as Nasr (2004) for French and Habash and Rambow (2004) for Arabic. Xia et al. (2000) developed the uniform method of a grammar extraction for English, Chinese and Korean. Neumann (2003) extracted Lexicalized Tree Grammars from English Penn Treebank for English and from NEGRA Treebank for German. However, none of these works have tried to extract syntactic features for FB-LTAG. We use with Sejong Treebank (SJTree) which contains 32 054 eojeols (the unity of segmentation in the Korean sentence), that is, 2 526 sentences. SJTree uses 43 part-of-speech tags and 55 syntactic tags (Sejong Project 2003). 2 Extracting a Feature structure for FB-LTAG FB-LTAG grammars eventually use reduced tagset because FB-LTAG grammars contain their syntactic information in features structures.

The number of tree schemata is not stabilized at the end of the extraction process, which seems to indicate that the size of Treebank is not enough to reach the convergence of extracted grammars. However, the number of tree schemata appearing at least twice and three times (threshold = 2 and 3) in Treebank is much stabilized at the end of the extraction process than that of tree schemata appearing only once (threshold = 1).

For example, NP_SBJ syntactic tag in LTAG is changed into NP and a syntactic feature &lt;case=nominative&gt; is added. Therefore, we use actually a 13 reduced tagset for FB-LTAG grammars compared with a 55 syntactic tagset for an LTAG without features. From full-scale syntactic tags which end with _SBJ (subject), _OBJ (object) and _CMP (attribute), we extract &lt;case&gt; features which describe argument structures in the sentenc</context>
