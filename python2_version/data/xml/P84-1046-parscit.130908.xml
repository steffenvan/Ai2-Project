Searle 1141 has argued forcefully that referring is a speech act;
that people refer, not just expressions. This paper considers what
kind of speech act referring might be. I propose a generalization of
Searle&apos;s &amp;quot;propositional&amp;quot; act of referring that treats it as an illocution-
ary act, a request, and argue that the propositional act of referring is
unnecessary.
The essence of the argument is as follows: First, I consider Searle&apos;s
definition of the propositional act of referring (which I term the PAA,
for Propositional Act Account). This definition is found inadequate
to deal with various utterances in discourse used for the sole pur-
pose of referring. Although the relevance of such utterances to the
propositional act has been defined away by Searle, it is clear that any
comprehensive account of referring should treat them. I develop an ac-
count of their use in terms of a speaker&apos;s requesting the act of referent
identification, which is to be understood in a perceptual sense. This
illocutionary art analysis (IAA) is shown to satisfy Searle&apos;s conditions
for referring yet captures utterances that the PAA cannot. The con-
verse position is then examined: Can the IAA capture the same uses
of referring expressions as the PAA? If one extends the perceptually-
based notion of referent identification to include Searle&apos;s concept of
identification, then by associating a complex propositional attitude
to one use of the definite determiner, a request can be derived. The
IAA thus handles the referring use of definite noun phrases with in-
dependently motivated rules. Referring becomes a kind of requesting.
Hence, the propositional act of referring is unnecessary.

Revising Austin&apos;s [2] locutionary/illocutionary dichotomy, Searle
distinguishes between illocutionary acts (lAs) and propositional acts
(PAs) of referring and predicating. Both kinds of acts are performed
in making an utterance, but propositional acts can only be performed
in the course of performing some illocutionary act.
Let us consider Searle&apos;s rules for referring, which I term the
&amp;quot;propositional act analysis&amp;quot;, or PAA. A speaker, S, &amp;quot;successfully and
non-defectively performs the speech act of singular identifying refer-
ence&amp;quot; in uttering a referring expression, R, in the presence of hearer,
H, in a context, C, if and only if:

Conditions 2 and 3 are justified as follows:
Propositional acts cannot occur alone; that is one can-
not just !emphasis in original â€” PEW] refer and pred-
icate without making an assertion or asking a question
or performing some other illocutionary act ... One only
refers as part of the performance of an illocutionary act,
and the grammatical clothing of an illocutionary act is
the complete sentence. An utterance of a referring ex-
pression only counts as referring if one says something.
p. 25.)
The essence of Conditions 4 and 5 is that the speaker needs to
utter an &amp;quot;identifying description&amp;quot;. For Searle, &amp;quot;identification&amp;quot; means
&amp;quot;... there should no longer be any doubt what exactly is being talked
about&amp;quot;. (Aid, p. 85.) Furthermore, not only should the description
be an identifying one (one that would pick out an object), but the
speaker should intend it to do so uniquely (Condition 5). Moreover,
the speaker&apos;s intention is supposed to be recognized by the hearer
(Condition 6). This latter Gricean 171 condition is needed to distin-
guish having the hearer pick out an object by referring to it versus,
for example, hitting him in the back with it.

In a recent experiment 131, it was shown that in giving instructions
over a telephone, speakers, but not users of keyboards, often made
separate utterances for reference and for predication. Frequently, these
&amp;quot;referential utterances&amp;quot; took the form of existential sentences, such as
&amp;quot;Now, there&apos;s a black 0-ring&amp;quot;. Occasionally, speakers used question
noun phrases &amp;quot;OK, now, the smallest of the red pieces?&amp;quot; The data
present two problems for the PAA.

something It the referent as part of the performance of some illocu-
thmary act. However, it is obvious that speakers can refer by issuing
isolated noun plira,e or prepositional phrases. Since speakers per-
formed illocutionary acts in nothing these utterances, then, according
to Conditions 2 and :f, there should be an act of predication, either
in the sentence or the &amp;quot;similar stretch of discourse&amp;quot;. For example,
consider the flowing dialogue fragment:

<bodyText confidence="0.999991833333333">
The illocutionary act performed by littering phrase (1) is finished
and responded to in phrase (2) before the illocutionary act performed
in phrase (3) containing the predication &amp;quot;put&amp;quot; is performed. The ap-
peal to a sentence or stretch of discourse in which to find the illocu-
tionary act containing the propositional act in (I) is therefore is un-
convincing. The cause of this inadequacy is that, according to Searle,
to perform an illocutionary act, an act of predicating is required, and
the predicate must he uttered (Aid, pp. 126-127). Hence, there is no
appeal to context to supply obvious predications. Likewise, there is
no room for context to supply an obvious focus of attention. Unfortu-
nately, we can easily imagine cases in which an object is mutually, but
nonlinguistically, focused upon (e.g., when Holmes, having come upon
a body on the ground, listens for a heartbeat, and says to Watson:
&apos;Dead&amp;quot;). In such a case, we need only predicate. Thus, the require-
ment that the act of reference he jointly located with some predication
in a sentence or illocutionary act is too restrictive -- the goals involved
with reference and predication can he satisfied separately and contex-
tually. The point of this paper is to bring such goals to the fore.

The second profiles is that most of the separate utterances issued
to secure reference were declarative sentences whose logical form was
3 .r P(z). For example, &amp;quot;there is a little yellow piece of rubber&amp;quot;, and
&amp;quot;it&apos;s got a plug in it&amp;quot;. However, Searle claims that these utterances
contain no referring act. (Aid, p. 29.) How then can speakers use
them to refer?
The answer involves an analysis of indirect speech acts. Although
such declarative utterances can be issued just to be informative, they
are also issued as requests that the hearer identify the referent. 2 The
analysis of these utterances as requests depends on our positing an
action of referent identification.
4. Identification as a Requested Action
In Searle&apos;s account, speakers identify referents for hearers. I re-
vise this notion slightly and treat identification as an act performed
by the hearer rff. I use the term &amp;quot;identify&amp;quot; in a very narrow, though
important and basi,.. sense â€” one that intimately involves perception.
Thus, the analysis is not intended to he general; it applies only to
the case when the referents are perceptually accessible to the hearer,
and when the hearer is intended to use perceptual means to pick them
out. For the time being. I ash explicitly not concerned with a hearer&apos;s
mentally &amp;quot;identifying&amp;quot; sonic entity satisfying a description, or discov-
ering a coreferring description. The perceptual use of &amp;quot;identification&amp;quot;
would appear to he a special case of Searle&apos;s use of the term, and thus
Searle&apos;s conditions should apply to it.
Referent identification in this perceptual sense requires an agent
and a description. The essence of the act is that the agent pick out
the thing or things satisfying the description. The agent need not

coders who were trained by the author, but who worked independently. The
reliability of their codings were high â€” over 90 per cent for such existential
statements.
be the speaker of the description, and indeed, the description need
not be communicated linguistically, or even communicated at all. A
crucial component of referent identification is the act of perceptually
searching for something that satisfies the description. The description
is decomposed by the agent into a plan of action for identifying the
referent. The intended and expected physical, sensory, and cognitive
actions may be signalled by the speaker&apos;s choice of predicates. For
example, a speaker uttering the phrase &amp;quot;the magnetic screwdriver&amp;quot;,
may intend for the hearer to place various screwdrivers against some
piece of iron to determine which is magnetic. Speakers know that
hearers map (at least some) predicates, onto actions that determine
their extensions, and thus, using a model of the hearer&apos;s capabilities
and the causal connections among people, their senses, and physical
objects, design their expression, D, mo that hearers can successfully
execute those actions in the context of the overall plan.
Not only does a speaker plan for a hearer to identify the referent
of a description, but he often indicates his intention that the hearer
do so. According to Searle, one possible way to do this is to use a
definite determiner. Of course, not all definite NP&apos;s are used to refer:
for example, in the sentence &amp;quot;the last piece is the nuzzle&amp;quot;, the referent
of the first NP is intended to be identified, whereas the referent of the
second NP is not. The attributive use of definite noun phrases [GI is a
case in which the speaker has no intention that the hearer identify a
referent. Yet other nonanaphoric uses of definite noun phrases include
labeling an object, correcting a referential miscommunication, having
the hearer wait while the speaker identifies the referent, etc. 3
To respond appropriately, a hearer decides when identification is
the act he is supposed to perform on a description, what part this act &apos;
will play in the speaker&apos;s and hearer&apos;s plans, and how and when to
perform the act. If perceptually identifying a referent i.s represented
as an action in the speaker&apos;s plan, hearers can reason about it j&apos;ist as
any other act, thereby allowing them to infer the 5 peak,r&apos;s Sit,ntions
behind indirect identification requests.
In summary, referent identification shall mean the conducting of
a perceptual search process for the referent of a description. The verb
&amp;quot;pick out&amp;quot; should be taken as synonymous.
The following is a sketchy definition of the referont identification
action, in which the description is formed from &amp;quot;a/the y such that

(i.e., as an action characterizable in a dynamic logic), the illocutionary analysis
applies.
&apos;Actually, Moore characterizes RESULT as taking an event and a formula as
arguments, and an agent&apos;s doing an action denotes an even. This difference is
not critical for what follows.

ceptual accessibility&amp;quot; condition to guarantee that the IDENTIFY-
REFERENT action is applicable. This should guarantee that, for
example, a speaker does not intend someone to pick out the referent of
&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;the first man to land on Mars&amp;quot;. The condition
is satisfied in the experimental task since it rapidly becomes mutual
knowledge that the task requires communication about the objects in
front of the hearer.
The second condition states that X fulfills the description D.
Here, I am ignoring cases in which the description is not literally true
of the intended referent, including metonymy, irony, and the like (but
see 1121). Lastly. D should be a description that is identifiable to this
particular Agt. It should use descriptors whose extension the agent
already knows or can discover via action. I am assuming that we can
know that a combination of descriptors is identifiable without having
formed a plan for identifying the referent.
To give a name to the state of knowledge we are in after
having identified the referent of D, we will use (IDENTIFIED.
REFERENT Agt D X). That is, Agt has identified the referent
of D to be X. Of course, what has been notoriously difficult to specify
is just what Agt has to know about X to say he has identified it as
the referent of D. At a minimum, the notion of identification needs to
be made relative to a purpose, which, perhaps, could be derived from
the bodily actions that someone (in the context) is intended to per-
form upon X. Clearly, &amp;quot;knowing who the D is&amp;quot; 18, 91, is no substitute
for having identified a referent. After having picked out the referent
of a description D. we may still not not know who the D is. On the
other hand, we may know who or what the description denotes, for
example, by knowing some &amp;quot;standard name&amp;quot; for it, and yet be unable
to use that knowledge to pick out the object. For example, if we ask
&amp;quot;Which is the Seattle train?&amp;quot; and receive the reply &amp;quot;It&apos;s train number
11689, we may still not be able to pick out and board the train if its
serial number is not plainly in view.
Finally, athough not stated in this definition, the means by which
the act is performed is some function mapping D to some procedure
that, when executed by Agt, enables Agt to discover the X that is
the referent of D.

4.1. Requesting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996954461538461">
Con4ider what it takes to make a request. Hector Levesque and I
14, 31 argue that requests and other illocutionary acts can be defined
in terms of interacting plans â€” i.e., as beliefs about the conversants&apos;
shared knowledge of the speaker&apos;s goals and the causal consequences
of achieving those goals. In this formalism, illocutionary acts are no
longer conceptually primitive, but rather amount to theorems that can
be proven about a state of affairs. The proof requires an axiomatiza-
tion of agents beliefs, expectations, goals, plans, actions, and a cor-
relation of utterance mood with certain propositional attitudes. The
important point here is that the definition of a request is not merely
stipulated, but is derived from an independently motivated theory of
action. Any act that brings about the right effects in the right way
satisfies the request theorem.
Briefly, a request is an action (or collection of actions) that makes
it (1) shared knowledge that the speaker&apos;s goal is that the hearer thinks
the speaker wants the hearer to adopt the goal of doing a particular
act, thereby making it (2) shared knowledge between the speaker and
hearer that the speaker wants the hearer to do that act. This inference
requires an additional &amp;quot;gating&amp;quot; condition that it be shared knowledge
that the speaker is both sincere and can perform the requested act
(i.e., he knows how, and the preconditions of that act are true).
The processing of an utterance is assumed to begin by applying
the propositional attitude correlated with its mood to the proposi-
tional content associated with its literal interpretation. Thus, corre-
lated with imperatives and interrogatives is the attitude above (corre-
sponding to goal (1)): 6

(DONE Hearer Act P) is true if Hearer has done act Act
and has brought about P. For yes/no interrogatives, Act would be
an INFORMIF 1111; for imperatives, it would be the act mentioned
in the sentence. Declaratives would be correlated with a different
propositional attitude. Beginning with the utterance-correlated atti-
tudes, a derivation process that constitutes plan-recognition reasoning
determines what the speaker meant 171. Thus, for example, what the
speaker meant could be classified as a request if the derivation included
making (2) true by making the above formula true.
An act may simultaneously achieve the goals constituting more
than one illocutionary act. This ability underlies the analysis of indi-
rect speech acts. Formalisms have been developed 15, 111 that describe
when we can conclude, from a speaker&apos;s wanting the hearer to want
the precondition of some act to hold, (or wanting the hearer to be-
lieve the precondition does hold), that the speaker wants the hearer
to adopt the goal of performing the act. The conditions licensing this
inference are that it be mutually known that the act (or its effect) is
an expected goal or the speaker, and that it be mutually known that:
the hearer can perform the act, is cooperative, and does not want not
to do it.
Returning to the troublesome existential sentences, this pattern
of reasoning, which I term the &amp;quot;illocutionary act analysis&amp;quot; (IAA), can
be used to derive a request for referent identification. The reasoning is
similar to that needed to infer a request to open the door on hearing
a speaker, with two arm-loads of groceries, say &amp;quot;the door is closed&amp;quot;.
The general form of this reasoning involves the assertion of an action&apos;s
precondition when the effect of the action is an expected goal of the
speaker. In the case at hand, the speaker&apos;s existential assertion causes
the hearer to believe the existential precondition of the referent iden-
tification act, since speaker and hearer both think they are talking
about objects in front of the hearer, and because the description is
identifiable. Hence, the hearer concludes Ile is intended to pick out its
referent. The hearer may go on to infer that he is intended to perform
other acts, such as to pick up the object. This inference process also
indicates when the indirect request interpretation is not intended, for
example, if it is mutually known that the description is not identifi-
able, or if it is mutually known that time hearer would not want to
identify the referent.
I argue that this kind of reasoning underlies the propositional act
account. First, I show that Searle&apos;s conditions on referring are a special
case of the conditions for requesting referent identification. Then, I
show that if one extends the definition of IDENTIFY-REFERENT
to cover Searle&apos;s more general concept of identification, the IAA is
applicable in the same circumstances as Searle&apos;s analysis. Because the
IAA is independently motivated and covers more cases, it should be
preferred.

requested action (i.e., IDENTIFIED-REFERENT) by way of commu-
nicating (in the Gricean sense) his intent that the hearer perform the
action, provided that it is shared knowledge that the hearer can do
the action. The last condition is true if it is shared knowledge that the
the precondition to the action holds, which includes Searle&apos;s existen-
tial Condition 1. Searle&apos;s Condition 5 states that the speaker intends
to identify he referent to the hearer. This condition is captured in
the IAA by its becoming mutual knowledge that the speaker intends
to achieve the effect of the referent identification act, IDENTIFIED-
REFERENT. Finally, Searle&apos;s Gricean intent recognition Condition
(6) takes hold in the same way that it does for other illocutionary
acts. namely in virtue of a &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; of the utterance (e.g., utter-
ance mood, or a definite determiner) that is correlated with a complex
propositional attitude. This attitude becomes the basis for subsequent
reasoning about the speaker&apos;s plans. In summary, Searle&apos;s conditions
can be accounted for by simply positing an action that the speaker
requests and that the hearer reasons about and performs.
So far, the IAA and PAA are complementary. They each account
for different aspects of referring. The IAA characterizes utterances
whose sole purpose is to secure referent identification, and the PAA
characterizes the use of referring phrases within an illocutionary act.
I now procede to show how the IAA can subsume the PAA.
Searle argues that one use of the definite article in uttering an
NP is to indirate the speaker&apos;s intention to refer uniquely. Moreover,
from Condition 5, this intention is supposed to be recognized by the
hearer. We can get this effect by correlating the following expression
with the definite deterniiner:

<bodyText confidence="0.998012333333333">
Think of this expression as being a pragmatic &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; of a syn-
tactic constituent, as in current linguistic formalisms. When this ex-
pression is applied to a descriptor (supplied from the semantics of the
NP) we have a complete formula that becomes the seed for deriving
a request. Namely, if it is mutually believed the speaker is sincere, 7
then it is 11111 Wally believed there is a unique object that speaker wants
the hearer to want to pick out. If it is mutually believed the hearer
can do it (i.e.. the preconditions to the referent identification act hold,
and the hearer knows how to do it by decomposing the description
into a plan of action). it is mutually believed of some object that the
speaker&apos;s goal is that the hearer actually pick it out. Hence, a request.

Using the propositional act of referring. Searle argues against Rus-
sell&apos;s (13) theory of descriptions, which holds that the uttering of an
expression &amp;quot;the 0&amp;quot; is equivalent to the assertion of an uniquely exis-
tential proposition &amp;quot;there is a unique 0&amp;quot;. Thus, when reference fails,
it is because the uniquely existential proposition is not true. Searle
claims instead that the existence of the referent is a precondition to
the action of referring. In referring to X, we do not assert that X exists
any more than we do in hitting X (/bid, p. However, the pre-
condition is necessary for successful performance. Searle&apos;s argument
against this theory essentially comes down to:
... It (Russell&apos;s theory) presents the propositional act of
definite reference, when performed with definite descrip-
tions ... as equivalent to the illocutionary act of assert-
ing a uniquely existential proposition, and there is no
coherent way to integrate such a theory into a theory of
illocutionary acts. Under no condition is a propositional
act identical with the illocutionary act of assertion, for
a propositional act can only occur as part of sonic illo-
cutionary act, never simply by itself (Ibid, p.
There are two difficulties with this argument. First, the require-
ment that acts of referring be part of an illocutionary act was shown
to be unnecessarily restrictive. Second, there is a way to assimilate
the assertion of an existential proposition - - an act that Searle claims
does not contain a referring act â€” into an analysis of illocutionary
acts, namely as an indirect request for referent identification. How-
ever, because an assertion of a uniquely existential proposition may
fail to convey an indirect request for referent identification (just as
uttering &amp;quot;It&apos;s cold in here&amp;quot; may fail to convey out indirect request)
Searle&apos;s argument, though weakened, still stands.

There are a number of advantages for treating referent identifi-
cation as an action that speakers request. and thus for treating the
speech act of referring as a request. The analysis not iinly accounts
for data that Searle&apos;s account cannot. but it also predicts each of
Searle&apos;s conditions for performing the act of singular identifying refer-
ence, yet it allows for appropriate extension into a planning process. If
we extend the perceptual use of referent identification to Searle&apos;s more
general concept of identification, and we correlate a certain (Cricean)
propositional attitude with the use of definite detertniners in a noun
phrase, then Searle&apos;s analysis is subsumed by the act of requesting
referent identification. The propositional act of referriag is therefore
unnecessary.
The promissory note introduced by this approach is to show
how the same kind of plan-based reasoning used in analyzing indi-
rect speech acts can take hold when a hearer realizes lie cannot, and
was not intended to, identify the referent of a description. That is,
plan-based reasoning should explain how a hearer might decide that
the speaker&apos;s intention cannot be what it appears to be (based on the
intent correlated with the use of a definite determiner), leading him, for
example, to decide to treat a description attributively (6). Moreover,
such reasoning should be useful in determining intended referents, as

Ortony 1101 has argued.
To keep this promise, we need to be specific about speaker-
intentions for other uses of noun phrases. This will be no easy task.
One difficulty will be to capture the distinction between achieving ef-
fects on a hearer, and doing so communicatively (i.e., in the Gricean
way). Thus, for example, a hearer cannot comply with the illocution-
ary force of &amp;quot;Quick, don&apos;t think of an elephant&amp;quot; because there seems to
be an &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot; process of &amp;quot;concept activation&amp;quot; Ill. Achieving ef-
fects non-communicatively, i.e., without the recognition of intent, may
be central to some kinds of reference. In such cases, speakers would
be able to identify referents for a hearer. If this held for singular iden-
tifying reference, then there could be grounds for a propositional act.
However, we might have to give up the Gricean condition (5), which I
suspect Searle would not want to (10.
Finally, there are obviously many aspects of reference that need
to be accounted for by any comprehensive theory. I make no claims
(yet) about the utility of the present approach for dealing with them.
Rather, I hope to have opened the door to a formal pragmatics for one

The proof requires an axiomatization of agents beliefs, expectations, goals, plans, actions, and a correlation of utterance mood with certain propositional attitudes. The important point here is that the definition of a request is not merely stipulated, but is derived from an independently motivated theory of action. Any act that brings about the right effects in the right way satisfies the request theorem. Briefly, a request is an action (or collection of actions) that makes it (1) shared knowledge that the speaker&apos;s goal is that the hearer thinks the speaker wants the hearer to adopt the goal of doing a particular act, thereby making it (2) shared knowledge between the speaker and hearer that the speaker wants the hearer to do that act. This inference requires an additional &amp;quot;gating&amp;quot; condition that it be shared knowledge that the speaker is both sincere and can perform the requested act (i.e., he knows how, and the preconditions of that act are true).

If one extends the perceptuallybased notion of referent identification to include Searle&apos;s concept of identification, then by associating a complex propositional attitude to one use of the definite determiner, a request can be derived. The IAA thus handles the referring use of definite noun phrases with independently motivated rules. Referring becomes a kind of requesting. Hence, the propositional act of referring is unnecessary. 2. Referring as a propositional speech act Revising Austin&apos;s [2] locutionary/illocutionary dichotomy, Searle distinguishes between illocutionary acts (lAs) and propositional acts (PAs) of referring and predicating. Both kinds of acts are performed in making an utterance, but propositional acts can only be performed in the course of performing some illocutionary act. Let us consider Searle&apos;s rules for referring, which I term the &amp;quot;propositional act analysis&amp;quot;, or PAA.

The last condition is true if it is shared knowledge that the the precondition to the action holds, which includes Searle&apos;s existential Condition 1. Searle&apos;s Condition 5 states that the speaker intends to identify he referent to the hearer. This condition is captured in the IAA by its becoming mutual knowledge that the speaker intends to achieve the effect of the referent identification act, IDENTIFIEDREFERENT. Finally, Searle&apos;s Gricean intent recognition Condition (6) takes hold in the same way that it does for other illocutionary acts. namely in virtue of a &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; of the utterance (e.g., utterance mood, or a definite determiner) that is correlated with a complex propositional attitude. This attitude becomes the basis for subsequent reasoning about the speaker&apos;s plans. In summary, Searle&apos;s conditions can be accounted for by simply positing an action that the speaker requests and that the hearer reasons about and performs.

Because both accounts are equally vague on what constitutes identification (as are, for that matter, all other accounts of which I am aware), the choice between them must rest on other grounds. The grounds favoring the identification request analysis include the use of separate utterances and illocutionary acts for referring, and the independently motivated satisfaction of Searle&apos;s conditions on referring. 5.2. Searle vs. Russell Using the propositional act of referring. Searle argues against Russell&apos;s (13) theory of descriptions, which holds that the uttering of an expression &amp;quot;the 0&amp;quot; is equivalent to the assertion of an uniquely existential proposition &amp;quot;there is a unique 0&amp;quot;. Thus, when reference fails, it is because the uniquely existential proposition is not true. Searle claims instead that the existence of the referent is a precondition to the action of referring. In referring to X, we do not assert that X exists any more than we do in hitting X (/bid, p. However, the precondition is necessary for successful performance.
