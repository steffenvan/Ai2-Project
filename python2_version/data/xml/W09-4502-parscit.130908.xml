<bodyText confidence="0.999870625">
Semantic Technologies and the Semantic Web (SW) as the
embodiment of know-how for practical usage of these
technologies are widely discussed, and it is already clear
that semantic content available within knowledge portals
shall lead us to a new generation of the Internet and
knowledge intensive applications [1].
Medicine should be considered among the top domains
for Semantic Web and intelligent applications due to high
(and increasing) volumes of health-related information
presented in both unstructured and machine readable form
[2, 3, 4, 5].
The aim of this paper is to present one particular
approach to this task – the Ontos solution for the Semantic
Web in the medical domain. Two types of web applications
(semantic portals) are examined, as well as the technology
which underlies them.

2.1 General Remarks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999890625">
One of the main goals of the Semantic Web is
“semantizing” the content which already exists within the
classic WWW, and of the new content created each day.
Significantly, the semantic representation of processed
content should be suitable for usage by program agents
oriented at solving customers’ tasks. To support customers&apos;
activities within the Semantic Web we need common
processing platforms with, at least, three key components:

<listItem confidence="0.996542">
• Knowledge Extractor based on powerful information
extraction methods and tools (multilingual, effective
and easily scalable).
• Knowledge Warehouse based on the RDF, OWL,
SPARQL standards (effective and scalable).
• Set of customer oriented Semantic Services (Semantic
Navigation, Semantic Digesting and Summarization,
Knowledge-Based Analytics, etc.).

<bodyText confidence="0.9991573">
Semantic Content within the Semantic Web framework can
be viewed as a new kind of “raw material”, which serves as
input for Semantic Services that process it and present the
results to customers [6, 7].
The Ontos Service Oriented Architecture (Ontos SOA)
and an appropriate software platform were developed to
support these aspects of Semantic Technologies within the
Ontos solution.
The general workflow within the Ontos Solution is
illustrated below.

text documents. These are then fed as input to the
OntosMiner linguistic processors, which are discussed in
sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. The output of these processors is a
semantic graph (in RDF/XML, OWL, Turtle or N3 format)
which represents named entities and relations recognized in
the input text.
This graph is then stored in the knowledge base, where
incoming knowledge is integrated with existing data (see
section 2.2.4).
The data in the knowledge base is accessed by various
web-oriented semantic applications, which were designed to
provide end users with interesting and powerful services
based on semantic metadata (see section 3).
</bodyText>

2.2.2 Information Extraction with Systems of the
OntosMiner Family
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999255469387755">
Generally speaking, each IE-system of the OntosMiner
family takes as input a plain text written in a natural
language and returns a set of annotations, which are
themselves sets of feature-value correspondences. These
output annotations represent the objects and relations which
the processor was able to extract from the text.
The basic structure of OntosMiner linguistic processors
is based on the well-known GATE architecture [8]. Each
OntosMiner linguistic processor consists of a set of
specialized modules called &apos;resources&apos; which are organized
into &apos;resource chains&apos;. In this chain the resources are
launched one after another and each subsequent resource
has access to the output of previously launched resources.
The first three basic resources are the Tokenizer, the
Morphological Analyzer, and the Gazetteer. The Tokenizer
determines word boundaries based on formal features of the
text, the Morphological Analyzer generates a set of possible
variants of morphological analysis for each word, and the
Gazetteer annotates key words and key phrases which are
later used for the recognition of named entities and
relations. These three modules - prepare the input for the
two main modules of the system - the Named Entity
Extractor and the Relation Extractor.
In the domain of named entity recognition we have
adopted the rule-based approach to NLP which means that
named entities are identified according to rules defined by
developers. Thus, the Named Entity Extractor consists of a
set of rules divided into subsets called &apos;phases&apos; which are
applied sequentially to the annotation set. Rules from each
subsequent phase have access to the output of rules in
previous phases. Each rule consists of a pattern on the
annotation set and a sequence of commands which define
the action that has to be performed when the pattern is
encountered. The pattern is written in the Jape+ language,
which is an extended version of the Jape language
developed by the Natural Language Processing Group at
the University of Sheffield [8]. The action parts of rules are
mostly written in Java.
The list of possible keys for named entity recognition
includes the key words and phrases annotated by the
Gazetteer module, as well as annotations generated by
previous phases of the Named Entity Extractor, and even
specific features of annotations. For instance, the fact that a
word begins with an upper case letter can play a significant
role in the recognition of proper names in languages like
English and French.
Typically, the system of rules for the recognition of a
certain type of named entity comprises several dozens of
rules which &apos;build&apos; the target annotations through a number
of intermediate steps.
One of the main difficulties with the rule based
approach that we adopt is the emergence of conflicts
between different rules. For instance, one set of rules within
the Named Entity Extractor can identify a certain text
fragment as part of a person&apos;s name, while a different set of
rules identifies it as part of a company name. We
discovered that when the number of rules involved grows
beyond one hundred, it becomes increasingly difficult to try
to control for such conflicts within the rule system itself.
This is why in OntosMiner processors we allow the rules
for named entity extraction to apply freely, but complement
the Named Entity Extractor with a special module called
Minimizer which defines the policies for conflict resolution.
The idea is that different rules have a varying measure of
reliability and that the developer can evaluate this measure
for each rule, stating it as a feature of the annotation created
by this rule.
Thus, annotations generated by the Named Entity
Extractor come with a feature called &apos;Weight&apos; which has an
integer value ranging from 0 to 100. This feature reflects the
probability (as estimated by the developer) that this
annotation is correct. The Minimizer resource contains a set
of rules which describe different types of conflict and define
which annotations should survive and which should be
deleted, based on the types of annotations involved in the
conflict and their weights. The resulting &apos;minimized&apos;
annotation set is passed on to the Relation Extractor.
Semantic relations are certain facts or situations
mentioned in the input text which relate one named entity
to another, such as information about a person&apos;s
employment in a company, or, in the medical domain, the
fact that a certain condition can be the side-effect of a
certain medicine. The module which is responsible for the
recognition of semantic relations in OntosMiner processors
is the Relation Extractor. Just like the Named Entity
Extractor, the Relation Extractor contains a set of rules
written in Jape+ and Java, grouped into a sequence of
phases.
Recognition of semantic relations differs from the
recognition of named entities in that named entities are
expressed by compact word groups, while the keys for
semantic relations can be situated quite far apart from each
other within one sentence or within the whole text. This is
why in developing rules for relation recognition we exploit
a different strategy: we reduce the set of annotations which
is fed as input to the rules, so that it includes only key
words and phrases needed to identify a particular relation,
and conversely, &apos;stop-words&apos; and &apos;stop-phrases&apos; which
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989642">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999344941176471">
should never interfere between the keys. All other
annotations are not included into the input and are not
&apos;visible&apos; to the rules.
Another method that we found to be sometimes very
effective in relation extraction is to first divide the input
texts into meaningful fragments, and then to process each
type of fragment with a separate set of rules. This technique
proves useful when we are dealing with semi-structured
input texts, such as drug descriptions (see below on the
MedTrust portal). We can use a different set of rules for
each sub-section of the description, which leads to an
improvement in both precision and recall.
A distinguished type of relation is the relation
&apos;TheSame&apos; (also called the &apos;identification relation&apos;) which is
established between two co-referring occurrences of a
named entity within a text. The resource which establishes
relations of this type is called OntosCoreferencer. This
resource builds a matrix of all the relevant annotations and
compares them two by two to establish whether the
annotations in each pair can count as two co-referring
occurrences or not.
The final resource in the resource chain of every
OntosMiner processor is the Triples Converter. This
module takes as input the set of annotations created by
previous modules and generates an output in the form of
an RDF/XML, OWL, Turtle or N3 document. During its
work the Triples Converter accesses the OntosMiner
Domains Description database (see below) and replaces all
the names of annotations generated by the OntosMiner
processor with the names of corresponding concepts and
relations of the Domain Ontology, using the mapping rules
defined in the Mapping Ontology. All the OntosMiner
annotations for which mapping rules have not been
defined, are excluded from the output.

2.2.3 Ontological Engineering
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9873703">
It is well known that the ontological engineering is one of
the core processes in the life cycle of semantic-oriented
applications. Today there exists a number of
methodologies, technologies and tools supporting this
activity [9]. An overwhelming majority of them is oriented
at creating and maintaining domain ontologies, and doesn&apos;t
have anything in common with editing linguistic
dictionaries or developing natural language processors.
However, on the conceptual level, configuring a
linguistic processor or a system of linguistic dictionaries
may also be viewed upon as a new domain, which in its turn
may be modeled by an ontology or a system of ontologies.
The system of ontologies which determines the work of
OntosMiner processors is called OntosMiner Domains
Description (OMDD). On the physical level OMDD is the
data which is uploaded to an RDF based triplestore
(OMDD database). Ontological data in the OMDD is stored
in a format which is completely compatible with OWL.
Generally speaking, OMDD is a system of ontologies
which can be divided into 6 classes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997313285714286">
• Domain ontologies (concepts and relations which are
relevant for a certain domain). Domain ontologies are
interconnected by relations of inheritance.
• Internal ontologies (sets of annotation types, features and
possible feature values used in specific OntosMiner
processors).
• Dictionary ontologies (morphological dictionaries and
dictionaries of key words and phrases).
• Resource ontologies (sequences of text processing
resources which are used by OntosMiner processors).
• Mapping ontologies (mappings which ensure that
concepts from the internal ontology are correctly
replaced with concepts from the domain ontology).
• Other (auxiliary) ontologies.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.896358">
The current OMDD contains about 120 ontologies
(around 2,5 million triples).

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.999575">
2.2.4 Ontos Semantic Knowledge Base
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998235">
The Ontos Semantic Knowledge Base is one of the core
components within the Ontos solution. Its main function is
to provide effective storage of the RDF-graph which
accumulates all the information extracted from large
collections of texts by OntoMiner processors. Data in the
Knowledge Base can be accessed via queries in the
SPARQL query language.
At the moment, we have two implementation of the
Knowledge Base – one based on RDMS Oracle 11g and
another one based on Open Source libraries and platforms
for the implementation of RDF-stores.
A crucial problem in this regard is the presence of
duplicate objects (i.e. objects that represent the same real
world entities) within the accumulated RDF graph. The task
of merging such instances is performed by algorithms of
object identification which take into account the whole set
of an object&apos;s identifying features, including information
about its attributes and relations.

The presented Ontos solution presumes two modes of
access for external users: either the accumulated semantic
content can be accessed via our own implemented semantic
applications, or semantic content can be provided for use by
third-party applications via an API.
Our own solutions [10, 11] based on semantic content
include packages for Nanomedicine and Pharmacology.

The main goals of “semantizing” NL-content are related to
integrating pieces of information, identifying implicit
connections, and providing the possibility to receive an
object&apos;s profile, to find out trends, etc. All these issues are
particularly important for innovative fields such as
Nanomedicine.

3.1.1 Information Sources and Domain Models
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990726">
In order to make it possible to carry out a full-scale analysis
of different aspects of any innovative field, one should
integrate information from a variety of sources of different
structure and content. The relevant information sources can
include (but are not limited to) the following ones:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999105">
• Patent collections;
• Databases with descriptions of international projects and
programmes;
• Conference materials and scientific papers;
• Blogs and forums in the specific domain;
• Regulatory documents;
• Opinion letters of analytical companies;
• Internet portals, news in technology, RSS feeds.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998746923076923">
It is also worth mentioning that the most interesting
data can be extracted from multilingual document
collections, allowing users, above all, to form a view of the
situation on an international scale.
The ontological system used for knowledge extraction
in the Ontos Nanomedicine solution is based on a
combination of ontologies corresponding to specific
domains and information sources. This means that each
particular ontology contains concepts and relations relevant
for the domain and typical for the specific source (e.g.
“Inventors” and “Assignees” for Patent analysis). The
system of domain models which underlies the portal is
presented below in Table 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.9978906">
All the domain ontologies are language independent.
This means that the NLP modules for any language relevant
for the project are driven by the same ontologies. Language
specificity is taken into consideration at the level of
linguistic rules and linguistic (dictionary) ontologies.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.994996">
3.1.2 Semantic Portal’s Functionalities
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999745027777778">
The portal includes the following sections:
News/Monitoring. This page is meant for on-line
monitoring of the sources which are considered to be
relevant. Objects and relations are extracted which makes it
possible to form ratings, illustrate trends, and determine
semantic focuses of the processed documents. A
multilingual thesaurus is integrated into the page. Filtering
by categories, sources, object types, etc. is provided.
Experts. Companies and Institutions. Shadow
groups. For the most part, the content for these sections is
related to patents, scientific papers, PhD theses, and
conference materials. OntosMiner extracts information
about inventors, authors and co-authors, assignees,
affiliations, etc. This allows users to find experts and
leaders in the domain of their interest, as well as to look for
shadow groups of people and institutions working in the
domain, based on thesauri and objects of interest.
Analytics. “My Objects” analysis. These sections
provide BI tools for presenting a variety of views on the
data stored in the Knowledge Base. Pie-charts, column
diagrams, matrices help users to discover trends, areas of
concentration of financial, intellectual and other resources,
find out lacunae, etc. Own Ontos tools as well as third-party
instruments can be used for presenting information in this
section. “My Objects” functionality allows users to form
personalized collections of objects, which are stored in user
profiles, so that one can monitor their visibility in the media
and their public image, compare their ratings, discover the
most interesting statements about them, etc.
GIS. Graph Navigation. The GIS section is designed
for representing objects and facts from the Knowledge Base
on geographic maps (Semantic GIS). Graph Navigation
gives access to all objects and relations in the Knowledge
Base, allowing users to discover connections between
objects starting from an object of interest, with the
possibility to filter relations by type, relevance, etc. (Fig. 2).

3.1.3 Semantic Wiki, Bookmarking and Navigation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983157894737">
The portal is based on the wiki-engine, since one of its
purposes is to create an environment for the community of
experts. This functionality is in harmony with the Semantic
Wiki approach. Initially the content of wiki-pages is
generated automatically based on the accumulated semantic
metadata. Later, these data can be supplemented manually
by users in the standard wiki fashion by experts with
sufficient access rights. Semantic bookmarking tools are
also integrated into these wiki-pages [12].
Inside the original information sources (i.e. web
pages), one can switch on the so-called Semantic
Navigation option by installing a special plug-in which
superimposes semantic metadata upon the original content.
Superficially, this looks similar to standard hypertext, but
the functionality is different. Once the user clicks on a
highlighted object a navigation card appears, which delivers
accumulated information on the object&apos;s features and
relations, and provides the possibility to navigate through
the semantic graph starting from this object.

3.2 Semantic Portal MedTrust
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953263157895">
Another application of Ontos solutions in biomedical
domain called MedTrust system was designed for non-
professional users looking for impartial information in
pharmacology, as well as for physicians prescribing drugs
to their patients. This application isn&apos;t claimed to be an
expert system and is not aimed at giving ready-to-use
recommendations. The aim of this application is to provide
users with information integrated from a number of trusted
sources containing pharmacological data thus giving them
opportunity to receive full and detailed information related
to their health conditions and prescriptions in one place.
This is especially important when a patient has several
health problems and is treated by several physicians, each
of them prescribing medications according to his or her
specialization. The aim of the system is to make users pay
attention to possible incompatibilities, contra-indications
and side effects taking place as a result of taking several
type of medicine at the same time, or taking a certain
medicine when having a certain health condition.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.994595">
3.2.1 Domain Model
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999278571428571">
The domain model for the MedTrust system is focused on
the concept Medicine (drug, preparation). It was initially
prepared by professional physicians from the Russian State
Medical University (RSMU).
The next task was to transform this model into an
ontology which would conform to the standards adopted
within the Ontos solution.
The main sections within drug descriptions are mostly
common for different pharmacological resources and
include the following data: Latin name, Composition and
Form, Pharmacological Action, Pharmacokinetics,
Indications, Pregnancy and lactation, Contraindications,
Side effects, Special Notes, Medical Interaction,
Overdosage, Doses, Storage conditions, Expiration date,
Registration number, Analogues, Active ingredients,
Manufacturer, Pharmacological groups, ATC classification,
Therapeutic class.
This information is represented either in the form of
attributes or in the form of relations in the domain ontology.
Types of objects include Preparation, State/Condition,
Symptom, Syndrome, Treatment Method, etc.

A special OntosMiner processor based on this domain
ontology was applied to over 10000 texts, including both
drug descriptions and unstructured NL-texts about
symptoms, syndromes and diseases. The results were
accumulated in a knowledge base, which is then accessed
via the user interface.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.999555">
3.2.3 User Interfaces
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970352941177">
User interface is implemented as a portal with a variety of
sections including a pharmacological guide. There are two
types of semantic services integrated into the portal, one is
related to semantic navigation (see section 3.1.3), another
one is provided in a form of a query interface. In the latter
interface, there are several predefined query types, for
instance &amp;quot;Which preparations are contra-indicated in case
of listed health states/conditions?&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Are the listed
preparations compatible?&amp;quot;.
For obtaining complete and detailed information on
preparations, one can use search by active ingredients. One
can also use search by states’ synonyms. Different search
methods can be used individually or simultaneously.
The navigation service gives more information on
selected preparations and conditions. The provided
information is organized according to the domain model.
However, the navigation service is not so strictly focused

In this paper we have presented the Ontos solution for the
Semantic Web in Nanomedicine and Pharmacology
domains. This solution is based on automated processing of
large multilingual collections of natural language texts,
gathered from Internet resources and corporate databases.
This process is controlled by ontological representations of
the domains of interest. The output of this analysis is
represented in standard formats and stored in an RDF
Knowledge Base, where data is merged and accumulated.
Finally, we described Semantic Web Applications which
are based on this accumulated semantic content.

These output annotations represent the objects and relations which the processor was able to extract from the text. The basic structure of OntosMiner linguistic processors is based on the well-known GATE architecture [8]. Each OntosMiner linguistic processor consists of a set of specialized modules called &apos;resources&apos; which are organized into &apos;resource chains&apos;. In this chain the resources are launched one after another and each subsequent resource has access to the output of previously launched resources. The first three basic resources are the Tokenizer, the Morphological Analyzer, and the Gazetteer. The Tokenizer determines word boundaries based on formal features of the text, the Morphological Analyzer generates a set of possible variants of morphological analysis for each word, and the Gazetteer annotates </context>

Thus, the Named Entity Extractor consists of a set of rules divided into subsets called &apos;phases&apos; which are applied sequentially to the annotation set. Rules from each subsequent phase have access to the output of rules in previous phases. Each rule consists of a pattern on the annotation set and a sequence of commands which define the action that has to be performed when the pattern is encountered. The pattern is written in the Jape+ language, which is an extended version of the Jape language developed by the Natural Language Processing Group at the University of Sheffield [8]. The action parts of rules are mostly written in Java. The list of possible keys for named entity recognition includes the key words and phrases annotated by the Gazetteer module, as well as annotations generated by previous phases of the Named Entity Extractor, and even specific features of annotations. For instance, the fact that a word begins with an upper case letter can play a significant role in the recognition of proper names in languages like English and French. Typically, the system of rules for the recognition of a certain type of named entity comprises several dozens of rules which</context>

All the OntosMiner annotations for which mapping rules have not been defined, are excluded from the output. 2.2.3 Ontological Engineering It is well known that the ontological engineering is one of the core processes in the life cycle of semantic-oriented applications. Today there exists a number of methodologies, technologies and tools supporting this activity [9]. An overwhelming majority of them is oriented at creating and maintaining domain ontologies, and doesn&apos;t have anything in common with editing linguistic dictionaries or developing natural language processors. However, on the conceptual level, configuring a linguistic processor or a system of linguistic dictionaries may also be viewed upon as a new domain, which in its turn may be modeled by an ontology or a system of ontologies. The system of ontologies which determines the work of OntosMiner processors is called OntosMiner Domains Description (OMDD). On the physical level OMDD is the data wh</context>

Widgets within the Ontos Semantic Applications 3.1.3 Semantic Wiki, Bookmarking and Navigation The portal is based on the wiki-engine, since one of its purposes is to create an environment for the community of experts. This functionality is in harmony with the Semantic Wiki approach. Initially the content of wiki-pages is generated automatically based on the accumulated semantic metadata. Later, these data can be supplemented manually by users in the standard wiki fashion by experts with sufficient access rights. Semantic bookmarking tools are also integrated into these wiki-pages [12]. Inside the original information sources (i.e. web pages), one can switch on the so-called Semantic Navigation option by installing a special plug-in which superimposes semantic metadata upon the original content. Superficially, this looks similar to standard hypertext, but the functionality is different. Once the user clicks on a highlighted object a navigation card appears, which delivers accumulated information on the object&apos;s features and relations, and provides the possibility to navigate through the semantic graph starting from this object. 3.2 Semantic Portal MedTrust Another applicati</context>
