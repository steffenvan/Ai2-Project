In this paper we explain how we anno-
tated subordinators in the Turkish Dis-
course Bank (TDB), an effort that started
in 2007 and is still continuing. We in-
troduce the project and describe some of
the issues that were important in anno-
tating three subordinators, namely kars¸ın,
ra˘gmen and halde, all of which encode the
coherence relation Contrast-Concession.
We also describe the annotation tool.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.995105576923077">
The Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is a project
initiated by the joint effort of a group of re-
searchers in Turkey. The project builds on an ex-
isting corpus, namely the METU Turkish Corpus
(MTC) (Say et al., 2002), and extends it to a dis-
course level resource by following the principles
of the PDTB (Prasad et al., 2007) in annotating
discourse connectives and their arguments. The 2-
million-word MTC contains 520 continuous texts
from various genres written between 1991-2000.
From a semantic perspective, we take discourse
connectives as predicates that take as their argu-
ments tensed or untensed clauses with abstract ob-
ject interpretations. Abstract objects are proposi-
tions, facts, events, situations, etc. (Asher, 1993).
Connectives themselves may be realized explicitly
or implicitly (Halliday, 1985; Prasad et al., 2007).
Explicit connectives are simple or complex lexi-
cal items that encode a discourse relation, while
implicit connectives can be inferred from related
text spans that have coherence relations. The TDB
project aims to annotate explicit connectives only.
In Turkish, discourse connectives are identified
with three syntactic categories (Zeyrek and Web-
ber, 2008): (a) Coordinating conjunctions (b) Sub-
ordinators (c) Discourse adverbials (or anaphoric

connectives). All these discourse connectives have
two and only two arguments, which are conve-
niently labeled as ARG1 and ARG2.1 ARG2 is
always the argument that syntactically hosts the
connective.
The ARG1/ARG2 organization of discourse
connectives is consistent with the following ob-
servations in discourse: Sentences in discourse
are coherently related, and therefore when ex-
plicit discourse connectives are used, if they are
really discourse connectives, they are bound to
set up a relation between a consequent clause and
its antecedent. (Note that the ARG2 designation
does not imply that ARG2 is consequent or an-
tecedent.) In certain cases presupposition needs a
mediator, viz. the discourse connective. Noncon-
nectival discourse relations are certainly possible,
but connective-engendered discourse relations are
claimed to be more specific about their semantics,
e.g. they bring about presuppositional meaning
(van der Sandt, 1992; Webber et al., 1999).
In this regard, the ARG1/ARG2 classification is
unlike syntactic subcategorization, which is a lex-
ical property of functors (e.g. verbs) which are
not necessarily presuppositional and hence they
can differ in arbitrary ways (ditransitive, transitive,
unergative, unaccusative etc.).

3 Subordinating Conjunctions in
Turkish: A Brief Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999565111111111">
Subordinators have two subtypes. Converbs are
suffixes attached directly to verb roots. For exam-
ple, the suffix -(y)ArAk ‘by (means of)’ requires
as its ARG2 a nominalized adverbial clause as in
(1). Complex subordinators, e.g. ra˘gmen ‘despite,
although’, kars¸ın ‘although’, halde ‘despite, along
with’, ic¸in causal ‘since’, purposive ‘so as to’, etc.
mostly take case-marked nominalized clauses as
their ARG2.

In this paper, we will not deal with converbs.
We will also not deal with connectives taking as
their ARG2 a finite clause because none of these
subtypes have been annotated yet. We will focus
on three postpositions taking a nominalized clause
as ARG2, namely ra˘gmen, kars¸ın and halde, all of
which encode the Contrast-Concession relation.
In the PDTB, such clauses were not annotated as
arguments. However, in Turkish, they are so com-
mon as arguments of subordinators that we would
have missed an important property of Turkish dis-
course if we did not annotate them. In the rest
of the paper, we provide examples taken from the
MTC. We underline the connective, show ARG2
in bold letters and render ARG1 in italics.

3.1 The minimality principle
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999523">
As in the PDTB, the minimality principle is in-
voked, according to which clauses, parts of clauses
or sentences that are minimally necessary and suf-
ficient for the discourse relation engendered by
the connective are annotated as ARG1 or ARG2
(Prasad et al., 2007). Any other text span that
is perceived to be important for the interpretation
of the discourse relation can be selected as sup-
plementary information in addition to ARG1 or
ARG2.

3.2 Morphological properties of the

arguments and their relative ordering
In Turkish, subordinate clauses are essentially
nominalizations, which may be formed by -DIK
or -mA suffixes (the factive nominal and the action
nominal, respectively (Kornfilt, 1997)).
Two of the connectives, i.e. ra˘gmen and kars¸ın
expect action nominals, the person agreement suf-
fix, and the dative suffix -(y)A on their ARG2. On
the other hand, the connective halde expects a fac-
tive nominal and the person agreement suffix. In
the examples below, we show these suffixes with
glosses on the English translations.
The arguments of subordinators are necessarily
adjacent and mostly exhibit the ARG2-ARG1 or-
der because Turkish is a left-branching language
and subordinate clauses are on the left in canonical
order. ARG2 can be postposed for backgrounding
purposes or to express new and unexpected infor-
mation, as in (2).

3.3 Issues in annotating the arguments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967555555556">
One of the challenges we have faced so far is the
question of how to annotate connectives which are
themselves a converb suffix (e.g. -(y)ArAk, as in
(1)) or postpositions that choose a case-marked
ARG2 as in (2). In both cases, we decided to an-
notate ARG2 by selecting the clause without sepa-
rating the suffixes. In this way, we would not inter-
fere with the annotators’ intuitions since we would
not be demanding them to have conscious knowl-
edge of the morphological constraints on the ar-
guments. This style of annotation was welcomed
by the annotators. When all the annotations are
completed, we plan to separate the suffixes with a
morphological parser to provide a full view of the
morphology of the arguments.
Another issue was how to annotate shared sub-
jects in subordinate clauses. Turkish allows sub-
ject pro-drop and in complex sentences, the shared
subject is shown by the person agreement suffix
on the verb of the consequent clause. To capture
this fact, we chose to exclude shared subjects from
the annotation of the arguments. This style of
annotation conforms to the minimality principle.
As illustrated in (3), the subject, Neriman, which
appears in its canonical clause-initial position in
ARG2 is not selected because the verb of the sub-
sequent clause carries the person agreement suffix.

Although Neriman does not want-FACTN-AGR
people to smoke in her bedroom, (she) doesn’t
say-AGR anything for the moment.2
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.87712475">
If the subject is not shared, it is included in the
annotation, even if it causes discontinuity. As it
is illustrated in (4), ARG2 intervenes in ARG1 by
separating it from its subject.

2The pronoun is in parentheses to reflect pro-drop. The
following abbreviations are used on the translations to show
the morphological characteristics of the clauses: ACTN: Ac-

ment suffix, DAT: Dative case, ABL: Ablative case. NOM:
Nominative case.

<bodyText confidence="0.934577454545455">
Example (5) shows that two nominalized
clauses can be selected as the arguments of the
subordinator kars¸ın leaving out the shared sub-
ject. In this example, the subject is shown between
square brackets for clarity. Note that, ARG1 is
also a nominalized clause since it is embedded un-
der the attribution verb s¨oyle - ‘say’.3

stating that everyone gets a share proportional to

Finally, in annotating adjuncts, we follow the
same principle we followed in annotating shared
subjects. For instance in (6), the adjunct yemekte
’at dinner’ is not annotated since it is shared by the
arguments of the connective ra˘gmen.

4 The Annotation Process
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999505">
Before the annotation procedure started, a set of
annotation guidelines were prepared. The guide-
lines include the basic principles, such as what
discourse connectives are, where in the discourse
one can find ARG1 and ARG2, how to annotate
shared subjects, adjuncts, etc. Rather than being
strict rules, the guidelines are aimed at being gen-
eral principles guiding the annotators in their de-
cision of selecting the text span that is minimally
sufficient for interpreting the discourse relation en-
coded by the connective.
The annotation cycle consisted of 1) annotat-
ing a connective by at least three different people
2) measuring the agreement among them with the
inter-anotator agreement tool 3) resolving the dis-
agreements with an anonymous decision.

the annotator can use his/her knowledge of Turk-
ish word structure to collect similarly inflected
words without morphological analysis. For exam-
ple, -ArAk$, in which the uppercase forms repre-
sent metaphonemes, will bring words ending with

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983612903226">
The TDB project is a first attempt in creating an
annotated resource for written Turkish discourse.
The annotation process is still continuing. In this
paper, the emphasis was on a small number of con-
nectives, namely three postpositions, which form a
subclass of subordinators. The paper described the
role of certain morpho-syntactic facts in interpret-
ing the coherence relation between two clauses,
and how these facts were reflected in the annota-
tions.
Three subjects separately annotated each of the
subordinators on the annotation tool, and inter-
rater reliability was calculated. The statistics were
obtained from Cochran’s Q test to the ARG1 and
ARG2 spans. The annotation data were encoded
with 1 if the character is in the span and 0 if it
is not. The encoded data were put to the Q test.
All the results were above the minimum success
probability (&gt;0.05), showing that the annotations
were consistent (see Table 2). We will run another
Cochran experiment in which we will test whether
the annotators agree on ARG1/ARG2 boundaries,
rather than just word inclusion in the text spans as
above.
Given the distribution of agreements, Cochran
provides the number of subjects who must agree
so that a text span can be reliably considered an
ARG1 or ARG2. This we believe is important to
report with the final product (to be made public
soon), so that its gold standard can be assessed by
the community.

On the other hand, the connective halde expects a factive nominal and the person agreement suffix. In the examples below, we show these suffixes with glosses on the English translations. The arguments of subordinators are necessarily adjacent and mostly exhibit the ARG2-ARG1 order because Turkish is a left-branching language and subordinate clauses are on the left in canonical order.

We introduce the project and describe some of the issues that were important in annotating three subordinators, namely kars¸ın, ra˘gmen and halde, all of which encode the coherence relation Contrast-Concession. We also describe the annotation tool. 1 Introduction The Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is a project initiated by the joint effort of a group of researchers in Turkey. The project builds on an existing corpus, namely the METU Turkish Corpus (MTC) (Say et al., 2002), and extends it to a discourse level resource by following the principles of the PDTB (Prasad et al., 2007) in annotating discourse connectives and their arguments. The 2- million-word MTC contains 520 continuous texts from various genres written between 1991-2000. From a semantic perspective, we take discourse connectives as predicates that take as their arguments tensed or untensed clauses with abstract object interpretations. Abstract objects are propositions, facts, events, situations, etc. (Asher, 1993). Connectives themselves may be realized explicitly or implicitly (Halliday, 1985; Prasad et al., 2007). Explicit connectives are simple or complex lexical items that encode a discourse relation</context>

However, in Turkish, they are so common as arguments of subordinators that we would have missed an important property of Turkish discourse if we did not annotate them. In the rest of the paper, we provide examples taken from the MTC. We underline the connective, show ARG2 in bold letters and render ARG1 in italics. 3.1 The minimality principle As in the PDTB, the minimality principle is invoked, according to which clauses, parts of clauses or sentences that are minimally necessary and sufficient for the discourse relation engendered by the connective are annotated as ARG1 or ARG2 (Prasad et al., 2007). Any other text span that is perceived to be important for the interpretation of the discourse relation can be selected as supplementary information in addition to ARG1 or ARG2. 3.2 Morphological properties of the arguments and their relative ordering In Turkish, subordinate clauses are essentially nominalizations, which may be formed by -DIK or -mA suffixes (the factive nominal and the action nominal, respectively (Kornfilt, 1997)).

(Note that the ARG2 designation does not imply that ARG2 is consequent or antecedent.) In certain cases presupposition needs a mediator, viz. the discourse connective. Nonconnectival discourse relations are certainly possible, but connective-engendered discourse relations are claimed to be more specific about their semantics, e.g. they bring about presuppositional meaning (van der Sandt, 1992; Webber et al., 1999). In this regard, the ARG1/ARG2 classification is unlike syntactic subcategorization, which is a lexical property of functors (e.g. verbs) which are not necessarily presuppositional and hence they can differ in arbitrary ways (ditransitive, transitive, unergative, unaccusative etc.). 2 The Data The MTC is preprocessed to obtain the raw texts keeping the title, author, publishing date and the text type information at the beginning of each file. Stand-off annotation is done on the textual rendering of the MTC. To enable the data to be viewable universally without losing any character information</context>

Abstract objects are propositions, facts, events, situations, etc. (Asher, 1993). Connectives themselves may be realized explicitly or implicitly (Halliday, 1985; Prasad et al., 2007). Explicit connectives are simple or complex lexical items that encode a discourse relation, while implicit connectives can be inferred from related text spans that have coherence relations. The TDB project aims to annotate explicit connectives only. In Turkish, discourse connectives are identified with three syntactic categories (Zeyrek and Webber, 2008): (a) Coordinating conjunctions (b) Subordinators (c) Discourse adverbials (or anaphoric 0Corresponding author: dezeyrek@metu.edu.tr connectives). All these discourse connectives have two and only two arguments, which are conveniently labeled as ARG1 and ARG2.1 ARG2 is always the argument that syntactically hosts the connective. The ARG1/ARG2 organization of discourse connectives is consistent with the following observations in discourse: Sentences in discourse are coherently related, and therefore when explicit discourse connectives are used, if they are really discourse connectives, they are</context>
