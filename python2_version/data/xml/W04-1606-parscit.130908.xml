This paper discusses several issues in Arabic
orthography that were encountered in the
process of performing morphology analysis
and POS tagging of 542,543 Arabic words in
three newswire corpora at the LDC during
2002-2004, by means of the Buckwalter
Arabic Morphological Analyzer. The most
important issues involved variation in the
orthography of Modern Standard Arabic that
called for specific changes to the Analyzer
algorithm, and also a more rigorous definition
of typographic errors. Some orthographic
anomalies had a direct impact on word
tokenization, which in turn affected the
morphology analysis and assignment of POS
tags.

<bodyText confidence="0.998859375">
In 2002 the LDC began using output from the
Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer
(Buckwalter, 2002), in order to perform
morphological annotation and POS tagging of
Arabic newswire text. From 2002 to 2004 three
corpora were analyzed and over half a million
Arabic word tokens were annotated and tagged
(see Table 1).1

The author was responsible for developing and
maintaining the Analyzer, which primarily
involved filling in the gaps in the lexicon and
modifying the POS tag set in order to meet the
requirements of treebanking efforts that were
performed subsequently at the LDC with the same
annotated and POS-tagged newswire data.
2 Lessons from the AFP corpus
During the tagging of the AFP data, the first
corpus in the series, the Buckwalter Analyzer was
equipped to handle basic orthographic variation
that often goes unnoticed because it is a common
feature of written Arabic (Buckwalter, 1992). This
orthographic variation involves the writing (or
omission) of hamza above or below alif in stem-
initial position, and to a lesser extent, the writing
(or omission) of madda on alif, also in stem-initial
position. In both cases use of the bare alif without
hamza or madda is quite common and goes by
unnoticed by most readers. What took the LDC
morphology annotation team by surprise was to
find that in the AFP data the common omission of
hamza in this environment had been extended to
stem-medial and stem-final positions as well, as
seen in the following words from that corpus: تاﺪﺑ
نﺎﺸﺑ ﺪﻴآﺎﺘﻟ تار ﻒﻧﺎﺘﺴﺗ ﺲﻴﺳﺎﺗ ﺮﺧﺎﺘﻣ ﺪﻴﻳﺎﺗ .
This type of orthographic variation was not
attested to the same extent in the two subsequent
corpora, Ummah and Annahar, which leads us to
conclude that some orthographic practices might
be restricted to specific news agencies. It is
important to note that most of the native Arabic
speakers who annotated the AFP data using the
output from the Analyzer did not regard these
omissions of hamza on alif in stem-medial and
stem-final positions as orthographic errors, and
fully expected the Analyzer to provide a solution.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99927825">
During the tagging of the Ummah data, a
different set of orthographic issues arose. Although
the Buckwalter Analyzer was equipped to handle
so-called “Egyptian” spelling (where word-final
ya’ is spelled without the two dots, making it
identical to alif maqsura), the Ummah corpus
presented the LDC annotation team with just the
opposite phenomenon: dozens of word-final alif
maqsura’s spelled with two dots.2 Whereas some
of the affected words were automatically rejected
as typographical errors (e.g., ﻲﺘﻣ ﻲﺳﻮﻣ ﻲﻠﻋﻷا يﺮﻘﻟا
يﺮﺧأ), others where gladly analyzed at face value
(e.g., ﻲﻠﻋ ﻲﻟإ يﺪﻟ). Unfortunately, this led to
numerous false positive analyses: for example ﻲﻠﻋ
was analyzed as ‘ali and ‘alayya, but not as ‘ala.
Initially, these words were tagged as typographical
errors, but their pervasiveness led the LDC team to
reconsider this position, upon which the author was
asked to modify the Analyzer algorithm in order to
accommodate this typographic anomaly. As a
result, all words ending in ya’ were now re-
interpreted as ending in either ya’ or alif maqsura,
and both forms were analyzed, as seen in the
following (abridged) output:3

The Annahar corpus presented no orthographic
surprises, or at least nothing that the LDC
annotation team had not seen before. The Annahar
data did contain some additional orthographic
2 It is not entirely clear whether these “dotted” alif
maqsura’s were produced by human typists or by an
encoding conversion process gone awry. It is possible
that the original keyboarding was done on a platform
where word-final ya’ and alif maqsura are displayed via
visually identical “un-dotted” glyphs, so it makes no
difference which of the two keys the typist presses on
the keyboard: both produce the same visual display, but
are stored electronically as two different characters.

features that we now identify as being common to
all three corpora, as well as corpora outside the set
we have annotated at the LDC.
The first orthographic feature relates to the
somewhat free interchange of stem-initial hamza
above alif and hamza below alif. With some lexical
items the orthographic variation simply reflects
variation in pronunciation: for example, both
‘isbaniya (with hamza under alif) and ‘asbaniya
(with hamza above alif) are well attested. But in
cases involving other orthographic pairs, more
interpretations are possible. Take, for instance,
what we called the “qala ‘anna” problem. This
problem was identified after numerous encounters
with constructions in which qala was followed by
‘anna rather than ‘inna, and for no apparent
linguistic reason. Initially this was treated as a
typographical error, but again, its pervasiveness
forced us to take a different approach.
One solution we considered was to modify the
Analyzer algorithm so that instances of stem-initial
hamza on alif would also be treated as possible
instances of hamza under alif, very much in the
spirit of the approach we used for dealing with the
alif maqsura / ya’ free variation cited earlier.
However, there is compelling evidence that the
orthography of hamza in stem-initial position is a
fairly reliable indication of the perceived value of
subsequent short vowel: a or u for hamza above
alif, and i for hamza below alif. In other words,
there is no free variation. The decision was taken
to regard “qala ‘anna” constructions as gram-
matically acceptable in MSA.4

5 Concatenation in Arabic orthography
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980875">
The second, and more serious, orthographic
anomaly we encountered in all three corpora is
what we call the problem of Arabic “run-on”
words, or free concatenation of words when the
word immediately preceding ends with a non-
connector letter, such as alif, dal, dhal, ra, za,
waw, ta marbuta, etc.
The most frequent “run-on” words in Arabic are
combinations of the high-frequency function words
la and ma (which end in alif) with following
perfect or imperfect verbs, such as la-yazal, ma-
yuram, and ma-zala (لاﺰﻳﻻ ماﺮﻳﺎﻣ لازﺎﻣ). The la of
“absolute negation” concatenates freely with
nouns, as in la-budda, la-shakka ( ﺪﺑﻻ ﻚ ﺷﻻ). It can
be argued that these are lexicalized collocations,
but their spelling with intervening space (لاﺰﻳ ﻻ –
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.4824886">
4 Badawi, Carter and Gully regard “qala ‘anna”
constructions as grammatical but restricted to contexts
“where the exact words of the speaker are not used or
reported” (Badawi, Carter and Gully 2004, p. 713). This
assertion could be investigated in the LDC corpora.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.998319295454546">
لاز ﺎﻣ – ﺪﺑ ﻻ) is just as frequent as their spelling in
concatenated form.
Proper name phrases, especially those involving
the word ‘abd (ﷲاﺪﺒﻋ ﻦﻤﺣﺮﻟاﺪﺒﻋ ) are also written
either separately or in concatenated form. Part of
the data annotation process at the LDC involves
assigning case endings to tokenized words, but
there is currently no mechanism in the Analyzer to
assign two case endings (or several pairs of POS
tags) to what is being processed as a single word
token. As a result of this, the phrase ‘abd allah is
assigned a single POS tag and case ending when it
is written in concatenated form, but two POS tags
and two case endings when written with
intervening space.
The problem of assigning more than one case
ending and POS tag to concatenations is more
obvious in fully lexicalized concatenations such as
khamsumi’atin, sittumi’atin, sab’umi’atin, etc
(ﺔﺋﺎﻤﺴﻤﺧ – ﺔﺋﺎﻤﺘﺳ – ﺔﺋﺎﻤﻌﺒﺳ). When these numbers are
written with intervening space (ﺔﺋﺎﻣ ﺲﻤﺧ – ﺔﺋﺎﻣ ﺖﺳ –
ﺔﺋﺎﻣ ﻊﺒﺳ), two case endings and two POS tags are
assigned by the Analyzer. But when they are
written in concatenated form only one case ending
and POS tag is assigned, and the “infixed” case
ending of the first token is left undefined:
khamsmi’atin, sittmi’atin, sab’mi’atin, etc. 5
So far we have discussed relatively controlled
concatenation, involving mostly high-frequency
function words and lexicalized phrases. But
concatenation extends beyond that to random
combinations of words—the only requirement
being that the word immediately preceding end
with a non-connector letter. These concatenations
are fairly frequent, as attested by their Google
scores (see Table 2).
It is important to note that these concatenations
are not immediately obvious to readers due to the
characteristics of proportionally spaced Arabic
fonts. Most of the native readers of Arabic at the
LDC did not consider concatenations such as these
to be typographical errors. Their logic was best
expressed in the statement: “I can read the text just
fine. Why can’t the Morphological Analyzer?”
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9596136">
5 We regard these as “fully lexicalized”
concatenations because the first of the two constituent
tokens ends in a connector letter. In other word, their
concatenation is deliberate and not an accident of
orthography.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999776096774194">
There are several levels of orthographic variation
in Arabic, and each level calls for a specific
response to resolve the orthographic anomaly. It is
important that the output analysis record which
method was used to resolve the anomaly. The
methods used for resolving orthographic anomaly
range from exact matching of the surface
orthography to various strategies of orthography
manipulation. Each manipulation strategy carries
with it certain assumptions about the text, and
these assumptions should be part of the output
analysis. For example, an analysis of ﻲﻠﻋ obtained
by exact matching in a text known to contain
suspicious word-final ya’s (that may be alif
maqsura’s) does not have the same value as an
analysis of the same word, using the same exact
matching, but in a text where word-final ya’s and
alif maqsura’s display normal character
distribution frequencies.
The problem of run-on words in Arabic calls for
a reassessment of current tokenization strategies,
including the definition of “word token” itself. 6 It
should be assumed that each input string represents
one or more potential word tokens, each of which
needs to be submitted individually for morphology
analysis. For example, the input string ﻢﺗﺪﻘﻓ can be
segmented as a single word token, yielding two
morphological analyses (faqad-tum and fa-qud-
tum) or it can be segmented as two word tokens
(fqd tm), yielding several possible analysis pairs
(faqada / fuqida / faqd / fa-qad + tamma).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.970693">
6 By “tokenization” we mean the identification of
orthographically valid character string units that can be
submitted to the Analyzer for analysis. The Analyzer
itself performs a different kind of “tokenization” by
identifying prefixes and suffixes that are bound
morphemes but which may be treated as “word tokens”
in syntactic analysis.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999577">
Syntactic analysis would be needed for
determining which morphology analysis is most
likely the correct one for each tokenization (fqdtm
and fqd tm).
