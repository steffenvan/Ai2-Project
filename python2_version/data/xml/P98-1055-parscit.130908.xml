Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999908441176471">
This paper presents a practical foreign
language writing support tool which makes it
much easier to utilize dictionary and example
sentence resources. Like a Kana-Kanji
conversion front-end processor used to input
Japanese language text, this tool is also
implemented as a front-end processor and
can be combined with a wide variety of
applications. A morphological analyzer
automatically extracts key words from text as
it is being input into the tool, and these words
are used to locate information relevant to the
input text. This information is then
automatically displayed to the user. With this
tool, users can concentrate better on their
writing because much less interruption of
their work is required for the consulting of
dictionaries or for the retrieval of reference
sentences. Retrieval and display may be
conducted in any of three ways: 1) relevant
information is retrieved and displayed
automatically; 2) information is retrieved
automatically but displayed only on user
command; 3) information is both retrieved
and displayed only on user command. The
extent to which the retrieval and display of
information proceeds automatically depends
on the type of information being referenced;
this element of the design adds to system
efficiency. Further, by combining this tool
with a stepped-level interactive machine
translation function, we have created a PC
support tool to help Japanese people write in
English.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951305555556">
When creating text using word processing
software on a personal computer, it is common to
refer to books or documents relevant to the text,
including various kinds of dictionaries and
reference works. The tools used for accessing
relevant information, such as CD-ROM
dictionaries, text databases, and text retrieval
software, however, often require user actions
that may seriously interrupt the writing process
itself. These may include executing retrieval
software, inputting key words, or copying
retrieved information into texts.
The foreign language writing support tool we
propose here automatically access information
relevant to input texts. Like a Kana-Kanji
conversion front-end processor used to input
Japanese language text, this tool is also
implemented as a front-end processor (FEP) and
can be combined with a wide variety of
applications. The extent to which the retrieval
and display of information proceeds
automatically depends on the type of information
being referenced; this element of the design adds
to system efficiency.
In Section 2, we consider the requirements for
efficient writing support tools and discuss the
characteristics of our front-end processor and its
automatic information access function. In Section
3, we introduce our English writing support tool,
which has been developed to help Japanese
people write in English on a PC. This, tool
combines a front-end processor with the stepped-
level interactive machine translation method we
first proposed in Yamabana (1997). In Section 4,
we describe the automatic information access
function of the English writing support tool.

<bodyText confidence="0.998491666666667">
To allow users to concentrate better on their work,
writing support tools with reference information
access functions should:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991191428571429">
1) provide for automatic access of reference
information, i.e. access without explicit
user commands,
2) enable users to utilize retrieved information
with simple operations, and
3) be compatible with a wide variety of word
processing applications.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9920336875">
In developing our FEP-type support tool, we
started with the text retrieval application
proposed in Muralci (1997), which provides a
morphological analyzer that automatically
analyzes users&apos; input and extracts key words to
retrieve relevant text from a database. This
application fulfills the first of the requirement
listed above. We converted such a morphological
analyzer into an FEP for use in our tool, which is
placed between the keyboard and an application.
When a user inputs texts into this tool, the
morphological analyzer identifies each word and
extracts key words automatically before the text
is entered into the application. The key words are
used to retrieve information relevant to the input
texts. This information is displayed for easy
editing and utilization. Because all of this can be
achieved with standard hooks and the IME API
of the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system,
this tool can be combined with any Windows-
compatible text-input application. In addition, it
can be combined with any other front-end
processor, including Kana-Kanji conversion
FEPs, through the use of a technique we have
recently developed. Figure 1 shows the tool
architecture.
2.2. Controlling the extent of the
automation of information retrieval

introduced in the previous subsection allows
users to concentrate better on their writing

because much less interruption of their work is
required for the consulting of dictionaries or for
the retrieval of reference sentences. This function,
however, might prevent users from concentrating
on their writing if all the retrieved information
were displayed in a new window, especially
when the quantity of the retrieved information
were large and the majority of it were not
relevant from the users&apos; point of view.
To compensate for this disadvantage, we
divided the information access function into three
steps: 1) extracting key words from the input text,
2) using the key words to retrieve reference
information, and 3) displaying the retrieved
information, and we developed a function to
control whether the each step is executed
automatically or manually. We prepare three
methods for retrieval and display as follows.
A) Relevant information is retrieved and
displayed automatically, without user
command.
B) Information is retrieved automatically but
displayed only on user command. After
automatic retrieval, only the quantity of
information is displayed, and users can
decide whether to display it.

<bodyText confidence="0.988382125">
By combining the FEP-type information access
platform with the stepped-level interactive
machine translation method we proposed in
Yamabana (1997), we have developed an English
writing support tool to help Japanese people write
in English on a PC. This tool, named &amp;quot;Eibun
Meibun Meikingu&amp;quot;, consists of the following
three components:

<listItem confidence="0.9862455">
1) an English writing FEP, &amp;quot;Eisaku Pen&amp;quot;2,
which converts Japanese into English,
2) a CD-ROM dictionary consulting tool,

3) a Japanese-to-English bilingual example
sentence database, &amp;quot;Reibun Bainda&amp;quot;4.

window to display all the possible equivalents
for &amp;quot;arigato&amp;quot;, by selecting from which, users can
easily change equivalents. In this alternatives
window, &amp;quot;Eisaku Pen&amp;quot; provides part-of-speech of
each alternative equivalents and supplementary
information indicating the difference between
their meanings or usage in order to make users&apos;
equivalent selection easier.
After confirming the equivalents of input
words, users can execute the Japanese-to-English
conversion function, which transforms
Japanese grammatical constructions into those of
English and the whole sentence is converted to
an English sentence: &apos;Thank you for a present.&apos;
by automatic word reordering and article
insertion. This syntactic transformation
proceeds step by step, in a bottom-up manner,
combining smaller translation components into
larger ones. Such a &apos;dictionary-based
interactive translation&apos; approach allows users to
refine dictionary suggestions at different steps of
the process. Finally, users can also easily change
articles to obtain the result sentence: &apos;Thank
you for the present.&apos;
The system dictionary of &amp;quot;Eisaku Pen&amp;quot;
contains about 100,000 Japanese vocabulary
entries and 15,000 idiomatic expressions. Since
there was no source available to build an idiom
dictionary of this size, we collected them
manually, from scratch, following a method
described in Tamura (1997).

While using &amp;quot;Eisaku Pen&amp;quot;, if users want to obtain

&amp;quot;Shoseki Renzu&amp;quot; provides a function to consult
CD-ROM dictionaries.
For example, when users execute the CD-

currently selected alternative &apos;thank you&apos; is
regarded as a key word for dictionary consulting

&amp;quot;Eibun Meibun Meikingu&amp;quot; also provides a
function to retrieve and utilize bilingual example
sentences. Example sentences relevant to the
texts input by users are retrieved from the
database of &amp;quot;Reibun Bainda&amp;quot; containing 3,000 of
Japanese-to-English bilingual sentence pairs for
letter writing. Figure 4 illustrates the Japanese-to-

Japanese word &amp;quot;arigato&amp;quot; is regarded as a key
word for retrieving and the example sentences
which are assigned a key word &amp;quot;arigato&amp;quot;

4. Information Access Function of
English Writing Support Tool
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971081632653">
Our tool currently accesses three types of
information: 1) information, included in the
system dictionary, regarding grammatical forms
and idiomatic expressions; 2) straight CD-ROM
dictionary information; and 3) Japanese-to-
English example sentences in the database. The
extent to which the retrieval and display of
information proceeds automatically depends on
the type of information being referenced;
information of type 1) is retrieved and displayed
automatically, that of type 2) is both retrieved
and displayed manually, and that of type 3) is
retrieved automatically but displayed manually.
In the first case of translation equivalents and
grammatical information retrieval, &amp;quot;Eisaku Pen&amp;quot;
automatically retrieves and displays English
words equivalent to the input Japanese texts
without explicit user command because users
always utilize the English equivalents in English
writing.
In the second case of CD-ROM dictionary
consulting, &amp;quot;Shoseki Renzu&amp;quot; retrieves and
displays contents of CD-ROM dictionaries on
user command because this dictionary consulting
function needs to be executed only when users
require additional information. Our tool requires
much less user action than other dictionary
consulting tools because key words are
automatically extracted before user command for
retrieval and users don&apos;t always need to input key
words.
In the third case of bilingual sentence retrieval,
&amp;quot;Reibun Bainda&amp;quot; retrieves sentences
automatically but displays only on user command.
Because &amp;quot;Reibun Bainda&amp;quot; contains the example
sentences in itself, relevant sentences are
retrieved at high speed and the retrieval function
doesn&apos;t interrupt users&apos; writing process.
Retrieved sentences, however, might include the
ones not relevant to the input text from users&apos;
point of view, because similarity between
sentences is judged with a simple method using
key words. Therefore, the writing process might
be interrupted if retrieved sentences were
displayed automatically. To avoid this problem,
the color of the icon of &amp;quot;Reibun Bainda&amp;quot; is
changed after automatic retrieval, depending on
the existence of relevant sentences, and users can
decide whether to display the retrieved sentences.

The extent to which the retrieval and display of information proceeds automatically depends on the type of information being referenced; this element of the design adds to system efficiency. 3. English Writing Support Tool &amp;quot;Eibun Meibun Meikingu&amp;quot; By combining the FEP-type information access platform with the stepped-level interactive machine translation method we proposed in Yamabana (1997), we have developed an English writing support tool to help Japanese people write in English on a PC. This tool, named &amp;quot;Eibun Meibun Meikingu&amp;quot;, consists of the following three components: 1) an English writing FEP, &amp;quot;Eisaku Pen&amp;quot;2, which converts Japanese into English, 2) a CD-ROM dictionary consulting tool, &amp;quot;Shoseki Renzu&amp;quot;3, and 3) a Japanese-to-English bilingual example sentence database, &amp;quot;Reibun Bainda&amp;quot;4. Figure 2 shows the architecture of &amp;quot;Eibun Meibun Meikingu&amp;quot;. This tool is now available as a software package. 3.1.
