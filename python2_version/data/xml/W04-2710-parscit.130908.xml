High-quality lexical resources are needed to
both train and evaluate Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD) systems. The problem of am-
biguity persists even in limited domains, thus
the necessity for wide-coverage inventories of
senses (dictionaries) and corpora sense-tagged

for WSD, for both its broad coverage and its
large network of semantic relations. In this

High-quality lexical resources are needed to both train
and evaluate Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) sys-
tems. The problem of ambiguity persists even in lim-
ited domains, thus the necessity for wide-coverage inven-
tories of senses (dictionaries) and corpora sense-tagged

1998) has been used extensively for WSD, both for its
broad coverage and its large network of semantic rela-
tions. Entries in WordNet have, until now, been organized
primarily around the semantic relations of synonymy,
antonymy, hyponymy/troponymy, meronymy, and a few
others which hold mainly among lexicalized concepts and
word forms of the same grammatical class.1 The noun
and verb networks have been predominantly hierarchi-

cal, and the definitional glosses and illustrative sentences
have not participated in the network of relations at all.
This paper reports on a project currently underway to
sense-tag the glosses. Sense-tagging is the process of
linking an instance of a word to the WordNet synset rep-
resenting its context-appropriate meaning. Monosemous
words2 in the glosses can be tagged automatically, but
in order to be truly reliable, the sense-tagging of polyse-
mous words3 must be done manually. This approach is in
significant contrast with the work done at The University
of Texas at Dallas on Extended WordNet4, in which poly-
semous words in the WordNet glosses were sense-tagged
primarily by automatic means. The result of the project
described here will be to increase connectivity and make
possible the association of words with related concepts
that cut across grammatical class and hierarchy, provid-
ing a more integrated lexical resource.

Previous efforts to sense-tag corpora manually have
demonstrated that the task is not trivial. To begin with,
the possibility of distinguishing word senses definitively
in general is recognized as being problematic (Atkins and
Levin, 1988; Kilgarriff, 1997; Hanks, 2000); indeed the
notion of a “sense” has itself been the subject of long de-
bate (see the Hanks and Kilgarriff papers for two recent
contributions). These are topics in need of serious con-
sideration, but outside of the scope of this paper. Certain
issues emerge that are particularly relevant to designing

3A word is polysemous if it has more than one related
sense. A word with more than one unrelated sense is called
a homonym. “Bank” is the classic example, its unrelated senses
being “river bank” and “financial institution.” WordNet does not
make a distinction between homonymy and polysemy, therefore
a monosemous word in WordNet is one which has neither re-
lated nor unrelated senses.

a manual sense-tagging system, and it is these we will
concentrate on here.
The difficulties inherent in the sense-tagging task in-
clude the order in which words are presented to tag, a
word’s degree of polysemy and part of speech, vagueness
of the context, the order in which senses are presented,
granularity of the senses, and level of expertise of the per-
son doing the tagging. Each will be addressed briefly in
the following sections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989567">
2.1 Targeted vs. sequential or ‘lexical’ vs. ‘textual’
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995636363636">
There are two approaches one can take to the order in
which words are tagged. In the sequential approach,
termed ‘textual’ by Kilgarriff (1998), the tagger proceeds
through the text one word at a time, assigning the context-
appropriate sense to each open class word as it is en-
countered. The targeted approach (‘lexical’ in Kilgar-
riff’s terms) involves tagging all corpus instances of a
pre-selected word, jumping through the text to each oc-
currence. The corpora produced by the SEMCOR and
READER projects were tagged sequentially; the Kilo and
HECTOR projects used the targeted approach (Kilo and
READER are described in Miller et al. (1998), HECTOR
in Atkins (1993), and SEMCOR in Fellbaum, ed. (1998)).
In sequential tagging, the tagger is following the narra-
tive, and so has the meaning of the text in mind when
selecting senses for each new word encountered (con-
text is foremost). In targeted tagging, the tagger has the
various meanings of the word in mind when presented
with each new context (sense distinctions are foremost).
In their comparisons of the two approaches, Fellbaum et
al. (2003) and Kilgarriff (1998) both conclude that se-
quential tagging increases the difficulty of the task by re-
quiring the tagger to acquaint (and then reacquaint) them-
selves with the senses of a word each time they are con-
fronted with it in the text. The targeted approach, on
the other hand, enables the tagger to gain mastery of the
sense-distinctions of a single word at a time, reducing the
amount of effort required to tag each new instance. Miller
et al. (1998) present a contrasting view. In evaluating the
Kilo and READER tagging tasks, they find targeted tag-
ging to be more tedious for the taggers than sequential
tagging, and no faster, as time is needed to assimilate new
contexts for each word occurrence.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998984">
2.2 Polysemy, POS, and sense order
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914964285714">
In their 1997 paper, Fellbaum et al. analyzed the results
of the SEMCOR project, in which part of the Brown Cor-
pus (Kuˇcera and Francis, 1967) was tagged to WordNet
1.4 senses. Their analysis identified three factors that
influenced the difficulty level, and thus the accuracy, of
the tagging task: degree of polysemy of the word being
tagged, the word’s part of speech, and the order in which
the WordNet sense choices are displayed to the person
doing the tagging.
The effect of a high degree of polysemy is to present
more choices to the tagger, usually with finer distinctions
among the senses, increasing the difficulty of selecting
one out of several closely-related senses.
The correspondence of a word’s part of speech with
accuracy of tagging stems from the nature of the objects
that words of a certain class denote. Words that refer to
concepts that are concrete tend to have relatively fixed,
easily distinguishable senses. Words with more abstract
or generic referents tend to have a more flexible seman-
tics, with meanings being assigned in context, and hence
more difficult to pin down. Nouns tend to be in the for-
mer category, verbs in the latter. More abstract classes
also tend to have a higher degree of polysemy, adding to
the effect.
Finally, the presentation of the sense choices in Word-
Net order, with the most frequent sense first, creates a
bias towards selecting the first sense. Their study shows
that randomly ordering the senses removes this effect.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999958">
2.3 Granularity of senses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9826928125">
Palmer et al. (to appear, 2004) examines the relationship
between manual and automatic tagging accuracy and the
granularity of the sense inventory. Granularity has to do
with fineness of distinctions made from a lexicographer’s
point of view, and not the number of senses that a word
form exhibits in context. It is related to polysemy, in
that the greater a word’s degree of polysemy, the finer the
distinctions that can be made in defining senses for that
word. In their experiment, Palmer et al. have lexicogra-
phers group WordNet 1.75 senses according to syntactic
and semantic criteria, which are used by taggers to tag
corpus instances. An automatic WSD system trained on
the data tagged using grouped senses shows a 10% overall
improvement in performance against running it on data
tagged without using the groupings. Their study shows
that improvement came not from the fewer number of
senses resulting from the groupings, but from the group-
ings themselves, which increased the manual tags’ accu-
racy (defined as agreement between taggers), thereby in-
creasing the accuracy of the systems that learned from
them. This effect arises from the slippery nature of word
senses and the impossibility of capturing them in neatly
delimited, universally agreed-upon sense-boxes. New us-
ages of words extending old meanings, vague contexts
that select for multiple senses, and the limits of the tag-
ger’s own knowledge of a specialized domain, all defy
the assignment of a single, unequivocal sense to a word’s
instance across annotators. Palmer et al. propose sense
groupings as a practical solution in these situations.
&apos;The words used for this experiment were the polysemous
verbs from the lexical sample task for SENSEVAL-2 (Edmonds
and Cotton, 2001).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991055">
2.4 Tagger expertise
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987285714286">
Finally, there is the question of whether novice tag-
gers with adequate training can attain the level of accu-
racy of experienced lexicographers and linguists. Fell-
baum et al. (1997) answer this in the negative. Their
findings show novice tagger accuracy decreasing as the
number of senses, or fineness of distinctions among the
senses, increases. Level of expertise likely influenced the
slow pace of tagging reported for the Kilo and READER
projects, which employed novice taggers. During the
tagging of the evaluation dataset for SENSEVAL-1, the
highly experienced lexicographers who did the tagging
reported the time spent absorbing new contexts dropped
off rapidly after a slow start-up period (Krishnamurthy
and Nicholls, 2000).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.966571">
2.5 The present approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967794117647">
To the extent that these difficulties can be addressed, we
have attempted to do so. We feel the most accurate re-
sults can be obtained from the targeted approach using
linguistically-trained taggers. The nature of the glosses
(relatively short, completely self-contained) means that
a fairly restricted context will need to be assimilated for
each instance of a token, eliminating one factor of diffi-
culty associated with the targeted approach. Since a def-
inition is, by definition, unambiguous, the context pro-
vided by a gloss should, in theory, never be insufficient to
disambiguate the words used within it. In this respect, the
glosses differ from KWIC (Key Word In Context) lines in
a concordance, with which they can be compared. KWIC
concordances, so named because they display corpus in-
stances of a (key) word along with surrounding text, are
used by lexicographers in a manner very similar to the
targeted approach to sense-tagging. There the task is to
define the word, to determine and delineate its senses
given its contexts of use. One further difference to be
exploited is the fact that, unlike a sentence in a typical
corpus, a gloss is embedded within a network of WordNet
relations. This means that immediate hypernym, domain
category, and other relations can be made available to the
user as additional disambiguation aids.
The order of the senses will be scrambled in the man-
ual tagging interface so as to prevent a bias towards the
first sense listed. To avoid putting any additional burden
on the tagger, the order of senses will be fixed at the be-
ginning of the session, and kept constant until the tagger
exits the program or selects another word to tag.
Underspecified word senses are expressed in WordNet
in the form of verb groups6, which will be presented to
the tagger in the sense display with the option to select
either the entire group, or individual senses within the

group. Where no appropriate grouping exists, and con-
text and domain category are not enough to fully disam-
biguate, multiple tags can be assigned. Precise guidelines
for when multiple senses can be assigned, and under what
criteria, will need to be developed, and taggers will need
to be extensively trained on them.

3 Annotating the glosses
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999342564102564">
There are six major components to the present sense-
tagging system. They function in pipeline fashion, with
the output of one being fed as input to the next. Each
pass through the data produces output in valid XML, the
structure of which is covered in Subsection 3.1. The six
components are: (1) a gloss parser, (2) a tokenizer, (3) an
ignorable text chunker and classifier, (4) a WordNet col-
location7 recognizer, (5) an automatic sense tagger, and
(6) a manual tagging tool.
Prior to and in conjunction with building the prepro-
cessor (the first four components), analysis of the Word-
Net glosses was undertaken to determine what should be
presented for tagging, and what was not to be tagged.
Ignorable classes of word forms and multi-word forms
were determined during this phase. These were used as
a basis for the development of a stop list of words and
phrases to ignore completely, and a second, semi-stop list
that we have dubbed the “wait list”. The stop list is re-
served for unequivocally closed-class words and phrases
including prepositions, conjunctions, determiners, pro-
nouns and modals, plus multi-word forms that function
as prepositions (e.g., “by means of”). Words on the wait
list will be held out from the automatic tagging stage for
manual review and tagging later. Since WordNet covers
only open-class parts of speech, word forms that have ho-
mographs in both open and closed-class parts of speech
are on this list. During the manual tagging stage, the
open-class senses will be tagged. Highly polysemous
words such as “be” and “have” are also waitlisted.
Many glosses also contain example sentences. While
not an essential part of the semantic makeup of the
synset, they do give some information about the illus-
trated word’s sense-specific context of use, contributing
to meaning in a different way.8 For this reason, we will
be tagging the synset word (and only that word) of which
the sentence is an exemplar. By virtue of being located
within the synset, the exemplified form is in effect auto-
matically disambiguated—it’s just a matter of assigning
the tag.

3.1 The glosstag DTD
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955982017857143">
Development of the formal model for the sense-tagged
glosses took the DTD from the SEMCOR project as a
starting point (Landes et al., 1998). It went through sev-
eral iterations of modification, first to accommodate the
specifics of the dataset being tagged (WordNet glosses
as opposed to open text), and then to refine the han-
dling of WordNet collocations. Prior tagging efforts had
employed the WordNet method of representing colloca-
tions as single word forms, with underscores replacing
the spaces between words. While it is a practical solu-
tion that gives the collocation the same status and repre-
sentational form that it has as an entry in WordNet, by
treating a collocation as a “word”, we lose the fact that it
is decomposable into smaller units. This renders difficult
the coding of discontinuous collocations (that is, colloca-
tions interrupted by one or more intervening words, for
example ‘His performance blew the competition out of
the water’, where “blow out of the water” is a WordNet
collocation). A scheme that enables collocations to be
treated both as individual words and as multi-word units
is therefore desirable, particularly if future parsing passes
need to identify the internal structure of a collocation, as
for distinguishing phrase heads from non-heads.
The smallest structural unit, then, is a word (or piece of
punctuation), marked as &lt;cf&gt; if it is part of a WordNet
collocation, and as &lt;wf&gt; otherwise. Attributes on the
&lt;wf&gt; and &lt;cf&gt; elements identify each form uniquely
in the gloss, and link together the constituent &lt;cf&gt;’s of a
collocation.
The major structural units of a gloss are &lt;def&gt;, &lt;ex&gt;,
and &lt;aux&gt;. &lt;def&gt; contains the definitional portion of
the gloss, the main interest of the tagging task. A &lt;def&gt;
may be followed by one or more &lt;ex&gt;’s, each contain-
ing an example sentence. Auxiliary information,9 coded
as &lt;aux&gt;, may precede or follow the &lt;def&gt;, or occur
within it. Figure 1 shows the marked up gloss for sense
11 of life (the gloss text is “living things collectively;”),
as it looks after preprocessing.
Prior to sense-tagging, the lemma attribute on the
&lt;wf&gt; or head10 &lt;cf&gt; of a collocation is set to all
possible lemma forms, as determined during lemmatiza-
tion (explicated more fully below). After sense-tagging,
the lemma attribute is set to only the lemma of the
word/collocation that it is tagged to, all other options are
deleted. An &lt;id&gt; element representing the sense tag
is inserted as a child of the &lt;wf&gt; (or &lt;cf&gt;), if multi-
9Auxiliary text is a cover term for a range of numeric and
symbolic classes (dates, times, numbers, numeric ranges, mea-
surements, formulas, and the like), and parenthesized and other
secondary text that are inessential to the meaning of a synset.
10“Head” here refers simply to the first word in the collo-
cation, and not the syntactic head. The head &lt;cf&gt; bears the
lemma and sense-tag(s) for the entire collocation.
ple sense-tags are assigned, then multiple &lt;id&gt;’s are as-
signed, one for each tag. Figure 2 shows the sense-tagged
gloss for life.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999264">
3.2 Preprocessing and automatic tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996279069768">
The preprocessing stage segments the gloss into chunks
and tokenizes the gloss contents into words and WordNet
collocations. The tokenization pass isolates word forms
and disambiguates lexical from non-lexical punctuation.
Lexical punctuation is retained as part of the word form,
non-lexical punctuation is encoded as ignorable &lt;wf&gt;’s.
Abbreviations and acronyms are recognized, contractions
split, and stop list and wait list forms are handled. All
&lt;wf&gt;’s other than punctuation are lemmatized, that is,
they are reduced to their WordNet entry form using an in-
house tool, moan11, that was developed for this purpose.
Part of speech is not disambiguated during preprocess-
ing, therefore lemmatizing assigns all potential lemma
forms for all part of speech classes that moan returns for
the token. Part of speech disambiguation will occur as a
side-effect of sense-tagging, avoiding the introduction of
errors related to POS-tagging. Lemmatizing serves two
functions, first when searching the database of glosses
for the term being tagged, and then when displaying the
sense choices for a particular instance.
The targeted tagging approach introduces the problem
of locating all inflected forms of the word/collocation to
be tagged. Rather than build a tool to generate inflected
forms, our solution was to pre-lemmatize the corpus and
search on the lemma forms, on the assumption that while
the search will overgenerate matches, it will not miss any.
Locating alternations in hyphenation will be handled in a
similar way, via the pre-indexing of alternate forms of
hyphenated words/collocations in WordNet.
The ignorable text classifier recognizes ignorable text
as described earlier, chunking multi-word terms and as-
signing attributes indicating semantic class. The markup
will enable them to be treated as individual words or, al-
ternatively, as a single form indicating the class, which
will be of use should further parsing or semantic process-
ing of the glosses be called for.
The WordNet collocation recognizer, or globber, uses a
bag-of-words approach to locate multi-word forms in the
glosses. First, all possible collocations are pulled from
the WordNet database. This list is then filtered by sev-
eral criteria designed to exclude candidates that cannot
be accurately identified automatically. The largest class
of excluded words is that of phrasal verbs, which cannot

easily be distinguished from verbs followed by preposi-
tions heading prepositional phrases.12 Many of these will
be globbed by hand in the early stages of manual tagging.
From this list of excluded words, we also generate a list
of collocations that contain monosemous words. This list
will later be used to prevent those words from being erro-
neously tagged in the automatic sense-tagging stage. The
final list of words to be automatically globbed also takes
into account variations in hyphenation and capitalization.
Once the list is completed, the next step is to create an
index of the glosses referenced by the lemmatized forms
they contain. For each collocation, the globber calculates
the intersection of the lists of glosses containing its con-
stituent word forms. This list of possible collocations is
then ordered by gloss.
The final step of the globber iterates through each of
the glosses, three passes per gloss. The first pass marks
the monosemous words found in excluded collocations,
without globbing the collocation. Pass two identifies
multi-word forms that appear as consecutive &lt;wf&gt;’s in
the text. The final pass attempts to locate disjoint collo-
cations that follow certain set patterns of usage, such as
“ribbon, bull, and garter snakes”, where “ribbon snake”,
“bull snake”, and “garter snake” are all in WordNet.
“Garter snake” is globbed in pass two, and parallel struc-
ture helps identify “ribbon snake” and “bull snake” in the
third pass.
After preprocessing is complete, the automatic sense
tagger tags monosemous &lt;wf&gt;’s and &lt;cf&gt;’s to their
WordNet senses. Words and collocations tagged by the
automatic tagger are distinguished from manually tagged
terms by an attribute in the markup.
Sense-tagging the glosses to WordNet senses presup-
poses that all words used in the glosses (and all senses
used of those words) exist as entries. The preprocess-
ing and auto-tagging phase will therefore include a few
dry runs to identify any typographical errors and words
not covered, errors will be fixed and open class words or
word senses will be added to WordNet as necessary.

the current tag or tags lie above the final text box, which
is used to display and select the WordNet sense or senses
for the current word.
The tag status of each word or collocation in the gloss
and example boxes is indicated through the use of color,
font, and highlighting. Orange text indicates a term that
has been automatically tagged, red type denotes a manu-
ally tagged word, words marked as ignorable are shown
in black, and the remainder of the taggable text is blue.
Words that are part of a collocation are underlined, and
forms that match the targeted search term are bolded. The
current selection is highlighted in yellow.
There are several ways to navigate the glosses. For tar-
geted tagging, the user chooses one or more senses, then
clicks the ‘Tag’ button, assigning those senses and auto-
matically jumping to the next untagged instance of the
search word. Other buttons allow movement to the next
or previous instance of the search term without altering
the tag status of the current selection. The interface was
designed with targeted tagging in mind, but the user can
switch between targeted and sequential modes, to fix an
improperly tagged word.
The interface allows a user to filter the displayed senses
by part of speech, to concentrate on the relevant options.
When context is insufficient to fully disambiguate, a word
or collocation can be tagged to more than one sense or to
a WordNet verb group. To prevent bias caused by the
order of the displayed senses, each time a new targeted
search term is entered, the senses shown in the sense box
are shuffled after being grouped by part of speech.
During the targeted tagging process, the interface also
enables a user to easily inspect and change the sense tags
assigned to words other than the search term. The inter-
face will display a box containing a tagged word’s senses
when the cursor is placed over it, providing useful infor-
mation for disambiguating the search term. Additionally,
if the user notices a tagging error, the mis-tagged word
can be selected for editing. Errors and omissions of glob-
bing can be corrected in a similar fashion. To “un-glob”
a collocation, one need only click on the collocation and
click on the “un-glob” button. To group separate &lt;wf&gt;s
into a new collocation, a user can select each constituent
form with the mouse and click the “glob” button. The in-
terface will then provide a list of potential lemmas for the
collocation, from which the user can select the appropri-
ate choice.

WordNet currently consists of 146,000 lexemes orga-
nized into more than 116,000 synsets. There are over
117,000 bidirectional links comprising the hyponymy,
troponymy, and meronymy hierarchies, and 4,000 bidi-
rectional antonym links. Once completed, the sense-
tagged glosses will contribute an estimated 800,000 links
to the network, increasing the internal connectivity and
associating words with related concepts that cut across
grammatical class and hierarchy. From the synset for a
word, the synsets for all conceptually-related words used
in its gloss can be accessed via their sense tags. From
those synsets, hierarchical and other semantic links can
be followed, as well the sense tags in those glosses, sit-
uating the word in an ever-expanding network of links.
The sense-tagged glosses will provide an additional di-
mension of meaning not expressible by purely hierarchi-
cal relations. The hierarchical structure of WordNet rep-
resents sense distinctions that stem from a polysemous
word’s distinct superordinates (paradigmatic difference).
Not represented are a word’s syntagmatic properties—
the ways in which meaning is constrained by the differ-
ing contexts in which a polysemous word appears. The
sense-tagged glosses, taken as a corpus of disambiguated
contexts for a word, provide just that.
NLP needs high-quality sense-tagged corpora and
sense inventories. The project currently underway is a
step towards providing both in one integrated lexical re-
source.

The problem of ambiguity persists even in limited domains, thus the necessity for wide-coverage inventories of senses (dictionaries) and corpora sense-tagged to them. WordNet has been used extensively for WSD, for both its broad coverage and its large network of semantic relations. In this paper, we present a report on the state of our current endeavor to increase the connectivity of WordNet through sense-tagging the glosses, the result of which will be to create a more integrated lexical resource.</abstract>

The difficulties inherent in the sense-tagging task include the order in which words are presented to tag, a word’s degree of polysemy and part of speech, vagueness of the context, the order in which senses are presented, granularity of the senses, and level of expertise of the person doing the tagging. Each will be addressed briefly in the following sections. 2.1 Targeted vs. sequential or ‘lexical’ vs. ‘textual’ There are two approaches one can take to the order in which words are tagged. In the sequential approach, termed ‘textual’ by Kilgarriff (1998), the tagger proceeds through the text one word at a time, assigning the contextappropriate sense to each open class word as it is encountered. The targeted approach (‘lexical’ in Kilgarriff’s terms) involves tagging all corpus instances of a pre-selected word, jumping through the text to each occurrence.

We feel the most accurate results can be obtained from the targeted approach using linguistically-trained taggers. The nature of the glosses (relatively short, completely self-contained) means that a fairly restricted context will need to be assimilated for each instance of a token, eliminating one factor of difficulty associated with the targeted approach. Since a definition is, by definition, unambiguous, the context provided by a gloss should, in theory, never be insufficient to di</context>

By virtue of being located within the synset, the exemplified form is in effect automatically disambiguated—it’s just a matter of assigning the tag. 7In WordNet terminology, a collocation is a superordinate term for a variety of multi-word forms, including, but not restricted to, names, compounds, phrasal verbs, and idiomatic phrases. 8Insofar as meaning is defined in part by use. 3.1 The glosstag DTD Development of the formal model for the sense-tagged glosses took the DTD from the SEMCOR project as a starting point (Landes et al., 1998). It went through several iterations of modification, first to accommodate the specifics of the dataset being tagged (WordNet glosses as opposed to open text), and then to refine the handling of WordNet collocations. Prior tagging efforts had employed the WordNet method of representing collocations as single word forms, with underscores replacing the spaces between words. While it is a practical solution that gives the collocation the same status and representational form that it has as an entry in WordNet, by treating a collocation as a “word”, we lose the fact that it is decomposable into sm</context>

In this paper, we present a report on the state of our current endeavor to increase the connectivity of WordNet through sense-tagging the glosses, the result of which will be to create a more integrated lexical resource. 1 Introduction High-quality lexical resources are needed to both train and evaluate Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems. The problem of ambiguity persists even in limited domains, thus the necessity for wide-coverage inventories of senses (dictionaries) and corpora sense-tagged to them. WordNet (Miller et al., 1990; Fellbaum, ed., 1998) has been used extensively for WSD, both for its broad coverage and its large network of semantic relations. Entries in WordNet have, until now, been organized primarily around the semantic relations of synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy/troponymy, meronymy, and a few others which hold mainly among lexicalized concepts and word forms of the same grammatical class.1 The noun and verb networks have been predominantly hierarchi1The exceptions have been the links existing between adjectives derivationally related to nouns or verbs (conceptual is related to concept and conceptuality</context>

In the sequential approach, termed ‘textual’ by Kilgarriff (1998), the tagger proceeds through the text one word at a time, assigning the contextappropriate sense to each open class word as it is encountered. The targeted approach (‘lexical’ in Kilgarriff’s terms) involves tagging all corpus instances of a pre-selected word, jumping through the text to each occurrence. The corpora produced by the SEMCOR and READER projects were tagged sequentially; the Kilo and HECTOR projects used the targeted approach (Kilo and READER are described in Miller et al. (1998), HECTOR in Atkins (1993), and SEMCOR in Fellbaum, ed. (1998)). In sequential tagging, the tagger is following the narrative, and so has the meaning of the text in mind when selecting senses for each new word encountered (context is foremost). In targeted tagging, the tagger has the various meanings of the word in mind when presented with each new context (sense distinctions are foremost). In their comparisons of the two approaches, Fellbaum et al. (2003) and Kilgarriff (1998) both conclude that sequential tagging increases the difficulty of the task by requiring the tagger to acquaint (and th</context>
