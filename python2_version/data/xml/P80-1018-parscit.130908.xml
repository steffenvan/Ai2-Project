This paper reports on some of the components of person
to person communication mediated by computer conferenc-
ing systems. Transcripts from two systems were
analysed: the Electronic Information and Exchange
System (ETES), based at the New Jersey Institute of
Technology; and Planet, based at Infomedia Inc. in
Palo Alto, California. The research focused upon
the ways in which expressive communication is encoded
by users of the mediuml.

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923793103448">
The term paralanguage is used broadly in this report.
It includes those vocal features outlined by Trager
(1964) as well as the prosodic system of Crystal (1969).
Both are concerned with the investigation of linguistic
phenomena which generally fall outside the boundaries
of phonology, morphology and lexical analysis. These
phenomena are the voice qualities and tones which
communicate expressive feelings, indicate the age,
health and sex of a speaker, modify the meanings of
words, and help to regulate interaction between speak-
ers.
Paralanguage becomes an issue in print communication
when individuals attempt to transcribe (and analyse)
an oral presentation, or write a script which is to be
delivered orally. In addition, paralinguistic analysis
can be directed towards forms of print which mimic or
contain elements of oral communication. These include
comic strips, novels, graffitti, and computer confer-
encing (see Crystal and Davy 1969).
The research reported here is not concerned with a
direct comparison between face-to-face and computer
mediated communication. Such a comparison is useful,
e.g. it can help us to understand how one form borrows
elements from the other (see section 5.), or aid in
the selection of the medium which is more appropriate
for a given task. However, the intent here is simpler:
to isolate some of the paralinguistic features which
are present in computer mediated communication and to
begin to map the patterning of those features.

2. THE FRAME
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995873833333333">
Computer conferencing may be described as a frame of
social activity in Goffman&apos;s terms (1974). The computer
conferencing frame is characterized by an exchange of
print communication between or among individuals. That
is, it may involve person to person or person to group
communication. The information is typed on a computer
terminal, transmitted via a telephone line to a central
computer where it is processed and stored until the
intended receiver (also using a computer terminal and
a telephone line) enters the system. The received
information is either printed on paper or displayed on
a television screen. The exchange can be in real time,
if the users are on the system simultaneously and
linked together in a common notepad. More typically,
the exchange is asynchronous with several hours or a
few days lapse between sending and receiving.
In all of the transcripts examined for this study, the
composer of the message typed it into the system.
Further, the systems were used for many purposes:
1. The research was supported by DREW Grant No. 54-P-
71362/2/2-01
simple message sending (electronic mail), task related
conferencing, and fun (e.g. jokes and conferences on
popular topics). Bills for usage were paid by the
organizations involved, not the individuals themselves.
These elements within the frame may affect the style of
interaction.
One concern in frame analysis is to understand differen-
ces in a situation which make a difference. Clearly,
there is a need to investigate conditions not included
in this study in order to gain a broader understanding
of paralinguistic usage. Among the conditions which
might make a difference are: the presence of a secretary
in the flow of information; usage based upon narrow
task communications only; and situations where there is
a direct cost to the user.

3. FEATURES
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.956316476190476">
The following elements have been isolated within the
transcripts and given a preliminary designation as
paralinguistic features.
3.1. VOCAL SPELLING
These features include non standard spellings of words
which bring attention to sound qualities. The spelling
may serve to mark a regional accent or an idiosyncratic
manner of speech. Often, the misspelling involves
repetition of a vowel (drawl) or a final consonant
(released or held consonant, with final stress). In
addition, there are many examples of non standard con-
tractions. A single contraction in a message appears
to bring attention (stress) to the word. A series of
contractions in a single message appears to serve as a
tempo marker, indicating a quick pace in composing the
message.

<bodyText confidence="0.965594">
Some of the spellings shown above can occur through a
glitch in the system or an unintended error by the
composer of the message. Typically, the full context
helps the reader to discern if the spelling was
intentional.
3.2. LEXICAL SURROGATES
Often, people use words to describe their &amp;quot;tone of
voice&amp;quot; in the message. This may be inserted as a
parenthetical comment within a sentence, in which case
it is likely to mark that sentence alone. Alternative-
ly, it may be located at the beginning or end of a
message. In these instances, it often provides a tone
for the entire message.
In addition, vocal segregates (e.g. uh huh, hmmm, yuk
yuk) are written commonly within the body of texts.

3.3. SPATIAL ARRAYS
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.997625761904762">
Perhaps the most striking feature of computer confer-
encing is the spatial arrangement of words. While
some users borrow a standard letter format, others
treat the page space as a canvass on which they paint
with words and letters, or an advertisement layout
in which they are free to leave space between words,
skip lines, and paragraph each new sentence.
Some spatial arrays are actual graphics: arrangements
of letters to create a picture. Hiltz and Turoff (1978)
note the heavy use of graphics at Christmas time,
when people send greeting cards through the conferencing
system. In day to day messaging, users often leave
space between words (indicating pause, or setting off
a word or phrase), run words together (quickening of
tempo, onomatopoeic effect), skip lines within a
paragraph (to setoff a word, phrase or sentence), and
create paragraphs to lend visual support to the entire
message or items within it. In addition, many messages
contain headlines, as in newspaper writing.

3.4. MANIPULATION OF GRAMMATICAL MARKERS
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998735842105263">
Grammatical markers such as capitalization, periods,
commas, quotation marks, and parentheses are manipulated
by users to add stress, indicate pause, modify the tone
of a lexical item and signal a change of voice by the
composer. For example, a user will employ three
exclamation marks at the end of a sentence to lend
intensity to his point. A word in the middle of a
sentence (or one sentence in a message) will be
capitalized and thereby receive stress. A series of
das: ,s between syllables of a word can serve to hold
the preceding syllable and indicate stress upon it or
the succeeding syllable. Parentheses and quotation
marks are used commonly to indicate that the words
contained within them are to be heard with a different
tone than the rest of the message. A series of periods
are used to indicate pause, as well as to indicate
internal and terminal junctures. For example, in some
messages, composers do not use commas. At points where
a comma is appropriate, three periods are employed. At
the end of the sentence, several periods (the number
can vary from 4 to more than 20) are used. This system
indicates to the reader both the grammatical boundary
and the length of pause between words.
The Electronic Information and Exchange System employs
some of these grammatical marker manipulations in the
interface between user and system. For example, they
instruct a user to respond with question marks when he
does not know what to do at a command point. One
question mark indicates &amp;quot;I don&apos;t understand what EIES
wants here,&amp;quot; and will yield a brief explanation from
the system. Two question marks indicate &amp;quot;I am very
confused&amp;quot; and yield a longer explanation. Three ques-
tion marks indicate &amp;quot;I am totally lost&amp;quot; and put the user
in direct touch with the system monitor.

3.5. MINUS FEATURES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989485">
The absence of certain features or expected work in
composition may also lend a tone to the message. For
example, a user may not correct spelling errors or
glitches introduced by the system. Similarly, he may
pay no attention to paragraphing or capitalization. The
absence of such features, particularly if they are
clustered together in a single message, can convey a
relaxed tone of familiarity with the receiver or quick-
ness of pacing (e.g. when the sender has a lot of work
to do and must compose the message quickly).
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.675557" genericHeader="method">
4. PATTERNING OF FEATURES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999853625">
It can be noted, first, that some features mark a short
syllabic or polysyllabic segment (e.g. capitalization,
contraction, and vocal segregates), while others mark
full sentences or the entire message (e.g. a series of
exclamation points, letter graphics, or an initial
parenthetical comment). Second, it is revealing that
many of these features have an analogic structure: in
some manner, they are like the tone they represent.
For example, a user may employ more or fewer periods,
more or fewer question marks to indicate degrees of
pause or degrees of perplexity. Paralanguage in every-
day conversation is highly analogic and represents
feelings, moods and states of health which do not
(apparently) lend themselves to the digital structure of
words.
Paralinguistic features in computer conferencing occur,
often, at points of change in a message: change of pace,
change of topic, change of tone. In addition, many of
the features rely upon a contrastive structure to
communicate meaning. That is, a message which is typed
in all caps does not communicate greater intensity or
stress. Capitalization must occur contrastively over
one or two words in an otherwise normal sentence
or over one or two sentences in a message which contains
some normal capitalization.
Most paralinguistic featIres can have more than one
meaning. Reviewed in is lation, a feature might indi-
cate a relaxed tone, an intimate relation with the
receiver, or simply sloppiness in composition. Readers
must rely upon the surrounding context (both words and
other paralinguistic features) to narrow the range of
possible meanings.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999698">
The intended receiver of a message, as well as an
outsider who attempts to analyse transcripts, must cope
with the interpretation of paralinguistic features.
Initially, the reader must distinguish glitches in the
system and unintended typing errors from intentional
use of repetition, spacing, etc. Subsequently, the
reader must examine the immediate context of the feature
and compare the usage with similar patterns in the
same message, in other messages by the composer, and/or
in other messages by the general population of users.

5. DEVELOPMENT OF A CODE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999768270270271">
The findings presented in this study are taken from a
limited set of contexts. For this reason, they must
be regarded as a first approximation of paralinguistic
code structure in computer conferencing. Moreover, the
findings do not suggest that a clear code exists for
the community of users. Rather, the code appears to
be in a stage of development and learning.
The study has helped to define some differences among
users which appear to make a difference in the para—
linguistic features they employ. In the corpus of
transcripts examined, usage varied between new and
experienced participants, as well as between infrequent
and frequent participants. Generally, experienced and
frequent participants employed more paralinguistic
features. However, idiosyncratic patterns appear to
be more important in determining usage. The findings
serve more to define questions for subsequent study
than to provide answers about user variations.
In addition, it is clear that the characteristics of
the computer terminals (TI 745s, primarily), as well
as system characteristics, provided many of the compon—
ents or &amp;quot;bricks&amp;quot; with which paralinguistic features
were constructed. For example, the repeat key on the
terminal allowed users to create certain forms of
graphics. Also, star keys, dollar signs, colons and
other available keys were employed to communicate
paralinguistic information. System terms to describe a
mode of operation (e.g. notepad, scratchpad, message,
conference) may also influence development of a code
of usage by suggesting a more formal or informal
exchange.
Finally, it may be noted that early in their usage,
some participants appeared to borrow formats from other
media with which they were familiar (e.g. business
letters, telegrams, and telephone conversations). Over
time, patterns of usage converged somewhat. However,
idiosyncratic variation remained strong.

6. CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988626">
A few conclusions can be drawn from this study. First,
the presence of paralinguistic features in computer
conferencing and the effort by users to communicate
more information than can be carried by the words
themselves, suggest that people feel it is important
to be able to communicate tonal and expressive informa—
tion. Second, it is not easy to communicate this
information. Users must work in computer conferencing
to communicate information about their feelings and
state of health which naturally accompanies speech.
While there does not appear to be a unified and identi—
fiable code of paralinguistic features within confer—
encing systems or among users of the systems, the
collective behavior of participants may be creating
one.
