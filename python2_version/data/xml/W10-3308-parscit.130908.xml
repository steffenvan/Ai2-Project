1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.917524727272727">
Many Semantic Web applications need a
much deeper semantic analysis of the text
than is used today. Not only should the
ontology elements be extracted from the
textual data but also it is important to
interpret the text in terms of the ontology. It
is essential that IE and QA systems should be
able to discover semantic similarity between
the texts if they express the meaning in
different ways. Cf. synonymous sentences (1)
– (3):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996615857142857">
(1) Real Madrid and Barcelona will meet in
the semi-finals on Thursday.
(2) The semi-final match between Real
Madrid and Barcelona will take place on
Thursday.
(3) The adversary of Real Madrid in the semi-
finals on Thursday will be Barcelona.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.943636911764706">
If we wish to extract the meaning from the
text irrespective of the way it is conveyed, we
should construct a semantic analyzer capable
of producing identical semantic structures for
sentences (1)-(3), or at least semantic
structures whose equivalence can be easily
demonstrated.
The problem becomes much more difficult
if text understanding includes access to text-
external world knowledge. For example,
sentences (1)-(3) describe the same situation
as (4).
(4) The semi-finals on Thursday will see the
champion of the UEFA Champions League
2008-2009 and the team of Manuel Pelle-
grini.
To account for this synonymy, the system
should know that it was the football club
Barcelona who won the UEFA Champions
League in 2008-2009, and that Manuel Pelle-
grini is the coach of Real Madrid. This im-
plies that linguistic knowledge should be
linked with ontological resources. The crea-
tion of a semantic analyzer of this type goes
far beyond the task of assigning ontological
classes to words occurring in the text. It re-
quires a powerful wide-coverage linguistic
processor capable of building coherent se-
mantic structures, a knowledge-extensive
lexicon, which contains different types of
lexical information, an ontology, which de-
scribes objects in the domain and their prop-
erties, a repository of ground-level facts, and
an inference engine.

A project NOVOFUT aiming at the devel-
opment of a semantic analyzer of this type for
Russian texts has started at the Institute for
Information Transmission Problems of the
Russian Academy of Sciences. It covers the
domain of news about football. There are
several reasons for this choice of domain.
First, the news texts are written primarily for
the general public, so that their understanding
does not require specialized expert knowl-
edge. This is a major advantage since it sig-
nificantly facilitates the acquisition of the
ontology. Second, the language typical of
sports journalism is rich enough, which
makes its interpretation linguistically non-
trivial. Last but not least, sports enjoy enor-
mous public interest. There are many sports
portals publishing multifarious information
on the daily (and sometimes hourly) basis and
visited by a lot of people. Enhanced Ques-
tion-Answering and Information Extraction in
this domain are likely to attract many users.
The NOVOFUT semantic analyzer reuses
many types of resources created or accumu-
lated by the team in previous work. In this
paper we focus on the static resources used
by the analyzer – the lexicon and the ontol-
ogy. The plan of the presentation is as fol-
lows. In Section 2 we discuss related work. In
Section 3 we will briefly describe the linguis-
tic processor we build on and its lexicon. Sec-
tion 4 outlines a small-scale ontology devel-
oped for the project. The correlation between
natural language words as presented in the
lexicon and the ontology is the main concern
of Section 5. In Section 6 the interface be-
tween the ontology and the lexicon is dis-
cussed. Future work is outlined in Section 7.

The link between the ontologies and NL texts
is investigated in two directions – “from the
ontology towards NL texts” and “from the
texts towards the ontology”. In the first case
written texts are used as a means for ontology
extension and population. To name but a few
authors, McDowell and Cafarella (2006) start
from an ontology and specify web searches
that identify in the texts possible semantic
instances, relations, and taxonomic informa-
tion. In (Schutz and Buitelaar 2005) an inter-
esting attempt is made to extract ontological
relations from texts. (Buitelaar et al. 2008,
Magnini et al. 2006, Maynard &amp; al. 2006) are
further advances in the direction of ontology
population.
Finding NL equivalents to ontological
elements and be monolingual or multilingual.
A metamodel for linking conceptual knowl-
edge with its lexicalizations in various lan-
guages is proposed in (Montiel-Ponsoda et al.
2007).
The second direction research starts from
NL texts and tries to interpret them in terms
of the ontology. In most cases, this takes the
form of marking the text with ontological
classes and instances. A typical example is
(Sanfilippo et al. 2006). One should also
mention the work based on the Generalized
Upper Model (GUM), which is meant for in-
terfacing between domain models and NL
components (Bateman et al. 1995)
Our work belongs to this second direction,
but our aim is not limited to finding ontologi-
cal correlates to words. In many aspects we
were inspired by the ontological semantic
approach developed in the Mikrokosmos
framework (cf. Nirenburg and Raskin 2004).
We share many of its postulates and concrete
solutions. In particular, semantic analysis of
the text should be based on both linguistic
and extra-linguistic knowledge. Linguistic
knowledge is implemented in language
grammars and dictionaries, while extra-
linguistic knowledge is comprised in an on-
tology, which enumerates concepts, describes
their properties and states interrelationships
between them, and a fact repository which
accumulates ground-level facts, such as, in
our case, the data about concrete players,
teams and matches. To a large extent, the on-
tology serves as the semantic language for
meaning representation.
At the same time, there exist some differ-
ences between our approaches determined by
the linguistic model adopted. Our work is
based on the Meaning ⇔ Text theory
(Mel’čuk 1974, 1996). In particular, we make
extensive use of lexical functions, which con-
stitute one of the prominent features of this
theory. Thanks to lexical functions it turns
out possible to reduce a wider range of syn-
onymous sentences to the same semantic

structure, and in many cases, improve the per-
formance of search engines (see e.g. Apresjan
et al. 2009). Another difference between the
Mikrokosmos approach and ours concerns the
fact that the Mikrokosmos ontology is written
in a specific in-house formalism. Our empha-
sis is on using as far as possible standard on-
tology languages (OWL, SWRL), in order to
obtain interoperability with a wide and ever
growing range of semantic web resources and
inference engines.

of language modelling.

1) a rule-based machine translation system
working both ways between Russian and

rean and Arabic);
2) a system of synonymous and quasi-
synonymous paraphrasing of sentences;
3) an environment for deep annotation of
text corpora, in which SynTagRus, the only
corpus of Russian texts tagged morphologi-
cally, syntactically (in the dependency tree
formalism), and lexically was created, and

<bodyText confidence="0.999960487179487">
The ETAP-3 processor is largely based on
the general linguistic framework of the Mean-
ing ⇔ Text theory by Mel’čuk. An important
complement to this theory was furnished by
the theory of systematic lexicography and
integrated description of language proposed
by Jurij Apresjan (2000).
One of the major resources used in ETAP-
3 is the combinatorial dictionary. It offers
ample and diverse data for each lexical entry.
In particular, the entry may list the word’s
syntactic and semantic features, its subcate-
gorization frames, as well as rules (or refer-
ence to rules) of a dozen types, which make it
possible to describe peculiar behavior of in-
dividual words and exceptions to general
rules in a complete and consistent way. Many
dictionary entries contain information on
lexical functions, to be discussed below in
some detail.
The entry of the combinatorial dictionary
has a number of zones, one of which provides
the properties of the word that are manifested
in the given language, while all the other
zones contain information on the match be-
tween this word and its equivalent in a par-
ticular language. For example, the EN zone in
the Russian combinatorial dictionary entry
contains information on the translational
equivalents of the respective Russian word
into English. One field (TRANS) gives the
default single-word translation (or several
such translations) of this word in English.
Other fields contain less trivial translation
rules, or references to such rules.
A newly introduced ONTO zone offers in-
formation underlying the match between the
Russian word and its counterparts in the on-
tology.

4 Ontology of football.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999896">
The ontology we are working with focuses in
the first place on football. It contains infor-
mation on teams, players, football field, sport
events, and their properties. However, we
want it to be extendable to other sports as
well. That is why some classes are more gen-
eral than would be needed for football alone.
For example, instead of having one class
FootballPlayer, the ontology has a
more general class Sportsman, of which
FootballPlayer is a subclass. An
equivalence restriction states that Foot-
ballPlayer is a Sportsman whose
SportType is football. In this way,
sportsmen doing different types of sports can
be treated by the ontology in a uniform way.
The football ontology is written in SWRL,
which is OWL augmented with rules (Hor-
rocks et al. 2004). In compiling it, we used
some existing ontologies dealing with foot-

<bodyText confidence="0.995452288888889">
ball
(http://www.lgi2p.ema.fr/~ranwezs/ontologie
s/soccerV2.0.daml). As usual, properties of
classes are inherited by the subclasses. For
example, the Match class is a subclass of
SportEvent, which in its turn is a subclass
of Event. Match inherits from Event the
properties of having definite Time and
Place. From SportEvent it inherits the
fact that its participants should be Sport-
Agents. Its own properties are: the number
of participants is 2 (as opposed to champion-
ships, which have more) and it has a definite
sport type (as opposed to Olympics, which
involve many sport types). A subclass of
Match is Derby, in which both participants
should be from the same city or region. This
property is implemented by means of a
SWRL rule (cf. below). Another rule as-
signed to Match states that if its sport type is
football (or any other team sport), then its
participants should be teams and not individ-
ual sportsmen, as is the case in tennis or
chess. Sportsman is a subclass of two
classes: Person, from which it inherits the
property of having a name and a birth date,
and SportAgent, which includes also
Team and from which it inherits the property
of having a definite sport type and a coach.
5 Correlation between the
words and the elements of the on-
tology.
As mentioned above, the ontology plays a
two-fold role. On the one hand, it is a reposi-
tory of domain-specific knowledge, and on
the other hand, it is a semantic metalanguage
used for representing the meaning of natural
language texts. All meaningful natural lan-
guages elements (words, grammatical con-
structions, morphological features) must be
interpreted in ontological terms. This makes
the correlation between the lexicon and the
ontology far from trivial. In this section, we
will present several typical situations and il-
lustrate them with examples.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.468733">
5.1 One-to-one correspondence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9342535">
between NL words and ontology
elements.
The simplest situation occurs when a word
directly corresponds to an ontology element –
a class, an individual, a relation, an attribute
or its value. Example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989038">
(5) Real Madrid pobedil Arsenal so sčetom
3:1 ‘Real Madrid defeated Arsenal 3 to 1’.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998656142857143">
Here Real Madrid and Arsenal are indi-
viduals – instances of the Team class, the
verb to defeat corresponds to the WinEvent
class, and numbers 3 and 1 are values of at-
tributes scoreWinner and scoreLoser,
respectively. In the semantic structure (SemS)
classes are represented by instances supplied
by a unique numeric identifier. SemS for sen-
tence (5) looks as follows:
hasWinner(WinEvent01, Real-
Madrid)&amp;hasLoser(WinEvent01,
Arsenal)&amp; scoreWinner
(WinEvent01,3)&amp;
scoreLoser(WinEvent01,1)
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.854632">
5.2 One ontology element –
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998082133333333">
several words (“multi-word con-
cepts”).
This is a very typical situation, especially in
the area of terminology. For example, in or-
dinary language želtaja kartočka ‘a yellow
card’ is a free noun phrase that simply de-
notes a card whose colour is yellow. In the
sports domain, it is a single concept that re-
fers to one of several possible punishments a
referee can mete out for a rules infraction.
Therefore, it is represented as one element in
the ontology. Some other examples of multi-
word sport concepts: uglovoj udar ‘corner’,
svobodnyj udar ‘free kick’, pravyj po-
luzaščitnik ‘right tackle’.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.6472655">
5.3 One word – several onto-
logical elements.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964375">
Many words that can be interpreted in terms
of ontological elements do not correspond to
any single class, relation or instance. Their
definition consists in a configuration of these
elements. Most often, it is a class with some
of the properties instantiated. In principle,
often there are two options: one can either
postulate two different classes (e.g.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990148">
70
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999268125">
Sportsman and FootballPlayer as its
subclass), or only one class (Sportsman)
and represent the football player as a
Sportsman whose SportType property is
football. There is no general solution to
this alternative. In general, it is desirable to
obtain a parsimonious ontology and refrain
from introducing new classes, if one can de-
fine a concept in terms of existing classes and
their properties. However, if a concept has
important properties of its own, it is prefer-
able to present it in the ontology as a separate
class. In our example, FootballPlayer
has Specialization which other sports-
men do not have (goalkeeper, for-
ward, back, etc.) For this reason, it is pos-
tulated as a separate class of the ontology,
with the indication of its equivalence to the
anonymous class “Sportsman and
hasSportType football”.
An interesting and typical case are adjecti-
val modifiers to nouns of the type ispanskij
‘Spanish’, francuzskij ‘French’, moskovskij
‘of Moscow’, and the like. Usually, dictionar-
ies provide a very general definition of such
words. For example, the COBUILD English
dictionary gives only one meaning for the
adjective Spanish: ‘belonging or relating to
Spain, or to its people, language or culture’.
However, in real life situations this word is
often interpreted by the speakers in a more
specific way, according to the context. Onto-
logical description should try, as far as possi-
ble, to take contextual factors into account
and make explicit the specific interpretation
of the modifier in each particular case. Some-
times, it can be done by means of rules that
refer to ontological categories. For example,
the meaning of the adjective ispanskij ‘Span-
ish’ mentioned above, when applied to geo-
graphical objects (rivers, cities, mountains,
roads, etc.), narrows down to (hasLoca-
tion Spain). If this adjective modifies a
noun denoting an industrial or agricultural
product (car, wine, olive oil, etc.), it is rather
interpreted as (producedIn Spain).
We will hardly understand the phrase Spanish
wine as denoting the wine located in Spain.
Textual objects (songs, literature, poetry,
etc.) move the adjective towards denoting the
Spanish language: (inLanguage Span-
ish). Of course, these rules are not always
sufficient for disambiguation. If an object
falls into more than one category, several in-
terpretations are possible. In particular, a
book is both a textual and a consumer object.
Therefore, a Spanish book can be interpreted
as a book written in Spanish, and as a book
published in Spain.
In many cases, adjectives serve as argu-
ments of nouns. The semantic role of this ar-
gument may be different for different nouns
(cf. (6-8)), and even for the same noun (cf.
(9-11)):
</bodyText>

president’: hasAd-
dressee(advisor,president).
5.4 A word is interpreted in on-
tological terms but does not have any
fixed ontological equivalent.
There is a large class of words that denote
individuals which are in a certain relation to
other individuals: brother, sister, uncle, wife,
friend, enemy, classmate, co-author, co-
regent, coeval, adversary, ally, etc. Of
course, these words can be easily represented
as ontology properties: has-
Brother(John, Bill), hasSis-
ter(John, Mary). However, such rep-
resentation does not reveal the meaning of the
concepts. Being a brother of somebody means
being a male and having common parents
with this person. This meaning shares the
second component (‘having common par-
ents’) with the property of being a sister and
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997072">
71
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99971">
differs from it in the first component (‘being
a male’). Such a definition of meanings re-
quires the use of variables. This is the point
where the OWL expressive capacity is insuf-
ficient and one has to recur to SWRL rules:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998601">
Person(?person1)&amp;Gender (?per-
son1,male)&amp;hasParent(?person1,
?person3) &amp;hasParent (?per-
son2,?person3)→
brother(?person1, ?person2)
Person(?person1)&amp;Gender (?per-
son1,female)&amp;hasParent(?person
1, ?person3)&amp; hasParent (?per-
son2,?person3)→ sis-
ter(?person1,?person2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995722">
In a similar way one can define the concept
of adversary (in sports), as used for example
in sentence (3) above. Adversary of Z is
someone different from Z who plays in the
same match as Z:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.988782">
SportAgent(?agent)&amp;
Match(?match)&amp; hasPartici-
pant(?match,?agent)&amp; hasPar-
ticipant(?match,?z)&amp; differ-
entFrom(?agent,?z) → adver-
sary(?agent,?z)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.938794692307692">
Among the words that require variables for
their ontological definition are not only rela-
tional nouns. There are many other words that
cannot be translated into ontological catego-
ries without claiming identity (or difference)
of the properties of some individuals. Here
are some examples from the football domain.
A derby is a match whose participants are
from the same city or region. Our ontology
defines the concept of derby as follows:
hasParticipant(?match, ?par-
ticipant1)&amp; hasParticipant

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995170625">
Pobednyj gol (‘decisive goal’) is a goal
which was scored when both teams had equal
score and which was the last goal in the
match. However, since having no subsequent
goals cannot be expressed in SWRL we will
convey this idea by saying that the goal
brought the victory in the match to one of the
teams. We will need the following classes
and properties:
GoalEvent, with the properties:
hasAgent, atMinute, e.g. on the tenth
minute, inMatch, hasResult (inher-
ited from the more general class Event).
SituationInMatch (the score at a
given moment), with the properties: in-
Match, atMinute, scorePartici-
pant1, scoreParticipant2.
WinEvent, with the properties:
hasWinner, hasLoser.
Team, with the property hasPart, to be
filled by instances of Sportsman.
Besides that, we need the property
timeImmediatelyBefore, inherited by
moments of time from Time.
We will describe the situation by means of
two rules. Rule (12) says that the goal that
brought a victory can be called a decisive
goal. Rule (13) complements this description
by saying that if a goal brings a victory, the
winner is the team whose player scored it and
this goal was scored at the moment when
both teams had equal score.

function. A prototypical LF is a triple of ele-
ments {R, X, Y}, where R is a certain general
semantic relation obtaining between the ar-
gument lexeme X (the keyword) and some
other lexeme Y which is the value of R with
regard to X (by a lexeme in this context we
mean either a word in one of its lexical mean-
ings or some other lexical unit, such as a set
expression). Here are some examples for the
Oper1 and Oper2 functions: Oper1 (control) =
exercise (control), Oper1 (research) = do (re-
search), Oper1 (invitation) = issue (an invita-
tion), Oper1 (doubt) = have (doubts), Op-
er1 (defeat) = suffer (a defeat), Oper1 (victory)
= gain (a victory), Oper1 (campaign) = wage
(a campaign), Oper2 (control) = be under

analysis), Oper2 (invitation) = receive (an
invitation), Oper2 (resistance) = encounter
(resistance), Oper2 (respect) = enjoy (re-
spect), Oper2 (obstacle) = face (an obstacle).
Y is often represented by a set of synony-
mous lexemes Y1, Y2, ...., Yn, all of them
being the values of the given LF R with re-
gard to X; e. g., Magn (desire) = strong /
keen / intense / fervent / ardent / overwhelm-
ing. All the LF exponents for each word are
listed in the lexicon.
LFs have a strong potential for advanced
NLP applications. Apresjan et al. (2007)
shows how LFs can be used in parsing, ma-
chine translation, paraphrasing. In parsing,
LFs are used to resolve or reduce syntactic
and lexical ambiguity. The MT system resorts
to LFs to provide idiomatic target language
equivalents for source sentences in which
both the argument and the value of the same
LF are present. The system of paraphrasing
automatically produces one or several syn-
onymous transforms for a given sentence or
phrase by means of universal LF-axioms; for
example: He respects [X] his teachers – He
has [Oper1(S0 (X))] respect [S0 (X)] for his
teachers – He treats [Labor1-2(S0 (X))] his
teachers with respect – His teachers enjoy
[Oper2(S0(X))] his respect. It can be used in a
number of advanced NLP applications rang-
ing from machine translation to authoring and
text planning.
In ontologically-oriented semantic analysis
different LFs are reflected in different ways.
An LF corresponds to an ontological class.
Many LFs represent bundles of words that are
semantically identical or very close and there-
fore can serve as representatives of this com-
mon meaning. We illustrate this with two
closely related LFs (Apresjan et al. 2008).
The meaning covered by LiquFunc0 is ‘to
cause to cease to exist or to be taking place’.
This concept corresponds, in particular, to the
following English verbs: to stop (the aggres-
sion), to lift (the blockade), to dispel (the
clouds), to demolish (the building), to dis-
perse (the crowd), to avert (the danger), to
cure (the disease), to close (the dispute), to
break up (the family), to annul (the law), to
dissolve (the parliament), to denounce (the
treaty), to bridge (the gap). Another LF of the
Liqu family – LiquFact0 – refers to a different
kind of elimination. It means ‘to cause to
cease functioning according to its destina-
tion’. When somebody closes the eyes, they
do not cease to exist, they only stop function-
ing. Some more examples: shut down (the
factory), stop (the car), land (the airplane),
depose (the king), switch off (the lamp), neu-
tralize (the poison), empty (the bucket).
These LFs, along with several dozen oth-
ers, play a significant role not only in text
understanding and generation. They contrib-
ute in an interesting way to one of the crucial
functions of ontologies – inference of implicit
knowledge. Important inference rules can be
easily formulated in terms of LFs: if the
blockade is lifted (=LiquFunc0), it does not
exist any more. Another example of the LF-
based inference (this time it is LF Real1): He
fulfilled (= Real1) the promise to buy a bicycle
→ He bought a bicycle.
It should be emphasized that, given a lexi-
con which contains LF data (which is the case
of our ETAP dictionary), the acquisition of
this part of the ontology is straightforward.
An LF generates an ontological relation.
This case can be illustrated by support verbs
of the Oper-Func-Labor family that attach
one of the arguments to the noun. For exam-
ple, in sentence Father gave me an advice the
subject of the Oper1-support verb to give (fa-
ther) is the Agent of advice, while in The
proposal received much attention the subject
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997364">
73
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.938231387096774">
of the Oper2-support verb to receive (the pro-
posal) is the Object of attention. Other exam-
ples of Oper1 and Oper2 were given in 5.5
above. Some examples of other LFs of this
family:
Func1: (fear) possesses (somebody), (ru-
mour) reaches (somebody), (the blame) falls
on (somebody) / (the blame) lies with (some-
body), (control) belongs to (somebody), (re-
sponsibility) rests with (somebody).
Func2: (proposal) consists in (something),
(criticism) bears upon (something), (revenge)
falls upon (somebody).
Labor1-2: keep (something) under (control),
submit (something) to (analysis), meet (some-
body) with (applause), put (somebody) under
(arrest), hold (somebody) in (contempt),
bring (something) into (comparison with
something), take (something) into (considera-
tion).
An LF has no ontological correlate.
This is the case of Func0. This LF neither de-
notes a concept, nor attaches an argument to a
concept. It only duplicates the meaning of its
keyword and has no correlate in the SemS.
For example, in sentence (2) above the phrase
the match took place (= Func0) is only repre-
sented by the concept Match. Other exam-
ples of Func0: (the snow) falls, (the wind)
blows, (the danger) exists, (the war) is on,
(changes) occur.

For the purposes of semantic analysis, the
Russian dictionary and the ontology are
linked in the same way as dictionaries of dif-
ferent languages are linked in Machine Trans-
lation options of the ETAP-3 system. As
noted in Section 2, if the system performs
translations from language L to language L′,
all dictionary entries of L contain a special
zone (ZONE: L′) where all translation vari-
ants of the given word into L′ are recorded.
The semantic analysis option uses the ONTO
zone of the Russian dictionary. In this zone,
two types of information may be written:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.874806333333333">
• Default translation. This is a one-
word equivalent of the given word, which is
used if no translation rule is applicable.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.934815274509804">
For example, Russian komanda ‘team’ has
the Team class as its ontological counterpart.
This is written in the ontological zone of ko-
manda as follows:
ZONE: ONTO
TRANS: Team
Names of ontological individuals are also
often translated by default.
• Translation rules. A rule is written
every time one needs to carry out an action
which does not boil down to the default trans-
lation.
Let us give several examples of translation
rules written in the ONTO zone of the Rus-
sian lexicon. We will not give their formal
representation and restrict ourselves to ex-
plaining what they are doing in plain words.
Pobeditel’ ‘winner’ is a SportAgent (i.e. a
sportsman or a team) that won some contest:
SportAgent(?x)&amp;WinEvent(?y)&amp;
hasWinner(?y,?x).
Phrases of the type komanda NN ‘team of
NN’ (where NN is a proper human name in
the genitive case) are translated in four differ-
ent ways depending on the ontological infor-
mation assigned to NN.
(a) If NN is the name of a player, the
phrase is represented as ‘the team of which
NN is a player’: komanda Arshavina ‘Ar-
shavin’s team’ = Team(?team)
&amp;hasPart(?team,Arshavin).
(b) If NN is the name of a coach, the
phrase is represented as ‘the team of which
NN is the coach’: komanda Pellegrini ‘Pelle-
grini’s team’ = Team(?team)
&amp;hasCoach(?team,Pellegrini)
(c) If NN is the name of a captain, the
phrase is represented as ‘the team of which
NN is the captain’: komanda Iraneka ‘Ira-
nek’s team’ = Team(?team)&amp; hasCap-
tain(?team,Iranek)
(d) If NN is neither a player, nor a coach,
nor a captain, the phrase is represented as ‘the
team of which NN is a fan’: komanda Ivana
‘Ivan’s team’ = Team(?team)&amp; has-
Fan(?team,Ivan)
It is well-known that genitive noun phrases
(or phrases “N1 of N2” in English) are very
vague semantically, and their interpretation is
very much dependent on the context. This
example shows that even within the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995188">
74
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998729837209302">
part/whole interpretation such a phrase, para-
doxically, has two opposite varieties: either
N2 is part of N1, as in the team of Ar-
shavin/Arshavin’s team, or N1 is part of N2,
as in the leg of the table.
The following examples involve the prop-
erty hasLocation, which characterizes
both sport events (The match took place in
Madrid), and sport agents (the Ukrainian
sportsman, a London club).
Frequently, a football match is played in a
location, such that one of the teams is from
that location while the other is not. This situa-
tion can be represented by the following
SemS:
Match(?match)&amp;hasLocation(?mat
ch,?place)&amp;hasParticipant
(?match, ?team1)&amp;hasParicipant
(?match,?team2)&amp;differentFrom(
?team1,?team2)&amp;hasLocation(?te
am1,?place)&amp;¬hasLocation(?team
2,?place)
In the natural language this situation can be
viewed from different angles and denoted by
different words.
Xozjaeva ‘home team’ denotes a team that
plays a match in a place it is from, the adver-
sary being from a different place. Gosti ‘visi-
tors’ is a team that plays a match in a location
different from the place it is from, the adver-
sary being the home team. Prinimat’ ‘to re-
ceive’ means to play a match being a home
team, to host it. Igrat’ v gostjax lit.‘to play
being guests’ means to play a match away.
Although all these words correspond to the
same situation (14), their translation rules
cannot be identical. The rules should not only
introduce SemS (14), but also assure correct
amalgamation of this SemS with SemSs of
other words. In particular, the rule for prini-
mat’ ‘receive’ should guarantee that in (15)
Real Madrid instantiates variable ?team1 of
(14), and Barcelona – variable ?team2.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5770365">
(15) Real Madrid prinimal Barcelonu ‘Real
Madrid hosted Barcelona’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971220363636364">
The rule for gosti ‘visitors’ should see to it
that in (16) hasWinner property of
WinEvent be filled by variable ?team2 of
(14):
(16) Gosti vyigrali 3:1 ‘the visitors won 3 to
1’
This is assured due to marking ?team2 in
the gosti ‘visitors’ rule as the head element of
SemS (14). Naturally, in the xozjaeva ‘home
team’ rule the same role is assigned to
?team1.

7 Future work.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984666666667">
In the continuation, it is planned to enlarge
both the ontology and ONTO zone of the
Russian lexicon. We are investigating the
possibility of merging our small football on-
tology with some existing larger upper level
ontology. The difficult task will be to unify
our semantic rules with the axioms of this
ontology.
A second direction of our future activity is
connected with another component of the se-
mantic analyzer, which we did not touch
upon in this paper. It is the set of semantic
rules which are not incorporated into the lexi-
con due to their general character. This com-
ponent also requires significant enhancement.
An important extension of this work con-
sists in introducing an inference component
based on the SWRL rules.

The multifunctional ETAP-3 linguistic processor, developed by the Computational Linguistics Laboratory of the Institute for Information Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, (see e.g. Apresjan et al. 2003), is the product of decades of research and development in the field of language modelling. At the moment, ETAP-3 consists of a number of options, including 1) a rule-based machine translation system working both ways between Russian and English (plus several prototypes for other languages – French, German, Spanish, Korean and Arabic); 2) a system of synonymous and quasisynonymous paraphrasing of sentences; 3) an environment for deep annotation of text corpora, in which SynTagRus, the only corpus of Russian texts tagged morphologically, syntactically (in the dependency tree formalism), and lex</context>

In ontologically-oriented semantic analysis different LFs are reflected in different ways. An LF corresponds to an ontological class. Many LFs represent bundles of words that are semantically identical or very close and therefore can serve as representatives of this common meaning. We illustrate this with two closely related LFs (Apresjan et al. 2008). The meaning covered by LiquFunc0 is ‘to cause to cease to exist or to be taking place’.

A metamodel for linking conceptual knowledge with its lexicalizations in various languages is proposed in (Montiel-Ponsoda et al. 2007). The second direction research starts from NL texts and tries to interpret them in terms of the ontology. In most cases, this takes the form of marking the text with ontological classes and instances. A typical example is (Sanfilippo et al. 2006). One should also mention the work based on the Generalized Upper Model (GUM), which is meant for interfacing between domain models and NL components (Bateman et al. 1995) Our work belongs to this second direction, but our aim is not limited to finding ontological correlates to words. In many aspects we were inspired by the ontological semantic approach developed in the Mikrokosmos framework (cf. Nirenburg and Raskin 2004). We share many of its postulates and concrete solutions. In particular, semantic analysis of the text should be based on both linguistic and extra-linguistic knowledge. Linguistic knowledge is implemented in language grammars and dictionaries, while extralinguistic knowledge is comprised in an ontology, which enumerates concepts, describes th</context>

That is why some classes are more general than would be needed for football alone. For example, instead of having one class FootballPlayer, the ontology has a more general class Sportsman, of which FootballPlayer is a subclass. An equivalence restriction states that FootballPlayer is a Sportsman whose SportType is football. In this way, sportsmen doing different types of sports can be treated by the ontology in a uniform way. The football ontology is written in SWRL, which is OWL augmented with rules (Horrocks et al. 2004). In compiling it, we used some existing ontologies dealing with foot69 ball (http://www.lgi2p.ema.fr/~ranwezs/ontologie s/soccerV2.0.daml). As usual, properties of classes are inherited by the subclasses. For example, the Match class is a subclass of SportEvent, which in its turn is a subclass of Event. Match inherits from Event the properties of having definite Time and Place. From SportEvent it inherits the fact that its participants should be SportAgents. Its own properties are: the number of participants is 2 (as opposed to championships, which have more) and it has a definite sport type </context>
