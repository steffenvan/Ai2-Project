Japanese has many noun phrase patterns of the
type A no B consisting of two nouns A and B with an
adnominal particle no. As the semantic relations
between the two nouns in the noun phrase are not made
explicit, the interpretation of the phrases depends
mainly on the semantic characteristics of the nouns.
This paper describes the semantic diversity of A no B
and a method of semantic analysis for such phrases
based on feature unification.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999284641025641">
Japanese has many noun phrase patterns of the
type A no B. The noun phrase pattern, which consists
of two nouns A and B with an adnominal particle no,
and which has at least the same ambiguity as B of A
(and some additional ambiguities not found with the
equivalent English construction), does not express any
explicit semantic relations between the two nouns.
Consequently, its interpretation depends mainly on
the semantic characteristics of the nouns. Further-
more, phrase patterns N1 no N2 no ... no Nn often
appear. Because the number of possible dependencies
between the constituents is 21&apos;4 (2n-3)!! / n!, semantic
analysis of such phrases is necessary to resolve the
ambiguities. To date, there have been no adequate
analyses for this linguistic phenomenon, nor have
there been any clear methodological proposals for its
semantic analysis.
This paper describes a) the semantic diversity of A
no B, b) the analysis of the semantic structure for A no
B by a unification-based method of semantic function
application, c) typical semantic structures of A no B, d)
the possibility of paraphrasing A no B as a noun phrase
with a relative clause by the addition of a verb, and e)
the resolution of ambiguities using contextual informa-
tion from the viewpoint of relation between A no B and
its corresponding relative clause.
Although A no B is a simple form, it is interesting
in two respects. First, A no B represents a general
linguistic problem for semantic processing. The reason
is that, in some cases, A or B is a noun form derived
from a verb or adjective, thus necessitating the seman-
tic processing of verbs and adjectives. Second, A no B
can be paraphrased as a noun phrase with a relative
clause, in just the same way as some English complex
nominals 13&apos; 51. Putting it another way, as information
is condensed into a simple expression, there are
ambiguities as to the semantic relations between the
two nouns. Consequently, contextual analysis plays a
crucial part in the resolution of the ambiguities.

2. Semantic Diversity of A no B
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999498810810811">
A no B is frequently found in Japanese sentences.
An examination of scientific and newspaper articles
showed that the occurrence of A no B accounts for about
half the total number of noun phrases in a text The
other occurrences are noun phrases with relative
clauses, and coordinated noun phrases. In construc-
tions of the type A no B, A or B can represent either a
simple noun, as in Taroo no ie (&amp;quot;Taro&apos;s house&amp;quot;), NP of
the same A no B pattern, as in kariforunta no shuto no
jinko (&amp;quot;the population of the capital of California&amp;quot;), or
NP with a relative clause, as in Watashi ga atta hito no
na (&amp;quot;the name of the person who I met&amp;quot;). There is also a
fourth pattern involving an additional particle such as
kara, made, de and so on, as in Tookyoo kara no
densha (&amp;quot;the train from Tokyo&amp;quot;). This paper deals
mainly with constructions of the first type, though the
method presented here is also applicable recursively to
patterns of the second and third types: this is possible
because in such constructions, the semantic features of
A (i.e. X no Y, or SY) derive from its head (Y). In the
fourth type, analysis is slightly less straightforward,
because the particle does provide some additional
useful information.
A no modifies a head B to restrict or clarify the
reference&amp;quot;.21 of B. In the example Sutanfoodo daigaku
no kyooju. (&amp;quot;professor at Stanford University&amp;quot;), Satan-
foodo daigaku (&amp;quot;Stanford University&amp;quot;) restricts and
clarifies the range of reference for kyooju (&amp;quot;professor&amp;quot;).
Such A no B constructions can be classified seman-
tically into five main groups according to the character-
istics of A and B, as shown in Table 1. The five main
groups can be further classified into a total of about 80
semantic relations. In the study mentioned above&amp;quot;,
the authors examined about ten thousand examples of
A no B occurrences, and checked the semantic relations.
The appendix shows the semantic relations together
with examples. It is necessary to analyze these seman-

From a different viewpoint, this is a generalization of
the method of case frame analysis in which the analysis
of the semantic structure of a verb-plus-noun phrase is
based on the case-frame of the verb. That is, when a
verb as a functor is applied to a noun phrase as its
argument, if the noun phrase and a slot of the case-
frame unify, the semantic structure is obtained as a
result of assigning the relevant information from the
noun phrase to the slot. So, the analysis is a kind of
semantic treatment using the unification-based
method. In this view, the case frames correspond to
subcategorization frames, and the analysis corresponds
to unifications applied to a subcategorization frame 18. 91.
Characteristics of the function-based analysis are
mainly to express input-output relations clearly, and to
put stress on a lexical-based method.
As the meaning of A no B depends on the individual
A and B, it follows that each lexical entry must have
information regarding its &amp;quot;functionality&amp;quot;. This is also
the method adopted in CUG. Furthermore, these
functors, arguments, and resulting semantic structures
are represented as sets of attribute-value pairs, again
as in CUG. This is also similar to frame representa-
tions found in Al. The set of attribute-value pairs
associated with a functor noun and an argument noun
are generally represented as in Figure 1, and will be
called a &amp;quot;semantic structure&amp;quot;. The characteristics of
these structures are described in Section 3.3. In the
representation, the attributes left and right indicate
an argument for a functor word and a position (direc-
tion), and the values represent conditions imposed on
the argument. Syncat, semcat and sense indicate syn-
tactic, semantic and head word meaning respectively.
Marker indicates the case particle found as a post-posi-
tion with the noun phrase. Fred gives semantic condi-
tions which restrict and clarify the relation between A

tic relations in such detail in order to produce good
quality machine translation from Japanese into Eng-
lish among other tasks. To date, linguistic processing
has not entailed such a detailed classification.
The semantic structure of A no B is generally a
function of the meanings of A and B, but the processing
is not just a simple computation based on the semantic
contents of A and B. For instance, when B functions as
a predicate semantically, there is a case relation
between A and B. However, there are no syntactic
clues such as a case particle, unlike in full sentences.
Hence, it is necessary to consider the semantic
characteristics of A and B in order to analyze the
semantic structure.
Processing of context 1121 is generally necessary to
determine the correct semantic structure of A no B
uniquely, as A no B is often ambiguous if considered
out of context. For instance, in the case of Furansujin
no hanashi (&amp;quot;speech of a Frenchman&amp;quot;), there are two
possible semantic relations for Furansujin (&amp;quot;French-
man&amp;quot;): i.e. as agent or content of hanashi (&amp;quot;speech&amp;quot;).

3.2 Semantic Structure Analysis of A no B
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985071428571">
The noun phrase A no B is regarded as a composi-
tion of A no and B. Therefore, A no B is composed of A
no and B by the function role of either A no or B. Which
of A no or B has a function role depends on syntactic
and semantic characteristic as described in section 3.3.
Then A no is regarded as being constructed from A and
no. Accordingly, the semantic structure of A no B is
analyzed as follows: First, the functor no gets argu-
ment A, and makes a noun phrase A no with the
semantic characteristics inherited from A. Secondly,
the functor A no or B gets an argument B or A no
respectively and makes a noun phrase A no B with the
semantic characteristics inherited from B. The analy-
sis process is shown as follows.

In the case of A p no B (where p is an additional par-
ticle), A and p are combined first. The semantic struc-
ture of A p is almost the same as that of A no except for
the additional information derived from the marker p.
After this, the final semantic structure is composed in
the same way as for A no B. This paper focuses mainly
on the analysis process after constituents of A no B
have been found, and does not pay specific attention to
the method of how constituents are found, for which
purpose the active chart parsing method is used.
With regard to the composition of A no, we take the
choice giving no the functor role from the viewpoint of
generality, although it is possible to view A as having
this role. No has a functor role that shifts character-
istics and functions of A to the semantic structure of A
no, and adds a marker feature to the semantic structure
of A no. The representation of no is shown in Figure 2.
In the analysis of A no B, the semantic characteris-
tics and functions of A and B weigh heavily, because
although there is an adnominal case particle no, it is
semantically rather neutral compared with other case
particles. To put it another way, case particles usually
function as explicit indicators of the preferred semantic
interpretation. This fact suggests the significance of
studying the method of analysis of A no B.
When A no has a functor role, the functor must get B
as its argument and extract a semantic relation
between A and B. For example, in guruupu no shuukaz
(&amp;quot;meeting of a group&amp;quot;), guruupu no modifies an action
nominal and makes a result semantic structure
indicating the semantic relation (agent) as in Figure 3.
In the representation &gt; pred indicates a constraint
that an argument must have a pred feature.
The main semantic category of A no B is generally
taken from the head B of A no B. However, in some
cases the semantics of B are different from those of A no
B, and it is necessary to change the semantic cate-

3.3 Semantic Structures in Five Main Groups
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988344073170732">
The characteristics of the semantic structures in the
five main groups are as follows.
(Case 1) In this case, B, which is the nominal form of
a predicate (a verb or an adjective), functions as an
argument, and A, which is a semantic case argument
of B, functions as a functor. Notice that when B
functions semantically as a predicate, there are two
alternatives for the assignment of the functor role. The
first is that the predicate word functions as the functor.
The second is the reverse141. This paper adopts the
latter way mainly because of the characteristic of free
word order in a Japanese sentence.
The semantic structure of A and A no is almost the
same except for a marker feature, and has the following
functor role: when A no is an obligatory case (argu-
ment) of the predicate B, A no unifies with the
argument feature of B. When A no is an optional case
(adjunct), the semantic structure of A no is added to
that of B as an optional case by unification. The functor
role is added to A by a kind of lexical rule. Examples
are shown in Figures 3 and 4.
(Case 2 and Case 3] In these cases, B represents a
kind of case role or attribute respectively, which
functions as a predicate. So, functionality is given to A
in the same way as described above. Examples are
shown in Figures 5 and 6.
[Case 4] The reverse case of Case 1, that is, A is the
nominal form of a predicate, and B is the semantic case
element of the predicate. So B is a functor and A no is
its argument in the reverse way. The example is shown
in Figure 7. Kooen (&amp;quot;park&amp;quot;) in the example gets an
argument in the opposite direction to that of example 4.
The phrase in this case corresponds to a noun phrase
with a relative clause. So, a feature embedded is used
in the representation, that is, it means that the pred
feature is introduced from the complement.
(Case 5] Semantic relations in this case are classified
mainly into three types : a) relational restriction such
as a human relation, b) attributive restriction such as a
kind relation and c) situational restriction such as a
location relation.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.769829714285714">
(a) relational restriction: This case includes the rela-
tionships between humans, organizations, and whole-
part relations. Generally a predicate role is given to B
and a functor role is given to A in the same way as Case
1. An example is shown in Figure 8. In the example,
sensei (&amp;quot;teacher&amp;quot;) has a pred feature and is an argu-
ment of the functor watashi (&amp;quot;r).
(b) attributive restriction: A has attributive character-
istics such as quantity, kind, degree, and property, and
B is generally a thing. As A functions as a kind of pred-
icate, a predicate feature is assigned to A. An example
is shown in Figure 9 with kooshijima no nuno (&amp;quot;check-
ered-pattern cloth&amp;quot;), where kooshtjuma has a pred fea-
ture and is an argument of the functor nuno (&amp;quot;cloth&amp;quot;).
(c) situational restriction: A has situational meanings
such as location, time, source, destination, purpose, and
method, and restricts B by the situation. Like the
relational restriction case, B is assigned a predicate
feature, and A a functor role as shown in Figure 10. In
the example, doozoo (&amp;quot;bronze statue&amp;quot;) has a pred fea-
ture and is an argument of the functor kooen (&amp;quot;park&amp;quot;).

possibilities: ((Ano B) no C) as in, for example, jiyuu
no megami no shashin (&amp;quot;photograph of the Statue of
Liberty&amp;quot;), and (Ano (Bno C)) as Kariforunia-san no
jooshitsu no kome (&amp;quot;rice of fine qaulaity from
California&amp;quot;). Thus, the middle noun (B) may relate to
the words on either side (A and C), or to only the right-
hand word (C). In the first case, the middle noun may
be an argument of the predicate on both sides. In the
latter case, the rightmost word C may be an argument
of each predicate to the left, the number of which is not
in general restricted.
C) There are two cases of (A no (B no C)). When C is a
nominal predicate, A and B might be separate
arguments as in Kinoo no Taroo no Sanpo (&amp;quot;Taro&apos;s walk
of yesterday&amp;quot;). When C is an ordinary noun, however,
the analysis is further complicated by the fact that
implicit predicates such as location, possession,
attribution etc., are involved. For example, in
Tookyoo no NTT no biru (&amp;quot;NTT&apos;s building in Tokyo&amp;quot;),
the inner predicate structure for NTT no biru (&amp;quot;NTT
has a building&amp;quot;) is attached to the appropriate
argument of the outer predicate Tookyoo no biru
(&amp;quot;building is in Tokyo&amp;quot;).
From the characteristics described above and the
method for assigning a functor role to an argument of a
predicate, we adopt the method that a functor role is
added to a constituent by a kind of lexical rule before
function application. In general, several candidate
constituents are made by the feature structure pre-
formation. For example, at the stage of AnoB Ano B,
when B is a functor and has a meaning such as location,
time and so on, two solutions for B are offered as
candidates: one as an argument of Ano, which works
as a predicate, and the other as an adjunct.

the Sentence
4.1 Paraphrase of A no B as a Noun Phrase
with a Relative Clause
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999541264705882">
The expression A no B can be paraphrased into A p
V B or A&apos; B, adding an appropriate particle p and
verb / adjective V, or reforming A to a verbal form A&apos; if
appropriate. Both A p V and A&apos; are relative clauses.
The paraphrased expression is more informative and
some of the ambiguity is resolved. Paraphrases of A no
B in Case 1 - Case 4 are rather easy, as added
verbs / adjectives do not depend so much on context as
compared with Case 5. Noun phrases with a relative
clause for each case in the A no B classification are
shown in Table 2.
Such paraphrases are obtained by a change from a
verb-centered to a noun-centered view. A no B is gener-
ally related to some event or state in a discourse, and
the event or state is represented by an appropriate
predicate: pred(A, B). By taking a noun-centered view,
the representation is transferred into a representation
A [pred(A(.), B)], that is, A in pred(A, B).
The expression that gives the corresponding predi-
cate is taken from the value of the pred attribute in the
semantic structure. A noun phrase paraphrased with a
relative clause is generally constructed as follows: 1)
the head B is put first, 2) a verb is chosen based on the
rel attribute, and put to the left of B, 3) a noun phrase
corresponding to the appropriate case role as given by
the argument structure of the predicate, is constructed
from A and the particle indicated by a default-marker,
and put to the left of the verb. For instance, in zoo no
omosa (&amp;quot;weight of an elephant&amp;quot;), first, the head omosa
is taken; second, verb rnotsu (&amp;quot;have&amp;quot;) is taken from a
value of rel, and put to the left of omosa; third, the
agent zoo ga (&amp;quot;elephant&amp;quot;) is put to the left of omosa. In
this way, the desired complex noun phrase zoo ga motsu
omosa (&amp;quot;weight that an elephant has&amp;quot;) is arrived at.

between a predicate structure in A no B semantic
structure and the related event structure in the
discourse. A sequence of related events is described in
a discourse. On the other hand, the semantic structure
is represented by an appropriate predicate feature.
From these, the correct structure can be obtained by
unifying an event semantic structure with a predicate
feature in A no B as follows.
event-semantic-structure-in-context
= pred-structure-in-semantic-structure-of-A no B
Here, &amp;quot;=&amp;quot; means that the left hand side unifies
with the right hand side.
Ambiguities of A no B may result from amibiguities
regarding the predicates that could be added,
ambiguities in the words themselves, or ambiguous
case relations. The disambiguation process is
illustrated below using an example in which the added
predicates are ambiguous. Generally, a verb-centered
semantic structure is extracted from a sentence. For
the sentence,
(sl) Hanako wa kyonen e o kaita.
(&amp;quot;Hanako painted a picture last year.&amp;quot;)
the following semantic structure is obtained. This
representation is simplified, showing only the
information needed for the explanation.
pred: [rel: paint agent: Hanako object: picture]
This semantic structure can be obtained also from the
noun-centered semantic structure as follows.
picture
[pred: rel: paint agent: Hanako object: picture(&amp;quot;)]
Next, let us assume that the sentence (s2) occurs in the
context of (sl).
(s2) Hanako no e wa tenrankai de yuushoo shita.
(&amp;quot;The picture of Hanako/Hanako&apos;s picture
won the first prize in an exhibition.&amp;quot;)
Hanako no e (&amp;quot;the picture of Hanako&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Hanako&apos;s
picture&amp;quot;) is ambiguous when taken out of context, with
a range of possible semantic relations including
possession, purchase, producer, and content.
However, the ambiguity is resolved by unifying the
semantic structure of the previous sentence with each
of the semantic structures representing the possible
semantic relations: the only semantic structure which
can be successfully unified has the producer relation.

5. Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.938230105263158">
This research concerns semantic structures,
especially those of noun phrases, and was conducted as
part of a series of research efforts in the LUTE
(Language Understander, Translator, &amp; Editor) project
16,7.1°, &amp;quot;1. To date, ten thousand examples of A no B
have been collected from scientific and newspaper
articles, and the appropriateness of the classification of
A no B investigated. In addition, as a preliminary
experiment, a semantic relation analysis was tried
with about a thousand examples, with rather
satisfactory results. The meaning of A no B is
generally ambiguous, and contextual information is
needed to resolve the ambiguities. There seems to be
variety of such ambiguities relating to contextual
information, but in principle such ambiguities are
considered to be resolved by assuming appropriate
predicates as described in this paper.
