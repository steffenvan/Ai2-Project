Schwa deletion is an important issue in
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion for Indo-
Aryan languages (IAL). In this paper, we
describe a syllable minimization based
algorithm for dealing with this that
outperforms the existing methods in terms of
efficiency and accuracy. The algorithm is
motivated by the fact that deletion of schwa is
a diachronic and sociolinguistic phenomenon
that facilitates faster communication through
syllable economy. The contribution of the
paper is not just a better algorithm for schwa
deletion; rather we describe here a constrained
optimization based framework that can partly
model the evolution of languages, and hence,
can be used for solving many problems in
computational linguistics that call for
diachronic explanations.

<bodyText confidence="0.99998476923077">
Linguists propose new models for languages
in order to explain language acquisition and
processing by humans. Irregularities and
exceptions to the theories are often explained by
evidence from diachronic linguistics and other
social and external phenomena. Absence of
diachronic analysis in computational modelling of
languages results in a large number of exceptions,
which are commonly handled by ad hoc rules or
exhaustive enumeration. These techniques lead to
poor scalability and lack of graceful degradation of
the systems along with increased complexity.
Although complete modelling of the evolution of
language is impossible due to the involvement of
myriads of socio-political and cultural factors, it is
definitely possible to model certain basic
principles of language change.
In this paper we describe an algorithm for
schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan Languages (IAL)
that is motivated by the diachronic evolution of the
languages. The proposed computational framework
models languages as a constrained optimization
system, where a language evolves by optimizing
the rate of communication, subjected to a set of
constraints such as ease of articulation and
learning, and acoustic distinctiveness. A syllable
minimization based optimization function fitted to
the aforementioned model has been used for
solving the problem of schwa deletion with
considerable success.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2
defines the problem and discusses some of the
previous works. Section 3 describes the current
models of language evolution, which has been
used to develop a computational framework
described in the next section. Section 5 and 6
presents the algorithm and its experimental
analysis respectively. Section 7 concludes the
paper summarizing our contributions.

2 The Problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997995454545455">
Schwa is defined as the mid-central vowel that
occurs in unstressed syllables. The first vowel of
the IAL alphabet {a}1 is the schwa. Normally, it is
pronounced as /ə/ in Hindi and Sanskrit, and as /ɔ/
in Bengali. Schwa deletion is a phonological
phenomenon where schwa is absent in the
pronunciation of a particular word, although
ideally it should have been pronounced (Ohala,
1983).
Sanskrit and some of the modern IAL that have
evolved from it (e.g. Hindi and Bengali), are
written from left to right using Brahmi-derived
scripts. All the vowels are explicitly represented
using diacritical or non-diacritical marks around
the consonant except for the schwa, which is the
inherent vowel. Unlike Sanskrit, many modern
IAL like Hindi and Bengali allow deletion of
schwa in certain contexts. Table I illustrates this
phenomenon for the three languages. In order to
determine the proper pronunciation of the words, it
is necessary to predict which schwas are deleted
and which are not. Thus, schwa deletion is an

in three different IAL. The number of syllables is

pronunciations. In Bengali {a} can also be
pronounced as /o/ in certain contexts.
Several theories have been proposed on the
linguistic aspects of schwa deletion in Hindi (Pray,
1970; Kaira 1976; Ohala, 1977, 1983) and its
diachronic evolution (Misra, 1967). Ohala (1983)
has summarized the rule for schwa deletion in
Hindi as
ə —+ O / VC __ CV
Condition 1: There may be no morpheme
boundary in the environment to the left.
Condition 2: The output of the rule should not
violate the phonotactic constraints of Hindi
Convention: The rule applies from right to left
The explanation of the rule was based on
psycholinguistic evidence; diachronic facts were
used only to explain the exceptions. Narsimhan et
al (2001) designed an algorithm for schwa deletion
in Hindi based on this work. The reported accuracy
of the algorithm is 89%. Some rules for word final
schwa deletion in Bengali have been proposed by
Chatterji (1926), but we do not know of any work
on computational modelling.

3 Factors governing language change
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999644166666667">
The fact that schwa deletion in IAL is a diachronic
phenomenon has been substantiated by Misra
(1967). According to Ohala (1983) the deletion of
schwas is more frequent in casual and fast speech
compared to formal and slower ones. It can be
inferred from these facts that the motivation behind
schwa deletion is faster communication through
minimization of syllables (Tranel 1999).
Some recent works on mathematical and
simulation based modelling of language evolution
(Boer, 2000; Cangelosi and Parisi, 2002; Nowak et
al, 2002) suggests that several features of
languages emerge due to some basic cognitive and
articulatory factors. These models assume a) ease
of articulation, b) ease of learning, and c) acoustic
distinctiveness as the primary driving forces
behind language evolution. The three forces
operate simultaneously over the language in order
to maximize the rate of successful communication
in terms of time and effort spent by the language
users to generate, understand and learn the
language. Thus, language can be modelled as a
multi-objective optimization system, where the
optimization criteria are
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.970248142857143">
• Minimization of effort (in terms of energy and
time spent while conveying a piece of
information)
• Minimization of learning time and effort
• Minimization of probability of
misunderstanding (in the sense of confusing
one word with another)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999559944444445">
These three criteria are mutually contradictory and
therefore there exists no global optimum. Let us
examine the phenomenon of schwa deletion under
this multi-objective optimization model for
language evolution. When a vowel is deleted from
a word the number of syllables reduces by one. For
example, in Table 1, for the second word, Sanskrit
and Bengali have three syllables, whereas due to
the deletion of a schwa, the Hindi pronunciation
has only two syllables. Reduction of syllables
implies shorter time for pronunciation of a word,
and hence faster communication. However,
deletion of schwas in certain contexts might result
in a consonant cluster which the native speakers
find very difficult or impossible to pronounce. This
beats the very purpose of schwa deletion, i.e. the
minimization of effort of articulation and therefore,
is unacceptable. The second condition for the rule
proposed by Ohala (section 2) refers to this
constraint.
There are contexts where deletion of schwa
would not give rise to inadmissible consonant
clusters. For example, in the Hindi/Bengali word
pari (fairy, /pəri/ in Hindi), if the first schwa is
deleted, the pronunciation would be /pri/, which
does not violate the phonotactic constraints of the
languages. The schwa, however, is not deleted,
because /pəri/ and /pri/ are too distinct from each
other to be interpreted as the same word.
Moreover, /pri/ is closer to other Hindi words like
priya (favorite, /prijə/). In this case, the deletion of
schwa reduces the acoustic distinctiveness of the
word from other words in the lexicon, which
increases the probability of misunderstanding, and
hence the schwa might not be deleted in such a
context.

4 Computational framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999529032258">
We propose the following diachronic
explanation for schwa deletion in IAL.
In old IAL none of the schwas are deleted. The
modern IAL use the script and spelling
conventions similar to Sanskrit. Due to a higher
evolutionary pressure on the spoken forms of the
languages than on the written forms, schwas are
deleted in the pronunciation, but are still present in
the graphemic forms. The deletion is a slow
diachronic phenomenon, where in order to
communicate faster, initially the speakers
unintentionally deleted the schwas. Only those
deletions were acceptable that did not lead to a
syllable structure which was too difficult to
pronounce, learn or understand for the native
speakers. Gradually, the pattern of deletion spread
across the population and over the different items
in the lexicon.
In this section, we describe a computational
framework for modelling the aforementioned
hypothesis based on the three optimization criteria
stated in the last section. The aim of the proposed
framework is not to validate the hypothesis
through micro-simulation (Cangelosi and Parisi,
2002); rather it tries to predict the schwa deletion
pattern based on the optimizations that might have
affected the deletion of schwas diachronically. In
the next section, we present an efficient algorithm
for schwa deletion in IAL, which can be
automatically constructed from this model, without
the help of any other evidence.

4.2 Phonotactic constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9527015">
In order to model the ease of articulation, we
start with the modelling of phonotactic constraints.
A consonant cluster is a string of the form CpCp+.
Phonotactic constraints restrict the presence of
some of the consonant clusters in the phonetic
representation of a word (wp). At the most generic
level we can think of a consonant cluster ranking
(CCR) function, where ℕ is the set of natural
numbers
CCR: Cp+ → ℕ
The function CCR is independent of any
language and every language has a threshold rCCR,
such that a consonant cluster x E Cp+ is allowed in
the language if and only if

<equation confidence="0.825998">
CCR (x) &lt;_ rCCR

<bodyText confidence="0.998130666666667">
We define two special variants of CCR, O_CCR
and C_CCR, which ranks the admissibility of the
consonant clusters at the onset and coda positions
respectively. The definition is similar to that of
CCR, and rOCCR and rCCCR are the corresponding
threshold values.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.6561225">
3 This assumption is not strictly valid since a cluster of consonant might be
mapped to a single consonant or a different cluster.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.980076">
The sonority hierarchy (Vennemann, 1988) and
markedness conditions (Kager, 1999) along with
the physiology of the articulatory mechanism point
towards the existence of a language independent
ranking function as hypothesized above. However,
there might be accidental gaps in the list of
admissible consonant clusters of a language
(Ohala, 1983), which can not be explained on the
basis of CCR alone. Therefore, we define a
Boolean function ADM that tell us about the
admissibility of consonant clusters in a language.
ADM: Cp+ → {0, 1}, such that for s E Cp+
(ADM (s) = 1) p (s is an admissible cluster)

CCR as

CCR.

<bodyText confidence="0.999794259259259">
This means that if either the coda or the onset of
a syllable is inadmissible, then the ranking
function maps the syllable to the highest possible
rank, represented symbolically by the infinity (oo).
onset and coda are projection functions that project
the longest valid prefix and suffix of a syllable
respectively that are elements of Cp*.
We define a syllabification to be valid if all the
syllables are valid (i.e. strings of the form
Cp*VpCp*) and every symbol in the word is a part
of one and only one syllable in the syllabification.
We can define a partial ordering, &lt;_6, among the
possible valid syllabifications of a given word
based on SRp such that the syllabification with
smaller number of high ranked syllables is
preferred to one that has more hard (high ranked)
syllables. Now we define SYL (wp) as the set of all
possible syllabifications 6162...6. such that (i)
6162...6. is a valid syllabification of wp and (ii)
there exist no other valid syllabification v of wp
such that v &lt;_6 6162...6..
The definitions of syllable and syllabification are
motivated by the markedness conditions (Kager,
1999) and experimental results on child language
acquisition (MacNeilage and Davis, 2000), that
show that some syllables and syllabifications are
easier to learn and pronounce than others.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99805">
4.4 Acoustic distinctiveness constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98625935483871">
Perceptual experiments show that speakers
always articulate the onset of the syllables more
clearly and correctly compared to the articulations
of the vowel and the coda (Fosler-Lussier et al,
1999; Greenberg, 1999). Therefore, it is likely that
the hearer distinguish between syllables by paying
more weight to the onset than to the coda. A
continuous distance metric D6 might be defined
based on these experimental results, such that the
probability of confusion (interpreting one syllable
as another) between two syllables 6 and 6’
increases as the value of D6(6 , 6’) decreases. We
can further define an acoustic distance function Dw
using the function D6 , which measures the
probability of confusion between two arbitrary
words in the phonetic domain.
In the case of schwa deletion, however, we want
the acoustic distance between the ideal
pronunciation (without any schwa deletion) and
the normal pronunciation (with schwa deletion) to
be smaller, so that the word is not confused with
other words in the lexicon. Formally, for the
graphemic representation of a word wg = x1x2 ...
xn,
Dw(fg2p (x1).fg2p (x2)... fg2p (xn), Fg2p(wg)) &lt;
τcritical, where τcritical is the maximum allowable
distance and ‘.’ is the concatenation operator.
Rather than modelling this as an optimization
criterion, we reformulate this as a constraint. The
simplification in this case serves our purpose.
We define, where x E Cp
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9554225">
D6(x. fg2p(α), φ) = 0 (4a)
D6(6, 6.x) = 0 (4b)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99310980952381">
For all other cases D6 is infinity (oo), unless the
two syllables are identical. (4c)
(4a) allows the deletion of a schwa from an open
syllable; (4b) allows the concatenation of a
consonant at the coda position. This is motivated
by the fact that coda has least distinctiveness
(Greenberg, 1999). (4c) restricts any change at the
onset of a syllable or the vowels other than schwa.
On the basis of D6 we can define Dw(wp1, wp2) =
0 if and only if there exists an alignment between
the sequences SYL (wp1) and SYL (wp2), with
possible gaps (φ or null syllables) such that for all
the corresponding pairs of syllable taken from the
two sequences, the acoustic distinctiveness (D6)
between them is 0. Thus, only operations allowed
are deletion of a schwa and addition of a consonant
at the coda position. Anything else is forbidden for
the sake of acoustic distinctiveness.

the salient features of the model by comparing it
with the optimization criteria stated in section 3.

for the sake of simplicity. Figure 2 describes an
algorithm for schwa deletion using the rules above.
It is easy to see that the time complexity of the
algorithm is O(|wg|). Due to limited space, we omit
the proof that the algorithm for Fg2p indeed
minimizes the number of syllables without
violating the constraints specified by ADM and Dw.
However, there might be more than one (precisely
2) possible solutions and in that case the algorithm
chooses one of the solutions on the basis of the
direction of traversal at step 4. The right to left
traversal gives better results (as has been
confirmed by Ohala, 1983) because the duration of
syllables reduces towards the end of the word and
hence the tendency to delete schwas at the word
final position increases.

The algorithm was implemented for Bengali and
Hindi and tested on a set of words. Table 2
summarizes the results for Hindi (tested on the
words in a pocket dictionary (Hindi-Bangla-
English, 2001)). The algorithm for Bengali was
tested on 1000 randomly selected words from a
corpus and found to be around 85% accurate.
Some of the important features of the algorithm
are as follows.

carried across morpheme boundaries.
Morphological analyzer for Hindi and Bengali
were implemented and integrated with the
algorithm. For Hindi, the results were nearly
perfect (99.89%)
Exceptions: For Hindi there was hardly any
exception to the algorithm. For Bengali, the types
of words that were incorrectly processed by the
algorithm include a class of very frequently used,
disyllabic modifier adjectives, certain suffixes,
borrowed words from Sanskrit and compound
words. In Bengali, the schwa which is retained (as
opposed to the predictions by the algorithm) are
pronounced as /o/ and not as / ɔ/. Since, /o/ is not a
central vowel, deletion of /o/ is marked as
compared to deletion of / ɔ/ which is unmarked.
Transformation of schwa to some non-neutral
vowel in Hindi is unknown and therefore, the
algorithm works perfectly for Hindi.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992382978724">
In this paper, we have described the
phenomenon of schwa deletion in the IAL and
proposed a diachronic explanation for it. In order
to model the diachronic evolution, we used the
concepts of ease of articulation, ease of learning
and acoustic distinctiveness. We developed a
computational framework, where we reformulated
some of the optimization criteria as constraints and
one of them (the syllable minimization) as the
basic optimization function. The outcome of this is
an efficient and accurate algorithm for solving
schwa deletion in IAL.
The contribution of this paper is not just a
better algorithm for schwa deletion, which is
necessary for developing Text-to-speech
synthesizers for IAL, but a new approach based on
a constrained optimization framework, motivated
by the diachronic evolution of languages. A closer
look at the algorithm will reveal that it is not much
different from the schwa deletion rule proposed by
Ohala (1983). However, Ohala’s rule was based on
psycholinguistic and empirical observations,
whereas we have derived the rule from a set of
very basic assumptions (minimization of syllables
and certain constraints). The algorithm itself can
provide an explanation for the phenomenon.
It must be mentioned that neither the aim nor
the findings of this work are meant to propose a
new model of language change. The models and
concepts used here were all present previously and
we have assumed and included some of them
directly in our model. Our finding is not a proof of
those models and can be considered only as a
further validation. Our only claim here is that
diachronic clues can help solve important
problems in computational linguistics and for this
we provide a computational framework and a
specific example.
Some of the questions that we would like to
address in the future include modelling of optional
schwa deletion in Bengali compound words,
evolution of morpho-phonology for Bengali verb
systems, and modelling of dialect diversity using
diachronic clues. More realistic, yet manageable
computational frameworks for holistic or detailed
modelling of language evolution can also be an
interesting area of future research.

In this paper, we describe a syllable minimization based algorithm for dealing with this that outperforms the existing methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that deletion of schwa is a diachronic and sociolinguistic phenomenon that facilitates faster communication through syllable economy. The contribution of the paper is not just a better algorithm for schwa rather we describe here a framework that can partly model the evolution of languages, and hence, can be used for solving many problems in computational linguistics that call for diachronic explanations.</abstract>

According to Ohala (1983) the deletion of schwas is more frequent in casual and fast speech compared to formal and slower ones. It can be inferred from these facts that the motivation behind schwa deletion is faster communication through minimization of syllables (Tranel 1999). Some recent works on mathematical and simulation based modelling of language evolution (Boer, 2000; Cangelosi and Parisi, 2002; Nowak et al, 2002) suggests that several features of languages emerge due to some basic cognitive and articulatory factors. These models assume a) ease of articulation, b) ease of learning, and c) acoustic distinctiveness as the primary driving forces behind language evolution. The three forces operate simultaneously over the language in order to maximize the rate of successful communication in terms of time and effort spent by the language users to generate, understand and learn the language. Thus, language can be modelled as a multi-objective optimization system, where the optimization cri</context>

Only those deletions were acceptable that did not lead to a syllable structure which was too difficult to pronounce, learn or understand for the native speakers. Gradually, the pattern of deletion spread across the population and over the different items in the lexicon. In this section, we describe a computational framework for modelling the aforementioned hypothesis based on the three optimization criteria stated in the last section. The aim of the proposed framework is not to validate the hypothesis through micro-simulation (Cangelosi and Parisi, 2002); rather it tries to predict the schwa deletion pattern based on the optimizations that might have affected the deletion of schwas diachronically. In the next section, we present an efficient algorithm for schwa deletion in IAL, which can be automatically constructed from this model, without the help of any other evidence. 4.1 Basic definitions All the unexplained symbols used below stand for their usual meaning in the context of formal language theory.

(4c) (4a) allows the deletion of a schwa from an open syllable; (4b) allows the concatenation of a consonant at the coda position. This is motivated by the fact that coda has least distinctiveness (Greenberg, 1999). (4c) restricts any change at the onset of a syllable or the vowels other than schwa. On the basis of D6 we can define Dw(wp1, wp2) = 0 if and only if there exists an alignment between the sequences SYL (wp1) and SYL (wp2), with possible gaps (φ or null syllables) such that for all the corresponding pairs of syllable taken from the two sequences, the acoustic distinctiveness (D6) between them is 0.

The definition is similar to that of CCR, and rOCCR and rCCCR are the corresponding threshold values. 3 This assumption is not strictly valid since a cluster of consonant might be mapped to a single consonant or a different cluster. The sonority hierarchy (Vennemann, 1988) and markedness conditions (Kager, 1999) along with the physiology of the articulatory mechanism point towards the existence of a language independent ranking function as hypothesized above. However, there might be accidental gaps in the list of admissible consonant clusters of a language (Ohala, 1983), which can not be explained on the basis of CCR alone. Therefore, we define a Boolean function ADM that tell us about the admissibility of consonant clusters in a language.

Section 5 and 6 presents the algorithm and its experimental analysis respectively. Section 7 concludes the paper summarizing our contributions. 2 The Problem Schwa is defined as the mid-central vowel that occurs in unstressed syllables. The first vowel of the IAL alphabet {a}1 is the schwa. Normally, it is pronounced as /ə/ in Hindi and Sanskrit, and as /ɔ/ in Bengali. Schwa deletion is a phonological phenomenon where schwa is absent in the pronunciation of a particular word, although ideally it should have been pronounced (Ohala, 1983). Sanskrit and some of the modern IAL that have evolved from it (e.g. Hindi and Bengali), are written from left to right using Brahmi-derived scripts. All the vowels are explicitly represented using diacritical or non-diacritical marks around the consonant except for the schwa, which is the inherent vowel. Unlike Sanskrit, many modern IAL like Hindi and Bengali allow deletion of schwa in certain contexts. Table I illustrates this phenomenon for the three languages. In order to determine the proper pronunciation of the words, it is necessary to predict which schwas are deleted and which are not</context>

The definition is similar to that of CCR, and rOCCR and rCCCR are the corresponding threshold values. 3 This assumption is not strictly valid since a cluster of consonant might be mapped to a single consonant or a different cluster. The sonority hierarchy (Vennemann, 1988) and markedness conditions (Kager, 1999) along with the physiology of the articulatory mechanism point towards the existence of a language independent ranking function as hypothesized above. However, there might be accidental gaps in the list of admissible consonant clusters of a language (Ohala, 1983), which can not be explained on the basis of CCR alone. Therefore, we define a Boolean function ADM that tell us about the admissibility of consonant clusters in a language. ADM: Cp+ → {0, 1}, such that for s E Cp+ (ADM (s) = 1) p (s is an admissible cluster) In general, we can derive this function from CCR as ADM (s) = sign (τCCR – CCR (s)) However, we might have to forcefully convert some values to 0 due to accidental gaps. 4.3 Syllable and Syllabification We define a syllable 6 as a regular expression, with the assumption that the nucleus contains a single vowel. Thus, 6 E Cp* Vp Cp* The sy</context>

It is easy to see that the time complexity of the algorithm is O(|wg|). Due to limited space, we omit the proof that the algorithm for Fg2p indeed minimizes the number of syllables without violating the constraints specified by ADM and Dw. However, there might be more than one (precisely 2) possible solutions and in that case the algorithm chooses one of the solutions on the basis of the direction of traversal at step 4. The right to left traversal gives better results (as has been confirmed by Ohala, 1983) because the duration of syllables reduces towards the end of the word and hence the tendency to delete schwas at the word final position increases. 6 Experimental Results and Discussions The algorithm was implemented for Bengali and Hindi and tested on a set of words. Table 2 summarizes the results for Hindi (tested on the words in a pocket dictionary (Hindi-BanglaEnglish, 2001)). The algorithm for Bengali was tested on 1000 randomly selected words from a corpus and found to be around 85% accurate. Some of the important features of the algorithm are as follows. • Efficiency: The algorithm run</context>
<context position="26048" citStr="Ohala (1983)" startWordPosition="4302" endWordPosition="4303">the optimization criteria as constraints and one of them (the syllable minimization) as the basic optimization function. The outcome of this is an efficient and accurate algorithm for solving schwa deletion in IAL. The contribution of this paper is not just a better algorithm for schwa deletion, which is necessary for developing Text-to-speech synthesizers for IAL, but a new approach based on a constrained optimization framework, motivated by the diachronic evolution of languages. A closer look at the algorithm will reveal that it is not much different from the schwa deletion rule proposed by Ohala (1983). However, Ohala’s rule was based on psycholinguistic and empirical observations, whereas we have derived the rule from a set of very basic assumptions (minimization of syllables and certain constraints). The algorithm itself can provide an explanation for the phenomenon. It must be mentioned that neither the aim nor the findings of this work are meant to propose a new model of language change. The models and concepts used here were all present previously and we have assumed and included some of them directly in our model. Our finding is not a proof of those models and can be considered only a</context>

Some rules for word final schwa deletion in Bengali have been proposed by Chatterji (1926), but we do not know of any work on computational modelling. 3 Factors governing language change The fact that schwa deletion in IAL is a diachronic phenomenon has been substantiated by Misra (1967). According to Ohala (1983) the deletion of schwas is more frequent in casual and fast speech compared to formal and slower ones. It can be inferred from these facts that the motivation behind schwa deletion is faster communication through minimization of syllables (Tranel 1999). Some recent works on mathematical and simulation based modelling of language evolution (Boer, 2000; Cangelosi and Parisi, 2002; Nowak et al, 2002) suggests that several features of languages emerge due to some basic cognitive and articulatory factors. These models assume a) ease of articulation, b) ease of learning, and c) acoustic distinctiveness as the primary driving forces behind language evolution. The three forces operate simultaneously over the language in order to maximize the rate of successful communication in terms of time and effort spent by the language users to generate, unders</context>
