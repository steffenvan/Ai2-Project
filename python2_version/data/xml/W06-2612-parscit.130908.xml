Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99984385">
Names are important in many societies,
even in technologically oriented ones
which use ID systems or other ways to
identify individual people. Names such
as personal surnames are the most im-
portant as they are used in many proc-
esses, such as identifying of people, re-
cord linkage and for genealogical re-
search as well. For Thai names this
situation is a bit different in that in Thai
the first names are most important.
Even phone books and directories are
sorted according to the first names.
Here we present a system for construct-
ing Thai names from basic syllables.
Typically Thai names convey a mean-
ing. For this we use an ontology of
names to capture the meaning of the
variants which are based on the Thai
naming methodology and rules.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999736638888889">
Names are used for identifying persons, places,
things and even ideas or concepts. Names serve
for labelling of categories or classes and for indi-
vidual items. They are properties of individuals
which are of greater importance in most commu-
nities. In technological oriented societies such as
modern Western the reference between names as
a label and the person is not as obvious as in
small tribal societies. This is especially true
where names are stored within large information
systems. This includes government, medical,
educational and even commercial records which
are kept about individuals. Names are the most
important referrer to a person even if there are
numbering systems like ID numbers because
such systems are not universal. Names are often
queried in a different way than they were en-
tered. Names represent complex lexical struc-
tures which have to be handled systematically for
data entry, storage and retrieval in order to get
sufficient recall or precision the retrieval process
in.
In this paper we present a first account of our
findings on constructing Thai names with the
help of an ontology of names as well as a work-
ing methodology for the naming process in Thai
culture.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2
contains a description of names and their ele-
ments. In Section 3 we outline the concept of
ontology of names. In Section 4 we present the
construction process and system for Thai names.
We apply this system together with an ontology
to construct names with an appropriate meaning.
Section 5 shows the conclusions of our study and
further work which has to be performed.

2 What is a Name?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995754545454546">
Names for individuals are often called proper
names, for humans sometimes also an-
throponyms. Names for places are called
toponyms, for bodies of water hydronyms, for
ethnic groups ethnonyms, for metaphors meto-
nyms and so on. Names are more than just
strings of characters. Names show important in-
formation such as titles, gender, marital status,
and even birthplace. For this names provide dif-
ferent elements (Section 2.2), which may differ
between cultures.

2.1 Naming for Identity and Security
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994330952381">
From the technical point of view we want to link
and match as many names as possible with the
correct individuals. If we deal with individuals of
the same name, e.g. John Smith, we have to es-
tablish a second identifier at least. This can be –
and is in many cases – a temporal element, like
the date of birth, which is an individual and un-
changing property of the person. Another way to
circumvent the problem is to establish numbering
systems, like ID numbers. Systems of numbers
or other ciphers can be generated within individ-
ual organisations. It is not likely that the result-
ing ID numbers will be the same in different or-
ganisations. The numbering may have limitations
as well, e.g. the individual health care setting
(e.g. within a hospital or district) or, in principle,
more widely (e.g. the National Health Service
number). In the past, the National Health Service
number in England and Wales had serious limita-
tions as a matching variable, and it was not
widely used on health-care records. With the al-
location of the new ten-digit number throughout
the NHS all this has been changed (Gill, 1997).
Although numbering systems are simple to
implement they can lead to different errors in
recording, transcripting, and keying. So we have
to take into account methods which reduce these
errors and facilitate good quality of data entry
and retrieval. One such method uses a checking
device such as check-digits (Wild, 1968, Ham-
ming, 1986). When we are not able to use unique
numbers or ciphers, natural matching variables
are the person&apos;s name, date of birth, sex and per-
haps other supplementary variables such as the
address with postal code and place of birth,
which are used in combination for matching. Re-
cently, it has been suggested that this simple
code could be extended for security critical
places (e.g. airports, checkpoints etc.) with bio-
metric marker information extracted from person
identifier information e.g. finger-
prints/iridograms.

3 Ontology of Names?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924066666667">
The term ontology has been widely used in re-
cent years in the field of Artificial Intelligence,
computer and information science especially in
domains such as, cooperative information sys-
tems, intelligent information integration, infor-
mation retrieval and extraction, knowledge rep-
resentation, and database management systems
(Guarino, 1998, Andrade and Saltz, 1999, 2000).
Many different definitions of the term are pro-
posed. One of the most widely quoted and well-
known definition of ontology is Gruber&apos;s (Gru-
ber, 1993): An ontology is an explicit specifica-
tion of a conceptualization.
The term is borrowed from philosophy, where
an ontology is a systematic account of existence.
Here in this paper we adopt the following defini-
tion: Ontology is the study or concern about what
kinds of things exist - what entities or things are
there in the universe (Blackburn, 1996). Our
work on ontologies will comprise: a terminologi-
cal component where we lay down the concepts
and an assertional component (or Knowledge
Base) which contains the individual instances
(entities). The level of description will be tax-
onomies with hierarchically related terms and
controlled vocabularies (thesaurus) with the help
of semantic networks.
An ontology of names can be worked out in
many different forms, but every ontology will
include a dictionary, some definition of the terms

(semantics), and indications how they depend on
each other, e.g. in hierarchies and semantic net-
works. For example, an ontology of names can
be defined as what kinds of names exist, e.g. first
name, surname, nickname, etc (Section 2.2). This
typically comprises definitions of different
names, the elements of names and their struc-
tures. In this section we show how an ontology
of names can be captured and defined.
An ontology can also be used to establish the
network of synonyms, e.g. using spelling norms
to determine whether two names are the
same/similar or not. For example, two names:
Totie and Totiey can be defined based on as-
sumption that they are the same as Totty. This
attempts to tackle the seemingly irreducible con-
ventions of surname. In compositional semantics
let us consider the name “Gutensohn”. This name
will be used to illustrate the various semantic
considerations in German naming. The name is a
composition of the two strings Godith and Sohn,
which have unambiguous, meaningful interpreta-
tions. The interpretation of Godith is god or good
battle and Sohn is interpreted as a male child in
relation to his parent. The composition Gutsohn,
Gudzon, or in other cultures: Guditson, Godye-
son and Godithson and Godison (Reaney and
Wilson 1997).
We incorporate the different elements of per-
sonal names (Figure 1) into a semantic network
(Figure 2) to illustrate how they associate with
each other, e.g. with hierarchies.

Identifying and searching result in a list many
names with variations and meanings. In order
to find the correct person with a name we have
to adopt ontologies of names, e.g. based on
place of birth or relationship of people. The
typical origins of surnames which can be a ba-
sis for ontologies of names can be classified as
follows:
local surnames - surnames of relationship -
surnames of occupation or office.
Local surnames, which are most widely
used, stem from toponyms, we can call them
toponymic. They reflect land owners, place of
birth, or the center of life. For example, Rich-
ard de Tonebridge was named after his castle
of Tonbridge, but he was also called Richard
de Clara from the Suffolk Clare, which became
his chief seat and the family’s definitive sur-
name. Also Richard de Hadestoke, a London
alderman, had left Hadstock (Essex) and set-
tled in London (Reaney and Wilson 1997).
These local surnames derive (with occasional
exceptions) from English, Scottish or French
places (e.g. de, at, in). Toponymic Thai names
are derived from Thai places and took origi-
nally a preposition na, for example, Prapas na
Ranong is a person from a Southern province
in Thailand called Ranong.
Surnames which come from family relation
are often called patronymic, but we have to
introduce a more elaborate term, because we
encounter names from females and other rela-
tions than just father, such as Gilbert Fatheved-
steppeson, Richard Hannebrothir, America
Ibbotdoghter, and John Prestebruther.
Surnames of occupation and office refer to
actual office holders like clergy names or state
offices. Some of these, such as steward, con-
stable, marshal, etc., became hereditary and
gave rise to hereditary surnames, but the terms
were also commonly used of lesser offices,
whilst marshal was a common term for a far-
rier and such names frequently denoted the
actual occupation. However, Nuns, Abbots,
Priors, Monks and other clerical people were
bound by vows of celibacy and thus did usu-
ally not have families which adopted their re-
spective surname.

4 Rule Based Naming System for
Thai Names
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973914366666667">
In this section we introduce the well known
methodology for Thai naming process as well
as how Thai names can be constructed using
the basic Thai rules of forming syllables.
4.1 Custom Naming Process Using Thai
Astrology
The way of naming can vary, e.g. naming by
monks, grandparents. Since former times
names are very important to people. Naming
from the past to the present has been continu-
ously developed and has developed a variety of
patterns. Each pattern has it own rules depend-
ing on local places and the belief that has been
developed until the present. The basic goal of
naming is to provide a good fortune and pro-
gress during life. Most first names have a
meaning. The widely used methodology of
Thai naming process is briefly described in the
following.
Principal naming using Thai astrology is
widely used since the past. Because it uses the
birth day to form the name. This is a belief that
the individual has a set of 8 attributes called
name of the angles referred to in Thai astrol-
ogy. These attributes influence each person’s
livelihood, fortune, etc. The attributes refer to
Servant &gt;Age&gt; Power&gt; Honour&gt; Property&gt;
Diligence&gt; Patron&gt; Misfortune. Each attribute
has it own letters which can be used for con-
structing names.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986226">
4.2 Syllable Construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993130076923077">
Syllables are aggregated to names which sound
good or aimed at good fortune according to the
methodology mentioned above. As a consonant
can not stand alone in Thai language and per-
sonal names we consider rules for vowels only.
The order is:
Vowels can come first or can be followed
by a first consonant, e.g. Ek
Vowels can follow a first consonant with-
out a final consonant, e.g. Ka
Vowels that can not have final consonant,
e.g. Tam, Tua
Vowels that need final consonant, e.g. Kak

Example of construction of Thai syllables
using Thai Romanization 1.10 unicode (CU
2004) according to Figure 3: µ (Ka) = CV,
Á° (Ek) = VC,  (Kok) = CF, ´(Kak) =
CVF, Á° (Ek) = VF.
Thai names are built from one or more syl-
lables that may or may not have a meaning.
There are syllables which alone do not mean
much in particular, but when used as prefixes
and suffixes can change the meaning of the
syllables they precede or follow as stated be-
low.
Prefixes: for example, (1) kob means
&amp;quot;gather&amp;quot; while pra-kob means &amp;quot;put together&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;consist of&amp;quot;, (2) cham means &amp;quot;remember&amp;quot;
while pra-cham means &amp;quot;regularly&amp;quot;.
Suffixes: for example, (1) ngarm means
&amp;quot;beautiful&amp;quot; and num means &amp;quot;water&amp;quot;. Add jai
(&amp;quot;heart&amp;quot;) to each and we have names like
ngarm-jai and num-jai meaning &amp;quot;beautiful in
the heart&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;generous&amp;quot; respectively.
In the following it is shown how to con-
struct Thai names that convey a meaning with
the help of ontologies. Syllables are built from
consonants (either C or F, C being the first and
F the final consonant) and vowels. A name
consists of one or more syllables. One syllable
can have a meaning of its own, which leads in
case of two or more syllables in a name to
more complex meanings.
The process of constructing names accord-
ing to the naming rules and methodology be-
gins with a leading consonant or vowel that
can be the only letter in the name. If we con-
tinue to add more letters we come either to a
valid name (a name which has a meaning) or to
an invalid name (a name without a meaning).
Invalid names will be discarded in such a way
that the last letter will be replaced by another
or will be added with more letters.
In Figure 4 it is shown that names comprise
n syllables with a reasonable number of letters.
The meanings of the syllables as well as of the
name are found with the help of an ontology of
names.
The meaning of the name for a girl Pensri
in the example (see Figure 4) is “the goodness
and beauty of the moon”.
How do we know which name belongs to a
boy or a girl? There are several ideas to take
into consideration when selecting a name for
indicating the gender. Ontologies can help in
deciding the name by capturing and indexing
the meaning as is shown in Table 1.
Boys can be named by:

• taking names of leading or important
male characters accepted as having
lasting literary value, e.g. Chakkri (an
actor from KhunChang KhunPhaen)
and Suthat (an actor from Phra Aphai
Mani).
• combining monosyllables evidently
indicating the males sex, e.g. Chatri (a
mighty man), Choetchai (a perfect
man), and Danai (son).
• using adjectives indicating male quali-
ties such as strength, and bravery, e.g.
Watcharaphon (strength), woraphon
(strength), and Kriangkrai (brevery) .
• using terms representing something
strong, important or high, e.g. Suriya,
Phassakorn, and Phanuphong are
popular names. They all mean the sun.
Choosing names for girls is even more compli-
cated. There are so many things to consider
(Table 2). A girl can be named by:
• taking name of leading female charac-
ters from well-known literature: Phim
Phi La Lai (an actress from Khun-
Chang KhunPhaen) and Suwanmali
(an actress from Phra Aphai Mani).
• combining monosyllables evidently
indicating the females sex, e.g. Cha-
runi (pretty girl), Kanyarat (pretty
woman), Khanitda (younger sister),and
Khwansuda (beloved daughter).
• using syllables indicating female quali-
ties such as those having to do with
looks and beauty, e.g. Pariyaphat
(lovely) and Phichittra (beautiful).

grant) and Parimon (fragrant),
Mathurot (sweet) and Wasita (sweet

favourable tastes like Khom (bitter) or

4.3 Web Based Naming Expert System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947846153846">
Currently we are constructing and implementing
a web-based naming expert system which offers
two basic ways to come to “good” Thai names
according to the first methodology mentioned
above. The system will give us the letters for
each date of birth. We use these letters to con-
struct names based on the basic rules (see Figure
2). The user will be able to choose from a list of
resulting possible names according to their re-
spective meaning.
We use a dictionary database of more than
8.000 Thai names which contains not only the
spelling, but also the meaning and correct pro-

nunciation. In situations where names follow the
rules but do not have a meaning we compare the
name with similar names in a dictionary database
and check for similarity using a simple string
matching scheme. Then the user can select the
best name from the resulting list of names.
A second way to come to names is by using
ontologies instead of basic spelling rules which
are used according to the sex and date of birth.
For this we check the different names against the
date of birth by implementing an indexed data-
base system of names from Thai dictionary for
every day of a week.

5 Conclusion and Further Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914785714286">
We have used Thai customs for the naming proc-
ess, an ontology of names, and the basic rules for
forming syllables in Thai to construct the rule
based naming system. We want to extend the
system using name matching algorithms to return
the variants of names from a Thai dictionary with
the relative probability of their similarity. To
speed up this process we will use a database
structure based on an ontology of names, e.g. by
indexing names according to gender and mean-
ing with the help of a Thai dictionary database.
We will use a Romanized version of Thai names.
The advantage of this process would be an
improvement of searching algorithms for Thai
names in databases as well as in the internet.
Here we will need name matching algorithms.
The next step of development is to take into ac-
count different cultures.
Currently we are designing a system for mul-
ticultural name matching called NARESUAN-
M2 (NAme Recognition Expert System Using
Automated Name Matching Methods). A pri-
mary objective here is to study how ontologies
and algorithms can help in deciding which rules
of naming system have to be implemented. This
will also require an investigation into how on-
tologies that cover the different elements of
names can be merged.

The level of description will be taxonomies with hierarchically related terms and controlled vocabularies (thesaurus) with the help of semantic networks.

It is not likely that the resulting ID numbers will be the same in different organisations. The numbering may have limitations as well, e.g. the individual health care setting (e.g. within a hospital or district) or, in principle, more widely (e.g. the National Health Service number). In the past, the National Health Service number in England and Wales had serious limitations as a matching variable, and it was not widely used on health-care records. With the allocation of the new ten-digit number throughout the NHS all this has been changed (Gill, 1997). Although numbering systems are simple to implement they can lead to different errors in recording, transcripting, and keying. So we have to take into account methods which reduce these errors and facilitate good quality of data entry and retrieval. One such method uses a checking device such as check-digits (Wild, 1968, Hamming, 1986).

This attempts to tackle the seemingly irreducible conventions of surname. In compositional semantics let us consider the name “Gutensohn”. This name will be used to illustrate the various semantic considerations in German naming. The name is a composition of the two strings Godith and Sohn, which have unambiguous, meaningful interpretations. The interpretation of Godith is god or good battle and Sohn is interpreted as a male child in relation to his parent. The composition Gutsohn, Gudzon, or in other cultures: Guditson, Godyeson and Godithson and Godison (Reaney and Wilson 1997). We incorporate the different elements of personal names (Figure 1) into a semantic network (Figure 2) to illustrate how they associate with each other, e.g. with hierarchies. Figure 2: Representation of the names elements using semantic nets 88 Identifying and searching result in a list many names with variations and meanings. In order to find the correct person with a name we have to adopt ontologies of names, e.g. based on place of birth or relationship of people. The typical origins of surnames which can be a basis for ontologies of names can be classified as follows: local surnames - sur</context>
