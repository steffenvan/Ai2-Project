Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999878916666667">
We propose an algorithm to resolve
anaphors, tackling mainly the problem of
intrasentential antecedents. We base our
methodology on the fact that such an-
tecedents are likely to occur in embedded
sentences. Sidner&apos;s focusing mechanism is
used as the basic algorithm in a more com-
plete approach. The proposed algorithm
has been tested and implemented as a part
of a conceptual analyser, mainly to pro-
cess pronouns. Details of an evaluation are
given.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999729864864865">
Intrasentential antecedents, i.e., antecedents occur-
ring in the same sentence as the anaphor, are a cru-
cial issue for the anaphora resolution method. The
main problem is to determine the constraints that
intrasentential phrases must respect in anaphoric re-
lations. These constraints are used to determine re-
lations between a given anaphor and its antecedents.
Until now, this kind of constraint has been tackled
mainly in terms of syntactic aspects, see (Lappin and
Leass, 1994) (Merlo, 1993) and (Hobbs, 1985). We
propose to consider new kinds of criteria that com-
bine semantic restrictions with sentence structure.
One of these criteria is, for example, the way
in which the verb meaning influences the sentence
structure, then the way in which the sentence struc-
ture influences the anaphoric relations between in-
trasentential phrases. The structure we studied is
the embedded sentence structure. Indeed, an im-
portant assumption we have made is that embedded
sentences favour the occurrence of intrasentential an-
tecedents. We exploit the focusing mechanism pro-
posed by Sidner (Sidner, 1979) (Sidner, 1981) (Sid-
ner, 1983) extending and refining her algorithms.
The algorithm is designed for anaphors generally,
even if we focus mainly on pronouns in this paper.
Indeed, the distinction between different kinds of
anaphors is made at the level of anaphor interpreta-
tion rules. These resolution rule aspects will not be
developed here; though they have been developed in
the literature, e.g., see (Carter, 1987), and (Sidner,
1981) (Sidner, 1983). We focus more on the mecha-
nisms that handle these different kinds of rules.
We first present how intrasentential antecedents
occur in embedded sentences. We recall the main
ideas of the focusing approach, then expand on
the main hypotheses which led the design of the
anaphora resolution algorithm.

events
An embedded sentence contains either more than
one verb or a verb and derivations of other verbs
(see sentence 1 with verbs said and forming).
1) Three of the world&apos;s leading advertis-
ing groups, Agence Havas S.A. of France,
Young &amp; Rubicam of the U.S. and Dentsu
Inc. of Japan, said they are forming a
global advertising joint venture.
Broadly speaking embedded sentences concern more
than one fact. In sentence 1 there is the fact of saying
something and that of forming a joint venture. We
call such a fact an elementary event (EE hereafter).
Thus an embedded sentence will contain several EEs.
Factors that influence embedded sentences are
mainly semantic features of verbs. For example
the verb to say, that takes a sentence complement
favours an introduction of a new fact, i.e., &amp;quot;to say
something&amp;quot;, and the related fact. There are other
classes of verbs such as want to, hope that, and so
on. In the following, subordinate phrases, like rel-
ative or causal sentences, will be also considered as
embedded ones.
2.2 Embedded sentences with
intrasentential antecedents
First of all, we will distinguish the Possessive, Recip-
rocal and Reflexive pronouns (PRR hereafter) from
the other pronouns (non-PRR hereafter).

On the basis of 120 articles, of 4 sentences on av-
erage, containing 332 pronouns altogether, we made
the following assumption (1):
Assumption: non-PRR pronouns can have in-
trasentential antecedents, only if these pro-
nouns occur in an embedded sentence.
The statistics below show that of 262 non-PRR
pronouns, there are 244 having intrasentential an-
tecedents, all of which occur in embedded sentences
and none in a &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; sentence. The remaining 18
non-PRR pronouns have intersentential antecedents.
Pronouns 332
non-PRR 262
With intrasentential antecedents 244
in an embedded sentence
With intrasentential in a simple 0
sentence
With intersentential antecedents 18
Our assumption means that, while the PRR pro-
nouns may find their antecedents in an non embed-
ded sentence (e.g., sentences 2 and 3) the non-PRR
pronouns can not.

Telescan in May, 1992.

Without jumping to conclusions, we cannot avoid
making a parallel with the topological relations de-
fined in the binding theory (Chomsky, 1980), be-
tween two coreferring phrases in the syntactic tree
level. Assumption 1 redefines these relations in an
informal and less rigorous way, at the semantic level,
i.e., considering semantic parameters such as the
type of verbs that introduce embedded sentences.

2.3 Using Sidner&apos;s Focusing Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914111111111">
To resolve anaphors one of the most suitable existing
approaches when dealing with anaphor issues in a
conceptual analysis process is the focusing approach
proposed by Sidner. However, this mechanism is
not suitable for intrasentential cases. We propose
to exploit its main advantages in order to build our
anaphora resolution mechanism extending it to deal
also with intrasentential antecedents.
We describe the main elements of the focusing ap-
proach that are necessary to understand our method,
without going into great detail, see (Sidner, 1979)
(Sidner, 1981) (Sidner, 1983). Sidner proposed a
methodology, modelling the way &amp;quot;focus&amp;quot; of attention
and anaphor resolution influence one another. Us-
ing pronouns reflects what the speaker has focused
on in the previous sentence, so that the focus is that
phrase which the pronouns refer to. The resolution
is organised through the following processes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.664230961538462">
• The expected focus algorithm that selects an
initial focus called the &amp;quot;expected focus&amp;quot;. This
selection may be &amp;quot;confirmed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rejected&amp;quot; in
subsequent sentences. The expected focus is
generally chosen on the basis of the verb seman-
tic categories. There is a preference in terms
of thematic position: the &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot; (as used by
Gruber and Anderson, 1976 for the notion of
the object case of a verb) is the first, followed
by the goal, the instrument and the location or-
dered according to their occurrence in the sen-
tence; the final item is the agent that is selected
when no other role suits.
• The anaphora interpreter uses the state of the
focus and a set of algorithms associated with
each anaphor type to determine which element
of the data structures is the antecedent. Each
algorithm is a filter containing several interpre-
tation rules (IR).
Each IR in the algorithm appropriate to an
anaphor suggests one or several antecedents de-
pending on the focus and on the anaphor type.
• An evaluation of the proposed antecedents is
performed using different kinds of criteria (syn-
tax, semantics, inferential, etc.)
• The focusing algorithm makes use of data struc-

<bodyText confidence="0.84210015">
tures, i.e., the focus registers that represent the
state of the focus: the current focus (CF) repre-
sentation, alternate focus list (AFL) that con-
tains the other phrases of the sentence and the
focus stack (FS). A parallel structure to the CF
is also set to deal with the agentive pronouns.
The focusing algorithm updates the state of the
focus after each sentence anaphor (except the
first sentence). After the first sentence, it con-
firms or rejects the predicted focus taking into
account the results of anaphor interpretation.
In the case of rejection, it determines which
phrase is to move into focus.
This is a brief example (Sidner 1983) :
a Alfred and Zohar liked to play baseball.
b They played it every day after school before din-
ner.
c After their game, Alfred and Zohar had ice
cream cones.
d They tasted really good.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998346625">
• In a) the expected focus is &amp;quot;baseball&amp;quot; (the
theme)
• In b) &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; refers to &amp;quot;baseball&amp;quot; (CF). &amp;quot;they&amp;quot;
refers to Alfred and Zohar (AF)
• The focusing algorithm confirms the CF.
• In d) &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; refers to &amp;quot;ice cream cones&amp;quot; in AFL.
• The focusing algorithm decides that since no
anaphor refers to the CF, the CF is stacked and

2.4 What needs to be improved in the
focusing approach?
2.4.1 Intrasentential antecedents
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983074642857143">
The focusing approach always prefers the previ-
ous sentences&apos; entities as antecedents to the current
sentences. In fact only previous sentence entities
are present in the focus registers. Thus phrases of
the current sentence can not be proposed as an-
tecedents. This problem has already been under-
lined, see (Carter, 1987) in particular who pro-
posed augmenting the focus registers with the en-
tities of the current sentence. For example in sen-
tence 4 while the focus algorithm would propose
only &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; as an antecedent for &amp;quot;him&amp;quot;, in Carter&apos;s
method &amp;quot;Bill&amp;quot; will also be proposed.

2.4.2 Initial Anaphors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969125">
The focusing mechanism fails in the expected fo-
cus algorithm when encountering anaphors occur-
ring in the first sentence of a text, which we call
initial anaphors, such as They in sentence (1). The
problem with initial anaphors is that the focus reg-
isters cannot be initialised or may be wrongly filled
if there are anaphors inside the first sentence of the
text. It is clear that taking the sentence in its classi-
cal meaning as the unit of processing in the focusing
approach, is not suitable when sentences are embed-
ded.
We will focus on the mechanisms and algorithmic
aspects of the resolution (how to fill the registers,
how to structure algorithms, etc.) and not on the
rule aspects, like how IRs decide to choose Bill and
not John (sentence 4).

3 Our Solution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999733">
As stated above, embedded sentences include sev-
eral elementary events (EEs). EEs are represented
as conceptual entities in our work. We consider
that such successive EEs involve the same context
that is introduced by several successive short sen-
tences. Moreover, our assumption states that when
non-PRR anaphors have intrasentential antecedents,
they occur in embedded sentences. Starting with
these considerations, the algorithm is governed by
the hypotheses expanded below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999174">
3.1 Main hypotheses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9958756">
First hypothesis : EE is the unit of processing in
the basic focusing cycle.
An EE is the unit of processing in our resolution al-
gorithm instead of the sentence. The basic focusing
cycle is applied on each EE in turn and not sentence
by sentence. Notice that a simple sentence coincides
with its EE.
Second hypothesis : The &amp;quot;initial&amp;quot; EE of a well
formed first sentence does not contain non-PRR
pronouns just as an initial simple sentence can-
not.
For example, in the splitting of sentence 1 into two
EEs (see below), EE1 does not contain non-PRR
pronouns because it is the initial EE of the whole
discourse.

<listItem confidence="0.966499166666667">
EE1) &amp;quot;Three of the world&apos;s leading adver-
tising groups, Agence Havas S.A. of France,
Young St Rubicam of the U.S. and Dentsu

EE2) &amp;quot;they are forming a global advertis-
ing joint venture.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.967502857142857">
Third hypothesis : PRR pronouns require special
treatment.
PRR could refer to intrasentential antecedents in
simple sentences (such as in those of sentences 3 and
4). An initial EE could then contain an anaphor of
the PRR type. Our approach is to add a special
phase that resolves first the PRRs occurring in the
initial EE before applying the expected focusing al-
gorithm on the same initial EE. In all other cases,
PRRs are treated equally to other pronouns.
This early resolution relies on the fact that the
PRR pronouns may refer to the agent, as in sentence
3, as well as to the complement phrases. However
the ambiguity will not be huge at this first level of
the treatment. Syntactic and semantic features can
easily be used to resolve these anaphors. This relies
also on the fact that the subject of the initial EE
cannot be a pronoun (second hypothesis).
Having mentioned this particular case of PRR in
initial EE, we now expand on the whole algorithm
of resolution.

3.2 The Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>

The algorithm is based on the decomposition of
the sentence into EEs and the application of the ba-

The complete steps are given below (see also figure

Step 1 Split the sentence, i.e., its semantic repre-
sentation, into EEs.
Step 2 Apply the expected focus algorithm to the
first EE.
Step 3 Perform the basic focusing cycle for every
anaphor of all the EEs of the current sentence.
Step 4 Perform a collective evaluation (i.e., evalu-
ation that involves all the anaphors of the sen-
tence), when all the anaphors of the current sen-
tence are processed.
Step 5 Process the next sentence until all the sen-
tences are processed:

3.3 Examples and results

<bodyText confidence="0.973187722222222">
To illustrate the algorithm, let&apos;s consider the follow-
ing sentence :
Lafarge Coppee said it would buy 10 per-
cent in National Gypsum, the number two
plasterboard company in the US, a pur-
chase which allows it to be present on the
world&apos;s biggest plasterboard market.
At the conceptual level, there are 3 EEs. They are
involved respectively by the said, buy, and allows
verbs. They correspond respectively to the following
surface sentences:
EE1 &amp;quot;Lafarge Coppee said&amp;quot;
EE2 &amp;quot;it would buy 10 percent in National Gypsum,
the number two plasterboard company in the
US&amp;quot;
EE3 &amp;quot;a purchase which allows it to be present on the
world&apos;s biggest plasterboard market.&amp;quot;
Consider the algorithm:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994982444444444">
• the expected focusing algorithm is applied to
the first EE, EE1, which contains non-PRR
anaphors.
• the other phases of the algorithm, i.e., the basic
focusing cycle, are applied to the subsequent
EEs:

resolved by the basic focusing cycle
— it in EE3 will be resolved in the same way.

<bodyText confidence="0.999745421052632">
The anaphora resolution has been implemented as
a part of a conceptual analyser (Azzam, 1995a). It
dealt particularly with pronouns. It has been tested
on a set of 120 news reports. We made two kinds
of algorithm evaluations: the evaluation of the im-
plemented procedure and an evaluation by hand.
For the implementation the success rate of resolu-
tion was 70%. The main cases of failure are related
to the non implemented aspects like the treatment
of coordination ambiguities and the appositions, or
other anaphoric phenomena, like ellipsis.
For the second evaluation which concerns the real
evaluation of the approach,i.e., without going into
the practical issues concerning implementation, the
success rate was 95%. The main cases of failure were
due to the cases that were not considered by the
algorithm, like for example the pronouns occurring
before their antecedents , i.e., cataphors. Such cases
occur for example in sentences 5 and 6 pointed out

not handled easily in the literature.
5) Mary sacked out in his apartment before
Sam could kick her out.
6) Girls who he has dated say that Sam is
charming.
Our algorithm fails in resolving his in 5, because
the algorithm searches only for the entities that pre-
cede the anaphor in the text. The same applies for
he in 6. However improving our algorithm to process
classical cases of cataphors, such as that in sentence
6, should not require major modifications, only a
change in the order in which the EEs are searched.
For example, to process pronouns of the sentence
6 split into two EES (see below), the algorithm must
consider EE2 before EEL This means applying the
step 2 of the algorithm to EE2, then step 3 to EEL

though.

In 7 our algorithm is successful, i.e., it will not iden-
tify him with John because of our previous assump-
tion (section 2.2). However our algorithm would fail
in 8 because the non-PRR pronoun him could refer
to John which occurs in the same EE.
Notice that Hobbs&apos; (Hobbs, 1985) remark that
&amp;quot;the more deeply the pronoun is embedded and the
more elaborate the construction it occurs in, the
more acceptable the non reflexive&amp;quot; is consistent with
our assumption.
For example in the embedded sentence 9 where ei-
ther the reflexive (himself) or non reflexive pronouns
(him) may be used, it is more natural to make use
of him.
9) John claimed that the picture of him
hanging in the post office was a fraud.

4 The Conceptual Level
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946416666667">
We comment here on the main aspects of the con-
ceptual analysis that are related to the anaphora
resolution process. They concern mainly the way of
splitting embedded sentences and the problems of
determining the theme and of managing the other
ambiguities and the several readings.
The conceptual analyser&apos;s strategy consists of a
continuous step-by-step translation of the original
natural language sentences into conceptual struc-
tures (CS hereafter). This translation uses the re-
sults of the syntactic analysis (syntactic tree). It is
a progressive substitution of the NL terms located
in the syntactic tree with concepts and templates of
the conceptual representation language. Triggering
rules are evoked by words of the sentence and allow
the activation of well-formed CS templates when the
syntactico-semantic filter is unified with the syntac-
tic tree. The values caught by the filter variables
are the arguments of the CS roles, i.e., they fill the
CS roles. If they are anaphors, they are considered
to be unbound variables and result in unfilled roles
in the CS. The anaphora resolution aims therefore
at filling the unfilled roles with the corresponding
antecedents.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999707">
4.1 Splitting into EEs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999709111111111">
The splitting of a sentence in EE is done on the
corresponding CS. A minimal CS is a template com-
prising a predicate that identifies the basic type of
the represented event and a set of roles or predicate
cases.
For example, the sentence &amp;quot;to say that they agree
to form a joint venture&amp;quot; is represented, in a simpli-
fied way, with three templates, corresponding to the
predicates:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999444333333333">
• move information (from &amp;quot;to say&amp;quot;),
• produce an agreement (from &amp;quot;to agree&amp;quot;),
• produce a joint venture (from &amp;quot;to form&amp;quot;).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978375">
Given that one template at the semantic level repre-
sents an elementary event, the splitting is implicitly
already done when these templates are created in the
triggering phase. Indeed, the syntactico-semantic
filter of the triggering rules takes into account the
semantic features of words (mainly verbs) for recog-
nising in the surface sentence those that are able to
trigger an elementary event.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992111">
4.2 Determining the theme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957571428571">
Gruber and Anderson characterise the theme as fol-
lows: if a verb describes a change to some entity,
whether of position, activity, class or possession,
then the theme is the changed entity, (Gruber, 1976)
and (Anderson, 1977). As Carter (Carter, 1987)
demonstrated, this definition of Gruber and Ander-
son is sufficient to apply the focusing mechanism.
This assumption is particularly apt when we dispose
of a conceptual representation. Indeed, to deter-
mine the thematic roles, we established a set of the-
matic rules that affect for a given predicative occur-
rence, its thematic functions according to the predi-
cate type, the role type and the argument&apos;s semantic
class.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99994">
4.3 Managing other ambiguities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999555">
An important aspect appears when one designs a
concrete system, namely how to make other dis-
ambiguation processes cohabit. In the concep-
tual analyser, the general disambiguation module
(GDM) deals with other ambiguities, like preposi-
tional phrase attachment. It coordinates the treat-
</bodyText>

267

<bodyText confidence="0.999948545454545">
ment of different kinds of ambiguities. This is nec-
essary because the conceptual structures (CS) on
which the rules are performed could be incomplete
because of other types of ambiguities not being re-
solved. For example, if the CF of the sentence is
a PP object that is not attached yet in the CS the
thematic rules fail to fill the CF. The GDM ensures
that every disambiguation module intervenes only
if previous ambiguities have already been resolved.
The process of co-ordinating ambiguity processing is
fully expanded in (Azzam, 1995b).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998879">
4.4 Multiple readings
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998528666666667">
When dealing with ambiguities, another important
aspect is managing multiple readings. At a certain
point when the GDM calls the anaphora module to
deal with a given anaphor, the status of the concep-
tual analysis could be characterised by the following
parameters :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.872091090909091">
• The set of conceptual structures for the current
reading Ri on which the resolution is performed,
given that several readings could arise from pre-
vious ambiguity processing.
• The set of conceptual structures of the current
sentence Si where the anaphor occurs;
• The set of conceptual structures of the current
elementary event EEi where the anaphor occurs
after the Si splitting.
• The state of the focus (content of the registers),

The main assumption is that the anaphora resolu-
tion algorithm always applies to a single state, (Ri,
Si , EEi, SFi) when resolving a given anaphor (Step
3) :
a If several antecedents are still possible after the
individual evaluation of the anaphor, Ri is then
duplicated, in Rij, as many times as there are
possibilities.
b When performing the collective evaluation of
all Si anaphors, every inconsistent Rij is sup-
pressed.
c The result is a set of readings (Ru, Sj , EEj,

<bodyText confidence="0.999985379310345">
We have proposed a methodology to resolve
anaphors occurring in embedded sentences. The
main idea of the methodology is the use of other
kinds of restrictions between the anaphor and its an-
tecedents than the syntactic ones. We demonstrated
that anaphors with intrasentential antecedents are
closely related to embedded sentences and we
showed how to exploit this data to design the
anaphora resolution methodology. Mainly, we ex-
ploited Sidner&apos;s focusing mechanism, refining the
classical unit of processing, that is the sentence, to
that of the elementary event. The algorithm has
been implemented (in Common Lisp, Sun Sparc) to
deal with pronouns as a part of a deep analyser. The
main advantages of the proposed algorithm is that
it is independent from the knowledge representation
language used and the deep understanding approach
in which it is integrated. Thus, it could be set up in
any conceptual analyser, as long as a semantic rep-
resentation of the text is available. Moreover Sid-
ner&apos;s approach does not impose its own formalisms
(syntactic or semantic) for its application. The im-
provement of the proposed algorithm requires deal-
ing with special cases of anaphors such as cataphors
and also with specific cases which are not easily han-
dled in the literature. For example, we saw that a
solution to processing cataphors could be to recon-
sider the order in which the conceptual structures
(elementary events beforehand) are searched.

Indeed, an important assumption we have made is that embedded sentences favour the occurrence of intrasentential antecedents. We exploit the focusing mechanism proposed by Sidner (Sidner, 1979) (Sidner, 1981) (Sidner, 1983) extending and refining her algorithms. The algorithm is designed for anaphors generally, even if we focus mainly on pronouns in this paper. Indeed, the distinction between different kinds of anaphors is made at the level of anaphor interpretation rules. These resolution rule aspects will not be developed here; though they have been developed in the literature, e.g., see (Carter, 1987), and (Sidner, 1981) (Sidner, 1983). We focus more on the mechanisms that handle these different kinds of rules. We first present how intrasentential antecedents occur in embedded sentences. We recall the main ideas of the focusing approach, then expand on the main hypotheses which led the design of the anaphora resolution algorithm. 2 Intrasentential Antecedents 2.1 Embedded sentences and elementary events An embedded sentence contains either more than one verb or a verb and derivations of other verbs (see sentence 1 with verbs said and forming). 1) Three of the world&apos;s leading advertising gr</context>

We call a basic focusing cycle the cycle that includes : • the focusing algorithm • followed by the interpretation of anaphors, • then by the evaluation of the proposed antecedents. 2.4 What needs to be improved in the focusing approach? 2.4.1 Intrasentential antecedents The focusing approach always prefers the previous sentences&apos; entities as antecedents to the current sentences. In fact only previous sentence entities are present in the focus registers. Thus phrases of the current sentence can not be proposed as antecedents. This problem has already been underlined, see (Carter, 1987) in particular who proposed augmenting the focus registers with the entities of the current sentence. For example in sentence 4 while the focus algorithm would propose only &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; as an antecedent for &amp;quot;him&amp;quot;, in Carter&apos;s method &amp;quot;Bill&amp;quot; will also be proposed. 4) John walked into the room. He told Bill someone wanted to see him. 2.4.2 Initial Anaphors The focusing mechanism fails in the expected focus algorithm when encountering anaphors occurring in the first sentence of a text, which we call initial anaphors, such as They in sentence (1). The problem with initial anaphors is that the focus regis</context>

We propose to exploit its main advantages in order to build our anaphora resolution mechanism extending it to deal also with intrasentential antecedents. We describe the main elements of the focusing approach that are necessary to understand our method, without going into great detail, see (Sidner, 1979) (Sidner, 1981) (Sidner, 1983). Sidner proposed a methodology, modelling the way &amp;quot;focus&amp;quot; of attention and anaphor resolution influence one another. Using pronouns reflects what the speaker has focused on in the previous sentence, so that the focus is that phrase which the pronouns refer to. The resolution is organised through the following processes: • The expected focus algorithm that selects an initial focus called the &amp;quot;expected focus&amp;quot;. This selection may be &amp;quot;confirmed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rejected&amp;quot; in subsequent sentences. The expected focus is generally chosen on the basis of the verb semantic categories.</context>

We propose to consider new kinds of criteria that combine semantic restrictions with sentence structure. One of these criteria is, for example, the way in which the verb meaning influences the sentence structure, then the way in which the sentence structure influences the anaphoric relations between intrasentential phrases. The structure we studied is the embedded sentence structure. Indeed, an important assumption we have made is that embedded sentences favour the occurrence of intrasentential antecedents. We exploit the focusing mechanism proposed by Sidner (Sidner, 1979) (Sidner, 1981) (Sidner, 1983) extending and refining her algorithms. The algorithm is designed for anaphors generally, even if we focus mainly on pronouns in this paper. Indeed, the distinction between different kinds of anaphors is made at the level of anaphor interpretation rules. These resolution rule aspects will not be developed here; though they have been developed in the literature, e.g., see (Carter, 1987), and (Sidner, 1981) (Sidner, 1983). We focus more on the mechanisms that handle these different kinds of rules. We first present how intrasentential antecedents occur in embedded sentences. We rec</context>

A parallel structure to the CF is also set to deal with the agentive pronouns. The focusing algorithm updates the state of the focus after each sentence anaphor (except the first sentence). After the first sentence, it confirms or rejects the predicted focus taking into account the results of anaphor interpretation. In the case of rejection, it determines which phrase is to move into focus. This is a brief example (Sidner 1983) : a Alfred and Zohar liked to play baseball. b They played it every day after school before dinner. c After their game, Alfred and Zohar had ice cream cones. d They tasted really good. • In a) the expected focus is &amp;quot;baseball&amp;quot; (the theme) • In b) &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; refers to &amp;quot;baseball&amp;quot; (CF). &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; refers to Alfred and Zohar (AF) • The focusing algorithm confirms the CF. • In d) &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; refers to &amp;quot;ice cream cones&amp;quot; in AFL. • The focusing algorithm decides that since no anaphor refers to the CF, the CF is stacked and 264 &amp;quot;ice cream cones&amp;quot; is the new CF (focus movement).
