We address the problem of classifying
multiword expression tokens in running
text. We focus our study on Verb-Noun
Constructions (VNC) that vary in their id-
iomaticity depending on context. VNC
tokens are classified as either idiomatic
or literal. Our approach hinges upon
the assumption that a literal VNC will
have more in common with its component
words than an idiomatic one. Commonal-
ity is measured by contextual overlap. To
this end, we set out to explore different
contextual variations and different similar-
ity measures handling the sparsity in the
possible contexts via four different param-
eter variations. Our approach yields state
of the art performance with an overall ac-
curacy of 75.54% on a TEST data set.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999348242424243">
A Multi-Word Expression (MWE), for our pur-
poses, can be defined as a multi-word unit that
refers to a single concept, for example - kick the
bucket, spill the beans, make a decision, etc. An
MWE typically has an idiosyncratic meaning that
is more or different than the meaning of its compo-
nent words. An MWE meaning is transparent, i.e.
predictable, in as much as the component words
in the expression relay the meaning portended by
the speaker compositionally. Accordingly, MWEs
vary in their degree of meaning compositionality;
compositionality is correlated with the level of id-
iomaticity. An MWE is compositional if the mean-
ing of an MWE as a unit can be predicted from the
meaning of its component words such as in make
a decision meaning to decide. If we conceive of
idiomaticity as being a continuum, the more id-
iomatic an expression, the less transparent and the
more non-compositional it is.
MWEs are pervasive in natural language, espe-
cially in web based texts and speech genres. Iden-
tifying MWEs and understanding their meaning is
essential to language understanding, hence they
are of crucial importance for any Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) applications that aim at
handling robust language meaning and use.
To date, most research has addressed the prob-
lem of MWE type classification for VNC expres-
sions in English (Melamed, 1997; Lin, 1999;
Baldwin et al., 2003; na Villada Moir´on and
Tiedemann, 2006; Fazly and Stevenson, 2007;
Van de Cruys and Villada Moir´on, 2007; Mc-
Carthy et al., 2007), not token classification. For
example: he spilt the beans over the kitchen
counter is most likely a literal usage. This is given
away by the use of the prepositional phrase over
the kitchen counter, since it is plausable that beans
could have literally been spilt on a location such as
a kitchen counter. Most previous research would
classify spilt the beans as idiomatic irrespective of
usage. A recent study by (Cook et al., 2008) of
60 idiom MWE types concluded that almost half
of them had clear literal meaning and over 40% of
their usages in text were actually literal. Thus, it
would be important for an NLP application such
as machine translation, for example, when given a
new MWE token, to be able to determine whether
it is used idiomatically or not.
In this paper, we address the problem of MWE
classification for verb-noun (VNC) token con-
structions in running text. We investigate the bi-
nary classification of an unseen VNC token ex-
pression as being either Idiomatic (IDM) or Lit-
eral (LIT). An IDM expression is certainly an
MWE, however, the converse is not necessarily
true. We handle the problem of sparsity for MWE
classification by exploring different vector space
features: various vector similarity metrics, and
more linguistically oriented feature sets. We eval-
uate our results against a standard data set from the
study by (Cook et al., 2007). We achieve state of
the art performance in classifying VNC tokens as
either literal (F-measure: Fβ1=0.64) or idiomatic
(Fβ1=0.82), corresponding to an overall accuracy
of 75.54%.

MWEs are typically not productive, though they
allow for inflectional variation (Sag et al., 2002).
They have been conventionalized due to persistent
use. MWEs can be classified based on their se-
mantic types as follows. Idiomatic: This category
includes expressions that are semantically non-
compositional, fixed expressions such as kingdom
come, ad hoc, non-fixed expressions such as break
new ground, speak of the devil. Semi-idiomatic:
This class includes expressions that seem seman-
tically non-compositional, yet their semantics are
more or less transparent. This category consists
of Light Verb Constructions (LVC) such as make
a living and Verb Particle Constructions (VPC)
such as write-up, call-up. Non-Idiomatic: This
category includes expressions that are semanti-
cally compositional such as prime minister, proper
nouns such as New York Yankees.

Several researchers have addressed the problem of
MWE classification (Baldwin et al., 2003; Katz
and Giesbrecht, 2006; Schone and Juraksfy, 2001;
Hashimoto et al., 2006; Hashimoto and Kawahara,
2008). The majority of the proposed research has
been using unsupervised approaches and have ad-
dressed the problem of MWE type classification
irrespective of usage in context. Only, the work
by Hashimoto et al. (2006) and Hashimoto and
Kawahara (2008) addressed token classification in
Japanese using supervised learning.
The most comparable work to ours is the re-
search by (Cook et al., 2007) and (Fazly and
Stevenson, 2007). On the other hand, (Cook et
al., 2007) develop an unsupervised technique that
classifies a VNC expression as idiomatic or literal.
They examine if the similarity between the con-
text vector of the MWE, in this case the VNC,
and that of its idiomatic usage is higher than the
similarity between its context vector and that of
its literal usage. They define the vector dimen-
sions in terms of the co-occurrence frequencies of
1000 most frequent content bearing words (nouns,
verbs, adjectives, adverbs and determiners) in the
corpus. A context vector for a VNC expression
is defined in terms of the words in the sentence
in which it occurs. They employ the cosine mea-
sure to estimate similarity between contextual vec-
tors. They assume that every instance of an ex-
pression occurring in a certain canonical syntactic
form is idiomatic, otherwise it is literal. This as-
sumption holds for many cases of idiomatic usage
since many of them are conventionalized, however
in cases such as spilt the beans on the counter top,
the expression would be misclassified as idiomatic
since it does occur in the canonical form though
the meaning in this case is literal. Their work
is similar to this paper in that they explore the
VNC expressions at the token level. Their method
achieves an accuracy of 52.7% on a data set con-
taining expression tokens used mostly in their lit-
eral sense, whereas it yields an accuracy of 82.3%
on a data set in which most usages are idiomatic.
Further, they report that a classifier that predicts
the idiomatic label if an expression (token) occurs
in a canonical form achieves an accuracy of 53.4%
on the former data set (where the majority of the
MWEs occur in their literal sense) and 84.7% on
the latter data set (where the majority of the MWE
instances are idiomatic). This indicates that these
‘canonical’ forms can still be used literally. They
report an overall system performance accuracy of
72.4%.1
(Fazly and Stevenson, 2007) correlate compo-
sitionality with idiomaticity. They measure com-
positionality as a combination of two similarity
values: firstly, similar to (Katz and Giesbrecht,
2006), the similarity (cosine similarity) between
the context of a VNC and the contexts of its con-
stituent words; secondly, the similarity between an
expression’s context and that of a verb that is mor-
phologically related to the noun in the expression,
for instance, decide for make a decision. Context
context(t) of an expression or a word, t, is de-
fined as a vector of the frequencies of nouns co-
occurring with t within a window of ±5 words.
The resulting compositionality measure yields an
Fβ=1=0.51 on identifying literal expressions and
Fβ=1=0.42 on identifying idiomatic expressions.
However their results are not comparable to ours
since it is type-based study.

4 Our Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977752941177">
Recognizing the significance of contextual infor-
mation in MWE token classification, we explore
the space of contextual modeling for the task of
classifying the token instances of VNC expres-
sions into literal versus idiomatic expressions. In-
spired by works of (Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006;
Fazly and Stevenson, 2007), our approach is to
compare the context vector of a VNC with the
composed vector of the verb and noun (V-N) com-
ponent units of the VNC when they occur in iso-
lation of each other (i.e., not as a VNC). For ex-
ample, in the case of the MWE kick the bucket, we
compare the contexts of the instances of the VNC
kick the bucket against the combined contexts for
the verb (V) kick, independent of the noun bucket,
and the contexts for the noun (N) bucket, indepen-
dent of the verb kick. The intuition is that if there
is a high similarity between the VNC and the com-
bined V and N (namely, the V-N vector) contexts
then the VNC token is compositional, hence a lit-
eral instance of the MWE, otherwise the VNC to-
ken is idiomatic.
Previous work, (Fazly and Stevenson, 2007),
restricted context to within the boundaries of the
sentences in which the tokens of interest oc-
curred. We take a cue from that work but de-
fine ‘context(t)’ as a vector with dimensions as
all word types occurring in the same sentence as
t, where t is a verb type corresponding to the V
in the VNC, noun type corresponding to N in the
VNC, or VNC expression instance. Moreover, our
definition of context includes all nouns, verbs, ad-
jectives and adverbs occurring in the same para-
graph as t. This broader notion of context should
help reduce sparseness effects, simply by enrich-
ing the vector with more contextual information.
Further, we realize the importance of some closed
class words occurring in the vicinity of t. (Cook
et al., 2007) report the importance of determin-
ers in identifying idiomaticity. Prepositions too
should be informative of idiomaticity (or literal us-
age) as illustrated above in spill the beans on the
kitchen counter. Hence, we include determiners
and prepositions occurring in the same sentence as
t. The composed V-N contextual vector combines
the co-occurrence of the verb type (aggregation of
all the verb token instances in the whole corpus)
as well as the noun type with this predefined set
of dimensions. The VNC contextual vector is that
for a specific instance of a VNC expression.
Our objective is to find the best experimental
settings that could yield the most accurate classifi-
cation of VNC expression tokens taking into con-
sideration the sparsity problem. To that end, we
explore the space of possible parameter variation
on the vectors representing our tokens of interest
(VNC, V, or N). We experiment with five different
parameter settings:
Context-Extent The definition of context is
broad or narrow described as follows. Both
ContextBroad and ContextNarrow comprise all
the open class or content words (nouns, verbs, ad-
jectives and adverbs), determiners, and preposi-
tions in the sentence containing the token. More-
over, ContextBroad, additionally, includes the
content words from the paragraph in which the
token occurs.
Dimension This is a pruning parameter on the
words included from the Context Extent. The in-
tuition is that salient words should have a big-
ger impact on the calculation of the vector sim-
ilarity. This parameter is varied in three ways:
DimensionNoThresh includes all the words that
co-occur with the token under consideration in
the specified context extent; DimensionFreq
sets a threshold on the co-occurrence frequency
for the words to include in the dimensions
thereby reducing the dimensionality of the vectors.
DimensionRatio is inspired by the utility of the
tf-idf measure in information retrieval, we devise
a threshold scheme that takes into consideration
the salience of the word in context as a function of
its relative frequency. Hence the raw frequencies
of the words in context are converted to a ratio of
two probabilities as per the following equation.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999277">
ratio = p(wordlcontext)

(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999794">
where N is the number of words (tokens) in
the corpus and freq(context) is the number of
contexts for a specific token of interest occurs.
The numerator of the ratio is the probability that
the word occurs in a particular context. The de-
nominator is the probability of occurrence of the
word in the corpus. Here, more weight is placed
on words that are frequent in a certain context but
rarer in the entire corpus. In case of the V and N
contexts, a suitable threshold, which is indepen-

dent of data size, is determined on this ratio in or-
der to prune context words.
The latter two pruning techniques,
DimensionFreQ and DimensionRatio, are
not performed for a VNC token’s context, hence,
all the words in the VNC token’s contextual
window are included. These thresholding meth-
ods are only applied to V-N composed vectors
obtained from the combination of the verb and
noun vectors.
Context-Content This parameter had two set-
tings: words as they occur in the cor-
pus, Context − ContentWords; or some of
the words are collapsed into named entities,
Context − ContentWords+NER. Context −
ContentWords+NER attempts to perform dimen-
sionality reduction and sparsity reduction by col-
lapsing named entities. The intuition is that if
we reduce the dimensions in semantically salient
ways we will not adversely affect performance.
We employ BBN’s IdentiFinder Named Entity
Recognition (NER) System2. The NER system re-
duces all proper names, months, days, dates and
times to NE tags. NER tagging is done on the cor-
pus before the context vectors are extracted. For
our purposes, it is not important that John kicked
the bucket on Friday in New York City – neither
the specific actor of the action, nor the place where
is occurs is of relevance. The sentence PERSON
kicked the bucket on DAY in PLACE conveys the
same amount of information. IdentiFinder identi-
fies 24 NE types. We deem 5 of these inaccurate
based on our observation, and exclude them. We
retain 19 NE types: Animal, Contact Information,
Disease, Event, Facility, Game, Language, Loca-
tion (merged with Geo-political Entity), Nation-
ality, Organization, Person, Product, Date, Time,
Quantity, Cardinal, Money, Ordinal and Percent-
age. The written-text portion of the BNC contains
6.4M named entities in 5M sentences (at least one
NE per sentence). The average number of words
per NE is 2.56, the average number of words per
sentence is 18.36. Thus, we estimate that by us-
ing NER, we reduce vector dimensionality by at
least 14% without introducing the negative effects
of sparsity.
V-N Combination In order to create a single
vector from the units of a VNC expression, we
need to combine the vectors pertaining to the verb
</bodyText>

type (V) and the noun type (N). After combin-
ing the word types in the vector dimensions, we
need to handle their co-occurrence frequency val-
ues. Hence we have two methods: addition where
we simply add the frequencies in the cases of
the shared dimensions which amounts to a union
where the co-occurrence frequencies are added;
or multiplication which amounts to an inter-
section of the vector dimensions where the co-
occurrence frequencies are multiplied, hence giv-
ing more weight to the shared dimensions than in
the addition case. In a study by (Mitchell and La-
pata, 2008) on a sentence similarity task, a multi-
plicative combination model performs better than
the additive one.
Similarity Measures We experiment with sev-
eral standard similarity measures: Cosine Similar-
ity, Overlap similarity, Dice Coefficient and Jac-
card Index as defined in (Manning and Sch¨utze,
1999). A context vector is converted to a set by
using the dimensions of the vector as members of
the set.

<bodyText confidence="0.999769217391304">
We use the British National Corpus (BNC),3
which contains 100M words, because it draws its
text from a wide variety of domains and the ex-
isting gold standard data sets are derived from it.
The BNC contains multiple genres including writ-
ten text and transcribed speech. We only experi-
ment with the written-text portion. We syntacti-
cally parse the corpus with the Minipar4 parser in
order to identify all VNC expression tokens in the
corpus. We exploit the lemmatized version of the
text in order to reduce dimensionality and sparse-
ness. The standard data used in (Cook et al., 2007)
(henceforth CFS07) is derived from a set compris-
ing 2920 unique VNC-Token expressions drawn
from the whole BNC. In this set, VNC token ex-
pressions are manually annotated as idiomatic, lit-
eral or unknown.
For our purposes, we discard 127 of the 2920
token gold standard data set either because they
are derived from the speech transcription por-
tion of the BNC, or because Minipar could not
parse them. Similar to the CFS07 set, we ex-

tors. Therefore, our resulting data set comprises
1125 VNC token expressions (CFS07 has 1180).
We then split them into a development (DEV) set
and a test (TEST) set. The DEV set comprises
564 token expressions corresponding to 346 id-
iomatic (IDM) expressions and 218 literal (LIT)
ones (CFS07 dev has 573). The TEST set com-
prises 561 token expressions corresponding to 356
IDM expression tokens and 205 LIT ones (CFS07

between our DEV and CFS07’s dev set and our
TEST and CFS07’s test set. They each comprise
14 VNC type expressions with no overlap in type
between the TEST and DEV sets. We divide the
tokens between the DEV and TEST maintaining
the same proportions of IDM to LIT as recom-
mended in CFS07: DEV is 61.5% and TEST is

together, illustrating the same trends in perfor-

As shown in Table 2, we obtain the best classifi-
cation accuracy of 75.54% (R-A-NE-B) on TEST
using the Overlap similarity measure, with Fβ=1
values for the IDM and LIT classes being 0.82
and 0.64, respectively. These results are generally
comparable to state-of-the-art results obtained by
CFS07 who report an overall system accuracy of
72.4% on their test set. Hence, we improve over
state-of-the-art results by 3% absolute.
In the DEV set, the highest results (F-measures
for IDM and LIT, as well as accuracy scores) are
obtained for all conditions consistently using the
Overlap similarity measure. We also note that our
approach tends to fare better overall in classifying
IDM than LIT. The best performance is obtained
in experimental setting R-A-NE-B at 78.53% ac-
curacy corresponding to an IDM classification F-
measure of 0.83 and LIT classification F-measure
of 0.71.
In the TEST set, we note that Overlap simi-
larity yields the highest overall results, however
inconsistently across all the experimental condi-
tions. The highest scores are yielded by the same
experimental condition R-A-NE-B. In fact, com-
parable to previous work, the Cosine similarity
measure significantly outperforms the other sim-
ilarity measures when the Dimension parameter is
set to no threshold (nT) and with a set threshold on
frequency (F). However, Cosine is outperformed
by Overlap when we apply a threshold to the Ratio
Dimension. It is worth noting that across all exper-
imental conditions (except in one case, nT-A-W-
N using Overlap similarity), IDM F-measures are
consistently higher than LIT F-measures, suggest-
ing that our approach is more reliable in detecting
idiomatic VNC MWE rather than not.
The overall results strongly suggest that us-
ing intelligent dimensionality reduction, such as
a threshold on the ratio, significantly outperforms
no thresholding (nT) and simple frequency thresh-
olding (F) comparing across different similarity
measures and all experimental conditions. Recall
that R was employed to maintain the salient sig-
nals in the context and exclude those that are irrel-
evant.

The results suggest some interaction between
the vector combination method, A or M, and the
Dimensionality pruning parameters. Experimen-
tal conditions that apply the multiplicative compo-
sitionality on the component vectors V and N yield
higher results in the nT and F conditions across all
the similarity measures. Yet once we apply R di-
mensionality pruning, we see that the additive vec-
tor combination, A parameter setting, yields bet-
ter results. This indicated that the M condition
already prunes too much in addition to the R di-
mensionality hence leading to slightly lower per-
formance.
For both DEV and TEST, we note that the R pa-
rameter settings coupled with the A parameter set-
ting. For DEV, we observe that the results yielded
from the Broad context extent, contextual sentence
and surrounding paragraph, yield higher results
than those obtained from the narrow N, context
sentence only, across M and A conditions. This
trend is not consistent with the results on the TEST
data set. R-A-W-N, outperforms R-A-W-B, how-
ever, R-M-W-B outperforms R-M-W-N.
We would like to point out that R-M-W-N has
very low values for the LIT F-measure, this is at-
tributed to the use of a unified R threshold value
of 175. We experimented with different optimal
thresholds for R depending on the parameter set-
ting combination and we discovered that for R-
M-W-N, the fine-tuned optimal threshold should
have been 27 as tuned on the DEV set, yielding
LIT F-measures of 0.68 and 0.63, for DEV and
TEST, respectively. Hence when using the uni-
fied value of 175, more of the compositional vec-
tors components of V+N are pruned away leading
to similarity values between the V+N vector and
the VNC vector of 0 (across all similarity mea-
sures). Accordingly, most of the expressions are

mis-classified as IDM.
The best results overall are yielded from the NE
conditions. This result strongly suggests that using
class based linguistic information and novel ways
to keep the relevant tokens in the vectors such as
R yields better MWE classification.
Qualitatively, we note the best results are ob-
tained on the following VNCs from the TEST
set in the Overlap similarity measure for the R-
A-W-B experimental setting (percentage of to-
kens classified correctly): make hay(94%), make
mark(88%), pull punch (86%), have word(81%),
blow whistle (80%), hit wall (79%), hold fire
(73%). While we note the highest performance
on the following VNCs in the corresponding R-A-
NE-B experimental setting: make hay(88%), make
mark(87%), pull punch (91%), have word(85%),
blow whistle (84%), hold fire (82%). We observe
that both conditions performed the worse on to-
kens from the following VNCs lose thread, make
hit. Especially, make hit is problematic since it
mostly a literal expression, yet in the gold stan-
dard set we see it marked inconsistently. For in-
stance, the literal sentence He bowled it himself
and Wilfred Rhodes made the winning hit while
the following annotates make hit as idiomatic: It
was the TV show Saturday Night Live which orig-
inally made Martin a huge hit in the States.
We also note the difference in performance in
the hard cases of VNCs that are relatively trans-
parent, only the R-A-W-B and R-A-NE-B exper-
imental conditions were able to classify them cor-
rectly with high F-measures as either IDM or LIT,
namely: have word, hit wall, make mark. For R-
A-W-B, the yielded accuracies are 81%, 79% and
88% respectively, and for R-A-NE-B, the accura-
cies are 85%, 65%, and 87%, respectively. How-
ever, in the nT-A-W-N condition have word is
classified incorrectly 82% of the time and in F-A-
W-N it is classified incorrectly 85% of the time.
Make mark is classified incorrectly 77% of the
time, make hay (77%) and hit wall (57%) in the
F-A-W-N experimental setting. This may be at-
tributed to the use of the Broader context, or the
use of R in the other more accurate experimental
settings.

<bodyText confidence="0.999873294117647">
In this study, we explored a set of features that
contribute to VNC token expression binary clas-
sification. We applied dimensionality reduction
heuristics inspired by information retrieval (tf-idf
like ratio measure) and linguistics (named-entity
recogniiton). These contributions improve signif-
icantly over experimental conditions that do not
manipulate context and dimensions. Our system
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a set that
is very close to a standard data set. Different from
previous studies, we classify VNC token expres-
sions in context. We include function words in
modeling the VNC token contexts as well as using
the whole paragraph in which it occurs as context.
Moreover we empirically show that the Overlap
similarity measure is a better measure to use for
MWE classification.

We focus our study on Verb-Noun Constructions (VNC) that vary in their idiomaticity depending on context. VNC tokens are classified as either idiomatic or literal. Our approach hinges upon the assumption that a literal VNC will more common its component words than an idiomatic one. Commonality is measured by contextual overlap. To this end, we set out to explore different contextual variations and different similarity measures handling the sparsity in the possible contexts via four different parameter variations. Our approach yields state of the art performance with an overall accuracy of 75.54% on a TEST data set.</abstract>

MWEs are pervasive in natural language, especially in web based texts and speech genres. Identifying MWEs and understanding their meaning is essential to language understanding, hence they are of crucial importance for any Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications that aim at handling robust language meaning and use. To date, most research has addressed the problem of MWE type classification for VNC expressions in English (Melamed, 1997; Lin, 1999; Baldwin et al., 2003; na Villada Moir´on and Tiedemann, 2006; Fazly and Stevenson, 2007; Van de Cruys and Villada Moir´on, 2007; McCarthy et al., 2007), not token classification. For example: he spilt the beans over the kitchen counter is most likely a literal usage. This is given away by the use of the prepositional phrase over the kitchen counter, since it is plausable that beans could have literally been spilt on a location such as a kitchen counter. Most previous research would classify spilt the beans as idiomatic irrespective of usage. A recent study by (Cook et al., 2008) of 60 idiom MWE types concluded th</context>

Semi-idiomatic: This class includes expressions that seem semantically non-compositional, yet their semantics are more or less transparent. This category consists of Light Verb Constructions (LVC) such as make a living and Verb Particle Constructions (VPC) such as write-up, call-up. Non-Idiomatic: This category includes expressions that are semantically compositional such as prime minister, proper nouns such as New York Yankees. 3 Previous Related Work Several researchers have addressed the problem of MWE classification (Baldwin et al., 2003; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Schone and Juraksfy, 2001; Hashimoto et al., 2006; Hashimoto and Kawahara, 2008).

In this paper, we address the problem of MWE classification for verb-noun (VNC) token constructions in running text. We investigate the binary classification of an unseen VNC token expression as being either Idiomatic (IDM) or Literal (LIT). An IDM expression is certainly an MWE, however, the converse is not necessarily true. We handle the problem of sparsity for MWE classification by exploring different vector space features: various vector similarity metrics, and more linguistically oriented feature sets. We evaluate our results against a standard data set from the study by (Cook et al., 2007). We achieve state of the art performance in classifying VNC tokens as either literal (F-measure: Fβ1=0.64) or idiomatic (Fβ1=0.82), corresponding to an overall accuracy of 75.54%.

On the other hand, (Cook et al., 2007) develop an unsupervised technique that classifies a VNC expression as idiomatic or literal. They examine if the similarity between the context vector of the MWE, in this case the VNC, and that of its idiomatic usage is higher than the similarity between its context vector and that of its literal usage. They define the vector dimensions in terms of the co-occurrence frequencies of 1000 most frequent content bearing words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and determiners) in the corpus.

Moreover, our definition of context includes all nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs occurring in the same paragraph as t. This broader notion of context should help reduce sparseness effects, simply by enriching the vector with more contextual information. Further, we realize the importance of some closed class words occurring in the vicinity of t. (Cook et al., 2007) report the importance of determiners in identifying idiomaticity. Prepositions too should be informative of idiomaticity (or literal usage) as illustrated above in spill the beans on the kitchen counter. Hence, we include determiners and prepositions occurring in the same sentence as t. The composed V-N contextual vector combines the co-occurrence of the verb type (aggregation of all the verb token instances in the whole corpus) as well as the noun type with this predefined set of dimensions.

The BNC contains multiple genres including written text and transcribed speech. We only experiment with the written-text portion. We syntactically parse the corpus with the Minipar4 parser in order to identify all VNC expression tokens in the corpus. We exploit the lemmatized version of the text in order to reduce dimensionality and sparseness. The standard data used in (Cook et al., 2007) (henceforth CFS07) is derived from a set comprising 2920 unique VNC-Token expressions drawn from the whole BNC. In this set, VNC token expressions are manually annotated as idiomatic, literal or unknown. For our purposes, we discard 127 of the 2920 token gold standard data set either because they are derived from the speech transcription portion of the BNC, or because Minipar could not parse them. Similar to the CFS07 set, we exclude expressions labeled unknown or pertaining 3http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/ 4http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/ lindek/minipar.htm 99 to the skewed data set as deemed by the</context>

On the other hand, (Cook et al., 2007) develop an unsupervised technique that classifies a VNC expression as idiomatic or literal. They examine if the similarity between the context vector of the MWE, in this case the VNC, and that of its idiomatic usage is higher than the similarity between its context vector and that of its literal usage. They define the vector dimensions in terms of the co-occurrence frequencies of 1000 most frequent content bearing words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and determiners) in the corpus. A context vector for a VNC expression is defined in terms of the wor</context>

Further, they report that a classifier that predicts the idiomatic label if an expression (token) occurs in a canonical form achieves an accuracy of 53.4% on the former data set (where the majority of the MWEs occur in their literal sense) and 84.7% on the latter data set (where the majority of the MWE instances are idiomatic). This indicates that these ‘canonical’ forms can still be used literally. They report an overall system performance accuracy of 72.4%.1 (Fazly and Stevenson, 2007) correlate compositionality with idiomaticity. They measure compositionality as a combination of two similarity values: firstly, similar to (Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006), the similarity (cosine similarity) between the context of a VNC and the contexts of its constituent words; secondly, the similarity between an expression’s context and that of a verb that is morphologically related to the noun in the expression, for instance, decide for make a decision. Context context(t) of an expression or a word, t, is defined as a vector of the frequencies of nouns cooccurring with t within a window of ±5 w</context>

However their results are not comparable to ours since it is type-based study. 1We note that the use of accuracy as a measure for this work is not the most appropriate since accuracy is a measure of error rather than correctness, hence we report F-measure in addition to accuracy. 97 4 Our Approach Recognizing the significance of contextual information in MWE token classification, we explore the space of contextual modeling for the task of classifying the token instances of VNC expressions into literal versus idiomatic expressions. Inspired by works of (Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Fazly and Stevenson, 2007), our approach is to compare the context vector of a VNC with the composed vector of the verb and noun (V-N) component units of the VNC when they occur in isolation of each other (i.e., not as a VNC). For example, in the case of the MWE kick the bucket, we compare the contexts of the instances of the VNC kick the bucket against the combined contexts for the verb (V) kick, independent of the noun bucket, and the contexts for the noun (N) bucket, independent of the verb kick. The intuition is that if there is a high similarity between the VNC and the combined V and N (namely, the V-N vector) con</context>

After combining the word types in the vector dimensions, we need to handle their co-occurrence frequency values. Hence we have two methods: addition where we simply add the frequencies in the cases of the shared dimensions which amounts to a union where the co-occurrence frequencies are added; or multiplication which amounts to an intersection of the vector dimensions where the cooccurrence frequencies are multiplied, hence giving more weight to the shared dimensions than in the addition case. In a study by (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) on a sentence similarity task, a multiplicative combination model performs better than the additive one. Similarity Measures We experiment with several standard similarity measures: Cosine Similarity, Overlap similarity, Dice Coefficient and Jaccard Index as defined in (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999). A context vector is converted to a set by using the dimensions of the vector as members of the set. 5 Experiments and Results 5.1 Data We use the British National Corpus (BNC),3 which contains 100M words, because it draws its text from a wide variety of domains and the existing gold standard data s</context>
