Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.986955074074074">
We are pleased to bring you these Proceedings of the First Workshop on Speech and Language
Processing for Assistive Technologies (SLPAT), held in Los Angeles, California, USA on June 5, 2010.
We received 16 paper submissions, of which 8 were chosen for oral presentation and another 4 for
poster presentation – all 12 papers are included in this volume. In addition, four demo proposals were
accepted, and short abstracts of these demos are also included here.
This workshop was intended to bring together individuals from the Augmentative and Alternative
Communication (AAC), Assistive Technologies (AT), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech
research communities, along with representatives from the AAC user community and companies
working in this domain, to share research findings, and to discuss present and future challenges and the
potential for collaboration and progress. While AAC is a particularly apt application area for speech and
NLP technologies, we purposefully made the scope of the workshop broad enough to include assistive
technologies as a whole, even those falling outside of AAC. While we encouraged work that validates
methods with human experimental trials, we also accepted work on basic-level innovations, inspired
by AT/AAC related problems. Thus we have aimed at broad inclusivity, which is also manifest in the
diversity of our Program Committee.
We are very excited to have three invited speakers. Rick Hohn and Jan Staehely will speak on their
experiences and perspectives as users of AAC technology. Also, Greg Lesher will give an invited talk
entitled “Exploiting Web Content for Augmentative Communication”. We would like to thank all three
for taking the time to participate and provide their collective insight to the workshop.
We would also like to thank the members of the Program Committee for completing their reviews
promptly, and for providing useful feedback for deciding on the program and preparing the final
versions of the papers. Thanks also to Priscilla Rasmussen, David Traum and Richard Sproat for
assistance with logistics. Finally, thanks to the authors of the papers, for submitting such interesting
and diverse work, and to the presenters of demos and commercial exhibitions.
