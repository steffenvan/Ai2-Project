We introduce NaturalOWL, an open-source multilin-
gual natural language generator that produces de-
scriptions of instances and classes, starting from a
linguistically annotated ontology. The generator is
heavily based on ideas from ILEX and M-PIRO, but
it is in many ways simpler and it provides full sup-
port for OWL DL ontologies with RDF linguistic an-
notations. NaturalOWL is written in Java, and it is
supported by M-PIRO’s authoring tool, as well as an
alternative plug-in for the Prot´eg´e ontology editor.

In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted
to the Semantic Web (Antoniou and van Harmelen,
2004), which can be thought of as an attempt to es-
tablish mechanisms that will allow computer appli-
cations to reason more easily about the semantics of
the Web’s resources (documents, services, etc.). Do-
main ontologies play a central role in this endeavour:
in effect, they establish domain-dependent semantic
vocabularies (classes of entities; particular entities,
called instances; properties of instances; axioms gov-
erning their use) that can be used to publish on the
Web knowledge in shared machine-readable repre-
sentations, and to annotate other resources (e.g.,
documents, videos) with machine-readable meta-
data describing aspects of their semantics.
In the case of natural language documents, some
semantic annotations can be produced automat-
ically via ontology-aware information extraction
(Bontcheva and Cunningham, 2003); but infor-
mation extraction can currently provide reliably
only relatively simple types of semantic informa-
tion, mostly by identifying and classifying named
entities, and, less reliably, relations between them.
When texts are generated automatically from for-
mal knowledge bases, however, the generator can
easily annotate the texts with much richer informa-
tion, including full representations of their seman-
tics, expressed in machine-readable markup. In fact,
an entire strand of work in natural language gener-
ation (NLG) has focused on generating textual de-
scriptions of an ontology’s classes or instances. A
well-known example of such work is ILEX (O’Donnell
et al., 2001), which was demonstrated mostly with
ontologies of museum exhibits. More recently, the
M-PIRO project (Androutsopoulos et al., 2007) de-
veloped a multilingual extension of ILEX, which was
tested in several domains, including museum ex-
hibits and computing equipment. In this type of
work, the ontology’s role is no longer simply to pro-
vide a semantic vocabulary; the ontology acts as a
repository of knowledge, and parts of the knowledge
(e.g., information pertaining to particular instances
or classes) can be rendered automatically in multi-
ple natural languages or in a machine-readable form
that carries the same semantic content. For exam-
ple, M-PIRO’s generator can deliver a description like
the following to a human on-line shopper,
A110: This is a laptop, manufactured by Toshiba.
It has a Centrino Duo processor, 512 MB RAM,
and an 80 GB hard disk. Its speed is 1.7 GHz and
it costs 850 Euro.
and the following semantically equivalent formal rep-
resentation to a software agent.1 Alternatively, each
individual sentence of the text could be marked up
with a machine readable semantic representation.

The standard formalism for publishing ontologies
on the Semantic Web (sW) is currently OWL.2 There
are application domains (e.g., on-line shops) where
one can envisage future sW sites that will maintain
and publish their content entirely in the form of
OWL ontologies. Then, NLG technology, embedded
in server or browser plug-ins, could be used to ren-
der parts of the OWL ontologies in multiple natural

languages or equivalent machine-readable represen-
tations on demand (Androutsopoulos et al., 2007).
NLG can, thus, be seen as a key technology of the sW,
which makes knowledge accessible to both humans
and computers, a major target of the sW.
In this paper, we introduce NaturalOWL, a pro-
totype open-source natural language generator in-
tended to demonstrate what NLG can offer to the
sW.3will be announced in the final version of this pa-
per. NaturalOWL is heavily based on ideas from ILEX
and M-PIRO, but unlike its predecessors it provides
full support for OWL DL, the most principled version
of OWL that corresponds to description logic (Baader
et al., 2002); many NLG researchers will be familiar
with this form of logic. Our previous attempts to
support OWL in M-PIRO’s generator ran into prob-
lems, because of incompatibilities between OWL and
M-PIRO’s ontological model (Androutsopoulos et al.,
2005). Compared to ILEX and M-PIRO, NaturalOWL
is also simpler; for example, it is entirely template-
based, as opposed to the Systemic Grammars its
predecessors employed.4 Although future work may
enhance some of NaturalOWL’s components, the sim-
plicity of the current system makes it easier to ex-
plain to sW researchers, who may not be familiar
with NLG. It also simplifies the task of extending
the system to support additional natural languages.
NaturalOWL currently supports English and Greek.
It has been argued (Mellish and Sun, 2006) that
in most OWL ontologies, classes and properties are
given names that are either English words (e.g.,
Laptop, cost) or concatenations of English words
(e.g., manufacturedBy, hasMemory). Based on this
observation, Sun and Mellish (2006) generate texts
from RDF descriptions, RDF being the description
formalism on which OWL is based, without any
domain-dependent linguistic resources. They use
WordNet to tokenize the names of classes and prop-
erties, as well as to assign part-of-speech (POs) tags
to tokens, and this allows them to guess that a class
name like Laptop above is in fact a noun that can be
used to refer to that class, or that &lt;manufacturedBy
rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#toshiba&amp;quot; /&gt; should be expressed in
English as “[This laptop] was manufactured by
Toshiba”. Hewlett et al. (2005) adopt very sim-
ilar techniques. This approach, however, is prob-
lematic when texts have to be generated in multiple
languages. Even in the monolingual case, there are
significant problems: for example, a POs-tagger is
often needed to distinguish between noun and verb
uses of the same token, and morphological or even
syntactic analysis is needed (especially in highly in-
flected languages) to extract tokens from class and

property names and convert them into grammatical
phrases; in effect, this re-introduces the need to in-
terpret texts. Furthermore, our experience is that
generating high-quality texts often requires linguis-
tic information that is not present, not even indi-
rectly, in OWL ontologies, nor can it be embedded
conveniently in them (Androutsopoulos et al., 2005).
We, therefore, propose to annotate OWL ontolo-
gies with stand-off RDF markup that associates el-
ements of the ontologies (e.g., classes, properties)
with domain-dependent linguistic resources (e.g.,
lexicon entries, templates). We believe that this kind
of linguistic annotation should be a standard part of
ontology engineering for the sW; apart from allowing
parts of the ontology to be presented to end-users in
natural language, it facilitates presenting ontologies
to domain experts for validation; and the annota-
tions can also be useful when querying or extending
ontologies via natural language (Katz et al., 2002;
Bernstein and Kaufmann, 2006). NaturalOWL’s RDF
linguistic annotations will hopefully contribute to-
wards a discussion in the NLG community on how to
annotate OWL ontologies with linguistic information,
and this may eventually produce standards that will
allow alternative NLG components to render OWL on-
tologies in natural language, in the same way that al-
ternative browsers can be used to view HTML pages.
Below we present briefly NaturalOWL’s processing
stages and its annotations of OWL ontologies. Fol-
lowing Wilcock (2003), the processing stages com-
municate in XML, but they are implemented in Java,
instead of XsLT, and there is a clearer separation be-
tween processing code and linguistic resources.

2 Document planning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997566391304348">
When instructed to produce a natural language de-
scription of an instance, NaturalOWL first selects
from the ontology all the logical facts that are di-
rectly relevant to that instance; for example, when
describing the laptop of the first page, it would se-
lect the fact that the instance is a Laptop, the fact
that its manufacturer is Toshiba, etc.5 NaturalOWL
may be instructed to include facts that are further
away in a graph representation of the ontology, up
to a maximum (configurable) distance; setting the
distance to two when describing a statue, for exam-
ple, would also include in the selected facts informa-
tion about the statue’s sculptor (e.g., the country
and year they were born in). This is very similar
5To save space, we restrict the discussion to descriptions of
instances. NaturalOWL can also describe classes, but it con-
veys only information that is explicit in the ontology, unlike
the work of Mellish and Sun (2005), where class descriptions
also convey inferred facts. There are also separate stand-off
annotations that specify how interesting each type of fact is
per user type, and other user modelling information, much as
in ILEX and M-PIRO. The ordering annotations could also be
made sensitive to user type and target language.

to ILEX’s content selection, but without employing
rhetorical relations.
The selected facts of distance one are then ordered
by consulting ordering annotations (see owlnl:order
below), which specify a partial order of properties
(e.g., that the manufacturer should be mentioned
first, followed by the processor, memory and disk in
any order, and then the price); is-a facts are always
mentioned first. Second distance facts are always
placed right after the corresponding directly rele-
vant facts, producing texts like “This is a statue. It
was sculpted by Nikolaou, who was born in Athens
in 1968. This statue is made of marble and it... ”.
In the application domains we have considered, this
ordering scheme was adequate, although in other
domains more elaborate text planning approaches
may be needed; consult, for example, Bontcheva and
Wilks (2004) for an application of text schemata to
NLG from ontologies.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999705214285714">
For each property, one or more micro-plans need
to be specified per language. NaturalOWL’s micro-
plans are templates, each consisting of a se-
quence of slots. Each slot can be filled by an
expression referring to the owner of the prop-
erty (the laptop, in the case of manufacturedBy),
the value (filler) of the property (Toshiba), or
a string. The following RDF annotations re-
fer to the manufacturedBy property.6 After set-
ting the property’s order, they define an English
micro-plan, according to which &lt;manufacturedBy
rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#toshiba&amp;quot; /&gt; should be rendered in
English as a phrase starting with (first slot) a nom-
inative expression referring to the owner (the lap-
top). The owlnl:retype element of the first slot al-
lows the system to select automatically among using
the owner’s name in natural language (if it has one),
a noun phrase (e.g., “this laptop”), or a pronoun to
refer to the owner, depending on context. The sec-
ond slot will be filled by the string “was manufac-
tured”, which is marked up as being a past passive
verb form; this additional markup is needed when
aggregating phrases to form longer sentences. The
third and fourth slots will be filled by the string “by”
and an accusative automatically selected referring
expression corresponding to the filler, respectively.
The micro-plan may generate, for example, a phrase
like “It was manufactured by Toshiba”.7

NaturalOWL currently employs a very simple al-
gorithm for generating referring expressions: once
the instance being described has been introduced by
mentioning its class (e.g., “This is a statue.”), it
uses pronouns to refer to that instance (e.g., “It was
sculpted by Nikolaou.”), until the focus moves to an-
other instance (“Nikolaou was born in Athens. He
was born in 1968.”). Then, when the focus returns to
the original instance, a demonstrative is used (“This
statue is made of... ”). As in M-PIRO, some proper-
ties may contain canned strings, and there are spe-
cial annotations to flag canned strings that change
the focus. Again, more elaborate referring expres-
sion generation algorithms can be added.
To be able to generate expressions like “this is a
statue” or “this laptop”, NaturalOWL requires OWL
classes to be associated with noun phrases (more
precisely n-bars). This is illustrated in the RDF
statements below, where the class Laptop is associ-
ated with a noun phrase entry laptop-NP of Nat-
uralOWL’s domain-dependent multilingual lexicon,
also expressed in RDF. The lexicon entry lists the
various forms of the noun phrase, provides informa-
tion on gender etc. The nominative singular form
in Greek would be “cpopr-CoZ unoXoyic -Ct 1Z” (portable
computer). We have considered associating classes
with WordNet (or EuroWordNet) synsets, but the
domain ontologies we have experimented with con-
tain highly technical concepts, which are not cov-
ered by WordNet. Nevertheless, we plan to consider
emerging standards for linguistic annotations (Ide
and Romary, 2004), especially regarding the lexicon.
The phrases of the micro-plans are then aggre-
gated in longer sentences, using roughly M-PIRO’s

aggregation rules (Melengoglou, 2002). This pro-
duces the final text, and, hence, there is no separate
surface realization phase, apart from adding presen-
tation markup, markup for speech synthesizers etc.

NaturalOWL is supported by M-PIRO’s authoring tool
(Androutsopoulos et al., 2007), which has been ex-
tended by NCSR “Demokritos” to be compatible with
OWL DL. The tool helps “authors” port NaturalOWL
to new application domains, including the tasks of
ontology construction, defining micro-plans, creat-
ing the domain-dependent lexicon, etc. NaturalOWL
is also accompanied by a plug-in for Prot´eg´e, an
ontology editor most SW researchers are familiar
with.8 The plug-in provides the same functionality
as M-PIRO’s authoring tool. Consult also Bontcheva
(2004) for related work on authoring tools.

We introduced NaturalOWL, an open-source natu-

currently supports English and Greek. The system
is intended to demonstrate the benefits of adopting
NLG techniques in the Semantic Web, and to con-

It also simplifies the task of extending the system to support additional natural languages. NaturalOWL currently supports English and Greek. It has been argued (Mellish and Sun, 2006) that in most OWL ontologies, classes and properties are given name</context>

Furthermore, our experience is that generating high-quality texts often requires linguistic information that is not present, not even indirectly, in OWL ontologies, nor can it be embedded conveniently in them (Androutsopoulos et al., 2005). We, therefore, propose to annotate OWL ontologies with stand-off RDF markup that associates elements of the ontologies (e.g., classes, properties) with domain-dependent linguistic resources (e.g., lexicon entries, templates). We believe that this kind of linguistic annotation should be a standard part of ontology engineering for the sW; apart from allowing parts of the ontology to be presented to end-users in natural language, it facilitates presenting ontologies to domain experts for validation; and the annotations can also be useful when querying or extending ontologies via natural languag</context>

When texts are generated automatically from formal knowledge bases, however, the generator can easily annotate the texts with much richer information, including full representations of their semantics, expressed in machine-readable markup. In fact, an entire strand of work in natural language generation (NLG) has focused on generating textual descriptions of an ontology’s classes or instances. A well-known example of such work is ILEX (O’Donnell et al., 2001), which was demonstrated mostly with ontologies of museum exhibits. More recently, the M-PIRO project (Androutsopoulos et al., 2007) developed a multilingual extension of ILEX, which was tested in several domains, including museum exhibits and computing equipment. In this type of work, the ontology’s role is no longer simply to provide a semantic vocabulary; the ontology acts as a repository of knowledge, and parts of the knowledge (e.g., information pertaining to particular instances or classes) can be rendered automatically in multiple natural languages or in a machine-readable form that carries the same semantic content. For example, M-PIRO’s generator can deliver a description like the following to a human on-line shop</context>

In the case of natural language documents, some semantic annotations can be produced automatically via ontology-aware information extraction (Bontcheva and Cunningham, 2003); but information extraction can currently provide reliably only relatively simple types of semantic information, mostly by identifying and classifying named entities, and, less reliably, relations between them.

In the application domains we have considered, this ordering scheme was adequate, although in other domains more elaborate text planning approaches may be needed; consult, for example, Bontcheva and Wilks (2004) for an application of text schemata to NLG from ontologies. 3 Microplanning, surface realisation For each property, one or more micro-plans need to be specified per language. NaturalOWL’s microplans are templates, each consisting of a sequence of slots. Each slot can be filled by an expression referring to the owner of the property (the laptop, in the case of manufacturedBy), the value (filler) of the property (Toshiba), or a string. The following RDF annotations refer to the manufacturedBy property.6 After setting the property’s order, they define an English micro-plan, according to which &lt;m</context>

It also simplifies the task of extending the system to support additional natural languages. NaturalOWL currently supports English and Greek. It has been argued (Mellish and Sun, 2006) that in most OWL ontologies, classes and properties are given names that are either English words (e.g., Laptop, cost) or concatenations of English words (e.g., manufacturedBy, hasMemory). Based on this observation, Sun and Mellish (2006) generate texts from RDF descriptions, RDF being the description formalism on which OWL is based, without any domain-dependent linguistic resources. They use WordNet to tokenize the names of classes and properties, as well as to assign part-of-speech (POs) tags to tokens, and this allows them to guess that a class name like Laptop above is in fact a noun that can be used to refer to that class, or that &lt;manufacturedBy rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#toshiba&amp;quot; /&gt; should be expressed in English as “[This laptop] was manufactured by Toshiba”. Hewlett et al. (2005) adopt very similar techniques. This approach, howe</context>

NaturalOWL’s RDF linguistic annotations will hopefully contribute towards a discussion in the NLG community on how to annotate OWL ontologies with linguistic information, and this may eventually produce standards that will allow alternative NLG components to render OWL ontologies in natural language, in the same way that alternative browsers can be used to view HTML pages. Below we present briefly NaturalOWL’s processing stages and its annotations of OWL ontologies. Following Wilcock (2003), the processing stages communicate in XML, but they are implemented in Java, instead of XsLT, and there is a clearer separation between processing code and linguistic resources. 2 Document planning When instructed to produce a natural language description of an instance, NaturalOWL first selects from the ontology all the logical facts that are directly relevant to that instance; for example, when describing the laptop of the first page, it would select the fact that the instance is a Laptop, the fact that its manufacturer is Toshiba, etc.5 NaturalOWL may be instructed to include facts that ar</context>
