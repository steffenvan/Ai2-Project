Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999145625">
The automatic detection of emotions in texts and the generation of texts that express emotions is
important for applications such as natural language interfaces, e-learning environments, and educational
or entertainment games. These aspects are also important in opinion mining and sentiment analysis, and
in the larger area of affective computing.
This workshop provides a forum for discussion between leading names and researchers involved in
processing emotions in the context of natural language understanding, natural language generation, or
applications in which computational approaches to the processing of emotions are useful.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: emotion analysis in sentences and documents;
classification of texts by emotion and mood; the generation of sentences that express emotions; emotion
processing across different languages; the analysis of sentiment and opinion that contains emotional
aspects; argumentation that includes emotions and opinions; emotion analysis in automatic speech
transcripts; applications in which affective aspects are beneficial; other aspects of the computational
treatment of emotion and affect.
We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers for the hard work that went behind their
submissions. We express our deepest gratitude to the committee members for their thorough reviews.
We also thank the NAACL-HLT 2010 organizers for their help with administrative matters.
