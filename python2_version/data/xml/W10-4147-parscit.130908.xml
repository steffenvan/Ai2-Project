<bodyText confidence="0.999951555555556">
Parsing is one of key issues in natural language
processing, and its main task is to automatically
identify the syntactic structure of sentences (syn-
tactic units and their syntactic relations between
units). The study of parsing is of critical impor-
tance for machine translation, natural language
understanding, information extraction and auto-
matic summarization of natural language proc-
essing systems. Syntactic analysis methods in-
clude methods of use of corpus annotation in-
formation in syntactic analysis and the rule-
based methods such as: Shift-Reduce Parsing
and Chart Parsing technology to study the Chi-
nese syntactic structure[1]. In this paper, the
Chinese parser which China Electronic Informa-
tion Industry Development (CCID) uses to par-
ticipate in the 2th Evaluation on Chinese Parsing
is described.

The Chinese parser which CCID uses to
participate in the 2th Evaluation on Chinese
Parsing serves as a component of a practical
Chinese-English machine translation system,
and uses rule-based method, and uses statistical
approach for unknown word recognition. The
Chinese parser includes the following three
modules: 1) Chinese word segmenting, 2)
Chinese POS tagging, 3) Chinese parsing. The
form of rules in the Chinese parser is production
rule. The rules include general rules and specific
rules. The general rules are indexed by POS or
phrase types, and specific rules are indexed by
Chinese word or Chinese phrase. There are
multi-passes during Chinese parsing, and the
result of the parsing of a Chinese sentence is a
Chinese syntactic tree. The CCID’s Chinese
parser includes 1,930,000 entries in the basic
dictionaries and 6,000 rules in knowledge base.
Parts of speech and syntactic elements of the
output of the CCID’s Chinese parser are marked
by its own set of markup symbols, and these
markup symbols are mapped to parts of speech
tags and syntactic component tags defined by
CIPS-ParsEval-2009 by a conversion function.
The CCID’s tag set is mainly same as the set of
CIPS-ParsEval-2009 except the used tag
characters. For example, in the CCID’s tag set,
the tag of noun phrase is NP, and the tag of verb
phrase is VP, and the tag of preposition phrase is
IP; for the tags in CIPS-ParsEval-2009, the tag
of noun phrase is np, and the tag of verb phrase
is vp, and the tag of preposition phrase is pp.

CCID participated in the 2th Evaluation on Chi-
nese Parsing, and timely submitted parsing out-
put of test sentences of the syntactic analysis.
The Test Group returned to a very unfortunate
message: &amp;quot;find that the results presented in the
original segmentation of data are automatically
merged, so can not give the appropriate evalua-
tion of data.&amp;quot;
Here are two specific examples:

Reasons for these phenomena are: “显微解剖
学”、“光学显微镜”、“电子显微镜”、
“心动过速”、“心房颤动”、“心房扑
动”、“快速性心律失常”、“心电图监
护”and some other entries have already existed
as separate entries in the basic dictionaries of the
CCID’s Chinese parser. In parsing, these entries
act as separate entries and the results also show
up as separate entries. This occurs because of the
larger basic dictionary(1.93 million entries), and
these entries have the corresponding English
translations on the expression. For a practical
Chinese parser, a large number of phrases that
already exist in the basic vocabularies can re-
duce the burden of parsing, and are useful for
improving the success rate of Chinese syntactic
analysis. But this adds extra burden to evaluation
programs. When participating in the next Chi-
nese parsing evaluation, some phrases that have
existed in the basic dictionaries of Chinese
parser will be divided to further analyze their
internal syntactic structures to facilitate the
evaluation process.
After receiving the notice that a re-evaluation
can be done by the Evaluation Group to help
CCID to evaluate the effectiveness of the modi-
fication of the parsing model, the following steps
are carried out for the convenience of the evalua-
tion programs:

<listItem confidence="0.979353928571429">
1) Compare all words in the test task with
CCID’s Chinese parser, and find out the
information for the words from CCID’s
Chinese parser, and delete all other
words from the Chinese parser to avoid
the situation that some Chinese words
are combined when parsing.
2) Modify parsing rules that contain opera-
tions of deleting words to avoid the de-
letion of Chinese words in the parsing
results.
3) Re-parse Chinese sentences in the test
task.
4) Submit the result of the parsing to the

Chinese parsing is an important basic research
for Chinese information processing research, and
gets the attention of many researchers. Current
research focuses on the research on syntactic
knowledge acquisition based on the corpus, and
its goal is to use statistical methods from a good
tree bank annotation to learn the parsing needed
knowledge, and the trained parser also promotes
the work of automatic/semi-automatic annota-
tion to corpus. Statistical methods have an ad-
vantage for fine-grained knowledge of the lan-
guage than the rule method, and can automati-
cally learn knowledge from the annotated corpus,
and is attractive and worthy of research.
Meanwhile, many Chinese parsers that have
the background for the practical application use
the rule-based approach, and, in addition to the
accumulation of knowledge in the process of
manual knowledge acquisition, also use statisti-
cal methods to help get the phrases from the
corpus, and also include the translation equiva-
lents acquired automatically for machine transla-
tion. An important direction of development for
these systems is to find ways to learn a lot of
phrase knowledge from the corpus, which can
greatly reduce the difficulties encountered in the
ambiguity resolution to improve the accuracy of
syntactic analysis. For Chinese-English machine
translation system, the difficulty will be signifi-
cantly lower after adding a large number of
phrases and their translation to the system, and
as a result, some syntactic structure ambiguities
are eliminated, and many phrases are translated
as a whole and the readability of the translation
also are improved.
An important development trend of natural
language processing is that corpus is considered
as processing objects and sources of knowledge
acquisition. Rule approach has proven to be dif-
ficult to the task of processing large-scale real
corpus, so the researchers turn to the help of sta-
tistical methods, and many experiments prove
that statistical methods indeed have made great
progress. But the statistical method has its inher-
ent shortcomings, and statistical methods alone
can hardly reach expectations of the perfect goal
of natural language processing. Thus, Many re-
searchers begin to explore ways of combination
of statistical methods and rules, and have made
some progress, but there is still a long way to go
from the ultimate goal of natural language proc-
essing (computer can fully understand the nature
of human language). The current trend of inte-
gration of empiricism and rationalism in natural
language processing is a significant phenomenon,
and its development will produce a lot of valu-
able results, and natural language processing
research and applications will benefit from it.
The CCID’s future research will focus on
methods of automatically extracting knowledge
of Chinese phrases and their translations. These
methods will be mainly statistical methods,
combining with some of the rules means to fa-
cilitate access to single-language knowledge and
improve the correct translation rate. Progress of
the research in this regard will be helpful for our
practical machine translation system to improve
the quality of translation. At the same time, it
has a direct role in improving the quality of Chi-
nese parser.

ence Foundation of China, and the project num-
