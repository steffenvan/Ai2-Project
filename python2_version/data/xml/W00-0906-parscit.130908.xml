<bodyText confidence="0.999929444444444">
This article investigates (a) whether register
discrimination can successfully exploit linguistic
information reflecting the evolution of a
language (such as the diglossia phenomenon of
the Modern Greek language) and (b) what kind
of linguistic information and which statistical
techniques may be employed to distinguish
among individual styles within one register.
Using clustering techniques and features
reflecting the diglossia phenomenon, we have
successfully discriminated registers in Modern
Greek. However, diglossia information has not
been shown sufficient to distinguish among
individual styles within one register. Instead, a
large number of linguistic features need to be
studied with methods such as discriminant
analysis in order to obtain a high degree of
discrimination accuracy.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984836363637">
The identification of the language style
characterising the constituent parts of a corpus is
very important to several applications. For
example, in information retrieval applications,
where large corpora of texts need to be searched
efficiently, it is useful to have information about
the language style used in each text, to improve
the accuracy of the search (Karlgren, 1999). In
fact, the criteria regarding language style may
differ for each search and therefore — due to the
large number of texts — there is a requirement to
perform style categorisation in an automated
manner. Such systems normally use statistical
methods to evaluate the properties of given texts.
The complexity of the studied properties varies.
Kilgarriff (1996) employs mainly the frequency-
of-occurrence of words while Karlgren (1999)
applies statistical methods primarily on structural
and part-of-speech information.
Baayen et al. (1996), who study the topic of
author identification, apply statistical measures
and methods on syntactic rewrite rules resulting
by processing a given set of texts. They report
that the accuracy thus obtained is higher than
when applying the same statistical measures to
the original text. On the other hand, Biber
(1995) uses Multidimensional Analysis coupled
with a large number of linguistic features to
distinguish among registers. The underlying idea
is that, rather than being distinguished on the
basis of a set of linguistic features, registers are
distinguished on the basis of combinations of
weighted linguistic features, the so-called
&amp;quot;dimensions&amp;quot;.
This article reports on the discrimination of texts
in written Modern Greek. The ongoing research
described here has followed two distinct
directions. First, we have tried to distinguish
among registers of written Modem Greek. In a
second phase, our research has focused on
distinguishing among individual styles within
one register and, more specifically, among
speakers of the Greek Parliament. To achieve
that, structural, morphological and part-of-speech
information is employed. Initially (in section 2)
emphasis is placed on distinguishing among the
different registers used. In section 3, the task of
author identification is tested with selected
statistical methods. In both sections, we describe
the set of linguistic features measured, we argue
for the statistical method employed and we
comment on the results. Section 4 contains a
description of future plans for extending this line
of research while in section 5 the conclusions of
this article are provided.

2 Distinguishing Registers
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999804">
To distinguish among registers, we successfully
exploited a particular feature of Modern Greek,
namely the contrast between Katharevousa and
Demotiki. These are variations of Modern Greek
which correspond (if only roughly) to formal and
informal speaking. Katharevousa was the official
language of the Greek State until 1979 when it
was replaced by Demotiki. By that time,
Demotiki was the established language of
literature while, in times, it had been the
language of elementary education. Compared to
Demotiki, Katharevousa bears an important
resemblance to Ancient Greek manifested
explicitly on the morphological level and the use
of the lexicon. At a second step, we dropped the
Katharevousa-Demotiki approach and relied on
part-of-speech information, which is often
exploited in text categorisation experiments (for
instance, see Biber et al. 1998). Again, we
obtained satisfactory results.

2.1 Method of work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999807">
The variables used to distinguish among registers
may be grouped into the following categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.916307">
1. Morphological variables: These were verbal
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993896333333333">
endings quantifying the contrast
Katharevousa / Demotiki. Although the
morphological differences between these two
variations of Greek are not limited to the
verb paradigm, we focused on the latter since
it better highlights the contrast under
consideration (Tambouratzis et al., 2000). A
total of 230 verbal endings were selected,
split into 145 Demotiki and 85 Katharevousa
endings (see also the Appendix). These 230
frequencies-of-occurrence were grouped into
12 variables for use in the statistical analysis.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.974837666666667">
2. Lexical variables: Certain negation particles
(ovoeic, ovoirore, ovoquoti, civet)) clearly
signify a preference for Katharevousa while
others (5ixcoc, p4re, xcopig) are clear
indicators of Demotiki. However, the most
frequently used negation particles (oxt, lam
5ev) are not characteristic of either of the two
variations.
3. Structural macro-features: average sentence
length, number of commas, dashes and
brackets (total of 4 variables).
4. After the completion of the experiments with
variables of type 1-3 (Tambouratzis et al.,
2000), Part-of-Speech (PoS) counts were
introduced. The PoS categories were
adjectives, adjunctions, adverbs, articles,
conjunctions, nouns, pronouns, numerals,
particles, verbs and a hold-all category (for
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983640772727273">
non-classifiable entries), resulting in 11
variables expressed as percentages.
These variables are more similar to the
characteristics used by Karlgren (1999), and
differ considerably from those used by Kilgarriff
(1996) and Baayen et al. (1996). For the metrics
of the first and third categories, a custom-built
program was used running under Linux. This
program calculated all structural and
morphological metrics for each text in a single
pass and the results were processed with the help
of a spreadsheet package. The metrics of the
second category were calculated using a custom-
built program in the C programming language.
PoS counts were obtained using the ILSP tagger
(Papageorgiou et al., 2000) coupled with a
number of custom-built programs to determine
the actual frequencies-of-occurrence from the
tagged texts. Finally, the STATGRAPHICS
package was used for the statistical analysis.
The dataset selected consisted of examples from
three registers:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981101375">
(i) fiction (364 Kwords -24 texts),
(ii) texts of academic prose referring to
historical issues, also referred to as the
history register (361 Kwords —32 texts) and
(iii) political speeches obtained from the
proceedings of the Greek parliament
sessions, also referred to as the parliament
register (509 Kwords — 12 texts).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937590909091">
The texts of registers (I) and (II) were retrieved
from the ILSP corpus (Gavrilidou et at., 1998),
all of them dating from the period 1991-1999.
The texts of register (III) were transcripts of the
Greek Parliament sessions held during the first
half of 1999.
This dataset was processed using both seeded
and unseeded clustering techniques with between
3 and 6 clusters. The unseeded approach
confirmed the existence of distinct natural
classes, which correspond to the three registers.
The seeded approach confirmed the ability to
accurately separate these three registers and to
cluster their elements together. Initially, a &apos;short&apos;
data vector containing only the 12 morphological
variables quantifying the Demotiki/Katharevousa
contrast was used (Tambouratzis et al. 2000), as
well as a 16-element vector combining structural
and morphological characteristics. The seeds for
the Parliament and History registers were chosen
randomly. The seeds for the Fiction register were
chosen so that at least one of them would not be

Representative results are shown in Table 1 for
the different vectors and numbers of clusters. In
each case, the classification rate quoted
corresponds to the number of text elements
correctly classified (according to the register of
the respective seed).

The vector size was augmented with PoS
information, resulting in a 27-element data
vector. A new set of clustering experiments were
performed using Ward&apos;s method with the
squared Euclidean distance measure to cluster
the data in an unseeded manner. Finally, a 15-

structural information but without any
morphological information. The results obtained
(Table 2) show that PoS information improves
the clustering performance.

2.2 Comments on the Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990425531915">
Our results strongly suggest that registers of
written Modern Greek can be discriminated
accurately on the basis of the contrast
Katharevousa / Demotild manifested with
morphological variation. Languages with a
different history may not be suited to such a
categorisation method. This is evident in Biber&apos;s
work (1995) for the English language, where a
variety of grammatical and macro-structural
linguistic features but no morphological variation
features were employed. It seems then that
corpora of languages which are characterised by
the phenomenon of diglossia, may be
successfully categorisable on the basis of
morphological information (or other reflexes of
diglossia). Such a discrimination method may
give results as satisfactory as approaches which
are closer to the Biber (1995) spirit and rely on
PoS and structural measures (see Tables 1 and
2).
Tables 1 and 2 show that the accuracy of
clustering reaches approximately 99% while the
seeded clustering approach had a high degree of
accuracy, reaching 100% when using 5 clusters.
For the 27-element vector with both
morphological and PoS information, perfect
clustering has been achieved even with 4
clusters. On the other hand, a successful
clustering (albeit with a lower level of accuracy)
is achieved using only structural and PoS
information.
It should be noted that the lexical variables used,
that is the negation particles, did not contribute at
all (Marlcantonatou et at., 2000). Furthermore,
the system performed almost as well with and
without macro-structure features, the difference
in accuracy being less than 5%.
The parliament texts can be claimed to form a
register whose patterns are closely positioned in
the pattern space. Of the three registers, the
literature one presented the highest degree of
variance, with more than one sub-clusters
existing as well as oudier elements. This may be
explained by the fact that the parliament
proceedings, contrary to literature, undergo
intensive editing by a small group of specialised
public servants.

In this section, we report on our efforts to
distinguish among individual styles within one
register. In particular, we intend to distinguish
among speakers of the Parliament by studying
the transcripts of the speeches of five parliament
members over the period 1997-2000. Each of
these speakers belongs to one of the five political
parties that were represented in the Greek
parliament over that period. Up to date, the

etc. (resulting in a total of 2 variables).
6. The identity of the speaker, denoted as the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99740001754386">
speaker Signature (1 variable), which was
used to determine the desired classification.
Similarly to the clustering experiments, a set of
C programs was used to extract automatically the
values of the aforementioned variables from the
transcripts. Most of these programs rely on
measuring the occurrence of di-grams, and more
generally n-grams, for letters, words and tagsets,
thus being straight-forward. In the case of
speaker identification, Discriminant Analysis
was used, as the clustering approach did not give
very good results, indicating that the distinction
among personal styles is weaker than that among
registers. Even when only 2 speakers were used,
the clusters formed involved patterns from both
speaker classes.
We experimented with two corpora, Corpus I and
Corpus II, as described in Table 3. Corpus 11 is a
subset of Corpus L Each of the speeches
included in Corpus U was delivered as an
opening speech (&amp;quot;protoloyia&amp;quot;) at a parliament
session when at least two of the studied speakers
delivered speeches.
An important issue is whether the selected
variables are strongly correlated. If indeed strong
correlations do exist, these might be used to
reduce the dimensionality of the pattern space.
For the purposes of this analysis, the 46
independent variables were used (45 in the case
of Corpus II where only &amp;quot;protoloyiai&amp;quot; exist, since
then the order variable is constantly equal to 1).
The number of correlations of all variable pairs
exceeding given thresholds is depicted in Figure
1, for both Corpus I and Corpus II. According
to this study, in Corpus IL the percentage of
variable pairs with an absolute value of
correlation exceeding 0.5 is approximately 3%,
indicating a low correlation between the
parameters. Additionally, out of 990 pairs of
Corpus II, only a single one has a correlation
exceeding 0.8. The correlations for the same
parameter pairs over the two corpora are similar,
though as a rule the correlation for Corpus I is
less that that for Corpus IL reflecting the larger
variability of texts in Corpus L The correlation
study indicated that most of the parameters are
not strongly correlated. Thus, a factor analysis
step is not necessary and the application of the
discriminant analysis directly on the original
variables is justified.
Initially, Corpus I (see Table 3) was processed.
The 46 aforementioned variables were used to
generate discriminant functions accurately
recognising the identity of the speaker. To that
end, three different approaches were used:
(i) the full model: all variables were used to
determine the discriminant functions;
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.994214833333333">
(ii) the forward model: starting from an
empty model, variables were introduced in
order to create a reduced model, with a
small number of variables;
(iii) the backward model: starting from the full
model, variables were eliminated to create
a reduced model.
In the cases of the forward and backward
models, the values of the F parameter to both
enter and delete a variable were set to 4 while the
maximum number of steps to generate the model
was set to 50.

3.2 Comments on the Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984673509090909">
Though this research is continuing, certain facts
can be reported with confidence.
Within the Greek Parliament Proceedings
register, individual styles can not be classified on
the basis of morphological features expressing
the contrast Katharevousa/Demotilci. This may
be explained by the fact that these texts undergo
intensive editing towards a well-established sub-
language. This editing homogenises the
morphological profile of the texts but, of course,
does not go as far as homogenising the lexical
preferences of the various speakers. That is why,
contrary to the register-clustering experiments,
lexical variables expressing the particular
contrast seem to play a role in discriminating
between speakers and why the use of
Katharevousa-oriented negative particles, which
was not important in register discrimination,
seems to be of some importance in style
discrimination. The observation that negative
words play a role in style identification is in
agreement with the observations of Labbe (1983)
on the French political speech.
Structural features have turned out to be
important: the average word length, the use of
punctuation and question marks and the use of
certain parts-of-speech such as articles,
conjunctions, adjunctions and - especially -
verbs. Furthermore, the distribution of verbs into
persons and numbers seems to be important,
though the exact variables selected differ
depending on the exact set of speeches used
(these variables are of course complementary).
One of the most interesting findings of this
research is that it is important whether the
speaker delivers a &amp;quot;protoloyia&amp;quot; or not.
&amp;quot;Protoloyiai&amp;quot; can be classified at a rate of 95%
while mixed deliveries result in a lower rate, as
low as 75%. This may be caused by two factors:
I. &amp;quot;Protoloyiai&amp;quot; represent longer stretches of
text, which are more characteristic of a given
speaker.
2. Speakers prepare meticulously for their
&amp;quot;protoloyiai&amp;quot; while their other deliveries
represent a more spontaneous type of speech,
which tends to contain patterns shared by all
the parliament members.
Finally, certain additional patterns are emerging
for each of the speakers. Certain speakers (e.g.
speaker A) are more consistently recognised than
others (e.g. speaker B) while speaker B is similar
to speaker C and speaker D is similar to speaker
E. This indicates that additional variables may be
required to improve the classification accuracy
for all speakers.

As a next step, frequency of use of certain
lemmata shall be introduced since visual
inspection indicates that they may provide good
discriminatory features. We also plan to
substitute average lengths (of both words and
sentences) with the distribution of lengths.
Furthermore, we intend to introduce certain
structural measurements such as repetition of
structures, chains of nominals and the occurrence
of negation within NP phrasal constituents.
Another possible extension involves the
inclusion of the speech topic. As certain
speakers&apos; characteristics seem to change through
time, we plan to process the entire corpus of
speeches for the target period 1997-2000.
Finally, an important issue is the comparison of
the results obtained in our experiments to these
generated by alternative techniques proposed by
other researchers. This will allow the deduction
of more accurate conclusions regarding the
strengths and the weaknesses of the research
strategies.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987761904762">
In this article, ongoing research on register and
individual style categorisation of written Modern
Greek has been reported. A system has been
proposed for the automatic register
categorisation of corpora in Modern Greek
exploiting the highly inflectional nature of the
language. The results have been obtained with a
relatively constrained set of registers; however
their recognition accuracy is remarkably high,
exceeding 98% with an unseeded clustering
approach using between 3 and 6 clusters.
On the front of individual style categorisation, a
discrimination rate of over 80% was achieved for
five speakers within the Greek Parliament
register. Morphological variables were shown to
be of less importance to this task, while lexical
and structural variables seemed to take over. We
are planning to introduce several new lexical and
structural variables in order to achieve better
discrimination rates and to determine
discriminating features of the different styles.

Characteristics of Katharevousa and

<bodyText confidence="0.969616714285714">
Diglossia in Modem Greek is due to the contrast
between Katharevousa and Demotiki and is well-
manifested on the morphological level. Here we
concentrate on verb morphology.
Demotiki tends to have words ending with an &apos;open&apos;
syllable. So, 3&amp;quot;1 Plural verbal endings in —n (1) are
augmented to —ne (2).

In Demotiki, Katharevousa&apos;s consonant clusters of
two fricatives or two plosives are converted into
clusters of one fricative and one plosive (3) — (4)
(Holton et al., 1997, pp. 14).

Using clustering techniques and features reflecting the diglossia phenomenon, we have successfully discriminated registers in Modern Greek. However, diglossia information has not been shown sufficient to distinguish among individual styles within one register. Instead, a large number of linguistic features need to be studied with methods such as discriminant analysis in order to obtain a high degree of discrimination accuracy.</abstract>

Kilgarriff (1996) employs mainly the frequencyof-occurrence of words while Karlgren (1999) applies statistical methods primarily on structural and part-of-speech information. Baayen et al. (1996), who study the topic of author identification, apply statistical measures and methods on syntactic rewrite rules resulting by processing a given set of texts. They report that the accuracy thus obtained is higher than when applying the same statistical measures to the original text. On the other hand, Biber (1995) uses Multidimensional Analysis coupled with a large number of linguistic features to distinguish among registers. The underlying idea is that, rather than being distinguished on the basis of a set of linguistic features, registers are distinguished on the basis of combinations of weighted linguistic features, the so-called &amp;quot;dimensions&amp;quot;. This article reports on the discrimination of texts in written Modern Greek. The ongoing research described here has followed two distinct directions.

This is evident in Biber&apos;s work (1995) for the English language, where a variety of grammatical and macro-structural linguistic features but no morphological variation features were employed. It seems then that corpora of languages which are characterised by the phenomenon of diglossia, may be successfully categorisable on the basis of morphological information (or other reflexes of diglossia). Such a discrimination method may give results as satisfactory as approaches which are closer to the Biber (1995) spirit and rely on PoS and structural measures (see Tables 1 and 2). Tables 1 and 2 show that the accuracy of clustering reaches approximately 99% while the seeded clustering approach had a high degree of accuracy, reaching 100% when using 5 clusters. For the 27-element vector with both morphological and PoS information, perfect clustering has been achieved even with 4 clusters. On the other hand, a successful clustering (albeit with a lower level of accuracy) is achieved using only structural and PoS information. It should be noted that the lexical variables used, that is the negation partic</context>

Katharevousa was the official language of the Greek State until 1979 when it was replaced by Demotiki. By that time, Demotiki was the established language of literature while, in times, it had been the language of elementary education. Compared to Demotiki, Katharevousa bears an important resemblance to Ancient Greek manifested explicitly on the morphological level and the use of the lexicon. At a second step, we dropped the Katharevousa-Demotiki approach and relied on part-of-speech information, which is often exploited in text categorisation experiments (for instance, see Biber et al. 1998). Again, we obtained satisfactory results. 2.1 Method of work The variables used to distinguish among registers may be grouped into the following categories: 1. Morphological variables: These were verbal endings quantifying the contrast Katharevousa / Demotiki. Although the morphological differences between these two variations of Greek are not limited to the verb paradigm, we focused on the latter since it better highlights the contrast under consideration (Tambouratzis et al., 2000). A total of 230 verbal endings were selected, split into 145 Demotiki and 85 Katharevousa endings (see also th</context>

Instead, a large number of linguistic features need to be studied with methods such as discriminant analysis in order to obtain a high degree of discrimination accuracy. 1 Introduction The identification of the language style characterising the constituent parts of a corpus is very important to several applications. For example, in information retrieval applications, where large corpora of texts need to be searched efficiently, it is useful to have information about the language style used in each text, to improve the accuracy of the search (Karlgren, 1999). In fact, the criteria regarding language style may differ for each search and therefore — due to the large number of texts — there is a requirement to perform style categorisation in an automated manner. Such systems normally use statistical methods to evaluate the properties of given texts. The complexity of the studied properties varies. Kilgarriff (1996) employs mainly the frequencyof-occurrence of words while Karlgren (1999) applies statistical methods primarily on structural and part-of-speech information. Baayen et al.

Structural macro-features: average sentence length, number of commas, dashes and brackets (total of 4 variables). 4. After the completion of the experiments with variables of type 1-3 (Tambouratzis et al., 2000), Part-of-Speech (PoS) counts were introduced. The PoS categories were adjectives, adjunctions, adverbs, articles, conjunctions, nouns, pronouns, numerals, particles, verbs and a hold-all category (for non-classifiable entries), resulting in 11 variables expressed as percentages. These variables are more similar to the characteristics used by Karlgren (1999), and differ considerably from those used by Kilgarriff (1996) and Baayen et al. (1996). For the metrics of the first and third categories, a custom-built program was used running under Linux. This program calculated all structural and morphological metrics for each text in a single pass and the results were processed with the help of a spreadsheet package. The metrics of the second category were calculated using a custombuilt program in the C programming language.

That is why, contrary to the register-clustering experiments, lexical variables expressing the particular contrast seem to play a role in discriminating between speakers and why the use of Katharevousa-oriented negative particles, which was not important in register discrimination, seems to be of some importance in style discrimination. The observation that negative words play a role in style identification is in agreement with the observations of Labbe (1983) on the French political speech. Structural features have turned out to be important: the average word length, the use of punctuation and question marks and the use of certain parts-of-speech such as articles, conjunctions, adjunctions and - especially - verbs. Furthermore, the distribution of verbs into persons and numbers seems to be important, though the exact variables selected differ depending on the exact set of speeches used (these variables are of course complementary). One of the most interesting findings of this research is that it is important whether the speaker delivers a &amp;quot;protolo</context>

Morphological variables: These were verbal endings quantifying the contrast Katharevousa / Demotiki. Although the morphological differences between these two variations of Greek are not limited to the verb paradigm, we focused on the latter since it better highlights the contrast under consideration (Tambouratzis et al., 2000). A total of 230 verbal endings were selected, split into 145 Demotiki and 85 Katharevousa endings (see also the Appendix). These 230 frequencies-of-occurrence were grouped into 12 variables for use in the statistical analysis. 2. Lexical variables: Certain negation particles (ovoeic, ovoirore, ovoquoti, civet)) clearly signify a preference for Katharevousa while others (5ixcoc, p4re, xcopig) are clear indicators of Demotiki. However, the most frequently used negation particles (oxt, lam 5ev) are not characteristic of either of the two variations. 3. Structural macro-features: average sentence</context>

This dataset was processed using both seeded and unseeded clustering techniques with between 3 and 6 clusters. The unseeded approach confirmed the existence of distinct natural classes, which correspond to the three registers. The seeded approach confirmed the ability to accurately separate these three registers and to cluster their elements together. Initially, a &apos;short&apos; data vector containing only the 12 morphological variables quantifying the Demotiki/Katharevousa contrast was used (Tambouratzis et al. 2000), as well as a 16-element vector combining structural and morphological characteristics. The seeds for the Parliament and History registers were chosen randomly. The seeds for the Fiction register were chosen so that at least one of them would not be 36 an &amp;quot;outlier- of the Fiction register. Representative results are shown in Table 1 for the different vectors and numbers of clusters. In each case, the classification rate quoted corresponds to the number of text elements correctly classified (according to the register of the respective seed). 12-elem. 16-elem. 6 dust. 95.6% 98.5% 4 dust. 97.1% </context>
