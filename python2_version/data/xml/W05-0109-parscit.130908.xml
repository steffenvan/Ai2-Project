The lack of persons trained in computa-
tional linguistic methods is a severe obsta-
cle to making the Internet and computers
accessible to people all over the world in
their own languages. The paper discusses
the experiences of designing and teach-
ing an introductory course in Natural Lan-
guage Processing to graduate computer
science students at Addis Ababa Univer-
sity, Ethiopia, in order to initiate the ed-
ucation of computational linguists in the
Horn of Africa region.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999575625">
The development of tools and methods for language
processing has so far concentrated on a fairly small
number of languages and mainly on the ones used
in the industrial part of the world. However, there
is a potentially even larger need for investigating the
application of computational linguistic methods to
the languages of the developing countries: the num-
ber of computer and Internet users of these coun-
tries is growing, while most people do not speak the
European and East-Asian languages that the com-
putational linguistic community has so far mainly
concentrated on. Thus there is an obvious need to
develop a wide range of applications in vernacular
languages, such as translation systems, spelling and
grammar checkers, speech synthesis and recogni-
tion, information retrieval and filtering, and so forth.

But who will develop those systems? A prerequisite
to the creation of NLP applications is the education
and training of computer professionals skilled in lo-
calisation and development of language processing
resources. To this end, the authors were invited to
conduct a course in Natural Language Processing at
the School of Information Studies for Africa, Addis
Ababa University, Ethiopia. As far as we know, this
was the first computational linguistics course given
in Ethiopia and in the entire Horn of Africa region.
There are several obstacles to progress in lan-
guage processing for new languages. Firstly, the par-
ticulars of a language itself might force new strate-
gies to be developed. Secondly, the lack of already
available language processing resources and tools
creates a vicious circle: having resources makes pro-
ducing resources easier, but not having resources
makes the creation and testing of new ones more dif-
ficult and time-consuming.
Thirdly, there is often a disturbing lack of interest
(and understanding) of the needs of people to be able
to use their own language in computer applications
— a lack of interest in the surrounding world, but
also sometimes even in the countries where a lan-
guage is used (“Aren’t those languages going to be
extinct in 50–100 years anyhow?” and “Our com-
pany language is English” are common comments).
And finally, we have the problem that the course
described in this paper mainly tries to address, the
lack of skilled professionals and researchers with
knowledge both of language processing techniques
and of the domestic language(s) in question.

The rest of the paper is laid out as follows: The next
section discusses the language situation in Ethiopia
and some of the challenges facing those trying to in-
troduce NLP methods in the country. Section 3 gives
the background of the students and the university,
before Section 4 goes into the effects these factors
had on the way the course was designed.
The sections thereafter describe the actual course
content, with Section 5 being devoted to the lectures
of the first half of the course, on general linguistics
and word level processing; Section 6 is on the sec-
ond set of lectures, on higher level processing and
applications; while Section 7 is on the hands-on ex-
ercises we developed. The evaluation of the course
and of the students’ performance is the topic of Sec-
tion 8, and Section 9 sums up the experiences and
novelties of the course and the effects it has so far
had on introducing NLP in Ethiopia.

2 Languages and NLP in Ethiopia
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999912">
Ethiopia was the only African country that managed
to avoid being colonised during the big European
power struggles over the continent during the 19th
century. While the languages of the former colonial
powers dominate the higher educational system and
government in many other countries, it would thus
be reasonable to assume that Ethiopia would have
been using a vernacular language for these purposes.
However, this is not the case. After the removal
of the Dergue junta, the Constitution of 1994 di-
vided Ethiopia into nine fairly independent regions,
each with its own “nationality language”, but with
Amharic being the language for countrywide com-
munication. Until 1994, Amharic was also the prin-
cipal language of literature and medium of instruc-
tion in primary and secondary schools, but higher
education in Ethiopia has all the time been carried
out in English (Bloor and Tamrat, 1996).
The reason for adopting English as the Lingua
Franca of higher education is primarily the linguis-
tic diversity of the country (and partially also an ef-
fect of the fact that British troops liberated Ethiopia
from a brief Italian occupation during the Second
World War). With some 70 million inhabitants,
Ethiopia is the third most populous African country
and harbours more than 80 different languages —
exactly how many languages there are in a country
is as much a political as a linguistic issue; the count
of languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea together thus
differs from 70 up to 420, depending on the source;
with, for example, the Ethnologue (Gordon, 2005)
listing 89 different ones.
Half-a-dozen languages have more than 1 million
speakers in Ethiopia; three of these are dominant:
the language with most speakers today is probably
Oromo, a Cushitic language spoken in the south and
central parts of the country and written using the
Latin alphabet. However, Oromo has not reached
the same political status as the two large Semitic
languages Tigrinya and Amharic. Tigrinya is spo-
ken in Northern Ethiopia and is the official lan-
guage of neighbouring Eritrea; Amharic is spoken
in most parts of the country, but predominantly in
the Eastern, Western, and Central regions. Oromo
and Amharic are probably two of the five largest lan-
guages on the continent; however, with the dramatic
population size changes in many African coun-
tries in recent years, this is difficult to determine:
Amharic is estimated to be the mother tongue of
more than 17 million people, with at least an addi-
tional 5 million second language speakers.
As Semitic languages, Amharic and Tigrinya are
distantly related to Arabic and Hebrew; the two lan-
guages themselves are probably about as close as
are Spanish and Portuguese (Bloor, 1995). Speak-
ers of Amharic and Tigrinya are mainly Orthodox
Christians and the languages draw common roots
to the ecclesiastic Ge’ez still used by the Coptic
Church. Both languages use the Ge’ez (Ethiopic)
script, written horizontally and left-to-right (in con-
trast to many other Semitic languages). Written
Ge’ez can be traced back to at least the 4th century
A.D. The first versions of the script included con-
sonants only, while the characters in later versions
represent consonant-vowel pairs. Modern Amharic
words have consonantal roots with vowel variation
expressing difference in interpretation.
Several computer fonts have been developed for
the Ethiopic script, but for many years the languages
had no standardised computer representation. An
international standard for the script was agreed on
only in year 1998 and later incorporated into Uni-
code, but nationally there are still about 30 differ-
ent “standards” for the script, making localisation of
language processing systems and digital resources

difficult; and even though much digital information
is now being produced in Ethiopia, no deep-rooted
culture of information exchange and dissemination
has been established. In addition to the digital di-
vide, several other factors have contributed to this
situation, including lack of library facilities and cen-
tral resource sites, inadequate resources for digital
production of journals and books, and poor docu-
mentation and archive collections. The difficulties
of accessing information have led to low expecta-
tions and consequently under-utilisation of existing
information resources (Furzey, 1996).
UNESCO (2001) classifies Ethiopia among the
countries with “moribund or seriously endangered
tongues”. However, the dominating languages of
the country are not under immediate threat, and seri-
ous efforts have been made in the last years to build
and maintain linguistic resources in Amharic: a lot
of work has been carried out mainly by Ethiopian
Telecom, Ethiopian Science and Technology Com-
mission and Addis Ababa University, as well as by
Ethiopian students abroad, in particular in Germany,
Sweden and the United States. Except for some ini-
tial efforts for the related Tigrinya, work on other
Ethiopian languages has so far been scarce or non-
existent — see Alemu et al. (2003) or Eyassu and
Gamb¨ack (2005) for short overviews of the efforts
that have been made to date to develop language pro-
cessing tools for Amharic.
One of the reasons for fostering research in lan-
guage processing in Ethiopia was that the exper-
tise of a pool of researchers in the country would
contribute to maintaining those Ethiopian languages
that are in danger of extinction today. Starting
with Amharic and developing a robust linguistic re-
source base in the country, together with including
the Amharic language in modern language process-
ing tools could create the critical mass of experience,
which is necessary in order to expand to other ver-
nacular languages, too.
Moreover, the development of those conditions
that lay the foundations for language and speech
processing research and development in the country
would prevent potential brain drain from Ethiopia;
instead of most language processing work being
done by Ethiopian students abroad (at present), in
the future it could be done by students, researchers
and professionals inside the country itself.

<bodyText confidence="0.999928739130435">
Addis Ababa University (AAU) is Ethiopia’s old-
est, largest and most prestigious university. The De-
partment of Information Science (formerly School
of Information Studies for Africa) at the Faculty of
Informatics conducts a two-year Master’s Program.
The students admitted to the program come from
all over the country and have fairly diverse back-
grounds. All have a four-year undergraduate degree,
but not necessarily in any computer science-related
subject. However, most of the students have been
working with computers for some time after their
under-graduate studies. Those admitted to the pro-
gram are mostly among the top students of Ethiopia,
but some places are reserved for public employees.
The initiative of organising a language process-
ing course as part of the Master’s Program came
from the students themselves: several students ex-
pressed interest in writing theses on speech and lan-
guage subjects, but the faculty acknowledged that
there was a severe lack of staff qulified to teach the
course. In fact, all of the university is under-staffed,
while admittance to the different graduate programs
has been growing at an enormous speed; by 400%
only in the last two years. There was already an
ICT support program in effect between AAU and
SAREC, the Department for Research Cooperation
at the Swedish International Development Coopera-
tion Agency. This cooperation was used to establish
contacts with Stockholm University and the Swedish
Institute of Computer Science, that both had experi-
ence in developing computational linguistic courses.
Information Science is a modern department with
contemporary technology. It has two computer labs
with PCs having Internet access and lecture rooms
with all necessary aids. A library supports the teach-
ing work and is accessible both to students and staff.
The only technical problems encountered arose from
the frequent power failures in the country that cre-
ated difficulties in teaching and/or loss of data. In-
ternet access in the region is also often slow and un-
reliable. However, as a result of the SAREC ICT
support program, AAU is equipped with both an in-
ternal network and with broadband connection to the
outside world. The central computer facilities are
protected from power failures by generators, but the
individual departments have no such back-up.

The first two lectures presented the concept of a
human language. The lectures focused around five
questions: What is language? What is the ecolog-
ical situation of the world’s languages and of the
main languages of Ethiopia? What differences are
there between languages? What makes spoken and
written modalities of language different? How are
human languages built up?
The second lecture concluded with a discussion of
what information you would need to build a certain
NLP application for a language such as Amharic.

Phonology and writing systems were addressed in
a lecture focusing on the differences between writ-

Ethiopic script into Latin characters was presented.
These problems were also discussed in a lab class.

<bodyText confidence="0.999991454545455">
After a presentation of general morphological con-
cepts, the students were given an introduction to
the morphology of Amharic. As a means of hand-
ling morphology, regular languages/expressions and
finite-state methods were presented and their limi-
tations when processing non-agglutinative morphol-
ogy were discussed. The corresponding lab exercise
aimed at describing Amharic noun morphology us-
ing regular expressions.
In all, the areas of phonology and morphology
were allotted two lectures and about five lab classes.

Under this heading the students were acquainted
with word level phenomena during two lectures. To-
kenisation problems were discussed and the concept
of dependency relations introduced. This led on
to the introduction of the phrase-level and N-gram
models of syntax. As examples of applications us-
ing this kind of knowledge, different types of part-
of-speech taggers using local syntactic information
were discussed. The corresponding lab exercise,
spanning four lab classes, aimed at building N-gram
models for use in such a system.
The last lecture of the first part of the course
addressed lexical semantics with a quick glance at
word sense ambiguation and information retrieval.

<bodyText confidence="0.999958529411765">
The second part of the course started with an
overview lecture on natural language processing
systems and finished off by a final feedback lecture,
in which the course and the exam were summarised
and students could give overall feedback on the total
course contents and requirements.
The overview lecture addressed the topic of what
makes up present-day language processing systems,
using the metaphor of Douglas Adams’ Babel fish
(Adams, 1979): “What components do we need to
build a language processing system performing the
tasks of the Babel fish?” — to translate unrestricted
speech in one language to another language — with
Gamb¨ack (1999) as additional reading material.
In all, the second course part consisted of nine
regular lectures, two laboratory exercises, and the

6.1 Machine Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999735">
The first main application area introduced was Ma-
chine Translation (MT). The instruction consisted
of two 3-hour lectures during which the following
subjects were presented: definitions and history of
machine translation; different types of MT systems;
paradigms of functional MT systems and translation
memories today; problems, terminology, dictionar-
ies for MT; other kinds of translation aids; a brief
overview of the MT market; MT users, evaluation,
and application of MT systems in real life. Parts of
Arnold et al. (1994) complemented the course book.
There was no obligatory assignment in this part
of the course, but the students were able to try out
and experiment with online machine translation sys-
tems. Since there is no MT system for Amharic, they
used their knowledge of other languages (German,
French, English, Italian, etc.) to experience the use
of automatic translation tools.

discussed when moving on to more deeper-level,
unification-based grammars.
In order to give the students an understanding of
the parsing problem, both processing of artificial and
natural languages was discussed, as well as human
language processing, in the view of Kimball (1973).
Several types of parsers were introduced, with in-
creasing complexity: top-down and bottom-up pars-
ing; parsing with well-formed substring tables and
charts; head-first parsing and LR parsing.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999615">
6.3 Semantics and discourse
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997755">
Computational semantics and pragmatics were cov-
ered in two lectures. The first lecture introduced
the basic tools used in current approaches to se-
mantic processing, such as lexicalisation, compo-
sitionality and syntax-driven semantic analysis, to-
gether with different ways of representing meaning:
first-order logic, model-based and lambda-based se-
mantics. Important sources of semantic ambiguity
(quantifiers, for example) were discussed together
with the solutions allowed by using underspecified
semantic representations.
The second lecture continued the semantic repre-
sentation thread by moving on to how a complete
discourse may be displayed in a DRS, a Discourse
Representation Structure, and how this may be used
to solve problems like reference resolution. Dia-
logue and user modelling were introduced, covering
several current conversational systems, with Zue and
Glass (2000) and Wilks and Catizone (2000) as extra
reading material.

The final lecture before the exam was the only one
devoted to speech technology and spoken language
translation systems. Some problems in current spo-

speech synthesis and multimodal synthesis were just
briefly touched upon. The bulk of the lecture con-
cerned automatic speech recognition: the parts and
architectures of state-of-the-art speech recognition
systems, Bayes’ rule, acoustic modeling, language
modeling, and search strategies, such as Viterbi and
A-star were introduced, as well as attempts to build
recognition systems based on hybrids between Hid-

<bodyText confidence="0.999994277777778">
Even though we knew before the course that the stu-
dents’ actual programming skills were not extensive,
we firmly believe that the best way to learn Compu-
tational Linguistics is by hands-on experience. Thus
a substantial part of the course was devoted to a set
of laboratory exercises, which made up almost half
of the overall grade on the course.
Each exercise was designed so that there was an
(almost obligatory) short introductory lecture on the
topic and the requirements of the exercise, followed
by several opportunities for the students to work on
the exercise in the computer lab under supervision
from the lecturer. To pass, the students both had
to show a working system solving the set problem
and hand in a written solution/explanation. Students
were allowed to work together on solving the prob-
lem, while the textual part had to be handed in by
each student individually, for grading purposes.

The laboratory exercises during the first half of the
course were intended to give the students hands-
on experience of simple language processing using
standard UNIX tools and simple Perl scripts. The
platform was cygwin,1 a freeware UNIX-like envi-

on regular expressions and the exercises included
searching using ‘grep’, simple text preprocessing us-
ing ‘sed’, and building a (rather simplistic) model
of Amharic noun morphology using regular expres-
sions in (template) Perl scripts. The third lab exer-
cise was devoted to the construction of probabilis-
tic N-gram data from text corpora. Again standard
UNIX tools were used.
Due to the students’ lack of experience with this
type of computer processing, more time than ex-
pected was spent on acquainting them with the
UNIX environment during the first lab excercises.

speech tagging. Most of these were supervised from
Stockholm by the NLP course teaching team, with
support from the teaching staff in Addis Ababa.
As a short-term effect, several scientific papers
were generated by the Master theses efforts. As
a more lasting effect, a previously fairly unknown
field was not only tapped, but also triggered the stu-
dents’ interest for further research. Another impor-
tant result was the strengthening of the connections
between Ethiopian and Swedish academia, with on-
going collaboration and supervision, also of students
from later batches. Still, the most important long-
term effect may have been indirect: triggered by the
success of the course, the Addis Ababa Faculty of
Informatics in the spring of 2005 decided to estab-
lish a professorship in Natural Language Processing.

The overview lecture addressed the topic of what makes up present-day language processing systems, using the metaphor of Douglas Adams’ Babel fish (Adams, 1979): “What components do we need to build a language processing system performing the tasks of the Babel fish?” — to translate unrestricted speech in one language to another language — with Gamb¨ack (1999) as additional reading material. In all, the second course part consisted of nine regular lectures, two laboratory exercises, and the final evaluation lecture. 6.1 Machine Translation The first main application area introduced was Machine Translation (MT).

However, the dominating languages of the country are not under immediate threat, and serious efforts have been made in the last years to build and maintain linguistic resources in Amharic: a lot of work has been carried out mainly by Ethiopian Telecom, Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission and Addis Ababa University, as well as by Ethiopian students abroad, in particular in Germany, Sweden and the United States. Except for some initial efforts for the related Tigrinya, work on other Ethiopian languages has so far been scarce or nonexistent — see Alemu et al. (2003) or Eyassu and Gamb¨ack (2005) for short overviews of the efforts that have been made to date to develop language processing tools for Amharic. One of the reasons for fostering research in language processing in Ethiopia was that the expertise of a pool of researchers in the country would contribute to maintaining those Ethiopian languages that are in danger of extinction today. Starting with Amharic and developing a robust linguistic resource base in the country, together with including the Amharic language in modern language processing tools could create the critical mass of experience, whic</context>

The instruction consisted of two 3-hour lectures during which the following subjects were presented: definitions and history of machine translation; different types of MT systems; paradigms of functional MT systems and translation memories today; problems, terminology, dictionaries for MT; other kinds of translation aids; a brief overview of the MT market; MT users, evaluation, and application of MT systems in real life. Parts of Arnold et al. (1994) complemented the course book. There was no obligatory assignment in this part of the course, but the students were able to try out and experiment with online machine translation systems. Since there is no MT system for Amharic, they used their knowledge of other languages (German, French, English, Italian, etc.) to experience the use of automatic translation tools. 6.2 Syntax and parsing Three lectures and one laboratory exercise were devoted to parsing and the representation of syntax, and to some present-day syntactic theories.

However, this is not the case. After the removal of the Dergue junta, the Constitution of 1994 divided Ethiopia into nine fairly independent regions, each with its own “nationality language”, but with Amharic being the language for countrywide communication. Until 1994, Amharic was also the principal language of literature and medium of instruction in primary and secondary schools, but higher education in Ethiopia has all the time been carried out in English (Bloor and Tamrat, 1996). The reason for adopting English as the Lingua Franca of higher education is primarily the linguistic diversity of the country (and partially also an effect of the fact that British troops liberated Ethiopia from a brief Italian occupation during the Second World War). With some 70 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is the third most populous African country and harbours more than 80 different languages — exactly how many languages there are in a country is as much a political as a linguistic issue; the count of languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea together thus differs from 70 up to 420, depending o</context>

Oromo and Amharic are probably two of the five largest languages on the continent; however, with the dramatic population size changes in many African countries in recent years, this is difficult to determine: Amharic is estimated to be the mother tongue of more than 17 million people, with at least an additional 5 million second language speakers. As Semitic languages, Amharic and Tigrinya are distantly related to Arabic and Hebrew; the two languages themselves are probably about as close as are Spanish and Portuguese (Bloor, 1995). Speakers of Amharic and Tigrinya are mainly Orthodox Christians and the languages draw common roots to the ecclesiastic Ge’ez still used by the Coptic Church. Both languages use the Ge’ez (Ethiopic) script, written horizontally and left-to-right (in contrast to many other Semitic languages). Written Ge’ez can be traced back to at least the 4th century A.D. The first versions of the script included consonants only, while the characters in later versions represent consonant-vowel pairs. Modern Amharic words have consonantal roots with vowel variation expressing difference in interpretation. Se</context>

After introducing basic context-free grammars, Dependency Grammar was taken as an example of a theory underlying many current shallow processing systems. Definite Clause Grammar, feature structures, the 53 concept of unification, and subcategorisation were discussed when moving on to more deeper-level, unification-based grammars. In order to give the students an understanding of the parsing problem, both processing of artificial and natural languages was discussed, as well as human language processing, in the view of Kimball (1973). Several types of parsers were introduced, with increasing complexity: top-down and bottom-up parsing; parsing with well-formed substring tables and charts; head-first parsing and LR parsing. 6.3 Semantics and discourse Computational semantics and pragmatics were covered in two lectures. The first lecture introduced the basic tools used in current approaches to semantic processing, such as lexicalisation, compositionality and syntax-driven semantic analysis, together with different ways of representing meaning: first-order logic, model-based and lambda-based semantics.

Important sources of semantic ambiguity (quantifiers, for example) were discussed together with the solutions allowed by using underspecified semantic representations. The second lecture continued the semantic representation thread by moving on to how a complete discourse may be displayed in a DRS, a Discourse Representation Structure, and how this may be used to solve problems like reference resolution. Dialogue and user modelling were introduced, covering several current conversational systems, with Zue and Glass (2000) and Wilks and Catizone (2000) as extra reading material. 6.4 Speech technology The final lecture before the exam was the only one devoted to speech technology and spoken language translation systems. Some problems in current spoken dialogue systems were discussed, while text-tospeech synthesis and multimodal synthesis were just briefly touched upon. The bulk of the lecture concerned automatic speech recognition: the parts and architectures of state-of-the-art speech recognition systems, Bayes’ rule, acoustic modeling, language modeling, and search strategies, such as Viterbi and A-star were introduced, as well as attempts</context>

In addition to the digital divide, several other factors have contributed to this situation, including lack of library facilities and central resource sites, inadequate resources for digital production of journals and books, and poor documentation and archive collections. The difficulties of accessing information have led to low expectations and consequently under-utilisation of existing information resources (Furzey, 1996). UNESCO (2001) classifies Ethiopia among the countries with “moribund or seriously endangered tongues”. However, the dominating languages of the country are not under immediate threat, and serious efforts have been made in the last years to build and maintain linguistic resources in Amharic: a lot of work has been carried out mainly by Ethiopian Telecom, Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission and Addis Ababa University, as well as by Ethiopian students abroad, in particular in Germany, Sweden and the United States. Except for some initial efforts for the related Tigrinya, work on other Ethiopian langua</context>
