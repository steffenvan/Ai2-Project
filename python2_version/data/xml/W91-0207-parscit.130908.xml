One problem in the design of a lexicon for natural language processing is the repre-
sentation of semantic knowledge. We examine the adequacy of knowledge representa-
tion formalisms developed in artificial intelligence, in particular of term subsumption
languages for these issues. In order to derive some basic requirements for a suitable
representation language we analyze a number of definitions of a monolingual dictio-
nary.

The lexicon as one of the major linguisitic knowledge sources of a natural language process-
ing (NLP) system contains among others morphological, syntactic and semantic knowl-
edge. The design of an appropriate lexicon involves the following questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.953347833333333">
• Which size is required for the lexicon for a given application?
• What are the units of the vocabulary?
• How should lexical information be represented?
• What kinds of techniques should be applied for generating a large lexicon, e.g., could
the lexicon be partially generated by extracting information from machine-readable
dictionaries?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983747461538461">
In this paper we address the third problem, more precisely the representation of se-
mantic information.
Semantic knowledge is crucial for both understanding and generating natural language.
One important class of representation models for semantic knowledge are the network
models, which have been influenced by early association models. In network models, word
meanings can be described by relationships to other word meanings. In contrast, other
models for representing semantic knowledge aim at the representation of structural aspects
of word meanings so that a particular word meaning is built up by a set of particular
semantic features.
During the last years, a number of knowledge representation (KR) systems have been
built using term subsumption languages (TSLs). TSLs are formal languages for .defining
concepts by reference to superconcepts and by specification of additional features. Because
of the similarity of concept descriptions in TSLs and dictionary definitions based on &amp;quot;genus

proximum et differentia specifica&amp;quot;, it seems useful to investigate to what extent TSLs can
be used for the representation of word meanings.
In the next section, we discuss some properties of TSLs and their relation to other KR
formalisms. In order to get some hints whether TSLs are suitable for the representation
of word meanings we examine several dictionary definitions. Next, we give a short intro-
duction to our terminological formalism and outline, how the formalism can be integrated
into a lexicon. Finally, we summarize the results and give a short survey of our current
work.

2 Knowledge representation and TSLs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988971428571">
In the field of Al, many researchers have addressed the problem of knowledge representa-
tion; in this area semantic networks played an important role. In semantic networks the
knowledge is described by nodes and links. While Quillian aimed at the representation
of word meanings [Quillian 68], semantic networks have also been used to model proposi-
tions, events, spatial relationships and so on. Since semantic networks failed in providing
a unique semantic interpretation, several researchers examined the &amp;quot;semantics of semantic
networks&amp;quot; ([Woods 75], [Brachman 79]).
Another approach is to organize knowledge in chunks called frames [Minsky 75] which
are used to represent &amp;quot;stereotypical situations&amp;quot;. Frames typically allow the specification
of default slot values, perspectives and attached procedures. Collections of frames can be
combined to frame-systems. The expressive power of frame systems makes it impossible
to provide a well defined semantics for them.
Both, elements of different network formalisms and basics of the frame theory, have
influenced the structural inheritance networks and the subsequent implementations (KL-
ONE, [BrachmanSchmolze 85]). The basic idea is to postulate a level of knowledge repre-
sentation with &amp;quot;knowledge structuring primitives, rather than particular knowledge prim-
itives&amp;quot; ([Brachman 791), the so-called epistemological level. The basic buildung blocks
of KL-ONE representations are &amp;quot;concepts&amp;quot;, i.e. structured conceptual objects. &amp;quot;Roles&amp;quot;
are possible relationships between two concepts. The subsumption relation organizes the
concepts in a concept taxonomy. Concepts are described with respect to their supercon-
cepts by restricting and differentiating roles. In particular, roles can be restricted by the
number (number restriction) and the range (value restriction) of allowed role fillers. If the
specified restrictions constitute necessary and sufficient conditions for the concept, it is
called a defined concept, wheras primitive concepts only need necessary conditions. Clas-
sification, an important inference mechanism of KL-ONE like systems, inserts concepts at
the correct place in the concept hierarchy.
A logical reconstruction of KL-ONE revealed that the semantic status of a number
of notions of KL-ONE was rather unclear. TSLs are formal knowledge representation
languages derived from KL-ONE providing well-defined semantics which enables the de-
cision whether the inferences are sound and complete. A number of KR systems based
on TSLs have been developed, for instance, Krypton [Brachman et al. 85], KL-Two [Vi-
lain 85], Back [Peltason et al. 89], Loom [MacGregorBates 871 Besides a component for
defining concepts and reasoning about the relationships between concepts (terminological
component, TBox) these systems include an assertional component (ABox) that allows
the definition of assertions about individuals.

3 Representing word meanings with TSLs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996896875">
While aspects of syntactic structure are rather well understood in NLP, the problem of
representing semantic information is far from being solved. Scientists from various re-
search areas, e.g., linguistics, philosophy of language, lexicology and artificial intelligence,
are dealing with problems concering the nature of word meanings and means for their
representation.
In the following, we make some general remarks on semantic description without going
into details of any semantic theory. A particular aspect all semantic theories are concerned
with is the principle of compositionality: the meaning of a sentence is a function of the
meaning of each of its components and its context. As a first approximation, one could ab-
stract away from the context or assume a typical context (paradigmatic analysis). A good
semantic theory, however, must allow the notion of semantic variation. So, in addition to
the enumeration of possibly different senses of a word, we have to examine the meaning
of a word in varying contexts (syntagmatic analysis). Also, a finite enumeration of word
senses does not suffice to explain the creative use of words ([BoguraevPustejovsky 90]).
In addition to syntactic and semantic knowledge, the process of understanding natural
language involves extralinguistic (encyclopedic) knowledge. Mechanisms for the combi-
nation of these types of knowledge are an important prerequisite for natural language
understanding.
The analysis of word meanings is also the subject of dictionary definitions. During the
last years, there has been an increasing interest in methods for extracting lexical semantic
information from machine-readable dictionaries (see for example [BoguraevBriscoe 89]).
There is, however, no consensus about the representation formalism into which the mean-
ing descriptions should be transformed. In our opinion, the suitability of AI-based KR
formalisms for the representation of semantic knowledge and as a means for the combi-
nation of linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge has to be investigated. As a first step,
we are analyzing a number of simple dictionary definitions in order to derive some basic
requirements which a representation language has to meet to be usable for the represen-
tation of word meanings. The results will allow us to assess the suitability of TSLs for
that matter.
In a dictionary, different meanings of a word are usually specified by means of def-
initions, examples, references and pictures.&apos; Subsequently, we will concentrate on the
analysis of meaning definitions. There exist different types of definitions, e.g.,2
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992993166666667">
• definition by reference to synonyms
— acclaim: applause; approval.
— complaint: illness; disease.
— jowl: jaw.
• definition by reference to antonyms
— absolute: not relative.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.808722">
1A comparison between different types of dictionaries and a closer investigation of the definitions in a
dictionary can not be given here. See for example [Hausmann 85].
2 Even though we investigated german definitions from the Duden Bedeutungsw5rterbuch ([Duden 85])
the definitions we mention in this section are taken from the machine-readable version of the Oxford
Advanced Learner&apos;s Dictionary (10ALD 88]) because it turned out to be difficult to translate the german
definitions without loss of information.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990377">

<listItem confidence="0.989667166666667">
— affected: not natural or genuine.
— wild: (of plants) not cultivated.
• definiton by reference to hyperonyms and modifying elements
— park: public garden or public recreation ground in a town.
— bobsled: large, long sleigh with brake and steering wheel, used for racing.
— blackboard: board used in schools for writing and drawing on with chalk.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8975916">
We will have a closer look at nominal definitions of the latter type which contain a
genus term of the defined word.3
The first part of the definition of park, namely &amp;quot;public garden&amp;quot;, can be represented
by a concept with superconcept garden and a relation called PROPERTY to the concept
public:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.985049333333333">
a park is a
garden
with PROPERTY public
</figure>
<figureCaption confidence="0.942234">
A visualization of this definition (in a KL-ONE-like graphical notation) is given in
Fig. 1.
Figure 1: Representation of park
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.885034181818182">
The concept identifiers, e.g., garden, in the example have to be distinguished from the
corresponding word forms.4 Each concept represents one of the possible meanings of the
corresponding word.
This example shows at least two problems of representing word meanings with TSLs.
The main problem arises from the fact, that the epistemological primitives of a TSL do
not give enough specifications for the representation of word meanings. Many nominal
definitions contain nouns modified with adjectives. We need a number of predefined
31n the German monolingual defining dictionary [Duden 85] around 70% out of a sample of 126 ran-
domly chosen definitions of nouns are of that type.
4In order to distinguish between concepts and words concepts are in the following printed in typewriter
style.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991967">
70
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.992744666666667">
and modifiable roles, like the relation PROPERTY between the nominal concepts and the
concepts representing these adjectives.
Another important relation for the representation of noun meanings is the part-whole
relation, called meronymy. An example is the definition of bobsled: large, long sleigh with
brake and steering wheel, used for racing. The concept bobsled refers to the parts brake
and steering-wheel:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.676388">
a bobsled is a
sleigh
with PROPERTY large
with PROPERTY long
with PART brake
with PART steering-wheel
with FUNCTION racing
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992809">
This example shows a third class of important relations for the definition of noun
meanings, i.e. the normal uses or functions of a thing. The relations can be further
specialized, e.g., the PART relation describes different types of meronymy like COMPONENT,
MEMBER, MATERIAL (see [Miller et al. 90]).
The part-whole relation is a relation between nominal concepts and can be represented
in a TSL-based KR formalism by means of roles. Number and type of given parts can
be described by number restriction and value restriction respectively. Different parts of a
thing have to be specified by different subroles of a more general PART role. In the example
above the two components brake and steering-wheel have to be related to bobsled by
two COMPONENT roles:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.7331406">
a bobsled is a
sleigh
with COMPONENT1 brake
with COMPONENT2 steering-wheel
The roles are organized in a role hierarchy:
</figure>
<footnote confidence="0.784809">
COMPONENT is a PART
COMPONENT1 is a COMPONENT
COMPONENT2 is a COMPONENT
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998061">
The PROPERTY relation is a relation between nominal concepts and &amp;quot;property concepts&amp;quot;,
e.g., public in the first example. Such kinds of concepts do not fit into a term hierarchy
because they usually do not have suitable superconcepts or individuals. Consequently,
the most important inference mechanism of TSLs, namely classification is unsuitable for
the representation of property concepts. We presumably need another formalism for the
representation of properties, in which other relations, for example antonymy, play an
important role ([GrossMiller 90]). This formalism has to be combined with the term
subsumption formalism.
The FUNCTION relation relates nominal concepts to concepts representing verb mean-
ings, e.g.,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992562">

</page>
<figure confidence="0.78871">
a bobsled is a
sleigh
with ...
with FUNCTION racing
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9743455">
The representation of verb meanings involves a number of further problems, e.g., the
representation of space and time, that can not be investigated in this paper.
Returning to the representation of nominal concepts, we try to represent the complete
definition of park: public garden or public recreation ground in a town:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.7816352">
a park is a
garden
with PROPERTY public
or is a
recreation-ground
</figure>
<figureCaption confidence="0.2422675">
with PROPERTY public
with LOCATION town
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999781">
This example demonstrates the necessity of concept disjunction. Disjunction is fre-
quently used in definitions. Therefore, a KR formalism adequate for the representation
of semantic knowledge has to provide a form of concept disjunction. Disjunction is not
allowed in TSLs because it is contrary to the claim that concepts should only be defined
with respect to their superconcepts. In the example, both &amp;quot;garden with property pub-
lic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;recreation-ground with property public and with location town&amp;quot; (subsequently
termed p-garden and p-recreation-ground respectively) are subconcepts of park, as
illustrated in Fig. 2.

<figureCaption confidence="0.999331">
Figure 2: Another representation of park
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888">
This representation of park is unsuitable because it does not guarantee that all parks
are public gardens or public recreation grounds in a town. A solution to this problem is
the notion of a &amp;quot;covering&amp;quot;, which was inroduced in NIKL ([Moser 83]). If park is defined
as a covering of p-garden and p-recreation-ground, every instance of park will be an
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997231">
instance of at least p-garden or p-recreation-ground. In NIKL coverings are used to
enhance concept specifications but they are ignored by the classifier.
The investigation of further nominal definitions revealed that several other extensions
to TSLs are necessary:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999945666666667">
• boil: hard (usu red, often painful) poisoned swelling under the skin, which bursts
when ripe.
• boulevard: wide city street, often with trees on each side.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994386">
These examples indicate the existence of typical features of a concept, called &amp;quot;defaults&amp;quot;.
Inferences with defaults require the use of nonmonotonic reasoning techniques which are
outside the scope of a TSL classifier.
The following examples show that similarity between concepts is another important
relation.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999962333333333">
• lemur: nocturnal animal of Madagascar, similar to a monkey but with a foxlike face.
• marimba: musical instrument similar to the xylophone.
• quail: small bird, similar to a partridge, valued as food.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999454166666667">
Most of the requirements mentioned above can not be integrated into a TSL main-
taining sound and complete inferences. Because these requirements seem to be necessary
for the representation of word meanings, TSLs can provide only a &amp;quot;representational ker-
nel&amp;quot;, which has to be embedded into a component with greater expressive power. This
component has to allow enhanced concept descriptions, e.g., concept disjunction, defaults
and similarity of concepts.

4 An Approach to the Integration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879555555556">
As a first step we have implemented a KR system that consists of a terminological and
an assertional component. The formalism used is similar to the formalism described in
[Nebel 90]. The restricted expressiveness enables inferences that are sound and complete
and makes the formalism suitable as a platform for the extensions described above.
A small fragment of the TBox language is illustrated in the following example. The
concept bobsled is described as a subconcept of sleigh with two PART relations, namely
COMPONENT1 and COMPONENT2. These roles have to defined separately as specializations
of COMPONENT. The concept bobsled is primitive because the specifications are necessary
but not sufficient for the definition of bobsled.

The system is implemented in CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) and an overview
of its syntax and semantics is given in [Forster et al. 91].
The formalism has to be integrated into a lexicon, a possible architecture of which
is shown in Fig. 3. The lexicon consists basically of two components: one containing
word forms and another for the representation of word meanings. The latter has to be
embedded into a component for the representation of more general world knowledge.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976555555556">
We have outlined that TSLs are KR formalisms with some interesting features. The
well-defined semantics allows to decide whether the inference algorithms are sound and
complete.
In order to use TSLs for the representation of word meanings we examined a number of
dictionary definitions. TSLs seem to be adequate for the representation of some aspects
of noun meanings, for example the subsumption and part-whole relations. There are,
however, important aspects of word meanings which can not be expressed in TSLs, e.g.,
concept disjunction, defaults and similarity between concepts. As a consequence the TSL
formalism has to be embedded into a representation system with more expressive power.
