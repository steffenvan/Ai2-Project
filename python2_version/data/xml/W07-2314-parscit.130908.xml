Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.996561769230769">
Existing generation systems use verbs almost exclu-
sively to describe actions/events or to ascribe prop-
erties. In doing so, they achieve a direct concrete
style of the kind often recommended in style man-
uals. However in many genres, including academic
writing, it is common to find verbs expressing ab-
stract relationships, with events etc. pushed down
into nominalisations. This paper illustrates two im-
portant classes of abstract verb, one expressing dis-
course relations, the other expressing participant
roles, and discusses some theoretical and practical
reasons for studying such verbs and including them
in generation systems.

<bodyText confidence="0.983300323529412">
Many writing manuals enjoin us to freshen up our
verbs. A bad writing style, they tell us, is char-
acterised by overuse of abstract verbs like ‘involve’
and ‘characterise’ (oh dear), whereas good prose is
enlivened by concrete verbs denoting actions and
events. In his book Style: Towards Clarity and
Grace (Williams, 1990) illustrates the two styles by
comparing the following sentences:
(A) Because we knew nothing about local con-
ditions, we could not determine how effectively
the committee had allocated funds to areas
that most needed assistance.
(B) Our lack of knowledge about local con-
ditions precluded determination of committee
action effectiveness in fund allocation to those
areas in greatest need of assistance.
Sentence (A), most of us would agree, is clearly ex-
pressed, while its paraphrase (B) is turgid. The
reason, according to Williams, is that the first sen-
tence expresses actions through verbs (determine,
allocate), while the second pushes them down into
nominalisations.
Computational Linguists, like most academics, are
often unable to resist the lure of the abstract verb.
But how about our programs? Let us look at some
output samples from Natural Language Generation
(NLG) systems, as surveyed by Pavia (1998).
Behrens’s principal activities were architecture and in-
dustrial design. He made electrical appliances and pro-
totype flasks. He built the high tension plant and the
turbine factory for AEG in 1908-1910. He built a hous-
ing for the workers of AEG in Henningsdorf.

These typical products of current NLG present a
paradox. On the one hand, they conform to the ad-
vice given by Joseph Williams and other style gurus.
The verbs are concrete and usually denote actions
(build, click, make). Noun phrases denote people
and things rather than nominalised events or propo-
sitions. On the other hand, the texts are not really
well-written; their short mechanical sentences sug-
gest naivety and limited expressive resources. Con-
crete writing is not always good writing; turning this
on its head, we might question whether the style
manuals are really justified in dismissing an abstract
style as necessarily bad. Perhaps we would do bet-
ter to understand why abstract writing is common
in some genres and whether it serves a purpose other
than bamboozling the reader.
As Halliday among others has pointed out (Halli-
day and Martin, 1993), an abstract style is common
in genres (like scientific writing) where argument
predominates over description. In argument, it
is often necessary to make comments upon propo-
sitions; therefore, we find many sentences in which
the subject of the verb denotes a proposition (or a
complex of propositions), either through a sentential
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999414722222222">
complement, or a nominalisation, or an anaphoric
reference to a proposition mentioned earlier. Be-
cause sentences of this kind are often needed in ar-
gumentative writing, they have taken on the signif-
icance of a hallmark through which academics can
certify their distinctive professional expertise — the
literary counterpart of the doctor’s stethoscope or
the lawyer’s wig. As a result, academics (and bu-
reaucrats, etc.) may feel obliged to write in this
way, even when the subject-matter is not argumen-
tative, and could be expressed through straightfor-
ward narration or description.
If this analysis is right, we should not dismiss ab-
stract writing as bad writing, either when writing
papers or when designing NLG systems. We should
aim for mastery of both styles, so that the system
can choose whichever is most appropriate in any
given case.

2 Discourse verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997744671428572">
The concept of an abstract verb is initially per-
plexing: when events or propositions are pushed
down into nominalisations or sentential comple-
ments, what is left for the main verb to do? One
obvious answer is that verbs can take over the task
of signalling relations among propositions: in other
words, they can express discourse relations.
Take for example sentence (B) from the last sec-
tion, ‘Our lack of knowledge about local conditions
precluded determination of committee action effec-
tiveness...’. The main verb here is ‘precluded’,
and its meaning corresponds to the relation NON-
VOLITIONAL CAUSE from Rhetorical Structure The-
ory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1987), with the
extra twist that the nucleus is negated: in general,
‘X precluded Y’ means (roughly) ‘Because X hap-
pened, Y could not happen’.
How common are verbs expressing discourse rela-
tions? This is a complex question that would re-
quire investigation of corpora from varied genres,
but merely by consulting theasuruses or works like
the Cambridge English Lexicon (Hindmarsh, 1980)
we can confirm that there are many such verbs, es-
pecially for causal and inferential relations. Here for
example are some causal verbs roughly grouped:
CAUSING: bring about, cause, induce, lead to, make
RESULTING: derive from, result from, stem from
INITIATING: launch, originate, set in motion, start
PROVOKING: arouse, elicit, evoke, provoke, trigger
HELPING: contribute to, facilitate, help, stimulate
Most of these can be used as alternatives to dis-
course connectives like ‘because’ and ‘as a result’,
except that their meanings are usually more precise.
For instance, ‘Losing his job triggered John’s de-
pression’ could be paraphrased roughly by ‘John was
depressed because he lost his job’, but the discourse
verb carries the extra implication that the depression
acquired a momentum beyond the original cause.
Considering the obvious prevalence of such dis-
course verbs, the NLG literature is curiously silent.
Almost everybody follows the standard line that
rhetorical relations are realised by discourse connec-
tives. In work based on RST, discourse relations are
assumed to hold between clauses, as in the manual
for marking up the RST Discourse Treebank (Carl-
son and Marcu, 2001), where discourse verbs are
not mentioned at all. The only references we can
find in NLG are from Laurence Danlos, who was the
first to point out that verbs like ‘cause’ and ‘pre-
cede’ can signal the relations expressed by discourse
connectives like ‘because’ and ‘next’, and to label
such verbs discourse verbs (Danlos, 2006). Among
other things, Danlos observes that the subject of a
discourse verb is often an anaphoric reference to an
event (or proposition) mentioned in a previous sen-
tence, or sometimes to the agent of this event:
Ted left. This preceded Sue’s arrival.
Ted didn’t stop joking. This (He) caused hi-
larity among his friends.
We have seen examples of verbs for CAUSE and SE-
QUENCE; how about the other RST relations? Dan-
los does not pursue this issue because she is inter-
ested mainly in issues of lexical representation in the
framework of Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory. To show that verbs can be used across the
whole spectrum of discourse relations, rather than
one or two exceptional cases, the table below lists
the original RST relations from Mann and Thomp-
son (1987) with examples (where possible) using dis-
course verbs.

3 Theta verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999183684210526">
We have noted one kind of abstract verb, the cate-
gory that Danlos calls ‘discourse verbs’. Are there
others? A plausible further candidate can be found
in verbs like ‘performed’ and ‘underwent’ which ex-
press thematic roles — that is, relations between
eventualities and their participants. When an event
is described directly, these thematic roles are ex-
pressed implicitly by syntactic relations like subject
and object:
The police interrogated the suspect
However, to highlight a thematic role we can also
express it by a verb:
The police performed an interrogation
The suspect underwent an interrogation
As a label for this group I suggest theta verbs. Here
is a list of examples for some common thematic roles;
note that some circumstantial roles are equivalent to
discourse relations so that we get some overlap with
discourse verbs.

PLACE The committee met in the city hall ⇒ The city

Some roles can be expressed by several verbs, with
different shades of meaning (e.g., for AGENT we also
have achieve, accomplish, commit, engineer, and so
forth). There is also at least one verb that can ex-
press any thematic role, thus achieving a vagueness
that may assist the non-commital writer (but not
the reader):
AGENT: The dismissal involved an American employer
PATIENT: The dismissal involved an elderly secretary
ExPERIENCER: The fear of dismissal involved the staff
BENEFICIARY: The compensation payment involved the

4 Implications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895777777778">
One reason for studying abstract verbs is simply to
enhance the quality and variety of generated texts.
This would require (a) an expansion of grammars to
cover formulations with abstract verbs, and (b) some
kind of empirical investigation into when the use of
an abstract verb is appropriate. However, discourse
verbs (in particular) are also theoretically interesting
because they challenge existing assumptions about
rhetorical relations and their realization in discourse:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.775042">
1. Argument role: In RST, argument roles are
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.939461928571429">
labelled nucleus and satellite; what happens to
these roles when the relationship is expressed
by a discourse verb? Using a verb introduces
distinctions like given-new, and notions like
agency, which are not relevant for discourse con-
nectives.
2. Syntactic features: A discourse relation ex-
pressed by a verb can draw on the distinctions
expressed by syntactic features like tense, as-
pect, voice, modality, and negation, most of
which are irrelevant for discourse connectives.
For instance, if the relation is EVIDENCE, the is-
sue of when the evidential relationship was first
noticed is made explicit by the tense of the verb.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.832528">
3. Span structure: Discourse verbs provide ad-
ditional evidence against RST’s theory of span
structure, as described by Knott et al. (2001).
4. Repertoire of relations: The classification
of rhetorical relations might look very different
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.997703">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99967925">
when based on evidence that includes discourse
verbs as well as connectives.
Points 3 and 4 require some elaboration, which is
given below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999288">
4.1 Span structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999757">
RST makes two central claims about span structure
(Knott et al., 2001): first, that atomic spans are
clauses; and second, that rhetorical relationships be-
tween spans (or their meanings) are expressed by
combining adjacent spans through a schema appli-
cation. The prototypical case is illustrated by the
following text from the CLEF domain (Hallett et
al., 2007) which realizes an EVIDENCE relation:
The patient looks anaemic, so a packed red
cell transfusion is probably needed.
The atomic spans are adjacent clauses, linked by a
discourse connective (‘so’) expressing the rhetorical
relation between them. Now consider the same mes-
sage expressed using a discourse verb:
The patient looks anaemic. This suggests
the need for a packed red cell transfusion.
It is striking how an apparently minor change throws
the RST analysis into confusion. First, the nu-
cleus of the EVIDENCE relation is now expressed
by a noun phrase; this means for example that it
could not be marked up as a rhetorical argument in
the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson and Marcu,
2001). Second, this noun phrase is not linked di-
rectly to the span describing the anaemia, but rather
to a pronoun (‘this’) coreferring anaphorically with
this span. One could argue for some kind of presen-
tational relation between the first sentence and the
second (e.g., ELABORATION), but on such an analy-
sis the rhetorical structure assigned to the text no
longer addresses its main point.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997869">
4.2 Repertoire of relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99727505">
If we try to classify discourse relations with refer-
ence to discourse verbs rather than connectives, the
most obvious change is that the verbs are more spe-
cific. We have illustrated this point already in listing
causal verbs, which subclassify causal relations along
several dimensions identified by Talmy (1988) (e.g.,
change/stasis, generation/enablement, weak/strong
control, temporary/enduring effect). Consider for
instance the following more specific alternatives to
‘John was drowsy because he took antihistamines’:
Taking antihistamines made John drowsy
Taking antihistamines kept John drowsy
Taking antihistamines enabled John to be drowsy
Taking antihistamines helped make John drowsy
Taking antihistamines triggered John’s drowsiness
Such examples suggest that discourse verbs are far
more effective than connectives in putting discourse
relations under the microscope, at least for the
groups of relations concerned with causality and in-
ference.

Repertoire of relations: The classification of rhetorical relations might look very different 95 when based on evidence that includes discourse verbs as well as connectives. Points 3 and 4 require some elaboration, which is given below. 4.1 Span structure RST makes two central claims about span structure (Knott et al., 2001): first, that atomic spans are clauses; and second, that rhetorical relationships between spans (or their meanings) are expressed by combining adjacent spans through a schema application. The prototypical case is illustrated by the following text from the CLEF domain (Hallett et al., 2007) which realizes an EVIDENCE relation: The patient looks anaemic, so a packed red cell transfusion is probably needed. The atomic spans are adjacent clauses, linked by a discourse connective (‘so’) expressing the rhetorical relation between them. Now consider the same message expressed using a discourse verb: The patient looks anaemic. This suggests the need for a packed red cell transfusion. It is striking how an apparently minor change throws the RST analysis into confusion. First, the nucleus of the EVIDENCE relation is now expressed by a noun phrase; this means for example that it could not</context>

On the other hand, the texts are not really well-written; their short mechanical sentences suggest naivety and limited expressive resources. Concrete writing is not always good writing; turning this on its head, we might question whether the style manuals are really justified in dismissing an abstract style as necessarily bad. Perhaps we would do better to understand why abstract writing is common in some genres and whether it serves a purpose other than bamboozling the reader. As Halliday among others has pointed out (Halliday and Martin, 1993), an abstract style is common in genres (like scientific writing) where argument predominates over description. In argument, it is often necessary to make comments upon propositions; therefore, we find many sentences in which the subject of the verb denotes a proposition (or a complex of propositions), either through a sentential 93 complement, or a nominalisation, or an anaphoric reference to a proposition mentioned earlier. Because sentences of this kind are often needed in argumentative writing, they have taken on the significance of a hallmark through which academics can certify their dist</context>

This is a complex question that would require investigation of corpora from varied genres, but merely by consulting theasuruses or works like the Cambridge English Lexicon (Hindmarsh, 1980) we can confirm that there are many such verbs, especially for causal and inferential relations.

One obvious answer is that verbs can take over the task of signalling relations among propositions: in other words, they can express discourse relations. Take for example sentence (B) from the last section, ‘Our lack of knowledge about local conditions precluded determination of committee action effectiveness...’. The main verb here is ‘precluded’, and its meaning corresponds to the relation NONVOLITIONAL CAUSE from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1987), with the extra twist that the nucleus is negated: in general, ‘X precluded Y’ means (roughly) ‘Because X happened, Y could not happen’.

This preceded Sue’s arrival. Ted didn’t stop joking. This (He) caused hilarity among his friends. We have seen examples of verbs for CAUSE and SEQUENCE; how about the other RST relations? Danlos does not pursue this issue because she is interested mainly in issues of lexical representation in the framework of Segmented Discourse Representation Theory. To show that verbs can be used across the whole spectrum of discourse relations, rather than one or two exceptional cases, the table below lists the original RST relations from Mann and Thompson (1987) with examples (where possible) using discourse verbs.

Sentence (A), most of us would agree, is clearly expressed, while its paraphrase (B) is turgid. The reason, according to Williams, is that the first sentence expresses actions through verbs (determine, allocate), while the second pushes them down into nominalisations. Computational Linguists, like most academics, are often unable to resist the lure of the abstract verb. But how about our programs?

One could argue for some kind of presentational relation between the first sentence and the second (e.g., ELABORATION), but on such an analysis the rhetorical structure assigned to the text no longer addresses its main point. 4.2 Repertoire of relations If we try to classify discourse relations with reference to discourse verbs rather than connectives, the most obvious change is that the verbs are more specific. We have illustrated this point already in listing causal verbs, which subclassify causal relations along several dimensions identified by Talmy (1988) (e.g., change/stasis, generation/enablement, weak/strong control, temporary/enduring effect). Consider for instance the following more specific alternatives to ‘John was drowsy because he took antihistamines’: Taking antihistamines made John drowsy Taking antihistamines kept John drowsy Taking antihistamines enabled John to be drowsy Taking antihistamines helped make John drowsy Taking antihistamines triggered John’s drowsiness Such examples suggest that discourse verbs are far more effective than connectives in putting discourse relations under the microscope, at least for the groups of rela</context>

This paper illustrates two important classes of abstract verb, one expressing discourse relations, the other expressing participant roles, and discusses some theoretical and practical reasons for studying such verbs and including them in generation systems. 1 Introduction Many writing manuals enjoin us to freshen up our verbs. A bad writing style, they tell us, is characterised by overuse of abstract verbs like ‘involve’ and ‘characterise’ (oh dear), whereas good prose is enlivened by concrete verbs denoting actions and events. In his book Style: Towards Clarity and Grace (Williams, 1990) illustrates the two styles by comparing the following sentences: (A) Because we knew nothing about local conditions, we could not determine how effectively the committee had allocated funds to areas that most needed assistance. (B) Our lack of knowledge about local conditions precluded determination of committee action effectiveness in fund allocation to those areas in greatest need of assistance. Sentence (A), most of us would agree, is clearly expressed, while its paraphrase (B) is turgid. The reason, according to Williams, is that the first sentence expresses actions through verbs (determi</context>
