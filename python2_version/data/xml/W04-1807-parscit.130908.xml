Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959368421053">
Terminology structuring aims to elicit semantic re-
lations between the terms of a domain. We propose
here to exploit definitions found in corpora to ob-
tain such semantic relations. Definition typologies
show that definitions can be introduced by differ-
ent semantic relations, some of these relations be-
ing likely to structure terminologies. Our aim is
therefore to mine “defining expressions” in domain-
specific corpora, and to detect the semantic rela-
tions they involve between their main terms. We
use lexico-syntactic markers and patterns to detect
at the same time both a definition and its main se-
mantic relation. 46 markers and 74 patterns have
been designed and tuned on a first corpus in the field
of anthropology. We report on their evaluation on a
second corpus in the field of dietetics, where they
obtained 4% to 36% recall and from 61 to 66% pre-
cision, and discuss the relative accuracy of different
subclasses of markers for this task.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.992174419753087">
A terminology is an artifact structuring terms ac-
cording to some semantic relations. Grabar and
Hamon (2004) present the different semantic rela-
tions likely to be found in terminologies. These
can be divided into lexical (synonymy), vertical
(hypernymy, meronymy) and transversal relations
(domain-specific relations). A study of definition
typologies, like the one of (Auger, 1997), shows
that these different relations are also present in def-
initions. We can then hypothesise that mining defi-
nitions along with the detection of their inherent se-
mantic relation can help to organise terms according
to the relations used in structured terminologies. We
focus in this paper on the detection of terms related
by hypernymy and synonymy in definitions.
The automatic detection of definitions can rely
on different types of existing works. We can, first,
consider the studies describing what definition is,
and more particularly what definition in corpus is
like. In this respect, we can cite the work of Trim-
ble (1985), Flowerdew (1992), Sager (2001) and
Meyer (2001). Another type of interesting exist-
ing work is about typologies of definitions: Mar-
tin (1983), Chukwu and Thoiron (1989) and Auger
(1997), amongst others, provide, in their classifica-
tions of definitions, linguistic clues to find defin-
ing statements in corpus. We propose to integrate
the typologies that we mention in section 2.2, along
with the linguistic clues they give: the definition
markers. And, at last, some works have already fo-
cused on mining definitions from corpora, including
Cartier (1997), Pearson (1996), Rebeyrolle (2000)
and Muresan and Klavans (2002), mostly through
the use of lexical definition markers. These works
provide us with methodological guidelines and an-
other set of lexical markers for our own experiment.
As (Pearson (1996); Rebeyrolle (2000)), our
method is based on lexico-syntactic patterns, so that
we can build on the work on French language by
Rebeyrolle (2000). We extended her work in two
respects: an analysis of the parenthesis as low-level
linguistic clue for definitions, and the concomitant
extraction of the semantic relation involved in a
“defining expression”, along with the extraction of
the definition itself. Previous works have, for in-
stance, mined definitions to find terms specific to a
particular domain of knowledge (Chukwu and Tho-
iron (1989)), and to describe their meaning (Rebey-
rolle, 2000); we focus on the detection of the seman-
tic relations between the main terms of a definition
in order to help a terminologist to build a structured
terminology following these relations.
We implemented an interface to visualise these
definitions and semantic relations extractions. We
tuned markers and patterns for extracting defini-
tions and semantic relations on a first corpus about
anthropology; we then tested the validity of these
markers and patterns on another corpus focused on
dietetics. The purpose of this test was, on the one
hand, to observe whether definitions were still cor-
rectly extracted on the basis of patterns trained on
a corpus differing in the domain of knowledge and
in the genre of documents involved, and, on the
56 CompuTerm 2004 - 3rd International Workshop on Computational Terminology
other hand, to detect if the semantic relation associ-
ated with each pattern was the same as the one ob-
served in the first corpus. The markers and patterns
showed to be comparable to the other experiments
mentioned in terms of definition extraction: the pre-
cision reached from 61 to 66%. As for the seman-
tic relation associated with the patterns, it obtained
different scores, depending on the marker. But, in
most cases, one main semantic relation is associ-
ated with a pattern in the scope of a single domain,
event though a few patterns convey the same rela-
tion across our two corpora.
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows: we first present previous work (section 2), de-
scribe our method and experiment (section 3), then
present and discuss results (section 4) and conclude
with directions for future work (section 5).

2.1 Description of definitions in corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849571428572">
As a first approach for detecting and extracting
defining statements in corpora, we have to... de-
fine this object. In the literature (Trimble (1985);
Flowerdew (1992),...), three categories of defini-
tions are often mentioned: the formal definition, the
semi-formal and the “non-formal” one. The formal
definition follows the Aristotelian schema: X = Y +
specific characteristics, where X is the defined term
(the “definiendum”), “=” means an equivalence re-
lation, Y stands for the generic class to which X
belongs (the “Genus”), and specific characteris-
tics detail in which respect X is different from the
other items composing the same generic class. A
semi-formal definition relates the definiendum only
with specific characteristics, or with its attribute(s)
(Meyer, 2001). Formal and semi-formal definitions
can be of simple type (expressed in one sentence),
or complex (expressed in two, or more sentences).
A non-formal definition aims “to define in a gen-
eral sense so that a reader can see the familiar el-
ement in whatever the new term may be” (Trimble,
1985). It can be an association with a synonym, a
paraphrase or grammatical derivation.
The common point between all these points of
views on the same linguistic object, or between all
these different objects sharing the same appellation
“definition”, is that they all follow the same didac-
tic purpose of disambiguating the meaning of a lex-
ical item, that is to distinguish it from the others in
the general language, or inside a specific vocabu-
lary. These definition descriptions present them as
the association between a term and its hypernym (its
“genus”), or between a term and its specific charac-
teristics. But there are yet other ways to express
definitions, as the works on their typology shows.

2.2 Typology of definitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851538461538">
Existing definitions typologies are all dedicated to
a specific purpose. We are particularly interested in
those which aim at eliciting linguistic clues that can
be used to mine defining contexts from corpora. We
work on French, for which Martin (1983) has classi-
fied dictionary definitions in order to give guidelines
for a consistent (electronic) dictionary. In the con-
text of corpus-based research, Chukwu and Thoiron
(1989) gave another classification, aiming at finding
domain-specific terms in corpora. A unified typol-
ogy is provided by Auger (1997), compiling both
cited typologies along with three others, and from
which we draw the following three categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9985495">
• Definitions expressed by “low level” linguistic
markers: punctuation clues such as parenthe-
sis, quote, dash, colon;
• Definitions expressed by lexical markers: lin-
guistic or metalinguistic lexical items;
• Definitions expressed by “high level” linguistic
markers: syntactic patterns such as anaphora or
apposition.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999828458333333">
The definitions introduced by lexical means are di-
vided in two branches, characterised by the lexi-
cal markers in table 1. We added elements from
other studies ((Rebeyrolle, 2000) and (Fuchs, 1994)
amongst others), and augmented this typology with
Definitions introduced by linguistic markers

Equivalence “equivalent to”

new markers, including some items introducing re-
formulation contexts (“that is”, “to say”, “for in-
stance”, ... ).
The Aristotelian definition type is presented here
as a “copulative” definition, as it is linguistically
marked by the copula “être” (to be). It involves a
hypernymic relation (and specific differences) to de-
scribe the meaning of a term, so we consider it as a
“hypernymic definition”. But we can see in table 1
that other semantic relations can also be used to de-
fine a term: synonymy (definition of “equivalence”
type), meronymy (“analysis” type), causality and
other domain-specific transversal relations (“func-
tion”, “characterisation” types). Mining a defini-
tion of “synonymic type” provides different denom-
inations for the same concept; one of “hypernymy
type” can help modelling the vertical structure be-
tween the “definiendum” and the first term of the
“definiens” (conceptual “father” and “son” associa-
tion); and definitions following transversal relations
allow the expression of specific knowledge. We fo-
cus in this paper on the extraction of definitions in-
volving hypernymy and synonymy, which are the
most generally considered relations in terminology
building.

2.3 Automatic definition mining
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968967213115">
Automatic definition mining from corpora can
be divided in different groups, according to the
methodologies followed. We will illustrate them by
describing three recent families of works: (i) Cartier
(1997), (ii) Pearson (1996) and Rebeyrolle (2000),
(iii) Muresan and Klavans (2002). They have
used respectively “contextual exploration”, lexico-
syntactic patterns and linguistic analysis and rules.
The former one extracts defining statements on
the basis of the match of linguistic clues, when they
are relayed in the sentence by some linguistic rules.
These rules are developped by the author, withing
the schema defined in the “contextual exploration”
methodology (Desclés, 1996).
Pearson (1996) and Rebeyrolle (2000) have fol-
lowed the methodology described by Hearst (1992),
up to now mainly applied to discover hyponymous
terms. It consists in describing the lexico-syntactic
context of an occurrence of a pair of terms known to
share a semantic relation. Modelling the context in
which they occur provides a “pattern” to apply to the
corpus, in order to extract other pairs of terms con-
nected by the same relation. Pearson and Rebeyrolle
have modelled lexico-syntactic contexts around lex-
ical clues interpreted as “definition markers”. Re-
beyrolle, working on French, evaluated the different
pattern types she modelled, across different corpora:
she obtained a precision range of 17.95 – 79.19%,
and a recall of 94.75 – 100%. The difference be-
tween the two numeric boundaries of the precision
range is due to the kind of markers involved in
the lexico-syntactic pattern evaluated: metalinguis-
tic markers obtained a high precision rate, but not
linguistic lexical markers.
The latter pair of authors have based their system
DEFINDER (http://www1.cs.columbia.
edu/~smara/DEFINDER/) on the lexical and
syntactic analysis of a medical corpus, with semi-
automatic definition acquisition. Their evaluation
is focused on the usefulness of the system, as
compared with existing specialised medical dictio-
naries. They reach a 86.95% precision and 75.47%
recall, following their evaluation methodology.
We chose to follow the first methodology in our
experiment (see section 3), in which we additionally
explore definition mining in some cases where the
definition is not introduced by lexical items. Fol-
lowing this methodology enables us to build on ex-
isting work dedicated to French, which showed to
be interesting and efficient. The lexico-syntactic
pattern methodology also enables us to access the
different linguistic elements we were interested in
mining: the definition itself, the main terms of the
definition and the semantic relation between them.
We focus this experimentation more particularly
on identifying the semantic relations of synonymy
and hypernymy involved in the different definitions
likely to be found in corpora. We aim at testing
whether a stable link can be established between the
definition extraction pattern and a specific semantic
relation.

3 Detecting Semantic Relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999895">
Our goal is to automatically detect some of the se-
mantic relations that might be found in definitions
and to propose them to a human validator in charge
of structuring a terminology. We focus on hyper-
nymy and synonymy, which are the most classical
relations found in terminology. If the relation is
hypernymy, the terms are to be modelled in a hi-
erarchical way, if it is synonymy, both terms can
be used to express the same concept. The rela-
tions and the definitions are extracted together from
corpora, by the same lexico-syntactic patterns. We
present in the next subsections our two corpora (sec-
tion 3.1), then the lexico-syntactic patterns we used
(section 3.2) and their experimental evaluation (sec-
tion 3.3): we analyse whether a relation found in
connection with a lexico-syntactic pattern in the
training corpus can be unchanged in the context of
the same lexico-syntactic pattern, when applied to a

3.1 Description and preparation of the corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949409090909">
Our training corpus (76 Kwords) is focused on
childhood, from the point of view of anthropolo-
gists. It is composed of different genres of docu-
ments (documentary descriptions, thesis report ex-
tracts, Web documents). Documentary descriptions
were humanly collected, whereas electronic doc-
uments were automatically collected from Inter-
net via the tools of (Grabar and Berland, 2001).
Our evaluation corpus (480 Kwords), in the do-
main of dietetics, is composed of Web documents
indexed by the CISMeF quality-controlled cata-
log of French medical Web sites (http://www.
chu-rouen.fr/cismef/) in the subtrees “Di-
etetics” and “Nutrition” of the MeSH thesaurus.
It is mainly composed of medical courses and
Web pages presenting information about nutri-
tion in different medical contexts. Both cor-
pora were morpho-syntactically analysed by Cor-
dial Analyser (Synapse Developpement, http://
www.synapse-fr.com/). Cordial tags, lem-
matises and parses a corpus, yielding grammatical
functions (subject, object, ...) between chunks.

3.2 Lexico-syntactic patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998536857142857">
A given linguistic marker (see, e.g., table 1) can oc-
cur in different contexts, some of which are defini-
tions, and can be a clue for different semantic rela-
tions. Lexico-syntactic patterns aim at reducing this
ambiguity by specifying more restricted contexts in
which a definition is found, and, furthermore, in
which one specific semantic relation is involved.
Unlike (Hearst, 1992), we started the pattern de-
sign by analysing marker occurrences in our train-
ing corpus. We designed and tuned our lexico-
syntactic patterns on this corpus, patterns dedicated
to the extraction of definitions and specific relations:
hypernymy and synonymy. Our patterns use the in-
formation output by the parser, including lemma,
morpho-syntactic category and grammatical func-
tion. For instance: “N (N)” specifies that the marker
“(” has to be preceded by a noun, and immediately
followed by a single common noun, followed by a
closing parenthesis. In this specific case, “(” intro-
duces a hypernymic definition.
Each pattern drives different kinds of processing:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.985016">
• extraction of the defining sentence on the basis
of the whole pattern;
• selection of one “preferred” relation associated
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9695307">
with the specific pattern, among the set of pos-
sible relations associated with the marker; this
relation stands between the interdefined terms
of the definition;
• extraction of the interdefined terms following
two strategies (contextual or based on depen-
dencies around the marker), depending on the
morphosyntactic category of the marker. When
the marker is a punctuation or a noun, we usu-
ally extract its left and right syntactic contexts1
(roughly the first chunk before the marker, and
the first chunk after the marker in the sen-
tence). When the marker is a verb, we extract
its subject and object if they exist in the sen-
tence, otherwise we extract its left and right
chunks, as in the previous case.
Our patterns are implemented in XSLT and the re-
sulting extractions are shown to a human validator
through a Web interface (figure 1): an HTML form
allowing the validator to complete and correct the
extractions. It is possible for the validator to correct
the terms extracted from the definition, in particu-
lar because the chunk often includes punctuation,
which is usually not considered as part of the term,
and it is possible to select a different semantic rela-
tion than the one proposed when it happens not to
be the correct one. A combo box shows all the pos-
sible relations related to the marker involved in the
lexico-syntactic pattern which provided the extrac-
tion of the defining sentence.

3.3 Experimental setup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999485">
We tuned our lexico-syntactic patterns to extract
definitions from the test corpus. We associated
with each pattern a “preferential” semantic relation,
which human corpus analysis showed to be the more
likely to be connected to the definitions extracted by
the means of this pattern. The aim of the experiment
is to test the stability of this connection, by applying
the patterns to the evaluation corpus.
A random sample of the test corpus (13 texts
among 132) was manually processed to tag its def-
initions, in order to have a standard measure for
the evaluation of recall. Table 2 shows the number
of definitions of synonymic and hypernymic types
found in that sample, and provides the percentages
of these definitions among all the different kinds of
tagged definitions (“% definitions”) in that sample.
Some definitions involved more than one semantic
relation, so we also present the percentage of hyper-
nymic and synonymic relations among all the se-
mantic relations (“% relations”).

Definitions retrieved with the hypernymy patterns
involved very generic markers, and they introduced
a number of other semantic relations. The pattern
around “for instance”, for which 16 extracted sen-
tences out of 95 were not definitions, can still be
specified to discriminate defining contexts from oth-
ers. We can notice, though, that it is one of the
most productive patterns (95 extractions) and that it
reaches a 47,3% precision. But the patterns around
the parenthesis show that the same syntactic con-
text can introduce different kinds of relations: in
this case, the lexico-syntactic pattern cannot disam-
biguate the relation any further. The pattern “N
(N)” introduced “hypernymic definitions”, as well
as “synonymic” or “meronymic” ones, the same
syntactic context being even likely to be interpreted
as a transversal relation between a treatment and a
disease, for instance. It is the sentence as a whole
that has to be interpreted in order to be able to define
the relevant semantic relation between the terms in
that syntactic context.
Some linguistic markers (as “comme”) are re-
liable for detecting a semantic relation: 9 sen-
tences out of 13 were “synonymic definitions”.
But surprisingly enough, some metalinguistic verbs
(“définir”, for instance) were not as effective as
them in that purpose. “Définir” introduced only
22 “synonymic definitions” out of 68 sentences re-
trieved. One could think that a verb with metalin-
guistic function could be less polysemic than an-
other of more “generic purpose”. This naive hope
happens to be wrong: “Définir” means “to fix
(a limit)” as often as “to define”. Some markers
steadily introduced a semantic relation, but not the
one they were supposed to: this variation is prob-
ably due to the change in domains across our two
corpora. And some patterns obviously introduced a
definition, but the defined element was in the previ-
ous sentence (this is the case of 92 extractions with
patterns involving the marker “Il s’agit de”). As our
system, up to now, extracts only one sentence, we
could not determine whether the semantic relation
was the one expected. We must address this prob-
lem, and we can hope that the precision rate will
then be better than the one presented here: some
sentences for which we could not interpret the se-
mantic relation might convey the one we expected.
The best precision score is reached by patterns in-
volving two markers: a metalinguistic noun associ-
ated with a metalinguistic verb. In a more general
way, analysing the defining sentences extracted, we
could see that sentences that were the “best” defi-
nitions (the closest to dictionary definitions) often
cluded this paradigm context in the “Other” column.

Our experiment tried to link the semantic relation
inherent to different kinds of definitions with the
marker (the heart of our lexico-syntactic patterns)
and more specifically with the lexico-syntactic pat-
terns at the origin of the extraction of the definition
itself. Having a close look at some of the mark-
ers, we can observe that some linguistic items can
be very reliable markers for definition extraction as-
sociated with a semantic relation. We can also find
out that the polysemy of some markers is related
to the domain of the corpus. In that respect, the
reusability of the lexico-syntactic patterns is limited
to a set of markers which were found to be reli-
able across our two corpora. What is more prob-
lematic is the fact that it is sometimes not possible
to make a specific distinction between different se-
mantic relations detected with the same marker in
the context of definitions sharing most of their syn-
tactic contexts. But most of the patterns retrieve a
good rate of defining sentences, some patterns be-
ing more reliable than others; and the more numer-
ous the markers involved, the more likely it is that
we have a definition. And usually these patterns re-
trieve definitions following one main semantic rela-
tion (this is not the case however for parenthesis and
the patterns involving the marker “à savoir”). This
leads to the hypothesis that if lexico-syntactic pat-
terns may not be used to propose semantic relations
that are valid across different domains, they remain
a good clue for mining definitions, especially defini-

Definition typologies show that definitions can be introduced by different semantic relations, some of these relations being likely to structure terminologies. Our aim is therefore to mine “defining expressions” in domainspecific corpora, and to detect the semantic relations they involve between their main terms. We use lexico-syntactic markers and patterns to detect at the same time both a definition and its main semantic relation. 46 markers and 74 patterns have been designed and tuned on a first corpus in the field of anthropology. We report on their evaluation on a second corpus in the field of dietetics, where they obtained 4% to 36% recall and from 61 to 66% precision, and discuss the relative accuracy of different subclasses of markers for this task.</abstract>

Grabar and Hamon (2004) present the different semantic relations likely to be found in terminologies. These can be divided into lexical (synonymy), vertical (hypernymy, meronymy) and transversal relations (domain-specific relations). A study of definition typologies, like the one of (Auger, 1997), shows that these different relations are also present in definitions. We can then hypothesise that mining definitions along with the detection of their inherent semantic relation can help to organise terms according to the relations used in structured terminologies. We focus in this paper on the detection of terms related by hypernymy and synonymy in definitions. The automatic detection of definitions can rely on different types of existing works. We can, first, consider the studies describing what definition is, and more particularly what definition in corpus is like. In this respect, we ca</context>

We are particularly interested in those which aim at eliciting linguistic clues that can be used to mine defining contexts from corpora. We work on French, for which Martin (1983) has classified dictionary definitions in order to give guidelines for a consistent (electronic) dictionary. In the context of corpus-based research, Chukwu and Thoiron (1989) gave another classification, aiming at finding domain-specific terms in corpora. A unified typology is provided by Auger (1997), compiling both cited typologies along with three others, and from which we draw the following three categories: • Definitions expressed by “low level” linguistic markers: punctuation clues such as parenthesis, quote, dash, colon; • Definitions expressed by lexical markers: linguistic or metalinguistic lexical items; • Definitions expressed by “high level” linguistic markers: syntactic patterns such as anaphora or apposition. The definitions introduced by lexical means are divided in two branches, characterised by the lexical markers in table 1. We added elements from other studies ((Rebeyrol</context>

These works provide us with methodological guidelines and another set of lexical markers for our own experiment. As (Pearson (1996); Rebeyrolle (2000)), our method is based on lexico-syntactic patterns, so that we can build on the work on French language by Rebeyrolle (2000). We extended her work in two respects: an analysis of the parenthesis as low-level linguistic clue for definitions, and the concomitant extraction of the semantic relation involved in a “defining expres</context>

We focus in this paper on the extraction of definitions involving hypernymy and synonymy, which are the most generally considered relations in terminology building. 2.3 Automatic definition mining Automatic definition mining from corpora can be divided in different groups, according to the methodologies followed. We will illustrate them by describing three recent families of works: (i) Cartier (1997), (ii) Pearson (1996) and Rebeyrolle (2000), (iii) Muresan and Klavans (2002). They have used respectively “contextual exploration”, lexicosyntactic patterns and linguistic analysis and rules. The former one extracts defining statements on the basis of the match of linguistic clues, when they are relayed in the sentence by some linguistic rules. These rules are developped by the author, withing the schema defined in the “contextual exploration” methodology (Desclés, 1996). Pearson (1996) and Rebeyrolle (2000) have followed the methodology described by Hearst (1992), up to now mainly applied to</context>

In the literature (Trimble (1985); Flowerdew (1992),...), three categories of definitions are often mentioned: the formal definition, the semi-formal and the “non-formal” one. The formal definition follows the Aristotelian schema: X = Y + specific characteristics, where X is the defined term (the “definiendum”), “=” means an equivalence relation, Y stands for the generic class to which X belongs (the “Genus”), and specific characteristics detail in which respect X is different from the other items composing the same generic class.

A study of definition typologies, like the one of (Auger, 1997), shows that these different relations are also present in definitions. We can then hypothesise that mining definitions along with the detection of their inherent semantic relation can help to organise terms according to the relations used in structured terminologies.

Pearson (1996) and Rebeyrolle (2000) have followed the methodology described by Hearst (1992), up to now mainly applied to discover hyponymous terms. It consists in describing the lexico-syntactic context of an occurrence of a pair of terms known to share a semantic relation. Modelling the context in which they occur provides a “pattern” to apply to the corpus, in order to extract other pairs of terms connected by the same relation. Pearson and Rebeyrolle have modelled lexico-syntactic contexts around lexical clues interpreted as “definition markers”. Rebeyrolle, working on French, evaluated the different pattern types she modelled, across different corpora: she obtained a precision r</context>

Cordial tags, lemmatises and parses a corpus, yielding grammatical functions (subject, object, ...) between chunks. 3.2 Lexico-syntactic patterns A given linguistic marker (see, e.g., table 1) can occur in different contexts, some of which are definitions, and can be a clue for different semantic relations. Lexico-syntactic patterns aim at reducing this ambiguity by specifying more restricted contexts in which a definition is found, and, furthermore, in which one specific semantic relation is involved. Unlike (Hearst, 1992), we started the pattern design by analysing marker occurrences in our training corpus. We designed and tuned our lexicosyntactic patterns on this corpus, patterns dedicated to the extraction of definitions and specific relations: hypernymy and synonymy. Our patterns use the information output by the parser, including lemma, morpho-syntactic category and grammatical function. For instance: “N (N)” specifies that the marker “(” has to be preceded by a noun, and immediately followed by a single common noun, followed by a closing parenthesis. In this specific case, “(” introduces a hypernymic def</context>

These definition descriptions present them as the association between a term and its hypernym (its “genus”), or between a term and its specific characteristics. But there are yet other ways to express definitions, as the works on their typology shows. 2.2 Typology of definitions Existing definitions typologies are all dedicated to a specific purpose. We are particularly interested in those which aim at eliciting linguistic clues that can be used to mine defining contexts from corpora. We work on French, for which Martin (1983) has classified dictionary definitions in order to give guidelines for a consistent (electronic) dictionary. In the context of corpus-based research, Chukwu and Thoiron (1989) gave another classification, aiming at finding domain-specific terms in corpora. A unified typology is provided by Auger (1997), compiling both cited typologies along with three others, and from which we draw the following three categories: • Definitions expressed by “low level” linguistic markers: punctuation clues such as parenthesis, quote, dash, colon; • Definitions expressed by lexical markers: linguistic or metalin</context>

A semi-formal definition relates the definiendum only with specific characteristics, or with its attribute(s) (Meyer, 2001). Formal and semi-formal definitions can be of simple type (expressed in one sentence), or complex (expressed in two, or more sentences). A non-formal definition aims “to define in a general sense so that a reader can see the familiar element in whatever the new term may be” (Trimble, 1985). It can be an association with a synonym, a paraphrase or grammatical derivation. The common point between all these points of views on the same linguistic object, or between all these different objects sharing the same appellation “definition”, is that they all follow the same didactic purpose of disambigu</context>
