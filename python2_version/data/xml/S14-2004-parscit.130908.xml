Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999749294117647">
Sentiment analysis is increasingly viewed
as a vital task both from an academic and
a commercial standpoint. The majority of
current approaches, however, attempt to
detect the overall polarity of a sentence,
paragraph, or text span, irrespective of the
entities mentioned (e.g., laptops) and their
aspects (e.g., battery, screen). SemEval-
2014 Task 4 aimed to foster research in the
field of aspect-based sentiment analysis,
where the goal is to identify the aspects
of given target entities and the sentiment
expressed for each aspect. The task pro-
vided datasets containing manually anno-
tated reviews of restaurants and laptops, as
well as a common evaluation procedure. It
attracted 163 submissions from 32 teams.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.957727962264151">
With the proliferation of user-generated content on
the web, interest in mining sentiment and opinions
in text has grown rapidly, both in academia and
business. Early work in sentiment analysis mainly
aimed to detect the overall polarity (e.g., positive
or negative) of a given text or text span (Pang et
al., 2002; Turney, 2002). However, the need for a
more fine-grained approach, such as aspect-based
(or ‘feature-based’) sentiment analysis (ABSA),
soon became apparent (Liu, 2012). For example,
laptop reviews not only express the overall senti-
ment about a specific model (e.g., “This is a great

tribution 4.0 International Licence. Page numbers and pro-

laptop”), but also sentiments relating to its spe-
cific aspects, such as the hardware, software, price,
etc. Subsequently, a review may convey opposing
sentiments (e.g., “Its performance is ideal, I wish
I could say the same about the price”) or objective
information (e.g., “This one still has the CD slot”)
for different aspects of an entity.
ABSA is critical in mining and summarizing
opinions from on-line reviews (Gamon et al.,
2005; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Hu and Liu,
2004a; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005). In this set-
ting, ABSA aims to identify the aspects of the en-
tities being reviewed and to determine the senti-
ment the reviewers express for each aspect. Within
the last decade, several ABSA systems of this kind
have been developed for movie reviews (Thet et
al., 2010), customer reviews of electronic products
like digital cameras (Hu and Liu, 2004a) or net-
book computers (Brody and Elhadad, 2010), ser-
vices (Long et al., 2010), and restaurants (Ganu et
al., 2009; Brody and Elhadad, 2010).
Previous publicly available ABSA benchmark
datasets adopt different annotation schemes within
different tasks. The restaurant reviews dataset of
Ganu et al. (2009) uses six coarse-grained aspects
(e.g., FOOD, PRICE, SERVICE) and four overall
sentence polarity labels (positive, negative, con-
flict, neutral). Each sentence is assigned one or
more aspects together with a polarity label for
each aspect; for example, “The restaurant was ex-
pensive, but the menu was great.” would be as-
signed the aspect PRICE with negative polarity and
FOOD with positive polarity. In the product re-
views dataset of Hu and Liu (2004a; 2004b), as-
pect terms, i.e., terms naming aspects (e.g., ‘ra-
dio’, ‘voice dialing’) together with strength scores
(e.g., ‘radio’: +2, ‘voice dialing’: −3) are pro-

vided. No predefined inventory of aspects is pro-
vided, unlike the dataset of Ganu et al.
The SemEval-2014 ABSA Task is based on lap-
top and restaurant reviews and consists of four
subtasks (see Section 2). Participants were free to
participate in a subset of subtasks and the domains
(laptops or restaurants) of their choice.
</bodyText>

2 Task Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999761581818182">
For the first two subtasks (SB1, SB2), datasets on
both domains (restaurants, laptops) were provided.
For the last two subtasks (SB3, SB4), datasets only
for the restaurant reviews were provided.
Aspect term extraction (SB1): Given a set of
review sentences, the task is to identify all as-
pect terms present in each sentence (e.g., ‘wine’,
‘waiter’, ‘appetizer’, ‘price’, ‘food’). We require
all the aspect terms to be identified, including as-
pect terms for which no sentiment is expressed
(neutral polarity). These will be useful for con-
structing an ontology of aspect terms and to iden-
tify frequently discussed aspects.
Aspect term polarity (SB2): In this subtask,
we assume that the aspect terms are given (as de-
scribed in SB1) and the task is to determine the po-
larity of each aspect term (positive, negative, con-
flict, or neutral). The conflict label applies when
both positive and negative sentiment is expressed
about an aspect term (e.g., “Certainly not the best
sushi in New York, however, it is always fresh”).
An alternative would have been to tag the aspect
term in these cases with the dominant polarity, but
this in turn would be difficult to agree on.
Aspect category detection (SB3): Given a
predefined set of aspect categories (e.g., PRICE,
FOOD) and a set of review sentences (but without
any annotations of aspect terms and their polari-
ties), the task is to identify the aspect categories
discussed in each sentence. Aspect categories are
typically coarser than the aspect terms as defined
in SB1, and they do not necessarily occur as terms
in the sentences. For example, in “Delicious but
expensive”, the aspect categories FOOD and PRICE
are not instantiated through specific aspect terms,
but are only inferred through the adjectives ‘deli-
cious’ and ‘expensive’. SB1 and SB3 were treated
as separate subtasks, thus no information linking
aspect terms to aspect categories was provided.
Aspect category polarity (SB4): For this sub-
task, aspect categories for each review sentence
are provided. The goal is to determine the polar-
ity (positive, negative, conflict, or neutral) of each
aspect category discussed in each sentence.
Subtasks SB1 and SB2 are useful in cases where
no predefined inventory of aspect categories is
available. In these cases, frequently discussed as-
pect terms of the entity can be identified together
with their overall sentiment polarities. We hope to
include an additional aspect term aggregation sub-
task in future (Pavlopoulos and Androutsopoulos,
2014b) to cluster near-synonymous (e.g., ‘money’,
‘price’, ‘cost’) or related aspect terms (e.g., ‘de-
sign’, ‘color’, ‘feeling’) together with their aver-
aged sentiment scores as shown in Fig. 1.

sentiment polarities for a target entity.
Subtasks SB3 and SB4 are useful when a pre-
defined inventory of (coarse) aspect categories is
available. A table like the one of Fig. 1 can then
also be generated, but this time using the most
frequent aspect categories to label the rows, with
stars showing the proportion of reviews express-
ing positive vs. negative opinions for each aspect
category.

3.2 Annotation Process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998789555555556">
For a given target entity (a restaurant or a lap-
top) being reviewed, the annotators were asked to
provide two types of information: aspect terms
(SB1) and aspect term polarities (SB2). For the
restaurants dataset, two additional annotation lay-
ers were added: aspect category (SB3) and aspect
category polarity (SB4).
The annotators used BRAT (Stenetorp et al.,
2012), a web-based annotation tool, which was
configured appropriately for the needs of the
ABSA task.1 Figure 2 shows an annotated sen-
tence in BRAT, as viewed by the annotators.
Stage 1: Aspect terms and polarities. During
a first annotation stage, the annotators tagged all
the single or multiword terms that named par-
ticular aspects of the target entity (e.g., “I liked
the service and the staff, but not the food” →
{‘service’, ‘staff’, ‘food’}, “The hard disk is very
noisy” → {‘hard disk’}). They were asked to tag
only aspect terms explicitly naming particular as-
pects (e.g., “everything about it” or “it’s expen-
sive” do not name particular aspects). The as-
pect terms were annotated as they appeared, even
if misspelled (e.g., ‘warrenty’ instead of ‘war-
ranty’). Each identified aspect term also had to be
assigned a polarity label (positive, negative, neu-
tral, conflict). For example, “I hated their fajitas,
but their salads were great” → {‘fajitas’: nega-
tive, ‘salads’: positive}, “The hard disk is very
noisy” → {‘hard disk’: negative}.
Each sentence of the two datasets was anno-
tated by two annotators, a graduate student (an-
notator A) and an expert linguist (annotator B).
Initially, two subsets of sentences (300 from each
dataset) were tagged by annotator A and the anno-
tations were inspected and validated by annotator

B. The disagreements between the two annotators
were confined to borderline cases. Taking into ac-
count the types of these disagreements (discussed
below), annotator A was provided with additional
guidelines and tagged the remainder of the sen-
tences in both datasets.2 When A was not confi-
dent, a decision was made collaboratively with B.
When A and B disagreed, a decision was made
collaboratively by them and a third expert annota-
tor. Most disagreements fall into one of the fol-
lowing three types:
Polarity ambiguity: In several sentences, it was
unclear if the reviewer expressed positive or neg-
ative opinion, or no opinion at all (just reporting
a fact), due to lack of context. For example, in
“12.44 seconds boot time” it is unclear if the re-
viewer expresses a positive, negative, or no opin-
ion about the aspect term ‘boot time’. In future
challenges, it would be better to allow the annota-
tors (and the participating systems) to consider the
entire review instead of each sentence in isolation.
Multi-word aspect term boundaries: In sev-
eral cases, the annotators disagreed on the exact
boundaries of multi-word aspect terms when they
appeared in conjunctions or disjunctions (e.g.,
“selection of meats and seafoods”, “noodle and
rices dishes”, “school or office use”). In such
cases, we asked the annotators to tag as a sin-
gle aspect term the maximal noun phrase (the en-
tire conjunction or disjunction). Other disagree-
ments concerned the extent of the aspect terms
when adjectives that may or may not have a sub-
jective meaning were also present. For example,
if ‘large’ in “large whole shrimp” is part of the
dish name, then the guidelines require the adjec-
tive to be included in the aspect term; otherwise
(e.g., in “large portions”) ‘large’ is a subjectivity
indicator not to be included in the aspect term. De-
spite the guidelines, in some cases it was difficult
to isolate and tag the exact aspect term, because of
intervening words, punctuation, or long-term de-
pendencies.
Aspect term vs. reference to target entity: In
some cases, it was unclear if a noun or noun phrase
was used as the aspect term or if it referred to the
entity being reviewed as whole. In “This place
is awesome”, for example, ‘place’ most probably
refers to the restaurant as a whole (hence, it should
not be tagged as an aspect term), but in “Cozy

place and good pizza” it probably refers to the am-
bience of the restaurant. A broader context would
again help in some of these cases.
We note that laptop reviews often evaluate each
laptop as a whole, rather than expressing opinions
about particular aspects. Furthermore, when they
express opinions about particular aspects, they of-
ten do so by using adjectives that refer implicitly
to aspects (e.g., ‘expensive’, ‘heavy’), rather than
using explicit aspect terms (e.g., ‘cost’, ‘weight’);
the annotators were instructed to tag only explicit
aspect terms, not adjectives implicitly referring to
aspects. By contrast, restaurant reviews contain
many more aspect terms (Table 2, last column).3

<bodyText confidence="0.996423875">
Another difference between the two datasets
is that the neutral class is much more frequent
in (the aspect terms of) laptops, since laptop re-
views often mention features without expressing
any (clear) sentiment (e.g., “the latest version does
not have a disc drive”). Nevertheless, the positive
class is the majority in both datasets, but it is much
more frequent in restaurants (Table 2). The ma-
jority of the aspect terms are single-words in both
datasets (2148 in laptops, 4827 in restaurants, out
of 3012 and 4827 total aspect terms, respectively).
Stage 2: Aspect categories and polarities. In
this task, each sentence needs to be tagged with
the aspect categories discussed in the sentence.
The aspect categories are FOOD, SERVICE, PRICE,
AMBIENCE (the atmosphere and environment of

a restaurant), and ANECDOTES/MISCELLANEOUS
(sentences not belonging in any of the previous
aspect categories). 4 For example, “The restau-
rant was expensive, but the menu was great” is
assigned the aspect categories PRICE and FOOD.
Additionally, a polarity (positive, negative, con-
flict, neutral) for each aspect category should be
provided (e.g., “The restaurant was expensive, but
the menu was great” → {PRICE: negative, FOOD:
positive}.
One annotator validated the existing aspect cat-
egory annotations of the corpus of Ganu et al.
(2009). The agreement with the existing anno-
tations was 92% measured as average Fl. Most
disagreements concerned additions of missing as-
pect category annotations. Furthermore, the same
annotator validated and corrected (if needed) the
existing polarity labels per aspect category anno-
tation. The agreement for the polarity labels was
87% in terms of accuracy and it was measured
only on the common aspect category annotations.
The additional 800 sentences (not present in Ganu
et al.’s dataset) were used for testing and were an-
notated from scratch in the same manner. The dis-
tribution of the polarity classes per category is pre-
sented in Table 3. Again, ‘positive’ is the majority
polarity class while the dominant aspect category
is FOOD in both the training and test restaurant
sentences.
Determining the aspect categories of the sen-
tences and their polarities (Stage 2) was an easier
task compared to detecting aspect terms and their
polarities (Stage 1). The annotators needed less
time in Stage 2 and it was easier to reach agree-
ment. Exceptions were some sentences where it
was difficult to decide if the categories AMBIENCE
or ANECDOTES/MISCELLANEOUS applied (e.g.,
“One of my Fav spots in the city”). We instructed
the annotators to classify those sentences only in
ANECDOTES/MISCELLANEOUS, if they conveyed

The evaluation of the ABSA task ran in two
phases. In Phase A, the participants were asked
to return the aspect terms (SB1) and aspect cate-
gories (SB3) for the provided test datasets. Subse-
quently, in Phase B, the participants were given
the gold aspect terms and aspect categories (as
in Fig. 3) for the sentences of Phase A and they
were asked to return the polarities of the aspect
terms (SB2) and the polarities of the aspect cate-
gories of each sentence (SB4).6 Each participat-
ing team was allowed to submit up to two runs
per subtask and domain (restaurants, laptops) in
each phase; one constrained (C), where only the
provided training data and other resources (e.g.,
publicly available lexica) excluding additional an-
notated sentences could be used, and one uncon-
strained (U), where additional data of any kind
could be used for training. In the latter case, the
teams had to report the resources they used.

Aspect term extraction (SB1) baseline: A se-
quence of tokens is tagged as an aspect term in
a test sentence (of a domain), if it is listed in a
dictionary that contains all the aspect terms of the
training sentences (of the same domain).
Aspect term polarity (SB2) baseline: For each
aspect term t in a test sentence s (of a particu-
lar domain), this baseline checks if t had been
encountered in the training sentences (of the do-
main). If so, it retrieves the k most similar to s
training sentences (of the domain), and assigns to
the aspect term t the most frequent polarity it had
in the k sentences. Otherwise, if t had not been en-
countered in the training sentences, it is assigned
the most frequent aspect term polarity label of the

Aspect category extraction (SB3) baseline: For
every test sentence s, the k most similar to s train-
ing sentences are retrieved (as in the SB2 base-
line). Then, s is assigned the m most frequent as-
pect category labels of the k retrieved sentences;
m is the most frequent number of aspect category
labels per sentence among the k sentences.
Aspect category polarity (SB4): This baseline
assigns to each aspect category c of a test sentence
s the most frequent polarity label that c had in the
k most similar to s training sentences (of the same
domain), considering only training sentences that
have the aspect category label c. Sentence similar-
ity is computed as in the SB2 baseline.
For subtasks SB2 and SB4, we also use a major-
ity baseline that assigns the most frequent polarity
(in the training data) to all the aspect terms and as-
pect categories. The scores of all the baselines and
systems are presented in Tables 4–6.

The ABSA task attracted 32 teams in total and 165
submissions (systems), 76 for phase A and 89 for
phase B. Based on the human-annotation experi-
ence, the expectations were that systems would
perform better in Phase B (SB3, SB4, involving
aspect categories) than in Phase A (SB1, SB2, in-
volving aspect terms). The evaluation results con-
firmed our expectations (Tables 4–6).

Overall, the systems achieved significantly
higher scores (+10%) in the restaurants domain,
compared to laptops. The best F1 score (74.55%)
for laptops was achieved by the IHS RD. team,
which relied on Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
with features extracted using named entity recog-
nition, POS tagging, parsing, and semantic anal-
ysis. The IHS RD. team used additional reviews
from Amazon and Epinions (without annotated
terms) to learn the sentiment orientation of words
and they trained their CRF on the union of the
restaurant and laptop training data that we pro-
vided; the same trained CRF classifier was then
used in both domains.
The second system, the unconstrained system of
DLIREC, also uses a CRF, along with POS and
dependency tree based features. It also uses fea-
tures derived from the aspect terms of the train-
ing data and clusters created from additional re-
views from YELP and Amazon. In the restaurants
domain, the unconstrained system of DLIREC
ranked first with an F1 of 84.01%, but the best
unconstrained system, that of XRCE, was very
close (83.98%). The XRCE system relies on a
parser to extract syntactic/semantic dependencies
(e.g., ‘dissapointed’–‘food’). For aspect term ex-
traction, the parser’s vocabulary was enriched with
the aspect terms of the training data and a term
list extracted from Wikipedia and Wordnet. A set
of grammar rules was also added to detect multi-
word terms and associate them with the corre-
sponding aspect category (e.g., FOOD, PRICE).
The aspect category extraction subtask (SB3)
attracted 18 teams. As shown in Table 5, the best
score was achieved by the system of NRC-Canada
(88.57%), which relied on five binary (one-vs-all)
SVMs, one for each aspect category. The SVMs
used features based on various types of n-grams
(e.g., stemmed) and information from a lexicon
learnt from YELP data, which associates aspect
terms with aspect categories. The latter lexicon
significantly improved F1. The constrained UN-
ITOR system uses five SVMs with bag-of-words
(BoW) features, which in the unconstrained sub-
mission are generalized using distributional vec-
tors learnt from Opinosis and TripAdvisor data.
Similarly, UWB uses a binary MaxEnt classifier
for each aspect category with BoW and TF-IDF
features. The unconstrained submission of UWB
also uses word clusters learnt using various meth-
ods (e.g., LDA); additional features indicate which
clusters the words of the sentence being classi-
fied come from. XRCE uses information identi-
fied by its syntactic parser as well as BoW features
to train a logistic regression model that assigns to
the sentence probabilities of belonging to each as-
pect category. A probability threshold, tuned on
the training data, is then used to determine which
categories will be assigned to the sentence.

The aspect term polarity detection subtask (SB2)
attracted 26 teams for the laptops dataset and 26
teams for the restaurants dataset. DCU and NRC-
Canada had the best systems in both domains (Ta-
ble 6). Their scores on the laptops dataset were
identical (70.48%). On the laptops dataset, the
DCU system performed slightly better (80.95%
vs. 80.15%). For SB2, both NRC-Canada and
DCU relied on an SVM classifier with features

mainly based on n-grams, parse trees, and sev-
eral out-of-domain, publicly available sentiment
lexica (e.g., MPQA, SentiWordnet and Bing Liu’s
Opinion Lexicon). NRC-Canada also used two
automatically compiled polarity lexica for restau-
rants and laptops, obtained from YELP and Ama-
zon data, respectively. Furthermore, NRC-Canada
showed by ablation experiments that the most use-
ful features are those derived from the sentiment
lexica. On the other hand, DCU used only publicly
available lexica, which were manually adapted by
filtering words that do not express sentiment in
laptop and restaurant reviews (e.g., ‘really’) and
by adding others that were missing and do express
sentiment (e.g., ‘mouthwatering’).
The aspect category polarity detection subtask
(SB4) attracted 20 teams. NRC-Canada again had
the best score (82.92%) using an SVM classifier.
The same feature set as in SB2 was used, but it
was further enriched to capture information re-
lated to each specific aspect category. The second
team, XRCE, used information from its syntactic
parser, BoW features, and an out-of-domain senti-
ment lexicon to train an SVM model that predicts
the polarity of each given aspect category.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983375">
We provided an overview of Task 4 of SemEval-
2014. The task aimed to foster research in aspect-
based sentiment analysis (ABSA). We constructed
and released ABSA benchmark datasets contain-
ing manually annotated reviews from two domains
(restaurants, laptops). The task attracted 163 sub-
missions from 32 teams that were evaluated in four
subtasks centered around aspect terms (detecting
aspect terms and their polarities) and coarser as-
pect categories (assigning aspect categories and
aspect category polarities to sentences). The task
will be repeated in SemEval-2015 with additional
datasets and a domain-adaptation subtask.8 In the
future, we hope to add an aspect term aggrega-
tion subtask (Pavlopoulos and Androutsopoulos,
2014a).

<abstract confidence="0.995325055555556">Sentiment analysis is increasingly viewed as a vital task both from an academic and a commercial standpoint. The majority of current approaches, however, attempt to detect the overall polarity of a sentence, paragraph, or text span, irrespective of the entities mentioned (e.g., laptops) and their aspects (e.g., battery, screen). SemEval- 2014 Task 4 aimed to foster research in the field of aspect-based sentiment analysis, where the goal is to identify the aspects of given target entities and the sentiment expressed for each aspect. The task provided datasets containing manually annotated reviews of restaurants and laptops, as well as a common evaluation procedure. It attracted 163 submissions from 32 teams.</abstract>

The restaurants training data, consisting of 3041 English sentences, is a subset of the dataset from Ganu et al. (2009), which included annotations for coarse aspect categories (as in SB3) and overall sentence polarities. We added annotations for aspect terms occurring in the sentences (SB1), aspect term polarities (SB2), and aspect category polarities (SB4). Additional restaurant reviews were collected and annotated (from scratch) in the same manner and used as test data (800 sentences). The laptops dataset contains 3845 English 28 sentences extracted from laptop custumer reviews. Human annotators tagged the aspect terms (SB1) and their polarities (SB2); 3045 sentences were used for training and 800 for testi</context>

Additionally, a polarity (positive, negative, conflict, neutral) for each aspect category should be provided (e.g., “The restaurant was expensive, but the menu was great” → {PRICE: negative, FOOD: positive}. One annotator validated the existing aspect category annotations of the corpus of Ganu et al. (2009). The agreement with the existing annotations was 92% measured as average Fl. Most disagreements concerned additions of missing aspect category annotations. Furthermore, the same annotator validated and corrected (if needed) the existing polarity labels per aspect category annotation. The agreement for the polarity labels was 87% in terms of accuracy and it was measured only on the common aspect category annotations. The additional 800 sentences (not present in Ganu et al.’s dataset) were used for testing and were annotated from scratch in the same manner. The distribution of the polarity clas</context>

Determining the aspect categories of the sentences and their polarities (Stage 2) was an easier task compared to detecting aspect terms and their polarities (Stage 1). The annotators needed less time in Stage 2 and it was easier to reach agreement. Exceptions were some sentences where it was difficult to decide if the categories AMBIENCE or ANECDOTES/MISCELLANEOUS applied (e.g., “One of my Fav spots in the city”). We instructed the annotators to classify those sentences only in ANECDOTES/MISCELLANEOUS, if they conveyed 4In the original dataset of Ganu et al.

ABSA is critical in mining and summarizing opinions from on-line reviews (Gamon et al., 2005; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Hu and Liu, 2004a; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005). In this setting, ABSA aims to identify the aspects of the entities being reviewed and to determine the sentiment the reviewers express for each aspect. Within the last decade, several ABSA systems of this kind have been developed for movie reviews (Thet et al., 2010), customer reviews of electronic products like digital cameras (Hu and Liu, 2004a) or netbook computers (Brody and Elhadad, 2010), services (Long et al., 2010), and restaurants (Ganu et al., 2009; Brody and Elhadad, 2010). Previous publicly available ABSA benchmark datasets adopt dif</context>

The task provided datasets containing manually annotated reviews of restaurants and laptops, as well as a common evaluation procedure. It attracted 163 submissions from 32 teams. 1 Introduction With the proliferation of user-generated content on the web, interest in mining sentiment and opinions in text has grown rapidly, both in academia and business. Early work in sentiment analysis mainly aimed to detect the overall polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of a given text or text span (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002). However, the need for a more fine-grained approach, such as aspect-based (or ‘feature-based’) sentiment analysis (ABSA), soon became apparent (Liu, 2012). For example, laptop reviews not only express the overall sentiment about a specific model (e.g., “This is a great This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.
