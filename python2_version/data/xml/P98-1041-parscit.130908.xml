Bilingual news article alignment methods based on
multi-lingual information retrieval have been shown
to be successful for the automatic production of
so-called noisy-parallel corpora. In this paper we
compare the use of machine translation (MT) to
the commonly used dictionary term lookup (DTL)
method for Reuter news article alignment in English
and Japanese. The results show the trade-off be-
tween improved lexical disambiguation provided by
machine translation and extended synonym choice
provided by dictionary term lookup and indicate
that MT is superior to DTL only at medium and
low recall levels. At high recall levels DTL has su-
perior precision.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841">
In this paper we compare the effectiveness of full ma-
chine translation (MT) and simple dictionary term
lookup (DTL) for the task of English-Japanese news
article alignment using the vector space model from
multi-lingual information retrieval. Matching texts
depends essentially on lexical coincidence between
the English text and the Japanese translation, and
we see that the two methods show the trade-off be-
tween reduced transfer ambiguity in MT and in-
creased synonymy in DTL.
Corpus-based approaches to natural language pro-
cessing are now well established for tasks such as vo-
cabulary and phrase acquisition, word sense disam-
biguation and pattern learning. The continued prac-
tical application of corpus-based methods is crit-
ically dependent on the availability of corpus re-
sources.
In machine translation we are concerned with the
provision of bilingual knowledge and we have found
that the types of language domains which users
are interested in such as news, current affairs and
technology, are poorly represented in today&apos;s pub-
lically available corpora. Our main area of interest
is English-Japanese translation, but there are few
clean parallel corpora available in large quantities.
As a result we have looked at ways of automatically
acquiring large amounts of parallel text for vocabu-
lary acquisition.
The World Wide Web and other Internet re-
sources provide a potentially valuable source of par-
allel texts. Newswire companies for example pub-
lish news articles in various languages and various
domains every day. We can expect a coincidence
of content in these collections of text, but the de-
gree of parallelism is likely to be less than is the
case for texts such as the United Nations and par-
liamentary proceedings. Nevertheless, we can expect
a coincidence of vocabulary, in the case of names of
people and places, organisations and events. This
time-sensitive bilingual vocabulary is valuable for
machine translation and makes a significant differ-
ence to user satisfaction by improving the compre-
hensibility of the output.
Our goal is to automatically produce a parallel
corpus of aligned articles from collections of English
and Japanese news texts for bilingual vocabulary ac-
quisition. The first stage in this process is to align
the news texts. Previously (Collier et al., 1998)
adapted multi-lingual (also called &amp;quot;translingual&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;cross-language&amp;quot;) information retrieval (MLIR) for
this purpose and showed the practicality of the
method. In this paper we extend their investigation
by comparing the performance of machine transla-
tion and conventional dictionary term translation for
this task.

2 MLIR Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860272727273">
There has recently been much interest in the
MLIR task (Carbonell et al., 1997)(Dumais et al.,
1996)(Hull and Grefenstette, 1996). MLIR differs
from traditional information retrieval in several re-
spects which we will discuss below. The most ob-
vious is that we must introduce a translation stage
in between matching the query and the texts in the
document collection.
Query translation, which is currently considered
to be preferable to document collection translation,
introduces several new factors to the IR task:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9846055">
• Term transfer mistakes - analysis is far from
perfect in today&apos;s MT systems and we must con-

sider how to compensate for incorrect transla-
tions.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998865583333333">
• Unresolved lexical ambiguity - occurs when anal-
ysis cannot decide between alternative mean-
ings of words in the target language.
• Synonym selection - when we use an MT sys-
tem to translate a query, generation will usually
result in a single lexical choice, even though al-
ternative synonyms exist. For matching texts,
the MT system may not have chosen the same
synonym in the translated query as the author
of the matching document.
• Vocabulary limitations - are an inevitable factor
when using bilingual dictionaries.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998206024390244">
Most of the previous work in MLIR has used sim-
ple dictionary term translation within the vector
space model (Salton, 1989). This avoids synonymy
selection constraints imposed by sentence generation
in machine translation systems, but fails to resolve
lexical transfer ambiguity. Since all possible transla-
tions are generated, the correctly matching term is
assumed to be contained in the list and term transfer
mistakes are not an explicit factor.
Two important issues need to be considered in dic-
tionary term based MLIR. The first, raised by Hull
et al (Hull and Grefenstette, 1996), is that generat-
ing multiple translations breaks the term indepen-
dence assumption of the vector space model. A sec-
ond issue, identified by (Davis, 1996), is whether vec-
tor matching methods can succeed given that they
essentially exploit linear (term-for-term) relations in
the query and target document. This becomes im-
portant for languages such as English and Japanese
where high-level transfer is necessary.
Machine translation of the query on the other
hand, uses high level analysis and should be able to
resolve much of the lexical transfer ambiguity sup-
plied by the bilingual dictionary, leading to signif-
icant improvements in performance over DTL, e.g.
see (Davis, 1996). We assume that the MT system
will select only one synonym where a choice exists
so term independence in the vector space model is
not a problem. Term transfer mistakes clearly de-
pend on the quality of analysis, but may become a
significant factor when the query contains only a few
terms and little surrounding context.
Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, no com-
parison has been attempted before between DTL
and MT in MLIR. This may be due either to the un-
reliability of MT, or because queries in MLIR tend
to be short phrases or single terms and MT is con-
sidered too challenging. In our application of article
alignment, where the query contains sentences, it is
both meaningful and important to compare the two
methods.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.995438" genericHeader="method">
3 News Article Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946">
The goal of news article alignment is the same as
that in MLIR: we want to find relevant matching
documents in the source language corpus collection
for those queries in the target language corpus col-
lection. The main characteristics which make news
article alignment different to MLIR are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991980538461538">
• Number of query terms - the number of terms
in a query is very large compared to the usual
IR task;
• Small search space - we can reduce the search
to those documents within a fixed range of the
publication date;
• Free text retrieval - we cannot control the search
vocabulary as is the case in some information
retrieval systems;
• High precision - is required because the quality
of the bilingual knowledge which we can acquire
is directly related to the quality of article align-
ment.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998953266666667">
We expect the end product of article alignment to
be a noisy-parallel corpus.
In contrast to clean-parallel texts we are just be-
ginning to explore noisy-parallel texts as a serious
option for corpus-based NLP, e.g. (Fung and McK-
eown, 1996). Noisy-parallel texts are characterised
by heavy reformatting at the translation stage, in-
cluding large sections of untranslated text and tex-
tual reordering. Methods which seek to align single
sentences are unlikely to succeed with noisy parallel
texts and we seek to match whole documents rather
than sentences before bilingual lexical knowledge ac-
quisition. The search effort required to align indi-
vidual documents is considerable and makes manual
alignment both tedious and time consuming.

4 System Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995363636364">
In our collections of English and Japanese news arti-
cles we find that the Japanese texts are much shorter
than the English texts, typically only two or three
paragraphs, and so it was natural to translate from
Japanese into English and to think of the Japanese
texts as queries. The goal of article alignment can
be reformulated as an IR task by trying to find
the English document(s) in the collection (corpus)
of news articles which most closely corresponded to
the Japanese query. The overall system is outlined
in Figure 1 and discussed below.

consider to be relevant to international news events.
The disadvantage of term vector translation using
DTL arises from the shallow level of analysis. This
leads to the incorporation of a range of polysemes
and homographs in the translated query which re-
duces the precision of document retrieval. In fact,
the greater the depth of coverage in the bilingual
lexicon, the greater this problem will become.

4.2 Machine translation method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969580142857143">
Full machine translation (MT) is another option for
the translation stage and it should allow us to reduce
the transfer ambiguity inherent in the DTL model
through linguistic analysis. The system we use is
Toshiba Corporation&apos;s ASTRANSAC (Hirakawa et
al., 1991) for Japanese to English translation.
The translation model in ASTRANSAC is the
transfer method, following the standard process of
morphological analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic
analysis and selection of translation words. Analy-
sis uses ATNs (Augmented Transition Networks) on
a context free grammar. We modified the system
so that it used the same dictionary resources as the
DTL method described above.

Figure 2 shows an example sentence taken from a
Japanese query together with its English translation
produced by MT and DTL methods. We see that in
both translations there is missing vocabulary (e.g. &amp;quot;
—7. • 7 *---t l-&amp;quot; is not translated); since the
two methods both use the same dictionary resource
this is a constant factor and we can ignore it for
comparison purposes.
As expected we see that MT has correctly re-
solved some of the lexical ambiguities such as `-ft

In the case of synonymy we notice that MT has
decided on &amp;quot;independent&amp;quot; as the translation of &amp;quot;*.
, DTL also includes the synonyms &amp;quot;individual,
singlehanded, single, separate, sole,...&amp;quot; ,etc.. The au-
thor of the correctly matching English text actually
chose the term `singlehanded&apos;, so synonym expan-
sion will provide us with a better match in this case.
The choice of synonyms is quite dependent on au-
thor preference and style considerations which MT
cannot be expected to second-guess.
The limitations of MT analysis give us some selec-
tion errors, for example we see that &amp;quot;4 :/
T 6&amp;quot; is translated as &amp;quot;flying the India sky&amp;quot;,
whereas the natural translation would be &apos;flying over
India&amp;quot;, even though &apos;over&apos; is registered as a possible

5 Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980125">
The English document collection consisted of Reuter
daily news articles taken from the internet for the
December 1996 to the May 1997. In total we have
6782 English articles with an average of about 45
articles per day. After pre-processing to remove hy-
pertext and formatting characters we are left with
approximately 140000 paragraphs of English text.
In contrast to the English news articles, the
Japanese articles, which are also produced daily by
Reuter&apos;s, are very short. The Japanese is a trans-
lated summary of an English article, but consider-
able reformatting has taken place. In many cases
the Japanese translation seems to draw on multiple
sources including some which do not appear on the
public newswire at all. The 1488 Japanese articles
cover the same period as the English articles.

6 Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994546">
The task of text alignment takes a list of texts
{Q`0,.., Qin} in a target language and a list of texts
{Do, .., Dm} in a source language and produces a list
of aligned pairs. A pair &lt; qz, Du &gt; is in the list if
qz is a partial or whole translation of D. In order
to decide on whether the source and target language
text should be in the list of aligned pairs we translate
qx into the source language to obtain Q using bilin-
gual dictionary lookup. We then match texts from
{Qo, •., } and {Do, .., Dm} using standard models
from Information Retrieval. We now describe the
basic model.

Terminology

<bodyText confidence="0.9984504">
An index of t terms is generated from the docu-
ment collection (English corpus) and the query set
(Japanese translated articles). Each document has a
description vector D = (wdi,Wd2, • •, Wdt) where wdk
represents the weight of term k in document D. The
set of documents in the collection is N, and nk rep-
resents the number of documents in which term k
appears. tfdk denotes the term frequency of term k
in document D. A query Q is formulated as a query

We implemented the standard vector-space model
with cosine normalisation, inverse document fre-
quency idf and lexical stemming using the Porter
algorithm (Porter, 1980) to remove suffix variations
between surface words.
The cosine rule is used to compensate for varia-
tions in document length and the number of terms
when matching a query Q from the Japanese text
collection and a document D from the English text
collection.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999695">
In order to automatically evaluate fractional recall
and precision it was necessary to construct a repre-
sentative set of Japanese articles with their correct
English article alignments. We call this a judge-
ment set. Although it is a significant effort to eval-
uate alignments by hand, this is possibly the only
way to obtain an accurate assessment of the align-
ment performance. Once alignment has taken place
we compared the threshold filtered set of English-
Japanese aligned articles with the judgement set to
obtain recall-precision statistics.
The judgement set consisted of 100 Japanese
queries with 454 relevant English documents. Some
24 Japanese queries had no corresponding English
document at all. This large percentage of irrelevant
queries can be thought of as `distractors&apos; and is a
particular feature of this alignment task.
This set was then given to a bilingual checker who
was asked to score each aligned article pair according
to (1) the two articles are translations of each other,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8134708">
(2) the two articles are strongly contextually related,
(3) no match. We removed type 3 correspondences
so that the judgement set contained pairs of articles
which at least shared the same context, i.e. referred
to the same news event.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995182428571429">
Following inspection of matching articles we used
the heuristic that the search space for each Japanese
query was one day either side of the day of publica-
tion. On average this was 135 articles. This is small
by the standards of conventional IR tasks, but given
the large number of distractor queries, the require-
ment for high precision and the need to translate
queries, the task is challenging.
We will define recall and precision in the usual
way as follows:
no. of relevant items retrieved (3)
recall =
no. of relevant items in collection
no. of relevant items retrieved

Results for the model with MT and DTL are
shown in Figure 3. We see that in the basic tf+idf
model, machine translation provides significantly
better article matching performance for medium and
low levels of recall. For high recall levels DTL is bet-
ter. Lexical transfer disambiguation appears to be
important for high precision, but synonym choices
are crucial for good recall.

Overall the MT method obtained an average pre-
cision of 0.72 in the 0.1 to 0.9 recall range and DTL
has an average precision of 0.67. This 5 percent over-
all improvement can be partly attributed to the fact
that the Japanese news articles provided sufficient
surrounding context to enable word sense disam-
biguation to be effective. It may also show that syn-
onym selection is not so detrimental where a large
number of other terms exist in the query. However,
given these advantages we still see that DTL per-
forms almost as well as MT and better at higher
recall levels. In order to maximise recall, synonym
lists provided by DTL seem to be important. More-
over, on inspection of the results we found that for
some weakly matching document-query pairs in the
judgement set, a mistranslation of an important or
rare term may significantly bias the matching score.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999783125">
We have investigated the performance of MLIR with
the DTL and MT models for news article alignment
using English and Japanese texts. The results in
this paper have shown surprisingly that MT does
not have a clear advantage over the DTL model at all
levels of recall. The trade-off between lexical trans-
fer ambiguity and synonymy implies that we should
seek a middle strategy: a sophisticated system would
perhaps perform homonym disambiguation and then
leave alternative synonyms in the translation query
list. This should maximise both precision and re-
call and will be a target for our future work. Fur-
thermore, we would like to extend our investigation
to other MLIR test sets to see how MT performs
against DTL when the number of terms in the query
is smaller.

Nevertheless, we can expect a coincidence of vocabulary, in the case of names of people and places, organisations and events. This time-sensitive bilingual vocabulary is valuable for machine translation and makes a significant difference to user satisfaction by improving the comprehensibility of the output.

We expect the end product of article alignment to be a noisy-parallel corpus. In contrast to clean-parallel texts we are just beginning to explore noisy-parallel texts as a serious option for corpus-based NLP, e.g. (Fung and McKeown, 1996). Noisy-parallel texts are characterised by heavy reformatting at the translation stage, including large sections of untranslated text and textual reordering. Methods which seek to align single sentences are unlikely to succeed with noisy parallel texts and we seek to match whole documents rather than sentences before bilingual lexical knowledge acquisition. The search effort required to align individual documents is considerable and makes manual alignment both tedious and time consuming. 4 System Overview In our collections of English and Japanese news articles we find that the Japanese texts</context>

This leads to the incorporation of a range of polysemes and homographs in the translated query which reduces the precision of document retrieval. In fact, the greater the depth of coverage in the bilingual lexicon, the greater this problem will become. 4.2 Machine translation method Full machine translation (MT) is another option for the translation stage and it should allow us to reduce the transfer ambiguity inherent in the DTL model through linguistic analysis. The system we use is Toshiba Corporation&apos;s ASTRANSAC (Hirakawa et al., 1991) for Japanese to English translation. The translation model in ASTRANSAC is the transfer method, following the standard process of morphological analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis and selection of translation words. Analysis uses ATNs (Augmented Transition Networks) on a context free grammar. We modified the system so that it used the same dictionary resources as the DTL method described above. 4.3 Example query translation Figure 2 shows an example sentence taken from a Japanese query together with its English translation produced by MT and DTL methods.

The set of documents in the collection is N, and nk represents the number of documents in which term k appears. tfdk denotes the term frequency of term k in document D. A query Q is formulated as a query description vector Q = (wqi, wq2, • •, wqt)• 6.1 Model We implemented the standard vector-space model with cosine normalisation, inverse document frequency idf and lexical stemming using the Porter algorithm (Porter, 1980) to remove suffix variations between surface words.
