A statistical model is presented which predicts the strengths of word-associations from the
relative frequencies of the common occurrences of words in large bodies of text. These
predictions are compared with the Minnesota association norms for 100 stimulus words. The
average agreement between the predicted and the observed responses is only slightly weaker
than the agreement between the responses of an arbitrary subject and the responses of the
other subjects. It is shown that the approach leads to equally good results for both English
and German.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999695884615385">
In the association experiment first used by Calton (1880) subjects are asked to respond to
a stimulus word with the first word that comes to their mind. These associative responses
have been explained in psychology by the principle of learning by contiguity: &amp;quot;Objects once
experienced together tend to become associated in the imagination, so that when any one of
them is thought of, the others are likely to be thought of also, in the same order of sequence
or coexistence as before. This statement we may name the law of mental association by
contiguity.&amp;quot; (William James, 1890, p. 561).
When the association experiment is conducted with many subjects, tables are obtained
which list the frequencies of particular responses to the stimulus words. These tables are called
association norms. Many studies in psychology give evidence that there is a relation between
the perception, learning and forgetting of verbal material and the associations between words.
If we assume that word-associations determine language production, then it should be
possible to estimate the strength of an associative relation between two words on the basis
of the relative frequencies that these words co-occur in texts. Church et al. (1989), Wettler
It Rapp (1989) and Church &amp; Hanks (1990) describe algorithms which do this. However, the
validity of these algorithms has not been tested by systematic comparisons with associations
of human subjects. This paper describes such a comparison and shows that corpus-based
computations of word associations are similar to association norms collected from human
subjects.
According to the law of association by contiguity, the association strength between two
words should be a function of the relative frequency of the two words being perceived together,
i.e. the relative frequency of the two words occuring together. Further more, the association
strength between words should determine word selection during language or speech produc-
tion: Only those words can be uttered or written down which associatively come to mind.
If this assumption holds, then it should be possible to predict word associations from the
common occurences of words in texts.

2 Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989152">
According to the law of association by contiguity the learning of associations can be described
as follows: If two words i and j occur together, the association strength aij(t) between i and
j is increased by a constant fraction of the difference between the maximum and the actual
association strength. This leads for association strengths between 0 and 1 to the following
formula:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993879">
(t + 1) = ai,j(t) + (1 — a,j (t)) • 81 if (i&amp;j) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964325">
If word i occurs in another context, i. e. not in proximity to word j, the association strength
between i and j is decreased by a constant fraction:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.971359">
ai,j (t + 1) = a,1(t) • (1 — 02) if (i&amp;-,j) (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.917033333333333">
Under the assumption that the learning rate 81 and the inhibition rate 02 are of identical
size, the expected value aid of the association strength aij(t) from i to j for t oo is equal
to the conditional probability of j given i (compare Foppa, 1965):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.976676">
aij = (3)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964714285714">
From these assumptions it could be expected that a stimulus word i leads to those response
j, for which the value of equation 3 is at a maximum.
Rapp &amp; Wettler (1991) compared this with other predictions, where additional assump-
tions on learning and reproduction were taken into account. With equation 3, mainly words
with high corpus frequencies, e. g. function words, were predicted as associative responses.
The predictions were improved when the following formula was used with an exponent of
a = 0.66, and the word with the highest rid was considered to be the associative response.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.912216">
nu; = (4)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997218">
The introduction of the denominator indicates that in the association experiment less frequent
words are used than during language production. This inhibition of frequent words can be
explained by the experimental situation, which furthers responses that are specific to the
stimulus word. The exponential function can be interpreted as the tendency that subjective
estimations are often found to be exponential functions of the quantities to be estimated.

3 Association norms used
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999106615384616">
For the comparison between the predicted and the associations of human subjects we have
used the association norms collected by Russell &amp; Jenkins (Jenkins, 1970). They have the
advantage that translations of the stimulus words were also given to German subjects (Russell
&amp; Meseck, 1959, and Russell, 1970) so that our model could be tested for English as well as
for German.
The Russell &amp; Jenkins association norms, also referred to as the Minnesota word associ-
ation norms, were collected in 1952. The 100 stimulus words from the Kent-Rosanoff word
association test (Kent &amp; Rosanoff, 1910) were presented to 1008 students of two large intro-
ductory psychology classes at the University of Minnesota. The subjects were instructed, to
write after each word &apos;the first word that it makes you think or. Seven years later, Russell
&amp; Meseck (1959) repeated the same experiment in Germany with a carefully translated list of
the stimulus words. The subjects were 331 students and pupils from the area near Wiirzburg.
The quantitative results reported on later will be based on comparisons with these norms.

<bodyText confidence="0.999937">
The American as well as the German association norms were collected more than 30 years
ago. The texts which were used to simulate these associations are more recent. One might
expect therefore that this discrepancy will impair the agreement between the observed and
the predicted responses. Better predictions might be attained if the observed associations had
been produced by the same subjects as the texts from which the predictions are computed.
However, such a procedure is hardly realizable, and our results will show that despite these
discrepancies associations to common words can be predicted successfully.

4 Text corpora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958">
In order to get reliable estimates of the co-occurences of words, large text corpora have to be
used. Since associations of the &amp;quot;average subject&amp;quot; are to be simulated, the texts should not
be specific to a certain domain, but reflect the wide distribution of different types of texts
and speech as perceived in every day life.
The following selection of some 33 million words of machine readable English texts used
in this study is a modest attempt to achieve this goal:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981193">
• Brown corpus of present day American English (1 million words)
• LOB corpus of present day British English (1 million words)
• Belletristic literature from Project Gutenberg (1 million words)
• Articles from the New Scientist from Oxford Text Archive (1 million words)
• Wall Street Journal from the ACL/DCI (selection of 6 million words)
• Hansard Corpus. Proceedings of the Canadian Parliament (selection of 5 million words
from the ACL/DCI-corpus)
• Grolier&apos;s Electronic Encyclopedia (8 million words)
• Psychological Abstracts from PsycLIT (selection of 3.5 million words)
• Agricultural abstracts from the Agricola database (3.5 million words)
• DOE scientific abstracts from the ACL/DCI (selection of 3 million words)
To compute associations for German the following corpora comprising about 21 million words
were used:
• LIMAS corpus of present-day written German (1.1 million words)
• Freiburger Korpus from the Institute for German Language (IDS), Mannheim (0.5
million words of spoken German)
• Mannheimer Korpus 1 from the IDS (2.2 million words of present-day written German
from books and periodicals)
• Handbuchkorpora 85, 86 and 87 from the IDS (9.3 million words of newspaper texts)
• German abstracts from the psychological database PSYNDEX (8 million words)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988607714285714">
For technical reasons, not all words occuring in the corpora have been used in the simulation.
The vocabulary used consists of all words which appear more than ten times in the English
or German corpus. It also includes all 100 stimulus words and all responses in the English
or German association norms. This leads to an English vocabulary of about 72000 and a
German vocabulary of 65000 words. Hereby, a word is defined as a string of alpha characters
separated by non-alpha characters. Punctuation marks and special characters are treated as
words.

5 Computation of the association strengths
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999825">
The text corpora were read in word by word. Whenever one of the 100 stimulus words
occured, it was determined which other words occured within a distance of twelve words to
the left or to the right of the stimulus word, and for every pair a counter was updated. The
so defined frequencies of co-occurence 11(i&amp;D, the frequencies of the single words R(i) and
the total number of words in the corpus Q were stored in tables. Using these tables, the
probabilities in formula (4) can be replaced by relative frequencies:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997497666666667">
H(arj) H(j)° Qa H(i&amp;j)
* (5)
1I(i) .11(i) 1-/(j)a
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989798">
In this formula the first term on the right side does not depend on j and therefore has no
effect on the prediction of the associative response. With H(j) in the denominator of the
second term, estimation errors have a strong impact on the association strengths for rare
words. Therefore, by modifying formula (5), words with low corpus frequencies had to be
weakened.

17(i&amp;i)/(7 - Q) fiir HU) 50-4
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9959193">
According to our model the word j with the highest associative strength to the stimulus
word i should be the associative response. The best results were observed when parameter
a was chosen to be 0.66. Parameters # and 7 turned out to be relatively uncritical, and
therefore to simplify parameter optimization were both set to the same value of 0.00002.
Ongoing research shows that formula (6) has a number of weaknesses, for example that
it does not discriminate words with co-occurence-frequency zero, as discussed by Gale 4Sz
Church (1990) in a comparable context. However, since the results reported on later are
acceptable, it probably gets the major issues right. One is, that subjects usually respond
with common, i.e. frequent words in the free association task. The other is, that estimations
of co-occurence-frequencies for low-frequency-words are too poor to be useful.

In table 1 a few sample association lists as predicted by our system are compared to the as-
sociative responses as given by the subjects in the Russell &amp; Jenkins experiment. A complete
list of the predicted and observed responses is given in table 2. It shows for all 100 stimulus
words used in the association experiment conducted by Russell &amp; Jenkins, a) their corpus
frequency, b) the primary response, i.e. the most frequent response given by the subjects,
c) the number of subjects who gave the primary response, d) the predicted response and
e) the number of subjects who gave the predicted response.
The valuation of the predictions has to take into account that association norms are
conglomerates of the answers of different subjects which differ considerably from each other.
A satisfactory prediction would be proven if the difference between the predicted and the
observed responses were about equal to the difference between an average subject and the
rest of the subjects. The following interpretations look for such correspondences.
For 17 out of the 100 stimulus words the predicted response is equal to the observed
primary response. This compares to an average of 37 primary responses given by a subject
in the Russell &amp; Jenkins experiment. A slightly better result is obtained for the correspon-
dence between the predicted and the observed associations when it is considered, how many

subjects had given the predicted
response: Averaged over all stim-
ulus words and all subjects, a
predicted response was given by
12.6% of the subjects. By com-
parison, an associative response of
an arbitrary subject was given by
21.9% of the remaining subjects.
When only those 27 stimulus
words are considered, whose pri-
mary response was given by at
least 500 subjects, an arbitrary
response was given by 45.5% of
the subjects on average. By com-
parison, the predicted response to
one of these 27 stimulus words
was given by 32.6% of the sub-
jects. This means, that for stim-
ulus words where the variation
among subjects is small, the pre-
dictions improve.
On the other hand, 35 of the
predicted responses were given by
no subject at all, whereas an av-
erage subject gives only 5.9 out of
100 responses that are given by no
other subject. In about half of the
cases we attribute this poor per-
formance to the lack of represen-
tativity of the corpus. For exam-
ple, the predictions combustion to
the stimulus bed or brokerage to
house can be explained by specific
verbal usage in the DOE scientific
abstracts respectively in the Wall
Street Journal.
In most other cases instead of
paradigmatic associations (words
that are used in similar contexts)
syntagmatic associations (words
that are often used together) are
predicted. Examples are the pre-
diction of term to the stimulus
long, where most subjects an-
swered with short, or the predic-
tion of folk to music, where most
subjects responded with song.

Using the corpora listed in section 4, the same simulation as described above was conducted
for German. For the computation of the associative strengths, again formula 6 was used. For
optimal results, only a small adjustment had to be made to parameter alpha (from 0.66 to
0.68). However, a significant change was necessary for parameters /3 and 7, which again for
ease of parameter optimization were assumed to be identical. 13 and 7 had to be reduced by
a factor of approximately four from a value of 0.00002 to a value of 0.000005. Apart from
these parameters, nothing was changed in the algorithm.
Table 3 compares the quantitative results as given above for both languages. The
figures can be interpreted as follows: With an average of 21.9% of the other subjects giving
the same response as an arbitrary subject, the variation among subjects is much smaller in
English than it is in German (8.7%). This is reflected in the simulation results, where both
figures (12.6% and 6.9%) have a similar ratio, however at a lower level.
This observation is confirmed when only stimuli with low variation of the associative re-
sponses are considered. In both languages, the decrease in variation is in about the same
order of magnitude for experiment and simulation. Overall, the simulation results are some-
what better for German than they are for English. This may be surprising, since with a
total of 33 million words the English corpus is larger than the German with 21 million words.
However, if one has a closer look at the texts, it becomes clear, that the German corpus,
by incorporating popular newspapers and spoken language, is clearly more representative to
everyday language.

<bodyText confidence="0.99991980952381">
In the simulation results a bias towards syntagmatic associations was found. Since the as-
sociations were computed from co-occurences of words in texts, this preference of syntag-
matic associations is not surprising. It is remarkable, instead, that many associations usually
considered to be paradigmatic are predicted correctly. Examples include man woman,
black -.4 white and bitter sweet. We believe, however, that the tendency to prefer syntag-
matic associations can be reduced by not counting co-occurences found within collocations.
Equivalently, the association strength between word pairs always occuring together in a strict
formation (separated by a constant number of other words) could be reduced.
When going from English to German, the parameters ,3 and -y in equation 6 needed
to be readjusted in such a way, that less frequent words obtained a better chance to be
associated. This reflects the fact, that there is more variation in the associative responses
of German than of American subjects, and that American subjects tend to respond with
words of higher corpus frequency. We believe that by considering additional languages this
parameter adjustment could be predicted from word-frequency-distribution.
In conclusion, the results show, that free word associations for English and German can
be successfully predicted by an almost identical algorithm which is based on the co-occurence-
frequencies of words in texts. Some peculiarities in the associative behavior of the subjects
were confirmed in the simulation. Together, this is a good indication that the learning of
word associations is governed by the law of association by contiguity.
Although our simulation results are not perfect, specialized versions of our program have
already proved useful in a number of applications:

• Information Retrieval: Generation of search terms for document retrieval in biblio-
graphic databases (Wettler &amp; Rapp, 1989, Ferber, Wettler &amp; Rapp, 1993).
• Marketing: Association norms are useful to predict what effects word usage in adver-
tisements has on people (Wettler Si Rapp, 1993). Multilingual assocation norms help
to find a global marketing strategy in international markets (Kroeber-Riel, 1992).
• Machine Translation: In an experimental prototype we have shown that associations de-
rived from context are useful to find the correct translations for semantically ambiguous
words.

The successful prediction of different types of verbal behavior on the basis of co-occurrences
of words in texts is a direct application of the classical contiguity-theory, or, in more modern
neurophysiological terms, of Hebb&apos;s learning rule. Cognitive psychology has severely criti-
cized contiguity-theory with the arguments that association theory did not produce useful
results (Jenkins, 1974), and that associations are not the result of associative learning but of
underlying semantic processes (Clark, 1970). Both arguments need a critical revision. Re-
cent work with large corpora as well as a large number of connectionist studies have yielded
very useful results in different psychological domains, and the high predictive power of the
associationist approach makes that the intuitive appeal of cognitivist explanations is fading
rapidly.

These associative responses have been explained in psychology by the principle of learning by contiguity: &amp;quot;Objects once experienced together tend to become associated in the imagination, so that when any one of them is thought of, the others are likely to be thought of also, in the same order of sequence or coexistence as before. This statement we may name the law of mental association by contiguity.&amp;quot; (William James, 1890, p. 561). When the association experiment is conducted with many subjects, tab</context>

This inhibition of frequent words can be explained by the experimental situation, which furthers responses that are specific to the stimulus word. The exponential function can be interpreted as the tendency that subjective estimations are often found to be exponential functions of the quantities to be estimated. 3 Association norms used For the comparison between the predicted and the associations of human subjects we have used the association norms collected by Russell &amp; Jenkins (Jenkins, 1970). They have the advantage that translations of the stimulus words were also given to German subjects (Russell &amp; Meseck, 1959, and Russell, 1970) so that our model could be tested for English as well as for German.

The 100 stimulus words from the Kent-Rosanoff word association test (Kent &amp; Rosanoff, 1910) were presented to 1008 students of two large introductory psychology classes at the University of Minnesota.

Some peculiarities in the associative behavior of the subjects were confirmed in the simulation. Together, this is a good indication that the learning of word associations is governed by the law of association by contiguity. Although our simulation results are not perfect, specialized versions of our program have already proved useful in a number of applications: • Information Retrieval: Generation of search terms for document retrieval in bibliographic databases (Wettler &amp; Rapp, 1989, Ferber, Wettler &amp; Rapp, 1993). • Marketing: Association norms are useful to predict what effects word usage in advertisements has on people (Wettler Si Rapp, 1993). Multilingual assocation norms help to find a global marketing strategy in international markets (Kroeber-Riel, 1992). • Machine Translation: In an experimental prototype we have shown that associations derived from context are useful to find the correct translations for semantically ambiguous words. The successful prediction of different types of verbal behavior on the basis of co-occurrences of words in texts is a direct application of the classical contiguit</context>
