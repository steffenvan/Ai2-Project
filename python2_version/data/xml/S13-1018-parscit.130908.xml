Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999927">
We approach the typed-similarity task using
a range of heuristics that rely on information
from the appropriate metadata fields for each
type of similarity. In addition we train a linear
regressor for each type of similarity. The re-
sults indicate that the linear regression is key
for good performance. Our best system was
ranked third in the task.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996019047619">
The typed-similarity dataset comprises pairs of Cul-
tural Heritage items from Europeana1, a single ac-
cess point to digitised versions of books, paintings,
films, museum objects and archival records from in-
stitutions throughout Europe. Typically, the items
comprise meta-data describing a cultural heritage
item and, sometimes, a thumbnail of the item itself.
Participating systems need to compute the similarity
between items using the textual meta-data. In addi-
tion to general similarity, the dataset includes spe-
cific kinds of similarity, like similar author, similar
time period, etc.
We approach the problem using a range of sim-
ilarity techniques for each similarity types, these
make use of information contained in the relevant
meta-data fields.In addition, we train a linear regres-
sor for each type of similarity, using the training data
provided by the organisers with the previously de-
fined similarity measures as features.

tion 2, followed by the machine learning system in

The items in this task are taken from Europeana.
They cannot be redistributed, so we used the urls
and scripts provided by the organizers to extract the
corresponding metadata. We analysed the text in the
metadata, performing lemmatization, PoS tagging,
named entity recognition and classification (NERC)
and date detection using Stanford CoreNLP (Finkel
et al., 2005; Toutanova et al., 2003). A preliminary
score for each similarity type was then calculated as
follows:

2.1 TF.IDF
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933947368421">
A common approach to computing document sim-
ilarity is to represent documents as Bag-Of-Words
(BOW). Each BOW is a vector consisting of the
words contained in the document, where each di-
mension corresponds to a word, and the weight is
the frequency in the corresponding document. The
similarity between two documents can be computed
as the cosine of the angle between their vectors. This
is the approached use above.
This approach can be improved giving more
weight to words which occur in only a few docu-
ments, and less weight to words occurring in many
documents (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).
In our system, we count document frequencies of
words using Wikipedia as a reference corpus since
the training data consists of only 750 items associ-
ated with short textual information and might not be
sufficient for reliable estimations. The TF.IDF sim-
ilarity between items a and b is defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9991255">
simtf.idf(a, b) _
EwEa,b tfw,a X tfw,b X idf2w

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999682">
where tf,,,,,, is the frequency of the term w in x E
{a, b} and idf,,, is the inverted document frequency
of the word w measured in Wikipedia. We substi-
tuted the preliminary general similarity score by the
obtained using the TF.IDF presented in this section.

2.2 UKB
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999718">
The semantic disambiguation UKB3 algorithm
(Agirre and Soroa, 2009) applies personalized
PageRank on a graph generated from the English
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), or alternatively, from
Wikipedia. This algorithm has proven to be very
competitive in word similarity tasks (Agirre et al.,
2010).
To compute similarity using UKB we represent
WordNet as a graph G = (V, E) as follows: graph
nodes represent WordNet concepts (synsets) and
</bodyText>

dictionary words; relations among synsets are rep-
resented by undirected edges; and dictionary words
are linked to the synsets associated to them by di-
rected edges.
Our method is provided with a pair of vectors of
words and a graph-based representation of WordNet.
We first compute the personalized PageRank over
WordNet separately for each of the vector of words,
producing a probability distribution over WordNet
synsets. We then compute the similarity between
these two probability distributions by encoding them
as vectors and computing the cosine between the
vectors. We present each step in turn.
Once personalized PageRank is computed, it
returns a probability distribution over WordNet
synsets. The similarity between two vectors of
words can thus be implemented as the similarity be-
tween the probability distributions, as given by the
cosine between the vectors.
We used random walks to compute improved sim-
ilarity values for author, people involved, location
and event similarity:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99001025">
• Author: UKB over Wikipedia using person en-
tities recognized by NERC in the dc:Creator
field.
• People involved and location: UKB over
Wikipedia using people/location entities recog-
nized by NERC in all fields.
• Events: UKB over WordNet using event nouns
and verbs recognized in all fields.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997976166666667">
Results on the training data showed that perfor-
mance using this approach was quite low (with the
exception of events). This was caused by the large
number of cases where the Stanford parser did not
find entities which were in Wikipedia. With those
cases on mind, we combined the scores returned by
UKB with the similarity scores presented in Section
2 as follows: if UKB similarity returns a score, we
multiply both, otherwise we return the square of the
other similarity score. Using the multiplication of
the two scores, the results on the training data im-
proved.

2.3 Time similarity measure

<bodyText confidence="0.999968">
In order to measure the time similarity between a
pair of items, we need to recognize time expres-
sions in both items. We assume that the year of

creation or the year denoting when the event took
place in an artefact are good indicators for time sim-
ilarity. Therefore, information about years is ex-
tracted from each item using the following pattern:
[1|2][0 − 9]{3}. Using this approach, each item is
represented as a set of numbers denoting the years
mentioned in the meta-data.
Time similarity between two items is computed
based on the similarity between their associated
years. Similarity between two years is defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.772857">
simyear(y1, y2) = max{0,1 − |y1 − y2 |∗ k}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999015714285714">
k is a parameter to weight the difference between
two years, e.g. for k = 0.1 all items that have differ-
ence of 10 years or more assigned a score of 0. We
obtained best results for k = 0.1.
Finally, time similarity between items a and b is
computed as the maximum of the pairwise similarity
between their associated years:

score by the measure obtained using the method pre-
sented in this section.

The above heuristics can be good indicators for the
respective kind of similarity, and can be thus applied
directly to the task. In this section, we take those
indicators as features, and use linear regression (as
made available by Weka (Hall et al., 2009)) to learn
models that fit the features to the training data.
We generated further similarity scores for gen-
eral similarity, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), UKB and Wikipedia Link
Vector Model (WLVM)(Milne, 2007) using infor-
mation taken from all fields, as explained below.

LDA (Blei et al., 2003) is a statistical method that
learns a set of latent variables called topics from a
training corpus. Given a topic model, documents
can be inferred as probability distributions over top-
ics, 0. The distribution for a document i is denoted
as Bi. An LDA model is trained using the train-
ing set consisting of 100 topics using the gensim

The similarity between a pair of items is estimated
by comparing their topic distributions following the
method proposed in Aletras et al. (2012; Aletras and
Stevenson (2012). This is achieved by considering
each distribution as a vector (consisting of the topics
corresponding to an item and its probability) then
computing the cosine of the angle between them, i.e.

We run UKB (Section 2.2) to generate a probabil-
ity distribution over WordNet synsets for all of the
words of all items. Similarity between two words
is computed by creating vectors from these distri-
butions and comparing them using the cosine of the
angle between the two vectors. If a words does not
appear in WordNet its similarity value to every other
word is set to 0. We refer to that similarity metric as
UKB here.

forming pairwise comparison between their words,

cles is measured using the Wikipedia Link Vector
Model (WLVM) (Milne, 2007). WLVM uses both
the link structure and the article titles of Wikipedia
to measure similarity between two Wikipedia arti-
cles. Each link is weighted by the probability of it
occurring. Thus, the value of the weight w for a link
x → y between articles x and y is:

The similarity of articles is compared by forming
vectors of the articles which are linked from them
and computing the cosine of their angle. For exam-
ple the vectors of two articles x and y are:

<equation confidence="0.998882">

where x and y are two Wikipedia articles and x → li

Since the items have been mapped to Wikipedia
articles, similarity between two items is computed
by performing pairwise comparison between articles

We selected three systems for submission. The first
run uses the similarity scores of the basic system
(Section 2) for each similarity types as follows:

• General: cosine similarity of TF.IDF vectors,
IDF based on Wikipedia (as shown in Section
2.1).
• Author: product of the scores obtained ob-

• People involved and location: product of co-

shown in Section 2.2) using the data extracted
from all fields.
• Time period: time similarity measure (as

vectors and UKB (as shown in Section 2.2) of
event nouns and verbs recognized in all fields.
• Subject and description: cosine similarity of
TF.IDF vectors of respective fields (as shown

For the second run we trained a ML model for
each of the similarity types, using the following fea-

• Cosine similarity of TF.IDF vectors as shown
in Section 2 for the eight similarity types.
• Four new values for general similarity: TF.IDF
(Section 2.1), LDA (Section 3.1), UKB and

In addition we train a linear regressor for each type of similarity. The results indicate that the linear regression is key for good performance.

We describe each of these processes in turn. 2.1 TF.IDF A common approach to computing document similarity is to represent documents as Bag-Of-Words (BOW). Each BOW is a vector consisting of the words contained in the document, where each dimension corresponds to a word, and the weight is the frequency in the corresponding document. The similarity between two documents can be computed as the cosine of the angle between their vectors. This is the approached use above.

Thus, the value of the weight w for a link x → y between articles x and y is: w(x → y) = |x → y |× log where t is the total number of articles in Wikipedia. The similarity of articles is compared by forming vectors of the articles which are linked from them and computing the cosine of their angle.
