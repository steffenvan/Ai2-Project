We present a rule-based method to automati-
cally create a large-coverage semantic lexicon
of French adjectives by extracting paradig-
matic relations from lexicographic definitions.
Formalized adjectival resources are, indeed,
scarce for French and they mostly focus on
morphological and syntactic information. Our
objective is, therefore, to contribute enriching
the available set of resources by taking advan-
tage of reliable lexicographic data and formal-
izing it with the well-established lexical func-
tions formalism. The resulting semantic lexi-
con of French adjectives can be used in NLP
tasks such as word sense disambiguation or
machine translation. After presenting related
work, we describe the extraction method and
the formalization procedure of the data. Our
method is then quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluated. We discuss the results of the evalu-

<bodyText confidence="0.9999026">
Formalized semantic resources are highly valuable
in areas such as NLP, linguistic analysis or lan-
guage acquisition. However, creating such resources
from scratch is time-consuming and generally yields
limited-size lexicons. Existing lexicographic dictio-
naries do have a large coverage and present a reli-
able content. They lack nevertheless the sufficient
formalization. In this paper, we present a rule-based
method to automatically create a large-coverage se-
mantic lexicon of French adjectives by extracting
paradigmatic relations from lexicographic defini-
tions using lexico-syntactic patterns. Formalized ad-
jectival resources are, indeed, scarce for French and
they mostly focus on morphological and syntactic
information. Our goal is, therefore, to contribute en-
riching the available set of resources by taking ad-
vantage of reliable lexicographic data and formal-
izing it with the well-established lexical functions
formalism of the Meaning-Text theory (Mel’ˇcuk,
1996). The resulting semantic lexicon of French
adjectives can be used in NLP tasks such as word
sense disambiguation or machine translation1. In
section 2, we present related work. In section 3, we
expose the method used to build the lexicon, i.e. the
extraction method and the formalization procedure
of the data, and outline the main results. Finally, in
section 4, we present a quantitative evaluation of our
method and a qualitative evaluation of our data, and
discuss their results. We conclude on some perspec-
tives for future work.

It is well established that there are different types
of adjectives distinguished by properties, such as
gradation and markedness, and by their seman-
tic and syntactic behaviors (antonymy, selectional
preferences) (Fellbaum et al., 1993; Raskin and
Nirenburg, 1996). WordNet, for example, distin-
guishes different types of adjectives according to
their semantic and syntactic behaviors: descriptive,
reference-modifying, color and relational adjectives
(Fellbaum et al., 1993). However, it mainly accounts
for the first and the last types of adjectives. Descrip-

tive adjectives are organized in adjectival synsets
that are mostly related through antonymy (heavy–
light); synsets of relational adjectives are linked to a
related noun by a pointer (fraternal–brother). Fell-
baum et al. (1993:36) acknowledge the existence of
more diverse relations to nominal synsets, but, to our
knowledge, these are not accounted for in WordNet.
This limitation is also present in the open access
French version of the Princeton WordNet, WOLF
(Sagot and Fiˇser, 2012). This limitation has led
projects extending WordNet to other languages, like
EuroWordNet, ItalWordNet or WordNet.PT, to add
a few more relations to account for this diversity
(Alonge et al., 2000; Marrafa and Mendes, 2006;
Vossen, 2002). The number of new relations is how-
ever limited. As can be seen, WordNet-type ap-
proaches focus on relating adjectival synsets using
a few semantic relations, mostly antonymy and plain
related to relations.
Our goal is to achieve a finer, and thus richer, se-
mantic characterization of the relations holding be-
tween French adjectives and other words from all
syntactic categories using the formalism of lexical
functions. We assume that the type of the adjective is
reflected in the structure of its lexicographic defini-
tion. Thus, to extract semantically relevant informa-
tion from adjectival definitions, we propose to create
different types of rules accounting for this diversity
of defining structures.
Formalized French lexicons contain rather limited
adjectival data. One can cite the morphological lex-
icon that links French denominal adjectives to the
nouns they are derived from (Strnadov`a and Sagot,
2011) or the syntactic characterization of French ad-
jectives based on an automatic extraction of subcat-
egorization frames proposed in Kup´s´c (2008). Our
method is meant to complete this set of resources
with an adjectival lexicon that is not limited to cer-
tain types of adjectives (like descriptive or denom-
inal) nor to morphologically related adjectives, and
which provides semantic information.

3 Method and Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999215">
The method we use to extract formalized semantic
information from unformalized lexicographic defi-
nitions follows two steps : extracting relations be-
tween defined adjectives and elements of their def-
initions using lexico-syntactic rules (section 3.1)
and mapping these relations to regular relations that
can be expressed in terms of lexical functions (sec-
tion 3.2).

The dictionary used in this project is the Tr´esor de la
langue franc¸aise informatis´e2 (TLFi). It is the elec-
tronic version of a 100,000 word lexicographic dic-
tionary of 19th and 20th century French, the Tr´esor
de la langue franc¸aise (Dendien and Pierrel, 2003).
The TLFi contains a total of 13,513 adjectival
entries, among which 6,425 entries correspond to
mere adjectives and 7,088 to adjectives and other
parts of speech (generally nouns)3. Each of these
entries includes one or more definitions, which add
up to 44,410 definitions, among which 32,475 are
estimated to be adjectival. This approximation is
obtained after filtering out 11,935 non-adjectival
definitions from the mixed entries using a lexico-
syntactic definition parsing program aimed at detect-
ing nominal definitions. The remaining definitions
are mostly adjectival, with exceptions due to more
complex definition structures that are not accounted
for by the filtering method. Table 1 sums up the main
figures.

A lexico-syntactic rule extracts from a definition
the &lt;rel&gt; and &lt;arg&gt; elements. As can be seen
in figure 1, each lexico-syntactic rule is composed
of a left-hand side (LHS) containing either a lexi-
cal unit (lex), such as qui, or a POS tag (cat) like
v (verb), both of which can be optional (op=&amp;quot;y&amp;quot;),
and a right-hand side (RHS) specifying which ele-
ments of the LHS are to be extracted as semanti-
cally relevant: a relation (REL) and/or an argument
(ARG)5.
In figure 1, the denominal rule 2.2 identifies
adjectival definitions corresponding to the lexico-
syntactic pattern stated by the LHS of the rule, such
as that of the adjective RETENU in example 2 above6.
The LHS contains nine elements, where the first two
correspond to lexical items and the remaining ones
to POS tags. Five elements are marked as optional,
since a definition may for example start by the for-
mula Qui est (Which/Who is) followed by some verb,
or it may directly begin with a verb. This verb has to
be followed by a noun (nc) and a preposition (prep),
which may be followed by a determinant and/or an
adjective, but which has to be followed by a noun,
etc. The RHS of the rule states that the relation to
be extracted corresponds to elements 3, 4 and 5 of
5For definitions by synonymy, only the argument is speci-
fied, the default semantic relation being synonymy.
6Note that the adjective RETENU (retained) is, morpholog-
ically speaking, not a denominal. However, the rule extracts
a noun to which this adjective is related in its definition, i.e.
MOD´ERATION (moderation). It is, therefore, the rule that is con-
sidered denominal.

The relation extraction program reads the dictio-
nary definition from the beginning of the sentence
checking whether it contains the elements specified
in the LHS of the rule. In case the rule matches
the lexico-syntactic elements composing the defini-
tion, it outputs the lexical elements of the defini-
tion corresponding to the lexical or syntactic infor-
mation specified in the RHS of the rule in the form
REL(ARG)=ADJ, where ADJ stands for the adjec-
tive of the dictionary entry. For instance, applying
the rule from figure 1 to the definition of the adjec-
tive RETENU returns the relation fait preuve de and
the argument mod´eration (example 2).
A total of 109 lexico-syntactic rules have been de-
signed. These rules cover 76.1 % of the adjectival
definitions (24,716/32,475 definitions). The rules

3.2 Formalizing Paradigmatic Relations with
Lexical Functions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897333333333">
Lexical functions (LF) are a formal tool designed
to describe all types of genuine lexical relations
(paradigmatic and syntactic ones) between lexical
units of any language (Mel’ˇcuk, 1996). Some of the
standard lexical functions that often return adjectival
values are briefly presented below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998519">
• A0 – This paradigmatic lexical function returns the
adjective that semantically corresponds to the argu-
ment. E.g. A0(CHAT) = F´ELIN (A0(cat) =feline);
A0(CRIME) = CRIMINEL (A0(crime) = criminal)
• A1/A2 – These paradigmatic lexical functions re-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.617988">
turn the adjectives that typically characterize, re-
spectively, the first and second argument of the
predicate given as argument to the functions. This
predicate can be nominal, adjectival or verbal.
For example, given that the nominal predicate
D´ECEPTION (disappointment) has two arguments,
the person that is disappointed and the reason of the
disappointment, function A1 applied to D´ECEPTION
returns the adjective D´EC¸U (disappointed), while
function A2 returns D´ECEVANT (disappointing).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.69904475">
E.g. A1(D´ECEPTION) = D´EC¸U (A2(disappointment)
= disappointed); A2(D´ECEPTION) = D´ECEVANT
(A2(disappointment) = disappointing)
(7)
</equation>
<page confidence="0.979581">
164
</page>
<listItem confidence="0.985375727272727">
• Able1/Able2 – Closely related to A1 and A2, these
functions return the adjective that means that the
first (Able1) or the second (Able2) argument of the
predicate P “might P or is likely to P” (whereas
A1 just means “arg1 that P” and A2 “arg2 that
is P-ed”). E.g. Able1(CRAINDRE) = PEUREUX
(Able1(to fear) = coward); Able2(CRAINDRE) =
EFFRAYANT (Able2(to fear) =frightening)
• Magn – This function returns an intensificator of
the predicate. This intensificator can modify the
argument, as in heavy rain (Magn expresses then
a syntagmatic relation), or can be another adjec-
tive that intensifies the meaning of the argument
(Magn expresses then a paradigmatic relation). E.g.
Magn(MAUVAIS) = AFFREUX (Magn(bad) = awful)
• Anti – This function returns the argument’s
antonym(s). E.g. Anti(ABSENT) = PR´ESENT
(Anti(absent) = present)
• AntiA1 – This complex lexical function returns
the adjective that means that the first argument of
the predicate P “is not P (anymore)”. E.g. An-
tiA1(FAIM) = REPU (AntiA1(hunger) = full)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916789473684">
We use this formalism to describe the paradig-
matic relations between adjectives and the argu-
ments extracted in the previous step. These rela-
tions are formulated in a non-systematic way in the
TLFi’s definitions. Definitions in traditional dictio-
naries are written in natural language and, thus, are
not formal enough to be used as such, for example,
in NLP tasks. In order to formalize the lexicon, a
mapping is done between lexical functions describ-
ing paradigmatic relations and the different ways of
expressing these relations in the TLFi’s definitions
(see relation types in example 7), as illustrated in ta-
ble 2.
This REL-LF mapping covers 67.3 % of the ex-
tracted relations (16,646/24,716 extracted relations).
Table 3 shows the complete list of lexical functions
used in our lexicon and their distribution: the three
lexical functions A0, A1 and QSyn represent around
90 % of the relations.

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999869456521739">
If the reference triplets marked “Impossible”
(Imp.) are excluded, this evaluation shows that the
simple rule-based system proposed to extract seman-
tically relevant information from lexicographic def-
initions of adjectives covers 35.8 % of the 137 ref-
erence triplets that can be used for the evaluation.
The analysis of the 88 “No” cases shows that most
of the problems are due to insufficient rule-coverage
and/or REL-LF mapping (37.5 %, 33/88). This fig-
ure could be reduced by further analyzing the def-
initions that are not accounted for by the rules in
order to add more rules, and by mapping more lex-
icalized relations to LFs. The latter solution might,
however, prove difficult due to the high frequency
of reduced- or single-occurrence relations extracted.
30.7 % (27/88) of the “No” cases correspond to a
difference in LFs and 31.8 % (28/88) to either ill-
formed arguments or to new variant-triplets. A man-
ual check of the 53 hypothesis triplets extracted for
the 28 adjectives of the latter types of cases shows
that in only 12 cases the hypothesis arguments are
ill-formed (corresponding to 6/28 reference triplets);
the rest corresponds to, a priori, acceptable argu-
ments, i.e. to new triplet variants (41/53 cases), al-
though a few of them are technically speaking ill-
formed. Therefore, most of the remaining 55.7 %
(49/88) “No” cases should be qualitatively evalu-
ated.
These mitigated quantitative results have to be put
in perspective. The first evaluation was meant to test
the performance of the extraction rules against data
from an existing resource, but, as the figures show,
the vast majority of the reference triplets cannot be
tested. This quantitative evaluation thus highlights
the difficulty of using existing resources for this
kind of task (particularly when such resources are
scarce). Moreover, it proves insufficient to measure
the actual performance of the rules. Two types of
cases are indeed unaccounted for: first, there might
be many correct hypothesis triplets that are not in
the reference, since there is a huge discrepancy in
the number of triplets between the reference and the
hypotheses; second, the hypothesis triplets that don’t
match to the reference might still be correct. There-
fore, other qualitative evaluation methods have to be
used.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967911111111">
In this article, we presented a rule-based method
to automatically extract paradigmatic relations from
lexicographic definitions of adjectives using lexico-
syntactic patterns. This method was completed with
a manual mapping of the most frequently extracted
lexicalized relations (which are quite heterogenous)
to formal lexical functions. Our goal is to automati-
cally create a formalized semantic lexicon of French
adjectives that would be complementary to the few
existing adjectival resources that can be used, for
instance, in NLP tasks. The adjectival lexicon, in
which each adjective is related by a lexical func-
tion to an NP/VP/adjectival/adverbial argument, was
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated.
The first evaluation, entirely automatic, was
aimed at testing the performance of the method. It
yielded rather inconclusive results mainly due to the
scarcity of the external data available for the task. A
thorough analysis of the different types of “errors”
showed that the number of “technical problems”
can be reduced by refining the extraction rules, by
adding more of them, and by completing the map-
ping of extracted relations to LFs. It also highlighted
the necessity to evaluate the method qualitatively.
The second evaluation was, thus, aimed at rating the
acceptability of the extracted relations. It was real-
ized by an expert of the lexical functions formalism
and gave good results, with a precision of around
70 %.
The automatically created adjectival lexicon pre-
sented in this paper can be easily extended by
a straightforward inversion of the LF(ARG)=ADJ
triplets. The resulting triplets would either complete
existing lexical entries if integrated into a similarly
encoded nominal and verbal lexicon, or constitute
new entries in the adjectival lexicon, thus extend-
ing the syntactic categories represented in the lexi-
con. The LF formalism could also be used to further
enrich adjectival entries by making automatic infer-
ences between adjective-argument pairs and their re-
spective synonyms. E.g. infer A0(kitty)=feline from
A0(cat)=feline and syn(cat)=kitty. Finally, mapping
LFs with the existing relations in WordNet could al-
low to integrate this adjectival lexicon to the French
WOLF.

It is the electronic version of a 100,000 word lexicographic dictionary of 19th and 20th century French, the Tr´esor de la langue franc¸aise (Dendien and Pierrel, 2003). The TLFi contains a total of 13,513 adjectival entries, among which 6,425 entries correspond to mere adjectives and 7,088 to adjectives and other parts of speech (generally nouns)3. Each of these entries includes one or more definitions, which add up to 44,410 definitions, among which 32,475 are estimated to be adjectival. This approximation is obtained after filtering out 11,935 non-adjectival definitions from the mixed entries using a lexicosyntactic definition parsing program aimed at detecting nominal definitions.

We conclude on some perspectives for future work. 2 Related Work It is well established that there are different types of adjectives distinguished by properties, such as gradation and markedness, and by their semantic and syntactic behaviors (antonymy, selectional preferences) (Fellbaum et al., 1993; Raskin and Nirenburg, 1996). WordNet, for example, distinguishes different types of adjectives according to their semantic and syntactic behaviors: descriptive, reference-modifying, color and relational adjectives (Fellbaum et al., 1993). However, it mainly accounts for the first and the last types of adjectives.

Finally, in section 4, we present a quantitative evaluation of our method and a qualitative evaluation of our data, and discuss their results. We conclude on some perspectives for future work. 2 Related Work It is well established that there are different types of adjectives distinguished by properties, such as gradation and markedness, and by their semantic and syntactic behaviors (antonymy, selectional preferences) (Fellbaum et al., 1993; Raskin and Nirenburg, 1996). WordNet, for example, distinguishes different types of adjectives according to their semantic and syntactic behaviors: descriptive, reference-modifying, color and relational adjectives (Fellbaum et al., 1993). However, it mainly accounts for the first and the last types of adjectives.

Fellbaum et al. (1993:36) acknowledge the existence of more diverse relations to nominal synsets, but, to our knowledge, these are not accounted for in WordNet. This limitation is also present in the open access French version of the Princeton WordNet, WOLF (Sagot and Fiˇser, 2012). This limitation has led projects extending WordNet to other languages, like EuroWordNet, ItalWordNet or WordNet.PT, to add a few more relations to account for this diversity (Alonge et al., 2000; Marrafa and Mendes, 2006; Vossen, 2002).
