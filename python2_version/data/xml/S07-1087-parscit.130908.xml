<bodyText confidence="0.9999171875">
SenseClusters is a freely–available open–
source system that served as the Univer-
sity of Minnesota, Duluth entry in the
SENSEVAL-4 sense induction task. For this
task SenseClusters was configured to con-
struct representations of the instances to be
clustered using the centroid of word co-
occurrence vectors that replace the words
in an instance. These instances are then
clustered using k–means where the number
of clusters is discovered automatically using
the Adapted Gap Statistic. In these experi-
ments SenseClusters did not use any infor-
mation outside of the raw untagged text that
was to be clustered, and no tuning of the sys-
tem was performed using external corpora.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999137">
The object of the sense induction task of
SENSEVAL-4 (Agirre and Soroa, 2007) was to
cluster 27,132 instances of 100 different words
(35 nouns and 65 verbs) into senses or classes.
The task data consisted of the combination of the
test and training data (minus the sense tags) from
the English lexical sample task. Each instance is
a context of several sentences which contains an
occurrence of a given word that serves as the target
of sense induction.
SenseClusters is based on the presumption that
words that occur in similar contexts will have similar
meanings. This intuition has been presented as both
the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1968) and the
Strong Contextual Hypothesis (Miller and Charles,
1991).
SenseClusters has been in active development at
the University of Minnesota, Duluth since 2002. It is
an open–source project that is freely–available from
sourceforge, and has been been described in detail
in numerous publications (e.g., (Purandare and Ped-
ersen, 2004), (Pedersen et al., 2005), (Pedersen and
Kulkarni, 2007)).
SenseClusters supports a variety of techniques for
selecting lexical features, representing contexts to
be clustered, determining the appropriate number of
cluster automatically, clustering, labeling of clus-
ters, and evaluating cluster quality. The configu-
ration used in SENSEVAL-4 was just one possible
combination of these techniques.

2 Methodology in Sense Induction Task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997559375">
For this task, SenseClusters represents the instances
to be clustered using second order co–occurrence
vectors. These are constructed by first identifying
word co–occurrences, and then replacing each word
in an instance to be clustered with its co-occurrence
vector. Then all the vectors that make up an instance
are averaged together to represent that instance.
A co–occurrence matrix is constructed by identi-
fying bigrams that occur in the contexts to be clus-
tered two or more times and have a Pointwise Mu-
tual Information (PMI) score greater than five. If the
value of PMI is near 1.0, this means that the words in
the bigram occur together approximately the num-
ber of times expected by chance, and they are not
strongly associated. If this value is greater than 1,
then the words in the bigram are occurring more of-

ten than expected by chance, and they are therefore
associated.
The rows of the co–occurrence matrix represent
the first word in the selected bigrams, and the
columns represent the second word. A window size
of 12 is allowed, which means that up to 10 inter-
vening words can be observed between the pair of
words in the bigram. This rather large window size
was employed since the sample sizes for each word
were relatively small, often no more than a few hun-
dred instances.
A stop list was used to eliminate bigrams where
either word is a high–frequency low–content word.
The particular list used is distributed with the Ngram
Statistics Package and is loosely based on the
SMART stop list. It consists of 295 words; in addi-
tion, all punctuation, single letter words, and num-
bers (with the exception of years) were eliminated.
Each of the contexts that contain a particular tar-
get word is represented by a single vector that is the
average (or the centroid) of all the co-occurrence
vectors found for the words that make up the con-
text. This results in a context by feature matrix,
where the features are the words that occur with
the words in the contexts (i.e., second order co–
occurrences). The k–means algorithm is used for
clustering the contexts, where the number of clus-
ters is automatically discovered using the Adapted
Gap Statistic (Pedersen and Kulkarni, 2006). The
premise of this method is to create a randomized
sample of data with the same characteristics of the
observed data (i.e., the contexts to be clustered).
This is done by fixing the marginal totals of the con-
text by feature matrix and then generating random-
ized values that are consistent with those marginal
totals. This creates a matrix that is can be viewed
as being from the same population as the observed
data, except that the data is essentially noise (be-
cause it is randomly generated).
The randomized data is clustered for successive
values of k from 1 to some upper limit (the num-
ber of contexts or the point at which the criterion
functions have plateaued). For each value of k the
criterion function measures the quality of the clus-
tering solution. The same is done for that observed
data, and the difference between the criterion func-
tion for the observed data and the randomized data
is determined, and the value of k where that differ-
ence is largest is selected as the best solution for k,
since that is when the clustered data least resembles
noise, and is therefore the most organized or best
solution. In these experiments the criterion function
was intra-cluster similarity.

3 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949428571429">
There was an unsupervised and a supervised eval-
uation performed in the sense induction task. Of-
ficial scores were reported for 6 participating sys-
tems, plus the most frequent sense (MFS) baseline,
so rankings (when available) are provided from 1
(HIGH) to 7 (LOW). We also conducted an evalu-
ation using the SenseClusters method.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993205">
3.1 Unsupervised Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937967741935">
The unsupervised evaluation was based on the tradi-
tional clustering measures of F-score, entropy, and
purity. While the participating systems clustered the
full 27,132 instances, only the 4,581 instance subset
that corresponds to the English lexical sample eval-
uation data was scored in the evaluation. Table 1
shows the averaged F-scores over all 100 words, all
35 nouns, and all 65 verbs.
In this table the SenseClusters system (UMND2)
is compared to the MFS baseline, which is attained
by assigning all the instances of a word to a sin-
gle cluster. We also include several random base-
lines, where randomX indicates that one of X pos-
sible clusters was randomly assigned to each in-
stance of a word. Thus, approximately 100 * X
distinct clusters are created across the 100 words.
The random results are not ranked as they were not
a part of the official evaluation. We also present the
highest (HIGH, rank 1) and lowest (LOW, rank 7)
scores from participating systems, to provide points
of comparison.
The randomX baseline is useful in determining
the sensitivity of the evaluation technique to the
number of clusters discovered. The average num-
ber of classes in the gold standard test data is 2.9, so
random3 approximates a system that randomly as-
signs the correct number of clusters. It attains an
F-score of 50.0. Note that random2 performs some-
what better (59.7), suggesting that all other things
being equal, the F-score is biased towards methods
that find a smaller than expected number of clusters.

As the number of random clusters increases the F-
score declines sharply, showing that it is highly sen-
sitive to the number of clusters discovered, and sig-
nificantly penalizes systems that find more clusters
than indicated in the gold standard data.
We observed for UMND2 that purity (81.7) is
quite a bit higher than the F-score (66.1), and that
it discovered a smaller number of clusters on aver-
age (1.4) than exists in the gold standard data (2.9).
This shows that while SenseClusters was able to find
relatively pure clusters, it errored in finding too few
clusters, and was therefore penalized to some degree
by the F-score.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998705">
3.2 Supervised Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99958385">
A supervised evaluation was also carried out on
the same clustering of the 27,132 instances as was
used in the unsupervised evaluation, following the
method defined in (Agirre et al., 2006). Here the
train portion (22,281 instances) is used to learn a ta-
ble of probabilities that is used to map discovered
clusters in the test data to gold standard classes. The
cluster assigned to each instance in the test portion
(4,851 instances) is mapped (assigned) to the most
probable class associated with that cluster as defined
by this table.
After this transformation is performed, the newly
mapped test results are scored using the scorer2 pro-
gram, which is the official evaluation program of
the English lexical sample task and reports the F-
measure, which in these experiments is simply ac-
curacy since precision and recall are the same.
In Table 2 we show the results of the super-
vised evaluation, which includes the highest and
lowest score from participating systems, as well as

UMND2, MFS, and the same randomX baselines as
included in the unsupervised evaluation.
We observed that the difference between the score
of the best performing system (HIGH) and the ran-
dom50 baseline is six points (81.6 - 75.6). In the
unsupervised evaluation of this same data this dif-
ference is 61 points (78.9 - 17.9) according to the
F-score.
The smaller range of values for the supervised
measure can be understood by noting that the map-
ping operation alters the number and distribution of
clusters as discovered in the test data. For exam-
ple, random3 results in an average of 2.9 clusters per
word in the test data, but after mapping the average
number of clusters is 1.1. The average number of
clusters discovered by UMND2 is 1.4, but after map-
ping this average is reduced to 1.1. For random50,
the average number of clusters per word is 24.1, but
after mapping is 2.0. This shows that the super-
vised evaluation has a tendency to converge upon
the MFS, which corresponds to assigning 1 cluster
per word.
When looking at the randomX results in the su-
pervised evaluation, it appears that this method does
not penalize systems for getting the number of clus-
ters incorrect (as the F-score does). This is shown by
the very similar results for the randomX baselines,
where the only difference in their results is the num-
ber of clusters. This lack of a penalty is due to the
fact that the mapping operation takes a potentially
large number of clusters and maps them to relatively
few classes (e.g., random50) and then performs the
evaluation.

3.3 SenseClusters Evaluation (F-Measure)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984043478261">
An evaluation was carried out on the full 27,132
instance train+test data set using the SenseClusters
evaluation methodology, which was first defined in
(Pedersen and Bruce, 1997). This corresponds to
an unsupervised version of the F-measure, which
in these experiments can be viewed as an accuracy
measure since precision and recall are the same (as
is the case for the supervised measure).
It aligns discovered clusters with classes such that
their agreement is maximized. The clusters and
classes must be aligned one to one, so a large penalty
can result if the number of discovered clusters dif-
fers from the number of gold standard classes.1
For UMND2, there were 145 discovered clusters
and 368 gold standard classes. Due to the one to
one alignment that is required, the 145 discovered
clusters were aligned with 145 gold standard classes
such that there was agreement for 15,291 of 27,132
instances, leading to an F-measure (accuracy) of
56.36 percent. Note that this is significantly lower
than the F-score of UMND2 for the train+test data,
which was 63.1. This illustrates that the SenseClus-
ters F-measure and the F-score are not equivalent.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994256736842105">
One of the strengths of SenseClusters (UMND2) is
that it is able to automatically identify the number of
clusters without any manual intervention or setting
of parameters. In these experiments the Adapted
Gap statistic was quite conservative, only discover-
ing on average 1.4 classs per word, where the ac-
tual number of classes in the gold standard data was
2.9. However, this is a reasonable result, since for
many words there were just a few hundred instances.
Also, the gold standard class distinctions were heav-
ily skewed, with the majority sense occurring 80%
of the time on average. Under such conditions,
there may not be sufficient information available for
an unsupervised clustering algorithm to make fine
grained distinctions, and so discovering one cluster
for a word may be a better course of action that mak-
ing divisions that are not well supported by the data.
&apos;An implementation of this measure is available in the
SenseClusters system, or by contacting the author.

Each of the contexts that contain a particular target word is represented by a single vector that is the average (or the centroid) of all the co-occurrence vectors found for the words that make up the context. This results in a context by feature matrix, where the features are the words that occur with the words in the contexts (i.e., second order co– occurrences). The k–means algorithm is used for clustering the contexts, where the number of clusters is automatically discovered using the Adapted Gap Statistic (Pedersen and Kulkarni, 2006). The premise of this method is to create a randomized sample of data with the same characteristics of the observed data (i.e., the contexts to be clustered). This is done by fixing the marginal totals of the context by feature matrix and then generating randomized values that are consistent with those marginal totals. This creates a matrix that is can be viewed as being from the same population as the observed data, except that the data is essentially noise (because it is randomly generated). The randomized data is clustered for successive values of k from 1 to some upper limit (the number of</context>

SenseClusters is based on the presumption that words that occur in similar contexts will have similar meanings. This intuition has been presented as both the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1968) and the Strong Contextual Hypothesis (Miller and Charles, 1991). SenseClusters has been in active development at the University of Minnesota, Duluth since 2002. It is an open–source project that is freely–available from sourceforge, and has been been described in detail in numerous publications (e.g., (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), (Pedersen et al., 2005), (Pedersen and Kulkarni, 2007)). SenseClusters supports a variety of techniques for selecting lexical features, representing contexts to be clustered, determining the appropriate number of cluster automatically, clustering, labeling of clusters, and evaluating cluster quality. The configuration used in SENSEVAL-4 was just one possible combination of these techniques. 2 Methodology in Sense Induction Task For this task, SenseClusters represents the instances to be clustered using second order co–occurrence vectors.
