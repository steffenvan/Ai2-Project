Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999923">
In this paPer we outline an interlingual-
based procedure for resolving reference
and suggest a practical approach to
implementing it. We assume a two-stage
language analysis system. First, a
syntactic analysis of an input text results
in a functional structure in which certain
cases of pronominal reference are
resolved. Second, the f-structure is
mapped onto an interlingual
representation. As part of this mapping,
the reference of the various f-structure
elements is resolved resulting in the
addition of information to certain
existing IL objects (coreference) or in
the creation of new IL objects which are
added to the domain of discourse (initial
reference).
For this effort, we adopt Text Meaning
Representation for our IL and rely on the
ONTOS ontology (Mahesh &amp; Nirenburg,
1995) as a general knowledge base.
Since the central barrier to developing
such a system today is the
incompleteness of the knowledge base,
we outline a strategy starting with the
implementation of a series of form-based
resolution algorithms that are applied
directly to the referring expressions of
the input text. These are initially
supplemented by a knowledge-based
resolution procedure which, as the
knowledge base grows and the adequacy
of the f-structure and IL-representation
increases, takes on more and more of the
processing load.

This paper describes a practical approach to
implementing an interlingual-based reference
resolution procedure. This effort is part of a
recently initiated research project at the
Computing Research Laboratory at New
Mexico State University which aims to
develop a system that will automatically
construct an epistemic knowledge base from
text. The procedure will also support machine
translation (e.g., Mikrokosmos, see
Onyshkevych &amp; Nirenburg, 1994; Carlson &amp;
Nirenburg, 1990) as well as other multilingual
NLP tasks. Since the system itself is in the
early stages of development, descriptions of
performance are projected rather than actual.
Current approaches to reference resolution
focus on surface forms (see Sundheim &amp;.
Grishman, 1995, and MUC-7, 1998, for a
general introduction). They include string
match algorithms for proper noun phrases
(PNs) and common noun phrases (NPs) (e.g.,
Bagga &amp; Baldwin, 1998) and syntactically
constrained morphological matching for
pronominals and deictic NPs (Lappin &amp; Leass,
1994). In some cases, they include constraints
related to clause structure or larger textual
units (e.g., Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995).
They do not generally consider implicit
references or, in the case of Spanish (e.g.,
Ferrandez et al, 1998), references to
contextually clear possessors using determiners
rather than possessive adjectives. All such
approaches are supplemented, if not entirely
determined, by heuristics which, more
recently, have been induced statistically, from
corpora (e.g., Hirschman et al, 1998, Popescu-
Bells, 1998). The only approaches of which the
authors are aware that attempted to account for
implicit referents or implicit references are
those developed within Al over two decades
ago (e.g., Hobbs, 1979, or DeJong, 1979).
This approach suggested here differs
radically in that reference resolution is
triggered by elements of interlingual (IL)
representation rather than surface text
expressions. The referents in the domain of
discourse consist of elements of IL
representation as well. Thus, implicit
references and implicit referents are accounted
for and, at the same time, empty references are
ignored.
Below, in Section 2, we outline a proposal
for practically implementing an 1L-based
approach, beginning with a description of a
target procedure which resolves the reference
of each new IL element as it is being produced,
clause by clause. We then present a series of
form-based procedures, which are to be
gradually replaced (or, in some cases,
transmogrified) as the IL analysis system and
supporting knowledge bases are extended. In
Section 3, we briefly describe the relevant
aspects of the sample Spanish used as a basis
for the presentation. In Section 4, we examine
the operation of the procedures in greater detail
and demonstrate how the IL-based approach
can resolve those problematic references that
are beyond the scope of the form-based
approaches.

2 Resolution Procedures
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.981957">
2.1 IL-based Resolution Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954991309090909">
The proposed approach relies on the capability
of a system to provide a reasonably adequate
interlingual representation for a text. Here the
interlingua we rely on is a variant of Text
Meaning Representation (TMR) (see
http://crl.nmsu.edu/Research/Projectsimikro/in
dex.html) and we focus on a sample Spanish
text and its interlingual analysis, which is
known to be reproducible automatically.
The first step of the analysis process is to
produce a functional (syntactic) structure for
the text. As part of the process of establishing
the f-structure, various structurally governed,
clause and sentence internal anaphoric
relations will be resolved, the relevant
anaphors being coindexed (or assigned
differing indexes) as determined by the syntax.
Thus some syntactic co-reference relationships
such as those related to clitics and relative
pronouns will be identified before the IL
procedure begins.
The second step is to map from the f-
structure to the TMR. A TME. includes, among
other representational objects, instantiations of
object types, relation types and property types.
These are constructed from ontological
concepts which are associated with the lexical
items in f-structure and which are filled out on
the basis of the surrounding f-structure.
For instance, the Spanish verb comprar (to
buy) might be associated with the ontological
concept named PURCHASE which is a
generic frame structure corresponding to
purchasing events. It might in part look like:
TIME: T [time]
LOCATION: L [place]
PURCHASE
AGENT: P [human/organization]
THEME: 0 [object]
SOURCE: S [human/organization]
AMOUNT: C [currency]
etc.
where TIME, LOCATION, AGENT, THEME,
human, organization, object, etc. are all
ontological concepts. On some particular use
of comprar in a text (or more specifically in
the f-structure representation of a text), the
PURCHASE frame is called forth and
instantiated, i.e., indexed and filled in with
instantiated representational objects derived
from other ontological concepts associated
with other lexical items of the surrounding 1-
structure.
For instance, if the f-structure in question is
for:
</bodyText>

</page>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.247832">
Roche compra Docteur Andreu
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8583569">
Roche and Docteur Andreu will each be
associated with and instantiate an ontological
concept for COMPANY. Such a
representational element might look like:
COMPANY
NAME: N [text]
HEADQUARTERS: H [office]
BRANCHES: B [set:office]
SUBSIDIARIES: S [set:company]
EMPLOYEES: E [set:human]
SALES: V [currency]
PROFITS: P. [currency],
etc.
where NAME, HEADQUARTERS,
BRANCH, text, office, etc. are all ontological
concepts. This frame is instantiated according
to the f-structure context for each of the two
proper names and then the instantiated frames
are inserted (actually indexed) appropriately in
the PURCHASE frame. The result is:

<figure confidence="0.55369825">

<bodyText confidence="0.999955064516129">
These instantiated representational objects are,
in turn, referents in the discourse context when
the next sentence is processed. As part of this
mapping, the reference of the various f-
structure elements is resolved resulting in the
addition of information to certain existing IL
objects (coreference) or in the creation of new
IL objects which are added to the domain of
discourse (initial reference). Which occurs
depends on whether a connection can be
inferred between the current IL object and an
already-existing IL object on the basis of
ontological or epistemie information.
Note that reference resolution is driven by
the process of instantiating TMR objects rather
than by linguistic forms. At the same time,
various aspects of reference resolution are
being done on the basis of form. Certain
anaphors are coindexed or differently indexed
on the basis of morphosyntax as the f-structure
is being constructed. Ontological concepts of
similar or related type may be called forth
during the mapping of similar or related lexical
items onto TMR. Articles and other
determiners affect the form of the instantiated
TMR objects corresponding to the NPs
containing them. Finally, aspects of the
instantiated TMR objects refer to literals such
as the NAME attribute of a COMPANY.
These can be used to implement string-
matching algorithms.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999977">
2.2 Approach to Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999512">
Because the target procedure relies on a highly
sophisticated, and as yet incomplete, language
analysis system, the approach to implementing
it begins by assuming that none of the IL
apparatus is available for processing. Instead,
we implement an initial set of standard, form-
based algorithms which vary according to the
syntactic category of referring expression.
Generally, if the referring expression is a
proper noun phrase, a full or partial string
match with each prior PN is used to establish a
coreference link. Otherwise, the PN is assumed
to refer to a new referent. For standard
pronorninals, a recency algorithm is used
which checks the morphosyntactic constraints
(gender, number, etc.) and, if possible, the
semantic class to filter potential coreferents.
When a match is found, the coreference link is
established. Common noun phrases follow a
bifurcated algorithm. If the noun phrase is
indefinite or has no article, then it is assumed
to refer to a new referent. If it is a definite
noun phrase, then the head noun string is
matched against that of previous NPs. If the
heads of two NPs match and the complement

<bodyText confidence="0.996026285714286">
strings do not mismatch, the two NPs are
assumed to corefer.
As the IL analysis system and supporting
knowledge bases grow and the ability to
produce appropriate f-structures and TMRs is
extended, the target procedures will bear
increasingly more of the resolution task.

3 The Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985499695652174">
For this presentation, we focus the discussion
on a single Spanish text, a newswire article
concerning a corporate buyout (see Appendix I
for the original text and its translation into
English). It. is taken from the ARPA Machine
Translation Evaluation corpus (White et al,
1994) and contains 347 words, 17 sentences
and 11 paragraphs.
There are 144 referring expressions
altogether including 14 proper noun phrases
(9.7%), 76 common noun phrases (52.8%), 20
pronominal-like expressions (13.9%), 31
verbal expressions (21.5%) and 3 prepositional
phrases (2.1%). Of the common noun phrases
(NP), 43 were definite NPs, 8 were indefinite
NPs and 25 NPs had no explicit determiner. Of
the pronominal expressions, 12 were pronouns
(Pron) or deictics such as hoy (today), aqui
(here) or ahora (now), 3 were ellipted (subject)
pronouns (PRO) and 5 were definite articles
which function as possessive adjectives (Det
Prot* as in:
El beneficio neto ... se elevO
The[= Its] net profits ... increased ....
However, there are in addition 129 implicit
references made which need to be resolved as
well. Implicit references are those that are
implied by the slots of TMR objects. They may
be of unexpressed participants of an event (say,
a seller in a PURCHASE event), or
unexpressed times or locations of events.
Altogether, then, there are 273 references of
which 52.75% are explicit and an almost equal
amount, 47.25%, are implicit. Taking the
implicit references into account, the proper
noun phrases (PN) represent 5.1% of the
referring expressions, the common noun
phrases NP about 27.8%, pronominal-like
expressions 7.3%, verbal expressions 11.4%
and prepositional phrases about 1.1%. These
results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
As for referents, there are 138 altogether. Of
these 108 (78.25%) are referred to explicitly
on at least one occasion while 30 (21.75%) are
referred to implicitly only. There are 40 (29%)
referents that are referred to more than once, of

which 31 (77.5%) are explicitly referred to at

Thus, there were 135 coreferences altogether
(273 total references — 138 referents), 41
explicit coreferences and 94 implicit
coreferences. Of the explicit coreferences, 9
were made by PNs, 10 by NPs, 20 by
pronominal-like expressions (12 by Prons, 3 by
PROs, 5 by Dets [= Pronl) and 2 by verbal
expressions.
It is perhaps of some interest that very few of
these references were figurative, that is,
metonymic or metaphorical. There was one
clearly metonymic reference, and one or two
other possible metonymic references.

4 Reference Resolution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963">
What follows here is a discussion of what is
needed to resolve the 273 references made in
the example Spanish text. In each section, the
cases that could be handled by a form-based
method are discussed, then cases that would
require an IL-based approach for resolution.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999907">
4.1 Resolving Proper Noun Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967684134615385">
As mentioned, there are 14 PNs in the sample
text, 9.7% of the explicit referring expressions
or 5.1% of all references. In addition, there
were 4 cases of common noun phrases which
were in apposition with proper noun phrases
and which will be considered here as well.
For PNs, the basic resolution strategy is to
match the form of the expression with that of
each of the PNs used previously. If there is a
match, assume the current PN is being used to
corefer to the referent of the matching PN.
This applies in 4 of 18 cases. If no match is
found, attempt a partial positive form match.
That is, if any part of either form for which
there is a partial match does not match a
corresponding substring in the other form, then
the match fails. Thus, El grupo Roche matches
Roche and Productos Roche SA also matches
Roche because there is no substring of the
phrase Roche that does not match with El
grupo or Productos. On the other hand,
Productos Roche SA does NOT match El
grupo Roche because Productos does not
match El grupo. This handles 3 further cases of
the 18 (assuming that having matched El grupo
Roche with Roche, Productos Roche SA will
not match because it does not match with El
grupo Roche).
If no positive partial match can be found, it is
assumed that the PN is not being used to
corder to an existing referent and introduces a
new referent. This takes care of 9 additional
cases.
This basic PN resolution procedure, then,
handles 16 of the 18 PNs (89%). That leaves 2
cases which it will not handle, Doctor Andreu
coreferring to Docteur Andreu and Productos
Roche SA coreferring to su compartia en
Esparta
The second problem is not all that rare.
Here, the PN is being used to corefer to a
referent that was initially introduced by a
common noun phrase. The first step is to
identify the semantic class of the PN, possibly
through some independent PN classifying
procedure or possibly by looking at any
semantic constraints that arise from the
context In the case of Productos Roche SA,
for instance, it might be classed as a
COMPANY by some independent PN
classifying procedure, say, on the basis of the
SA, or by inspecting its context.

Productos Roche SA and Union Explosivo

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999240294117647">
In example (1), the expression la operaciOn is
used to refer to some transaction that, as the
text goes on to report, was carried out between
Productos Roche and Union Explosivos Rio
Tinto. If transactions are carried out by
companies (general semantic knowledge), then
Productos Roche and Union Explosivos must
be companies.
Having established the semantic category of
Productos Roche, the next step is to establish a
plausible connection between Productos Roche
and an established referent of the same
semantic category. That is, the procedure is
now to inspect all the established referents of
the category COMPANY (i.e., the Roche
group, Doctor Andreu and Roche&apos;s company in
Spain). We know from prior text that Roche
bought Doctor Andreu and that Roche
acquired Doctor Andreu through its subsidiary
in Spain (epistemic knowledge). From the
current text, we know that Productos Roche
and Union Explosivos were actually involved
in the transaction and that UniOn Explosive
had been a majority shareholder but, by
implication, no longer is (epistemic
knowledge). Thus, Union Explosivos appears
to be the seller and, by implication, Productos
Roche could be the buyer, i.e., Roche&apos;s
company in Spain.
The same procedure can be used to
establishing that the reference of Doctor
Andreu is the same as that of Doeteter Andreu:
establish the semantic class of Doctor Andreu,
inspect each existing referent of that class to

see whether or not a plausible connection can
be established.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.957591">
4.2 Resolving Pronominals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988222222222">
In the sample Spanish text, there are 19
pronominal expressions, 13.9% of the explicit
referring expressions or 7.3% of all references.
Of these, there are 15 explicit forms and 4
ellipted forms. The 15 explicit forms include 6
possessive pronouns, 4 deictic adverbials and 5
definite articles. The 4 ellipted forms include 3
ellipted subjects of finite verbs and 1 ellipted
head of a relative complementizer.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.9995">
4.2.1 Explicit pronouns
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974780409090909">
The basic form-based strategy for resolving
pronominal reference is to begin by inspecting
in reverse order of mention those referring
expressions whose forms are compatible with
the morphological constraints imposed by the
pronominal. This strategy is usually
constrained by various syntactic heuristics such
as that a non-reflexive pronoun in object
position cannot corefer to the subject or a
pronominal complement of a noun cannot
corefer to the head (e.g., Ferrandez et al,
1998). Such a resolution procedure will
account for 4 of the 6 cases (66%) in the
sample text.
To resolve the remaining cases, it is
necessary to check the referent of the
antecedent to see whether it is semantically
compatible with the contextual function of the
anaphor. So, for instance, in resolving the
reference of su (its, his, her or their) in:
El beneficio neto -el mejor de su
The[---its] net profits the best in its
historia- se elevii a 641,5 millones de
history increased to 641.5 million
francos
Francs ...
the procedure is to first shuffle back through
the referring expressions until a third person
form is encountered. Here, the first third
person referring expression is El beneficio neto
(some company&apos;s net profits). The procedure
next needs to establish through inferencing that
the referent of El beneficio neto can serve the
function of the anaphor su, that is, can have a
history. In this case, a plausible inference
cannot be established, and so the procedure
moves on to consider the next most recently
mentioned referent, the Roche group which is
being referred to by the El of El beneficio neto
which is being used to express a possessor
relation. Here, on the basis of ontological
knowledge about what companies can or
cannot have, su is understood as coreferring to
the referent of El.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.992913">
4.2.2 Eilipted pronominals
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.938736">
For the ellipted pronominals in the sample
Spanish text, syntax will have to identify such
ellipted elements in order to trigger the
reference resolution process. However, once
identified, the basic strategy described above
for explicit pronouns should apply unaltered
although, unlike possessive pronouns, the
morphological constraints of the anaphor must
be extracted from the morphosyntactic context.
So, for instance, the ellipted subject of:
cuenta PRO con compailias en mots
... has companies in more
de 50 paises
than 50 countries ...
must be a third person singular referent (given
the conjugation of the verb cuenta). In this
case, the basic resolution procedure correctly
resolves 2 of the 4 cases (50%).
For the remainder, the semantic function of
the ellipted element is also extracted from
context, i.e., it functions as the subject of
contar con compaiiias (has companies). Thus,
in the example above, it must be something
that can own companies. Among the third
singular candidate expressions, in reverse
order of mention: el diagnostico (diagnosis), la
comercializacicin (the marketing), la
produccidn (the manufacture), el desarrollo
(the development), Basilea (Suiza) (Basel,
Switzerland) and sede central (home office),
none are potential owners of companies. The
next most remote referring expression to be
inspected is el grupo Roche (the Roche Group)
which, as it turns out, is something that can
own companies and, therefore, the PRO is
identified as coreferring to the same referent.

4.2.3 Deictic Elements
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972583333333">
Deictic elements, such as the adverbs hoy
(today), aqui (here), ahora (now), and so on,
are resolved directly to properties of the
utterance context: the day of utterance, the
place of utterance, the time of utterance, and so
on. There were 4 such pronouns in the sample
text, 3 referring (hoy, aqui, ahora&amp;quot;) and I
coreferring (hoy). It should be noted that all
these elements are, in fact, coreferent with
implicit temporal and spatial references of
various finite verbs that are used to report
certain events or states of affairs.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.995752">
4.2.4 Articles with pronominal force
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992296411764706">
Perhaps the most contentious of the
pronominal elements to be discussed here are
the definite.articles of noun phrases which can
be contextually interpreted as having the force
of possessive adjectives. There are 6 examples
of this in the sample text. However, these are
by no means all the definite articles found and,
in addition, of these six example, four were
translated as possessive adjectives, one as a
definite article, the, and one was omitted
altogether in translation. In other words, not
only is an ambiguity introduced for a very
common lexical item, but even when resolved
in favor of the possessor interpretation, it may
not be translated as a possessive adjective. On
the other hand, the major reason for assuming a
distinction is that it is very important to
establish such relationships in order to
understand or translate a document. For
instance, if it is not established that the cash
flow referred to in:
El &amp;quot;cash flow&amp;quot; se incremento en un 21
its cash flow increased by about 21
por ciento
per cent ...
is that of company X, then it will be impossible
to determine whether the cash flow referred to
later in the text in:
.„ y el &amp;quot;cash flow&amp;quot; de
... and its cash flow ...
is that of company X or of some other
company. That means that such information
will not only be unavailable for use during
translation (e.g., selecting a possessive
adjective in the target language) but for any
other purpose that might come along (e.g.,
information extraction).
In any case, the procedure for resolving the
reference of definite articles is the basic
pronominal resolution procedure except that no
morphological constraints can be placed on the
antecedent expression. Still, syntactic
constraints on the antecedent may be applied.
Following this strategy, 5 of the 6 cases (83%)
are resolved correctly although it is not clear
whether it leads to false positives. Otherwise,
potential referents are considered until one is
found which can serve the appropriate
possessor function. Since a positive connection
must be inferred, the likelihood of false
positives is greatly decreased.

4.3 Resolving Common Noun Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964258064516">
If proper noun phrases and pronominals were
the only type of referring expressions, form-
based resolution techniques might prove
sufficient. They account, however, for only
23,6% of the explicit referring expression or
12.4% of all references. It is for the resolution
of common noun phrases, clauses and implicit
references that an interlingual-based procedure
will eventually prove necessary.
There are 76 common noun expressions in
sample Spanish text. Of these 42 are definite
noun phrases (32 referring, 10 coreferring), 9
are indefinite noun phrases (all 9 referring),
and 25 are noun phrases having no article (all
25 referring).
Since none of the indefinite noun phrases or
the noun phrases without articles are used to
corefer, an initial basic resolution strategy for
common noun phrases begins by inspecting the
form of the referring expression. If it is an
indefinite noun phrase or noun phrase without
article, it is assumed to refer to something new
and a new referent is added to the referents in
the domain of discourse. That successfully
resolves the reference of 34 of the 76 common
noun phrases (45%) in the text.
Of the 42 definite noun phrases, 36 are used
to refer (or corefer) to specific individuals or
stuff or are inferrably unique given a general
knowledge of individuals, stuff or situations
that were being discussed. Of these 36, 24
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998771">
7

<bodyText confidence="0.999233896103896">
were used to refer to particular individuals or
stuff, 8 to processes, 2 to particular groups of
objects and 2 to logically unique objects. Of
the remaining 6 definite noun phrases, 4 were
used to refer to portions (percentages) of stuff
and 2 were used to refer to generic classes.
In regard to the resolution of definite noun
phrases, then, the basic strategy is to first
identify whether the expression is being used
to refer to specific individuals or stuff, to
portions (percentages) of stuff or, if possible,
to a generic class. So, for instance, given the
expression el 7,4 por ciento in:
la rentabilidad sobre las yentas aumento
its profit over sales increased
del 6,3 al 7,4 por eiento.
from 6.3 to 7.4 per cent
it is sufficient to identify that the expression is
being used to refer to a percentage (of sales) in
order to assume the the expression is used to
refer to something new. Identifying a generic
reference on the basis of form is less obvious
but, in any case, this will resolve 4 to 6 of the
42 cases.
Second, for the 36 definite noun phrases used
to refer to a particular individual or stuff, the
basic procedure is to match the head noun
expression against each of the common noun
expressions that have been used previously. If
one is found, the complement expressions are
then matched. If these are compatible, the NP
under consideration is assumed to corefer to
the referent of the matching NP. This will
successfully resolve 27 of the 36 cases (75%)
but leaves 9 incorrectly resolved, 5 setting up
new referents when in fact they are coreferring
and 4 false positive cases of coreference.
The third step, then, is to inspect each
referent for semantic compatibility. Semantic
information is established on the basis of the
expression&apos;s form and context. For instance, in
looking for a possible referent for la
rentabilidad sabre las yentas (its profit over
sales ratio) above, it is first necessary to
establish that the potential referent must be
some measurement of financial performance
which has increased during some particular
period of time for some particular company.
At the time a reference for la rentabilidad
sobre las yentas is sought, there are some 98
existing referents (53 objects, 34 events, 11
implicit objects). The more recent of these
include &amp;quot;641.5 million Swiss Francs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Roche
Group&apos;s net profit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Roche Group&apos;s
pharmaceutical division&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;41% of Roche
Group&apos;s total sales&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;8.69 billion Swiss
Francs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Roche Group&apos;s total sales&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;198.8&amp;quot;
and so on. Of these, only &amp;quot;Roche Group&apos;s net
profit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Roche Group&apos;s total sales&amp;quot; are
possible measurements of a company&apos;s
financial performance. However, both these
measurements should be ontologically distinct
from a company&apos;s profit over sales as well as
from each other. Thus, they fail to satisfy the
semantic requirements of a potential referent
for the expression. In the end, no semantically
appropriate referent will be found among the
pool of existing referents and so a new referent
is introduced to the pool.
If an existing referent meets the
informational constraints on potential referent
of the expression being processed, the
expression is assumed to refer to that referent.
If no existing referent satisfies those
constraints, the expression is assumed to refer
to something new and a new referent is added
to the pool of referents.

4.2.4 Resolving Clauses
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999670380952381">
Noun phrases, of course, are not the only type
of constituent that is used to refer to things in
the world. Clauses may be used to refer (or
corefer) to particular events or states-of-affairs
or to classes of events or states-of-affairs.
These may be finite (main, relative,
complement or adverbial clauses), participials
(present or passive), infinitival or absolutive.
Of the 45 events referred to in the text, there
were 3 events that were referred to on more
than one occasion. The first, the purchasing of
Doctor Andreu, was coreferred to 4 times. But
of these, only one was by way of a (finite)
clause. The other three were all by way of NPs,
2 explicit and 1 imPliCit. The second, the
announcing of the purchase, was coreferred to
only once by way of a NP. The third, Roche&apos;s
investing in R&amp;D, was coreferred to once by
way of an implicit pro-verb introduced for
syntactic reasons in the context of a parallel,
conjoined structure.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995273">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999577">
The only form-based resolution procedure
for resolving clausal reference would be to
look for prior verbs having the same form and
then inspecting the complements for
contradictions. This procedure might be
extended by inspecting prior verb forms that
are related by, say, Spanish WordNet
(Rodriguez, 1998) or an on-line Spanish
thesaurus (if any should exist). However, this
extension could also open the door to many
false positives.
Such an approach might possibly resolve as
many as 26 of the 27 cases of clausal
references .to events or states of affairs
correctly. In any case, an IL-based approach
has the advantage of having the events
mentioned, in prior text already represented
formally and in a language neutral form. Thus,
the need for additional on-line resources for
each language is assuaged.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970039">
4.2.5 Resolving Implicit References
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974222222222">
As mentioned, there were 45 events or states-
of-affairs referred to in the sample Spanish text
which introduce an additional 30 implied
referents (5 times, 22 places and 3 actors).
These events, and the implicit referents they
introduce, need to be identified for successfully
carrying out the coreference task. They may
act as referents that are later referred to in the
text or they may serve to assist in constraining
or establishing coreference between later
expressions and other existing referents. For
instance, of the 22 implied locations, 6 are later
referred to in the text and, of the 5 implied
times, 3 are later referred to.
Clearly, there is no obvious form-based
resolution procedure for such elements, since
they have no explicit form. Thus, in order to
resolve these implicitly introduced referents,
the basic procedure is to treat them as
pronominals. That is, every event or state-of-
affairs in the TMR has an implicit &amp;quot;at that
time&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;at that place&amp;quot; associated with it
which has to be resolved as part of the
reference task. Beyond the fact that the
potential referents must times and locations
respectively, any further constraints will have
to be derived from what is known about the
event and about its relative (temporal or local)
status with respect to the other events which
have previously been mentioned. A primary
source of information for dealing with such
issues will be scripts (Schank &amp; Ableson,
1977). Similarly, the identification of implied
actors will be dependent on the ontological
(not lexical) definitions of the class of event or
state-of-affairs referred to and any additional
information that may be extracted from the
particular events or states-of-affairs that have
been previously mentioned.
Given the informational constraints gathered,
the procedure is then to inspect referents of
like type (time, location, actor type) in reverse
order of mention until one is found which is
compatible with those additional informational
constraints.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992219166666667">
The advantages of the interlingual approach to
reference resolution include the following:
• only expressions related to actual referents
are processed for coreference (i.e., no
pleonastic pronouns, no clitic pronouns, no
relative pronouns, etc.),
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982326954545455">
• implicit as well as explicit referents are
processes for coreference,
• knowledge-based inferencing (both
ontological and epistemic) is available for
resolving (many) problematical cases,
• ontologically connected actors, say, the
different participants in a sequence of
events making up a script, can be used to
establish coreference,
• texts in different languages can be
processed in the same way,
• all form-based procedures either are or can
be implemented in any case.
The central disadvantages are:
• some surface text level ordering
information is lost in the TMR,
• discourse-structural information may be
lost in the TMR, -
• the need for a large and sophisticated
knowledge sources,
• the need for sound and appropriately-
directed inferencing..
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99838725">
As a result of the loss of ordering information,
strict recency-based resolution procedures
cannot be implemented. The referents in the
domain are not ordered in terms of when they
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992856">

<bodyText confidence="0.999984086956522">
were introduced. The processing of the
different arguments in f-structure does not
necessarily correspond to the surface sequence
of their mention. This &amp;quot;defect&amp;quot; could possibly
be overcome by simply indexing each new the
TMR object with the prior index plus one
(assuming the indexes are integers). The tacit
assumption is that, at the level of the clause,
first the predicate is processed and then the
arguments are processed in left to right order
as they appear in f-structure.
As for the lack of information about the
discourse structure, it may be the case that this
is a defect of the TMR representation system.
That is to say, it is not unreasonable to assume
that the larger organisational aspects of a text,
the topics, their order of presentation, the
structure of the argumentation, etc., should in
fact be captured in any adequate representation
of the text. It has been, however, the goal of
TMR to focus on capturing the information
content exclusively and not on how the
information is presented.

We assume a two-stage language analysis system. First, a syntactic analysis of an input text results in a functional structure in which certain cases of pronominal reference are resolved. Second, the f-structure is mapped onto an representation. As part of this mapping, the reference of the various f-structure elements is resolved resulting in the addition of information to certain existing IL objects (coreference) or in the creation of new IL objects which are added to the domain of discourse (initial reference). For this effort, we adopt Text Meaning Representation for our IL and rely on the ONTOS ontology (Mahesh &amp; Nirenburg, 1995) as a general knowledge base. Since the central barrier to developing such a system today is the incompleteness of the knowledge base, we outline a strategy starting with the implementation of a series of form-based algorithms that applied directly to the referring expressions of the input text. These are initially supplemented by a knowledge-based resolution procedure which, as the knowledge base grows and the adequacy of the f-structure and IL-representation increases, takes on more and more of the processing load.</abstract>

This strategy is usually constrained by various syntactic heuristics such as that a non-reflexive pronoun in object position cannot corefer to the subject or a pronominal complement of a noun cannot corefer to the head (e.g., Ferrandez et al, 1998). Such a resolution procedure will account for 4 of the 6 cases (66%) in the sample text. To resolve the remaining cases, it is necessary to check the referent of the antecedent to see whether it is semantically compatible with the contextual function of the anaphor. So, for instance, in resolving the reference of su (its, his, her or their) in: El beneficio neto -el mejor de su The[---its] net profits the best in its historia- se elevii a 641,5 millones de history increased to 641.5 million francos Francs ... the procedure is to first shuffle back through the referring expressions until a thi</context>

First, a syntactic analysis of an input text results in a functional structure in which certain cases of pronominal reference are resolved. Second, the f-structure is mapped onto an interlingual representation. As part of this mapping, the reference of the various f-structure elements is resolved resulting in the addition of information to certain existing IL objects (coreference) or in the creation of new IL objects which are added to the domain of discourse (initial reference). For this effort, we adopt Text Meaning Representation for our IL and rely on the ONTOS ontology (Mahesh &amp; Nirenburg, 1995) as a general knowledge base. Since the central barrier to developing such a system today is the incompleteness of the knowledge base, we outline a strategy starting with the implementation of a series of form-based resolution algorithms that are applied directly to the referring expressions of the input text. These are initially supplemented by a knowledge-based resolution procedure which, as the knowledge base grows and the adequacy of the f-structure and IL-representation increases, takes on more and more of the processing load.
