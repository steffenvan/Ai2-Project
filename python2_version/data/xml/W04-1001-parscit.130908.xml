Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99961775">
The understanding and summarization of stories
remains a challenge, in part because of the
inability to adequately capture the ‘aboutness’ of
information content. This can result in
inappropriate content selection as well as summary
incoherence. This talk sketches a general
framework for narrative summarization that relies
in part on exploitation of temporal information. I
will show how this framework can help address
the above problems. I go on to discuss how
different levels of narrative structure can provide
useful information for summarization.
