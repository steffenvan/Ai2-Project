1. THE NATURE OF COMMUNICATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962">
Communication is often conceived of in basically the
following terms. A person has some idea which he or
she wants to communicate to a second person. The
first person translates that idea into some symbol
system which is transmitted through some medium to
the receiver. The receiver receives the transmission
and translates it into some internal idea. Communica-
tion, in this view, is considered good to the extent that
there is an isomorphism between the idea in the head
of the sender before sending the message and the
idea in the receiver&apos;s head after recieving the mes-
sage. A good medium of communication, in this view,
is one that adds minimal noise to the signal. Mes-
sages are considered good partly to the extent that
they are unabmiguous. This is, by and large, the view
of many of the people concerned with computers and
communication.
For a moment, consider a quite different view of com-
munication. In this view, communication is basically a
design-interpretation process. One person has goals
that they believe can be aided by communicating. The
person therefore designs a message which is intended
to facillitate those goals. In most cases, the goal in-
cludes changing some cognitive structure in one or
more other people&apos;s minds. Each receiver of a mes-
sage however has his or her own goals in mind and a
model of the world (including a model of the sender)
and interprets the received message in light of that
other world information and relative to the perceived
goals of the sender. This view has been articulated
further elsewhere !ij.
This view originates primarily from putting the rules of
language and the basic nature of human beings in
perspective. The basic nature of human beings is that
we are living organisms and our behavior is goals-
directed. The rules of language are convenient but
secondary. We can language rules for a purpose
break.
Communicating in different media produces different
behaviors and reactions 12 , The interesting first
order finding however, is that people can communicate
using practically any medium that lets any signal
through if motivation is high enough. We can, under
some circumstances, communicate with people who
use different accents, grammars, or even languages.
Yet, in other circumstances, people who are ostensibly
friends working on a common goal and who have
known each other for years end up shouting at each
other: &apos;You&apos;re not listening to me. No, you don&apos;t un-
derstand!&apos;
One fundamental aspect of human communication then
is that it is terrifically adaptive, and robust,containing
a number of sophisticated mechanisms such as expla-
nations that simultaneously facillitate social and work
goals &apos;14 imetacomments that direct the conversation[51,
and rules for taking turns..s,
To the extent that these mechanisms can be embed-
ded in a computer system that is to dialogue with hu-
mans, the dialogue will likely tend to be more suc-
cessful. However, equally true of human communica-
tion is that it is sometimes quite ineffective. Let us
examine where, why, and how the computer can help
improve communication in those cases.

2. FUNDAMENTAL DIFFICULTIES IN
COMMUNICATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905954545455">
The view of communication as a design-interpretation
process suggests that since messages are designed
and interpretted to achieve goals, the perceived rela-
tionship between the goals of the communicators is
likely to be a powerful determinant of what happens in
communication.. Common observation as well experi-
mental resultsillare consistent with this notion. Peo-
ple often view themselves in situations of pure compe-
tition or pure cooperation. In fact, I suggest that ei-
ther perception is due to a limited frame. Any two
people who view themselves as involved in a zero-sum
game are doing so because they have a limited frame
of reference. In the widest possible frame of refer-
ence, there is at least one state probabilistically influ-
enced by their acts (such as the total destruction of
human life through nuclear weapons) that both would
find undesirable. Therefore, when I am playing tennis,
poker, or politics with someone and we say we are in
pure competition, we are only doing so in a limited
framework. In a wider framework, it is always in our
mutual interest to cooperate under certain circum-
stances.
This does not mean, however, that people perceive
this wider framework. Because of the limitations of
human working memory, people often forget that there
is a framework in which they can cooperate. Indeed,
this describes one of the chief situations in which a
so-called breakdown of communications occurs. If we
are !May in a zero-sum game, communication is only
useful to the extent that we mislead, threaten, etc.
Conversely, people are only in pure cooperation by
limiting their framework. I suggest that it is highly
likely, given any two individuals, that they would put a
different preference ordering on the set of all possible
states of the world which their actions could probabil-
istically affect. This gives rise to a second type of
breakdown in communication. People appear to be
desiring to cooperate but they are only cooperating
with respect to some limited framework X. They are
competing with respect to some larger framework X
plus Y. The most common X plus Y is X, the frame-
work of cooperation plus Y, a consideration of whose
habits must change for mutually beneficial action in
the framework X.

For instance, two tennis partners obviously both want
to win the game. Yet one is used to playing with both
partners attempting to take the net. The other is used
to the &apos;one-up, one-back strategy. They can get into
a real argument. What they are competing about is
basically who is going to change, whose opinion is
wrong, and similar issues. This then, in a sense, is a
second type of breakdown of communication.
A third case exists even within the framework of coop-
eration. This case of difficult communication exists
when the presupposed conceptual frameworks of the
communicators is vitally discrepant. A computer pro-
grammer really wants to help a business person auto-
mate his or her invoicing application and the business
person really wants this to happen. However, each
party erroneously presumes more shared knowledge
and viewpoint than in fact exists.
A puzzle still remains however. If people have such
sophisticated, graceful, robust communication mecha-
nisms, why do they not quite readily and spontaneous-
ly overcome these communication blocks?

WIDESPREAD ANTI-PRODUCTIVE BELIEFS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991146206185567">
The biggest stumbling blocks to effective communica-
tion are the individual communicator&apos;s beliefs. People
typtcaily hold beliefs which are not empirically based. To
some extent, it is impossible not to. In order to sim-
plify the world sufficiently to deal with it, we make
generalizations. If it turns out on closer inspection
that these genralizations are correct, we call it insight
while if it turns out that they are incorrect, we call it
overgeneralization.
There are, however, a number of specific non-
empirically based beliefs that people are particularly
likely to believe which are anti-productive to commu-
nication. Among these are the following: 1. I must be
understood; 2. If the other person disagrees with me,
they don&apos;t understand me; 3. My worth is equal to my
performance; 4. Things should be easy; 5. The world
must be fair; 6. If I have the feeling of knowing some-
thing is true, it must be true; 7. If the other person
thinks my idea is wrong, the person thinks little of me;
8. If this person&apos;s idea is wrong, the person is worth-
less; 9. I don&apos;t need to change -- they do; 10. Since I
already know I&apos;m right, it is a waste of time to really
try to see things from the other person&apos;s perspective.
11. If I comprehend something, in the sense that I can
rephrase it in a syntactically different way, that means
I have processed deeply enough what the other person
is saving. 12. I must tell the truth at all times no mat-
ter what. 13. If they cannot put it in the form of an
equation (or computer program, or complete sen-
tences, or English), they don&apos;t really know what they
are talking about and so it is not possibly in my inter-
est to listen.
Each of the above statements, has a correlated, less
rigid, less extreme statement that is empirically based.
For instance, if we really thought &apos;When I am wrong,
some people will temporarily value me less&apos;, that is a
valid generalization. In contrast, the thought &apos;When I
am wrong, people will value me less&apos; is an overgener-
alization.
Similarly, it is quite reasonable to believe that ex-
pressing something mathematically has advantages
and that if it is not expressed mathematically it may
be more difficult for me to use the ideas; it may even
be so difficult that I choose not to bother. It is not
empirically based to believe that it is never worth you
while to attempt to understand things not expressed in
equations.
Nearly everyone, even quite psychotic people hold
rational as well as irrational beliefs. Very few people
when asked whether they have to be perfect in every-
thing will say yes. However, very many people reject
so completely evidence that they may be fundamental-
ly wrong, that they act as though they must be per-
fect. It is bitter irony that most people can think and
feel much more clearly about the things that are less
important to them such as a crossword puzzle than
they can about things that are much more important
such as their major decisions in work and love.
Now let us imagine someone who has done a certain
office procedure a certain way for many years. Then
someone begins to explain a new procedure that is
claimed to work better. There are a number of wholly
rational reasons why the experienced office worker
can be skeptical. But it is probably quite worthwhile
to at least attempt to really understand the other
person&apos;s ideas before criticizing them. There are
many non-empirically based beliefs that may interfer
in the communication process. The experienced office
worker may, for instance, notice the young age of the
systems analyst and believe that no-one so young
could really understand what is going on. They may
believe that if there is a better way, they should have
seen it themselves years ago and if they didn&apos;t they
must be an idiot. Since they didn&apos;t see it and they
can&apos;t be an idiot, there must not be a better way.
They may just think to themselves it will be too hard
to learn a new way. Very effective individual therapy
P is based on trying to identify and change an
individual&apos;s irrational beliefs. The focus of this paper
however is on how a computer system could aid com-
munication by overcoming or circumventing such irra-
tional beliefs in those cases where communication
appears to break down.
We know that people are capable of changing from a
narrow competition framework to a wider cooperative
framework in order to communicate. People can re-
solve differences about whose behavior needs to
change. Normal communication has the mechanisms to
do these things; when they fail to happen it is often
because of irrational beliefs which prevent people
from attempting to see things from the other person&apos;s
perspective.
The 1.4nnis partner&apos;s disagreeing about what strategy
to use will tend to resolve the disagreement without
detriment to their mutual goal of winning the game,
provided their thinking stays fairly close to the empiri-
cal level. If, however, one of the participants finds a
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999964733333334">
flaw in the other&apos;s thinking and then overgeneralizes
and thinks &apos;What an idiot. That doesn&apos;t logically fol-
low. How can anyone be so dumb.&apos; But by the token
&apos;dumb&apos;, the angry person probably means &apos;all-around
bad.&apos; Now this is an extrememly counter-productive
overgeneralization which will tend to color the
person&apos;s thinking on other issues of the game which
are not even within the scope of the argument about
what strategy to use. In extremely irrational but not
so uncommon cases, the person may even express to
the other person verbally or non-verbally that they
have a generally low opinion of their partner. If either
party becomes angry, they are also likely to mix up
their messages about their own internal state with
messages about the content of the game. Thus, &apos;I am
angry, gets mixed with &apos;A serve to that person&apos;s
backhand will probably produce a weaker return.&apos; The
result may be a statement like &apos;Why can&apos;t you serve to
his backhand for a change.&apos; Such a statement is likely
to increase the probability of serves to the forehand
or double faults to the backhand.
Once each person becomes angry with the other, they
are almost certainly overgeneralizing to the extent that
they are believing that the only way to improve the
situation is for the other person to change their be-
havior in some way &apos;He should apologize to me for
being such an idiot.&apos; No active problem solving behav-
ior remains directed where it belongs: &apos;How can I im-
prove the situation myself? How can I communicate
better?&apos; This is communication breakdown.

4. THE POSSIBLE USES OF AN ACTIVE COMMU-
NICATION CHANNEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981380952382">
Now, let&apos;s just for the sake of arguement, assume or if
you like pretend that what I have said so far is a useful
perspective. What about the computer? In particular,
what about using the power of the computer as a non-
transparent ACTIVE medium of communication? The
computer has been very successfully used as a way
for people to communicate which allows
speed/repetition and demands precision. Is there also
a way for the computer to be used to enhance party-
to-party communication in a way that helps defeat or
get around the self-defeating beliefs that get in the
way of effective communication in situations where
participants have similar goals but are working in dif-
ferent frameworks? Can the computer aid in situations
where participants have partially similar goals but are
concentrating on the differences...or are unable to
arrive at conclusions that are in both parties self-
interest because of interferrence from a set of sepa-
rate issues where they are in fundamental conflict?
An entire technology equal to the one that has ad-
dressed the speed/repetion precision issues could be
built around this task. Clearly I cannot provide this
technology myself in fifteen minutes or fifteen years.
But let me provide one example of the kind of thing I
mean. Suppose that one two people were disagreeing
and communicating via Visual Display Terminals con-
nected to a computer network. Let us suppose that
the computer network imposed a formalism on the
communication. Suppose, for example that strength
and directionality of current emotional state were en-
coded on a spatially separate channel from content
messages. Imagine that the designer of the message
had to choose what emotion or emotions they felt and
attempt to honestly quantify these. This information
would be presented to the other person separately
from the content statements. One unfortunate human
weakness would be overcome; viz., the tendency to let
the emotional statement -- &apos;I am angry&apos; intrude into
the content of what is said.
Now, suppose the computer network presented to the
interpretter of this message a set of signals labelled
as follows: &apos;The person sending this message to you is
currently producing the following emotional states in
themselves: Anger +7, Anxiety +4, Hurt +3, Depres-
sion +2, Gladness -6.&apos; Note that the attribution has
also been shifted squarely to where it belongs -- on
the person with the emotional state.
Now suppose further that when a person stated their
position, certain key words triggered a request by the
system for restatement. For instance, suppose a per-
son typed in &apos;You always get what you want.&apos; The sys-
tem may respond with: &apos;Regarding the word &apos;always&apos;,
could you be more quantitative. First, in how many
instances during the last two weeks would you esti-
mate that there have been occassions when that per-
son would like to have gotten something but could not
get that thing?&apos;
Unfortunately, asked just such a question, an angry
person would probably become angrier and direct
some anger toward the active channel itself. A mar-
riage counselor is often caught in just this sort of
bind, but can usually avoid escalating anger via empa-
thy and other natural mechanisms. How a computer-
ized system could avoid increasing anger remains a
challenge.
Another possibility would be for the channel to enforce
the protocol for conflict resolution suggested by Rap-
paport and others. For instance, before stating your
position, you would have to restate your opponent&apos;s
position to their satisfaction.
Needless to say, participants using such an active
interface would be apprized of the fact and voluntarily
choose to use such an interface for their anticipated
mutual benefit in the same way that labor and man-
agement often agree to use a mediator or arbitrator to
help them reach an equitable solution. Unfortunately,
such a choice requires that both the people involved
recognize that they are not perfect -- that their com-
munication ability could use an active channel. This in
itself presupposes some dismissal of the erroneous
belief that their worth EQUALS their performance.
Most people are capable of doing this before they
become emotionally upset and hence might well agree
ahead of time to using such a channel.

solve such communication problems by the parties
themselves can largely be traced to the high frequency
of strongly held anti-empirical belief systems. Finally,
it is suggested that the computer is a medium for hu-
mans to communicate with each other VIA. Viewed in
this way, possibilities exist for the computer to be-
come an active and selective rather than a passive, transparent
medium. This could aid humans in overcoming or
circumventing communication blocking irrational be-
liefs in order to facillitate cooperative problem solving.

They are competing with respect to some larger framework X plus Y. The most common X plus Y is X, the framework of cooperation plus Y, a consideration of whose habits must change for mutually beneficial action in the framework X. 83 For instance, two tennis partners obviously both want to win the game. Yet one is used to playing with both partners attempting to take the net. The other is used to the &apos;one-up, one-back strategy. They can get into a real argument. What they are competing about is basically who is going to change, whose opinion is wrong, and similar issues. This then, in a sense, is a second type of breakdown of communication.

If this person&apos;s idea is wrong, the person is worthless; 9. I don&apos;t need to change -they do; 10. Since I already know I&apos;m right, it is a waste of time to really try to see things from the other person&apos;s perspective. 11. If I comprehend something, in the sense that I can rephrase it in a syntactically different way, that means I have processed deeply enough what the other person is saving. 12.

But it is probably quite worthwhile to at least attempt to really understand the other person&apos;s ideas before criticizing them.

The focus of this paper however is on how a computer system could aid communication by overcoming or circumventing such irrational beliefs in those cases where communication appears to break down. We know that people are capable of changing from a narrow competition framework to a wider cooperative framework in order to communicate. People can resolve differences about whose behavior needs to change. Normal communication has the mechanisms to do these things; when they fail to happen it is often because of irrational beliefs which prevent people from attempting to see things from the other person&apos;s perspective.

If, however, one of the participants finds a 84 flaw in the other&apos;s thinking and then overgeneralizes and thinks &apos;What an idiot. That doesn&apos;t logically follow. How can anyone be so dumb.&apos; But by the token &apos;dumb&apos;, the angry person probably means &apos;all-around bad.&apos; Now this is an extrememly counter-productive overgeneralization which will tend to color the person&apos;s thinking on other issues of the game which are not even within the scope of the argument about what strategy to use. In extremely irrational but not so uncommon cases, the person may even express to the other person verbally or non-verbally that they have a generally low opinion of their partner. If either party becomes angry, they are also likely to mix up their messages about their own internal state with messages about the content of the game. Thus, &apos;I am angry, gets mixed with &apos;A serve to that person&apos;s backhand will probably produce a weaker return.&apos; The result may be a statement like &apos;Why can&apos;t you serve to his backhand for a change.&apos; Such a statement is likely to increase the probability of serves to the forehand or double faults to the backhand. Once each person becomes angry with the other, they are almost certainly overgeneralizing to the extent that they are believing that the only way to improve the situation is for the other person to change their behavior in some way &apos;He should apologize to me for being such an idiot.&apos; No active problem solving behavremains directed where it belongs: &apos;How improve the situation myself? How can I communicate better?&apos; This is communication breakdown. THE OF AN ACTIVE COMMU- NICATION CHANNEL let&apos;s just for the sake of arguement, if like what I have said so far is a useful perspective. What about the computer? In particular, what about using the power of the computer as a nontransparent ACTIVE medium of communication? The computer has been very successfully used as a way for people to communicate which allows speed/repetition and demands precision. Is there also a way for the computer to be used to enhance partyto-party communication in a way that helps defeat or get around the self-defeating beliefs that get in the way of effective communication in situations where participants have similar goals but are working in different frameworks? Can the computer aid in situations where participants have partially similar goals but are concentrating on the differences...or are unable to arrive at conclusions that are in both parties selfinterest because of interferrence from a set of separate issues where they are in fundamental conflict? An entire technology equal to the one that has addressed the speed/repetion precision issues could be built around this task. Clearly I cannot provide this technology myself in fifteen minutes or fifteen years. let me provide one example of the thing I mean. Suppose that one two people were disagreeing and communicating via Visual Display Terminals connected to a computer network. Let us suppose that the computer network imposed a formalism on the communication. Suppose, for example that strength and directionality of current emotional state were encoded on a spatially separate channel from content messages. Imagine that the designer of the message had to choose what emotion or emotions they felt and attempt to honestly quantify these. This information would be presented to the other person separately from the content statements. One unfortunate human weakness would be overcome; viz., the tendency to let the emotional statement -- &apos;I am angry&apos; intrude into the content of what is said. Now, suppose the computer network presented to the interpretter of this message a set of signals labelled as follows: &apos;The person sending this message to you is currently producing the following emotional states in themselves: Anger +7, Anxiety +4, Hurt +3, Depression +2, Gladness -6.&apos; Note that the attribution has also been shifted squarely to where it belongs -on the person with the emotional state. Now suppose further that when a person stated their position, certain key words triggered a request by the system for restatement. For instance, suppose a person typed in &apos;You always get what you want.&apos; The system may respond with: &apos;Regarding the word &apos;always&apos;, could you be more quantitative. First, in how many instances during the last two weeks would you estimate that there have been occassions when that person would like to have gotten something but could not get that thing?&apos; Unfortunately, asked just such a question, an angry person would probably become angrier and direct some anger toward the active channel itself. A marriage counselor is often caught in just this sort of bind, but can usually avoid escalating anger via empathy and other natural mechanisms. How a computerized system could avoid increasing anger remains a challenge. Another possibility would be for the channel to enforce the protocol for conflict resolution suggested by Rappaport and others. For instance, before stating your position, you would have to restate your opponent&apos;s position to their satisfaction. Needless to say, participants using such an active interface would be apprized of the fact and voluntarily choose to use such an interface for their anticipated mutual benefit in the same way that labor and management often agree to use a mediator or arbitrator to help them reach an equitable solution. Unfortunately, such a choice requires that both the people involved recognize that they are not perfect -that their communication ability could use an active channel. This in itself presupposes some dismissal of the erroneous belief that their worth EQUALS their performance. Most people are capable of doing this before they become emotionally upset and hence might well agree ahead of time to using such a channel. 5. SUMMARY In this paper, I reiterate the view that for many purposes, communication is best conceived of as a 85 design-interpretation process rather than a senderreceiver process. Fundamental difficulties in twoperson communication occur in certain common situations. The incidence, exacerbation, and failure to solve such communication problems by the parties themselves can largely be traced to the high frequency of strongly held anti-empirical belief systems. Finally, it is suggested that the computer is a medium for humans to communicate with each other VIA. Viewed in this way, possibilities exist for the computer to bean than a transparent medium. This could aid humans in overcoming or circumventing communication blocking irrational beliefs in order to facillitate cooperative problem solving.</abstract>
