This paper presents a project that
investigates to what extent computational
linguistic methods and tools used at GETA
for machine translation can be used to
implement novel functionalities in
intelligent computer assisted language
learning. Our intelligent tutoring system
project is still in its early phases. The
learner module is based on an empirical
study of French as used by Acadian
elementary students living in New-
Brunswick, Canada. Additionally, we are
studying the state of the art of systems using
Artificial Intelligence techniques as well as
NLP resources and/or methodologies for
teaching language, especially for bilingual
and minority groups.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986756756757">
The project that we have started is intended for
the minority French speaking Acadian
community living in Atlantic Canada. In many
families, parents used to go to English schools
and sometimes cannot adequately help their
children in their school work. Children, who
now go to French schools, often switch back to
English for their leisure activities because of the
scarcity of options open to them. Many of these
children use English syntax as well as borrowed
vocabulary quite frequently. In brief, this
setting of language learning is not that of a
typical native speaker.
We begin our presentation with a literature
review of related work in Intelligent Tutoring
Systems (ITS) particularly on Computer
Assisted Language Learning (CALL and
Intelligent CALL) followed by the principles
that this community is now expecting from
system builders. In the following sections we
summarize an empirical study that helped us
define the learner model. Then, in the last
section we propose the system&apos;s general
architecture and an overview some of its
activities; particularly those that counteract
Anglicisms by double generating examples in
standard French and in the local dialect using
linguistic resources usually used in machine
translation.
To our knowledge, there are no systems that use
machine translation tools for generating two
versions of the same language instead of
multilingual generation. Another novelty is in
the pedagogical approach of exposing the
learner to the expert model and to the learner
model in a comparative manner, thus helping to
clarify the sources of error.

<bodyText confidence="0.999959523809524">
Among the first milestones in Intelligent
Tutoring Systems (ITS) was Carbonell&apos;s system
(1970) that used a knowledge-base to check the
student&apos;s answers and to allow him/her to interact
in &amp;quot;natural language&amp;quot;. BUGGY, by Brown and
Burton (1978) is another system more oriented
towards student error diagnostic. At around the
same period researchers were starting to put also
some emphasis on the teaching strategies
adopted in the system such as in WEST, Burton
&amp; Brown (1976).
It&apos;s with such works and many others later, that
Intelligent Tutoring Systems&apos; architecture was
more or less separated into four modules: an
expert&apos;s model, a learner&apos;s model, a teacher&apos;s
model, and an interface, Wengers (1987).
However, language learning had its own specific
difficulties that were not generalized in other
ITS systems. How to represent the linguistic
knowledge in the expert and learner models?
How to implement parsers that can process

ungrammatical input? How to implement
teaching strategies that are appropriate for
language learning? These are some of the issues
of high interest, Chanier, Renie &amp; Fouquere
(1993).
Recent systems show how researchers are being
more open to psycho linguistic, pedagogical and
applied linguistic theories. For example, The
ICICLE Project is based on L2 learning theory
(McCoy et al., 1996); Alexia (Selva et al., 1997)
and FLUENT (Hamburger and Hashim, 1992)
are based on constructivism, Mr. Collins (Bull et
al., 1995) is based on four empirical studies in
an effort to &amp;quot;discover&amp;quot; student errors and their
learning strategies.
Another tendency, that is very noticeably
parallel to that of NLP, is the development of
sophisticated language resources such as
dictionaries for language (lexical) learning as
exemplified by CELINE at Grenoble (Menezo
et al., 1996), the SAFRAN project (1997) and
The Reader at Princeton University (1997)
which uses WordNet , or real corpuses as in the
European project Camille (Ingraham et al.,
1994).
The literature review lead us to believe in the
following basic principles:
Pl. Language is learned in context through
communication and experience, Chanier
(1994).
P2. Language is learned in the natural order
from receptive to productive.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996456166666667">
P3. Grammatical forms ought to be taught
through language patterns.
P4. Vocabulary learning means learning the
words and their limitations, probability of
occurrences, and syntactic behavior around
them, Swartz &amp; Yazdani (1992).

<bodyText confidence="0.999905571428571">
In an effort to gain some insight into the
projected linguistic model, an empirical study
on the population of elementary students in the
City of Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada was
completedl. The study consisted of one-on-one
interviews where the children were presented
with images having very few possible

interpretations. The only question that was asked
was &amp;quot;Qu&apos;est-ce que c&apos;est?&amp;quot; (What is this?).
In the next sections, we will examine the
children&apos;s answers concerning relative clauses.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999284">
2.1 Subject Relative Clauses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9850112">
When the children were asked about the main
subject in the picture, the answers were
acceptable in standard French, showing that they
had no problems in using relative clauses with
qui. Following are some examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9604253">
1. C&apos;est une chienne qui boit;
2. C&apos;est un chien qui boit du lait;
Some of the answers showed other elements
concerning lexical use:
3. C&apos;est un garcon qui kick la balle.
(Use of an English verb)
4. C&apos;est une fille qui botte le ballon.
(Use of an inappropriate verb)
5. C&apos;est un papa et son garcon.
(Bypassing strategy)
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999598">
2.2 Object Relative Clauses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944833333333">
In this part of the experiment, the object of the
picture was the center of the questions.
Following are some of the answers with the most
frequent errors or bypassing strategies, they are
marked with a *; the sentences with italics are
the acceptable ones:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993707">
6. C&apos;est le livre que le garcon lit.
*7. C&apos;est le livre qui se fait lire par la fine.
*8. C&apos;est le livre a la fille.
*9. C&apos;est le livre qu&apos;elle lit dedans.
*10. C&apos;est un livre, la fille lit le livre.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975636363637">
The errors seen in these examples constitute
around fifty percent of the answers given by
first grade children and are reduced to around
thirty percent in sixth grade. Answers 7 and 10
are examples of bypassing strategies i.e.; the use
of a different verb or another sentence structure
as a means for avoiding relative clauses.
Answer 8 shows a common use of the
preposition a instead of de. Answer 9 is also
representative of the frequent use of
prepositions at the end of the sentence.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999761">
2.3 Complex Relative Clauses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9520585">
The following examples give a brief survey of
the use of indirect object relative clauses: avec
lequel / laquelle, sur lequel / laquelle, a qui,
and dont:

2.4 Error Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999915">
By looking at these examples, it is evident that
complex relative clauses are rather unknown to
the children. They show that the easiest particles
for them are qui and que even when misused as
in answer 12.
It can also be concluded that they use que in a
non standard manner every time they need to
use complex relative clauses. Otherwise they use
a bypassing strategy by separating the sentence
into two parts as in &amp;quot;C&apos;est une branche et un
oiseau&amp;quot;, or by using another verb that allows qui
as in 18.

3 General System Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999438133333334">
The system we are building has a mixed
initiative, multi-agent architecture. Mixed
initiative because we want the system to serve
both the teacher and the student, in both
teaching and in learning modes. For example,
the teacher could favor certain activities such as
presenting examples of &amp;quot;non standard French
sentences&amp;quot; and opposing them to English
structures in a effort to show the children some
Anglicisms; or maybe choose a specific micro-
world, such as Holloween or Christmas so that
the exercises would be closer to children&apos;s real
daily experience (principle P1).
The syntactic graph and the lexicon are
annotated with probabilities on usually faulty
expressions in order to intensify the explanation
or the number of examples and exercises on
those particular parts (principles P3 and P4).
We do not intend to build a fully free learning
environment. The environment is partially
structured. The user chooses where to start by
clicking on a hot-button picture. He/she chooses
the micro-domain and the wanted activities.
However, unexpected &amp;quot;pop-up&amp;quot; activities would
come up on the screen from time to time (style&amp;quot;
Tip of the day&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;TV ad.&amp;quot;).
As this system is being built for young children,
not every single word is expected to be typed on
the keyboard. Following are some examples of
the look and feel of our system:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996083545454545">
1. Children can pick activities from graphical
images on the screen.
2. Corpuses or extracts from children stories are
equipped with hyperlinks to word meanings or
grammar usage explanations.
3. Puzzle playing where words have assigned
shapes according to their functions. Fitting the
puzzle means placing the words in the correct
order.
4. Picking words they like and asking the system
to make up a sentence;

<bodyText confidence="0.931309">
All the above possibilities are optional. This
allows the teacher to take responsibility of the
degree of unstructured or of focused learning.

4 GETA&apos;s Used Resources
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.89879475">
For many years GETA has been working on MT
systems from and into French. An impressive
core of linguistic knowledge is available but has
not yet been experimented on in building
language learning software, though work is
underway for integration of heterogeneous NLP
components, Boitet &amp; Seligman (1994). Ariane
for example, uses special purpose rule-writing
formalisms for each of its morphological and
lexical modules both for analysis and for
generation, with a strict separation of
algorithmic and linguistic knowledge, Hutchins
&amp; Somers (1992).
The following modules from GETA were used
in our experiment2 :
A. Morphological agent.
-ATEF for the morphological analysis sub-
agent.
-SYGMOR for the morphological
generation sub-agent.
B. Lexical agent.
-EXPANSF for lexical expansion
-TRANSF for translation into standard
French
C. ROBRA in its multi-level analysis
-for syntactic tree definitions and
manipulations
- for logico-semantic functions

The first series of experiments we realized using

study (see section 2).

These two graphs show how straight forward was
the use of language resources for highlighting
similarities and/or differences in these two
dialects. Tha same grammar can be used by
incrementing its rules to include new/different
sentence structures. The lexicon can be
augmented similarly.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990421052632">
We have presented in this paper an ongoing
software development project that is still in its
early phases. In the introduction and in the first
sections, we have argued for the positive effects
of computers on language learning and then on
some of the issues that researchers in the field
are hoping to see implemented from a
computational and a pedagogical point of view.
We have also seen, through an empirical study,
the kinds of linguistic difficulties that a minority
group is encountering. In such a case one
cannot help but to think about the advantages
that technology can offer, especially in an era
where Language resources are ready for the
pick. We have opted to use the highly
formalized and parameterized resources at
GETA in an effort to develop a quickly
functional prototype that we can immediately
submit for on-the ground testing.
