Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99988315">
Aptness is an umbrella term that covers a
multitude of issues in the interpretation and
generation of creative metaphor. In this paper
we concentrate on one of these issues — the
notion of lexical systematicity — and explore
its role in ascertaining the coherence of creative
metaphor relative to the structure of the target
concept being described. We argue that all else
being equal, the most apt metaphors are those
that resonate most with the way the target
concept is literally and metaphorically
organized. As such, the lexicon plays a key role
in enforcing and recognizing aptness, insofar as
this existing organization will already have
been lexicalized. We perform our exploration in
the context of WordNet, and describe how
relational structures can be automatically
extracted from this lexical taxonomy to
facilitate the interpretation of creative
metaphors.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999816500000001">
When one considers the aptness of creative
metaphor and how one might measure it, one finds
a whole range of issues lurking between the
apparent unity of this umbrella term. This
complexity is compounded by the fact that
metaphors operate at several different levels of
representation simultaneously: the conceptual
level, or the level of ideas; the lexical level, or the
level of words; and the pragmatic level, or the
level of intentions. A metaphor may fall at any of
these hurdles, either through a poor choice of a
source concept, a poor choice of words in
communicating this concept, or in a failure to
observe the expectations of the context in which
the metaphor is expressed.
Some degree of aptness is afforded by
metaphors that compare semantic neighbors,
inasmuch as the existence of a common taxonomic
parent suggests that the source and target are in the
same, or at least similar, domains (e.g., see Way,
1991). For instance, metaphors that compare
politicians to architects, or even geneticists to
cartographers, derive some measure of aptness
from the fact that in each case the source and target
are sub-categories of the Profession category.
However, since the most creative of metaphors are
those that make the greatest semantic leaps
between the source and target concepts, such
category-hopping metaphors do not have the
luxury of comparing concepts that are already
deemed similar in taxonomic terms, as evidenced
by a common superordinate concept, but must
instead establish a new basis for conveying
similarity that is not itself taxonomic. Consider for
instance a corollary of the above metaphor in
which “ genomes are maps” . The aptness of these
similarity-creating metaphors is instead a measure
of the isomorphism between the relational
structures of the source and target, so that the
concepts with the greatest structural overlap will
often produce the most apt metaphors. In this
respect, metaphoric aptness is a function of what
Gentner terms the systematicity of a structure-
mapping. According to (Gentner, 1983) and the
structure-mapping school of thought (e.g., see also
Veale and Keane, 1997), the best interpretations of
a metaphor or analogy are those that systematically
pair-off the greatest amount of connected relational
structure in each concept. We refer to this kind of
structural aptness as internal systematicity, since
any sense of aptness arises out of a coherence
between the internal structures of the concepts
being mapped.
Lakoff and Johnson (1980) also place a strong
emphasis on metaphoric systematicity, but in their
hands the notion is construed in more external
terms. To L&amp;J, systematicity is a measure of the
generativity of a metaphoric schema, so that the
same schema (such as Life is a Journey) can serve
as the deep structure for a wide variety of different,
but mutually systematic, surface metaphors (such
as “ my job has hit a rocky patch” and “ my career
has stalled” ). In this view, systematicity is a
measure of how much a metaphor resonates and
coheres with existing metaphors for thinking about
the target concept, so that when viewed
collectively, they together suggest the operation of
a common underlying schema. This view of
systematicity is external to the concepts involved
since it predicates their aptness to each other on
the existence of other structures (metaphor
schemas) into which they can be coherently
connected.
In this paper we argue that the lexicon is central
to the determination of both kinds of systematicity,
internal and external, especially if one is an
adherent of the generative lexicon view of word
meaning as championed by (Pustejovsky, 1991). In
such a lexicon we can expect to find precisely the
kind of relational structure needed to perform
structure mapping and thereby measure the internal
systematicity of a metaphor like “ a passport is a
travel diary”. In addition, we can expect to find the
lexicalized metaphor structures that represent the
surface manifestations of existing modes of
thought, and it is against these structures that the
external systematicity of an interpretation can be
measured.
This research is conducted in the context of
WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998), a
comprehensive lexical knowledge-base of English.
The structure of WordNet makes explicit some of
the relationships needed to construct a generative
lexicon, most obviously the formal (taxonomic)
and constitutive (meronymic) aspects of word
meaning. But to truly test a model of metaphoric
interpretation on a large-scale, it is necessary to
augment these relationships with the telic and
agentive components that are not encoded directly
but merely alluded to in the textual glosses
associated with each sense entry. In the sections to
follow we describe a mechanism for automating
the extraction of these relationships (in the same
vein as (Harabagiu et al. 1999), and for using them
to generative apt interpretations for metaphors
involving WordNet entries.

2 Qualia Extraction from Glosses
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997585281690141">
In a generative lexicon, the core elements of word
meaning are represented by a nexus of relations
called a qualia structure, which ties together the
formal (i.e., hierarchical relations), constitutive
(i.e., meronymic), telic (i.e., functional) and
agentive (i.e., construction/creation) aspects of a
word. For instance, a diary is formally a kind of
?book’ that constitutes a ?collection of personal
writings’ whose telic purpose is to ?record’ the
observations of the agent that ?compiles’ it. When
a word like “ diary” is used metaphorically, this
relational nexus provides the structure for
determining the internal systematicity of any
interpretation. For instance, it is apt to describe a
passport as a kind of travel diary since both are
kinds of book (formal) that record (telic) travel
experiences.
We describe here an approach to qualia
extraction from WordNet glosses that balances
coverage with quality: by attempting to extract a
relatively narrow slice of the relational structure
inherent in WordNet glosses, we can be confident of
quite high levels of competence. Nevertheless, even
this narrow slice yields a significant amount of
qualia structure, since WordNet already encodes
formal and constitutive relations in its taxonomic
and meronymic links between synsets. We thus
concentrate our efforts on the extraction of telic
(i.e., goal-oriented) and agentive (activity-oriented)
lexical relations.
We exploit the fact that the agentive and telic
aspects of lexico-conceptual structure are often
expressed using nominalized verbs that implicitly
encode relational structure. A small number of
highly productive morphology rules1 can thus be
used to connect “observe” to “observer” and
“observation” (and vice versa), “specialize”, to
“specializer” and “specialization”, and so on. For
example, the WordNet concepts {botanist} and
{philologist} are both defined with glosses that
explicitly employ the term “specializing”, thus
evoking the concept {specializer} (a hyponym of
{expert}) Now, because {specializer} is compatible
with the concepts {botanist} and {philologist} by
virtue of being a hyponym of {person}, this in turn
suggests that {botanist} and {philologist} should
be seen as hyponyms of {specializer}, making
specializer_of is an appropriate telic relation for
each. Thus, using a combination of derivational
morphology and simple taxonomic reasoning, the
relational structure specializer_of:specialization
can be associated with each concept. Since this
structure is not already encoded in WordNet, it
provides an additional dimension of similarity in
any metaphoric mapping.
Broad clues as to the syntactic form of the gloss
(such as the use of the passive voice) are also a
valuable source of extraction information,
especially when they can be robustly inferred from
a simple combination of keyword analysis and
inflectional morphology. For example, the passive
voice should cause an extracted relation to be
inverted, as in the case of {dupe}, whose WordNet
gloss is “a person who is swindled or tricked”.
The resulting relational structure is thus:
1 The developers of WordNet have recently announced that
hand-coded morpho-semantic links will be added to future
versions of WordNet, to make explicit the relationship
between verbs and their nominal forms, thus obviating the
need for such rules while making the extraction task even
more reliable.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.723429">
{dupe} —&gt; of_swindler:swindler n of_trickster:trickster
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.972294924242424">
Note that the extraction process is too shallow
to do very much with the disjunctive “ or” present
in the gloss of {dupe}, as this is more a process of
information extraction than full natural-language
parsing. Thus, it simply conjoins any relationship
that can be reliably extracted with morphological
cues into an overall relational structure. This
structure is simply a bag of relations at present,
which we choose to present here as connected via
conjunction. Future versions of the extraction
process may attempt to impose a more elaborate
inter-connecting structure on the relationships that
are extracted, but for the present, an unstructured
bag is sufficient to support a consideration of
metaphor in WordNet.
Since morphology alone is not a sufficiently
reliable guide for extraction purposes, the approach
crucially requires the WordNet taxonomy to act as
a vital sanity-check for any extracted relationship.
In general, it is sensible to associate a relation r
with a concept c if the nominalization of r denotes a
concept that belongs to the same taxonomic
category as c; thus, it is sensible to ascribe a
specializer_of relation to {botanist} only because
{specializer} and {botanist} each specify a sub-
category of {person}. However, this broad
injunction finds an important exception in
metonymic contexts. Consider the WordNet gloss
for {diary, journal}, “a daily record of (usually
private) experiences and observations”, which
yields the extracted relationships of_diarist:diarist,
of_experience: experience, recorder_of:recording
and observer_of:observation. A taxonomic sanity-
check reveals that {diary, journal}, as a sub-
category of {communication}, is not compatible
with either {recorder} or {observer}, both sub-
categories of {person}. However, it is
taxonomically compatible with the objects of these
relations, {recording} and {observation}, which
suggests that a diary is both the object of, and a
metonym for, the diarist as observer and recorder.
This metonymy is most evident in the familiar
address “dear diary”, in which the diary is
conceived as a personified counterpart of the
observer. The concept {diary, journal} therefore
yields the modified relational structure:
{diary, journal}  *observer_of:observation
 *recorder_of:recording
 of_experience:experience
The (*) here signals that the observer_of and
recorder_of relations hold metonymically rather
than literally. The presence of these relationships
facilitate creative uses of the concept {diary} that
follow the general pattern whereby artifacts are
viewed from an intentional stance. For example,
consider that the WordNet gloss for the concept
{witness, spectator} is “a close observer”, so that
the following relational structure is extracted:
{witness, spectator}  observer_of:observation
It now becomes apt to metaphorically consider a
diary to be a witness to one’s life experiences. In
structure-mapping terms, this aptness is reflected in
the internal systematicity of finding a key
relationship, observer_of:observation, common to
each of the concepts {diary} and {witness,
spectator}.

3 Internal Systematicity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999735379310345">
Because purely taxonomic interpretations are
created on the basis of commonalities, they tend to
be highly symmetric, as in the case of similes such
as “ credit unions are like banks” and “ gamblers are
like alcoholics” . In contrast, the most creative
metaphors are asymmetric (Ortony, 1991), since
they impose the highly-developed relational
structure of the source concept onto that of the
less-developed target (see Lakoff and Johnson,
1980; Gentner, 1983; Veale and Keane, 1997).
Without this imposition of relational structure,
metaphor can be used only to highlight existing
similarities rather than to actually create new ones,
and is thus robbed of its creative function.
The projection of relational structure can be
performed either literally or figuratively. In a literal
interpretation, the relational structure of the source
is simply instantiated with the target concept, so for
example, a literal “travel diary” is a diary that
contains travel recordings and travel observations.
In contrast, figurative interpretations first attempt
to find a target domain correspondence for the
source concept, and then project the relational
structure of the source onto this counterpart
(Gentner, 1983). For instance, WordNet contains a
variety of concepts that are formally similar to
{diary, journal} and which also mention “travel” in
their glosses, such as {travel_guidebook} and
{passport}.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8130935">
“travel”+ {diary, journal} 
{passport} + *observer_of:travel:observation
 *recorder_of:travel:recording
 of_experience:travel:experience
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999836777777778">
Projecting the relational structure of {diary,
journal} onto {passport} causes the latter to be
seen as a journal of travel observations and
experiences, and indeed, many travelers retain old
passports for this very purpose.
Metaphors are most apt when projection
highlights a latent relational structure that already
exists in the target concept (Ortony, 1979). For
example, the compound “pastry surgeon” can be
understood taxonomically as referring to
{pastry_cook}, since like {surgeon} it is a sub-
category of {person}. But to fully appreciate why
{surgeon} is more apt than other hyponyms of
{person}, like {astrologer} say, one must look to
the shared relational structure that is highlighted by
the metaphor. WordNet 1.6 defines a surgeon as a
“physician who specializes in surgery”, while a
pastry cook is glossed as “a chef who specializes in
pastry”. Both {surgeon} and {pastry_cook} thus
become associated with the relationship
specializer_of:specialism. This common relational
structure facilitates the measurement of what we
have termed ‘internal systematicity’ (in the Gentner
sense). Thus, {surgeon} is seen as an apt vehicle for
{pastry_cook} as both are people that specialize in
a particular field. Instantiation of the shared
structure leads to the following interpretation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9883285">
“pastry” + {surgeon} 
{pastry_cook} + specializer_of: pastry:surgery
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949787234043">
One can reasonably argue that much more
sophisticated interpretations are available to
human readers of this metaphor, e.g., that pastry
cooking and surgery are both delicate operations
involving special training, both are performed with
specialized instruments in very clean surroundings,
etc. But given the inherent limitations of working
with an existing semi-structured knowledge source
such as WordNet, as opposed to a dedicated, hand-
crafted knowledge-base, “ pastry specialist” must
suffice as a generalization for these richer
interpretations. Alternately, one might argue that it
is “ pastry” rather than “ surgeon” that undergoes
metaphoric reinterpretation, so that the phrase
denotes a literal surgeon that operates on
metaphoric pastries, such as movie starlets or
supermodels. In this current work we choose to
focus on the relational potential for the head word
to metaphorically denote a relationally similar, if
sometimes semantically distant, referent, while
acknowledging that this illuminates just one part
of the picture.
Nonetheless, interpretations like “ pastry
specialist” can be given more credibility if one
delves deeper into its metaphoric ramifications to
consider the recursive sub-metaphors that it
implies. For instance, as stated in the analysis
above, “ pastry surgeon” implies the plausibility of
a meaningful interpretation for “ pastry surgery”.
This choice to delve deeper, and recursively
determine an appropriate interpretation of “ pastry
surgery”, is left to the comprehender, who may
instead choose to read the metaphor as a simple
request to view pastry chefs as specialists. But this
raises the question of how much structure must be
shared for an interpretation to appear apt rather
than merely inept. For example, one can equally
well say “ pastry linguist” or “ pastry geologist” to
highlight the specialist nature of pastry chefs, since
{geologist} and {linguist} are also associated with
an extracted specializer_of relationship. What
makes these alternate metaphors seem clumsy is
the difficulty in assigning appropriate
interpretations to the recursive metaphors that they
imply: “ pastry geologist” implies the metaphor
“ pastry geology” , while “ pastry linguist” implies
the metaphor “ pastry linguistics” .
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.835392">
(?) “pastry” + {linguist} _&gt;
{pastry_cook} +
specializer_of:pastry:linguistics
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.981818194444444">
There is little that can be done to put a sensible
interpretation on “pastry linguistics” in WordNet,
given the taxonomic and relational structure of
{pastry) and {linguistics). In contrast, “pastry
surgery” has more potential for meaningful
interpretation using WordNet structures. There
exists a sense of surgery that denotes a discipline in
the natural sciences, and from {pastry) a broad
search will find the concept {dietetics), another
discipline of the natural sciences dedicated to food
preparation. This analogue of {surgery) can be
found by first considering all concepts associated
with “pastry”, then all concepts associated with
“baked goods”, then “foodstuff” and “food”, until
an appropriately similar candidate is found.
{dietetics} = the scientific study of food
preparation and intake
This is not a particularly well-known concept, so it
would be difficult to argue that this forms the
cornerstone of an easily understood metaphor like
“pastry surgeon”. However, the concept {dietetics)
does at least concretize, in WordNet terms, the idea
that one can take a precise, scientific view of food
preparation, and it is the plausibility of this notion
that allows us to make sense of pastry preparation
as a surgical activity. There is no true substitute for
situated experience of the world, but when it comes
to metaphor interpretation using lexical resources
like WordNet, we should be willing to use any
lexical precedent we can find.
As an alternate strategy, we can seek to recruit a
sub-category of surgery that can be modified in
some way to accommodate the concept {pastry).
One such category is {plastic_surgery), whose
gloss reveals a concern with the reformation of
body tissue.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6657624">
{plastic_surgery} = surgery concerned with
therapeutic or cosmetic
reformation of tissue
� “pastry” + {surgery} —&gt;
{plastic_surgery} + reformation_of: pastry:tissue
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999693052631579">
This interpretation requires that an existing form of
surgery is recruited and adapted so as to
accommodate the concept {pastry}. In taxonomic
terms, {plastic_surgery} is perhaps most
appropriately adapted for this purpose, since
{tissue} and {pastry} are both hyponyms of
{substance} in WordNet. Of course, the intended
sense of “ tissue” in the above gloss is not {tissue,
tissue_paper} but {tissue} as a hyponym of
{body_part}. However, creative metaphors often
involve a degree of domain incongruence, whereby
a given word has a different meaning in the source
and target domains (Ortony, 1979). In fact, one
might say that domain incongruence is essential to
creative metaphor, since interpretation will
necessitate the grafting of structure from radically
distant parts of the concept ontology, and such
grafts may fail if the features involved maintain
their strict, source-dependent definitions.

4 External Systematicity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956076923077">
Metaphors appear more apt when they
systematically evoke, or connect into, established
modes of metaphoric thought. This is systematicity
considered from an external vantage as described
by (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). For example,
when processing the metaphor “ political
mechanic” , several concepts can be reached from
“ political” that prove to be taxonomically
compatible with {mechanic}, among them
{political_leader}, {political_scientist} and
{machine_politician}. However, closer inspection
of the projected structure suggests that the last,
{machine_politician}, is the most systematic:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.991645333333333">
“political” + {mechanic}
 {machine_politician}
+ machinist_of: political:machine
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999628083333333">
Because the extracted qualia structure for
{mechanic} hinges on the relationship
machinist_of:machine, there is a suggestive lexical
systematicity with the concept
{machine_politician}. Furthermore, the
instantiated structure creates a fortuitous pairing
political:machine, which already exists in
WordNet as the lexicalized metaphor
{political_machine}. This marks “ political
mechanic” as a systematic outgrowth of the
established metaphor schema Political System As
Machine (whose corollary is Political Operatives
as Fixers). The same schema comes into play
when interpreting the metaphor “ political
draftsman” , whose WordNet gloss also evokes
images of machinery.
Lexicalized metaphors like {political_machine},
{political_science} and {political_campaign} act
as the recognizable landmarks in the search space
of possible interpretations for novel metaphors. So
if an interpretation can be generated that connects
into an established metaphor, it has a greater
provenance than one that stands alone. Here are
some further examples:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.970411272727273">
{torchbearer}  a leader in a campaign or movement
 “political” + {torchbearer} 
{political_leader} + campaigner_of:political:campaign
{missionary}  someone who attempts to convert
others to a [...J program
 “political” + {missionary} 
{political_commissar} + programmer_of: political:program
{sociologist}  a social scientist who studies
[...J human society
 “political” + {sociologist} 
{political_scientist} + scientist_of: political:science
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.956339636363636">
These examples are fortuitous in the sense that the
instantiation of qualia structure directly suggests an
existing WordNet concept. In most cases, however,
the external systematicity becomes visible only
upon recursive consideration of the instantiated
structure as a source of metaphor in itself. Consider
the metaphor “genetic cartographer”, for which
{geneticist} is retrieved as a thematically similar
concept:
{cartographer}  a person who makes maps
{geneticist}  a person who specializes in genetics
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.7175605">
 “genetic” + {cartographer} 
{geneticist} + mapper_of: genetic:mapping
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997371333333333">
There is no denotation for “ genetic mapping” in
WordNet, so at first blush the above interpretation
fails to connect into an existing lexicalized
metaphor. However, when we recursively consider
the combination “ genetic mapping” as a metaphor
in itself, we obtain the following interpretation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.893449">
“genetic” + {mapping} � {chromosome_mapping}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.989164130434783">
� the process of locating genes
on a chromosome
This allows us to recognize “genetic mapping” as
an alternate way of denoting the concept
(chromosome_mapping), while the fact that a
mapping metaphor has already been lexicalized in
the genetics domain allows us to recognize the
external systematicity inherent in the interpretation
of “geneticist as cartographer”. This WordNet entry
serves to ground the sub-metaphor of genetic
mapping in an existing concept, allowing the
recursive analysis of sub-metaphors to halt at this
point. A “genetic cartographer” is thus a geneticist
that performs a specialized kind of map-making
called chromosome mapping, where the terrain that
is mapped is biological and information-theoretic
rather than geological or geographic. Though
chromosome mapping is itself a metaphor, its
independent existence in WordNet means that it
does not need to be justified in the context of an
interpretation of “genetic cartographer”, and for the
purposes of analysis can be treated as a literal
stopping-point.

5 The Challenge of Aptness
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965476739130435">
I suspect we can all agree that aptness involves a
complex interaction of different issues that arise
from lexical and conceptual choice. The real
question is the degree to which each of these issues
influences a particular interpretation, and the
weighting, if any, that is to be given to each
component of aptness in an algorithmic model.
Take the metaphor “political surgeon”: by
considering the concepts in the semantic
neighborhood of (surgeon) reachable via the
thematic cue “political”, we find the following
competing interpretations:
{political_scientist} = a social scientist specialising in the
study of government
{spin_doctor} � a spokesperson for a political party
or candidate who tries to
forestall negative publicity
The first of these interpretations,
{political_scientist), is apt for reasons of internal
systematicity, as both it and {surgeon) have an
extracted qualia structure that contains a
specializer_of:specialization relationship. This
leads to the following interpretation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.84251">
“political” + {surgeon}
—&gt; {political_scientist}
+ specialiser_of:political:specialisation
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997062962963">
The second interpretation, {spin_doctor), does not
exhibit the same internal systematicity, but it does
exhibit an external systematicity of sorts: the head
of this compound term, “ doctor” , denotes a
concept {doctor, physician) that is a hypernym of
the metaphoric vehicle, {surgeon).
It would seem a matter of personal choice as to
which interpretation should be privileged here, as
different listeners may attach more weight to the
presence of internal systematicity in
{political_scientist) than to the suggestion of
external systematicity in {spin_doctor), and vice
versa. This suggests that the problem of aptness
determination involves a great deal of hidden
parameters yet to be made explicit in any model of
interpretation. As researchers interested in
computational treatments of metaphor, our goal
then should be to explicate what factors we can in
algorithmic and representational terms, to provide
the basic inventory of components needed to
proceed with our investigation into this elusive and
considerably vexing phenomenon. In this paper we
have argued that the natural place to compile this
inventory is the lexicon, since this acts as the
bridge between word and world knowledge and
aptness is a phenomenon that hops freely between
both.

<abstract confidence="0.997858714285714">Aptness is an umbrella term that covers a multitude of issues in the interpretation and generation of creative metaphor. In this paper we concentrate on one of these issues — the notion of lexical systematicity — and explore its role in ascertaining the coherence of creative metaphor relative to the structure of the target concept being described. We argue that all else being equal, the most apt metaphors are those that resonate most with the way the target concept is literally and metaphorically organized. As such, the lexicon plays a key role in enforcing and recognizing aptness, insofar as this existing organization will already have been lexicalized. We perform our exploration in the context of WordNet, and describe how relational structures can be automatically extracted from this lexical taxonomy to facilitate the interpretation of creative metaphors.</abstract>

In this respect, metaphoric aptness is a function of what Gentner terms the systematicity of a structuremapping. According to (Gentner, 1983) and the structure-mapping school of thought (e.g., see also Veale and Keane, 1997), the best interpretations of a metaphor or analogy are those that systematically pair-off the greatest amount of connected relational structure in each concept. We refer to this kind of structural aptness as internal systematicity, since any sense of aptness arises out of a coherence between the internal structures of the concepts being mapped. Lakoff and Johnson (1980) also place a strong emphasis on metaphoric systematicity, but in their hands the notion is construed in more external terms. To L&amp;J, systematicity is a measure of the generativity of a metaphoric schema, so that the same schema (such as Life is a Journey) can serve as the deep structure for a wide variety of different, but mutually systematic, surface metaphors (such as “ my job has hit a rocky patch” and “ my career has stalled” ). In this view, systematicity is a measure of how much a metaphor resonates and coheres with existing metaphors for thinking about the target concept, so that when </context>

In contrast, the most creative metaphors are asymmetric (Ortony, 1991), since they impose the highly-developed relational structure of the source concept onto that of the less-developed target (see Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Gentner, 1983; Veale and Keane, 1997). Without this imposition of relational structure, metaphor can be used only to highlight existing similarities rather than to actually create new ones, and is thus robbed of its creative function. The projection of relational structure can be performed either literally or figuratively. In a literal interpretation, the relational structure of the source is simply instantiated with the target concept, so for example, a literal “travel diary” is a diary that contains travel recordings and travel observations. In contrast, figurative interpretations first at</context>

In fact, one might say that domain incongruence is essential to creative metaphor, since interpretation will necessitate the grafting of structure from radically distant parts of the concept ontology, and such grafts may fail if the features involved maintain their strict, source-dependent definitions. 4 External Systematicity Metaphors appear more apt when they systematically evoke, or connect into, established modes of metaphoric thought. This is systematicity considered from an external vantage as described by (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). For example, when processing the metaphor “ political mechanic” , several concepts can be reached from “ political” that prove to be taxonomically compatible with {mechanic}, among them {political_leader}, {political_scientist} and {machine_politician}. However, closer inspection of the projected structure suggests that the last, {machine_politician}, is the most systematic: “political” + {mechanic}  {machine_politician} + machinist_of: political:machine Because the extracted qualia structure for {mechanic} hinges on the relationship machinist_of:machine, there is a suggestive lexical syste</context>

A metaphor may fall at any of these hurdles, either through a poor choice of a source concept, a poor choice of words in communicating this concept, or in a failure to observe the expectations of the context in which the metaphor is expressed. Some degree of aptness is afforded by metaphors that compare semantic neighbors, inasmuch as the existence of a common taxonomic parent suggests that the source and target are in the same, or at least similar, domains (e.g., see Way, 1991). For instance, metaphors that compare politicians to architects, or even geneticists to cartographers, derive some measure of aptness from the fact that in each case the source and target are sub-categories of the Profession category. However, since the most creative of metaphors are those that make the greatest semantic leaps between the source and target concepts, such category-hopping metaphors do not have the luxury of comparing concepts that are already deemed similar in taxonomic terms, as evidenced by a common superordinate concept, but must instead establish a new basis for conveying </context>

This view of systematicity is external to the concepts involved since it predicates their aptness to each other on the existence of other structures (metaphor schemas) into which they can be coherently connected. In this paper we argue that the lexicon is central to the determination of both kinds of systematicity, internal and external, especially if one is an adherent of the generative lexicon view of word meaning as championed by (Pustejovsky, 1991).

Metaphors are most apt when projection highlights a latent relational structure that already exists in the target concept (Ortony, 1979). For example, the compound “pastry surgeon” can be understood taxonomically as referring to {pastry_cook}, since like {surgeon} it is a subcategory of {person}. But to fully appreciate why {surgeon} is more apt than other hyponyms of {person}, like {astrologer} say, one must look to the shared relational structure that is highlighted by the metaphor. WordNet 1.6 defines a surgeon as a “physician who specializes in surgery”, while a pastry cook is glossed as “a chef who specializes in pastry”. Both {surgeon} and {pastry_cook} thus become associated with the relationship specializer_of:speciali</context>

In taxonomic terms, {plastic_surgery} is perhaps most appropriately adapted for this purpose, since {tissue} and {pastry} are both hyponyms of {substance} in WordNet. Of course, the intended sense of “ tissue” in the above gloss is not {tissue, tissue_paper} but {tissue} as a hyponym of {body_part}. However, creative metaphors often involve a degree of domain incongruence, whereby a given word has a different meaning in the source and target domains (Ortony, 1979). In fact, one might say that domain incongruence is essential to creative metaphor, since interpretation will necessitate the grafting of structure from radically distant parts of the concept ontology, and such grafts may fail if the features involved maintain their strict, source-dependent definitions. 4 External Systematicity Metaphors appear more apt when they systematically evoke, or connect into, established modes of metaphoric thought.
