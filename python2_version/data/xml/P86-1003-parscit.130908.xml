Tense, temporal adverbs, and temporal connectives
provide information about when events described in
English sentences occur. To extract this temporal
information from a sentence, it must be parsed into a
semantic representation which captures the meaning of
tense, temporal adverbs, and temporal connectives.
Representations were developed for the basic tenses, some
temporal adverbs, as well as some of the temporal
connectives. Five criteria were suggested for judging these
representations, and based on these criteria the
representations were judged.

English sentences contain many types of temporal
information. Tense is used to inform the reader (listener)
of when the event associated with the main verb occurs
with repect to the time of utterance. That is, tense informs
the reader that an event occurs before, after, or during the
time of utterance. Temporal adverbs (such as tomorrow or
now) add additional information about the events in a
sentence. Temporal connectives tell the reader about the
temporal relationship between the events in the main clause
and the events in the subordinate clause. While there is
other temporal information that can be found in sentences,
the following will concentrate on these three.
To extract temporal information from a sentence, it must
be parsed into a semantic representation which captures the
meaning of tense, temporal adverbs, and temporal
connectives. A temporal representation of tense, adverbs,
and temporal connectives must:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.948185076923077">
1. provide a way to reject temporally incorrect
sentences, such as * &amp;quot;I will run yesterday.&amp;quot;
2. allow one to reason about the temporal relationship
between events. For instance, the sentence &amp;quot;I had
run when he arrived&amp;quot; implies that the run event
occurs before the arrival, whereas in the sentence
&amp;quot;I was running when he arrived,&amp;quot; the arrival and
run events overlap.
3. allow the exact time of event to be unfixed until it is
pinpointed based on contextual information or adverbial
modification.
4. allow reference to points and intervals of time (eg.
precisely at 3 PM VS. for 5 hours).

to be simple and compositional.
These criteria were used to judge previous temporal
representation research (Bruce (1972), Hornstein (1977,
1981), Yip (1985)). None fulfilled all five criteria. The
criteria will also be used to judge the representations
developed here.

The representations for tense, adverbs, and temporal
connectives developed here is based on McDermott&apos;s
(1982) temporal logic. McDermott&apos;s &amp;quot;point-based&amp;quot;
temporal logic was chosen because it is not unusual to talk
about the beginning and end points of a period of time or
an event. In fact, the semantics of tense developed here
relate the endpoints of events in sentences. This
representation of tense provides a flexibility not found in
many other representations of tense (eg. (Hornstein,
1977,1981)). Flexibility is important since events can
extend over tense boundaries (for instance, &amp;quot;In 3 minutes,
the boy will have run for 24 hours.&amp;quot;). Any representation
of events in time must capture the fact that some events do
not always wholly occur in the past, present, or future with
respect to the time of utterance.
The tense rules are compositional and require the
following relations : &lt; (before), &gt; (after), =
(cotemporaneous), 5 (before or cotemporaneous), and
(after or cotemporaneous). It is assumed that events are
&amp;quot;unit&amp;quot; events and have a beginning and an end point,
where the beginning of an event is before or simultaneous
to its end point. The endpoint of an event need not imply
the achievement of the purpose with which the event was
initiated (eg. the existence of the end point of a winning
event need not imply that the state of having won is
achieved). To capture the meaning of simple as well as
more complex tenses, we introduce the following events:

1. Utterance Event - This is simply the speaking event
associated with a sentence.
2 Main Event - This is the event indicated by the main
verb of the sentence. For instance, the run event in the
following sentence is the main event: &amp;quot;I have been
running to the store.&amp;quot;
3. Perfect Event - This is the time interval referred. to

in sentences like : &amp;quot;Bill had eaten at 3 PM,&amp;quot; which
describes an eat event in the &amp;quot;distant past.&amp;quot; This
sentence implies the existence of an event or time
interval which occurs after the main event (eat) but
before the utterance event.

or the minimal possible duration of a main event with
certain phenomena in our model of temporal adverbs
which the main event extends into the past and into the
future. The progressive event may have no correlation
with a &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; event, but its existence predicts
and connectives. It can be thought of as a place holder,
progressive aspect.
The following five rules describe the semantics of tense
both in English and in our representation. The verbs in a
sentence are parsed left to right (assuming an ATN, which
is the parser in which these tense rules were implemented).
One of the following three rules is triggered by the tense of
the first verb in the sentence. &amp;quot;Event&amp;quot; (in the first three
rules) can be a main event, a perfect event, or a
progressive event depending on the sentence.

<listItem confidence="0.993949">
1. Past rule : This rule implies that there exists some
event that must end before the beginning of the
utterance event.
(&lt; (end event) (begin utterance-event))
2. Present rule: This rule implies that there exists some
event that is either cotemporaneous with the utterance
event or can begin at or after the beginning of the
utterance event. Which is asserted seems to depend on
the aspect of the verb associated with event.

These rules combine in a compositional way to define
the more complicated tenses. For instance the past perfect
progressive tense combines the past rule with the perfect
and progressive rules. Thus the sentence &amp;quot;Jack had been
running&amp;quot; is represented as follows:
(and (inst utterance6 utterance-event)
(&lt; (end have2) (begin utterance6)) ; past rule
(inst have2 perfect-event)
(&lt;= (end be3) (begin have2)) ; perfect rule
(inst be3 progressive-event)
(inst run64 run)
(&lt;= (begin run64) (begin be3)) ; progressive rule
(&gt;= (end run64) (end be3))
(inst run64 main-event)
(name Jack16 Jack)
(:= &apos;(agent run64) Jack16))

A parser uses the semantic rules of tense as follows.
After checking the tense of the first verb, the parser checks
to see if the verb is the word will. If it is, then move to the
next verb and mark the event associated with this verb as a
future event Assert either the past, present or future rule
depending on the tense associated with the &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; of the
current verb. Now check to see if the current verb is have
followed by a past participle. If so, then assert the perfect
rule relating the perfect event (the event associated with
have) and the event associated with the verb to the right of
have, and move to that verb. After checking for perfect
tense, the parser looks for a form of the word be followed
by the progressive form of a verb. This signals the
progressive rule, which relates the progressive event with
the main event
The representation adopted has some support in
linguistic literature, and there are some similarities to the
representations developed by Bruce (1972), Hornstein
(1977, 1981), Reichenbach (1947), and Yip (1985),
although there are many differences. One difference
between this representation and previous representations of
tense is how present tense is defined. All past theorists
have considered present tense as indicating that the main
event is cotemporaneous with the time of utterance.
However, aspect of verb seems to affect the meaning of
present tense. In present tense sentences, there exists a
curious phenomenon which can best be understood by
examining the following two sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992509">
1. I leave at eight o&apos;clock tomorrow.
2. .1 have a dog tomorrow.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.896428">
Aspect interacts with present tense requiring a more
complicated present rule in a theory of tense.

Adverbials
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999792">
The representation of several types of temporal adverbs
will be considered, as well as how the meaning of these
adverbs combines with the meaning of the tense. As in the
representation of tense, we require the following relations:
&lt;, &gt;, and =. We will consider how to predict
incorrect combinations of tense and adverbs based on the
representations of tense and adverbs developed here.
As suggested by Hornstein (1977), we adopt the idea
that which event is modified by an adverbial is an
important issue (since we introduce multiple events in our
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989791">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.993152032258064">
definition of some of the basic tenses). The ambiguity
concerning which event is modified can best be seen in the
following example: &amp;quot;I had eaten at 3.&amp;quot; This sentence has a
utterance event, which can not be directly modified by an
adverb. It can be modified by context, and it can be
modified when some event which is cotemporaneous to the
utterance event is modified. The past perfect sentence
introduces a perfect event and a main event (eat) in addition
to the utterance event. If we assume that the main event is
modified, then the time of &amp;quot;eating&amp;quot; must overlap 3 o&apos;clock.
If it modfies the perfect event, then by the time 3 o&apos;clock
came around the &amp;quot;eating&amp;quot; was complete. In general, we
adopt the idea that which event is modified is ambiguous,
and thus a disjunction of possibilities is asserted.
Since Hornstein (1977) and Yip (1985) examined the
three adverbials tomorrow, yesterday, and now, we will
concentrate on these three. Each of these adverbs shares
the fact that they are defined with respect to the time of the
utterance event (today is also included in this category of
adverbs though not discussed here). The representations
of now, tomorrow, and yesterday follow:
Now : Now is defined to be a time interval which is
cotemporaneous with the utterance event. Thus, the
representation of some specific now is:
(and (inst now 16 time-interval)
(= (begin now16) (begin utterance2))
(= (end now16) (end utterance2)))
Tomorrow: Tomorrow is also defined with respect to
the time of utterance. Notice that the duration of tomorrow
is precisely 24 hours (as indicated in the fourth conjunct).
(and (inst tomorrow3 day)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8878086">
(&gt; (begin tomorow3) (end utterance2))

(+ (end utterance2)(* 24 hour)))

(* 24 hour)))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.802738">
Yesterday: Yesterday is defined with respect to the time
of utterance, and has a 24 hour duration.

<bodyText confidence="0.999493204545455">
To satisfy criterion 1, this model should be able to
predict temporal inconsistencies between temporal adverbs
and tense. Any event in a sentence can be modified by an
adverb if the event can potentially overlap the period of
time associated with the adverb. Thus we introduce the
overlap rule of adverb-tense agreement:
Overlap Rule: An event can be modified by a temporal
adverb iff the time period associated with an adverb can
overlap the time period associated with the event without
some temporal contradiction. That is, if the following
assertion does not contradict other temporal assertions
associated with the sentence, then the events can overlap:
(and (5 (begin event) (end adverb))
(&amp;quot;a (end event) (begin adverb)))
Because events are defined flexibly in this tense
representation, some events can cross tense boundaries.
For correct adverb-tense agreement, the events in the
sentence must be &amp;quot;anchored&amp;quot; to the event associated with
the first verb in the sentence, that is the event that
determines the tense of the sentence (note that will has no
event associated with it). The need for this anchoring can
best be shown with following examples:
*Now, he will have eaten. (excluding modal reading)
*yesterday, he will have eaten. (excluding modal reading)
Tomorrow, he will have eaten.
The tense stucture of each of these sentences (as given by
our tense rules) introduces three events, an utterance event,
a perfect event, and a main event. Notice that the only
event that is necessarily in the future is the perfect event.
The main event could overlap yesterday or now, as well
as tomorrow. Thus it would seem that given that the main
event can be modified by yesterday or now, the first two
sentences should be correct. However, except for
possible modal readings, these sentences are not
acceptable. We account for this with the following rule:
Anchoring rule : If the time period of the event
associated with the first verb of a sentence can overlap the
time period associated with an adverb, then the adverb can
modify that event and can potentially modify the other
events in the sentence (based on the overlap rule). The
utterance event can not be modified using the anchoring
rule.
To show how these two rules (anchoring and overlap)
are used, examine the sentence: &amp;quot;He is running now.&amp;quot;

run event can not overlap tomorrow (because the run event
ends in the past and tomorrow begins in the future), and
the sentence is therefore reported as erroneous. See Table
1 for the adverb-tense predictions of our model. Modal
readings are ignored in this paper.
There are other adverbials which are interpreted relative
to the time of utterance (for instance, this week, next
week, and last year). It is not difficult to imagine how to
represent these adverbials. There are also some adverbials
which need not be defined relative to the time of utterance.
These include all of the clock calendar adverbials, such as
Sunday and midnight. For example the representation of a
specific Sunday is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.949934666666667">
(and (inst sunday3 day)
(= (- (end sunday3) (begin sunday3))
(* 24 hour)))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981426">
Sunday3 can not be placed in the past, present, or future.
However, when Sunday is used in a sentence, we can
determine whether we mean a past, present, or future
Sunday. Durational adverbials can also be easily
represented (somewhat like the definition of Sunday).
There are other adverbials which like clock calendar
adverbials are not interpretted with respect to the time of
speech. One such temporal adverb is just. This adverb is
distinguished from the word just, meaning only. To see
how it is used, examine the following sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996758777777778">
1. I just ate lunch.
2. I was just eating lunch.
3. I had just eaten lunch.
4. * I just eat.
5. I am just eating lunch.
6. I have just eaten lunch.
7. * I will just eat lunch.
8. I will be just eating lunch.
9. I will have just eaten lunch.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990459666666667">
Notice that just can not be used in simple present or simple
future tense. This adverb requires the existence of some
event in the sentence that begins immediately after the start
of the event modified by just. Sentences 5 and 8 require
progressive events to represent their tense structure. This
tense representation allows our model to predict the
correctness of these two sentences. The definition of just
follows :
Just: Just relates two events, where Evl can be the main
event, the progressive-event, or the perfect-event, and Ev2
can be the utterance-event, the perfect-event, or the
progressive-event. Evl and Ev2 must not be separated by
another event introduced by the sentence. a is some small
value which is determined by context.
(&lt; (begin Evl) (begin Ev2))
if (5 (End Evl) (begin Ev2)) then
assert (5 (- (begin Ev2) (End Evl)) a)
else
assert (5 (- (begin Ev2) (begin Evl)) a)
There are many other temporal adverbials that need to
be represented, among them recently, afterwards, earlier,
lately, already, and soon. Most of these relate two events,
in much the same way as temporal connectives which will
be our next topic.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.967732">
Temporal Connectives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986877">
A few issues must be examined before we present our
representation of temporal connectives. First it should be
pointed out that temporal connectives are subordinators.
Most subordinators do not restrict the tense of the
subordinate clause given the tense of the main clause. The
tense of the main clause does restrict the tense of the
subordinate clause when the subordinator is a temporal
connective. The following results are predicted by
Hornstein (1977) :
John left when Harry
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999094">
1. *arrives. 4. arrived. 7. *will come.
2. *is arriving. 5. was arriving. 8. *will be coming.
3. *has arrived. 6. had come. 9. *will have arived.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994225">
By studying the above example, one might suggest that the
tense of the main clause and the tense of the subordinate
clause must have the same tense (disregarding progressive
and perfect aspects). This seems to be true for all past and
present tenses. There are some restrictions of this
statement, however, since the will/shall construction of
future tense is not allowed in temporal subordinate clauses.
As pointed out by Leech (1971) :
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.916082">
&amp;quot;In dependent clauses introduced by conditional and temporal
conjunctions if, unless, when, as soon as, as, etc., the future is
denoted by the ordinary Present Tense instead of the construction
with will/shall:
Ill tell you if it hurts.
When the spring comes, the swallows will return.
Jeeves will announce the guests as they arrive.&amp;quot; (p.59)
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.998685">
6
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949488888889">
If the will/shall construction is used in a subordinate
clause introduced by a temporal connective, then the
reading of the sentence is not a future but a modal reading.
This fact was not noticed by Hornstein (1977, 1981) or
Yip (1985). Hornstein allows both present tense and
will/shall future tense to occur in temporal subordinate
clauses. Yip only allows the will/shall future tense to
occur in the subordinate clause&apos;.
Rather than include the syntactic needs of temporal
connectives in our semantic representation, it seems wiser
to include the requirement at a syntactic level. That is the
tense of the first verb of the main clause restricts the tense
of the first verb in the temporal subordinate clause. If the
tense of the first verb in the main clause of the sentence is
past or present, then the tense of the first verb in the
subordinate clause must have like tense. If the tense of the
first verb in the main clause is future tense, then the tense
of the first verb in the subordinate clause must be present
tense (though it will be semantically interpretted as future
tense).
Now, we must consider how to extract the temporal
meaning of sentences of the form sentence-temporal
connective-sentence. Each clause will be given a temporal
representation as indicated in the tense representation
section of this paper. Both clauses will have the same time
of utterance, since an utterance event is created only for a
sentence. The only subtlety is the requirement that present
tense in a subordinate clause be interpretted using future
semantics when the main clause has future tense. After
each clause is represented, the semantics for the temporal
connective must be invoked. Each temporal connective
requires its own definition, as pointed out by
Hornstein(1977). These definitions will determine the
temporal relationship between the events in the main clause
and the events in the subordinate clause. We will present
the definitions for five temporal connectives : when, while,
until, before, and after. Because these definitions can use
the representation of tense associated with each clause in a
sentence to interrelate the events between clauses, the
strength of the tense representation is increased.
When : align the anchor events to determine the
relationship between events of the clauses. If the main
events of both clauses are the anchor events, then the
events may occur at exactly the same time, though not
necessarily.

<bodyText confidence="0.96030075">
While: align the anchor and main events of the clauses.
Check to see if the alignment of both is possible. If check
returns false then reject the sentence.
1. Yip(1985) and Hornstein(1977) try to deal with this
temporal connective phenomenon and adverb-tense
agreement with a unified theory. Hornstein&apos;s theory
accepts sentences of the form *&amp;quot;I have eaten tomorrow&amp;quot; so
that the sentence &amp;quot;I will leave when he has eaten&amp;quot; is
acceptable. Yip modifies Hornstein&apos;s theory to get rid of
the yesterday-present perfect error, but the modification
does not allow a future tense main clause to have a present
tense subordinate clause.

Until : requires in most cases that the main event of the

event of the subordinate clause ends.

Before : requires that the anchor event of the main clause
end before the beginning of the main event of the
subordinate clause.
(&lt; (end anchor-event(main-clause))
(begin main-event(subordinate-clause)))
After: requires in most cases that the main event of the
main clause begin after the end of the anchor event of the
subordinate clause. If the main clause has a progressive
event, then the anchor event of the main clause begins after
the end of the anchor event of the subordinate clause and
the main event of the subordinate clause ends before the
end of the main event of the main clause.
If main clause has a progressive event then
(and (&lt; (end anchor-event(subordinate-clause))

(end main-event (main-clause))))

Notice that before and after are not always inverses of one
another. Consider the following two sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.966052">
1. I ate before he was running
2. He was running after I ate.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999801">
If before and after were inverses, then sentence 1 and 2
would have equivalent meanings which they do not. The
definitions of before and after capture this assymetry.
Two Examples are presented to acquaint the reader
with the representation of sentences joined by temporal
connectives. The first is : &amp;quot;Mary ate when Joe was eating.&amp;quot;

sentence, and was exactly the interpretation that

that the when rule predicts very different relationships

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999301956521739">
This paper describes a preliminary study of the temporal
phenomena found in English sentences. Many issues have
been ignored for simplicity. For instance, the issue of
habitual readings of verbs was not examined. The
meanings of verbs with temporal aspects (such as plan)
were also not considered. In addition, we did not consider
how to relate (in time) events from different sentences.
The only events from different sentences that can be related
are the utterance events. If two sentences occur in
sequence, one can conclude only that the utterance event of
the first ends before the utterance event of the second.
The model developed here can, however, temporally
order events within a sentence. Five criteria were
suggested at the beginning of the paper for the
representation of temporal information found in an English
sentence. These criteria guided the development of our
model. All criteria were met, except the compositional
parse criterion in a few cases. There seem to be
unavoidable special cases which can not be captured in
compositional tense, adverb, and temporal connective
rules. For instance, the meanings of some adverbs require
tense information to determine their correct representations
(e.g. just).

To extract this temporal information from a sentence, it must be parsed into a semantic representation which captures the meaning of tense, temporal adverbs, and temporal connectives. Representations were developed for the basic tenses, some temporal adverbs, as well as some of the temporal connectives. Five criteria were suggested for judging these representations, and based on these criteria the representations were judged.</abstract>

One difference between this representation and previous representations of tense is how present tense is defined. All past theorists have considered present tense as indicating that the main event is cotemporaneous with the time of utterance. However, aspect of verb seems to affect the meaning of present tense. In present tense sentences, there exists a curious phenomenon which can best be understood by examining the following two sentences: 1. I leave at eight o&apos;clock tomorrow. 2. .1 have a dog tomorrow. Aspect </context>

It can be modified by context, and it can be modified when some event which is cotemporaneous to the utterance event is modified. The past perfect sentence introduces a perfect event and a main event (eat) in addition to the utterance event. If we assume that the main event is modified, then the time of &amp;quot;eating&amp;quot; must overlap 3 o&apos;clock. If it modfies the perfect event, then by the time 3 o&apos;clock came around the &amp;quot;eating&amp;quot; was complete. In general, we adopt the idea that which event is modified is ambiguous, and thus a disjunction of possibilities is asserted. Since Hornstein (1977) and Yip (1985) examined the three adverbials tomorrow, yesterday, and now, we will concentrate on these three. Each of these adverbs shares the fact that they are defined with respect to the time of the utterance event (today is also included in this category of adverbs though not discussed here). The representations of now, tomorrow, and yesterday follow: Now : Now is defined to be a time interval which is cotemporaneous with the utterance event.

See Table 1 for the adverb-tense predictions of our model. Modal readings are ignored in this paper. There are other adverbials which are interpreted relative to the time of utterance (for instance, this week, next week, and last year). It is not difficult to imagine how to represent these adverbials. There are also some adverbials which need not be defined relative to the time of utterance. These i</context>

Most of these relate two events, in much the same way as temporal connectives which will be our next topic. Temporal Connectives A few issues must be examined before we present our representation of temporal connectives. First it should be pointed out that temporal connectives are subordinators. Most subordinators do not restrict the tense of the subordinate clause given the tense of the main clause. The tense of the main clause does restrict the tense of the subordinate clause when the subordinator is a temporal connective. The following results are predicted by Hornstein (1977) : John left when Harry 1. *arrives. 4. arrived. 7. *will come. 2. *is arriving. 5. was arriving. 8. *will be coming. 3. *has arrived. 6. had come. 9. *will have arived. By studying the above example, one might suggest that the tense of the main clause and the tense of the subordinate clause must have the same tense (disregarding progressive and perfect aspects). This seems to be true for all past and present tenses. There are some restrictions of this statement, however, since the will/shall construction of future tense is not allowed in temporal subordinate clauses. As pointed out by Leech (</context>
