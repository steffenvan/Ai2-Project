Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.995052933333333">
A long-standing problem in Natural Language Processing has been a lack of large-scale knowledge
for computers. The emergence of the Web and the rapid increase of information on the Web brought
us to what could be called the ”information explosion era,” and drastically changed the environment
of NLP. The Web is not only a marvelous target for NLP, but also a valuable resource from which
knowledge could be extracted for computers. Motivated by the desire to have a very first opportunity to
discuss early approaches to those issues and to share the state-of-the-art technologies at that time, the
first International Workshop on NLP Challenges in the Information Explosion Era (NLPIX 2008) was
successfully held in conjunction with WWW 2008 in Beijing.
Since the discussion of the first workshop, research and development activities on large-scale text
processing and large-scale knowledge acquisition become much more popular these days. The
large-scale NLP naturally requires large-scale infrastructures, such as neatly-prepared huge corpora,
robust morpho-syntactic tools, and high-performance computing environments. However, such
infrastructures can not be prepared by individual researchers nor research groups alone in general,
although of course we know some exceptions. Based on this motivation, towards much larger-scale
NLP, activities aiming at constructing and sharing the infrastructures have continued. Although
we have found many publications presented in recent conferences/workshops including the above
mentioned workshop, we still do not have opportunities to compare latest approaches, share analysis on
advantages/disadvantages, and discuss possible directions towards further improvement and innovation.
Furthermore, beyond the success of large-scale NLP and knowledge acquisition, we are starting to
face a new problem: how to manage and use the automatically acquired knowledge (AAK in short).
We are still not confident that those large-scale AAK can actually solve real world problems. How to
incorporate the AAK into existing NLP frameworks and how to manage them are yet unsolved issues.
One approach could be some bootstrapping of extracting knowledge and enhancing NLP based on the
knowledge. The representation and standardization of AAK are also emerging important issues. One
of the most highly demanded applications for AAK-based NLP is a semantic search to cope with the
information explosion on the Web. Though our daily life heavily depends on the Web information, our
diversified needs have not been sufficiently satisfied by the existing search engines. AAK-based NLP
can be a key technology to realize a new-generation semantic search, which incorporates enhanced
information access, analysis and organization.
The aim of the second workshop of the series of International Workshop on NLP Challenges in the
Information Explosion Era (NLPIX) is to bring researchers and practitioners together in order to discuss
large-scale and sharable NLP infrastructures, and furthermore to discuss emerging NEW issues beyond
them. The program committee accepted 9 papers that cover wide variety of topics such as lexical
acquisition, lexical semantics, coreference, and information access, many of which are based on very
large scale Web text data.
The invited talks were given by Hang Li (Microsoft Research Asia) and Hoifung Poon (University of
Washington).
