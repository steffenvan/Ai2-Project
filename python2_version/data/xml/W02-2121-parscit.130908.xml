Fig. V. The output of this process should be
(one of) a set of grammatical sentences whose
meaning matches the original semantic input.
We view the generation process as decomposing
the semantic input into pieces, finding lexical re-
sources in a language to realize the decomposed
pieces, and then putting the realizations of the
pieces together in a way that adheres to the syn-
tactic principles of the language.
One of the challenges in multilingual sentence
generation is that different languages seemingly
place different constraints on each of these sub-
processes. A number of researchers have iden-
tified the notion of cross-linguistic divergences
and have noted the difficulty divergences play
in machine translation (including one from an
interlingua). We discuss here three divergences
presented in (Dorr, 1993), selected to illustrate
how divergences affect each stage of generation.

2.1 Conflational divergence

<bodyText confidence="0.998381">
Conflation is the incorporation of some of the
arguments of a predicate into the realization of
the predicate itself. A conflational divergence
occurs when the incorporated argument differs
from one language to another, as in the English
sentence (1) and its French translation (2).

Amy crossed the river by swimming
The English verb swim incorporates the man-
ner of motion, while the French verb traverser
incorporates the path. This divergence illus-
trates that input decomposition cannot be done
independently of the lexical choice the genera-
tor makes. This is problematic for any genera-
tor that makes a priori assumptions about input
decomposition independent of particular words.

The same content of enjoying an activity is re-
alized by the English verb like and the German
adverb gerne. This divergence poses a consid-
erable difficulty for most existing systems. The
difficulty stems from the fact that the realiza-
tion of a clause typically starts with the main
verb which sets up a syntactic context into which
other constituents are fit. It is assumed that this
main verb realizes the predicate at the &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; of
the input. Assuming that the enjoying is the top
predicate, the English case (3) is standard. In
German, on the other hand, the top predicate is
realized by the adverb gerne, typically not seen
as setting up an appropriate syntactic context
into which the remaining arguments can be fit.
In handling this divergence, some existing sys-
tems use non-determinism as to which predicate
syntactic processing starts with ((Stede, 1999);
(Nicolov and Mellish, 2000)2), some use addi-
tional information (about the salient relation in
(Stone and Doran, 1997) and perspective in (El-
hadad et al., 1997)3), or exceptional processing
(parameter :DEMOTE in (Dorr, 1993)).

2.3 Thematic divergence

This divergence affects putting realizations to-
gether in that the mapping between semantic
roles and syntactic positions depends on the
words used. Any system that presupposes a con-
sistent mapping from thematic roles to syntac-
tic positions would require exceptional process-
ing for the divergent cases. For instance, (Dorr,
1993) uses parameters :EXT and : INT.
