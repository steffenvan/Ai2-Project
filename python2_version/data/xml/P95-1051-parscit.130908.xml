<bodyText confidence="0.999724333333333">
The purpose of this paper is to suggest that
quantifiers in natural languages do not have a
fixed truth functional meaning as has long
been held in logical semantics. Instead we
suggest that quantifiers can best be modeled
as complex inference procedures that are
highly dynamic and sensitive to the linguistic
context, as well as time and memory
constraints&apos;.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.977431071428571">
Virtually all computational models of quantification are
based one some variation of the theory of generalized
quantifiers (Barwise and Perry, 1981), and Montague&apos;s
(1974) (henceforth, PTQ).
Using the tools of intensional logic and possible-
worlds semantics, PTQ models were able to cope with
certain context-sensitive aspects of natural language by
devising interpretation relative to a context, where the
context was taken to be an &amp;quot;index&amp;quot; denoting a possible-
world and a point in time. In this framework, the
intension (meaning) of an expression is taken to be a
function from contexts to extensions (denotations).
In what later became known as &amp;quot;indexical semantics&amp;quot;,
Kaplan (1979) suggested adding other coordinates
defining a speaker, a listener, a location, etc. As such, an
utterance such as &amp;quot;I called you yesterday&amp;quot; expressed a
different content whenever the speaker, the listener, or
the time of the utterance changed.
While model-theoretic semantics were able to cope
with certain context-sensitive aspects of natural
language, the intensions (meanings) of quantifiers,
however, as well as other functional words, such as
sentential connectives, are taken to be constant. That is,
such words have the same meaning regardless of the
context (Forbes, 1989). In such a framework, all natural
language quantifiers have their meaning grounded in
terms of two logical operators: V (for all), and 3 (there
exists). Consequently, all natural language quantifiers

are, indirectly, modeled by two logical connectives:
negation and either conjunction or disjunction. In such
an oversimplified model, quantifier ambiguity has often
been translated to scoping ambiguity, and elaborate
models were developed to remedy the problem, by
semanticists (Cooper, 1983; Le Pore et al, 1983; Partee,
1984) as well as computational linguists (Harper, 1992;
Alshawi, 1990; Pereira, 1990; Moran, 1988). The
problem can be illustrated by the following examples:
(la) Every student in CS404 received a grade.
(lb) Every student in CS404 received a course outline.
The syntactic structures of (la) and (lb) are identical,
and thus according to Montague&apos;s PTQ would have the
same translation. Hence, the translation of (lb) would
incorrectly state that students in CS404 received
different course outlines. Instead, the desired reading is
one in which &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; has a wider scope than &amp;quot;every&amp;quot; stating
that there is a single course outline for the course
CS404, an outline that all students received. Clearly,
such resolution depends on general knowledge of the
domain: typically students in the same class receive the
same course outline, but different grades. Due to the
compositionality requirement, PTQ models can not cope
with such inferences. Consequently a number of
syntactically motivated rules that suggest an ad hoc
semantic ordering between functional words are
typically suggested. See, for example, (Moran, 1988)2.
What we suggest, instead, is that quantifiers in natural
language be treated as ambiguous words whose
meaning is dependent on the linguistic context, as well
as time and memory constraints.
2 Disambiguation of Quantifiers
Disambiguation of quantifiers, in our opinion, falls under
the general problem of &amp;quot;lexical disambiguation&amp;quot;, which
is essentially an inferencing problem (Corriveau, 1995).
2
In recent years a number of suggestions have been
made, such as discourse representation theory (DRT)
(Kamp, 1981), and the use of what Cooper (1995) calls the
&amp;quot;background situation&amp;quot;. However, in both approaches the
available context is still &amp;quot;syntactic&amp;quot; in nature, and no
suggestion is made on how relevant background knowledge
can be made available for use in a model-theoretic model.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995978">

<bodyText confidence="0.9782225">
Briefly, the disambiguation of &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; in (la) and (lb) is
determined in an interactive manner by considering all
possible inferences between the underlying concepts.
What we suggest is that the inferencing involved in the
disambiguation of &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; in (la) proceeds as follows:
I. A path from grade and student, s, in addition to
disambiguating grade, determines that grade, g, is a
feature of student.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9600444">
2. Having established this relationship between students
and grades, we assume the fact this relationship is
many-to-many is known.
3. &amp;quot;a grade&amp;quot; now refers to &amp;quot;a student grade&amp;quot;, and thus
there is &amp;quot;a grade&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;every student&amp;quot;.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999536454545454">
What is important to note here is that, by discovering
that grade is a feature of student, we essentially
determined that &amp;quot;grade&amp;quot; is a (skolem) function of
&amp;quot;student&amp;quot;, which is the effect of having &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; fall under the
scope of &amp;quot;every&amp;quot;. However, in contrast to syntactic
approaches that rely on devising ad hoc rules, such a
relation is discovered here by performing inferences
using the properties that hold between the underlying
concepts, resulting in a truly context-sensitive account of
scope ambiguities. The inferencing involved in the
disambiguation of &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; in (lb), proceeds as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996193">
1. A path from course and outline disambiguates outline,
and determines outline to be a feature of course.
2. The relationship between course and outline is
determined to be a one-to-one relationship.
3. A path from course to CS404 determines that CS404 is
a course.
4. Since there is one course, namely CS404, &amp;quot;a course
outline&amp;quot; refers to &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; course outline.

3 Time and Memory Constraints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998306333333333">
In addition to the lingusitic context, we claim that the
meaning of quantifiers is also dependent on time and
memory constraints. For example, consider
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94431">
(2a) Cubans prefer rum over vodka.
(2b) Students in CS404 work in groups.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998853705882353">
Our intuitive reading of (2a) suggests that we have an
implicit &amp;quot;most&amp;quot;, while in (2b) we have an implicit &amp;quot;all&amp;quot;.
We argue that such inferences are dependent on time
constraints and constraints on working memory. For
example, since the set of students in CS404 is a much
smaller set than the set of &amp;quot;Cubans&amp;quot;, it is conceivable
that we are able to perform an exhaustive search over
the set of all students in CS404 to verify the proposition
in (2b) within some time and memory constraints. In
(2a), however, we are most likely performing a
&amp;quot;generalization&amp;quot; based on few examples that are
currently activated in short-term memory (STM). Our
suggestion of the role of time and memory constraints is
based on our view of properties and their negation We
suggest that there are three ways to conceive of
properties and their negation, as shown in Figure 1
below.

In (a), we take the view that if we have no information
regarding P(x), then, we cannot decide on —.1)(x). In (b),
we take the view that if P can not be confirmed of some
entity x, then P(x) is assumed to be false3. In (c),
however, we take the view that if there is no evidence to
negate P(x), then assume P(x). Note that model (c)
essentially allows one to &amp;quot;generalize&amp;quot;, given no evidence
to the contrary - or, given an overwhelming positive
evidence. Of course, formally speaking, we are
interested in defining the exact circumstances under
which models (a) through (c) might be appropriate. We
believe that the three models are used, depending on
the context, time, and memory constraints. In model (c),
we believe the truth (or falsity) of a certain property
P(x) is a function of the following:

cf(P,x) the degree to which P is &apos;generally&amp;quot; believed of x.
It is assumed here that cf is a value v E [0,1]. That
is, a value that is either undefined, or a real value
between 0 and 1. We also suggest that this value is
constantly modified (re-enforced) through a feedback
mechanism, as more examples are experienced4.

4 Role of Cognitive Constraints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998538625">
The basic problem is one of interpreting statements of
the form every C P (the set-theoretic counterpart of the
wff Vx(C(x)--&gt;P(x)), where C has an indeterminate
cardinality. Verifying every C P is depicted graphically in
Figure 2. It is assumed that the property P is generally
attributed to members of the concept C with certainty
cf(C,P), where cf(C,P)=0 represents the fact that P is not
generally assumed of objects in C. On the other hand, a
value of cf near 1, represents a strong bias towards
believing P of C at face value. In the former case, the
processing will depend little, if at all, on our general
belief, but more on the actual instances. In the latter
case, and especially when faced with time and memory
constraints, more weight might be given to prior
stereotyped knowledge that we might have
accumulated. More precisely:

1. An attempt at an exhaustive verification of all the
elements in the set C is first made (this is the default
meaning of &amp;quot;every&amp;quot;).
2. If time and memory capacity allow the processing of all
the elements in C, then the result is &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if np =CI
(that is, if every C P), and &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; otherwise.
3. If time and/or memory constraints do not allow an
exhaustive verification, then we will attempt making a
decision based on the evidence at hand, where the
evidence is based on cf, an, np (a suggested function is
given below).
4. In 3, cf is computed from C elements that are currently
active in short-term memory (if any), otherwise cf is the
current value associated with C the KB.

In the case of 3, the final output is determined as a

where &amp; and co are quantifier-specific parameters. In the
case of &amp;quot;every&amp;quot;, the function in (13) states that, in the
absence of time and memory resources to process every
C P exhaustively, the result of the process is &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if
there is an overwhelming positive evidence (high value
for e), and if the there is some prior stereotyped belief
supporting this inference (i.e., if cf &gt; @ &gt; 0). This
essentially amounts to processing every CF as most C P
(example (2a)).
If &amp;quot;most&amp;quot; was the quantifier we started with, then the
function in (13) and the above procedure can be applied,
although smaller values for c and o) will be assigned. At
this point it should be noted that the above function is a
generalization of the theory of generalized quantifiers,
where quantifiers can be interpreted using this function

We are currently in the process of formalizing our
model, and hope to define a context-sensitive model for
quantification that is also dependent on time and
memory constraints. In addition to the &amp;quot;cognitive
plausibility&amp;quot; requirement, we require that the model
preserve formal properties that are generally attributed
to quantifiers in natural language.

What we suggest, instead, is that quantifiers in natural language be treated as ambiguous words whose meaning is dependent on the linguistic context, as well as time and memory constraints. 2 Disambiguation of Quantifiers Disambiguation of quantifiers, in our opinion, falls under the general problem of &amp;quot;lexical disambiguation&amp;quot;, which is essentially an inferencing problem (Corriveau, 1995). 2 In recent years a number of suggestions have been made, such as discourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1981), and the use of what Cooper (1995) calls the &amp;quot;background situation&amp;quot;. However, in both approaches the available context is still &amp;quot;syntactic&amp;quot; in nature, and no suggestion is made on how relevant background knowledge can be made available for use in a model-theoretic model. 323 Briefly, the disambiguation of &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; in (la) and (lb) is determined in an interactive manner by considering all possible inferences between the underlying concepts. What we suggest is that the inferencing involved in the disambiguation of &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; in (la) proceeds as follows: I. A path from grade and student, s, in addition to d</context>

Using the tools of intensional logic and possibleworlds semantics, PTQ models were able to cope with certain context-sensitive aspects of natural language by devising interpretation relative to a context, where the context was taken to be an &amp;quot;index&amp;quot; denoting a possibleworld and a point in time. In this framework, the intension (meaning) of an expression is taken to be a function from contexts to extensions (denotations). In what later became known as &amp;quot;indexical semantics&amp;quot;, Kaplan (1979) suggested adding other coordinates defining a speaker, a listener, a location, etc. As such, an utterance such as &amp;quot;I called you yesterday&amp;quot; expressed a different content whenever the speaker, the listener, or the time of the utterance changed. While model-theoretic semantics were able to cope with certain context-sensitive aspects of natural language, the intensions (meanings) of quantifiers, however, as well as other functional words, such as sentential connectives, are taken to be constant. That is, such words have the same meaning regardless of the context (Forbes, 1989). In such a framewor</context>
