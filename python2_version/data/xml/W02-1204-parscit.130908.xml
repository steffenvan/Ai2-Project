<bodyText confidence="0.9995882">
ISLE is a continuation of the long standing EAGLES initiative and it is supported by EC and NSF under the
Human Language Technology (HLT) programme. Its objective is to develop widely agreed and urgently
demanded standards and guidelines for infrastructural language resources, tools, and HLT products.
EAGLES itself is a well-known trademark and point of reference for HLT projects and products and its
previous results have already become de facto widely adopted standards. Multilingual computational
lexicons, natural interaction and multimodality, and evaluation are the three areas targeted by ISLE. In the
first section of the paper we describe the overall goals and methodology of EAGLES/ISLE, in the second
section we focus on the work of the Computational Lexicon Working Group, introducing its work strategy
and the preliminary guidelines of a standard framework for multilingual computational lexicons, based on a
general schema for the “Multilingual ISLE Lexical Entry” (MILE).

1 Introducing EAGLES/ISLE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987177421052632">
ISLE (International Standards for Language
Engineering) is a continuation of the long
standing European EAGLES (Expert Advisory
Group for Language Engineering Standards)
initiative (Calzolari et al., 1996), carried out
through a number of subsequent projects
funded by the European Commission (EC)
since 1993. ISLE is an initiative under the
Human Language Technology (HLT)
programme within the EU-US International
Research Co-operation with the aim to develop
and promote widely agreed and urgently
demanded HLT standards, common guidelines
and best practice recommendations for
infrastructural language resources (Zampolli,
1998), (Calzolari, 1998), tools that exploit
them, and language engineering products.
Object of EAGLES/ISLE are large-scale
language resources (such as text corpora,
computational lexicons, speech corpora,
multimodal resources), means of manipulating
such knowledge via computational linguistic
formalisms, mark-up languages and various
software tools and means of assessing and
evaluating resources, tools and products
(EAGLES EWG final report, 1996).
EAGLES was set up to determine which
aspects of our field are open to short-term de
facto standardisation and to encourage the
development of such standards for the benefit
of consumers and producers of language
technology, through bringing together
representatives of major collaborative
European R&amp;D projects, and of HLT industry,
in relevant areas. In this respect, more than 150
leading industrial and academic players in the
HLT field have actively participated in the
definition of this initiative and have lent
invaluable support to its execution.
Successful standards are those which respond
to commonly perceived needs or aid in
overcoming common problems. In terms of
offering workable, compromise solutions, they
must be based on some solid platform of
accepted facts and acceptable practices.
The current ISLE project1 targets the three
areas of :
-multilingual computational lexicons2,
-natural interaction and multimodality
(NIMM)3 ,
-evaluation of HLT systems4.
For multilingual computational lexicons, ISLE
goals are: i) extending EAGLES work on
lexical semantics, necessary to establish inter-
language links; ii) designing and proposing
standards for multilingual lexicons; iii)
developing a prototype tool to implement
lexicon guidelines and standards; iv) creating
exemplary EAGLES-conformant sample
lexicons and tagging exemplary corpora for
validation purposes; v) developing
standardised evaluation procedures for
lexicons.
For NIMM, ISLE work is targeted to develop
guidelines for: i) the creation of NIMM data
resources; ii) interpretative annotation of
NIMM data, including spoken dialogue in
NIMM contexts; iii) metadata descriptions for
large NIMM resources; iv) annotation of
discourse phenomena.
For evaluation, ISLE is working on: i) quality
models for machine translation systems; ii)
maintenance of previous guidelines - in an ISO
based framework (ISO 9126, ISO 14598).
Three Working Groups, and their sub-groups,
carry out the work, according to the EAGLES

methodology, with experts from both the EU
and US, acting as a catalyst in order to pool
concrete results coming from major
international/national/industrial projects.
Relevant common practices or upcoming
standards are being used where appropriate as
input to EAGLES/ISLE work. Numerous
theories, approaches, and systems are being
taken into account as any recommendation for
harmonisation must take into account the needs
and nature of the different major contemporary
approaches.
Results are widely disseminated, after due
validation in collaboration with EU and US
HLT R&amp;D projects, National projects, and
industry.
In the following we concentrate on the
Computational Lexicon Working Group
(CLWG), trying to describe its specific
methodology and its goal of establishing a
general and consensual standardized
environment for the development and
integration of multilingual resources. The
general vision adheres to the idea of enhancing
the sharing and reusability of multilingual
lexical resources, by promoting the definition
of a common parlance for the community of
multilingual HLT and computational lexicon
developers. The CLWG pursues this goal by
proposing a general schema for the encoding of
multilingual lexical information, the MILE
(Multilingual ISLE Lexical Entry). This has to
be intended as a meta-entry, acting as a
common representational layer for multilingual
lexical resources.
We describe the preliminary proposals of
guidelines for the MILE, highlighting some
methodological principles applied in previous
EAGLES.

Existing EAGLES results in the Lexicon and
Corpus areas are currently adopted by an
impressive number of European - and recently
also National – projects and has became the
“de-facto standard” for LR in Europe. This is a
very good measure of the impact – and of the
need – of such a standardisation initiative in
the HLT sector. To mention just a few key
examples:
− the LE PAROLE/SIMPLE resources
(morphological/syntactic/semantic lexicons
and corpora for 12 EU languages (Zampolli,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.688869666666667">
1997) (Ruimy et al., 1998) (Lenci et al.,
1999) (Bel et al., 2000) rely on EAGLES
results (Sanfilippo et al., 1996) (Sanfilippo

et al., 1999), and are now being enlarged to
real-size lexicons through many National
Projects, thus building a really large
infrastructural platform of harmonised
lexicons in Europe, sharing the same model;
− the ELRA Validation Manuals for Lexicons
(Underwood and Navarreta, 1997) and
Corpora (Burnard et al., 1997) are based on
EAGLES guidelines;
− morpho-syntactic encoding of lexicons and
tagging of corpora in a very large number of
EU, international and national projects – and
for more than 20 languages — is conformant
to EAGLES recommendations (Monachini
and Calzolari, 1996) (Monachini and
Calzolari, 1999) (Leech and Wilson, 1996).
Standards must emerge from state-of-the-art
developments. The process of standardisation,
although by its own nature not intrinsically
innovative, must – and actually does – proceed
shoulder to shoulder with the most advanced
research. Since ISLE involves many bodies
active in EU-US NLP and speech projects,
close collaboration with these projects is
assured and, significantly, free manpower has
been contributed by the projects, as a sign of
both their commitment and of the crucial
importance they place on reusability issues.
Lexical semantics has always represented a
sort of wild frontier in the investigation of
natural language. In fact, the number of open
issues in lexical semantics both on the
representational, architectural and content level
might induce an actually unjustified negative
attitude towards the possibility of designing
standards in this difficult territory. Rather to
the contrary, standardisation must be conceived
as enucleating and singling out the areas in the
open field of lexical semantics, that already
present themselves with a clear and high
degree of stability, although this is often
hidden behind a number of formal differences
or representational variants, that prevent the
possibility of exploiting and enhancing the
aspects of commonality and the already
consolidated achievements.
With no intent of imposing any constraints on
investigation and experimentation, the ISLE
CLWG rather aims at selecting mature areas
and results in computational lexical semantics
and in multilingual lexicons, which can also be
regarded as stabilised achievements, thus to be
used as the basis for future research. Therefore,
consolidation of a standards proposal must be
viewed, by necessity, as a slow process
comprising, after the phase of putting forward
proposals, a cyclical phase involving ISLE
external groups and projects with: i) careful
evaluation and testing of recommendations in
concrete applications; ii) application, if
appropriate, to a large number of European
languages; iii) feedback on and readjustment of
the proposals until a stable platform is reached;
dissemination and promotion of consensual
recommendations.
The process of standard definition undertaken
by CLWG represents an essential interface
between advanced research in the field of
multilingual lexical semantics, and the
practical task of developing resources for HLT
systems and applications. It is through this
interface that the crucial trade-off between
research practice and applicative needs will
actually be achieved.
In what follows we briefly describe the two-
step strategy adopted in the journey towards
standards design: a first activity of survey of
existing multilingual resources both in the
European and American research and industrial
scenarios. A second ongoing phase aiming at
individuating hot areas on the domains of
multilingual lexical resources, which call – and
de facto can access to – a process of
standardisation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979667">
2.1 Preliminary Step: the Survey Phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999458">
Following the well established EAGLES
methodology, the first priority was to do a
wide-range survey of bilingual/multilingual (or
semantic monolingual) lexicons, so as to reach
a fair level of coverage of existing lexical
resources. With respect to this target, one of
the first objectives is to discover and list the
(maximal) set of (granular) basic notions
needed to describe the multilingual level. The
Survey of existing lexicons (Calzolari,
Grishman and Palmer, 2001) has been
accompanied by the analysis of the
requirements of a few multilingual
applications, and by the parallel analysis of
typical cross-lingually complex phenomena5.
The main issue is how to state in the most
proper way the translation correspondences
among entries in the multilingual lexicon. The
passage from source language (SL) to target
language (TL) makes it necessary to express
very complex and articulated transfer
conditions, which have to take into account as
difficult and pervasive phenomena as argument
switching, multi-word expressions,
collocational patterns, etc.
The function of an entry in a multilingual
lexicon is to supply enough information to
allow the system to identify a distinct sense of
a word or phrase in SL, in many different
contexts, and reliably associate each context
with the most appropriate translation. The first
step is to determine, of all the information that
can be associated with SL lexical entries, what
is the most relevant to a particular task. We
decided to focus the work of survey and
subsequent recommendations around two
major broad categories of application: Machine
Translation and Cross-Language Information
Retrieval. They have partially
different/complementary needs, and can be
considered to represent the requirements of
other application types. It is necessary in fact
to ensure that any guidelines meet the
requirements of industrial applications and that
they are implementable.
In the Survey, some Korean and Japanese
examples were present in the case study
dedicated to relevant cross-linguistic
phenomena, (e. g. sense distinctions according
to variation in syntactic frames/semantic type/

2.2 Towards the Recommendation Phase:
designing the MILE Architecture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998967194915255">
Since the architecture of the PAROLE-
SIMPLE lexicons has been selected to provide
the necessary bootstrapping basis for the
stepwise refinement cycle leading to MILE, we
briefly provide here some information about
these resources. The design of the SIMPLE
lexicons (Bel et al., 2000) complies with the
EAGLES Lexicon/Semantics Working Group
guidelines (Sanfilippo et al., 1999), and the set
of recommended semantic notions.
The SIMPLE lexicons are built as a new layer
connected to the PAROLE syntactic layer, and
encode structured “semantic types” and
semantic (subcategorization) frames. They
cover 12 languages (Catalan, Danish, Dutch,
English, Finnish, French, German, Greek,
Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish). The
common model is designed to facilitate future
cross-language linking: they share the same
core ontology and the same set of semantic
templates.
The “conceptual core” of the lexicons consists
of the basic structured set of “semantic types”
(the SIMPLE ontology) and the basic set of
notions to be encoded for each Semantic Unit
(SemU): domain information, lexicographic
gloss, argument structure, selectional
restrictions/preferences on the arguments,
event type, links of the arguments to the
syntactic subcategorization frames as
represented in the PAROLE lexicons, ‘qualia’
structure, following the Generative Lexicon
(Pustejovsky, 1995), semantic relations, etc..
SIMPLE and PAROLE lexicons are layered
resources, with links between the
morphological and syntactic layers expressed
in PAROLE and the semantic information
present in SIMPLE.
In its general design, also MILE is envisaged
as a highly modular and layered architecture as
described in Calzolari et al. (2001). Modularity
concerns the “horizontal” MILE organization,
in which independent and yet linked modules
target different dimensions of lexical entries.
On the other hand, at the “vertical” level, a
layered organization is necessary to allow for
different degrees of granularity of lexical
descriptions, so that both “shallow” and “deep”
representations of lexical items can be
captured. This feature is particularly crucial in
order to stay open to the different styles and
approaches to the lexicon adopted by existing
multilingual systems.
At the top level, MILE includes two main
modules, mono-MILE, providing monolingual
lexical representations, and multi-MILE, where
multilingual correspondences are defined. With
this design choice the ISLE-CLWG intends
also to address the particularly complex and
yet crucial issue of multilingual resource
development through the integration of
monolingual computational lexicons. As in the
reference model, PAROLE/SIMPLE, Mono-
MILE is organized into independent modules,
respectively providing morphological,
syntactic and semantic descriptions. The latter
surely represents the core and the most
challenging part of the ISLE-CLWG activities,
together with the two other crucial topics of
collocations and multi-word expressions,
which have often remained outside
astandardization initiatives, and nevertheless
have a crucial role at the multilingual level.
This bias is motivated by the necessity of
providing an answer to the most urgent needs
and desiderata of next generation HLT, as also
expressed by the industrial partners
participating to the project. With respect to the
issue of the representation of multi-word
expressions in computational lexicons, the
ISLE-CLWG is actively cooperating with the
NSF sponsored XMELLT project (Calzolari et
al., 2002).
Multi-MILE specifies a formal environment
for the characterization of multilingual
correspondences between lexical items. In
particular, source and target lexical entries can
be linked by exploiting (possibly combined)
aspects of their monolingual descriptions.
Moreover, in multi-MILE both syntactic and
semantic lexical representations can also be
enriched, so as to achieve the granularity of
lexical description required to establish proper
multilingual correspondences, and which is
possibly lacking in the original monolingual
lexicons.
According to the ISLE approach, monolingual
lexicons can thus be regarded as pivot lexical
repositories, on top of which various language-
to-language multilingual modules can be
defined, where lexical correspondences are
established by partly exploiting and partly
enriching the monolingual descriptions. This
architecture guarantees the independence of
monolingual descriptions while allowing for
the maximum degree of flexibility and
consistency in reusing existing monolingual
resources to build new bilingual lexicons.
The MILE architecture is intended to provide
the common representational environment
needed to implement such an approach to
multilingual resource development, with the
goal of maximizing the reuse, integration and
extension of existing monolingual
computational lexicons.
In the process of specifying the various
components of MILE, the ISLE-CLWG has
adopted a two-track strategy:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.58538225">
1) identifying the lexical dimensions and
the various types of information which
are relevant to establish multilingual
correspondences;
2) idefining a suitable formal data model
to encode this information as well as
the operations required at the
multilingual level.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999592580645161">
To tackle point 1) the survey of the available
computational lexicons (see section 2.1) has
been complemented with a more
lexicographic-based effort, to identify the types
of information used in bilingual dictionaries to
establish translation equivalents. To this
purpose, the CLWG has organized two “task
forces” with the responsibility respectively of
creating a sample of lexical entries and
investigating the use of the so-called sense
indicators in traditional bilingual dictionaries.
The work on sense indicators has been carried
out mainly by S. Atkins and P. Bouillon: sense
indicators are the ‘clues’ given by the
lexicographer to the bilingual dictionary users
in order to guide them to the most appropriate
choice of equivalence in the foreign language.
The source word with its syntactic category,
the target words and the sense indicators were
automatically extracted from an English-
French dictionary and then the sense indicators
have been classified on the basis of lexical
relevant facts (cf. Atkins et al., 2002).
The aim of these activities has been twofold:
on one hand, we wanted to be able to highlight
the various types of information useful to
determine the transfer conditions; on the other,
we had to explore and evaluate the full
expressive potentialities provided by the
reference computational model (i.e. the
PAROLE-SIMPLE architecture).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999906">
3.2 The MILE Data Structure and
Lexicographic Environment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999360294871795">
The CLWG is setting up a lexicographic
environment consisting of the following four
main components: i) the MILE Entry Skeleton,
ii) the MILE Lexical Data Categories, iii) the
MILE Shared Lexical Objects, iv) the ISLE
Lexicographic Station.
The MILE Entry Skeleton, formalized as an
XML DTD, is an Entity Relationship model
that will define the general constraints for the
construction of multilingual entries, as well as
the grammar to build the whole array of lexical
elements needed for a given lexical
description.
The MILE Lexical Data Categories will
provide the lexical objects (syntactic and
semantic features, semantic relations, syntactic
constructions, predicates and arguments etc..)
that are the basic components of MILE-
conformant lexical entries. Lexical Data
Categories will be organized in a hierarchy and
will be defined using RDF schema (Brickley
and Guha, 2000) to formalize their properties
and make their “semantics” explicit.
The MILE Shared Lexical Objects will
instantiate the MILE Lexical Data Categories,
to be used to build in an easy and
straightforward way lexical entries. These will
include main syntactic constructions, basic
operations and conditions to establish
multilingual links, macro-semantic objects,
such as lexical conceptual templates acting as
general constraints for the encoding of
semantic units.
For instance, at the multilingual level it is
possible to identify a first set of basic
operations that are at the basis of multilingual
transfer tests and actions. This would include:
i) adding to a monolingual lexical entry a new
syntactic position (required for a given
translation correspondence); ii) adding to a
monolingual semantic description a new
semantic feature (required for a given
translation correspondence); iii) constraining
the source-target correspondence to apply only
if an existing syntactic position is realized by a
certain type of phrase, etc.
Lexical objects will be identified by an URI
and will act as a common resources for lexical
representation, to be in turn described by RDF
metadata. The defined lexical objects will be
used by the lexicon (or applications)
developers to build and target lexical data at a
higher level of abstraction. Thus, they have to
be seen as a step in the direction of simplifying
and improving the usability of the MILE
recommendations.
The ISLE Lexicographic Station is a
development platform used to automatically
generate a prototype tool starting from the
MILE DTD. The aim of this prototype tool is
to i) exemplify the MILE entry ii) make
extensive use of already existing monolingual
resources, and iii) eventually test the guidelines
in a real scenario. This situation led us to
define a lexicographic station development
platform that guarantees the portability of the
final prototype to the final specifications as
well as to existing monolingual resources
which will serve as the basic data for MILE
(for a detailed description, cf. Villegas and Bel,
2002).
Both at monolingual and multilingual level
(but with particular emphasis on the latter),
ISLE intends to start up the incremental
definition of a more Object-Oriented layer for
lexical description and to foster the vision of
open and distributed lexicons, with elements
possibly residing in different sites of the web.

3 Enlargement to Asian Languages
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984422102564103">
An enlargement of the group to involve also
Asian languages is going on and
representatives of Chinese, Japanese, Korean,
and Thai languages have contributed to ISLE
work and participated in some ISLE
workshops.
The cooperation between Asia and Europe has
to be pursued also through new common
initiatives, as the expression of interest for the
creation of an Open Distributed Lexical
Infrastructure that has been submitted to the
European Commission for the 6th Framework
Programme for Research.
This expression of interest is supported by
many non-EU participants, as the newly
formed Asian Federation of Natural Language
Processing Associations (AFNLPA), the
Department of Computer Science of the
University of Tokyo, the Korean KAIST and
KORTERM, the Taiwanese Institute of
Linguistics of the Academia Sinica.
The Open Distributed Lexical Infrastructure, a
natural development of the ISLE model, can be
seen as a new paradigm of distributed lexicon
creation and maintenance and it would be a
step of great importance for the fulfilment of
the vision of the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee,
1998). The creation of such infrastructure has
to be consensual and in this regard needs the
collaboration of a group of languages as large
as possible (for example the AFNLPA brings
into the initiative many Asian languages, such
as Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese,
Korean, Malay, Tamil, Thai and Urdu). A
prerequisite in order to reach interoperability is
the existence of best practices and standards
that have been consensually agreed on or have
been submitted to the international community
as de-facto standards.

In this paper we presented overall goals and
methodological principles of the
standardization activity of EAGLES/ISLE. In
particular, we describe the work of the
Computational Lexicon Working Group and its
effort towards recommendations, focussing on
the MILE, the multilingual lexical meta-entry
proposed as the standard representational
format for multilingual computational lexical
resources. Lexical representation is articulated
over different information layers, each
factoring out different, but possibly inter-
related, linguistic facets of information,
relevant in order to establish multilingual
lexical links. We also pointed out the necessity
to involve a broader group of languages in
order to ensure the achievement of a real

<abstract confidence="0.970890329545454">ISLE is a continuation of the long standing EAGLES initiative and it is supported by EC and NSF under the Human Language Technology (HLT) programme. Its objective is to develop widely agreed and urgently demanded standards and guidelines for infrastructural language resources, tools, and HLT products. EAGLES itself is a well-known trademark and point of reference for HLT projects and products and its results have already become facto adopted standards. Multilingual computational lexicons, natural interaction and multimodality, and evaluation are the three areas targeted by ISLE. In the first section of the paper we describe the overall goals and methodology of EAGLES/ISLE, in the second section we focus on the work of the Computational Lexicon Working Group, introducing its work strategy and the preliminary guidelines of a standard framework for multilingual computational lexicons, based on a general schema for the “Multilingual ISLE Lexical Entry” (MILE). 1 Introducing EAGLES/ISLE Standards for Language is a continuation of the long European EAGLES Advisory Group for Language Engineering Standards) (Calzolari 1996), carried out through a number of subsequent projects funded by the European Commission (EC) since 1993. ISLE is an initiative under the Human Language Technology (HLT) programme within the EU-US International Research Co-operation with the aim to develop and promote widely agreed and urgently demanded HLT standards, common guidelines and best practice recommendations for infrastructural language resources (Zampolli, 1998), (Calzolari, 1998), tools that exploit them, and language engineering products. Object of EAGLES/ISLE are large-scale language resources (such as text corpora, computational lexicons, speech corpora, multimodal resources), means of manipulating such knowledge via computational linguistic formalisms, mark-up languages and various software tools and means of assessing and evaluating resources, tools and (EAGLES EWG final report, 1996). EAGLES was set up to determine which of our field are open to short-term and to encourage the development of such standards for the benefit of consumers and producers of language technology, through bringing together representatives of major collaborative European R&amp;D projects, and of HLT industry, in relevant areas. In this respect, more than 150 leading industrial and academic players in the HLT field have actively participated in the definition of this initiative and have lent invaluable support to its execution. Successful standards are those which respond to commonly perceived needs or aid in overcoming common problems. In terms of offering workable, compromise solutions, they must be based on some solid platform of accepted facts and acceptable practices. current ISLE targets the three areas of : computational -natural interaction and multimodality , of HLT computational ISLE goals are: i) extending EAGLES work on lexical semantics, necessary to establish interlanguage links; ii) designing and proposing standards for multilingual lexicons; iii) developing a prototype tool to implement lexicon guidelines and standards; iv) creating exemplary EAGLES-conformant sample lexicons and tagging exemplary corpora for validation purposes; v) developing standardised evaluation procedures for lexicons. ISLE work is targeted to develop guidelines for: i) the creation of NIMM data resources; ii) interpretative annotation of NIMM data, including spoken dialogue in NIMM contexts; iii) metadata descriptions for large NIMM resources; iv) annotation of discourse phenomena. ISLE is working on: i) quality models for machine translation systems; ii) maintenance of previous guidelines in an ISO based framework (ISO 9126, ISO 14598). Three Working Groups, and their sub-groups, carry out the work, according to the EAGLES</abstract>

Hovy. methodology, with experts from both the EU and US, acting as a catalyst in order to pool concrete results coming from major international/national/industrial projects. Relevant common practices or upcoming standards are being used where appropriate as input to EAGLES/ISLE work. Numerous theories, approaches, and systems are being taken into account as any recommendation for harmonisation must take into account the needs and nature of the different major contemporary approaches. Results are widely disseminated, after due validation in collaboration with EU and US HLT R&amp;D projects, National projects, and industry. In the following we concentrate on the Computational Lexicon Working Group (CLWG), trying to describe its specific methodology and its goal of establishing a general and consensual standardized environment for the development and integration of multilingual resources. The general vision adheres to the idea of enhancing the sharing and reusability of multilingual lexical resources, by promoting the definition of a common parlance for the community of multilingual HLT and computational lexicon developers. The CLWG pursues this goal by proposing a general schema for the encoding of lexical information, the (Multilingual ISLE Lexical Entry). This has to be intended as a meta-entry, acting as a common representational layer for multilingual lexical resources. We describe the preliminary proposals of guidelines for the MILE, highlighting some methodological principles applied in previous EAGLES. 2 The Computational L exicon Working Group Existing EAGLES results in the Lexicon and Corpus areas are currently adopted by an impressive number of European and recently also National – projects and has became the for LR in Europe. This is a very good measure of the impact – and of the need – of such a standardisation initiative in the HLT sector. To mention just a few key examples: LE PAROLE/SIMPLE resources (morphological/syntactic/semantic lexicons and corpora for 12 EU languages (Zampolli, (Ruimy 1998) (Lenci (Bel 2000) rely on EAGLES (Sanfilippo 1996) (Sanfilippo 1999), and are now being enlarged real-size lexicons through many National Projects, thus building a really large infrastructural platform of harmonised lexicons in Europe, sharing the same model; ELRA Validation Manuals for Lexicons (Underwood and Navarreta, 1997) and (Burnard 1997) are based on EAGLES guidelines; encoding of lexicons and tagging of corpora in a very large number of EU, international and national projects – for more than 20 languages — is conformant to EAGLES recommendations (Monachini and Calzolari, 1996) (Monachini and Calzolari, 1999) (Leech and Wilson, 1996). Standards must emerge from state-of-the-art developments. The process of standardisation, although by its own nature not intrinsically innovative, must – and actually does – proceed shoulder to shoulder with the most advanced research. Since ISLE involves many bodies active in EU-US NLP and speech projects, close collaboration with these projects is assured and, significantly, free manpower has been contributed by the projects, as a sign of both their commitment and of the crucial importance they place on reusability issues. Lexical semantics has always represented a of frontier the investigation of natural language. In fact, the number of open issues in lexical semantics both on the representational, architectural and content level might induce an actually unjustified negative attitude towards the possibility of designing standards in this difficult territory. Rather to the contrary, standardisation must be conceived as enucleating and singling out the areas in the open field of lexical semantics, that already present themselves with a clear and high degree of stability, although this is often hidden behind a number of formal differences or representational variants, that prevent the possibility of exploiting and enhancing the aspects of commonality and the already consolidated achievements. With no intent of imposing any constraints on investigation and experimentation, the ISLE CLWG rather aims at selecting mature areas and results in computational lexical semantics and in multilingual lexicons, which can also be regarded as stabilised achievements, thus to be used as the basis for future research. Therefore, consolidation of a standards proposal must be viewed, by necessity, as a slow process comprising, after the phase of putting forward proposals, a cyclical phase involving ISLE external groups and projects with: i) careful evaluation and testing of recommendations in concrete applications; ii) application, if appropriate, to a large number of European languages; iii) feedback on and readjustment of the proposals until a stable platform is reached; dissemination and promotion of consensual recommendations. The process of standard definition undertaken by CLWG represents an essential interface between advanced research in the field of multilingual lexical semantics, and the practical task of developing resources for HLT systems and applications. It is through this interface that the crucial trade-off between research practice and applicative needs will actually be achieved. In what follows we briefly describe the twostep strategy adopted in the journey towards standards design: a first activity of survey of existing multilingual resources both in the European and American research and industrial scenarios. A second ongoing phase aiming at individuating hot areas on the domains of multilingual lexical resources, which call – and facto access to – a process of standardisation. 2.1 Preliminary Step: the Survey Phase Following the well established EAGLES methodology, the first priority was to do a wide-range survey of bilingual/multilingual (or semantic monolingual) lexicons, so as to reach a fair level of coverage of existing lexical resources. With respect to this target, one of the first objectives is to discover and list the set of (granular) notions needed to describe the multilingual level. The existing lexicons (Calzolari, Grishman and Palmer, 2001) has been accompanied by the analysis of the requirements of a few multilingual applications, and by the parallel analysis of cross-lingually complex The main issue is how to state in the most proper way the translation correspondences among entries in the multilingual lexicon. The passage from source language (SL) to target language (TL) makes it necessary to express very complex and articulated transfer conditions, which have to take into account as difficult and pervasive phenomena as argument switching, multi-word collocational patterns, etc. The function of an entry in a multilingual lexicon is to supply enough information to allow the system to identify a distinct sense of a word or phrase in SL, in many different contexts, and reliably associate each context with the most appropriate translation. The first step is to determine, of all the information that can be associated with SL lexical entries, what is the most relevant to a particular task. We decided to focus the work of survey and subsequent recommendations around two major broad categories of application: Machine Translation and Cross-Language Information Retrieval. They have different/complementary needs, and can be considered to represent the requirements of other application types. It is necessary in fact to ensure that any guidelines meet the requirements of industrial applications and that they are implementable. In the Survey, some Korean and Japanese were present in the study dedicated to relevant cross-linguistic phenomena, (e. g. sense distinctions according to variation in syntactic frames/semantic type/</abstract>

The design of the SIMPLE (Bel 2000) complies with the EAGLES Lexicon/Semantics Working Group (Sanfilippo 1999), and the set of recommended semantic notions. The SIMPLE lexicons are built as a new layer connected to the PAROLE syntactic layer, and encode structured “semantic types” and semantic (subcategorization) frames. They</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.993630513043479">common model is designed to facilitate future cross-language linking: they share the same ontology the same set of The “conceptual core” of the lexicons consists of the basic structured set of “semantic types” and the basic set of notions to be encoded for each Semantic Unit domain information, lexicographic gloss, argument structure, selectional restrictions/preferences on the arguments, event type, links of the arguments to the syntactic subcategorization frames as represented in the PAROLE lexicons, ‘qualia’ structure, following the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1995), semantic relations, etc.. SIMPLE and PAROLE lexicons are layered resources, with links between the morphological and syntactic layers expressed in PAROLE and the semantic information present in SIMPLE. In its general design, also MILE is envisaged a highly as in Calzolari al. Modularity concerns the “horizontal” MILE organization, in which independent and yet linked modules target different dimensions of lexical entries. On the other hand, at the “vertical” level, a layered organization is necessary to allow for different degrees of granularity of lexical descriptions, so that both “shallow” and “deep” representations of lexical items can be captured. This feature is particularly crucial in order to stay open to the different styles and approaches to the lexicon adopted by existing multilingual systems. At the top level, MILE includes two main providing monolingual representations, and where multilingual correspondences are defined. With this design choice the ISLE-CLWG intends also to address the particularly complex and yet crucial issue of multilingual resource development through the integration of monolingual computational lexicons. As in the reference model, PAROLE/SIMPLE, Mono- MILE is organized into independent modules, providing The latter surely represents the core and the most challenging part of the ISLE-CLWG activities, together with the two other crucial topics of which have often remained outside astandardization initiatives, and nevertheless have a crucial role at the multilingual level. This bias is motivated by the necessity of providing an answer to the most urgent needs and desiderata of next generation HLT, as also expressed by the industrial partners participating to the project. With respect to the issue of the representation of multi-word expressions in computational lexicons, the ISLE-CLWG is actively cooperating with the sponsored XMELLT project (Calzolari Multi-MILE specifies a formal environment for the characterization of multilingual correspondences between lexical items. In particular, source and target lexical entries can be linked by exploiting (possibly combined) aspects of their monolingual descriptions. Moreover, in multi-MILE both syntactic and semantic lexical representations can also be enriched, so as to achieve the granularity of lexical description required to establish proper multilingual correspondences, and which is possibly lacking in the original monolingual lexicons. According to the ISLE approach, monolingual can thus be regarded as lexical on top of which various languageto-language multilingual modules can be defined, where lexical correspondences are established by partly exploiting and partly enriching the monolingual descriptions. This architecture guarantees the independence of monolingual descriptions while allowing for the maximum degree of flexibility and consistency in reusing existing monolingual resources to build new bilingual lexicons. The MILE architecture is intended to provide the common representational environment needed to implement such an approach to multilingual resource development, with the goal of maximizing the reuse, integration and extension of existing monolingual computational lexicons. In the process of specifying the various components of MILE, the ISLE-CLWG has adopted a two-track strategy: 1) identifying the lexical dimensions and the various types of information which are relevant to establish multilingual correspondences; 2) idefining a suitable formal data model to encode this information as well as the operations required at the multilingual level. To tackle point 1) the survey of the available computational lexicons (see section 2.1) has been complemented with a more lexicographic-based effort, to identify the types of information used in bilingual dictionaries to establish translation equivalents. To this purpose, the CLWG has organized two “task forces” with the responsibility respectively of creating a sample of lexical entries and the use of the so-called traditional bilingual dictionaries. work on indicators been carried out mainly by S. Atkins and P. Bouillon: sense indicators are the ‘clues’ given by lexicographer to the bilingual dictionary users in order to guide them to the most appropriate choice of equivalence in the foreign language. The source word with its syntactic category, the target words and the sense indicators were automatically extracted from an English- French dictionary and then the sense indicators have been classified on the basis of lexical facts (cf. Atkins 2002). The aim of these activities has been twofold: on one hand, we wanted to be able to highlight the various types of information useful to determine the transfer conditions; on the other, we had to explore and evaluate the full expressive potentialities provided by the reference computational model (i.e. the PAROLE-SIMPLE architecture). 3.2 The MILE Data Structure and Lexicographic Environment The CLWG is setting up a lexicographic environment consisting of the following four components: i) the Entry the Lexical Data Categories, the Shared Lexical Objects, the Entry formalized as an XML DTD, is an Entity Relationship model that will define the general constraints for the construction of multilingual entries, as well as the grammar to build the whole array of lexical elements needed for a given lexical description. Lexical Data Categories provide the lexical objects (syntactic and semantic features, semantic relations, syntactic constructions, predicates and arguments etc..) that are the basic components of MILEconformant lexical entries. Lexical Data Categories will be organized in a hierarchy and will be defined using RDF schema (Brickley and Guha, 2000) to formalize their properties and make their “semantics” explicit. Shared Lexical Objects instantiate the MILE Lexical Data Categories, to be used to build in an easy and straightforward way lexical entries. These will include main syntactic constructions, basic operations and conditions to establish multilingual links, macro-semantic objects, such as lexical conceptual templates acting as general constraints for the encoding of semantic units. For instance, at the multilingual level it is possible to identify a first set of basic operations that are at the basis of multilingual transfer tests and actions. This would include: i) adding to a monolingual lexical entry a new syntactic position (required for a given translation correspondence); ii) adding to a monolingual semantic description a new semantic feature (required for a given translation correspondence); iii) constraining the source-target correspondence to apply only if an existing syntactic position is realized by a certain type of phrase, etc. Lexical objects will be identified by an URI and will act as a common resources for lexical representation, to be in turn described by RDF metadata. The defined lexical objects will be used by the lexicon (or applications) developers to build and target lexical data at a higher level of abstraction. Thus, they have to be seen as a step in the direction of simplifying and improving the usability of the MILE recommendations. The ISLE Lexicographic Station is a development platform used to automatically generate a prototype tool starting from the MILE DTD. The aim of this prototype tool is to i) exemplify the MILE entry ii) make extensive use of already existing monolingual resources, and iii) eventually test the guidelines in a real scenario. This situation led us to define a lexicographic station development platform that guarantees the portability of the final prototype to the final specifications as well as to existing monolingual resources which will serve as the basic data for MILE (for a detailed description, cf. Villegas and Bel, 2002). Both at monolingual and multilingual level (but with particular emphasis on the latter), ISLE intends to start up the incremental definition of a more Object-Oriented layer for lexical description and to foster the vision of open and distributed lexicons, with elements possibly residing in different sites of the web. 3 Enlargement to Asian Languages An enlargement of the group to involve also Asian languages is going on and representatives of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai languages have contributed to ISLE work and participated in some ISLE workshops. The cooperation between Asia and Europe has to be pursued also through new common initiatives, as the expression of interest for the of an Distributed Lexical has been submitted to the Commission for the Framework Programme for Research.</abstract>

The creation of such infrastructure has be in this regard needs the collaboration of a group of languages as large as possible (for example the AFNLPA brings into the initiative many Asian languages, such as Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Tamil, Thai and Urdu). A prerequisite in order to reach interoperability is the existence of best practices and standards that have been consensually agreed on or have been submitted to the international community 4 Conclusions In this paper we presented overall goals and methodological principles of standardization activity of EAGLES/ISLE. In particular, we describe the work of the Computational Lexicon Working Group and its effort towards recommendations, focussing on the MILE, the multilingual lexical meta-entry proposed as the standard representational format for multilingual computational lexical resources. Lexical representation is articulated over different information layers, each factoring out different, but possibly interrelated, linguistic facets of information, relevant in order to establish multilingual lexical links. We also pointed out the necessity to involve a broader group of languages in order to ensure the achievement of a real consensual standard.
