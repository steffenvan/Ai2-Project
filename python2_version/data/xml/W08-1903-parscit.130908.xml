In this paper we discuss the functional design of
an interface for a scholarly dictionary of contem-
porary standard Dutch which is currently being
compiled at the institute for Dutch Lexicology in
Leiden. The ‘Algemeen Nederlands Woorden-
boek’ (General Dutch Dictionary), further abbre-
viated as ANW, has been set up as an online dic-
tionary from the start. Thus, the ANW is not a
clone of an existing printed dictionary, but it
truly represents a new generation of electronic
dictionaries in the sector of academic and scien-
tific lexicography. A similar dictionary project is
undertaken for German at the Institut für
Deutsche Sprache in Mannheim, i.e. elexiko1.
The project runs from 2001 till 2019. We have
currently finished the functional design of the
interface and the first results will be published on
the web in 2009.

The structure of this paper is as follows. First
we will provide some background information on
the ANW dictionary and we will explain what a
semagram is. Then we will discuss the range of
search routes that are offered to the user to ex-
ploit the information in the dictionary and we
will describe the role of the semagram. The
ANW dictionary is aimed at the adult Dutch lan-
guage user ranging from laymen to linguists and
other language professionals.

2 The ANW dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952807692308">
The ANW Dictionary is a comprehensive online
scholarly dictionary of contemporary standard
Dutch in the Netherlands and in Flanders, the
Dutch speaking part of Belgium. Object of de-
scription is the general language. Thus words
that are specific to a particular region, to a par-
ticular group of people or a particular subject
field are not included. The dictionary focuses on
written Dutch and covers the period from 1970
till 2018. The ANW dictionary is a corpus-based
dictionary based on the ANW corpus, a balanced
corpus of just over 100 million words, which was
compiled specifically for the project at the Insti-
tute for Dutch Lexicology. The corpus was com-
pleted in 20052. It consists of several subcorpora:
a corpus of present-day literary texts, a corpus of
neologisms, a corpus of domain dependent texts
and a corpus of newspaper texts. The dictionary
will contain approximately 80.000 headwords
with a complete description and about 250.000
smaller entries.
The ANW is a very informative dictionary. Its
abstract entry structure is composed of hundreds
of elements and subelements. The reason for this
is that special attention is paid to words in con-
text (combinations, collocations, idioms, prov-

erbs) and to relations with other words (lexical
relations like synonymy, antonymy, hypero-
nymy, hyponymy), to semantic relations (meta-
phor, metonymy, generalisation, specialisation)
and to morphological patterns, the word structure
of derivations and compounds. One of its main
innovations is a twofold meaning description:
definitions are accompanied by ‘semagrams’. As
semagrams play a central role in the dictionary
(for understanding and production), we provide a
short introduction below.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.979478" genericHeader="method">
3 The semagram
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996792">
A semagram is the representation of knowledge
associated with a word in a frame of ‘slots’ and
‘fillers’. ‘Slots’ are conceptual structure elements
which characterise the properties and relations of
the semantic class of a word meaning. On the
basis of these slots specific data is stored (‘fill-
ers’) for the word in question. In ANW jargon
the abstract structure schema is called a ‘type
template’, whereas semagram refers to such a
‘type template’ populated with concrete word
data. Each semantic class has its own predefined
type template with its own slots. For instance, the
type template for the class of animals contains
the slots PARTS, BEHAVIOUR, COLOUR, SOUND,
BUILD, SIZE, PLACE, APPEARANCE, FUNCTION and
SEX, whereas the type template for beverages has
slots for INGREDIENT, PREPARATION, TASTE,
COLOUR, TRANSPARANCY, USE, SMELL, SOURCE,
FUNCTION, TEMPERATURE and COMPOSITION. So
far we have concentrated on semagrams for
nouns, those for verbs and adjectives will be dif-
ferent. Below we give an example of a semagram
for a member of the animal class, i.e. koe (cow)
(translated into English for illustration) in its
meaning as a ‘bovine’:

Example 1. Semagram for koe (cow)
At present the data in the slots is completed
manually by the lexicographers based on in-
formation in the ANW corpus, reference
works (such as dictionaries and encyclopaedia)
and their language and world knowledge. Not
all slots in the type template have to be com-
pleted in all cases. Only those for which there
is a value are shown in the above example. As
can be seen from the semagram above, the
lexicographers give the characterisation of the
slots in terms of short statements about the
headword. Such sentences are particularly well
suited to get an impression of the meaning
starting from the word form, i.e. for ‘semasi-

ological’ queries. To facilitate the retrieval for
queries from content or parts of the content to
the matching words, the ‘onomasiological que-
ries’, those sentences are complemented, after
a ‘#’ character (a hash), with one or more
keywords and possibly some synonyms or
other relevant words. The data after the hash
will not be visible to the dictionary user on the
screen though and will only be used in
searches by the computer to enhance retrieval.
A detailed description of the semagram, in-
cluding its origin, motivation and the devel-
opment of the type templates and their slots,
can be found in Moerdijk (2008). In this paper
we focus on the strategies that are available for
accessing information in the dictionary and we
discuss the role of the semagrams in this.
</bodyText>

4 Accessing the dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9960326">
As was hinted at in the previous section,
semagrams provide an increase and improve-
ment in search and query facilities. This is par-
ticularly the case for queries guiding the user
from content to form. For instance, a user who
cannot think of e.g. the word apiarist can find
this word through separate content elements
(e.g. ‘bees’, ‘keep’) that he does know and can
use for a search. However, with semagrams it
is not only possible to go from content to the
appropriate word. It is also possible to retrieve
a set of words on the basis of one or more con-
tent features. Thus a user can retrieve all
names for female animals in Dutch on the ba-
sis of a query combining the field CATEGORY
with the value ‘animal’, and a field SEX with
the value ‘female’. In our online dictionary we
wish to make all these possibilities available to
the user.
Five search options are distinguished:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9325309">
a) word → meaning, i.e. search for in-
formation about a word;
b) meaning → word, i.e. search for a
word starting from its meaning;
c) features → words, i.e. search for
words with one or more common fea-
tures;
d) search for example sentences;
e) search for other dictionary informa-
tion.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986245">
We believe that by presenting the search op-
tion this way (rather than using the traditional
dichotomy between simple search (a) and ad-
vanced search (b, c, d, e)), users have a better
overview of what they can actually search for
and will be more enticed to explore the various
options. Semagrams play a role in the first
three search options.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995905">
4.1 Word → Meaning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959341463415">
This is the traditional search which allows
the user to search for information about a word
or phrase in the dictionary. As this is the basic
search option, it is offered to the user in a cen-
tral place on every page of the interface. Some
form of fuzzy matching will be incorporated to
take care of typing errors and incomplete input.
The ANW contains a wealth of information.
To represent this to the user, we use a variation
of the two-panel selector model (Tidwell
2005), where two panes are shown next to
each other on the screen. (Figure 1)
The left pane contains a tree structure show-
ing all the elements available for the lemma in
question in the ANW. These tree structures
look like (and work as) Windows Explorer tree
structures. Advantage is that users know im-
mediately how to deal with them. Thus the
elements are hierarchically structured and can
be opened and closed like in Windows Ex-
plorer. The meaning structure (the numbered
elements in Figure 1) of the lemma remains
visible at all times. This way the user keeps an
overview and can select the information he
likes to see on the right-hand-side of the screen.
This is shown for the semagram of the first
meaning of koe (cow) in Figure 1. The ele-
ments are presented in the same order as in the
translated semagram in Example 1.3
On the article screen, the semagram is pre-
sented together with the definition. Its function
is to provide, in a systemized, explicit and
consistent way, more semantic and encyclope-
dic information than can be given in the defini-
tion. For the lemma koe (cow), for instance, it
gives the user information on sound, colour
and parts, which is not present in the definition.
At the bottom left of the screen, the user is
given a direct link to all idioms, proverbs, ex-
ample sentences and combinations for the
lemma koe (cow).

<bodyText confidence="0.999834818181818">
By this we mean the onomasiological search
where the user is looking for a word that he
has forgotten or where he wants to know
whether there is a word for a certain concept
or not. For instance, a user may want to know
whether there is a Dutch equivalent for the
English cradle snatcher (i.e. one who weds, or
is enamoured of, a much younger person
(OED)).
Onomasiological searches in electronic dic-
tionaries derived from printed dictionaries
have not been very successful so far, mostly
because such searches are primarily based on
definitions. Going from a definition to a word
can only succeed if the words of the user coin-
cide (more or less) with the words in the defi-
nition, which is seldom the case (Moerdijk
2002).
As also pointed out by Sierra (2000) the
ideal onomasiological search must allow writ-
ers to input the concept to be searched for
through the ideas they may have, using words
in any order. The system must be so con-
structed that it accepts a wide range of words
which it then analyses in order to point the
user to the word that most closely approaches
the concept he had in mind when he started the
search.
Recent work in computational linguistics
has therefore looked at the possibility of using
associative networks (Zock &amp; Bilac 2004) or a
combination of definitions and a resource such
as WordNet (El-Kahlout &amp; Oflazer 2004).
It is obvious that the information in the se-
magrams plays an essential role in the success
of onomasiological queries in the ANW. How-
ever, rather than just accepting a wide range of
words as input, we believe that the format in
which the input query is obtained can also help
to increase the success rate.
Therefore, we offer the user two alternatives
for onomasiological queries. First, the user can
search by giving a definition, a description, a
paraphrase or by summing up synonyms or
other words that he can associate with the
word he is looking for. This input will be sub-
ject to some linguistic analysis including
stemming and removal of stop words. Second,
there is a guided search based on the sema-
gram. The user is asked to choose a category
(the semantic class or subclass) from a menu
(is it a thing, a person, an animal, a vehicle,
etc.?). This is a subset of the total number of
semantic classes that are distinguished in the
ANW. Once the user has selected a category,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997932">
21
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99463532">
the feature slots of the type template for that
category appear on the screen and the user is
asked to fill in the value(s) that spring to mind.
Again we do not present the full list of feature
slots of the type template of that particular se-
mantic class, but rather a dozen or so (which
have been automatically deduced on the basis
of completed semagrams), as we do not want
to put off the user with excessively long lists
which he needs to complete before he gets an
answer. We illustrate this with an example for
animals.
Assume the user is looking for the name of
a particular breed of dogs, e.g. borzoi (barzoi
in Dutch), but cannot remember the word. In
order to find the answer, he selects the cate-
gory ‘animal’ from the menu. He is then pre-
sented with a list of features that are character-
istic for animals (Figure 2). He completes the
most prominent ones for the animal he is
thinking of e.g. BEHAVIOUR: quiet, intelligent
and independent; SOUND: barks; CLASS: grey-
hound; PLACE: Russia; SIZE: large; BUILD:
strong and graceful; APPEARANCE: long-haired;
MOVEMENT: sprinter.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999852285714286">
The input from the user is then compared to
the data in the dictionary database (semagrams,
definitions, lexical relations and ‘contex-
tants’4). Now the words behind the hashes are
also involved in the retrieval process and the
matching cases (in the best scenario just one!)
are shown. It is not necessary that the feature-

4 We define ‘contextants’ as words which do not
occur in direct combination with the headword, but
do occur in a wider context and are semantically
relevant for the headword. This is a separate infor-
mation category in the microstructure of the ANW.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994699">
value combinations match exactly one-to-one.
For instance, in our example, one of the values
given for BEHAVIOUR, i.e. intelligent, matches
the value for PROPERTY in the semagram for
barzoi (borzoi).
The results are then presented in a list, or-
dered by relevance. Each result is accompa-
nied by a ‘mini definition’5 such that the user
can immediately see which word (sense) he is
looking for.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989454">
4.3 Features → words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99097874">
This option is particularly relevant for linguists
and other language professionals. It enables
them to gather words that share one or more
identical features within the main dimensions
of the ANW, i.e. orthography, pronunciation,
morphology, pragmatics, meaning, combina-
torics, idioms, etymology. The semagram is of
course active in searches in the semantic do-
main. Its role is to some extent comparable to
its role in the search for a word, going from
content to form, but users can now search for
all the words that belong to a certain semantic
class, for all the words that share one or more
particular features, or for all the words sharing
both class and certain features, instead of
searching for a particular word to express a
concept. Here the user is presented the full list
of feature slots that occur in one or more of the
predefined type templates. This means a total
of nearly 200 features can be searched for.
To assist the user in finding his way through
this forest of criteria, they are presented in a
structured way much like the tree structure
which is used for navigation on the article
screen. We illustrate this with an example
query in Figure 3. The user starts from an
empty query screen. He is asked to select crite-
ria from the tree structure on the left. By de-
fault, the user searches for words, but he can
also search for proverbs or idioms which will
result in a different feature tree as only a sub-
set of the criteria that can occur in a query for
words apply to idioms and proverbs. In our
example the user wants to find all words for
long-haired animals (semagram) which consist
of two syllables and have alternating stress
(orthography and pronunciation). Again barzoi
(borzoi) will be among the results.
Figure 3 Screenshot Features → Words
This search option can also be used to resolve
the so-called tip-of-the-tongue problems where a
user is looking for a word which he cannot ac-
cess in his memory, but where he does know, for
instance, what the word looks like (e.g. its begin-
ning, number of syllables) and its part of speech.
For example, a user who is unsure whether the
particular breed of dogs he is looking for should
be called barzoi or borzoi in Dutch, can find the
answer by specifying that the form ends in –zoi,
the word consist of two syllables, that it is a noun
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992997">

<bodyText confidence="0.999929833333333">
and that it refers to a breed of dogs (animal cate-
gory) with long hairs (appearance).
Obviously users will be offered the possibility
to save their queries in a kind of ‘search tem-
plates’ to avoid having to reconstruct the same
query over and over again.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977232">
4.4 Search for examples
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951611111111">
This option allows the user to search for example
sentences based on a set of 5 criteria, i.e.
word(s), author, source, domain and date. For
instance, a user could search for all example sen-
tences with the words koe (cow) and schaap
(sheep) in the period from 2000 – 2002 (date).
No combo boxes are used for author and source.
Although we do not reckon that the user knows
which authors and sources are cited in the dic-
tionary, the lists would be excessively long and
we assume that the user will only use these crite-
ria in a search to see which other examples are
available from a particular author or source he
has retrieved in a previous query. Users will also
be offered the possibility to link through to more
examples of the same source or author by click-
ing on a particular source or author on the results
page.

4.5 Search for information about the ANW

<bodyText confidence="0.999961636363636">
The final search option groups primarily diction-
ary specific queries and queries of an administra-
tive nature, much like a Frequently Asked Ques-
tions page. Here the user will find queries about
frequency such as how many lemmas are dedi-
cated to lexicalised phrases? How many names
are there in the dictionary? How many nouns?
How many semagrams? How many Flemish
words? It also comprises questions such as what
kind of dictionary is the ANW? How big is the
ANW corpus? Which images are included?

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999379461538461">
In this paper we have discussed the functional
design of an interface for an electronic dictionary
of Dutch, the ANW. We have focused on the
access strategies that are offered and the role se-
magrams play in this. We have shown that sema-
grams provide an increase in search and query
facilities. One the one hand, they lead to a much
richer and more consistent semantic description
in ‘semasiological’ queries. On the other hand,
they are particularly well-suited to support
‘onomasiological’ queries by offering a struc-
tured way to find words through separate content
elements.
