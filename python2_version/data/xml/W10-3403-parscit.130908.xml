<bodyText confidence="0.999884625">
In this paper, we present an on-going
project aiming at extending the WordNet
lexical database by encoding common
sense featural knowledge elicited from
language speakers. Such extension of
WordNet is required in the framework of
the STaRS.sys project, which has the
goal of building tools for supporting the
speech therapist during the preparation of
exercises to be submitted to aphasic pa-
tients for rehabilitation purposes. We re-
view some preliminary results and illu-
strate what extensions of the existing
WordNet model are needed to accommo-
date for the encoding of commonsense
(featural) knowledge.

<bodyText confidence="0.999928125">
Electronic lexical resources such as WordNet
and FrameNet are used for a great variety of nat-
ural processing tasks, ranging from query expan-
sion, to word sense disambiguation, text classifi-
cation, or textual entailment. Some of these re-
sources are also used by human users as on-line
dictionaries; see the Princeton WordNet1 and the
MultiWordNet2 on-line sites. In this paper we
describe a novel attempt to exploit the informa-
tion contained in wordnets to build a tool de-
signed to support the therapy of language disord-
ers. In doing so, we will tackle also an interesting
theoretical issue. Is the WordNet conceptual
model apt to represent the common sense know-
ledge associated to concepts, which is partly lost
in case of language disorders (aphasia) due to a

brain damage? Note that, in cognitively oriented
studies of the lexicon such knowledge is often
represented in the form of featural descriptions
elicited from speakers, such as &lt;a cat&gt; is
lazy 3 , &lt;camels&gt; are found in deserts,
&lt;planes&gt; fly etc.
Anomia is the most pervasive and persistent of
aphasia symptoms. It has been described as “a
difficulty in finding high information words,
both in fluent discourse and when called upon to
identify an object of action by name” (Goodglass
and Wingfield, 1997:3). The naming difficulties
experienced by anomic patients can vary sub-
stantially, so that different “anomias” can be cha-
racterized as arising from either a mainly lexical
or mainly semantic breakdown. Depending on
the kind of anomia, therapeutic approaches can
vary, so as to employ the more appropriate tasks
and stimuli.
Computers can support the rehabilitation of
language disorders in many ways: from assisting
the administrative management to enhancing
common assessment methods, from helping the
clinician during the therapeutic session to alle-
viating the communicative difficulties of a pa-
tient by exploiting his unimpaired abilities (Pe-
theram, 2004).
In these pages we introduce STaRS.sys (Se-
mantic Task Rehabilitation Support system), a
Computer Assisted Therapy (CAT) tool designed
to support the therapist in the preparation of se-
mantic exercises such as odd-one-out, yes/no
attribute question answering, property generation
and so forth. All these exercises are based on the
kinds of information that are carried by featural

descriptions. Such a scenario motivates the need
for a lexical semantic resource which is richer
and somehow more cognitively-oriented than the
existing ones. We will argue that such needs can
be satisfied by enhancing the WordNet model
(WN: Fellbaum, 1998 ed) as implemented in the
Italian MultiWordNet (MWN: Pianta et al, 2002)
lexicon. Our project is developed in collabora-
tion with the CIMeC’s Center for Neuropsycho-
logical Rehabilitation (CeRiN), and focuses on
Italian. We leave to the future the evaluation of
whether and how our model can be expanded to
other languages.
These pages are organized as follows: Sec. 2
shows the possibilities offered by the exploita-
tion of STaRS.sys in a therapeutic context, and
the lexical semantics requirements that such use
poses. In Sec. 3 and 4 we illustrate specific is-
sues related to the encoding of featural know-
ledge into the MWN model.

2.1 Semantic requirements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999704886363636">
An essential requirement of the STaRS.sys tool
is the capability of managing the major variables
that influence the performance of anomic pa-
tients in semantic therapeutic tasks (Raymer and
Gonzalez-Rothi, 2002; Cree and McRae, 2003).
Accordingly, we identified a minimum of five
types of information which should be available
for every lexical concept:
Conceptual Taxonomy. A fully-specified
conceptual taxonomy is an essential requirement
for our tool, in the light of the existence of pa-
tients affected by language disorders specific to
certain semantic categories, such as tools, or liv-
ing beings (Capitani et al, 2003).
Featural Descriptions. Featural descriptions
are assumed to play a central role in the human
semantic memory (Murphy, 2002) and will be
represented here as &lt;concept&gt; feature
couples, e.g. &lt;dog&gt; has a tail.
This information can be exploited for selecting
sets of concepts which are relevant in a certain
therapeutic context, e.g. concepts sharing a fea-
ture value (“red objects”) or those for which a
type of feature is particularly relevant (e.g. “ani-
mals with a peculiar fur”).
Feature Types Classification. A grouping of
FDs into feature types is needed for selectively
working on feature types of interest, or for the
estimation of semantic measures such as feature
distinctiveness, semantic relevance, concept si-
milarity and feature correlation (Cree and
McRae, 2003; Sartori and Lombardi, 2004; Vin-
son et al, 2003). As we will see in the following
sections, feature types can be mapped onto
WordNet-like relations.
Prototypicality. A concept can be more or
less representative of its category. Choosing and
working on concepts with different levels of pro-
totypicality can be informative, for both thera-
peutic and diagnostic purposes.
Word Frequency. Patients’ performance can
be affected by word frequency. Thereby, a criti-
cal skill for our tool is the ability to discriminate
between words used with different frequencies.

2.2 Use Case Scenarios
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993398">
By exploiting a lexical infrastructure encoding
such semantic information, STaRS.sys can be
used by a therapist for:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999930333333333">
• retrieving concepts;
• retrieving information associated to concepts;
• comparing concepts.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919142857143">
These three functionalities can be illustrated
by the preparation of three different tasks for a
patient affected by, e.g., a semantic deficit selec-
tively affecting animal concepts. Such a kind of
patient would show comprehension and produc-
tion difficulties restricted to concepts belonging
to the animal category (Capitani et al, 2003).
Plausibly, furthermore, his production problems
would manifest both as naming failure in con-
trolled conditions (i.e. in tests like the ones re-
ported below) and as a difficulty/inability to re-
trieve the intended word in spontaneous speech
(Semenza, 1999).
In the first scenario, the therapist looks for
concepts that match given specifications in order
to prepare a feature generation task. As an exam-
ple, she submits to STaRS.sys a request for con-
cepts of frequent use, referring to animals, asso-
ciated to highly distinctive color features and
having a high mean feature distinctiveness. The
system returns concepts such as zebra, tiger
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994506">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972695652174">
and cow. Finally the patient is asked to generate
phrasal descriptions for these concepts.
In a second scenario, STaRS.sys is used to re-
trieve FDs for a given set of concepts. Right and
wrong concept-feature couples are created to
build a questionnaire, in which the patient is re-
quired to distinguish the right from the wrong
pairs. For instance, the therapist submits to
STaRS.sys a query for features of the concept
leopard that are highly relevant and either per-
ceptual or taxonomical, and obtains features such
as is yellow with black spots and is a
cat.
Finally, in the third scenario the therapist uses
STaRS.sys to find concepts for an odd-one-out
task. That is, she looks for triples composed of
two similar concepts plus an incoherent one that
has to be found by the patient. As an example,
starting from the concept lion, she looks for
animals that typically live in a similar/different
natural habitat, and obtains similar concepts such
as leopard and cheetah, and a dissimilar con-
cept such as wolf.

3 WN as semantic lexical resource for
STaRS.sys
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995575">
The STaRS.sys application scenario motivates
the need for a lexical semantic resources that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.628892333333333">
R1: is cognitively motivated;
R2: is based on a fully-specified is-a hierarchy;
R3: is intuitive enough to be used by a therapist;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988160795454546">
R4: allows for the encoding of featural properties
and their association to concepts;
While designing the STaRS.sys tool, we made
the hypothesis that a semantic lexical resource
built according to the WN model could meet
most of the above requirements.
In the WN model every concept is represented
as a synset (set of synonyms) such as {hand, ma-
nus, hook, mauler, mitt, paw}. Such semantic
units are organized in a network interconnected
trough several relations. Examples of semantic
relations include the is-a relation, e.g.{left_hand,
left} is-a {hand, ...}, and the meronymy relation,
e.g. {hand, ...} has-part {finger}.
At a first glance, WN seems to easily meet
three of the above criteria. First, WN was initial-
ly conceived as a model of the human lexical
memory. Second, WordNet implement extensive
and systematic noun hierarchies. More specifi-
cally, a preliminary analysis of the Italian MWN
nominal hierarchy has shown that the semantic
categories which are relevant for rehabilitation
purposes can be easily mapped onto MWN top
level nodes (tools, animals, people). Third, WN
is based on a conceptual model which is relative-
ly simple and near to language use (as opposed
to more sophisticated logics-based models). We
expect that this feature will facilitate the use of
STaRS.sys by therapists, which may not have all
the formal logics awareness that is needed to use
formal ontologies. Furthermore, MWN is ma-
nually developed trough an on-line Web applica-
tion. We expect that such application can be used
by therapists using STaRS.sys for the shared and
community-based development/maintenance of
the lexical resource they need.
A final motivation in favor of the choice of
MWN is the fact that this Italian resource is
strictly aligned at the semantic level to English
and other European languages (e.g. Spanish, Por-
tuguese, Romania, Hebrew). Thus, we can envi-
sage that at least part of the semantic information
which is encoded for Italian can be ported to the
aligned languages and used for similar purposes.

4 Mapping featural descriptions into
MWN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997775">
Our hypothesis about the usefulness of the WN
model for the needs of STaRS.sys can be fully
confirmed only if we find a way to encode in
such a model all or most of the knowledge which
is contained in feature descriptions elicited from
Italian speakers (R4 in previous section). In more
general terms we need to answer the following
questions. Does MWN already contain all the
information that is needed by the STaRS.sys re-
quirements? If we need to extend the existing
MWN, can we simply add new synsets and in-
stances of existing relations, or do we need to
add new relation types? Is the conceptual model
of MWN or of any other WN variant powerful
enough to encode all the information contained
in feature descriptions?
A first simple approach to representing fea-
ture descriptions in MWN is associating feature
descriptions to synset glosses. As a consequence,
a MWN gloss, which is currently composed of a
definition and a list of usage examples, all
crafted by lexicographers, would contain also a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995505">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999664428571429">
list of feature descriptions, elicited from lan-
guage speakers.
This approach may be useful for some of the
foreseen usages of STaRS.sys (e.g. retrieving
feature descriptions from concepts), and can also
be interesting for a generic use of MWN. How-
ever, to fully exploit the knowledge contained in
FDs (e.g. for calculating concept similarity) it is
necessary to encode that knowledge in a more
explicit way; that is we need to map each FD in a
wordnet-like relation between a source and a
target concept. For instance, a pair such as &lt;cup&gt;
is used for drinking can be represented as a
is_used_for relation holding between the source
concept {cup} and the target concept {drink}.
Encoding the source concept is relatively easy
given that it is usually expressed as an isolated
word that is used as stimulus for feature elicita-
tion from subjects, e.g. “scimmia” (“monkey”).
The only problematic aspect in this step may be
the choice of the right sense which was meant
when the word has been proposed to subjects. In
some cases this may be not trivial, even if, in
principle, stimulus words are supposed to be
chosen so as to avoid ambiguities; see for in-
stance the word “cipolla” (“onion”), which in
MWN is ambiguous between the vegetable and
food sense.
More complex is the encoding of the feature
itself which is a free and possibly complex lin-
guistic description (e.g. likes eating bana-
nas). To fulfill our goal, we need to map such
description in a wordnet-like relation and a target
concept. Such goal can be accomplished in two
steps.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9580905">
4.1 Mapping feature types into MWN rela-
tions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964690625">
Given the semantic requirements illustrated in
Sec. 2.1, one the first steps in the development of
the STaRS.sys tool has been the design of a clas-
sification of FDs in feature types; see Lebani and
Pianta (2010). In a second moment, we realized
that assigning a FD to a feature type is equivalent
to assigning it to a wordnet relation, given that it
is possible to create one-to-one mappings be-
tween features types and relations.
The adopted feature type classification has
been designed so as to be (1) reasonably intui-
tive, (2) robust and (3) cognitively plausible. The
cognitive plausibility requirement has been ful-
filled by moving from an analysis of similar pro-
posals put forwards in the experimental litera-
ture, or exploited in the therapeutic practice. As
for the former, we considered research fields as
distant as lexicography, theoretical linguistics
and cognitive psychology. Examples of compati-
ble proposals currently exploited in the therapeu-
tic practice are the question type of Laiacona et
al’s (1993) semantic questionnaire, a type classi-
fication adopted by the therapists of the CIMeC’s
CeRiN (personal communication) and the Se-
mantic Feature Analysis paradigm (Boyle and
Coelho, 1995).
The resulting classification only considers
concrete objects and is composed of 25 feature
types. All of them (except the is associated with
relations) belong to one of the following six rela-
tions) belong to one of the following six major
classes: taxonomic properties, part-of- relations,

perceptual properties, usage properties, location-
al properties and associated events and attributes.
A first version of this classification has been
evaluated by asking 5 naïve Italian speakers to
assign the appropriate type label to 300 concept4-
feature pairs from a non-normalized version of
the Kremer et al’s (2008) norms. The inter-coder
agreement between subjects (Fleiss’ Multi-π =
0,73) validated the skeleton of our classification,
at the same time suggesting some minor changes
that have been applied to the classification pro-
posed here. An evaluation of the improved clas-
sification involving therapists has been planned
for the (very near) future.
Note that in order to map all of the feature
types into wordnet relations we had to create a
number of new relations which are not available
in existing wordnets. The list of existing MWN
relations used to encode STaRS.sys feature types
includes five items: hypernym, has_co-ordinate,
has_part, has_member, has_substance. The fol-
lowing table contains the list of the 20 additional
relations, along with examples.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998929">
4.2 Encoding target concepts in MWN
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988523029850747">
A second step needed in order to fully represent
the semantics of feature descriptions in MWN is
the encoding of target concepts.
Target concepts can be expressed by a noun
(e.g. has a &lt;neck&gt;), an adjective (e.g. is &lt;big&gt;)
or a verb or a verbal construction (e.g. is used
for &lt;drinking&gt;, is used to &lt;cut bread&gt;).
In principle this is not problematic as WN en-
codes all these lexical categories.
What is problematic instead is the possible
complexity of target concepts. Whereas in WN
synsets are bound to contain only lexical units
(with the few exceptions of the so called artificial
nodes), the target of a featural description can be
a free combination of words, for instance a noun
modified by an adjective (e.g. has a &lt;long
neck&gt;), an adjective modified by an adverb (e.g.
is &lt;very big&gt;) or a verb with an argument (e.g.
is used to &lt;cut bread&gt;). For giving an idea of
the phenomenon, consider that 27,6% of the fea-
tures that composes the experimental sample in
4 In details, the subjects were submitted with concrete con-
cepts belonging to one of the following categories: mam-
mals, birds, fruits, vegetables, body parts, clothing, mani-
pulable tools, vehicles, furniture and buildings.
Lebani and Pianta (2010) contain target concepts
expressed by free combination of words
The solution we adopted to solve this problem
relies on the notion of phraset proposed by Ben-
tivogli and Pianta (2003; 2004), that is a data
structure used for encoding “sets of synonymous
free combination of words (as opposed to lexical
units) which are recurrently used to express a
concept”. In the original proposal, the authors
introduced such a data structure to cope with
lexical gaps in multingual resources or to encode
alternative (linguistically complex) ways of ex-
pressing an existing concept. Phrasets can be as-
sociated to existing synsets to represent alterna-
tive (non lexical) ways of expressing lexicalized
concepts, e.g. the Italian translations of “dish-
cloth”:
Synset: {canovaccio, strofinaccio}
Phraset: {strofinaccio_per_i_piatti,
straccio_per_i_piatti}
where “strofinaccio per i piatti” and “straccio per
i piatti” and are free combinations of words. In
alternative, they can be used to represent lexical
gaps, such as the Italian translation equivalent of
“breadknife”:
Synset: {GAP}
Phraset: {coltello_da_pane,
coltello_per_il_pane}
Phrasets can be annotated by exploiting the com-
poses/composed-of lexical relation linking phra-
set with the synsets corresponding to the con-
cepts that compose it. For instance the expression
in the above phraset is linked by a hypernym and
by a composed-of relation with the synset {col-
tello} (knife) and {pane} (bread). As far as
FDs are concerned, the use of phrasets is com-
patible with the received view about the compo-
sitional nature of the human conceptual know-
ledge (Murphy, 2002).
Figure 1 shows how phrasets allow for
representing the complex FD &lt;breadknife&gt; is
used to cut bread in the MWN model.

aspect for the use of wordnet-like resources in
such a context is the possibility of representing
lexical knowledge represented in the form of fea-
ture descriptions elicited from language speakers.
Our work has illustrated the steps which are
needed to encode feature descriptions in the WN
model. To this purpose we introduced twenty
new wordnet relations, and relied on phrasets for
representing complex (non-lexicalized) concepts.
The study presented in these pages is a neces-
sary theoretical step for the development of our
tool. A practical evaluation of its feasibility is
planned for the very near future, together with
other (equally important but less relevant in this
context) issues concerning both the population of
our semantic knowledge base and the overall
design of STaRS.sys.

<abstract confidence="0.997728470588235">In this paper, we present an on-going project aiming at extending the WordNet lexical database by encoding common sense featural knowledge elicited from language speakers. Such extension of WordNet is required in the framework of the STaRS.sys project, which has the goal of building tools for supporting the speech therapist during the preparation of exercises to be submitted to aphasic patients for rehabilitation purposes. We review some preliminary results and illustrate what extensions of the existing WordNet model are needed to accommodate for the encoding of commonsense (featural) knowledge.</abstract>

These three functionalities can be illustrated by the preparation of three different tasks for a patient affected by, e.g., a semantic deficit selectively affecting animal concepts. Such a kind of patient would show comprehension and production difficulties restricted to concepts belonging to the animal category (Capitani et al, 2003). Plausibly, furthermore, his production problems would manifest both as naming failure in controlled conditions (i.e. in tests like the ones reported below) and as a difficulty/inability to retrieve the intended word in spontaneous speech (Semenza, 1999). In the first scenario, the therapist looks for concepts that match given specifications in order to prepare a feature generation task. As an example, she submits to STaRS.sys a request for concepts of frequent use, referring to animals, associated to highly distinctive color features and having a high mean feature distinctiveness.

It has been described as “a difficulty in finding high information words, both in fluent discourse and when called upon to identify an object of action by name” (Goodglass and Wingfield, 1997:3). The naming difficulties experienced by anomic patients can vary substantially, so that different “anomias” can be characterized as arising from either a mainly lexical or mainly semantic breakdown. Depending on the kind of anomia, therapeutic approaches can vary, so as to employ the more appropriate tasks and stimuli.

More complex is the encoding of the feature itself which is a free and possibly complex linguistic description (e.g. likes eating bananas). To fulfill our goal, we need to map such description in a wordnet-like relation and a target concept. Such goal can be accomplished in two steps. 4.1 Mapping feature types into MWN relations Given the semantic requirements illustrated in Sec. 2.1, one the first steps in the development of the STaRS.sys tool has been the design of a classification of FDs in feature types; see Lebani and Pianta (2010). In a second moment, we realized that assigning a FD to a feature type is equivalent to assigning it to a wordnet relation, given that it is possible to create one-to-one mappings between features types and relations. The adopted feature type classification has been designed so as to be (1) reasonably intuitive, (2) robust and (3) cognitively plausible. The cognitive plausibility requirement has been fulfilled by moving from an analysis of similar proposals put forwards in the experimental literature, or exploited in the therapeutic practice. As for the former, we considered research fields a</context>

These three functionalities can be illustrated by the preparation of three different tasks for a patient affected by, e.g., a semantic deficit selectively affecting animal concepts. Such a kind of patient would show comprehension and production difficulties restricted to concepts belonging to the animal category (Capitani et al, 2003). Plausibly, furthermore, his production problems would manifest both as naming failure in controlled conditions (i.e. in tests like the ones reported below) and as a difficulty/inability to retrieve the intended word in spontaneous speech (Semenza, 1999). In the first scenario, the therapist looks for concepts that match given specifications in order to prepare a feature generation task. As an example, she submits to STaRS.sys a request for concepts of frequent use, referring to animals, associated to highly distinctive color features and having a high mean feature distinctiveness. The system returns concepts such as zebra, tiger 13 and cow. Finally the patient is asked to generate phrasal descriptions for these concepts. In a second scenario, STaRS.sys is used to retrieve FDs for a given set of concepts. Right and wrong concept-feature coupl</context>

This information can be exploited for selecting sets of concepts which are relevant in a certain therapeutic context, e.g. concepts sharing a feature value (“red objects”) or those for which a type of feature is particularly relevant (e.g. “animals with a peculiar fur”). Feature Types Classification. A grouping of FDs into feature types is needed for selectively working on feature types of interest, or for the estimation of semantic measures such as feature distinctiveness, semantic relevance, concept similarity and feature correlation (Cree and McRae, 2003; Sartori and Lombardi, 2004; Vinson et al, 2003). As we will see in the following sections, feature types can be mapped onto WordNet-like relations. Prototypicality. A concept can be more or less representative of its category. Choosing and working on concepts with different levels of prototypicality can be informative, for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Word Frequency. Patients’ performance can be affected by word frequency. Thereby, a critical skill for our tool is the ability to discriminate between words used with different frequencies. 2.2 Use Case Scenarios By exploiting a lexical infrastructure encoding such semantic infor</context>
