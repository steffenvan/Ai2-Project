1. Build the forward and backward BSTs.
2. Traverse each BST and extract left
and right alignments for every node
that represents a divergence
For each word pair from the divergence set:
a. create context alignments out of
appropriate left and right alignments
b. filter out invalid context alignments
c. extract valid translation candidates
from the context alignments

words 50.000 sentences for each language.
We obtained it by taking two non-parallel, non-
aligned segments from the Hansard corpus. We
also used GIZA1 to automatically build a small
bilingual lexicon of 6.900 entries using 5.000 sen-
tences pairs (150.000 words for each language).
The parallel corpus was taken from the Proceed-
ings of the European Parliament (EuroParl).
Note that the parallel corpus belongs to a differ-
ent domain than the comparable corpus. Also,
the parallel corpus is extremely small. For low-
density languages, such a corpus can be built
manually.
When given as input the comparable corpus
described above and the bilingual lexicon of
6.900 entries, the algorithm described in Section
3 found 33.926 parallel sequences, with lengths
between 3 and 7 words (we do not report here
aligned sequences of less than 3 words). Out
of 100 randomly selected sequences, 95% were
judged to be correct. Some examples of the dis-
covered alignments are shown in Figure 8.
The system also found translations for 30
unknown French words. Of these, 9 are cor-
rect, which means a precision of 30%. Figure 9
shows some proposed translations and the con-
text alignments on which they are based.
For each of the two corpora, building the
monolingual GST took only 1.5 minutes. The
matching operation that yields the BST is the
most time-consuming it lasted 38 hours for the
forward BST and 60 hours for the reverse BST.
The extractions of all parallel phrases and of
the translations took about 2 hours each. We
ran the experiments on a Linux system with a
Pentium 3 processor of 866Mhz.

<bodyText confidence="0.974842956521739">
GST and BST construction
The most important limitation of our method
is that it can find and exploit only word align-
ments that are monotonic. This makes the
system applicable primarily on language pairs
which have similar word order, such as English-
French and English-Chinese.
A second, less severe limitation concerns the
scalability of the algorithms The GST and BST
derivation algorithms that we implemented to
date are not the most efficient. For example,
Kurtz (1999) shows how to reduce space require-
ments of suffix trees. And Farach (1997) and
Andersson et al. (1999) present construction
algorithms which, for trees defined over large al-
phabets such as words, are more efficient than
Ukkonen&apos;s algorithm (which we used in our im-
plementation). The matching operation can be
parallelized with linear speedup, since match-
ing of a pair of branches is independent of the
matching of any other pair. We plan to incor-
porate these improvements in future versions of
our system.

Learning new translations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983125">
The translation precision that we obtained
is lower than that reported in previous ap-
proaches. However, we attempted to solve a
much harder problem: our algorithm does not
take as input the list of unknown words, but
learns automatically from the corpus both the
unknown words and their translations. There-
fore our results depend both on the degree of
parallelism of the two corpora, and on their size.
We expect that as we scale the algorithm to pro-
cess corpora of billions of words, our precision
will improve.
As mentioned in section 4, our algorithm for
learning new translations yields many context
alignments, most of them corresponding to in-
correct translations. Filtering out these incor-
rect translations is an important part of the al-
gorithm. Our current filtering method, which is
based on the length and content of the context
alignment, is rather simple. The co-occurence
methods used in the previous approaches could
be of help here, by providing additional sources
of evidence about the translations defined by
our context alignments.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.72377">
Bootstrapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939769230769">
It is clear that our algorithm can bootstrap it-
self using the learned word translations. The
additional word alignments could allow us to
find more and longer parallel sequences, and
thus better context alignments out of which will
come yet more new translations. At the time of
submission we have not yet implemented this
bootstrapping procedure.
In general, we find BSTs to be an extremely
useful data structure that we believe will be of
great use to other natural language researchers
interested in aligning sequences defined over dif-
ferent alphabets.

This makes the system applicable primarily on language pairs which have similar word order, such as EnglishFrench and English-Chinese. A second, less severe limitation concerns the scalability of the algorithms The GST and BST derivation algorithms that we implemented to date are not the most efficient. For example, Kurtz (1999) shows how to reduce space requirements of suffix trees. And Farach (1997) and Andersson et al. (1999) present construction algorithms which, for trees defined over large alphabets such as words, are more efficient than Ukkonen&apos;s algorithm (which we used in our implementation). The matching operation can be parallelized with linear speedup, since matching of a pair of branches is independent of the matching of any other pair. We plan to incorporate these improvements in future versions of our system. Learning new translations The translation precision that we obtained is lower than that report</context>
