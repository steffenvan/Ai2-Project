Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892933333333">
We report that a proper employment of MWEs
concerned enables us to put forth a tractable
framework, which is based on a multiple
nesting of semantic operations, for the
processing of non-inferential, Non-
propositional Contents (NPCs) of natural
Japanese sentences. Our framework is
characterized by its broad syntactic and
semantic coverage, enabling us to deal with
multiply composite modalities and their
semantic/pragmatic similarity. Also, the
relationship between indirect (Searle, 1975)
and direct speech, and equations peculiar to
modal logic and its family (Mally, 1926; Prior,
1967) are treated in the similarity paradigm.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986283333333">
While proper treatment of the Propositional
Content (PC) of a sentence is undoubtedly
important in natural language processing (NLP),
the Non-propositional Content (NPC) also plays a
critical role in tasks such as discourse
understanding, dialogue modeling, detecting
speaker’s intension. We refer generically to the
information which is provided by auxiliaries,
adverbs, sentence-final particles or specific
predicative forms in Japanese sentences as NPC. It
is concerned with notions such as polarity, tense,
aspect, voice, modality, and illocutionary act,
which incorporate temporal, contingent, subjective,
epistemic or attitudinal information into the PC.
Though the inferential NPC e.g., implicature
(Grice, 1975), has been discussed in semantics or
pragmatics, it lies beyond the state-of-the-art
technology of NLP. Besides, no systematic attempt
to connect linguistic forms in the sentence with the
non-inferential NPCs has been reported in NLP
community. In this paper, we present a framework
for the treatment of NPC of a sentence on the basis
of the extensive, proper employment of multiword
expressions (MWEs) indicating the NPCs in
Japanese. In Japanese, which is a so-called SOV
language, NPCs are typically indicated in the V-
final position by auxiliaries, particles and their
various alternative multiword expressions. We
have extracted extensively these expressions from
large-scale Japanese linguistic data. We refer to
these, including auxiliaries and ending-particles, as
NPC indicators (NPCIs). The number of NPCIs
amounts to 1,500, whereas that of auxiliaries and
ending-particles is about 50, which is apparently
insufficient for practical NLP tasks.
Our model leads to dealing not only with some of
illocutionary acts (Austin, 1962) but also with the
logical operations peculiar to the family of modal
logic, i.e., deontic (Mally, 1926) and temporal
logic (Prior, 1967).
We also present, in this paper, the idea of the
similarity among NPCs within our framework.
This is essential for text retrieval, paraphrasing,
document summarization, example-based MT, etc.
Some of the indirect speech acts (Searle, 1975) and
axioms proper to the family of modal logic are
treated formally in the similarity paradigm.
In Section 2, we introduce an overview of our
ongoing MWE resource development for general
Japanese language processing. In Section 3, we
introduce a framework for the treatment of NPC. A
set of primitive functions to compose NPC is
explained in Section 4. In Section 5, first, the
relationship between the framework and Japanese
syntax, and second, methods to identify NPCs of
Japanese sentences and to apply them to a
translation task are described. In Section 6, we
formalize the similarity among NPCs within the
framework. In Section 7, we present conclusions
and comment on future work.

2 Background MWE Resources
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997124090909091">
The authors have been concerned with how to
select atomic expressions of the sentence
construction in NLP based on the semantic
compositionality. Morphosyntactically, this
problem is also serious for the processing of the
agglutinative, space-free language like Japanese.
Our research on this subject started in ‘70s by
extracting manually multiword expressions as
MWEs from large-scale Japanese linguistic data in
the general domain. We estimate that the amount of
data examined is 200,000 sentences.

<bodyText confidence="0.9675106">
In this Section, we present an overview of our
ongoing development of Japanese MWE resources.
We have extracted multiword expressions that take
at least one of the following three features;
f1: idiomaticity (semantic non-decomposability),
f2: lexical rigidity (non-separability),
f3: statistical boundness.
The expression which causes the difficulty in
composing its overall meaning from normal
meanings of component words has f1.1 f2 includes
the feature to allow other words to cut in between
the component words. The expression whose
components are bound each other with high
conditional probability has f3. Each multiword
expression selected as a MWE was endowed with a
binary-valued basic triplet (f1, f2, f3). For example,
an idiomatic, separable and not-statistically-bound
expression, “ · · hone·wo·oru” ‘make an
effort (lit. break bone)’ is endowed with (1,0,0) and
compositional, separable and statistically-bound
expression, “ · gussuri·nemuru”
‘sleep soundly’, with (0,0,1). A dot ‘·’ denotes a
conventional word-boundary, hereafter.
Fixed expressions, decomposable idioms,
institutionalized phrases, syntactically-idiomatic
phrases, light verb constructions discussed in (Sag
et al., 2002) and proverbs might correspond
roughly to the triplets, (1,1,0), (1,0,0), (0,0,1),
(0,x,1), (0,x,1) and (1,1,1), respectively.
MWEs, whose number amounts to 64,800 at
present, are classified by their overall, grammatical
functions as follows. Examples with a triplet and
the current number of expressions are also given in
the following. Compound nouns and proper nouns
are excluded in the present study.

Nominals listed above are those marked with a
triplet (1,1,x). We exclude compound nouns with
(0,0,x) and proper nouns, whose number amounts
to quite large, in this study. They should be treated
in some other way in NLP. A treatment of those
compound nouns for Japanese language processing
is reported in (Miyazaki et al., 1993).
Formally, the triplet is expanded in the lexicon to a
partly multi-valued 7-tuple (f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7).
The augmented features are as follows;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.882648153846154">
f4: grammatical class (shown above)
f5: syntactical, original internal-structure
f6: morphosyntactical variation: (m1, m2, ... , m9)
m1: possibility to be modified by adnominal
m2: possibility to be modified by appredicative
m3: auxiliaries insertable in between its words
m4: particles insertable in between its words
m5: deletable particles
m6: particles by which those in it are replaced
m7: constituents which can be reordered
m8: possibility to be nominalized by inversion
m9: possibility to be passivized
f7: estimated relative frequency
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998828636363637">
f6 was adopted to ensure the flexibility of MWEs,
while controlling the number of headings.
Thus, our lexicon is not simply a list of MWEs but
designed as a resource proliferous to a total variety
of idiosyncratic expressions. (Shudo et al., 1980,
1988; Shudo, 1989; Yasutake et al., 1997).
The present study focuses on a set of NPCIs and its
relationship to the non-propositional structure of
natural sentences. Some of our multiword NPCIs
are treated in the general, rewriting framework for
MT in (Shirai et al., 1993).

3 Non-propositional Structures (NPSs)
Let us consider the meaning of a sentence;
(1) “ ·· · · · · ·
kare·ha·soko·ni·iru·bekide·nakat·ta” ‘He should
not have been there’,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989515">
where a verb “ iru” ‘be’ is followed by
three auxiliaries, “ bekida” ‘should’, “
nai” ‘not’ and “ ta” ‘-ed’ which mean
obligation, negation and past-tense, respectively, in
the sentence-final position 2 . According to the
occurrences of them, the solely literal paraphrase
of (1) would be something like;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99847675">
(2) “ · · · · · · · · · ·
·
kare·ha·soko·ni·iru·bekida·to·iu·koto·ha·nakat·ta
” ‘It was not necessary for him to be there’,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.976347">
However, this reading is not correct for (1). Rather,
in contrast, its regular reading should be something
like;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.95211">
(3) “ ·· · · · · · ·
kare·ga·soko·ni·i·ta·no·ha·mazui” ‘It is evaluated
in the negative that he was there’,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.944786">
By the way, it will be reasonable to think sentences
2 “ bekida” and “ nai ” are inflected as “ bekide” and “
nakat”, respectively, in (1).
(2) and (3) share a kernel sentence “ · · ·
· kare·ga·soko·ni·iru” ‘He is there’, into
which NPCs are incorporated successively, i.e.,
first - obligation, second - negation, third - past-
tense, in the case of (2), and first - past-tense,
second - speaker’s-negative-evaluation, in the case
of (3). Moreover, each stage of this incorporation
would be regarded as mapping the utterance’s
meaning from one to another, in parallel with a
syntactic form being mapped from one to another.
Hence, by introducing Non-propositional Primitive
Functions (NPFs), e.g., OBLIGATION2,
NEGATION1, PAST-TENSE, and NEG-EVAL, we
can explain the Non-propositional Structure (NPS)
of (2) as;
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996926333333333">
(4)PAST-TENSE [NEGATION1
[OBLIGATION2[“ · · · ·
kare·ga·soko·ni·iru” ‘He is there’] ] ]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.902101">
and NPS of (3), hence, of (1) as,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.90585">
(5)NEG-EVAL[PAST-TENSE[“ · · · ·
kare·ga·soko·ni·iru” ‘He is there’] ].3
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905647058823">
Here, a problem is that (4) is wrong for (1). In
order to cope with this, while adopting a MWE,
“ · ·bekide·nakat·ta” as a NPCI
with a triplet (1,0,0) which has a composite NPF,
NEG-EVAL[PAST-TENSE[x]]4, we have designed
our segmenter to prefer a longer segment by the
least-cost evaluation.
It should be noted that a composite of NPFs like
this could be associated with a single NPCI. 5 This
is caused by its idiomaticity, i.e., by the difficulty
in decomposing it into semantically consistent sub-
forms.
Investigating a reasonably sized set of Japanese
linguistic data, keeping the strategy exemplified
above in mind, revealed that NPS of a natural
Japanese sentence can be generally formulated as a
nested functional form;
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.497597">
(6) Mn[Mn-1...[M2[M1[S]]]...],
where S is a propositional, kernel sentence; Mi
(1 i n), a NPF. In the following, we use the
</equation>
<footnote confidence="0.9144669">
3 We use lower-suffixes to distinguish NPFs by the subtle differences in
meaning, degree, etc.
4 Another choice could be, first, to adopt a shorter MWE, “ · bekide·
nai” ‘should not’ as a NPCI indicating PROHIBITION2, second, to build a NPS,
PAST-TENSE[PROHIBITION2[“ · · · · kare·ga·soko·ni·iru” ‘He
is there’]], and last, to apply the following similarity rule in order to obtain (5),
unless it yields the overgeneralization;
PAST-TENSE[PROHIBITION2[x]] NEG-EVAL[PAST-TENSE[x]].
The similarity rules are discussed in Section 6.
5 Another typical example is“ mai” which is a single auxiliary but has the
</footnote>
<table confidence="0.5369772">
meaning of ‘will not’, i.e., GUESS2[NEGATION1[x]].
notation for a composite function,
Mn◦Mn-1...◦M2◦M1, where Mn◦Mn-1...◦M2◦M1[S] =
Mn[Mn-1...[M2[M1[S]]]...].
4 NPCIs, NPFs

<tableCaption confidence="0.563252857142857">
We have settled a set of 150 basic NPFs by
classifying 1,500 NPCIs which had been extracted
from the large-scale data. After manually
extracting them, the data has been continuously
checked and updated by comparing with various
dictionaries and linguistic literature such as
(Morita et al.,1989).
They are subclassified as follows, though the
boundaries between subclasses are partly subtle. It
should be noted that some NPCIs are semantically
ambiguous, being included in different subclasses

5.1 Sentence-final Structure in Japanese

Employing MWEs as NPCIs enabled us to
describe the outermost structure of a Japanese
sentence by the following production rules;

<listItem confidence="0.5316795">
(7) S0→BP*·PRED,
(8) Si→Si-1·mi, (1 i n),

where S0 denotes a kernel sentence; BP, a basic
phrase called bunsetsu; PRED, a predicate of the
kernel sentence; Si, a sentence, mi, a NPCI and a
symbol ‘*’, closure operator on the concatenation,
‘·’. In the following, we use predicative parts,
PRED· m1· m2 · ··· · mn instead of full sentences, for
simplicity.
Our morphology model was developed so as to fit
for the general semantic processing, adopting
MWEs. It is a probabilistic finite automaton with
150 states that prescribes minutely the internal
structure of each BP and the predicative part. We
leave its detail to (Shudo et al., 1980).

Based on our morphological analyzer, we have
developed a segmenter (SEG) that segments the
input predicative part into a PRED and each NPCI,
and a NPS-constructor (NPSC) that constructs
NPSs. For example, an input;

<figure confidence="0.4163935">

5.3 Application to J/E Machine Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994075183673469">
We introduce here another experimental system,
referred to as ENGL, whose input is the NPS of a
sentence and whose output is its English forms, to
demonstrate the usefulness of our formalism.
ENGL simply realizes NPFs within English syntax.
We assumed each NPF for English could be
accomplished by applying rewriting rules of two
types; i) V x · Vv · y and ii) S x · Sv · y , where
V is a verb or an auxiliary; Vv is V, a null string, or
a variant of V; S, a sentence; Sv, a variant of S; and
x, y, a null string or a string of specific words.
Basically, a single rewriting rule is applied for a
single NPF. However, occasionally, a NPF requires
several rules to be applied successively. Also we
may have no NPCI corresponding to a given NPF
within the target language. For example,
POLITENESS, which is common in colloquial
Japanese, has mostly no NPCI in English.
For example, the computation for (12) is
GUESS2 [OBLIGATION1 [“ yomu”]]
= GUESS2 [OBLIGATION1 [read]]
= GUESS2 [have to read]
=will have to read,
where the rewriting rules associated with
NECESSITY1 and GUESS2 are V have to · Vroot
and V will · Vroot , respectively.
We give four more I/O examples In (14), the
instantaneous aspect of aruki ·hajimeru ; begin
walk-ing excludes the possibility of the
interpretations, PROGRESSING1,
PROGRESSING2 and STATE-OF-THINGS of
teiru, which remain in (13) or (15). This is because
the system deals with concatenatability rules based
on aspect features of the predicate. (ENGL simply
denotes the verb’s inflected form by -ed, -en, etc.)
with “ · daro·u” ‘will’ and “ · · ·
nakere·ba·nara·nai ” ‘have to’, respectively.
In order to examine the adequacy and sufficiency
of NPFs, we evaluated outputs of NPSC for 4,083
input predicative parts, which had been taken
randomly as a test set from newspaper articles and
segmented by SEG. It produced a recall of 97.4%
and a precision, 41.8%. The score of the recall
seems to imply the sufficiency of the set of NPFs
and NPCIs. Relatively low score of the precision is
due to the system’s over-generation caused by the
semantic ambiguities of NPCIs. Among various
measures to be taken, firstly, semantic constraints
to control the composition operation ‘◦’ may be

A small-scale experiment, for 300 NPSs extracted
from sentences in technical papers has shown that
ENGL produced a precision of 86% and a recall,
80%. While these relatively high scores implies the
fundamental validity of the NPF framework, more
extensive tests will be required to make more
reliable evaluation for the general domain, since
technical papers tend to have less-complicated
NPFs. In addition, further correction and
refinement of synthesis rules for English will be
necessary to obtain higher scores.

We have obtained approximately 30 pragmatic
rules concerned with the NPCIs in Japanese. In the
realistic tasks of NLP, application of these rules
should be controlled by rather complicated
conditions settled for each of them. For example,
conditions for rules (25) ~ (28) will include that
the agent of their complement sentence should be
the second person, and for (29), the first. Although
the principle underlying these rules were discussed
in a lot of literature, e.g., felicity condition in
(Searle, 1975), etc., the whole picture has not been
clarified for computational usage.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999616459459459">
We have shown that as far as the non-inferential,
Non-Propositional Content (NPC) in Japanese
sentence is concerned, its semantic
compositionality can be secured, provided
sentence-final MWEs are adopted properly as
NPCIs. Although the functional treatment of NPCs
is not particularly new in the theoretical domain,
our model is characterized by its broad
syntactic/semantic coverage and its tractability in
NLP. It connects syntax with semantics by actually
defining 150 non-propositional functions (NPFs)
for 1500 NPC indicators through a large-scale
empirical study. The similarity equations presented
here might lead to some formal system of
‘calculations’ on the set of NPFs, which might be
available for NLP in future.
The syntactic coverage of our semantic/pragmatic
model will surely be further broadened by
investigating non-final parts of Japanese sentences.
This research should focus on the sentence
embedment whose main verb is epistemic or
performative (Austin, 1962), and adverbs that take
part in indicating NPCs.
While the list of NPFs introduced in this paper will
provide, we believe, a basis for analyzing the NPC
of natural sentences, it might be possible, or rather
necessary for particular task, to refine NPFs by
enriching them with case-elements, more detailed
degrees or subtle differences in meaning, etc.
We have not solved the problem of semantically
disambiguating each NPCI. Further, we know little
about the language-dependency, consistency of the
similarity rules. The language-dependency of NPS
is interesting from the viewpoint of machine
translation or comparative pragmatics. The
frameworks presented here could hopefully
provide tools for those comparative studies.

Also, the relationship between indirect (Searle, 1975) and direct speech, and equations peculiar to modal logic and its family (Mally, 1926; Prior, 1967) are treated in the similarity paradigm. 1 Introduction While proper treatment of the Propositional Content (PC) of a sentence is undoubtedly important in natural language processing (NLP), the Non-propositional Content (NPC) also plays a critical role in tasks such as discourse understanding, dialogue modeling, detecting speaker’s intension. We refer generically to the information which is provided by auxiliaries, adverbs, sentence-final particles or specific predicative forms in Japanese sentences as NPC.

We have extracted extensively these expressions from large-scale Japanese linguistic data. We refer to these, including auxiliaries and ending-particles, as NPC indicators (NPCIs). The number of NPCIs amounts to 1,500, whereas that of auxiliaries and ending-particles is about 50, which is apparently insufficient for practical NLP tasks. Our model leads to dealing not only with some of illocutionary acts (Austin, 1962) but also with the logical operations peculiar to the family of modal logic, i.e., deontic (Mally, 1926) and temporal logic (Prior, 1967). We also present, in this paper, the idea of the similarity among NPCs within our framework. This is essential for text retrieval, paraphrasing, document summarization, example-based MT, etc. Some of the indirect speech acts (Searle, 1975) and axioms proper to the family of modal logic are treated formally in the similarity paradigm. In Section 2, we introduce an overview of our ongoing MWE resource development for general Japanese language processing. In Section 3, we introduce a framework for the treatment of NPC.

Each multiword expression selected as a MWE was endowed with a binary-valued basic triplet (f1, f2, f3). For example, an idiomatic, separable and not-statistically-bound expression, “ · · hone·wo·oru” ‘make an effort (lit. break bone)’ is endowed with (1,0,0) and compositional, separable and statistically-bound expression, “ · gussuri·nemuru” ‘sleep soundly’, with (0,0,1). A dot ‘·’ denotes a conventional word-boundary, hereafter. Fixed expressions, decomposable idioms, institutionalized phrases, syntactically-idiomatic phrases, light verb constructions discussed in (Sag et al., 2002) and proverbs might correspond roughly to the triplets, (1,1,0), (1,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,x,1), (0,x,1) and (1,1,1), respectively. MWEs, whose number amounts to 64,800 at present, are classified by their overall, grammatical functions as follows.

We have obtained approximately 30 pragmatic rules concerned with the NPCIs in Japanese. In the realistic tasks of NLP, application of these rules should be controlled by rather complicated conditions settled for each of them. For example, conditions for rules (25) ~ (28) will include that the agent of their complement sentence should be the second person, and for (29), the first. Although the principle underlying these rules were discussed in a lot of literature, e.g., felicity condition in (Searle, 1975), etc., the whole picture has not been clarified for computational usage. 7 Conclusions We have shown that as far as the non-inferential, Non-Propositional Content (NPC) in Japanese sentence is concerned, its semantic compositionality can be secured, provided sentence-final MWEs are adopted properly as NPCIs. Although the functional treatment of NPCs is not particularly new in the theoretical domain, our model is characterized by its broad syntactic/semantic coverage and its tractability in NLP. It connects syntax with semantics by actually defining 150 non-propositional functions (NPFs) for 1</context>
