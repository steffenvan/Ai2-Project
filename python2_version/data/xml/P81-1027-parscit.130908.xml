1. INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.999949258064516">
During the past two decades, much work in linguistics has focused on
sentences as minimal units of communication, and the project of rigorously
characterizing the structure of sentences in natural language has met with
some success. Not surprisingly, however, sentence grammars have
contributed little to the analysis of discourse. Human discourse consists not
just of words in sequences, but of words in sequences directed by a speaker
to an addressee, used to represent situations and to reveal intentions. Only
when the addressee has apprehended both these aspects of the message
communicated can the message be interpreted.
The analysis of discourse that emerges from Austin (1962), grounded in a
theory of action, takes this view as central, and the concept of the speech
act follows naturally. An utterance may have a conventional meaning, but
the interpretation of the actual meaning of the utterance as it is used in
discourse depends on evaluating the utterance in the context of the set of
intentions which represent the illocutionary mode of its presentation. Put
another way (paraphrasing Searle (1975:3)). the speaker&apos;s intention is to
produce understanding, consisting of the knowledge of conditions on the
speech act being performed.
If we are to take seriously Scarle&apos;s (1969:16) assertion that &amp;quot;the unit of
linguistic communication is not ... the symbol, word, or sentence, ... but
rather the production or the issuance of the symbol, word or sentence in the
performance of the speech act.&amp;quot; then we should be able to find some formal
method of characterizing speech acts in discourse. Unfortunately, linguists
have too often employed speech acts as taxonomic conveniences, as in Dore
(1977), Labov and Fanshel (1977), and elsewhere, without attempting to give
anything more than a descriptive definition. Only in the artificial
intelligence literature, notably in the work of Allen, Bruce, Cohen, and
Perrault (e.g. Allen (1979), Bruce and Newman (1978), Cohen and Perrault
(1979), Cohen (1978), Perrault, Allen, and Cohen (1978)), does one find an
attempt to define speech acts in terms of more general processes, here
specifically, operations on planning networks.

2. TYPES OF SPEECH ACTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997907">
A great problem for the computational linguist attempting to find a formal
representation for speech acts is that the set of speech acts does not map
uniformly onto the set of sentences. In terms of &amp;quot;goodness of fit&amp;quot; with
sentences, several types of speech acts can be described. One type, the so-
called performatives, including ASSERT, DECLARE, etc.. can be effected
in a single utterance. But even some of these can undergo further
decomposition. For example, assuming that the usual felicity conditions
hold (cf. Searle (1969:54f1)). both (1) and (2) below can count as an
apology, though neither sentence in (2) alone has the effect which their
combination achieves.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.4742215">
(1) I apologize for what I did.
(2) I did a terrible thing I&apos;m very cony.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99327776">
In (2), the first sentence contributes to the effect of an apology only to the
extent that an addressee can infer that it is intended as part of an apology.
The second sentence, which makes overt the expression of contrition, also
expresses the sincerity which is prerequisite for a felicitous apology. But its
success, too, depends on an inference by the addressee that it is intended as
part of an apology. If the addressee cannot make that inference -- because,
for example, the addressee believes that the speaker is speaking
sarcastically -- the effect of the apology is lost not only for the second
sentence, but for the first as well. In this case, the illocutionary effect
APOLOGIZE can be regarded as supra-sentential, though, as in (1),
appropriate single sentences can be used to achieve its effect.
There are other types of speech acts, however, that cannot be performed in
single utterances, but require several or even many utterances. For
example. DEFEND (as in a lawyer&apos;s action on behalf of his client),
REFUTE (as in polemical argumentation) and PROVE (as in demonstrating
effects from specific causes) cannot be effected as performatives: one
cannot make a refutation by uttering the words, l refute X, as one might
make an assertion by uttering the words. I assert X.
One might wonder whether these supra-utterance modes should count as
speech acts. Certainly, the term &amp;quot;speech act&amp;quot; has traditionally been used in
reference to single sentences or to certain classes of non-sentential
expressions which have single utterance independence in discourse (e.g.
Hello). But consider again the traditional definition. Paraphrasing Searle
(1969:48ft), a speech act is the use of an utterance directed at an addressee
in the service of a set of intentions. namely,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998276166666667">
1.) the intention to produce a certain illocutionary effect in the
addressee,
2.) the intention to produce this effect by getting the addressee to
recognize the intention to produce the effect, and
3.) the intention to produce this recognition by means of the addressee&apos;s
knowledge of the rules governing the utterance.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999667166666667">
There is nothing in this characterization that requires that utterance be
understood as sentence. &amp;quot;Ibe crucial point is that the utterance (of whatever
length) serve the set of intentions represented by 1.) - 3.). A valid speech
act can be regarded as defining an illocutionary mode which is governed by
conventions which constrain the sorts of interpretations that can be given to
utterances which occur within that mode (including our judgments on their
appropriateness). These conventions also define the conditions that must be
met for the target effect to be achieved.
Thus for the utterance / will be home by noon to count as a promise (and
not, say, as a prediction), it must be viewed as an utterance issued in the
illocutionary mode of promising, which not only defines certain well-
formcdness conditions on the utterance itself (making statements in the past
tense e.g. I was home by noon impossible as direct speech act
promises2), but also gives the criteria which determine whether the act is
successful (including the felicity conditions. etc.).
Similarly, for a series of utterances to count as a refutation, they must be
seen as operating in the illocutionary mode of refutation, as for example, in
the text below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8067025">
(3) You have stated that 2 + 2 = 3. But take any two individual
objects and any other two individual objects and place them in a
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.965360692307692">
row. Then count them. say, from left to right. What do you get?
Not 3 but 4. Therefore, 2 + 2 cannot equal 3.
We cannot interpret any of these utterances accurately unless we recognize
that each contributes to the achievement of a focused goal. viz, a refutation.
Once that intention is recognized, appropriateness and well-formcdness
conditions can be applied to the text: and the success of the act can be
measured against the set of criteria which are relevant to refutations,
including the usual felicity conditions, but also specific conditions on the
production of factual evidence and the demonstration of contradiction.
Following this new characterization of speech acts, yet another type can be
described, operating not at the utterance level, or the supra-utterance level,
but at the sub-utterance level. As an illustration of the phenomenon
involved, consider the following unexceptionable utterance:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.483917">
(4) I told the guy at the door to watch out, but he wouldn&apos;t listen.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.95290075">
The second reference to the guy of the first clause is made via the
anaphoric pronoun he. But suppose, instead, a definite referring expression
were used. Consider the following:
(5) I told the guy at the door to watch out, but the person wouldn&apos;t listen.
The person is a distinctly odd corefercnt, and seems inappropriate3. An
examination of this context reveals that the only definite4 referring
expressions which corefer felicitously are pronominal epithets. such as rhe
idiot, the fool. etc.: descriptions which can be given an interpretation as
derogativcs. such as the sophomore; and expressions whose literal
interpretation contributes some sense of explanation to the situation being
represented -- viz, that, though warned, the guy at the door didn&apos;t heed the
warning -- as in the dectfmute.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995648">
113
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.984631">
It can be shown that the principle involved is a speech act-like
phenomenon. First, it can be noted that the choice not to use the
unmarked coreferent he. signals that the speaker has some special intention
in mind. Second. following a suggestion in Bolinger (1977:7f1), it can be
argued that a repeated definite description functions not only to refer but
also to characterize the referent as having the sense of the definite
description. Finally, it can be shown that all the acceptable definite
descriptions in this context can be interpreted uniformly as offering an
explanation5 for the failure to listen expressed by the second clause.
Note that the choice of coreferent in the case of the use of a definite
referring expression is not, strictly speaking, lexically governed.
Furthermore, the use of selectional features, as in Chomsky (1965) and more
recent work on generative grammar, cannot constrain the context for such a
choice. In short, the problem is one of interpretation, and appropriateness
is governed by the intention being served by the choice of the referring
expression.
Consider, then, an utterance such as the following:
(6) 1 told the guy at the door to watch ou4 but the idiot wouldn&apos;t listen.
The difference between (4) and (6) is not merely one of different lexical
items (he and the idiot). Rather, the use of the idiot makes (6) a more
complex utterance than (4), involving an embedded speech act, namely, a
characterization whose purpose is to express an attitude and thereby
(indirectly) offer explanation.

3. SITUATION SEMANTICS AND DISCOURSE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999742500000001">
If speech acts or speech act-like phenomena are found at many levels of
discourse, and if it is not possible to give a syntactic definition of a speech
act, how can the notion of speech acts be integrated into a formal, and in
particular, a computational analysis of discourse? The natural alternative to
a syntactic definition is a semantic one6, and the approach to semantics
which offers the greatest promise in treating discourse is the situation
semantics being developed at Stanford by Jon Barwise and John Perry (cf.
Barwise (forthcoming), Barwise and Perry (1980), Barwise and Perry
(forthcoming, a), and Barwise and Perry (forthcoming, b)).
Briefly, this new semantics is informed by the notion that the actual world
can be thought of as consisting of situations, which in turn consist of objects
having properties and standing in relationships. Any actual situation is far
too rich in detail to he captured by any finite process, so in practice,
perceptions of situations. beliefs about situations, natural language
descriptions-of situations, etc.. are actually situation-types, which are partial
functions characterizing various types of situations. (Cf. Barwise (1981) for
a more complete discussion of this point)
In situation semantics, sentences do not map directly to truth-values, but
rather arc understood as designating situation-types. Totally understanding
a statement would entail that one t able to derive a situation-type which
includes all the objects, properties, and relationships represented in the
statement.
A series of statements in discourse can be viewed as creating, modifying,
embellishing, or manipulating sets of situation-types. Some utterances
invoke situation-types; some act as functions taking whole situation-types as
arguments. For example, an initial act of reference coupled with some
proposition about the referent can be seen as initiating the construction of a
situation-type around the referent: an act of coreference, with some
proposition, can be seen as adding a new property or relationship to an
individual in an existing situation-type.
The discourse situation, too, can be represented as a set of situation-types,
initially containing at least the speaker, the addressee, and the mutual
knowledge of speaker and addressee that they arc in a discourse situation.
Any utterance which occurs exploits this discourse situation and cannot be&apos;
interpreted independently of it. The utterance itself, however, effects a
change in the discourse situation, as its interpretation is added. It is in
representing the effect of the utterance that the theory of speech acts has
application.
The dynamic process of discourse can be modelled as a step by step
modification of the discourse situation, with each step taking the set of
situation-types of the discourse situation, coupled with the interpretation of
the utterance, to a new set of situation-types of the discourse situation.
There arc many interesting details to this model which must be ignored in a
paper of this scope, but several observations relevant to speech acts can be
made.
First.. this model accommodates the distinction made by most speech act
theorists between what a speaker says — the locutionary act -- and what a
speaker intends to communicate (or means) — the illocutionary act7. This
distinction is repeated and captured here in the treatment of the actual
discourse as a pair of sets of situation-types. One gives the set of situation-
types of the text (written or spoken) -- h - and can be regarded as
representing the locutionary aspect of the act. The other gives the set of
situation-types of the discourse situation (including author and reader or
speaker and addressee) -- sd — and can be regarded as representing the state
of knowledge about the discourse -- including the information revealed by
inferring the intentions of the speaker — at the time the utterance is
produced. The interpretation of st relative to sd. f (&lt;st. sd&gt;). gives a new set
of situation-types of the discourse situation. sd&apos;. The illocutionary act can
be thought of as difference between sd&apos; and sd.
Second. this characterization of an illocutionary act is consonant with
psychological features of actual discourse. In actual interaction, what the
speaker says -- the locutionary act — is highly volatile: the exact words of
an utterance more than a few seconds past may be lost forever. What
remains is the effect of those words, in particular, as composed in longer-
term memory. What is remembered represents the state achieved by the
discourse, and that reflects directly what the addressee has inferrred about&apos;
the speaker&apos;s intentions. Put another way, what becomes stored as memory
represents what the addressee inferred about what the speaker meant by his
unerance.8
Third. one can regard the problem of interpreting the current status of the
discourse as similar to the problem of deriving the current state in a
STRIPS-like system (cf. Fikes and Nilsson (1971)): the correct version must
be the result of the application of a series of operations, in correct order, to
all previous states. The current set of situation-types of the discourse
situation can be seen as representing the accumulation of the effects that
have resulted from a series of discrete operations.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.998029" genericHeader="method">
4. OPERATIONS ON SITUATION-TYPES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994035">
There arc various ways that a word or phrase can count as an operation on
a situation-type. For example, an utterance or part of an utterance could
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9451804">
(a) take a whole situation-type as an argument, or
(b) introduce an object and a property, or
(c) inuLduce two or more objects and a relationship, or
(d) introduce an object or a property or a relationship into an
existing situation-type.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.968345692307692">
Case (a) would apply to phrases like by the may, anyway, etc., which have
the effect of shifting focus or &amp;quot;clearing the slate&amp;quot; for a new text fragment.
Cases (b) and (c) ensure that the utterance or part of utterance, if text
initial, contains enough information to enable a situation-type to be derived.
Case (d) accounts for those instances where a situation-type is clearly
established and a single word or reference can effect a change in the
situation-type.
For example, the name John (used constatively) at the beginning of an
interaction cannot count as a operation on a situation-type, as no situation-
type of the discourse text then exists, and the name John alone cannot
create one. However, the name John after a question, such as Who took my
book?, can count as a operation, since it, together with the interpretation of
the question, serves to introduce a new object and properties into an
existing situation-type.
Returning to a sentence like (6) (repeated below), it is possible to see that.
in fact, a series of operations-are involved in deriving the final situation-type
of the text.
(6) 1 told the guy at the door to watch out, but the idiot wouldn&apos;t listen.
The utterance corresponding to the first grammatical clause creates the
situation-type in which there is the guy at the door and the speaker and the
relationship of the speaker having told the guy at the door to watch out.
The word but can be viewed as function mapping situation-types into
situation-types where a relationship or property somehow implicated in the
first situation-type is &apos;shown explicitly not to hold in the derived situation-
type. The balance of the second clause modifies the situation-type so that
the guy at the door now has the property both of having been told by the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997491">
114
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998385">
speaker to watch out, and of having not listened, manifesting the violation
of supposed normative behavior. The fact that the guy at the door has been
referred to as the idiot has added a further property, or characterization.
The situation-type of the text at the end of the utterance of the second
clause includes the speaker with the property of having told the guy at the
door to watch out and having judged him as an idiot for not listening, and
the guy at the door who had been told to watch out by the speaker but who
did not listen, and who has been judged to have behaved idiotically. (There
actually are other relationships here, but a more complete description adds
nothing to the general point being illustrated.)
In this case, then, there are at least three steps in the &amp;quot;semantic&amp;quot; parsing of
the utterance: the initial creation of the situation-type (the first clause), the
interpretation of but, and the modification of the initial situation-type to
accommodate the information in thc second clause.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.716334" genericHeader="method">
5. SPEECH ACTS AS OPERATIONS ON SITUATION-TYPES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985893258064516">
Thus far the relationship between situation-types and speech acts has not
been made explicit. Recall that speech acts can be characterized as having
both an intentional component and some representation of the conditions
which must be met for the speech act to.have been successfully performed.
But more importantly, a speech act is not successfully performed until the
addressee recognizes that its performance was attempted: and that
recognition effects a change in the relationship between the speaker and the
addressee. This change in relationship can be regarded as an effect of an
operation on the set of situation-types of the discourse situation (not of the
text). But a speech act, even if clearly understood as intended, is not
successful unless it effects specific changes in the set of situation-types of
the text. as well. Therefore, speech acts can be thought of as the effects of
the application of one or more inference enabling functions to the pair of
sets of situation-types giving the model of the discourse (f (&lt;st, sd&gt;)).
It is possible to use situation-types as the basis of a definition of speech acts
by requiring that speech acts be the result of the application of an inference
enabling function to an utterance in a discourse situation such that the
derived situation-type conforms to one of a (finite) number of speech act-
types. In other words, for an utterance or a series of utterances to count as
a speech act, the utterance or utterances must minimally
(i) perform an operation on a situation-type, and
(ii) derive a situation-type which is defined (for speaker and addressee)
as the legitimate cnd state of a speech act.
Sub-utterance speech acts can be accounted for, now, by viewing the
situation-types of the text which they achieve as being dependent on or
coincident with the situation-types achieved by the whole of the utterance in
which they are embedded. Of course, there must be an accompanying
operation on the situation-type of the discourse situation representing the
effect of the perceived intention to achieve the sub-utcrance speech act -- as
in the marked choice of a definite referring expression instead of a simple
pronoun, as in (6).
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.9298396">
Supra-utterance speech acts can also be captured in this framework. A
speech act like REFUTE, for example, cannot be defined in terms of any
specifiable number of steps, or any specifiable ordering of operations. Its
only possible definition is in terms of a final state in which all the
conditions on refutation have been satisfied. In terms of situation
semantics, this corresponds to a set of situation-types -- albeit very
complex -- in which all the necessary relationships hold. Since such
complex sets of situation-types represent the accumulated effects of all the
operations which have occurred, without representing the order of
application of those operations, there is nothing in the definition of
REFUTE that requires that a specific order of operations be carried out.
Someone might refute an argument very efficiently: someone else, only after
a series of false starts or after the introduction of numerous irrelevancies.
The end result would be, and should be, the same, from a speech act-
theoretic point of view.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.846229636363636">
This characterization of speech acts, as the end states of a derivation on a
sequence of situation types, explains naturally some of the culture-relative
characteristics of supra-utterance speech acts. To take but one example, it
has been noted in Taylor (1971) that in agrarian Japanese society there is no
notion that corresponds to NEGOTIATE. Clearly. given the manifest
success of urban Japanese to obtain lucrative foreign contracts, the absence
of such a speech act-type among rural Japanese cannot be attributed to facts
of the Japanese language. What we could say, given the approach here, is
that the set of situation-types which is the end-state of NEGOTIATE is not,
part of the inventory of distinguished speech act-types in the rural Japanese
&amp;quot;discourse dialect.&amp;quot;

6. SOME EXAMPLES OF SPEECH ACT-TYPES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97420192">
The following sets of situation-types can serve as examples of the states
achieved by several simple, constative speech act-types. As before, the
taxonomic features are based on Bach and Harnish (1979), with speaker, S.
addressee(s), A. and proposition, P.
This means that the rules governing the form of speech acts are actually INFORM P P)
rules specifying the relationships that must obtain in the situation-type 51: s (s.2y, S. S.

short, this allows us to view speech acts as being driven by certain situation- b(cliEts, in
types as goals. si, S. s3 are
Simpler speech act-types. such as performatives, correspond neatly to
various unary operations on situation-types. An assertion operates on the
situation-type of the text by introducing objects and properties or
relationships that correspond to the proposition of the assertion. But it also&apos;
introduces the speaker in an ASSERT relationship to the proposition. And
given the constraints on truly felicitous assertions, this would also introduce
the implicaturc that the speaker believes the proposition. In particular,
following the taxonomy and characterization of illocutionary acts in Bach
and Harnish (1979:39(1). an assertion has the effect, for any speaker. S. and
any proposition, P. of creating the following situation-type:
s (believe. S. P) = 1
By accepting the assertion -- different from accepting the truth of the
assertion -- the addressee acknowledges that the above situation-type is
added to the set of situation-types giving the discourse situation.
A complete description of the speech act-type ASSERT would consist of the
following set of situation-types:

The characterization of speech acts presented here focuses on end-state
conditions. but clearly the starting states (specifically, the set of situation-
types of the discourse situation and of the text from which an end-state is to
be achieved) also affect speech act performance. A more complete
specification of the initial and final states of the discourse pair of sets of
situation-types for a variety of speech act-types, involving an elaboration of
the role of inference enabling functions and other constraints on the
interpretation of utterances, is given in Evans (in progress).

2. It has been pointed out to me by Dwight Bolinger that some utterances
in Spanish in the past tense can count as direct speech act promises (e.g. Un
moment° y acabe.). This sort of promise is similar to the English
exclamation. Done!, which can be used in sufficiently constrained contexts
to effect a promise or commitment.

Winograd.

horse in this SCITlilniC troika: what a speaker actually achieves by his
utterance. i.e. how his utterance affects the addressee — the perlocutionary
effect. This three-way contrast was first articulated by Austin (cf. Austin
( 1962: 1001I)).

What we could say, given the approach here, is that the set of situation-types which is the end-state of NEGOTIATE is not, part of the inventory of distinguished speech act-types in the rural Japanese &amp;quot;discourse dialect.&amp;quot; 6. SOME EXAMPLES OF SPEECH ACT-TYPES The following sets of situation-types can serve as examples of the states achieved by several simple, constative speech act-types. As before, the taxonomic features are based on Bach and Harnish (1979), with speaker, S. addressee(s), A. and proposition, P.

Unfortunately, linguists have too often employed speech acts as taxonomic conveniences, as in Dore (1977), Labov and Fanshel (1977), and elsewhere, without attempting to give anything more than a descriptive definition. Only in the artificial intelligence literature, notably in the work of Allen, Bruce, Cohen, and Perrault (e.g. Allen (1979), Bruce and Newman (1978), Cohen and Perrault (1979), Cohen (1978), Perrault, Allen, and Cohen (1978)), does one find an attempt to define speech acts in terms of more general processes, here specifically, operations on planning networks. 2. TYPES OF SPEECH ACTS A great problem for the computational linguist attempting to find a formal representation for speech acts is that the set of speech acts does not map uniformly onto the set of sentences. In terms of &amp;quot;goodness of fit&amp;quot; with sentences, several types of speech acts can be described. One type, the socalled performatives, including ASSERT, DECLARE, etc.. can be effected in a single utterance.</context>

Only when the addressee has apprehended both these aspects of the message communicated can the message be interpreted. The analysis of discourse that emerges from Austin (1962), grounded in a theory of action, takes this view as central, and the concept of the speech act follows naturally. An utterance may have a conventional meaning, but the interpretation of the actual meaning of the utterance as it is used in discourse depends on evaluating the utterance in the context of the set of intentions which represent the illocutionary mode of its presentation. Put another way (paraphrasing Searle (1975:3)). the speaker&apos;s intention is to produce understanding, consisting of the knowledge of conditions on the speech act being performed. If we are to take seriously Scarle&apos;s (1969:16) assertion that &amp;quot;the unit of linguistic communication is not ... the symbol, word, or sentence, ... but rather the production or the issuance of the symbol, word or sentence in the performance of the speech act.&amp;quot; then we should be able to find some formal method of characterizing speech acts in discourse.
