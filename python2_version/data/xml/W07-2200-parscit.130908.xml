Welcome to the Tenth International Conference on Parsing Technologies, IWPT 2007, in the beautiful
city of Prague.
IWPT’07 continues the tradition of biennial workshops on parsing technology organized by SIGPARSE,
the Special Interest Group on Parsing of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). The first
workshop, in Pittsburgh and Hidden Valley, was followed by workshops in Cancun (Mexico) in 1991;
Tilburg (Netherlands) and Durbuy (Belgium) in 1993; Prague and Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) in
1995; Boston/Cambridge (Massachusetts) in 1997; Trento (Italy) in 2000; Beijing (China) in 2001; Nancy
(France) in 2003; and Vancouver (Canada) in 2005.
Over the years the IWPT Workshops have become the major forum for researchers in natural language
parsing. They have also given rise to four books on parsing technologies.
For the first time this year, IWPT is organised as a co-located event with the main ACL conference and
with EMNLP and many other workshops. We would like to thank Alon Lavie, Priscilla Rasmussen and
the ACL committee and local organisers for their help and support in organising this event.
Parsing technologies are relevant for almost all applications in Natural Language Processing. We are
fortunate to have Stuart Shieber from Harvard University as our invited speaker to explore the links
between sychronous grammars and issues related to machine translation and parsing.
This year’s programme features for the first time invited presentations by organisers of co-located events
who are also members of the IWPT Programme Committee. Joakim Nivre makes a connection with
learning dependency grammars in the CONLL-07 shared task, and the organisers of the Deep Linguistic
Processing workshop discuss the ways in which broad coverage parsing systems can be developed for
linguistically expressive grammars.
I would to thank all the programme committee members for their careful and timely work, especially
those that took up extra rewiewing obligations at very short notice. Special thanks go to Paola Merlo, the
programme chair, for organising the reviewing, designing the workshop programme and producing the
proceedings. The scientific programme includes 14 full papaer and 3 short papers out of 31 submissions
(of which 6 short papers). They cover all topics in parsing, from efficiency issues and complextiy of
algorithms to accurate supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for parsing.
