Welcome to the ACL 2014 Student Research Workshop.
Following the previous years’ ACL Student Research Workshops, this year we have two different kinds
of papers: research papers and thesis proposals. Thesis proposals are intended for advanced students
who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for
their continuing work, while research papers can describe completed work or work in progress with
preliminary results.
We received 7 thesis proposals and 19 research papers this year. Out of these, we accepted 5 thesis
proposals and 8 research papers leading to an acceptance rate of 71% for thesis proposals and 42%
for research papers. This year’s workshop also offered pre-submission mentoring for student authors
wishing to improve the presentation of their papers prior to submission of the paper for the reviewing
process. 6 students participated in this pre-submission mentoring program this year.
The SRW offers multiple avenues for the student authors to receive feedback at the conference.
This year’s workshop features three sessions of student paper presentations. All the papers will be
presented at the main conference poster session, giving the opportunity for students to interact and
present their work to a large and diverse audience. We also have a separate oral presentation session
for thesis proposal papers on the first day of the main conference. The third session is another oral
presentation venue where student authors of the research papers briefly advertise their posters. This year,
15 students whose papers were accepted to the ACL main conference were chosen to also present their
work at and be partially funded by SRW. These students’ posters are also advertised during the poster
highlight session.
In addition to oral presentation and poster sessions, each SRW paper and the 15 papers sponsored by the
SRW is assigned a dedicated mentor. The mentor is an experienced researcher from academia or industry
who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance for the presentation or poster session and
will provide feedback to the student author.
Thanks to our funding sources, this year’s SRW covers registration expenses and provides travel and
lodging support to all student authors of the SRW papers. We gratefully acknowledge the support from
the NSF, Google, Yahoo! and Baidu. In addition to the SRW papers, the NSF supports travel and
registration for another 15 student authors of ACL main conference papers.
We are very grateful to our program committee members who gave constructive and detailed reviews for
each of the student papers. Some of our PC members also participated in the pre-submission mentoring
program and immensely helped student authors with writing and presentation of their papers. We also
thank researchers who agreed to mentor and provide expert feedback on the student papers. We thank
our faculty advisers Bill Byrne and Jordan Boyd-Graber for their guidance. We also thank the ACL 2014
organizing committee – Daniel Marcu, Kristina Toutanova, Hua Wu, Alexander Koller, Miyao Yusuke,
David Yarowsky and Priscilla Rassmussen for their constant support and suggestions. Finally, we thank
all students for their submissions and participation in the SRW.
