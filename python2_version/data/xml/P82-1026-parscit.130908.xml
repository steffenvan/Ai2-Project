The Association for Computational Linguistics
is twenty years old. We have much to be proud of:
a fine journal, significant annual meetings, and a
strong presence in the professional community.
Computational Linguistics, itself, has much to be
proud of: influence in the research community,
courses in universities, research support in
government and industry, and attention in the
popular press.
Not to spoil the fun, but the same was true
twenty years ago and the society and the field has
had to go through some difficult times since then.
To be sure, much has changed. The ACL has over
1200 members. Computational Linguistics has many
new facets and potential applications. However to
an outsider, we still appear to be a field with
potential rather than one with achievement. Why
is that?
There are certainly many reasons. One is the
attractiveness of our most abstract theories.
They are widely presented and receive the most
scholarly attention. The popular end technical
press contributes by publicizing our wilder claims
and broadest hopes. Similarly, the press
oversells our current systems, leading more
careful observers to wonder even about these.
Fina]ly, mechanizing the understanding of natural
language is very difficult. We can not hope to
achieve many of our goals in the near future.
Making do with the technology now available is
very frustrating. All this contributes to we the
members of the field gravitating to theorizing and
small laboratory studies. We are choosing to
focus on the future rather than the present.
There is a real danger in this state of
affairs. The build up of public and institutional
expectations without a corresponding emergence of
useful systems will produce a counter reaction.
We have seen it before. To this day, machine
translation research in the United States has not
completely recovered. There is more need than
ever, there is more technology than before, word
processing and computer typesetting have changed
the price equation, but it is still not considered
wise to be associated with MT. We can not let
this sort of reversal happen to us again.
Fortunately, we need not.
We do have substantial achievements. Over
the years, we have produced or had influence on
useful systems for information storage and
retrieval, speech understanding and generation,
and document processing. Natural language
interfaces to databases are just now reaching the
market. There are even limited but useful machine
translation systems. There is more that we all
know can and will be done in these areas.
This will not be easy. We must accept the
compromises forced on us by our limited
technology. We must accept the unglamorous work
that needs to be done. We must be careful in the
way we present our work.
It will not be all bad. There appear to be
some attractive financial returns. These are not
to be ignored. In fact, it would probably do us
all good if Computational Linguistics had a few
millionaires to its credit.
We must congratulate ourselves on twenty
years of life, but we must also work hard to carry
off another twenty years. I am sure we will.
