<bodyText confidence="0.99963159375">
Computational linguistics methods are typ-
ically first developed and tested in English.
When applied to other languages, assump-
tions from English data are often applied
to the target language. One of the most
common such assumptions is that a “stan-
dard” part-of-speech (POS) tagset can be
used across languages with only slight vari-
ations. We discuss in this paper a specific is-
sue related to the definition of a POS tagset
for Modern Hebrew, as an example to clar-
ify the method through which such varia-
tions can be defined. It is widely assumed
that Hebrew has no syntactic category of
modals. There is, however, an identified
class of words which are modal-like in their
semantics, and can be characterized through
distinct syntactic and morphologic criteria.
We have found wide disagreement among
traditional dictionaries on the POS tag at-
tributed to such words. We describe three
main approaches when deciding how to tag
such words in Hebrew. We illustrate the im-
pact of selecting each of these approaches
on agreement among human taggers, and on
the accuracy of automatic POS taggers in-
duced for each method. We finally recom-
mend the use of a “modal” tag in Hebrew
and provide detailed guidelines for this tag.
Our overall conclusion is that tagset defini-
tion is a complex task which deserves appro-
priate methodology.

<bodyText confidence="0.999819193548387">
In this paper we address one linguistic issue that was
raised while tagging a Hebrew corpus for part of
speech (POS) and morphological information. Our
corpus is comprised of short news stories. It in-
cludes roughly 1,000,000 tokens, in articles of typ-
ical length between 200 to 1000 tokens. The arti-
cles are written in a relatively simple style, with a
high token/word ratio. Of the full corpus, a sam-
ple of articles comprising altogether 100,000 tokens
was assembled at random and manually tagged for
part of speech. We employed four students as tag-
gers. An initial set of guidelines was first composed,
relying on the categories found in several dictionar-
ies and on the Penn treebank POS guidelines (San-
torini, 1995). Tagging was done using an automatic
tool&apos;. We relied on existing computational lexicons
(Segal, 2000; Yona, 2004) to generate candidate tags
for each word. As many words from the corpus were
either missing or tagged in a non uniform manner in
the lexicons, we recommended looking up missing
words in traditional dictionaries. Disagreement was
also found among copyrighted dictionaries, both for
open and closed set categories. Given the lack of
a reliable lexicon, the taggers were not given a list
of options to choose from, but were free to tag with
whatever tag they found suitable. The process, al-
though slower and bound to produce unintentional
mistakes, was used for building a lexicon, and to
refine the guidelines and on occasion modify the
POS tagset. When constructing and then amending
the guidelines we sought the best trade-off between

accuracy and meaningfulness of the categorization,
and simplicity of the guidelines, which is important
for consistent tagging.
Initially, each text was tagged by four different
people, and the guidelines were revised according
to questions or disagreements that were raised. As
the guidelines became more stable, the disagreement
rate decreased, each text was tagged by three peo-
ple only and eventually two taggers and a referee
that reviewed disagreements between the two. The
disagreement rate between any two taggers was ini-
tially as high as 20%, and dropped to 3% after a few
rounds of tagging and revising the guidelines.
Major sources of disagreements that were identi-
fied, include:
Prepositional phrases vs. prepositions In Hebrew,
formative letters – b,c,l,m2 – can be attached
to a noun to create a short prepositional phrase. In
some cases, such phrases function as a preposition
and the original meaning of the noun is not clearly
felt. Some taggers would tag the word as a prepo-
sitional prefix + noun, while others tagged it as a
preposition, e.g., b’iqbot (following), that
can be tagged as b-iqbot (in the footsteps
of).
Adverbial phrases vs. Adverbs the problem is simi-
lar to the one above, e.g., bdiyuq (exactly), can
be tagged as b-diyuq (with accuracy).
Participles vs. Adjectives as both categories can
modify nouns, it is hard to distinguish between
them, e.g, mabat. m’ayem (a threatening
stare) - the category of m’ayem is unclear.
Another problem, on which the remainder of the ar-
ticle focuses, was a set of words that express modal-
ity, and commonly appear before verbs in the infini-
tive. Such words were tagged as adjectives or ad-
verbs, and the taggers were systematically uncertain
about them.
Beside the disagreement among taggers, there
was also significant disagreement among Modern
Hebrew dictionaries we examined, as well as com-
putational analyzers and annotated corpora. Ta-
ble 1 lists the various selected POS tags for these
words, as determined by: (1) Rav Milim (Choueka
et al., 1997), (2) Sapir (Avneyon et al., 2002), (3)
Even-Shoshan (Even-Shoshan, 2003), (4) Knaani

(Knaani, 1960), (5) HMA (Carmel and Maarek,
1999), (6) Segal (Segal, 2000), (7) Yona (Yona,
2004), (8) Hebrew Treebank (Sima’an et al., 2001).
As can be seen, eight different POS tags were
suggested by these dictionaries: adJective (29.6%),
adveRb (25.9%), Verb (22.2%), Auxilary verb
(8.2%), Noun (4.4%), parTicle (3.7%), Preposition
(1.5%), and Unknown (4.5%). The average number
of options per word is about 3.3, which is about 60%
agreement. For none of the words there was a com-
prehensive agreement, and the PoS of only seven
words (43.75%) can be determinded by voting (i.e.,
there is one major option).
In the remainder of the paper, we investigate the
existence of a modal category in Modern Hebrew,
by analyzing the characteristic of these words, from
a morphological, syntactic, semantic and practical
point of view. The decision whether to introduce
a modal tag in a Hebrew tagset has practical con-
sequences: we counted that over 3% of the tokens
in our 1M token corpus can potentially be tagged
as modals. Beyond this practical impact, the deci-
sion process illustrates the relevant method through
which a tagset can be derived and fine tuned.

2 Modality in Hebrew
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997801619047619">
Semantically, Modus is considered to be the attitude
on the part of the speaking subject with regard to
its content (Ducrot and Todorov, 1972), as opposed
to the Dictum which is the linguistic realization of
a predicate. While a predicate is most commonly
represented with a verb, modality can be uttered in
various manners: adjectives and adverbs (definitely,
probable), using thought/belief verbs, mood, into-
nation, or with modal verbs. The latter are recog-
nized as a grammatical category in many languages
(modals), e.g., can, should and must in English.
From the semantic perspective, modality is
coarsely divided into epistemic modality (the
amount of confidence the speaker holds with ref-
erence to the truth of the proposition) and deontic
modality (the degree of force exerted on the sub-
ject of the sentence to perform the action) views (de
Haan, 2005).
Modal expressions do not constitute a syntactic
class in Modern Hebrew (Kopelovich, 1982). In
her work, Kopelovich reviews classic descriptive

publications on the syntax of Hebrew and claims
that these works (Ornan, Rubinstein, Azar, Rosen,
Aronson-Berman and Maschler)3 do not provide a
satisfying description or explanation of the mat-
ter. In this section we review three major ap-
proaches to modality in Hebrew - the first is seman-
tic (Kopelovich), the second is semantic-syntactic
(Zadka) and the third is purely morphologico-
syntactic (Rosen).
Kopelovich provides three binary dimensions that
describe the modal system in Hebrew: Personal -
Impersonal, Modality - Modulation and Objective -
Subjective plane. The Personal-Impersonal system
is connected to the absence or presence of a surface
subject in the clause. A personal modal has a gram-
matical subject:

dawid carik lhasi‘ ’et ’imo
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.962312925925926">
David should to-drive ACC mother-POSS
David should drive his mother
An impersonal modal has no grammatical subject,
and modality predicates the entire clause.
(2)
carik lhasi‘ ’et ’imo la‘abodah
should to-drive ACC mother-POSS to-the-work
His mother should be driven to work
Kopelovich makes no distinction between the vari-
ous syntactic categories that the words may belong
to, and interchangeably uses examples of words like
mutar, yes, ’epsar [adverb, existential,
participle respectively].
The Modality-Modulation plane, according to
the functional school of Halliday (Halliday, 1985),
refers to the interpersonal and ideational functions
of language: Modality expresses the speaker’s own
mind (epistemic modality - possibility, probability
and certainty) ‘alul laredet gesem
mah. ar (it may rain tomorrow). Modulation par-
ticipates in the content clause expressing external
conditions in the world (deontic modality - permis-
sion, obligation, ability and inclination):
’ata yakol lhath. il ‘aksaw (you can start
now). Modality does not carry tense and cannot be
negated, while modulation can be modified by tense
and can be negative.

The Objective-Subjective plane is what
Kopelovich calls the perception of the world.
Objectivity is achieved using different tenses of
to-be in conjunction with the modal (including tense
of modal if it is a verb), and their order subjective
vs. objective:

not accept a subordinate clause as subject or object:

and (7) Negation. Categories 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are
considered by Zadka to include pure modal verbs,
e.g., alethic and deontic verbs.
In his paper, Zadka defines classification criteria
that refer to syntactic-semantic properties such as:
can the infinitive verb be realized as a relative clause,
are the subject of the verb and its complement the
same, can the infinitive be converted to a gerund,
animacy of subject; deep semantic properties – argu-
ment structure and selectional restrictions, the abil-
ity to drop a common subject of the verb and its
complement, factuality level (factual, non-factual,
counter-factual); and morphological properties.
Will, Manner and Aspectual verbs as Zadka de-
fines are not considered modals by Kopelovich since
they can be inflected by tense (with the excep-
tions of ’amur (supposed), ‘atid (should).
Ability verbs are yakol (can), msugal
(can,capable) [participle]. They have both an ani-
mate actor as a subject and an infinitive as a comple-
ment, with the same deep subject. These verbs are
counter-factual.
Certainty verbs include mukrak (must),
carik (should), ne’elac (be forced to), yakol
(can), hekreh. i (necessary), ‘asuy (may),
‘alul (might), capuy (expected). They rep-
resent the alethic and epistemic necessity or pos-
sibility of the process realized in the clause. All
of them cannot be inflected morphologically. The
modal predicates the whole situation in the proposi-
tion, and may be subjective (epistemic) or objective
(alethic). The subject of these verbs coreferences
with the subject of the modal:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.720787">
(9)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.958130263157895">
’ani mukrak liqnot mkonit
I must to-buy car
I must buy a car
Necessity/Obligation includes adjectives – e.g.,
h. ayab (must), rasa’y (allowed), gerunds –
mukrah. (must), ’asur (forbidden),
mutar (allowed) and the verb yakwl (can) 5. Ne-
cessity verbs/proverbs present deontic modality, and
all clauses share, in Zadka’s view - a causing partic-
ipant that is not always realized in the surface.
From the morphological point of view, one may
characterize impersonals by a non-inflectional be-
havior, e.g., yes, ’ein, mutar, ’asur,
’epsar, ’ikpat. All of these words do
not inflect in number and gender with their argu-
ment. But this criterion leaves out all of the gender-
quantity inflected words, e.g., ra’uy, msu-
gal, ‘alul, ’amur, carik, yakol,
which are all classified as modals by Zadka. On
the other hand, including all the gender-quantity in-
flected words with infinite or relative clause com-
plements as modals, will include certain adjectives,
e.g., musmak (certified), nouns, e.g., zkut
(credit), and participles, e.g., nimna‘ (avoid), as
well. It appears that Zadka’s classification relies pri-
marily on semantic criteria.
Rosen (1977, pp. 113-115) defines a syntactic cat-
egory he calls impersonals. Words in this category
occur only as the predicative constituent of a sen-
tence with an infinitive or a subordinate clause argu-
ment. Past and future tense is marked with the aux-
ilary verb hayah (to-be). In addition, imperson-
als cannot function as predicative adjectives:
kda’i (worthwhile), mutab (better), ’ikpat
(care/mind).
Personal reference can be added to the clause
(governed by the infinitive) with the l dative prepo-
sition:

2.1 Criteria to Identify Modal-like Words in
Hebrew
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991126">
We have reviewed three major approaches to catego-
rizing modals in Hebrew:
Semantic - represented mostly in Kopelovich’s
work, modality is categorized by three dimensions
of semantic attributes. Since her claim is that there
is no syntactic category of modality at all, this ap-
proach ‘over-generates’ modals and includes words
that from any other syntactic or morphologic view
fall into other parts of speech.
Syntactic-semantic - Zadka classifies seven sets of
verbs and pro-verbs following syntactic and seman-
tic criteria. His claim is that modality actually is
marked by syntactic characteristics, which can be
Sas well as nouns and prepositions - among them and
yes and ’ein - according to Zadka

identified by structural criteria. However, his eval-
uation mixes semantics with syntactic attributes.
Morphological-syntactic - Rosen’s definition of Im-
personals is strictly syntactic/morpholgical and does
not try to characterize words with modality. Conse-
quently, words that are usually considered modals,
are not included in his definition ’asur (forbid-
den), mutar (allowed), yakol (can).

3 Proposed Modal Guidelines to Identify
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998928833333333">
The variety of criteria proposed by linguists reflects
the disagreements we identified in lexicographic
work about modal-like words in Hebrew. For a com-
putational application, all words in a corpus must
be tagged. Given the complex nature of modality
in Hebrew, should we introduce a modal tag in our
tagset, or instead, rely on other existing tags? We
have decided to introduce a modal tag in our He-
brew tagset. Although there is no distinct syntac-
tic category for modals in Hebrew, we propose the
following criteria: (i) They have an infinitive com-
plement or a clausal complement introduced by the
binder s. (ii) They are NOT adjectives. (iii) They
have irregular inflections in the past tense, i.e.,
raciti lada‘at (I wanted to know) is not a modal
usage.
The tests to distinguish modal from non-modal
usages are:

<listItem confidence="0.975991923076923">
• and which can be also existential, are
used as modals if they can be replaced with
.
• Adjectives are gradable and can be modified by
m’od (very) or yoter (more).
• Adjectives can become describers of the nomi-
nalized verb:  qal
laharos  haharisah qala m’od (easy to de-
stroy  the destruction is easy).
• In all other cases where a verb is serving in to
convey modality, it is still tagged as a verb, e.g.,
muban syosi hu’ hamnaceh.
(it is clear that Yossi is the winner).

<bodyText confidence="0.9995602">
We first review how these guidelines help us ad-
dress some of the most difficult tagging decisions we
had to face while building the corpus, we then indi-
cate quantitatively the impact of the modal tag on
the practical problem of tagging.

3.1 ”What do I care”
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957464583333333">
One of the words tagged as a modal in our corpus
- the word ’ikpat – is not considered thus far
to be a modal. However, at least in some of its in-
stances it fits our definition of modal, and it can also
be interpreted as modality according to its sense.
The only definition that is consistent with our ob-
servation is Rosen’s impersonals.
Looking back at its origins, we checked the His-
torical Lexicon of the Hebrew Language6, the word
was used in the medieval period in the Talmud
and the Mishna, where it only appears in the follow-
ing construction:

what care to-you
what do you care
Similarly, in the Ben Yehuda Project – an Israeli
version of the Guttenberg project7 which includes
texts from the Middle Ages up to the beginning of
the 20th century – we have found 28 instances of the
word, with the very same usage as in older times.
While trying to figure its part of speech, we do not
identify as a NOUN - as it cannot have a defi-
nite marker 8, and is not an adjective9.
Traditional Hebrew Dictionaries consider to
be an intransitive verb (Kohut, 1926; Even-Shoshan,
2003; Avneyon et al., 2002) or an adverb. Some
dictionaries from the middle of the 20th century
(Gur, 1946; Knaani, 1960), as well as recent ones
(Choueka et al., 1997) did not give it a part of speech
at all.
In our corpus we found 130 occurences of the
word of which 55 have an infinitive/relative
clause complement, 35 have null complement, and
40 have m PP complement ’ikpat
lo mehamdina (he cares for the country). The latter
has no modal interpretation. We claim that in this
case it should be tagged as a participle ( ). The
test to tell apart modal and participle is:

All other tests for modality hold in this case: (1)

To conclude this section, our proposed definition of
modals allows us to tag this word in a systematic
and complete manner and to avoid the confusion that
characterizes this word.

3.2 ”It’s really hard”
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991755859375">
Some of the words tagged as modals are commonly
referred to as adjectives, such as ’asur,
mutar (allowed, forbidden), though everyone agrees
- and tags these words as adverbs or participals (see
table 1). However, questions are raised of how to
tell apart modals as such from adjectives that show
very similar properties: qase li laleket
(it is hard for me to walk). Ambar (1995) analyzes
the usage of adjectives in modal contexts, especially
of ability and possibility. In sentences such as
qale lanu lhistagel lara‘as (it is hard
for us to get used to the noise) the adjective is used in
a modal and not an adverbial meaning, in the sense
that meaning of the adverbial bqwsi (with diffi-
culty) and the modal yakwl (can) are unified into
a single word . Similarly, the possibility sense of
is unified with the modal ’epsar. In any
usage of the adjective as the modal, it is not possible
to rephrase a clause in a way that the adjective mod-
ifies the noun, i.e., the range is the action itself and
not its subject.
qale lbace‘ ’et haheskem
hard to-perform PREP the-agreement
It is hard to perform the agreement
(15)*
haheskem kase
the-agreement hard
The agreement is hard
However, following Ambar, there are cases where
the usage of qale le is not modal, but an emo-
tional adjective:
qase/na‘im lsoh. eh. ’ito
hard/pleasant to-chat with-him
It is hard/pleasant to chat with him
Berman (1980) classifies subjectless construc-
tions in Modern Hebrew, and distinguishes what she
calls dative-marked experientials where (mostly)
adjective serves as a predicate followed by a dative-
marked nominal
qale le-rinah bah. ayim
hard for-Rina in-the-life
It is hard for Rina in life
Adjectives that allow this construction are cir-
cumstantial and do not describe an inner state:
rina ‘acuba (Rina is sad) vs. ‘acub
lrina (it is sad for Rina). Another recognized con-
struction is the modal expressions that include sen-
tences with dative marking on the individuals to
whom the modality is imputed
’asur lanu ldaber kakah (we are not allowed to talk
like this); Berman suggests that the similarity is due
to the perception of the experiencer as recipient in
both cases; This suggestion implies that Berman
does not categorize the modals (’asur, mutar) as ad-
jectives. Another possible criterion to allow these
words to be tagged as modals (following Zadka) is
the fact that for Necessary/Obligation modals there
exists an ’outside force’ which is the agent of the
modal situation. Therefore, if ’asur
lanu ldaber kakah (we are not allowed to talk like
this), this is because someone forbids us from talk-
ing, while if qale lrinah bah. ayim
(It is hard for Rina in life) then no ”outside force” is
obliged to be the agent which makes her life hard. To

as modals, and we recommend allowing modal tag-
ging for other possible adjectives in this syntactic
structure.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991088235294">
We recommend the introduction of a modal POS tag
in Hebrew, despite the fact that the set of criteria to
identify modal usage is a complex combination of
syntactic and morphological constraints. This class
covers as many as 3% of the tokens observed in our
corpus.
Our main motivation in introducing this tag in our
tagset is that the alternative (no modal tag) creates
confusion and disagreement: we have shown that
both traditional dictionaries and previous computa-
tional resources had a high level of disagreement
over the class of words we tag as modals. We have
confirmed that our guidelines can be applied consis-
tently by human taggers, with agreement level simi-
lar to the rest of the tokens (over 99% pairwise). We
have checked that our guidelines stand the test of the
most difficult disagreement types identified by tag-
gers, such as “care to” and “difficult for”.
Finally, the immediate context of modals includes
a high proportion of infinitive words. Infinitive
words in Hebrew are particularly ambiguous mor-
phologically, because they begin with the letter
l which is a formative letter, and often include the
analysis le+ participle, e.g. can be interpreted,
depending on context, as lismwr (to guard), le-
samur (to a guarded), or la-samur (to the guarded).
Other ambiguities might occur too, e.g., can be
interpreted as lasir (to sing), le-sir (to a song), or as
la-sir (to the song). We have measured that on aver-
age, infinitive verbs in our expanded corpus can be
analyzed in 4.9 distinct manners, whereas the overall
average for all word tokens is 2.65. The identifica-
tion of modals can serve as an anchor which helps
disambiguate neighboring infinitive words.

<abstract confidence="0.99744996969697">Computational linguistics methods are typically first developed and tested in English. When applied to other languages, assumptions from English data are often applied to the target language. One of the most common such assumptions is that a “standard” part-of-speech (POS) tagset can be used across languages with only slight variations. We discuss in this paper a specific issue related to the definition of a POS tagset for Modern Hebrew, as an example to clarify the method through which such variations can be defined. It is widely assumed that Hebrew has no syntactic category of modals. There is, however, an identified class of words which are modal-like in their semantics, and can be characterized through distinct syntactic and morphologic criteria. We have found wide disagreement among traditional dictionaries on the POS tag attributed to such words. We describe three main approaches when deciding how to tag such words in Hebrew. We illustrate the impact of selecting each of these approaches on agreement among human taggers, and on the accuracy of automatic POS taggers induced for each method. We finally recommend the use of a “modal” tag in Hebrew and provide detailed guidelines for this tag. Our overall conclusion is that tagset definition is a complex task which deserves appropriate methodology.</abstract>

To conclude this section, our proposed definition of modals allows us to tag this word in a systematic and complete manner and to avoid the confusion that characterizes this word. 3.2 ”It’s really hard” Some of the words tagged as modals are commonly referred to as adjectives, such as ’asur, mutar (allowed, forbidden), though everyone agrees - and tags these words as adverbs or participals (see table 1). However, questions are raised of how to tell apart modals as such from adjectives that show very similar properties: qase li laleket (it is hard for me to walk). Ambar (1995) analyzes the usage of adjectives in modal contexts, especially of ability and possibility. In sentences such as qale lanu lhistagel lara‘as (it is hard for us to get used to the noise) the adjective is used in a modal and not an adverbial meaning, in the sense that meaning of the adverbial bqwsi (with difficulty) and the modal yakwl (can) are unified into a single word .

The decision whether to introduce a modal tag in a Hebrew tagset has practical consequences: we counted that over 3% of the tokens in our 1M token corpus can potentially be tagged as modals. Beyond this practical impact, the decision process illustrates the relevant method through which a tagset can be derived and fine tuned. 2 Modality in Hebrew Semantically, Modus is considered to be the attitude on the part of the speaking subject with regard to its content (Ducrot and Todorov, 1972), as opposed to the Dictum which is the linguistic realization of a predicate. While a predicate is most commonly represented with a verb, modality can be uttered in various manners: adjectives and adverbs (definitely, probable), using thought/belief verbs, mood, intonation, or with modal verbs. The latter are recognized as a grammatical category in many languages (modals), e.g., can, should and must in English. From the semantic perspective, modality is coarsely divided into epistemic modality (the amount of confidence the speaker holds with reference to the truth of the proposition) and deon</context>

The latter are recognized as a grammatical category in many languages (modals), e.g., can, should and must in English. From the semantic perspective, modality is coarsely divided into epistemic modality (the amount of confidence the speaker holds with reference to the truth of the proposition) and deontic modality (the degree of force exerted on the subject of the sentence to perform the action) views (de Haan, 2005). Modal expressions do not constitute a syntactic class in Modern Hebrew (Kopelovich, 1982). In her work, Kopelovich reviews classic descriptive 58 Word Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 yes yes la´sim leb lanisuh R N N R N A R V should Attention should be paid to the wording ’ein ’ein la´sim leb lanisuh R U NR U P P R V shouldn’t Attention should not be paid to the wording hayab hacibur hayab lhabin ’et ha‘inyan J J J J J J J V must The public should be made aware of this issue mutar mutar lah lacet ltiyul R N J R J A V J allowed She is allowed to go on a trip ’asur ’asur lah lacet ltiyul byom rison R R R R J A J J forbidden She is not allowed to go on a trip on Sunday V ’epgr ’epsr lirmoz r</context>

Modulation participates in the content clause expressing external conditions in the world (deontic modality - permission, obligation, ability and inclination): ’ata yakol lhath. il ‘aksaw (you can start now). Modality does not carry tense and cannot be negated, while modulation can be modified by tense and can be negative. 3For reference see (Kopelovich, 1982), see below for Rosen’s analysis The Objective-Subjective plane is what Kopelovich calls the perception of the world. Objectivity is achieved using different tenses of to-be in conjunction with the modal (including tense of modal if it is a verb), and their order subjective vs. objective: (3) dawid haya carik lisw‘ ltel ’abib David was have to-drive to-Tel Aviv David had to drive to Tel Aviv (4) kdei lha‘abir ’et hahah. lata, carik haya lkanes ’et kol ha‘obdim In-order to-pass ACC the-decision, should to-assemble ACC all the-employees In order to obtain a favorable vote on this decision, all o</context>

But this criterion leaves out all of the genderquantity inflected words, e.g., ra’uy, msugal, ‘alul, ’amur, carik, yakol, which are all classified as modals by Zadka. On the other hand, including all the gender-quantity inflected words with infinite or relative clause complements as modals, will include certain adjectives, e.g., musmak (certified), nouns, e.g., zkut (credit), and participles, e.g., nimna‘ (avoid), as well. It appears that Zadka’s classification relies primarily on semantic criteria. Rosen (1977, pp. 113-115) defines a syntactic category he calls impersonals. Words in this category occur only as the predicative constituent of a sentence with an infinitive or a subordinate clause argument. Past and future tense is marked with the auxilary verb hayah (to-be). In addition, impersonals cannot function as predicative adjectives: kda’i (worthwhile), mutab (better), ’ikpat (care/mind). Personal reference can be added to the clause (governed by the infinitive) with the l dative preposition: (10) kda’y li liRot worthwhile to-me to-drink It is worthwhile for me to drink 2.1 Criteria to Identif</context>
