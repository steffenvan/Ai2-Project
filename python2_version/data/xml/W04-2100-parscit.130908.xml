A dictionary is a vital component of any natural language processing system. While
the digital form has a potential which has only been partially explored, seizing the
new possibilities requires some rethinking. This is the goal of this one-day workshop.
Creating, maintaining and exploiting intelligently a dictionary involves many skills,
some of which we still lack full understanding of. In order to get a clearer picture on
these, we’ve invited papers addressing any of the following issues :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9967386">
• type of information to be stored in the dictionary
• representation and structuring (indexing) of the data;
• management, visualization and useability of the data;
• access (aids for navigation, interface, strategies);
• acquisition of lexical data (corpus);
• possibilities for editing entries (annotation, updating);
• integration (combination of the dictionary with other ressources, writer’s
workbench);
• uses of dictionaries by people (learning/teaching; writing) and by machines
(NLP).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.978780277777778">
While we did not get papers on all these issues, we did get a quite good number
of papers on such divers issues as « design of a lexical database, standardization,
indexing, word access, corpus-based lexical resources, lexical interfaces, lexical
acquisition and formalization ». It was also interesting to see the variety of languages
in which these issues are addressed. The proposals range from Japanese, Sanskrit,
English, German, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, to French and Portuguese. In sum, the
community working on dictionaries is dynamic, and there seems to be a growing
awareness of the importance of some of the problems presented in our call for
papers.
Hoping to enrich the discussion by giving the greatest number of people a chance
to express their views, we have decided to accept next to the full papers (5) several
project notes (4) and abstracts (10).
Sincere thanks to all the specialists who helped us to assure a good selection of
papers, despite a very tight schedule. Their reviews were not only helpful for our
decision making, but also, so we believe, for the authors to improve their papers. In
the hope that their work interests you, provokes fruitful discussions and result in
future collaborations.
