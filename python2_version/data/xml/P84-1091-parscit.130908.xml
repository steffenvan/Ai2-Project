ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999654368421053">
The algorithm takes as only input a list of
words, preferably but not necessarily in phonemic
transcription, in any two putatively related
languages, and sorts it into decreasing order of
probable cognation. The processing of a 250-item
bilingual list takes about five seconds of CPU time
on a DEC KL1091, and requires 56 pages of core
memory. The algorithm is given no information
whatsoever about the phonemic transcription used,
and even though cognate identification is carried
out on the basis of a context-free one-for-one
mata/nas Titia &amp;quot;m&amp;quot; may correspond to Sese &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;,
or &amp;quot;s&amp;quot;, and so may Titia &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;t&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;s&amp;quot;.
We summarize the evidence for these
possible correspondences in an TxS matrix, where
T is the number of different characters found in
the Titia wordlist, S that in the Sese wordlist.
Thus the evidence afforded by the first pair,

maximum potential, 11.60, divided by the number of
correspondences, 4). Word pairs with high cognation
indices are found to be more often genetically
related than pairs with low cognation indices.

probability of the discrepancy between its observed
and expected frequencies of occurrence not being
due to chance, expressed as a z score. Where
absolute frequencies of 20 and less are involved
the exact probability is calculated and translated
into a z score using a polynomial approximation
(Abramowitz and Stegun 1970).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.483397">
B. Vowel/Consonant Correspondences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999437666666667">
Disallowing correspondences between vowels
and consonants vastly improved the performance of
the algorithm. No human intervention is needed to
identify vowels from consonants, an improved
version of an algorithm described in Suhotin 1962
being used to identify characters which represent
vowel sounds. Whether consonants should be allowed
to correspond to vowels is left as an option in the
current implementation.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.559714" genericHeader="method">
C. Iterations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998979375">
Performance is again improved when word
pairs showing individual character matches as
computed from matrices of potentials (section IB
above) are reprocessed. The weights of possible
character correspondences are recomputed. This
time, however, only characters in the same
positions in the two words are scored as possible
correspondences. Thus for instance, the first pass
of the algorithm having matched the &amp;quot;m&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;meta&amp;quot;
to the &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;nas&amp;quot;, Titia &amp;quot;m&amp;quot; is scored in the
second pass as corresponding possibly only to Sese
&amp;quot;n&amp;quot;. Sequences of alternate null correspondences
are collapsed so as not to preclude the
identification of correspondences which might have
been missed in the first pass, e.g. a pair mat/mot
matched in the first pass as

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992422323529412">
Weights of possible character correspon-
dences having thus been recomputed, a new matrix of
potentials and a new cognation index is computed
for each word pair. Further iterations were found
to yield negligible improvements to the results
obtained.
D. Improved Weights and Cognation Indices
Frequent character correspondences often
yield very high z scores (up to 18.2). The presence
of even one such high score in a word pair often
Invalidates the character-matching procedure. A
number of alternative alterations to the definition
of weight were tried, out of which the simplest
proved best: weights beyond an arbitrary value are
set to that value. Practice showed a maximum value
of 3.0 to 4.0 to give the best results. This is not
surprising, since there is no significant
difference in the degrees of certainty
corresponding to z scores of 4 and beyond.
The last improvement in the performance of
the algorithm to date was brought by a redefinition
of the cognation index. Once the individual
character matches of a word pair have been
identified from its matrix of potentials their
weights are adjusted as follows:
1) Positive weights less than 1.28 (corresponding
to a 90% significance level) are set to zero;
negative weights and weights greater than 1.28 are
left unchanged.
2) Positive weights of character-to-zero matches
are set to zero; negative weights are left
unchanged.
The cognation index is then defined as the
sum of the adjusted weights divided by the number

III PERFORMANCE OF THE ALGORITHM
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999412190476191">
The algorithm as described has been
implemented in Simula 67 on a DEC 11091 and
applied to a corpus of some 300 words in 75
languages and dialects of Vanuatu. Results are
excellent for languages sharing 40% or more
cognates, even when sound correspondences are
complex. They deteriorate rapidly when lesser
proportions of cognates and complex sound
correspondences are involved, but remain excellent
when mainly one-to-one correspondences are present.
Thus for instance Sakao and Tolomako (Espiritu
Santo, Vanuatu) were given as sharing 38.91%
cognates (cut-off cognation index: 1.28), as
against a human estimate of 41% backed by a full
knowledge of their diachronic phonologies and
comparisons with other related languages. Out of
the 50 word pairs with the highest cognation
indices only two (the 38th and the 45th) were
definitely not cognate and one (the 36th) doubtful.
Yet, Sakao has undergone extremely complex
phonological changes, viz.:

IV FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS

<bodyText confidence="0.996271">
The identification of environment-
conditioned phonological correspondences is the
next, most obvious stage in further improving the
algorithm. This problem has of course been, and is
being, investigated. Difficulties arise from the
fact that frequencies of possible correspondences
In any given environment become too low to be
handled by statistical tests. Other approaches --
inspired from chess-playing programs -- have been
tried, but have proved too expensive in computer
time so far. A further, much desirable, improvement
is the identification of rules of metathesis. The
solution to this problem appears to be subordinated
to that of the discovery of context-sensitive
rules.

V PURPOSE OF THE ALGORITHM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.809761681818182">
A bilingual wordlist is conceptually
equivalent to a bilingual text: words of a list to
sentences of a text, phonemes of a word to
morphemes of a sentence, cognate pairs to segments
of the same meaning, non-cognates to segments of
different meanings, and the algorithm described is
the present state of an attempted solution to the
much more general following problem: given two
texts of approximately equal lengths in two
different languages, determine whether one is the
translation of the other -- or both translations of
a text in a third language -- wholly or in parts,
and if so, establish the rules for translating one
into the other.

Other approaches -inspired from chess-playing programs -have been tried, but have proved too expensive in computer time so far. A further, much desirable, improvement is the identification of rules of metathesis. The solution to this problem appears to be subordinated to that of the discovery of context-sensitive rules. V PURPOSE OF THE ALGORITHM A bilingual wordlist is conceptually equivalent to a bilingual text: words of a list to sentences of a text, phonemes of a word to morphemes of a sentence, cognate pairs to segments of the same meaning, non-cognates to segments of different meanings, and the algorithm described is the present state of an attempted solution to the much more general following problem: given two texts of approximately equal lengths in two different languages, determine whether one is the translation of the other -or both translations of a text in a third language -wholly or in parts, and if so, establish the rules for translating one into the other.
