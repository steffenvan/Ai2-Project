This paper describes a model that has been de-
veloped in the Turgama Project at Leiden Uni-
versity to meet the challenges encountered in
the computational analysis of ancient Syriac
Biblical manuscripts. The small size of the
corpus, the absence of native speakers, and the
variation attested in the multitude of textual
witnesses require a model of encoding—rather
than tagging—that moves from the formal dis-
tributional registration of linguistic elements
to functional deductions. The model is illumi-
nated by an example from verb inflection. It
shows how a corpus-based analysis can im-
prove upon the inflectional paradigms given in
traditional grammars and how the various or-
thographic representations can be accounted
for by an encoding system that registers both
the paradigmatic forms and their attested reali-
zations.

1.1 Challenges
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988954">
If we wish to make a linguistic analysis of an-
cient texts, in our case the Hebrew Bible and its
Syriac translation, the Peshitta (ca. 2nd century
CE), we are confronted with a number of chal-
lenges:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990042789473684">
• There is no native speaker of the lan-
guages involved. We do not know in ad-
vance what categories are relevant in the
linguistic analysis, what functions a cer-
tain construction has, or what functional
oppositions there exist in the language
system. For this reason we should avoid as
much as we can any model that presup-
poses knowledge about the language.
• We have only written sources. Hence we
are challenged by the complex interaction
between orthographic conventions and
morphological phenomena. There are even
some orthographic practices which, it is
claimed, have never been supported by a
phonological or morphological realization
(see section 4.5).
• We are dealing with multiple unique
documents. In philology, the text of the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.825628142857143">
Hebrew Bible or its Syriac translation is
an abstract notion, a scholarly construct.
The corpus that we enter into our database
consists of the concrete witnesses to the
abstract text. Textual variants provide use-
ful information about language variation
and development (section 4.5).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.600368833333333">
• We are dealing with a small corpus. The
Hebrew Bible contains about 300.000–
400.000 words (depending on whether we
count graphic words or functional words);
the vocabulary consists of about 8.000 lex-
emes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999777875">
Moreover, because of the context in which our
research takes place, at the boundary of linguis-
tics and philology, our aim is the construction of
a database with a correctly encoded text. Because
we want to understand the text, rather than
merely collect knowledge about the language
system, we have set high standards of accuracy
for the encoding of the text.

1.2 Dilemmas
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999725">
These challenges lead to the following dilemmas
for the computational analysis of ancient texts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991681">
• Data-oriented or theory-driven? Since

knowledge are problematic, we want to be

data-oriented, rather than theory-driven.
However, approaches that merely try to
extract knowledge from the corpus with a
minimum of human input are insufficient
because of the size of our corpus and be-
cause we want knowledge about the text,
not just about the language.
• Priority for the corpus or the language?
Due to the lack of native speakers, the sole
basis for our knowledge about the lan-
guage is the corpus, but, at the same time,
the corpus can only be accessed through
some linguistic knowledge and some basic
understanding of the text. We cannot start
from scratch, avoiding any preliminary
understanding of the text, its language, its
features, and its meaning. This under-
standing is shaped by our scholarly and
cultural tradition. It is based on transmit-
ted knowledge. But we have to find ways
in which the computational analysis does
not only imitate or repeat traditional inter-
pretations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.848126">
1.3 Requirements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995095238095">
The challenges and dilemmas mentioned above
require a model that is deductive rather than in-
ductive; that goes from form (the concrete tex-
tual data) to function (the categories that we do
not know a priori); that entails registering the
distribution of linguistic elements, rather than
merely adding functional labels—in other words,
that involves encoding rather than tagging; that
registers both the paradigmatic forms and their
realizations; that allows grammatical categories
and formal descriptions to be redefined on the
basis of corpus analysis; and that involves inter-
active analytical procedures, which are needed
for the level of accuracy we aim for.
In the distributional analysis at word level, for
example, we mark prefixes and suffixes, rather
than tagging a form as “imperfect 2ms” etc.
Similarly on clause level we identify patterns
such as “subject + participle + complement”, as
against the usual practice of giving functional
clause labels such as “circumstantial clause”.

2 Analytical procedure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999657">
In our project the analysis of Hebrew and Syriac
involves a bottom-up linguistic analysis at the
following levels:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994928">
2.1 Word level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986">
This level concerns the segmentation of words
into morphemes, the functional deductions from
the morphological analysis, and the assignment
of lexically determined word functions. It will be
described in detail in section 3.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999042">
2.2 Phrase level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958833333333">
At this level words are combined into phrases
(e.g. noun + adjective). This entails the morpho-
syntactic analysis and the systematic adaptations
of word classes in certain environments (e.g. ad-
jective → noun), and the analysis of phrase-
internal relations (e.g. apposition).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997991">
2.3 Clause level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986825">
This level concerns the combination of phrases
into clauses (e.g. conjunction + VP + determinate
NP), and the assignment of syntactic functions
(e.g. subject, predicate).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992411">
2.4 Text level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995175">
This level concerns the determination of the rela-
tionships between clauses and the assignment of
the syntactical functions of the clauses within the
text hierarchy (e.g. object clause).
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.891852" genericHeader="method">
3 Workflow of word-level analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998724">
In the following discussion we will restrict our-
selves to the morphological analysis. At the
higher linguistic levels the same principles are
applied, although the consequences are some-
what different (see section 5).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999789">
3.1 Running text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999754">
As an example we take the Syriac translation
(Peshitta) of the book of Judges. The starting-
point of the analysis is a transliterated running
text, called P_Judges, which reflects the Leiden
Peshitta edition. Sample 1 contains the first verse
of this text. The variant notation between square
brackets indicates that the first word, whw&apos;, ‘and
it happened’, is missing in a number of manu-
scripts. Between the angle brackets a comment
has been added.
Even this first step involves a number of dis-
ambiguating decisions, for example, as to
whether a dot above a letter is a vowel sign, a
delimitation marker, or just a spot in the manu-
script.1

The program pil2wit transforms the running text
into the so-called graphic text, a transliterated
text according to an established format that en-
ables the subsequent steps in the analysis (sam-
ple 2). It has another transliteration system;2 in-
structions to select variants have been executed;
comments have been omitted; and the markers of
book, chapter and verse have been added.

The grapic text is the input file for the program
Analyse, which concerns the segmentation of the
Syriac words into morphemes (as far as concate-
native morphemes are involved3). For this seg-
mentation we use a system of encoding, rather
than tagging. Thus the imperfect form neqtol “he
will kill” is encoded as !N!QV&amp;WL[, in which
the exclamation marks !...! indicate the prefix,
the ampersand &amp; a paradigmatically unexpected
letter—the round bracket ( indicates an expected
but absent letter—and the square bracket to the
right [ a verbal ending. Sample 3 provides the
interface in the interactive procedure of Analyse.

vious analyses (sample 4).

<bodyText confidence="0.999915208333333">
It appears, for example, that up to the moment
that sample 4 was extracted from the lexicon, the
form WCLX had received two different encodings
(lines 9310 and 9311; see below, section 4.3).
The human researcher has to accept or reject
the proposals made by Analyse or to add a new
analysis. We cannot go through all details, but in
the second line of sample 4, for example, a
choice has to be made between the preposition
men (MN) and the interrogative pronoun man
(MN=; the disambiguating function of the equals
sign is recorded in the lexicon [section 3.6],
where both MN and MN= are defined). Likewise,
in the case of &lt;BDH, the human researcher has to
decide whether this is a verb (hence the verbal
ending [), the noun ‘servant’ (&lt;BD=), or the
noun ‘work’ (&lt;BD==).
For these disambiguating decisions in the in-
teractive procedure the human researcher follows
a protocol that describes the relative weight of
diacritical dots in the oldest manuscripts, the
vowel signs that are added in some manuscripts,
the vocalization in printed editions, and gram-
matical and contextual considerations.

masculine (2); and the notion of ‘state’ does not
apply to it (-1), because this notion is only used
in the case of nominal endings.

4 This column comes from an earlier phase of our
project. In our present encoding the value is always
‘inapplicable’ (-1), because we now treat the suffix

appears from its own grammatical functions, which
are different from those of the word to which it is at-

3.10 Relation with requirements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999297411764706">
Some typical features of the workflow serve to
meet the requirements defined in section 1.3. The
procedure of encoding rather than tagging guar-
antees consistency in the analysis of morphemes,
because the functional deductions are produced
automatically. It has the advantage that not only
the interpretation of a word, but also the data
which led to a certain interpretation can be re-
trieved, whereas the motivation behind a tagging
is usually not visible. It also has the advantage
that both the surface forms and the functional
analysis are preserved.
By using the language-specific auxiliary files
we take our starting-point in the scholarly tradi-
tion of Semitic studies, but the encoding system
allows us to test alternative interpretations of the
data (see below, section 4.5).

Since we work with real manuscripts, we have to
deal with the forms that are actually attested. As
appears from the paradigm in table 2, for exam-
ple, the perfect 3mp sometimes has no verbal
ending. What is not recorded in the traditional
grammars is that there are also forms 3ms with
the ending -w. This may be due to the fact that
the -w in the plural, even if it were represented in
writing, was not pronounced.5 Traditionally the
5 Admittedly, it can be problematic to make claims
about the pronunciation on the basis of written
sources, but there are strong arguments for this claim,
singular forms with -w are taken as errors, due to
the confusion with the silent -w in the plural.
The Leiden Peshitta edition takes such read-
ings as ‘orthographic variants’. They do not ap-
pear in the critical apparatus to the text, but in a
separate Index Orthographicus. The general pref-
ace to the edition contains a long list of catego-
ries of orthographical variation (cf. sample 15).

As we said above, the square bracket to the right

coding in table 3 implies that we take the verbal

tional -n. Alternatively we could decide to intro-
duce a separate morpheme -wn besides -w. The
equals sign is used for the disambiguation of
forms that have the same consonantal representa-
tion. We use it to distinguish the three verbal
endings -t and for distinguishing the -y of the
perfect 3fs from the -y of the imperative 3fs.
A round bracket marks a paradigmatically ex-
pected but absent letter. Thus we have taken the
imperfect form 3fs KTBJ as the paradigmatic
form, although KTB occurs as well.

To deal with this material in an appropriate way
it is important to use an encoding system in
which both the attested surface forms and the
abstract morphemes can be retrieved. Thus
’wqdw ‘they burnt (it)’ (Judges 1:8; our tran-
scription: &gt;WQDW) is a form of the verb yqd
(JQD), with the causative prefix ’- (&gt;). We mark
the causative stem morpheme with two square
brackets to the left (cf. sample 8), indicate with
the round bracket to the right that the first letter
of the lexeme is absent, and mark with the am-
persand the w that has come instead. The square
bracket to the right marks the verbal ending. This
results in the following encoding:

<bodyText confidence="0.999758764705882">
This way of encoding the verb forms attested in
multiple textual witnesses provides us with a
large database from which language variation
data can be retrieved. In some cases language
development is involved as well, and the data
can be used for diachronic analysis. For this re-
search we can build upon the work done by the
Syriac scholar Sebastian Brock. One of the phe-
nomena Brock (2003:99–100) observed was that
in West Syriac Biblical manuscripts some ortho-
graphic innovations are attested, including the
addition of a -y to the perfect 3fp, the imperfect
3fs and, on analogy, the perfect 3fs. It is a de-
bated issue whether this ending reflects a mor-
pheme that was once pronounced (thus Boyarin,
1981) or just an orthographic convention (thus
Brock, 2003; cf. Van Peursen, 2008:244).

4.6 An experiment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999853193548387">
Our approach enables us to deploy a practice that
is completely new in Syriac scholarship, namely
the possibility of testing assumptions upon the
data (cf. Talstra &amp; Dyk, 2006). We can test, for
example, what happens if we redefine the distri-
bution of ktb and ktbw (cf. section 4.2) and take
the zero ending and the -w as allomorphs for the
3rd person masculine.
In our model such a reinterpretation of the ma-
terial can be registered formally by changing the
relevant sections in the Word Grammar. Since
the lemmatization is done automatically on the
basis of the morphologically encoded text and a
functional description of the morphemes, there is
no need to change the lemmatization in all sepa-
rate instances manually.
We have done this experiment for Judges 1 in
nineteen manuscripts. This chapter contains 54
perfect forms 3m (except for third-weak verbs).
In the bottom-up analysis (cf. section 2) the ef-
fect is that the decision on whether a 3m verb is
singular or plural is not taken at word level, but
at a later stage of the procedure, in which the
verb is matched with a subject or another ele-
ment that reveals its number.
At first sight the results of our experiment
were not exciting. In those 26 cases where the
grammatical number of the subject is unambigu-
ous, the ‘regular’ forms are dominant: Only three
times is there an irregular form (singular ktbw or
plural ktb), once in one manuscript, twice in two
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999639023255814">
manuscripts.6 Nevertheless, our experiment
yielded some interesting observations.
In the first place we discovered that in 28
cases the grammatical number remained am-
biguous even in the clause-level analysis because
the subject was a collective noun (which in
Syriac can take either a singular or a plural).
In these ambiguous cases the traditional analy-
sis of ktb as a singular and ktbw as a plural im-
plies a striking alternation of singular and plural
forms, e.g. 1:10 ‘and Judah went (w’zl, singular)
... and [they] killed (wqtlw, plural)’. In our ex-
periment, this became mere orthographic varia-
tion. Consequently, in the final stage of the bot-
tom-up analytical procedure, the text hierarchical
analysis (section 2.4), we arrived at a more ele-
gant text hierarchical structure, because many of
the recurrent subject changes caused by the sin-
gular/plural alternation had been resolved.
Secondly, the experiment overcame the rather
arbitrary division between ‘real’ and ortho-
graphic variants in the Leiden Peshitta edition. In
this edition, whenever there may be some doubt
as to whether the verb is in the singular or in the
plural, variation between ktb and ktbw forms is
taken as ‘real’ and the variant is included in the
critical apparatus; whenever there is no doubt,
the variation is considered orthographic and the
variant is listed in the Index Orthographicus
(sample edition and vol. IV/6) or not mentioned
at all (other volumes; cf. Dirksen, 1972:vii-ix).
This editorial policy leads to the somewhat ar-
bitrary decision that nht ‘descended’ in 1:9 (Ms
16c1, 16g3; other manuscripts: nhtw) is an or-
thographic variant, because the subject is the plu-
ral bny yhwd’ ‘sons of Judah, Judahites’, whereas
in 1:10, where the subject is just yhwd’ ‘Judah’,
’zlw ‘went’ (Ms 17a3; other manuscripts: ’zl) is a
real variant. In 1:26, the same form ’zlw (Ms
19c1; other manuscripts have again ’zl) is taken
as orthographic, because the subject is the singu-
lar noun gbr’ ‘(the) man’. In our experiment all
these variant readings are treated equally.

We hope to have shown how the analytical pro-
cedure (section 2) and the workflow of the word-
level analysis (section 3) meet the challenges of
working with ancient documents (section 1), due
to their form-to-function approach, their use of
encoding rather than tagging, their distinction

between paradigmatic forms and their realiza-
tions, and because of the exigencies of accuracy
in the case of an ancient limited corpus.
In the word-level analysis we lean heavily on
existing grammars. For that reason our approach
could be regarded as theory-driven, even though
we consider it one of our main tasks to revise and
refine the paradigm on the basis of the actual
corpora. Our encodings should be considered as
hypotheses about the data that can be subjected
to testing and experiment (section 4.6).
Unlike projects that concern the acceleration
of POS tagging (Ringger et al., 2007; Caroll et
al., 2007) we start one level below, with the
morphology. ‘Encoding rather than tagging’ is
not just a practical, but a crucial methodological
characteristic of our model. (For new insights
that it produced regarding Syriac morphology see
the publications by Bakker, Van Keulen and Van
Peursen in the bibliography). We differ from the
computer implementation of morphological rules
(Kiraz, 2001) in that our work is more deductive
and focused on the interaction between orthogra-
phy and morphology, because we start with the
actual forms attested in the manuscripts. Our po-
sition in relation to these other projects is mainly
determined by the philological demands that di-
rect our research (see section 1).
Whereas at the morphological level the infor-
mation provided by traditional grammars is rela-
tively stable, at the higher linguistic levels they
provide much less solid ground. The gradually
built up datasets (analogous to the Analytical
Lexicon at word level) of phrase patterns, clause
patterns, or verbal valence contain much infor-
mation that is not properly dealt with in tradi-
tional grammars. At these levels the analysis be-
comes more data-oriented. Thus in the analysis
of phrase structure Van Peursen (2007) found
many complex patterns that have not been dealt
with in traditional grammars.
We have taken our examples from Syriac, but
the same analytical procedures have been applied
to other forms of Aramaic (Biblical Aramaic and
Targum Aramaic) and Biblical Hebrew. Because
of the separation of the analytical programs and
the language-specific auxiliary files, it should be
possible to apply it to other languages as well.
This would mainly require writing the appropri-
ate language definition files. Although our model
is in principle language-independent, the mor-
phological analysis presented in this paper is es-
pecially apt for Semitic languages because of
their rich morphology.

<abstract confidence="0.998651066985646">This paper describes a model that has been developed in the Turgama Project at Leiden University to meet the challenges encountered in the computational analysis of ancient Syriac Biblical manuscripts. The small size of the corpus, the absence of native speakers, and the variation attested in the multitude of textual witnesses require a model of encoding—rather than tagging—that moves from the formal distributional registration of linguistic elements to functional deductions. The model is illuminated by an example from verb inflection. It shows how a corpus-based analysis can improve upon the inflectional paradigms given in traditional grammars and how the various orthographic representations can be accounted for by an encoding system that registers both the paradigmatic forms and their attested realizations. 1 Working with ancient documents 1.1 Challenges If we wish to make a linguistic analysis of ancient texts, in our case the Hebrew Bible and its Syriac translation, the Peshitta (ca. 2nd century CE), we are confronted with a number of challenges: • There is no native speaker of the languages involved. We do not know in advance what categories are relevant in the linguistic analysis, what functions a certain construction has, or what functional oppositions there exist in the language system. For this reason we should avoid as much as we can any model that presupposes knowledge about the language. • We have only written sources. Hence we are challenged by the complex interaction between orthographic conventions and morphological phenomena. There are even some orthographic practices which, it is claimed, have never been supported by a phonological or morphological realization (see section 4.5). • We are dealing with multiple unique In philology, of the Hebrew Bible or its Syriac translation is an abstract notion, a scholarly construct. The corpus that we enter into our database of the concrete the abstract text. Textual variants provide useful information about language variation and development (section 4.5). • We are dealing with a small corpus. The Hebrew Bible contains about 300.000– 400.000 words (depending on whether we count graphic words or functional words); the vocabulary consists of about 8.000 lexemes. Moreover, because of the context in which our research takes place, at the boundary of linguistics and philology, our aim is the construction of a database with a correctly encoded text. Because we want to understand the text, rather than merely collect knowledge about the language system, we have set high standards of accuracy for the encoding of the text. 1.2 Dilemmas These challenges lead to the following dilemmas for the computational analysis of ancient texts: • Data-oriented or theory-driven? Since approaches that presuppose linguistic knowledge are problematic, we want to be of the EACL 2009 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic pages Greece, 31 March, 2009. Association for Computational Linguistics 1 data-oriented, rather than theory-driven. However, approaches that merely try to extract knowledge from the corpus with a minimum of human input are insufficient because of the size of our corpus and because we want knowledge about the text, not just about the language. • Priority for the corpus or the language? Due to the lack of native speakers, the sole basis for our knowledge about the language is the corpus, but, at the same time, the corpus can only be accessed through some linguistic knowledge and some basic understanding of the text. We cannot start from scratch, avoiding any preliminary understanding of the text, its language, its features, and its meaning. This understanding is shaped by our scholarly and cultural tradition. It is based on transmitted knowledge. But we have to find ways in which the computational analysis does not only imitate or repeat traditional interpretations. 1.3 Requirements The challenges and dilemmas mentioned above require a model that is deductive rather than inductive; that goes from form (the concrete textual data) to function (the categories that we do not know a priori); that entails registering the distribution of linguistic elements, rather than merely adding functional labels—in other words, that involves encoding rather than tagging; that registers both the paradigmatic forms and their realizations; that allows grammatical categories and formal descriptions to be redefined on the basis of corpus analysis; and that involves interactive analytical procedures, which are needed for the level of accuracy we aim for. In the distributional analysis at word level, for example, we mark prefixes and suffixes, rather than tagging a form as “imperfect 2ms” etc. Similarly on clause level we identify patterns such as “subject + participle + complement”, as against the usual practice of giving functional clause labels such as “circumstantial clause”. 2 Analytical procedure In our project the analysis of Hebrew and Syriac involves a bottom-up linguistic analysis at the following levels: 2.1 Word level This level concerns the segmentation of words into morphemes, the functional deductions from the morphological analysis, and the assignment of lexically determined word functions. It will be described in detail in section 3. 2.2 Phrase level At this level words are combined into phrases (e.g. noun + adjective). This entails the morphosyntactic analysis and the systematic adaptations of word classes in certain environments (e.g. adand the analysis of phraseinternal relations (e.g. apposition). 2.3 Clause level This level concerns the combination of phrases into clauses (e.g. conjunction + VP + determinate NP), and the assignment of syntactic functions (e.g. subject, predicate). 2.4 Text level This level concerns the determination of the relationships between clauses and the assignment of the syntactical functions of the clauses within the text hierarchy (e.g. object clause). 3 Workflow of word-level analysis In the following discussion we will restrict ourselves to the morphological analysis. At the higher linguistic levels the same principles are applied, although the consequences are somewhat different (see section 5). 3.1 Running text As an example we take the Syriac translation (Peshitta) of the book of Judges. The startingpoint of the analysis is a transliterated running text, called P_Judges, which reflects the Leiden Peshitta edition. Sample 1 contains the first verse of this text. The variant notation between square indicates that the first word, ‘and it happened’, is missing in a number of manuscripts. Between the angle brackets a comment has been added. Even this first step involves a number of disambiguating decisions, for example, as to whether a dot above a letter is a vowel sign, a delimitation marker, or just a spot in the manu- 1One has to take similar decisions if one text of a manuscript to Unicode, because the of the Unicode characters include both a for- 2 1 [whw&apos;/ -6h7, 8a1c, 10c1, 11c1, 12a1fam] &lt;check reading in 6h7&gt; mn btr dmyt y$w` brnwn `bdh dmry&apos;; 1 $&apos;lw bn:y &apos;ysryl bmry&apos; w&apos;mr:yn; mnw nsq ln `l kn`n:y&apos; bry$&apos;; lmtkt$w `mhwn Sample 1: P_Judges (running text) 3.2 Production of graphic text (‘pil2wit’) The program pil2wit transforms the running text into the so-called graphic text, a transliterated text according to an established format that enables the subsequent steps in the analysis (sam- 2).

The condition is phrased as a Boolean expression yielding true or false indicating whether the condition is met or not. If the condition is met, the listed actions are undertaken. An action is usually the assignment of a value to a word function, but can also involve accepting or rejecting a form, or jumping to a rule further down. Thus the rule 4 vbe == &amp;quot;W&amp;quot; .. gn=m, nu=pl be read as: is a verbal ending assign the values gender = masculine and number = plural. 3.8 Result: the ps2 file The result is a ps2 file. Each row contains a verse reference, the lexeme, and a list of lexical and morphological features such as the lexical set, part of speech, verbal prefix, verbal stem, verbal ending, nominal ending, verbal tense, person, number, gender, nominal state. Thus the second line of sample 12 shows that the second word of is ‘to be’, which has the lexical set of existence’ it has the part of speech it has no verbal prefix it comes the simple verbal stem Peal or Qal it an empty verbal ending it has no nomiending it is a perfect form 3rd person singular without personal suffix and the notion of ‘state’ does not to it because this notion is only used in the case of nominal endings. 01,01 W 0 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 01,01 HWJ -2 1 0 0 1 0 -1 2 3 1 2 -1 01,01 MN 0 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 01,01 BTR 0 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 01,01 D -1 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 01,01 MWT 0 1 0 0 1 0 -1 2 3 1 2 -1 01,01 JCW&lt; 0 3 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1 0 2 2 01,01 BR 0 2 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1 0 2 0 01,01 NWN= 0 3 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1 0 2 2 Sample 12: P_Judices.ps2 From this file two files are automatically generated: an encoded surface text (xxx.ct) and a data description in human readable form (xxx.dmp). 4This column comes from an earlier phase of our project. In our present encoding the value is always because we now treat the suffix pronoun as an independent lexeme. Its lexeme status appears from its own grammatical functions, which are different from those of the word to which it is attached. The traditional lexicographical practice, however, does not treat it as a lexeme (Sikkel, 2008).

The procedure of encoding rather than tagging guarantees consistency in the analysis of morphemes, because the functional deductions are produced automatically. It has the advantage that not only the interpretation of a word, but also the data which led to a certain interpretation can be retrieved, whereas the motivation behind a tagging is usually not visible. It also has the advantage that both the surface forms and the functional analysis are preserved. By using the language-specific auxiliary files we take our starting-point in the scholarly tradition of Semitic studies, but the encoding system allows us to test alternative interpretations of the data (see below, section 4.5). 4 The verbal paradigm 4.1 Traditional grammars We will now illuminate our model by taking a look at the verbal paradigm. For the moment we will restrict ourselves to the paradigm of the suffix conjugation. In the traditional grammars we find the following inflection paradigm: singular plural 3 m – w [silent] – wn 3 f t – y [silent] 2 m t twn 2 f ty tyn 1 c t n nn Table 2: Paradigm of the perfect in Classical Syriac according to traditional grammars 4.2 Manuscript evidence Since we work with real manuscripts, we have to deal with the forms that are actually attested. As appears from the paradigm in table 2, for example, the perfect 3mp sometimes has no verbal ending. What is not recorded in the traditional grammars is that there are also forms 3ms with ending This may be due to the fact that the plural, even if it were represented in was not Traditionally the 5Admittedly, it can be problematic to make claims about the pronunciation on the basis of written sources, but there are strong arguments for this claim, forms with taken as errors, due to confusion with the silent the plural. The Leiden Peshitta edition takes such readings as ‘orthographic variants’. They do not appear in the critical apparatus to the text, but in a The general preface to the edition contains a long list of categories of orthographical variation (cf. sample 15). 2.2 varietates inflectionis 2.2.1 afformativa 2.2.1.1 perfectum 3 msg + f.sg m.sg + f.sg yodh m.pl waw f.pl + f. pl + pl cum des etc., etc. Sample 15: Excerpt from General Preface of Leiden Edition: categories of Orthographicus categories are referred to in the Oreach volume. Thus we find in the text of Song of Songs in the sample edition: 2.2 varietates flectionis: afformativa f. sg + 9l2 16g6 19 &lt; ?a1 f. pl. yodh (I); 10m1.3 11m1.2.4-6 13m1 17a1.2.4.5.10 18h3 13c1 15a2 17g2.6 17h2 18h3 16: Excerpt from Orthographicus Song of Songs in sample volume of Leiden Peshitta edition Unfortunately, the Peshitta project soon abanthe inclusion of the It appears only in the sample edition and one other volume (Vol. IV/6, containing Odes, the Prayer of Manasseh, Apocryphal Psalms, Psalms of Solomon, Tobit and 1(3) Esdras). including the fact that the final letter is ignored in punctuation, that it is frequently omitted in writing (Nöldeke, 2001:§50), and that it does not affect poetic patterns (Brockelmann, 1960:45). 6 4.3 Encoding the attested forms In the word-level analysis (cf. section 2.1) the forms listed in table 2 are encoded as follows: singular plural 3m KTB[ KTB[W KTB[(W KTB[W&amp;N 3f KTB[T== KTB[(J= KTB[J= 2m KTB[T= KTB[TWN 2f KTB[TJ KTB[TJN 1c KTB[T KTB[N KTB[N&amp;N Table 3: Encoded forms of Classical Syriac perfect As we said above, the square bracket to the right marks the verbal ending and the ampersand a paradigmatically unexpected letter. Thus our encoding in table 3 implies that we take the verbal an allomorph of an addi- Alternatively we could decide to introa separate morpheme The equals sign is used for the disambiguation of forms that have the same consonantal representation. We use it to distinguish the three verbal for distinguishing the the 3fs from the the imperative 3fs. A round bracket marks a paradigmatically expected but absent letter. Thus we have taken the form 3fs the paradigmatic although as well. 4.4 Paradigmatic forms and their realizations To deal with this material in an appropriate way it is important to use an encoding system in which both the attested surface forms and the abstract morphemes can be retrieved. Thus burnt (it)’ (Judges 1:8; our tranis a form of the verb with the causative prefix We mark the causative stem morpheme with two square brackets to the left (cf. sample 8), indicate with the round bracket to the right that the first letter of the lexeme is absent, and mark with the amthe has come instead. The square bracket to the right marks the verbal ending. This results in the following encoding: Encoding: ]&gt;](J&amp;WQD[W Paradigmatic forms: &gt; JQD W Realizations: &gt; WQD W 4.5 Language variation and language development This way of encoding the verb forms attested in multiple textual witnesses provides us with a large database from which language variation data can be retrieved. In some cases language development is involved as well, and the data can be used for diachronic analysis. For this research we can build upon the work done by the Syriac scholar Sebastian Brock. One of the phenomena Brock (2003:99–100) observed was that in West Syriac Biblical manuscripts some orthographic innovations are attested, including the of a the perfect 3fp, the imperfect 3fs and, on analogy, the perfect 3fs. It is a debated issue whether this ending reflects a morpheme that was once pronounced (thus Boyarin, 1981) or just an orthographic convention (thus Brock, 2003; cf. Van Peursen, 2008:244). 4.6 An experiment Our approach enables us to deploy a practice that is completely new in Syriac scholarship, namely the possibility of testing assumptions upon the data (cf. Talstra &amp; Dyk, 2006). We can test, for example, what happens if we redefine the distriof section 4.2) and take zero ending and the allomorphs for the 3rd person masculine. In our model such a reinterpretation of the material can be registered formally by changing the relevant sections in the Word Grammar. Since the lemmatization is done automatically on the basis of the morphologically encoded text and a functional description of the morphemes, there is no need to change the lemmatization in all separate instances manually. We have done this experiment for Judges 1 in nineteen manuscripts. This chapter contains 54 perfect forms 3m (except for third-weak verbs). In the bottom-up analysis (cf. section 2) the effect is that the decision on whether a 3m verb is singular or plural is not taken at word level, but at a later stage of the procedure, in which the verb is matched with a subject or another element that reveals its number. At first sight the results of our experiment were not exciting. In those 26 cases where the grammatical number of the subject is unambiguous, the ‘regular’ forms are dominant: Only three is there an irregular form (singular once in one manuscript, twice in two 7 Nevertheless, our experiment yielded some interesting observations. In the first place we discovered that in 28 cases the grammatical number remained ambiguous even in the clause-level analysis because the subject was a collective noun (which in Syriac can take either a singular or a plural). In these ambiguous cases the traditional analyof a singular and a plural implies a striking alternation of singular and plural e.g. 1:10 ‘and Judah went singular) and [they] plural)’. In our experiment, this became mere orthographic variation. Consequently, in the final stage of the bottom-up analytical procedure, the text hierarchical analysis (section 2.4), we arrived at a more elegant text hierarchical structure, because many of the recurrent subject changes caused by the singular/plural alternation had been resolved. Secondly, the experiment overcame the rather arbitrary division between ‘real’ and orthographic variants in the Leiden Peshitta edition. In this edition, whenever there may be some doubt as to whether the verb is in the singular or in the variation between is taken as ‘real’ and the variant is included in the critical apparatus; whenever there is no doubt, the variation is considered orthographic and the is listed in the Orthographicus (sample edition and vol. IV/6) or not mentioned at all (other volumes; cf. Dirksen, 1972:vii-ix). This editorial policy leads to the somewhat ardecision that in 1:9 (Ms 16g3; other manuscripts: is an orthographic variant, because the subject is the pluyhwd’ of Judah, Judahites’, whereas 1:10, where the subject is just (Ms 17a3; other manuscripts: is a variant. In 1:26, the same form other manuscripts have again is taken as orthographic, because the subject is the singunoun man’. In our experiment all these variant readings are treated equally. 5 Conclusions We hope to have shown how the analytical procedure (section 2) and the workflow of the wordlevel analysis (section 3) meet the challenges of working with ancient documents (section 1), due to their form-to-function approach, their use of encoding rather than tagging, their distinction 626 forms manuscripts = 494 forms in all the together. Accordingly, the 5 irregular forms make up 1%. between paradigmatic forms and their realizations, and because of the exigencies of accuracy in the case of an ancient limited corpus. In the word-level analysis we lean heavily on existing grammars. For that reason our approach could be regarded as theory-driven, even though we consider it one of our main tasks to revise and refine the paradigm on the basis of the actual corpora. Our encodings should be considered as hypotheses about the data that can be subjected to testing and experiment (section 4.6). Unlike projects that concern the acceleration POS tagging (Ringger al., Caroll 2007) we start one level below, with the morphology. ‘Encoding rather than tagging’ is not just a practical, but a crucial methodological characteristic of our model. (For new insights that it produced regarding Syriac morphology see the publications by Bakker, Van Keulen and Van Peursen in the bibliography). We differ from the computer implementation of morphological rules (Kiraz, 2001) in that our work is more deductive and focused on the interaction between orthography and morphology, because we start with the actual forms attested in the manuscripts. Our position in relation to these other projects is mainly determined by the philological demands that direct our research (see section 1). Whereas at the morphological level the information provided by traditional grammars is relatively stable, at the higher linguistic levels they provide much less solid ground. The gradually built up datasets (analogous to the Analytical Lexicon at word level) of phrase patterns, clause patterns, or verbal valence contain much information that is not properly dealt with in traditional grammars. At these levels the analysis becomes more data-oriented. Thus in the analysis of phrase structure Van Peursen (2007) found many complex patterns that have not been dealt with in traditional grammars. We have taken our examples from Syriac, but the same analytical procedures have been applied to other forms of Aramaic (Biblical Aramaic and Targum Aramaic) and Biblical Hebrew. Because of the separation of the analytical programs and the language-specific auxiliary files, it should be possible to apply it to other languages as well. This would mainly require writing the appropriate language definition files. Although our model is in principle language-independent, the morphological analysis presented in this paper is especially apt for Semitic languages because of their rich morphology.</abstract>

Secondly, the experiment overcame the rather arbitrary division between ‘real’ and orthographic variants in the Leiden Peshitta edition. In this edition, whenever there may be some doubt as to whether the verb is in the singular or in the plural, variation between ktb and ktbw forms is taken as ‘real’ and the variant is included in the critical apparatus; whenever there is no doubt, the variation is considered orthographic and the variant is listed in the Index Orthographicus (sample edition and vol. IV/6) or not mentioned at all (other volumes; cf. Dirksen, 1972:vii-ix). This editorial policy leads to the somewhat arbitrary decision that nht ‘descended’ in 1:9 (Ms 16c1, 16g3; other manuscripts: nhtw) is an orthographic variant, because the subject is the plural bny yhwd’ ‘sons of Judah, Judahites’, whereas in 1:10, where the subject is just yhwd’ ‘Judah’, ’zlw ‘went’ (Ms 17a3; other manuscripts: ’zl) is a real variant. In 1:26, the same form ’zlw (Ms 19c1; other manuscripts have again ’zl) is taken as orthographic, because the subject is the singular noun gbr’ ‘(the) man’. In our experiment all these variant readings are treated equally. 5 Conclusion</context>

We can test, for example, what happens if we redefine the distribution of ktb and ktbw (cf. section 4.2) and take the zero ending and the -w as allomorphs for the 3rd person masculine. In our model such a reinterpretation of the material can be registered formally by changing the relevant sections in the Word Grammar. Since the lemmatization is done automatically on the basis of the morphologically encoded text and a functional description of the morphemes, there is no need to change the lemmatization in all separate instances manually. We have done this experiment for Judges 1 in nineteen m</context>
