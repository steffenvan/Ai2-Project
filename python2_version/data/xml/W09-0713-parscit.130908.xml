<bodyText confidence="0.998710909090909">
We report on a project which we believe to
have the potential to become home to, among
others, bilingual dictionaries for African lan-
guages. Kept in a well-structured XML for-
mat with several possible degrees of confor-
mance, the dictionaries will be able to get us-
able even in their early versions, which will
be then subject to supervised improvement as
user feedback accumulates. The project is
FreeDict, part of SourceForge, a well-known
Internet repository of open source content.
We demonstrate a possible process of dic-
tionary development on the example of one
of FreeDict dictionaries, a Swahili-English
dictionary that we maintain and have been
developing through subsequent stages of in-
creasing complexity and machine-
processability. The aim of the paper is to
show that even a small bilingual lexical re-
source can be submitted to this project and
gradually developed into a machine-
processable form that can then interact with
other FreeDict resources. We also present the
immediate benefits of locating bilingual Afri-
can dictionaries in this project.
We have found FreeDict to be a very promis-
ing project with a lot of potential, and the
present paper is meant to spread the news
about it, in the hope to create an active com-
munity of linguists and lexicographers of
various backgrounds, where common re-
search subprojects can be fruitfully carried
out.

data was kept in the DICT format (Faith and
Martin, 1997).
DICT (Dictionary Server Protocol) is by now
a well-established TCP-based query/response
protocol that allows a client to access definitions
from a set of various dictionary databases. It
provides data in textual form, but it also has the
potential of providing MIME-encoded content.
The clients can be free-standing desktop applica-
tions or they can be integrated into editors or
web browsers. DICT web gateways also exist
(see e.g. http://dict.org/).
The DICT format is a plain text format with an
accompanying index file. The FreeDict-DICT
interface initially used so-called “c5 files”.1 A c5
example of an entry from version 0.0.1 of Swa-
hili-English dictionary is presented below.

Later on, the project adopted the TEI P4 standard
(Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2002) as its
primary format, and with the help of its second
administrator, Michael Bunk, created tools for
conversion from the TEI into a variety of other
dictionary platforms. A simple dictionary editor
was also created. The change of the primary
format was a very fortunate move, thanks to
which we can today recommend the project as
the possible home for free African language dic-
tionaries big and small.
We are going to base our discussion on the
Swahili-English dictionary, the first FreeDict
dictionary encoded according to the guidelines of
TEI P5 XML standard (TEI Consortium, 2007).
The dictionary in its current form is an offshoot
of a different project of ours that we decided to
make available on a free license and in version
0.4 contains over 2600 headwords. We use it to
demonstrate a possible process of dictionary de-

2 From glossaries to rich lexical data-
bases: the possible shapes of FreeDict
dictionaries
A dictionary can begin its life at FreeDict as a
simple glossary, with the simplest format possi-
ble, as shown in the made-up entry below:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.80025825">
&lt;entry&gt;
&lt;form&gt;&lt;orth&gt;alasiri&lt;/orth&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;def&gt;afternoon&lt;/def&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999690272727273">
The next example entry comes from Swahili-
English xFried Freedict Dictionary, version
0.0.2, compiled by Beata Wójtowicz. That dic-
tionary contained around 1500 entries of varied
quality. It was based on a dictionary extracted
from Morris P. Fried’s Swahili-Kiswahili to Eng-
lish Translation Program, to which selected en-
tries from the first FreeDict Swahili-English dic-
tionary (compiled by Horst Eyermann) were
added. That version also introduced information
on parts of speech.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.588359066666667">
&lt;entry&gt;
&lt;form&gt;&lt;orth&gt;alasiri&lt;/orth&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;def&gt; afternoon&lt;/def&gt;
&lt;gramGrp&gt; &lt;pos&gt;n&lt;/pos&gt; &lt;/gramGrp&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
On the way to version 0.3, the entry looked as
follows:
&lt;entry xml:id=&amp;quot;alasiri&amp;quot;&gt;
&lt;form&gt;&lt;orth&gt;alasiri&lt;/orth&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;gramGrp&gt;&lt;pos&gt;n&lt;/pos&gt;&lt;/gramGrp&gt;
&lt;sense&gt;
&lt;def&gt;afternoon (period between 3
p.m. and 5 p.m.)&lt;/def&gt;
&lt;/sense&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.993809857142857">
All the bracketed information was then turned
into separate &lt;note/&gt; elements, in order to
make the translation equivalents easily proc-
essable (see Prinsloo and de Schryver, 2002, for
remarks on processability of translation equiva-
lents). The change was performed by regex
search-and-replace, roughly from
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.947857333333333">
\((.+)\)&lt;/def&gt; into &lt;/def&gt;&lt;note
type=&amp;quot;hint&amp;quot;&gt;$1&lt;/note&gt;2, with a subsequent

done, made for the purpose of clarity. Naturally, the regexes
have to be adopted to the circumstances (regularity of mar-
kup, regularity of expressions in brackets, the number of

<bodyText confidence="0.97888315">
review of all the new &lt;note/&gt; elements ex-
tracted by an XPath query.
Depending on the regularity of expressions in
brackets, some additional words would be in-
serted into the search string, to be converted into
&lt;note/&gt; elements of the appropriate type. Ini-
tially, only @type=&amp;quot;hint&amp;quot; was used, as the
most generic. At the moment, there are several
more specialized type values, including
@type=&amp;quot;editor&amp;quot;, which contains editorial re-
marks that will not be shown to the user but will
remain in the source. @type-less &lt;note/&gt; ele-
ments are used for quick localized communica-
tion between editors and are discarded by XSLT
scripts when preparing the source version for
release (they are also clearly marked by the CSS
stylesheet that accompanies the dictionary, so
that the editors can easily spot each note when
reviewing the dictionary in a browser). FreeDict
advocates the use of some other types of notes:
recording the last editor of the entry, the date of
the latest modification, and the degree of cer-
tainty, valuable in this kind of projects (where,
e.g., some automated changes would set the cer-
tainty level to “low” and as such requiring edito-
rial approval).
In the current version, 0.4, the &lt;sense/&gt;
element looks as follows.
&lt;sense&gt;
&lt;def&gt;afternoon&lt;/def&gt;
&lt;note type=&amp;quot;def&amp;quot;&gt;period between 3
p.m. and 5 p.m.&lt;/note&gt;
&lt;/sense&gt;
This is what we decided to keep in version 0.4,
exactly for the purpose of illustrating the possi-
ble development stages of dictionaries. In the
next version, the &lt;sense/&gt; element will eventu-
ally attain the form currently (i.e., after Septem-
ber 2007) recommended by the TEI Guidelines
for translation equivalents:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.976027285714286">
&lt;sense&gt;
&lt;cit type=&amp;quot;trans&amp;quot;&gt;
&lt;quote&gt;afternoon&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;def&gt;period between 3 p.m. and
5 p.m.&lt;/def&gt;
&lt;/cit&gt;
&lt;/sense&gt;
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.993398">
The &lt;quote/&gt; element holds the translation
equivalent that can be an anchor for dictionary
such expressions per single element content, etc.). Some-
times, an XSL transformation may turn out to do a better
job, thanks to the many string-handling functions of XPath
2.0.

reversal or concatenation. The &lt;def/&gt; element
above is not abused anymore and holds a real
definition, i.e., an “explanatory equivalent”,
which may become a sense-discriminating note
in the reversed dictionary.
We stress that each of the XML structures pre-
sented above (some of them admittedly border-
ing on tag abuse) conforms to the general P5
format and can be easily processed and pub-
lished. In other words, dictionary editors are not
forced to conform to the final format in order to
see their work being used and commented on.
The next section presents another aspect of
dictionary creation, where what matters is the
ease of data manipulation and filling in the pre-
dictable information for the developer.

&lt;/sense&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
If the plural form does not exist in the dictionary,
the script creates an entry for it:
&lt;entry xml:id=&amp;quot;maadui&amp;quot;&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
&lt;orth&gt;maadui&lt;/orth&gt;

&lt;/xr&gt;
&lt;def&gt;enemy&lt;/def&gt;
&lt;def&gt;opponent &lt;note type=&amp;quot;hint&amp;quot;&gt;in
games or sports&lt;/note&gt;&lt;/def&gt;
&lt;/sense&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999828444444444">
The equivalents in this kind of automatically cre-
ated entries for plurals will remain within
&lt;def/&gt; elements even after we adopt the
cit/quote system mentioned above in the discus-
sion of alasiri. This is because &lt;def/&gt; elements
are not anchors for dictionary reversal, and plural
entries will be skipped by the reversal tools,
unless the plural/collective form has its own
unique meaning, as is the case with e.g. majani,
which is morphologically the plural form of jani
“leaf; blade of grass”, but apart from that, it
should also be glossed as “grass”, and it is the
latter form that should become a headword in the
reversed, English-Swahili dictionary.
Another area where the XML format and tools
give excellent results is text normalization. An
earlier example shows unnecessary spaces in
version 0.0.2: &lt;def&gt; afternoon&lt;/def&gt;.
Handling these required only the use of an XPath
function normalize-space(), which strips all
the unwanted whitespace characters.4
All the indexing is also done automatically.
The indexing system in this particular dictionary
is based on the shape of the headword, which it
is easy to convert into form acceptable by the
XML ID attributes (the XPath translate()
and replace() functions are handy here). All

4 That version contained more traps for machine-processing,
such as bracketed parts of words — sometimes this was
done in a nontrivial manner, as in the entry for adui:
&lt;def&gt; enemy(-ies)&lt;/def&gt;. See Prinsloo and de
Schryver (2002) for remarks on the non-friendliness of such
space-saving devices.

the entries are first reordered alphabetically, then
the script checks for homographs and assigns
them appropriate indexes (e.g. chapa-1 for the
noun meaning “brand”, chapa-2 for the verb
meaning “beat”) and appropriate attributes used
later in the creation of superscripts (suppressed
in the plain-text DICT format). Multiple senses
are also treated similarly — each receives its
own @xml:id attribute and numbering (see the
example of adui above).
We emphasize the fact that the encoding for-
mat makes it possible to reduce the developer’s
workload, with each stage of the dictionary en-
hancement being publishable. This allows one to
work on the dictionary on and off, in their spare
time.

4 Visualization of underlying structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978615571428571">
Some Swahili words are best lemmatized as
stems. Version 0.4 of our dictionary does not yet
display the differences between bound stems and
free forms, but we will transfer this functionality
(which we use in another project) to one of the
future versions. This will make it possible for us
to, e.g., add hyphens to bound forms and prepend
“-a ” to adjectives introduced by the “-a of rela-
tionship”, adding extra structure visible to the
end user, but ignored in sorting or queries.
Disjunctively written languages can be han-
dled similarly. Kiango (2000:36) lists the follow-
ing examples from Haya, discussing the prob-
lems surrounding alphabetization of nouns in
print dictionaries:
a ka yaga ‘air’
e m pambo ‘seed’
o mu twe ‘head’
The vocalic pre-prefixes should not be used for
the purpose of arranging headwords, because if
they are, all nouns end up under one of the three
letters. Instead, class prefixes (ka, m, mu) should
form the basis for alphabetization. In the
XML/TEI format adopted by FreeDict, such
problems are easily solved, either by using a
separate element to hold the pre-prefix, or by the
use of an appropriate attribute. The former solu-
tion is illustrated below.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.547760857142857">
&lt;entry&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
&lt;orth extent=&amp;quot;ppref&amp;quot;&gt;a&lt;/orth&gt;
&lt;orth&gt;ka yaga&lt;/orth&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;def&gt;air&lt;/def&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999077176470588">
The default value for the @extent attribute is
“full”, so it only needs to be mentioned where
the value is different.
An AfLaT reviewer rightly points out that in
an electronic dictionary, alphabetization is irrele-
vant. Indeed, the DICT format features separate
“dictionary” and “index” files, and searching is
done on the index file, which addresses the rele-
vant portions of the dictionary file. The issue of
alphabetization arises, however, in two cases:
when preparing a print version of the dictionary,
or when using the dictionary outside of the DICT
system (this is a “working view” for the main-
tainers that can also be used as an out-of-the-box
view for users).
In connection with the first case — preparing
print/PDF versions of dictionaries — it is worth
pointing out that conversion from TEI XML into
various publication formats is made easy thanks
to the open-source XSLT conversion suite main-
tained by Sebastian Rahtz (http://www.tei-
c.org/Tools/Stylesheets/).
As for the “out-of-the-box preview”, FreeDict
dictionaries, by virtue of being marked up in
XML, can be equipped with CSS stylesheets that
make it possible to display the XML source in
the browser, as if it were an HTML page. Here,
because the user can search the page for the
given form, alphabetization is not so relevant,
but it can be handy, if only for aesthetic reasons.
Below is a screenshot of a fragment of the CSS
view of the file swa-eng.tei from version 0.4 dis-
tribution package, opened directly in the Firefox
browser.

obviously possible as well. The figure below

Our use of colours (here: shades of grey) is also a
function of the CSS, introduced mainly with the
developer in mind, as a kind of an error-checking
device.
5 Other possible enhancements of the
microstructure
In section 3, we have illustrated a possible
method of refining dictionary structure in an
automatic fashion. Thanks to the many possible
variations of the format, other features may be
introduced stage by stage. They include, e.g.,
adding the corresponding plurals (illustrated
above) or marking forms where the plural is the
same as the singular, as done below by the use of
the @type attribute. This example also illustrates
the addition of cross-references to synonyms,
where eropleni is linked to the second, inani-
mate, sense of ndege ‘bird; airplane’.

<bodyText confidence="0.999944291666667">
Other examples of what can be gradually intro-
duced into the dictionary include addition of
subcategorization information (illustrated by
pako in Figure 2, where “pron” is the POS and
“poss” is the content of the &lt;subc/&gt; element),
addition of explicit noun-class- and agreement-
marking, introduction of irregularly inflected
forms, tables with inflection (linked to the ap-
propriate stems), nested entries, and, obviously,
the continuous improvement of lexicographic
information (the arrangement and selection of
senses, selection of headwords, an appropriate
POS system).
Crucially, this system allows a developer to
“publish early, publish often”, and few of the
enhancements mentioned here depend on others
— developers are free to choose and to extend
the dictionary at their own pace.
In our case, this is a gradual move towards
structures of finer granularity, suitable for rever-
sal (into English-Swahili) and concatenation with
other dictionaries (we are going to use English as
the bridge language for pairing the Swahili-
English dictionary with English-* dictionaries).

FreeDict is the nexus for the following:

• XML, with its potential for creating
well-structured documents,
• TEI P5, a de-facto standard taking ad-
vantage of this potential,
• the SourceForge repository as well as
distribution and content-management net-
work,
• the DICT distribution network: apart
from being able to query DICT servers

can also take advantage of an add-on cli-

DICT format (usable directly from DICT
servers and by other dictionary-providing
projects, e.g., StarDict or Open Dict).6
Additionally, lexical resources submitted to
FreeDict may undergo further transformations:
reversal or concatenation, which means that
work put into developing a single resource may
well be re-used in developing others. Consider-
ing the possible re-use of lexical resources, they
are expected to be prepared with a view towards
clean exposure of translation equivalents (in the
cit/quote system or at least by judicious use of
separators and brackets).

7 The costs of developing for FreeDict
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99793075">
An AfLaT reviewer suggested that we provide a
measure of the effort required to develop a re-
source for FreeDict. We hope to show here that
this is very much dependent on the quality and
form of the resource and on how much time the
dictionary creator is willing to invest into it. Cru-
cially, given the open-source nature of the pro-
ject, even a simple, small list of near-binary pair-
ings of equivalents can be a) quickly made useful
to e.g. the readers of web pages written in the
given language, and b) extended by others into a
more satisfying resource.
It may be that the effort needed to create lan-
guage resources in e.g. Lexique Pro, an excellent
free tool by SIL International
(http://www.lexiquepro.com/) is smaller, but
there are differences in that Lexique Pro is a
Windows-only closed-source program whose
native MDF (Multi-Dictionary-Formatter) format
is not as flexible as XML and therefore cannot be
processed by the many tools that handle XML
and TEI in particular. Consequently, the perspec-
tives for re-use of Lexique Pro dictionaries in
computational linguistic applications are much
smaller. To our knowledge, Lexique Pro does not
make it possible for users to query words straight
off web pages, which can be done thanks to dict,
a Firefox add-on (http://dict.mozdev.org/). It ad-
mittedly has other advantages that make it a seri-
ous alternative.7
The ideal solution would be to have an editing
front-end such as Lexique Pro coupled with the
openness and modifiability of the data offered by
FreeDict. Indeed, there are plans for creating a
converter from the new LIFT interchange stan-
dard (http://code.google.com/p/lift-standard/)
that the beta versions of Lexique Pro can read
7 We do not discuss professional commercial dictionary
writing systems such as TshwaneLex
(http://tshwanedje.com/tshwanelex/) because, despite the
academic discounts, they may be out of range for the aver-
age developer. It is worth mentioning that the discounted
versions of TshwaneLex come with the understandable “no-
commercial-use” restriction, which is in conflict with either
the GNU Public License or the nearly equivalent Creative
Commons BY-SA license that all SourceForge resources
must be under (cf. http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-
faq.html).

and write, to the version of the TEI format used
by FreeDict. That would undoubtedly enhance
the attractiveness of the project.
To sum up, developing for FreeDict minimally
requires some basic knowledge of XML. Free
XML editors exist (e.g. XML Copy Editor,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xml-copy-editor/)
that can make editing easier by autocompleting
the elements (inserting closing tags, suggesting
elements and attributes that are allowed at the
given place in the structure) and signalling en-
coding mistakes.

8 African Languages and FreeDict
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992859333333333">
A reviewer remarked that the link to African lan-
guage technology in this paper appears only to be
present in the examples. Indeed, FreeDict is not a
project that focuses on African-languages — it is
a project where African language resources can
be hosted and quickly become useful to users.
Given an opportunity, we will encourage re-
searches dealing with other languages to join the
project — which will hopefully result in the crea-
tion of more cross-language resources, especially
given that the encoding format is not tied to any
particular language and is able to easily accom-
modate features characteristic of practically any
language.
During the session on “African Languages in
Advance” at the 2008 Poznań Linguistic Meet-
ing, where we presented our Swahili-Polish pro-
ject and also mentioned FreeDict as the place
where we wanted to donate parts of our test
Swahili-English dictionary that would otherwise
remain on our disks, we talked to an organizer of
that session, Karien Brits, about the advantages
that this project can have for some of her col-
leagues working on South-African languages.
This is what encouraged us to move on with the
FreeDict Swahili-English dictionary and we hope
that others will also find this project, and the
possibilities that it offers, attractive.
The FreeDict project has recently awoken af-
ter a period of lower activity, and at the moment,
every week brings something new. Currently, as
far as African languages are concerned, apart
from SwahiliHEnglish dictionaries, the project
hosts very basic AfrikaansHEnglish dictionaries,
and an Afrikaans-German dictionary (all of them
in need of a maintainer).8 We hope that FreeDict

link on the project page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/

by setting the appropriate language pair in the database.
will become home to many African language
resources, and, thanks to the possibility of dic-
tionary concatenation, facilitate also the creation
of many AfricanHEuropean dictionary pairs as
well as all-African bilingual dictionaries.

<abstract confidence="0.9964455">We report on a project which we believe to have the potential to become home to, among others, bilingual dictionaries for African languages. Kept in a well-structured XML format with several possible degrees of conformance, the dictionaries will be able to get usable even in their early versions, which will be then subject to supervised improvement as user feedback accumulates. The project is FreeDict, part of SourceForge, a well-known Internet repository of open source content. We demonstrate a possible process of dictionary development on the example of one of FreeDict dictionaries, a Swahili-English dictionary that we maintain and have been through subsequent stages of incomplexity and processability. The aim of the paper is to show that even a small bilingual lexical resource can be submitted to this project and gradually developed into a machineprocessable form that can then interact with other FreeDict resources. We also present the immediate benefits of locating bilingual African dictionaries in this project. We have found FreeDict to be a very promising project with a lot of potential, and the present paper is meant to spread the news about it, in the hope to create an active community of linguists and lexicographers of various backgrounds, where common research subprojects can be fruitfully carried out.</abstract>

At first, the Beata Wójtowicz Institute of Oriental Studies University of Warsaw Warsaw, Poland b.wojtowicz@uw.edu.pl data was kept in the DICT format (Faith and Martin, 1997). DICT (Dictionary Server Protocol) is by now a well-established TCP-based query/response protocol that allows a client to access definitions from a set of various dictionary databases. It provides data in textual form, but it also has the potential of providing MIME-encoded content. The clients can be free-standing desktop applications or they can be integrated into editors or web browsers. DICT web gateways also exist (see e.g. http://dict.org/). The DICT format is a plain text format with an accompanying index file. The FreeDict-DICT interface initially used so-called “c5 files”.1 A c5 exam</context>

Version 0.4 of our dictionary does not yet display the differences between bound stems and free forms, but we will transfer this functionality (which we use in another project) to one of the future versions. This will make it possible for us to, e.g., add hyphens to bound forms and prepend “-a ” to adjectives introduced by the “-a of relationship”, adding extra structure visible to the end user, but ignored in sorting or queries. Disjunctively written languages can be handled similarly. Kiango (2000:36) lists the following examples from Haya, discussing the problems surrounding alphabetization of nouns in print dictionaries: a ka yaga ‘air’ e m pambo ‘seed’ o mu twe ‘head’ The vocalic pre-prefixes should not be used for the purpose of arranging headwords, because if they are, all nouns end up under one of the three letters. Instead, class prefixes (ka, m, mu) should form the basis for alphabetization. In the XML/TEI format adopted by FreeDict, such problems are easily solved, either by using a separate element to hold the pre-prefix, or by the use of an appropriate attribute. The former </context>
