<bodyText confidence="0.999444416666667">
This paper describes the design
criteria and annotation guidelines of
Sinica Treebank. The three design
criteria are: Maximal Resource Sharing,
Minimal Structural Complexity, and
Optimal Semantic Information. One of
the important design decisions
following these criteria is the encoding
of thematic role information. An on-line
interface facilitating empirical studies of
Chinese phrase structure is also
described.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999548655172414">
The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.
1993) initiated a new paradigm in
corpus-based research. The English
Penn Treebank has enabled and
motivated corpus and computational
linguistic research based on information
extractable from structurally annotated
corpora. Recently, the research has
focused on the following two issues:
first, when and how can a structurally
annotated corpus of language X be
built?
Second, what information should or
can be annotated? A good sample of
issues in these two directions can be
found in the papers collected in Abeille
(1999).
The construction of the Sinica
Treebank deals with both issues. First, it
is one of the first structurally annotated
corpora in Mandarin Chinese. Second,
as a design feature, the Sinica Treebank
annotation includes thematic role
information in addition to syntactic
categories. In this paper, we will discuss
the design criteria and annotation
guidelines of the Sinica Treebank. We
will also give a preliminary research
result based on the Sinica Treebank.

2. Design Criteria
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996395">
There are three important design
criteria for the Sinica Treebank:
maximal resource sharing, minimal
structural complexity, and optimal
semantic information.
First, to achieve maximal resource
sharing, the construction of the Sinica
Treebank is bootstrapped from existing

Chinese computational linguistic
resources. The textual material is
extracted from the tagged Sinica Corpus
(http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms.bin-
kiwi.sh, Chen et al. 1996). In other

words, the tasks and issues involving
tokenization / word segmentation and
category assignment are previously
resolved. It is worth noting that the
segmentation and tagging of Sinica
Corpus have undergone vigorous
post-editing. Hence the precision of
category-assignment is much higher
than with an automatically tagged
corpora. In addition, since the same
research team carried out the tagging of
Sinica Corpus and annotation of Sinica
Treebank, consistency of the
interpretation of texts and tags are
ensured. For structure-assignment, an
automatic parser (Chen 1996) is applied
before human post-editing.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.978795407407407">
Second, the criterion of minimal
structural complexity is motivated to
ensure that the assigned structural
information can be shared regardless of
users&apos; theoretical presupposition. It is
observed that theory-internal
motivations often require abstract
intermediate phrasal levels (such as in
various versions of the X-bar theory).
Other theories may also call for an
abstract covert phrasal category (such as
INFL in the GB theory for Chinese). In
either case, although the phrasal
categories are well-motivated within the
theory, their significance cannot be
maintained in the context of other
theoretical frameworks. Since a primary
goal of annotated corpora is to serve as
the empirical base of linguistic
investigations, it is desirable to annotate
structure divisions that are the most
commonly shared among theories. We
came to the conclusion that the minimal
basic level structures are the ones that
are shared by all theories. Thus our
annotation is designed to achieve
minimal structural complexity. All
abstract phrasal levels are eliminated
and only canonical phrasal categories
are marked.
Third, a critical issue involving
Treebank construction as well as
theories of NLP is how much semantic
information, if any, should be
incorporated. The original Penn
Treebank took a fairly straightforward
syntactic approach. A purely semantic
approach, though tempting in terms of
theoretical and practical considerations,
has never been attempted yet. A third
approach is to annotate partial semantic
information, especially those pertaining
to argument-relations. This is an
approach shared by us and the Prague
Dependency Treebank (e.g. Bohmova
and Hajikova 1999). In this approach,
the thematic relation between a predicate
and an argument is marked in addition to
grammatical category. Note that the
predicate-argument relation is usually
grammatically instantiated and generally
considered to be the semantic relation
that interacts most closely with syntactic
behavior. This allows optimal semantic

information to be encoded without going
too beyond the partially automatic
process of argument identification.

3. Annotation Guidelines I:
Category and Hierarchy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999205391304348">
The basic structure of a tree in a
treebank is a hierarchy of nodes with
categorical denotation. As in any
standard phrase structure grammar, the
lexical (i.e. terminal) symbols are
defined by the lexicon (CKIP 1992).
And following the recent lexicon-driven
and information-based trends in
linguistic theory, linguistic information
will be projected from encoded lexical
information. Please refer to CK1P (1993)
for the definition of lexical categories
that we followed. We will give below
the inventory of the restricted set of
phrasal categories used and their
interpretation. This set defines the
domain of expressed syntactic
information (instead of projected or
inherited information). Readers can also
consult Chen et al.&apos;s (2000) general
description of how the Sinica Treebank
is constructed for a more complete list of
tags as well as explanation in Chinese.

3.1. Defining Phrasal Categories
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998644666666667">
There are only 6 non-terminal
phrasal categories annotated in the
Sinica Treebank.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96628475">
(1) Phrasal Categories
1. S: An S is a complete tree headed by a
predicate (i.e. S is the start symbol).
2.VP: A VP is a phrase headed by a
predicate. However, it lacks a
subject and cannot function alone.
3. NP: An NP is headed by an N.
4.GP: A GP is a phrase headed by
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.646911125">
locational noun or locational adjunct.
Since the thematic role is often
determined by the governing
predicate and not encoded locally;
nominal phrases are given a tentative
role of DUMMY so that it can
inherit the correct role from the main
predicate.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9982895">
5. PP: A PP is headed by a preposition.
The thematic role of its argument is
inherited from the mother, hence its
argument is marked with a
DUMMY.
6. XP: A XP is a conjunctive phrase that
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996599">
is headed by a conjunction. Its
syntactic head is the conjunction.
However, since the actual category
depends on the interactive
inheritance from possibly
non-identical conjoined elements, X
in XP stands for an under-specified
category.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991018">
3.2. Defining Inheritance Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9941091">
Following unification-based
grammatical theories, categorical
assignments in Sinica Treebank are both
lexicon-driven and head-driven. In
principle, all grammatical information is
lexically encoded. Structurally heads
indicate the direction of information
inheritance and defme possible
predicate-argument relations. However,
since the notion &apos;head&apos; can have several
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999229">
31
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.7717606">
different linguistic definitions, we
attempt to allow at least the discrepancy
between syntactic and semantic heads.
In Sinica, Treebank, three different kinds
of grammatical heads are annotated.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.811142">
(2) Heads
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.958557947368421">
1.Head: indicates a grammatical head in
an endocentric phrasal category.
Unless a different semantic head is
explicitly marked, a Head marks a
category that serves simultaneously as
the syntactic and semantic heads of the
construction.
2.head: indicates a semantic head which
does not simultaneously function as a
syntactic head. For instance in
constructions involving
graxrunaticalized &apos;particles,&apos; such as in
the &apos;VP-.de&apos; construction, the
grammatical head (&apos;de&apos; in this case)
does not carry any semantic
information. In these cases, the head
marks the semantic head (`VP&apos; in this
case) to indicate the flow of content
information.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.661600333333333">
3. DUMMY: indicates the semantic
head(s) whose categorical or thematic
identity cannot be locally determined.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999458928571428">
The two most likely scenarios
involving DUMMY are (a) in a
coordination construction, where the
head category depends on the sum of
all conjuncts. And (b) in a non-NP
argument phrase, such as PP, where
the semantic head carries a thematic
role assigned not by the immediate
governing syntactic head (&amp;quot;P&amp;quot; in this
case), but by a higher predicate. In
these cases, DUMMY allows a parser
to determine the correct categorical /
thematic relation later, while
maintaining identical local structures.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992694">
3.3. Beyond Simple Inheritance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884">
When simple inheritance fails, the
following principles derived from our
design criteria serve to predict the
structural assignments of a phrasal
category: default inheritance, sisters only,
and left most.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.446664">
3.3.1. Default Inheritance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999752043478261">
This principle deals primarily and
most effectively with coordinations and
conjunctions. The theoretical motivation
of this account follows Sag et al.&apos;s (1985)
proposal. In essence, the category of a
conjunctive construction must be
inherited from its semantic heads.
However, since conjunctions are not
restricted to same categories, languages
must have principled ways to determine
the categorical identity when different
semantic heads carry different
information.
First, in the trivial case when all
head daughters are of the same category,
the mother will inherit that category.
Second, when the different head
daughters are an elaboration of the same
basic category (e.g. both Nd and Ne are
elaboration of N), then the basic
category is the default inheritance
category for the mother. This can be
illustrated by (3).

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.997243333333333">
when other inheritance
mechanisms fail to provide a clear
categorical choice, the default
inheritance is activated. There are two
default hierarchies. The first one deals
with when the head daughters are all
lexical categories (4a), and the second
one deals with when they are all phrasal
categories (4b). If there is a disparity
between lexical and phrasal categories,
then a lexical category will be expanded
to a phrasal category first.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9979874">
(4) Default Inheritance Hierarchy for
Categories

b) Phrasal Categories: S&gt; VP&gt; NP&gt;
PP&gt; GP
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9085175">
When phrasal conjuncts are involved, S
is the privileged category since it is the
start symbol of the grammar. VP comes
next since its structural composition is
identical to that of S. If the structure
involved is not a predicate (i.e. head of a
sentence), then it must be a role. For
argument roles, NP&apos;s are more
privileged than PP&apos;s, and PP&apos;s are more
privileged than GP&apos;s. (5) is an instance
of the application of this default
hierarchy.

&apos;bountiful and of big quantity&apos;
When lexical conjuncts are involved, the
same principle is used. The priority is
given to the predicate head of the
sentence. Among possible argument
roles, the nominal category is the default.
An illustrative example can be found in
(6).

3.3.2 Sisters Only
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963090909091">
Following most current linguistic
theory, argument roles and adjunct
complements must be sisters of a lexical
head. However, driven by our design
criteria of minimal structural complexity,
no same level iteration is allowed. Thus
these arguments and adjuncts can be
located by the straightforward definition
of sisterhood: that they share the same
mother-daughter relation with the head.
The result is a flat structure.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.599545">
3.3.3 Left First
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999368375">
This principle is designed to
account for possible internal structure
when there are more than two sisters
without having to add on hierarchical
complexity. Hence, the default
interpretation of internal structure of
multiple sisters is that the internal
association starts from left to right.

</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.848058">
Structural Annotation of
Thematic Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.721182088888889">
A thematic relation contains a
compact bundle of syntactic and
semantic information. Although
thematic relations are lexically encoded
on a predicate, they can only be
instantiated when that information is
projected to phrasal arguments. In other
words, the only empirical evidence for
the existence of a thematic relation is a
realized argument. However, a realized
argument cannot by itself determine the
thematic relation. The exact nature of
the relation must be determined based
on the lexical information from the
predicate as well as checking of the
compatibility of that realized argument.
Since structural information alone
cannot determine thematic relations,
prototypical structural annotation, such
as in the original Penn Treebank, does
not include thematic roles since they
contain non-structural information.
On the other hand, in theories
where lexical heads drive the structural
derivation / construction (e.g. ICG and
HPSG and LFG), thematic relations are
critical. Hence, we decided to encode
realized thematic relations on each
phrasal argument. The list of thematic
relations encoded on the head predicate
is consulted whenever a phrasal
argument is constructed, and a
contextually appropriate relation
sanctioned by the lexical information is
encoded. It is worth noting that in our
account, we not only mark the thematic
relations of a verbal predicate, but we
also mark the thematic relations
governed by a deverbal noun, among
others. Also note that an argument of a
preposition is marked as a placeholder
DUMMY. This is because a preposition
only governs an argument syntactically,
while its thematic relation is determined
by a higher verb.

5. Current Status of the Sinica
Treebank and On-line
Interface
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997454565217391">
Following the above criteria and
principles, we have already finished
Sinica Treebank 1.0. It contains
annotations of 38,725 Chinese structural
trees containing 239,532 words. It
covers subject areas that include politics,
traveling, sports, finance, society, etc.
This version of the Sinica Treebank will
be released in the near future as soon as
the licensing documents are cleared by
the legal department of Academia Sinica.
A small subset of it (1,000 sentences) is
already available for researchers to
download from the website
http://godel.iis.sinica.edu.tw/CKIP/
trees1000.htm. A searchable interface is
also being developed and tested for
researchers so that they can directly
access the complete treebank
information.
As an annotated corpus, one of the
most important roles that a treebank can
play is that it can serve as a shared
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998301">

<bodyText confidence="0.995079878048781">
source of data for linguistic, especially
syntactic studies. Following the example
of the successful Sinica Corpus, we have
developed an on-line interface for
extraction of grammatical information
from the Sinica Treebank. Although the
users that we have in mind are
theoretical linguists who do not
necessarily have computational
background; we hope that non-linguists
can also benefit from the ready
availability of such grammatical
information. And of course,
computational linguists should be able
to use this interface for quick references
before going into a more in-depth study
of the annotated corpus.
Currently, the beta site allows users
specify a variety of conditions to search
for structurally annotated sentences.
Conditions can be specified in terms of
keywords, grammatical tags (lexical or
phrasal), thematic relations, or any
boolean combination of the above
elements. The search result can be
presented as either annotated structure or
simply the example sentences. Simply
statistics, based on either straightforward
frequency count or mutual information,
are also available. For linguistically
interesting information, such as the
heads of various phrasal constructions, a
user can simply look up the explicitly
syntactic Head or semantic head; as
well as DUMMY when it serves as a
head placeholder. The website of this
interface, as well as the general release
of the Sinica Treebank 1.0, is scheduled
to be announced at the second ACL
workshop on Chinese Language
Processing in October 2000.

Defining Inheritance Relations Following unification-based grammatical theories, categorical assignments in Sinica Treebank are both lexicon-driven and head-driven. In principle, all grammatical information is lexically encoded. Structurally heads indicate the direction of information inheritance and defme possible predicate-argument relations. However, since the notion &apos;head&apos; can have several 31 different linguistic definitions, we attempt to allow at least the discrepancy between syntactic and semantic heads. In Sinica, Treebank, three different kinds of grammatical heads are annotated. (2) Heads 1.Head: indicates a grammatical head in an endocentric phrasal category. Unless a different semantic head is explicitly marked, a Head marks a category that serves simultaneously as the syntactic and semantic heads of the construction. 2.head: indicates a semantic head which does not simultaneously function as a syntactic head. For instance in constructions involving graxrunaticalized &apos;particles,&apos; such as in the &apos;VP-.de&apos; construction, the grammatical head (&apos;de&apos; in this case) does not carry any semantic information. In these cases, the head marks the semantic head (`VP&apos; in this case) to </context>
