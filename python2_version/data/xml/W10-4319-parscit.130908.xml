The present study uses the dialogue paradigm
to explore route communication. It revolves
around the analysis of a corpus of route in-
structions produced in real-time interaction
with the follower. It explores the variation in
forming route instructions and the factors that
contribute in it. The results show that visual
co-presence influences the performance, con-
versation patterns and configuration of instruc-
tions. Most importantly, the results suggest an
analogy between the choices of instruction-
givers and the communicative actions of their
partners.

The main question this paper attempts to ad-

dialogue. The current zeitgeist in language re-
search and dialogue system development seems
to be the unified investigation of spatial language
and dialogue (Coventry et al., 2009). Indicative
of the growing prioritisation of dialogue in the
study of spatial language are the on-going re-

<bodyText confidence="0.99966325">
The study uses CORK (Communication of Route
Knowledge, (Allen 2000)), a framework which
provides a component-based analysis of route
instructions. The CORK taxonomy differentiates
between instructions that are directives (action
statements with verbs of movement) and descrip-
tive statements (with state-of-being verbs, like
&amp;quot;be&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;). Descriptives present a static pic-

ture of spatial relations and provide the follower
the opportunity to verify his position or reorient
himself. The taxonomy also considers elements
that provide specificity and distinguishing infor-
mation about environmental features, called de-
limiters. Within this framework, Allen (2000)
describes a set of principles pertaining to the
configuration of route descriptions. Namely,
people concentrate descriptives and delimiters on
points along the route that offer for uncertainty
(like crossroads). Moreover, the selection and
placement of these components depends on the
characteristics of the environment and the per-
ceived needs of the follower. Evidence from em-
pirical work supports the framework, reporting
that errors in navigation increased when the route
directions violated these principles. Nevertheless,
the applicability of the suggested principles has
only been tested in scenarios in which the direc-
tions were produced beforehand by either the
experimenters or a separate group of subjects.

1.3 The effect of visual information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999766923076923">
Studies exploring the effect of visual information
on task-oriented interaction converge on that vis-
ual feedback leads to more efficient interactions
and influences the conversational patterns be-
tween participants (Clark and Krych, 2004; Ger-
gle et al., 2004; Koulouri and Lauria, 2009).
These phenomena are generally attributed to the
ease of establishing &amp;quot;common ground&amp;quot; when
visual feedback is available. However, to the au-
thors&apos; knowledge, most related studies have fo-
cused on high-level analysis of dialogue acts and
many aspects of how interlocutors adapt their
linguistic choices remain undefined.

A study was designed to elicit natural route in-
structions in a restricted context. Pairs of partici-
pants collaborated in a navigation task, in a &amp;quot;Wi-
zard-of-Oz&amp;quot; set-up. The instructors provided in-
structions to navigate their partners to designated
locations in a simulated town, being under the
impression that they were interacting with a
software agent (robot). The study manipulated
two factors; i) availability of visual information
on follower&apos;s actions and ii), follower&apos;s interac-
tive capacity. With regard to the first factor, there
were two conditions in which the ability to moni-
tor the actions of the &amp;quot;robot&amp;quot; was either removed
or provided. The second factor also involved two
conditions. In the first condition, the followers
could interact using unconstrained language
(henceforth, &amp;quot;Free&amp;quot; condition). In the second
condition (henceforth, &amp;quot;Constrained&amp;quot; condition),
a set of predetermined responses available to the
followers aimed to coerce them towards more
&amp;quot;automated&amp;quot; contributions; for instance, &amp;quot;open-
ended&amp;quot; repairs such as &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;, which provide
no specific information on the source of the
problem. However, the followers were still able
to be interactive if they wished so, by clicking
the relevant buttons to request clarification or
provide location information.
The study followed a between-subjects fac-
torial design. A total of 56 students were allo-
cated in the four conditions: Monitor-Free,
Monitor-Constrained, No Monitor-Free, No
Monitor-Constrained. The experimental proce-
dure is described in detail in (Koulouri and
Lauria, 2009).

<bodyText confidence="0.9997012">
The experiment relied on a custom-built sys-
tem which supported the interactive simulation
and enabled real-time direct text communication
between the pairs. The interfaces consisted of a
graphical display and a dialogue box.
The interface of the instructor displayed the
full map of the simulated town (Figure /). On the
upper right corner of the interface, there could be
a small &amp;quot;monitor&amp;quot;, in which the robot&apos;s imme-
diate locality was displayed, but not the robot
itself. The presence of the monitor feature de-
pended on the experimental condition.
The followers&apos; interface displayed a fraction
of the map, the surroundings of the robot&apos;s cur-
rent position. The robot was operated by the fol-
lower using the arrow keys on the keyboard. In
the &amp;quot;Free&amp;quot; conditions followers could freely type
messages. In the &amp;quot;Constrained&amp;quot; conditions, the
followers needed to use the buttons on the inter-
face (Figure 2).

The analysis of the corpus of route instructions
followed the CORK framework (Allen, 2000).
Communicative statements were classified as
Directives or Descriptives. These communica-

features considered were: Locations (e.g., build-
ings or bridges), Pathways (e.g., streets), Choice
Points (e.g., junctions) and Destination. Last,
instructions can be composed of delimiters,
which fall into four categories:

The experiment yielded a large corpus of /60
dialogues, composed of 3,386 turns. /,485 in-
structions were collected. First, the analysis con-
siders some common measures of efficiency.
Next, the results of the component analysis of
instructions are presented.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999738">
3.1 Efficiency of interaction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911615384615">
The number and length of turns and instructions
and time needed to complete each task are typi-
cally used as measures of the efficiency of inter-
action. Additionally, fewer execution and under-
standing failures are taken as indicators of supe-
rior performance.
Time, number of turns, words and instruc-
tions: The ANOVA performed on time per task
showed no reliable significant differences among
groups. On the other hand, significant effects
were observed with regard to all other dependent
variables. An interaction effect was revealed af-
ter analysis on numbers of turns (F(/, 24) =
3.993, p = .05). Pairs in the Monitor-Free condi-
tion required less turns to complete the task
compared to the other groups (column / of Table
/). It seems however that instructors in both
Monitor conditions were dominating the conver-
sational floor, having produced about 58% of the
turns, compared to instructors in the No Monitor
conditions (F(/, 24) = 5.303, p = .03). Neverthe-
less, it was not the case that instructors in Moni-
tor conditions were &amp;quot;wordier&amp;quot;. The number of
words was similar among all instructor groups.
The results indicated that the total number of
words required to complete a task was much
lower in Monitor conditions (F(/, 24) = = 5.2/5,
p = 0.03) (see column 3 in Table /). Next, in-
structors in Monitor conditions gave more in-
structions to guide the followers to the destina-
tion (F(/, 24) = 3.494, p = .07). However, these
instructions were considerably shorter compared
to the instructions provided by No Monitor in-
structors (F(/, 24) = 4.268, p = .05). All differ-
ences are amplified in the Monitor-Constrained
group, in which more turns and instructions were
needed but with fewer words and the &amp;quot;turn pos-
session&amp;quot; of the instructor was the highest among
the groups.

Frequency of miscommunication: Miscom-

measures: the number of execution errors and of
follower turns that were tagged as expressing
non-understanding. The ANOVA revealed an
interaction effect (F (/, 24) = 4.0/2, p = .05).
Striking differences were observed between the

3.2 Component analysis of instructions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998234921052632">
This section presents the results of the analysis
on inclusion of landmark references, types of
delimiters and communicative statements.
Landmark references: Instructors in both No
Monitor conditions preferred to produce instruc-
tions that were anchored on landmarks, especial-
ly on 3D locations such as buildings (28% of
instructions contained locations vs /4% in the
Monitor conditions, (F (/, 24) = /2.034, p =
.002)). On the other hand, Monitor instructors
opted for simple action prescriptions. Particular-
ly, 75% of the instructions in the Monitor-
Constrained condition omitted any kind of refer-
ence (compared to an average of 42% in the oth-
er conditions).
Delimiters: Category 2 delimiters that pro-
vided simple direction information were preva-
lent in Monitor conditions (F (/, 24) = //.407, p
= .002). Further, an interaction effect was found
(F (/, 24) = 3.802, p = .0/); the number of cate-
gory 2 delimiters almost doubles in the Monitor-
Constrained condition. On the contrary, the use
of category / delimiters, which provide informa-
tion on the boundary of the route is very limited
in the Monitor-Constrained condition (F (/, 24) =
5.350, p = .03). The third category of delimiters
includes terms that specify the relation between
traveller and an environmental feature (&amp;quot;on your
left&amp;quot;) or between environmental features. Again,
the difference arises in the Monitor-Constrained
condition, which included the lowest number of
category 3 delimiters (marginal effect, F (/, 24)
= 3.392, p = .07). Finally, the analysis performed
on the frequency of category 4 delimiters did not
yield any significant effect.

statements: An interaction effect was revealed

condition produced less descriptives, which give
information about relations among features in the
environment and tap perceptual experience (&amp;quot;you
will see a bridge&amp;quot;). In particular, in the Monitor-
Constrained condition, 4.7% of instructions were
descriptives, whereas the proportion of descrip-
tives averaged /0% in all other conditions.

The results resonate with previous research. The
actions of the followers served as an immediate,
accurate and effortless indicator of their current
state of understanding, making verbal feedback
redundant. Monitor instructors could readily con-
firm their assumptions about the information re-
quirements of followers and used linguistics
shortcuts and simpler instructions exactly at the
moment needed. On the other hand, in the No
Monitor condition, uncertainty about the position
and movement of the robot created the need for
elaborate and explicit instructions. The contribu-
tion of the present study lies on that it grounds
these observations on quantitative analysis, using
measures like words, turns and the relative fre-
quencies of certain types of instruction compo-
nents that vary in information value. Most impor-
tantly, it describes the specific ways in which
instructors configure their directions in the pres-
ence/absence of visual information.
The CORK framework predicts that route pro-
tocols which are rich in descriptives and rela-
tional terms are associated with more successful
navigation, compared to simple directional ones.
Our results partially meet this expectation, since
large numbers of execution errors and non-
understandings were only observed in the Moni-
tor-Constrained condition, whereas miscommu-
nication rates were similar across the other
groups. Indeed, this condition was found to gen-
erally differ from the rest. In particular, In the
Monitor-Constrained condition, the dialogues
were the shortest in terms of words. Instructors
produced many but short instructions. The com-
ponent-based analysis revealed that they em-
ployed overwhelmingly more action-based in-
structions without landmark references and de-
scriptives. Boundary information on the route,
frame of reference and spatial relations between
environmental features were typically omitted. In
both Constrained conditions, followers were ex-
pected to resort to a &amp;quot;mechanical&amp;quot; interaction, as
coerced by the presence of the predefined re-
sponses. Inspection of the dialogues revealed that
followers in the Monitor-Constrained condition
did so, given the precedence of visual feedback.
This was not the case with No Monitor-
Constrained followers who needed to verbally
ground information. Dialogue examples are pro-
vided in Table 2 below.

Thus, we propose that the linguistic choices of
the followers &amp;quot;prime&amp;quot; the instructor&apos;s own strat-
egies. In the Monitor-Constrained Condition,
followers were less interactive, and gave fewer
responses with lower information value. In har-
mony, their partners provided less elaborate in-
structions, which also lacked important informa-
tion and specificity.
In conclusion, the findings confirm our initial
hypotheses. Instructions are sensitive to condi-
tions of (visual) co-presence. Moreover, a direct
link was identified between the way in which
instructions and follower&apos;s contributions are
formulated. Following this lead, we are now fo-
cusing on a fine-grained analysis of the utter-
ances of the follower.

In the Free conditions, there were no buttons and followers could freely type any message. 2.2 Data analysis The analysis of the corpus of route instructions followed the CORK framework (Allen, 2000). Communicative statements were classified as These communicative statements could contain references to environmental features. The types of environmental considered were: buildor bridges), streets), junctions) and Last, instructions can be composed of delimiters, which fall into four categories: designations: see a car park&amp;quot;. Direction designations: &amp;quot;go Relational terms: your left&amp;quot;&apos; Modifiers: red &amp;quot;take 96 3 Results The experiment yielded a large corpus of /60 dialogues, composed of 3,386 turns. /,485 instructions were collected. First, the analysis considers some common measures of efficiency. Next, the results of the component analysis of instructions are presented. 3.1 Efficiency of interaction The number and length of turns and instructions and time needed to complete each task are typically used as measures of the efficiency of interaction. Additionally, fewer execution and understanding failures are taken as indicators of superior performance. Time, number of turns, words and instruc- ANOVA performed on time per task showed no reliable significant differences among groups. On the other hand, significant effects were observed with regard to all other dependent variables. An interaction effect was revealed after analysis on numbers of turns (F(/, 24) = 3.993, p = .05). Pairs in the Monitor-Free condition required less turns to complete the task compared to the other groups (column / of Table /). It seems however that instructors in both Monitor conditions were dominating the conversational floor, having produced about 58% of the turns, compared to instructors in the No Monitor conditions (F(/, 24) = 5.303, p = .03). Nevertheless, it was not the case that instructors in Monitor conditions were &amp;quot;wordier&amp;quot;. The number of words was similar among all instructor groups. The results indicated that the total number of words required to complete a task was much lower in Monitor conditions (F(/, 24) = = 5.2/5, p = 0.03) (see column 3 in Table /). Next, instructors in Monitor conditions gave more instructions to guide the followers to the destination (F(/, 24) = 3.494, p = .07). However, these instructions were considerably shorter compared to the instructions provided by No Monitor instructors (F(/, 24) = 4.268, p = .05). All differences are amplified in the Monitor-Constrained group, in which more turns and instructions were needed but with fewer words and the &amp;quot;turn possession&amp;quot; of the instructor was the highest among the groups.

Summary of Results (mean values). of miscommunication: Miscommunication was calculated by considering two measures: the number of execution errors and of follower turns that were tagged as expressing non-understanding. The ANOVA revealed an interaction effect (F (/, 24) = 4.0/2, p = .05). Striking differences were observed between the Monitor-Constrained group and the rest; in particular, followers in this condition were twice or three times more likely to fail to understand and execute instructions (see last column in Table /). 3.2 Component analysis of instructions This section presents the results of the analysis on inclusion of landmark references, types of delimiters and communicative statements. references: in both No Monitor conditions preferred to produce instructions that were anchored on landmarks, especially on 3D locations such as buildings (28% of instructions contained locations vs /4% in the Monitor conditions, (F (/, 24) = /2.034, p = .002)). On the other hand, Monitor instructors opted for simple action prescriptions. Particularly, 75% of the instructions in the Monitor- Constrained condition omitted any kind of reference (compared to an average of 42% in the other conditions). 2 delimiters that provided simple direction information were prevalent in Monitor conditions (F (/, 24) = //.407, p = .002). Further, an interaction effect was found (F (/, 24) = 3.802, p = .0/); the number of category 2 delimiters almost doubles in the Monitor- Constrained condition. On the contrary, the use of category / delimiters, which provide information on the boundary of the route is very limited in the Monitor-Constrained condition (F (/, 24) = 5.350, p = .03). The third category of delimiters includes terms that specify the relation between traveller and an environmental feature (&amp;quot;on your left&amp;quot;) or between environmental features. Again, the difference arises in the Monitor-Constrained condition, which included the lowest number of category 3 delimiters (marginal effect, F (/, 24) = 3.392, p = .07). Finally, the analysis performed on the frequency of category 4 delimiters did not yield any significant effect. Directive and descriptive communicative interaction effect was revealed with regard to the proportion of directives and 52.28% 105.38 5.29 8.58 1.20 50.62% 100.35 5.07 7.68 0.69 97 descriptives in the corpus (F (/, 24) = 3.830, p = .06). The instructors in the Monitor-Constrained condition produced less descriptives, which give information about relations among features in the environment and tap perceptual experience (&amp;quot;you will see a bridge&amp;quot;). In particular, in the Monitor- Constrained condition, 4.7% of instructions were descriptives, whereas the proportion of descriptives averaged /0% in all other conditions. 4 Discussion The results resonate with previous research. The actions of the followers served as an immediate, accurate and effortless indicator of their current state of understanding, making verbal feedback redundant. Monitor instructors could readily confirm their assumptions about the information requirements of followers and used linguistics shortcuts and simpler instructions exactly at the moment needed. On the other hand, in the No Monitor condition, uncertainty about the position and movement of the robot created the need for elaborate and explicit instructions. The contribution of the present study lies on that it grounds these observations on quantitative analysis, using measures like words, turns and the relative frequencies of certain types of instruction components that vary in information value. Most importantly, it describes the specific ways in which instructors configure their directions in the presence/absence of visual information. The CORK framework predicts that route protocols which are rich in descriptives and relational terms are associated with more successful navigation, compared to simple directional ones. Our results partially meet this expectation, since large numbers of execution errors and nonunderstandings were only observed in the Monitor-Constrained condition, whereas miscommunication rates were similar across the other groups. Indeed, this condition was found to generally differ from the rest. In particular, In the Monitor-Constrained condition, the dialogues were the shortest in terms of words. Instructors produced many but short instructions. The component-based analysis revealed that they employed overwhelmingly more action-based instructions without landmark references and descriptives. Boundary information on the route, frame of reference and spatial relations between environmental features were typically omitted. In both Constrained conditions, followers were expected to resort to a &amp;quot;mechanical&amp;quot; interaction, as coerced by the presence of the predefined responses. Inspection of the dialogues revealed that followers in the Monitor-Constrained condition did so, given the precedence of visual feedback. This was not the case with No Monitor- Constrained followers who needed to verbally ground information. Dialogue examples are provided in Table 2 below. Table 2. Dialogue excerpts from the Monitor- Constrained (column /) and No Monitor-Constrained (column 2) conditions. Thus, we propose that the linguistic choices of the followers &amp;quot;prime&amp;quot; the instructor&apos;s own strategies. In the Monitor-Constrained Condition, followers were less interactive, and gave fewer responses with lower information value. In harmony, their partners provided less elaborate instructions, which also lacked important information and specificity. In conclusion, the findings confirm our initial hypotheses. Instructions are sensitive to conditions of (visual) co-presence. Moreover, a direct link was identified between the way in which instructions and follower&apos;s contributions are formulated. Following this lead, we are now focusing on a fine-grained analysis of the utterances of the follower.</abstract>
