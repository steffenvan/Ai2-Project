This paper describes SYSTRAN submissions
for the shared task of the third Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation at ACL. Our
main contribution consists in a French-English
statistical model trained without the use of any
human-translated parallel corpus. In substitu-
tion, we translated a monolingual corpus with
SYSTRAN rule-based translation engine to
produce the parallel corpus. The results are
provided herein, along with a measure of error

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999799107142857">
Current machine translation systems follow two
different lines of research: (1) manually written
rules associated with bilingual dictionaries (rule-
based systems), (2) a statistical framework (statis-
tical machine translation) based on large amount of
monolingual and parallel corpora. The first line
uses linguistically generalized information based
on what humans understand from what happens in
a given language (source and target) and what hap-
pens in the translation process. The translation
process is building a translation from a given
source sentence based on this knowledge. The sec-
ond line exploits implicit information present in
already translated corpora and more generally any
text production in the target language to automati-
cally find the most likely translation for a given
source sentence. This approach has proven to be
competitive with the rule-based approach when
provided with enough resources on a specific do-
main. Though based on fundamentally different
paradigms and exploiting different types of infor-
mation, these two research lines are not in opposi-
tion and may be combined to produce improved
results. For instance, serial combination of the two
approaches has produced very good results in
WMT07 (Simard, 2007), (Dugast, 2007) and
NIST07 (Ueffing, 2008). (Schwenk et al., 2008)
also combines both approaches and resources to
build a better system.
The SYSTRAN’s R&amp;D team actually works to
merge these two approaches, drawing benefit from
their respective strengths. Initially, the SYSTRAN
system was a pure rule-based system that in recent
years began integrating statistical features and cor-
pus-based model (Senellart, 2006). It must be
noted that, for sake of simplification of the ex-
periment and its interpretation, the base system
mentioned in this paper is a purely rule-based ver-
sion. In the framework of this research effort, vari-
ous exploratory experiments are being run which
aim both at finding efficient combination setups
and at discriminating strengths and weaknesses of
rule-based and statistical systems.
We had performed a first analysis on a statistical
post-editing system (Dugast, 2007). The system
submitted for Czech-English follows this setup.
We present also here an original French-English
statistical model which doesn’t make use of the
target side of the parallel data to train its phrase-
table, but rather uses the rule-based translation of
the source side. We call this system “SYSTRAN
Relearnt” because, as far as the translation model
is concerned, this system is a statistical model of
the rule-based engine. In addition to the submitted
system which only makes use of the Europarl
monolingual data, we present additional results

If the need in terms of monolingual corpus to
build language models can most of the time be ful-
filled without much problem, the reliance of statis-
tical models on parallel corpora is much more
problematic. Work on domain adaptation for statis-
tical machine translation (Koehn and Schroeder,
2007) tries to bring solutions to this issue. Statisti-
cal Post-Editing may well be another way to per-
form efficient domain-adaptation, but still requires
parallel corpora. We try here to open a new path.
Our submitted system for French-English on the
Europarl task is a phrase based system, whose
phrase table was trained on the rule based transla-
tion of the French Europarl corpus. The French
side of the Europarl parallel corpus was translated
with the baseline rule-based translation engine to
produce the target side of the training data. How-
ever, the language model was trained on the real
English Europarl data provided for the shared task.
Training was otherwise performed according to
baseline recommendations.

An additional (non-submitted) system was
trained using two monolingual news corpora of
approximately a million sentences. The French
corpus was built from a leading French newspaper,
the English from a leading American newspaper,
both of the same year (1995). In the previous
model, the English corpus used to train the lan-
guage model actually contained the reference
translations of the source corpus. This is not the
case here. As for the previous model, the French
corpus was translated by the rule-based system to
produce the parallel training data, while the Eng-
lish corpus was used to train a language model,.
This same language model is used in both statisti-
cal models: a relearnt system and a baseline
phrase-based model whose phrase table was learnt
from the Europarl parallel data. Both trainings fol-
lowed the baseline recommendations of the shared
task.

We provide here results on evaluation metrics,

Table 3 provides metrics results for four different
systems : purely rule based, purely statistical, and
the relearnt systems: Relearnt-0 is a plain statisti-
cal model of systran, while Relearnt uses a real
English language model and is tuned on real Eng-

Comparing these three systems may help
us discriminate between the statistical nature of a
translation system and the fact it was trained on the
relevant domain. For this purpose, we defined 11
error types and counted occurrences for 100 ran-
dom-picked sentences of the devtest2006 test cor-
pus for the three following systems : a baseline
phrase-based system, a SYSTRAN relearnt phrase-
based system and the baseline SYSTRAN rule-

Such results lead us to make the following com-
ments, regarding the various error types:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.816285">
• Missing words
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996064">
This type of error seems to be specific to statis-
tical systems (counts are close between re-
learnt and baseline Moses) . Although we do
not have evidence for that, we guess that it is
especially impairing adequacy when content
words are concerned.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.932024">
• Extra words
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.6845534">
Obviously, the rule-based output produces
many useless functional words (determiners,
prepositions...) while statistical systems do not
have this problem that much. However, they
may also produce extra content words..
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.954968">
• Unknown words
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982796">
Few words are out of the rule-based dictionar-
ies’ vocabulary. Morphological analysis may
explain at least part of this.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992044">
• Translation choice
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999516777777778">
Translation choice is the major strength of the
statistical model. Note that the relearnt system
gains a great deal of the difference between
Systran and Moses in this category. We would
expect the remaining difference to require
more translation choices (which may be learnt
from a parallel corpus). Inflection errors re-
main low for the rule-based system only,
thanks to its morphological module.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.976215">
• Word Order
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873230769231">
The language model couldn’t lower the num-
ber of short-distance word-order errors (no dif-
ference between SYSTRAN and SYSTRAN
relearnt). Long-distance word order is, as ex-
pected, better for the rule-based output, though
French-English is not known to be especially
sensitive to this issue.
Additionally, table 6 shows the results of the re-
learnt system we trained using only monolingual
corpus. It performed better than both the europarl-
trained phrase-based model and the baseline rule-
based engine. Table 7 shows the three different
translations of a same example French sentence.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991433333333">
The relearnt experiment primary goal was to
set-up a comparison between three different sys-
tems, with equivalent resources. This experiment
showed that a statistical translation system may be
granted a high BLEU score, even if its translation
model was not extracted from corpus. It remains
to be seen how this correlates with human judg-
ment (Callison-Burch, 2006), but the detailed error
analysis we performed already shows improve-
ments for important categories of errors.
This experiment provided us with some new in-
sight on the strengths and weaknesses of rule-
based and phrase-based systems. As an intermedi-
ate between a purely corpus-based statistical sys-
tem and a rule-based system, this setup could
benefit from some of the strengths of a phrase-
based statistical system, though at the expense of
its known drawbacks.
As future work, we may pursue in this direction
by exploring the effect of the size of the monolin-
gual corpus used for training the translation model.
We may also refine the model by using the target
side of the parallel training data when building the
language model corpus (to avoid a mismatch of
vocabularies) and also combine such a model with
the translation model(s) trained on whatever paral-
lel data is available. This would then be interesting
to compare this strategy with the corpus-based-
only strategies that make use of smaller in-domain
parallel corpora.
