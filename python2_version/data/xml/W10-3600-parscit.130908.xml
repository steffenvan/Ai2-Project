Welcome to the Coling Workshop on South and Southeast Asian Natural Language Processing
(WSSANLP).
South Asia comprises of the countries- Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Southeast Asia, on the other hand, consists of Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, East
Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
There thousands of languages that belong to different language families like Indo-Aryan, Indo-
Iranian, Dravidian, Sino-Tibetan, Austro-Asiatic, Kradai, Hmong-Mien, etc. In terms of population,
South Asia and Southeast Asia represent 34.94 percent of the total population of the world. Some of
the languages of these regions have a large number of native speakers: Hindi (5th largest according to
number of its native speakers), Bengali (6th), Punjabi (12th), Tamil (18th), Urdu (20th), etc.
A characteristic of these languages is that they are under-resourced. But the words of these
languages show rich variations in morphology. Moreover they are often heavily agglutinated and
synthetic, making segmentation an important issue. The intellectual motivation for this workshop
comes from the need to explore ways of harnessing the morphology of these Source (Lewis, 2009)
languages for higher level processing. Table 1: Population and Number of Living Languages of The
task of morphology, however, is South and Southeast Asia intimately linked with segmentation for
these languages.
The goal of WSSANLP is:
Providing a platform to linguistic and NLP communities for sharing and discussing ideas and work on
South and Southeast Asian languages and combining efforts.
Development of useful and high quality computational resources for under resourced South and
Southeast Asian languages.
We are delighted to present you this volume of proceedings of 1st Workshop on South and
Southeast Asian NLP. We have received total 18 long and short paper submissions. On the basis of our
review process, we have competitively selected 13 papers, but unfortunately 6 papers were withdrawn
from the workshop due to double submission and authors chose to present their paper in other events.
We hope that we will be able to make this workshop so successful that people would like to present
their papers in this workshop in future.
