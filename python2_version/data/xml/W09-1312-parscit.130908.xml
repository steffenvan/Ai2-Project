<bodyText confidence="0.9822080625">
In this paper we present an extractive system that au-
tomatically generates gene summaries from the biomed-
ical literature. The proposed text summarization system
selects and ranks sentences from multiple MEDLINE
abstracts by exploiting gene-specific information and
similarity relationships between sentences. We evaluate
our system on a large dataset of 7,294 human genes and
187,628 MEDLINE abstracts using Recall-Oriented
Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), a widely
used automatic evaluation metric in the text summariza-
tion community. Two baseline methods are used for
comparison. Experimental results show that our system
significantly outperforms the other two methods with
regard to all ROUGE metrics. A demo website of our
system is freely accessible at

Entrez Gene is a database for gene-centric infor-
mation maintained at the National Center for Bio-
technology Information (NCBI). It includes genes
from completely sequenced genomes (e.g. Homo
sapiens). An important part of a gene record is the
summary field (shown in Table 1), which is a small
piece of text that provides a quick synopsis of what
is known about the gene, the function of its en-
coded protein or RNA products, disease associa-
tions, genetic interactions, etc. The summary field,
when available, can help biologists to understand
the target gene quickly by compressing a huge
amount of knowledge from many papers to a small
piece of text. At present, gene summaries are gen-
erated manually by the National Library of Medi-
cine (NLM) curators, a time- and labor-intensive
process. A previous study has concluded that ma-
nual curation is not sufficient for annotation of ge-
nomic databases (Baumgartner et al., 2007).
Indeed, of the 5 million genes currently in Entrez
Gene, only about 20,000 genes have a correspond-
ing summary. Even in humans, arguably the most
important species, the coverage is modest: only 26%
of human genes are curated in this regard. The goal
of this work is to develop and evaluate computa-
tional techniques towards automatic generation of
gene summaries.
To this end, we developed a text summarization
system that takes as input MEDLINE documents
related to a given target gene and outputs a small
set of genic information rich sentences. Specifical-
ly, it first preprocesses and filters sentences that do

This gene spans approximately 18 kb of genomic DNA and consists of 12 ex-
ons. Alternative splice patterns in the 5\&apos; UTR result in three transcript variants
encoding the same extracellular matrix protein. Mutations in this gene are asso-
ciated with Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy.
The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for interleukin 20 (IL20), a cyto-
kine that may be involved in epidermal function. The receptor of IL20 is a hete-
rodimeric receptor complex consisting of this protein and interleukin 20
receptor beta (IL20B). This gene and IL20B are highly expressed in skin. The
expression of both genes is found to be upregulated in Psoriasis.

not include enough informative words for gene
summaries. Next, the remaining sentences are
ranked by the sum of two individual scores: a) an
authority score from a lexical PageRank algorithm
(Erkan and Radev, 2004) and b) a similarity score
between the sentence and the Gene Ontology (GO)
terms with which the gene is annotated (To date,
over 190,000 genes have two or more associated
GO terms). Finally, redundant sentences are re-
moved and top ranked sentences are nominated for
the target gene.
In order to evaluate our system, we assembled a
gold standard dataset consisting of handwritten
summaries for 7,294 human genes and conducted
an intrinsic evaluation by measuring the amount of
overlap between the machine-selected sentences
and human-written summaries. Our metric for the
evaluation was ROUGE1, a widely used intrinsic
summarization evaluation metric.

Summarization systems aim to extract salient text
fragments, especially sentences, from the original
documents to form a summary. A number of me-
thods for sentence scoring and ranking have been
developed. Approaches based on sentence position
(Edmundson, 1969), cue phrase (McKeown and
Radev, 1995), word frequency (Teufel and Moens,
1997), and discourse segmentation (Boguraev and
Kennedy, 1997) have been reported. Radev et al.
(Radev et al., 2004) developed an extractive multi-
document summarizer, MEAD, which extracts a
summary from multiple documents based on the
document cluster centroid, position and first-
sentence overlap. Recently, graph-based ranking
methods, such as LexPageRank (Erkan and Radev,
2004) and TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004),

have been proposed for multi-document summari-
zation. Similar to the original PageRank algorithm,
these methods make use of similarity relationships
between sentences and then rank sentences accord-
ing to the “votes” or “recommendations” from
their neighboring sentences.
Lin and Hovy (2000) first introduced topic sig-
natures which are topic relevant terms for summa-
rization. Afterwards, this technique was
successfully used in a number of summarization
systems (Hickl et al., 2007, Gupta and Nenkova et
al., 2007). In order to improve sentence selection,
we adopted the idea in a similar way to identify
terms that tend to appear frequently in gene sum-
maries and subsequently filter sentences that in-
clude none or few such terms.
Compared with newswire document summariza-
tion, much less attention has been paid to summa-
rizing MEDLINE documents for genic information.
Ling et al. (Ling et al., 2006 and 2007) presented
an automatic gene summary generation system that
constructs a summary based on six aspects of a
gene, such as gene products, mutant phenotype, etc.
In their system, sentences were ranked according
to a) the relevance to each category (namely the
aspect), b) the relevance to the document where
they are from; and c) the position where sentences
are located. Although the system performed well
on a small group of genes (10~20 genes) from Fly-
base, their method relied heavily on high-quality
training data that is often hard to obtain in practice.
Yang et al. reported a system (Yang et al., 2007
and 2009) that produces gene summaries by focus-
ing on gene sets from microarray experiments.
Their system first clustered gene set into functional
related groups based on free text, Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH®) and Gene Ontology (GO) fea-
tures. Then, an extractive summary was generated
for each gene following the Edmundson paradigm

<bodyText confidence="0.999033967741936">
(Edmundson, 1969). Yang et al. also presented
evaluation results based on human ratings of eight
gene summaries.
Another related work is the second task of Text
REtrieval Conference 2 (TREC) 2003 Genomics
Track. Participants in the track were required to
extract GeneRIFs from MEDLINE abstracts
(Hersh and Bhupatiraju, 2003). Many teams ap-
proached the task as a sentence classification prob-
lem using GeneRIFs in the Entrez database as
training data (Bhalotia et al., 2003; Jelier et al.,
2003). This task has also been approached as a sin-
gle document summarization problem (Lu et al.,
2006).
The gene summarization work presented here
differs from the TREC task in that it deals with
multiple documents. In contrast to the previously
described systems for gene summarization, our
approach has three novel features. First, we are
able to summarize all aspects of gene-specific in-
formation as opposed to a limited number of prede-
termined aspects. Second, we exploit a lexical
PageRank algorithm to establish similarity rela-
tionships between sentences. The importance of a
sentence is based not only on the sentence itself,
but also on its neighbors in a graph representation.
Finally, we conducted an intrinsic evaluation on a
large publicly available dataset. The gold standard
assembled in this work makes it possible for com-
parisons between different gene summarization
systems without human judgments.

To determine if a sentence is extract worthy, we
consider three different aspects: (1) the number of
salient or informative words that are frequently
used by human curators for writing gene summa-
ries; (2) the relative importance of a sentence to be
included in a gene summary; (3) the gene-specific
information that is unique between different genes.
Specifically, we look for signature terms in
handwritten summaries for the first aspect. Ideally,
computer generated summaries should resemble
handwritten summaries. Thus the terms used by
human curators should also occur frequently in
automatically generated summaries. In this regard,
we use a method similar to Lin and Hovy (2000) to
identify signature terms and subsequently use them

<bodyText confidence="0.99998075">
to discard sentences that contain none or few such
terms. For the second aspect, we adopt a lexical
PageRank method to compute the sentence impor-
tance with a graph representation. For the last as-
pect, we treat each gene as having its own
properties that distinguish it from others. To reflect
such individual differences in the machine-
generated summaries, we exploit a gene’s GO an-
notations as a surrogate for its unique properties
and look for their occurrence in abstract sentences.
Our gene summarization system consists of
three components: a preprocessing module, a sen-
tence ranking module, and a redundancy removal
and summary generation module. Given a target
gene, the preprocessing module retrieves corres-
ponding MEDLINE abstracts and GO terms ac-
cording to the gene2pubmed and gene2go data
provided by Entrez Gene. Then the abstracts are
split into sentences by the MEDLINE sentence
splitter in the LingPipe3 toolkit. The sentence rank-
ing module takes these as input and first filters out
some non-informative sentences. The remaining
sentences are then scored according to a linear
combination of the PageRank score and GO relev-
ance score. Finally, a gene summary is generated
after redundant sentences are removed. The system
is illustrated in Figure 1 and is described in more
detail in the following sections.

about cooking or restaurants. Similarly, there are
signature terms for gene summaries.
We use the Pearson’s chi-square test (Manning
and Schütze, 1999) to extract topic signature terms
from a set of handwritten summaries by comparing
the occurrence of terms in the handwritten summa-
ries with that of randomly selected MEDLINE ab-
stracts. Let R denote the set of handwritten
�
summaries and R denote the set of randomly se-
lected abstracts from MEDLINE. The null hypo-
thesis and alternative hypothesis are as follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.485239714285714">
The null hypothesis says that the term ti appears
�
in Rand in R with an equal probability and ti is
independent from R . In contrast, the alternative
hypothesis says that the term ti is correlated with
R . We construct the following 2-by-2 contingency
table:

be selected as signature terms. In total, we obtained
1,169 unigram terms. The top ranked (by X2 value)

signature terms are discarded. This parameter was

3.2 Lexical PageRank Scoring
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995953666666667">
The lexical PageRank algorithm makes use of the
similarity between sentences and ranks them by
how similar a sentence is to all other sentences. It
originates from the original PageRank algorithm
(Page et al., 1998) that is based on the following
two hypotheses:

other pages.
(2) A web page is important if it is linked by im-

<bodyText confidence="0.95959944">
The algorithm views the entire internet as a large
graph in which a web page is a vertex and a di-
rected edge is connected according to the linkage.
The salience of a vertex can be computed by a ran-
dom walk on the graph. Such graph-based methods
have been widely adapted to such Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) problems as text summa-
rization and word sense disambiguation. The
advantage of such graph-based methods is obvious:
the importance of a vertex is not only decided by
itself, but also by its neighbors in a graph represen-
tation. The random walk on a graph can imply
more global dependence than other methods. Our
PageRank scoring method consists of two steps:
constructing the sentence graph and computing the
salience score for each vertex of the graph.
Let S = {si |1 &lt;_ i &lt;_ N} be the sentence collec-
tion containing all the sentences to be summarized.
According to the vector space model (Salton et al.,
1975), each sentence si can be represented by a
G
vector si with each component being the weight of
a term in si . The weight associated with a term w
is calculated by tf (w)* isf (w) , where tf (w) is the
frequency of the term win sentence si and isf (w)

Taking each sentence as a vertex, and the simi-

graph is fully connected and undirected because
the similarity score is symmetric.
The sentence graph can be modeled by an adja-

ponds to the weight of an edge in the graph. Thus

Up to this point, our system considers only gene-
independent features, in both sentence filtering and
PageRank-based sentence scoring. These features
are universal across different genes. However, each
gene is unique because of its own functional and
structural properties. Thus we seek to include
gene-specific features in this next step.
The GO annotations provide one kind of gene-
specific information and have been shown to be
useful for selecting GeneRIF candidates (Lu et al.,

The GO relevance score is computed as follows:
first, the GO terms and the sentences are both
stemmed an
d stopwords are removed. For example,
the GO terms in Table 4 are processed into a set of

Second, the total number of occurrence of the
GO terms appearing in a sentence is counted. Fi-
nally, the GO relevance score is computed as the
ratio of the total occurrence to the sentence length.
The entire process can be illustrated by the follow-
ing pseudo codes:
where length (si ) is the number of distinct non-stop
words in si . For each sentence si , the GO relev-
ance score is combined with the PageRank score to
get the overall score (α is a weight parameter be-

A good summary contains as much diverse infor-

much information is redundant. Hence it is neces-

We adopt the diversity penalty method (Zhang

Unlike the newswire summarization, there are no
gold-standard test collections available for evaluat-
ing gene summarization systems. The two previous
studies mentioned in Section 2 both conducted ex-
trinsic evaluations by asking human experts to rate
system outputs. Although it is important to collect
direct feedback from the users, involving human
experts makes it difficult to compare different
summarization systems and to conduct large-scale
evaluations (both studies evaluated nothing but a
small number of genes). In contrast, we evaluated
our system intrinsically on a much larger dataset
. consisting of 7,294 human genes, each with a pre-
existing handwritten summary downloaded from
the NCBI’s FTP site5.
The handwritten summaries were used as refer-
ence summaries (i.e. a gold standard) to compare
with the automatically generated summaries. Al-
though the length of reference summaries varies,
the majority of these summaries contain 80 to 120
words. To produce a summary of similar length,
we decided to select five sentences consisting of
about 100 words.
For the intrinsic evaluation of a large number of
summaries, we made use of the ROUGE metrics
that has been widely used in automatic evaluation
of summarization systems (Lin and Hovy, 2003;
Hickl et al., 2007). It provides a set of evaluation
metrics to measure the quality of a summary by
counting overlapping units such as n-grams or
word sequences between the generated summary
and its reference summary.

We computed three ROUGE measures for each
summary, namely ROUGE-1 (unigram based),
ROUGE-2 (bigram based) and ROUGE-SU4
(skip-bigram and unigram) (Lin and Hovy, 2003).
Among them, ROUGE-1 has been shown to agree
most with human judgments (Lin and Hovy, 2003).
However, as biomedical concepts usually contain
more than one word (e.g. transcription factor),
ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4 scores are also im-
portant for assessing gene summaries.

The two important parameters in our system – the
linear coefficient α for the combination of Page-
Rank and GO scores and the diversity penalty de-
gree factor ω in redundancy removal – are
investigated in detail on a collection of 100 ran-
domly selected genes. First, by setting α to values
from 0 to 1 with an increment of 0.1 while holding
ω steady at 0.7, we observed the highest ROUGE-
1score when α was 0.8 (Figure 2). This suggests
that the two scores (i.e. PageRank and GO score)
complement to each other and that the PageRank
score plays a more dominating role in the summed
score. Next, we variedω gradually from 0 to 5 with
an increment of 0.25 while holding α steady at
0.75.The highest ROUGE-1 score was achieved
whenω was 1.3 (Figure 3). For ROURE-2, the best
performance was obtained when α was 0.7 and ω
was 0.5. In order to balance ROUGE-1 and
ROUGE-2 scores, we setα to 0.75 and ω to 0.7
for the remaining experiments.

Because there are no publicly available gene sum-
marization systems, we compared our system with
two baseline methods. The first is a well known
publicly available summarizer - MEAD (Radev et
al., 2004). We adopted the latest version of MEAD
3.11 and used the default setting in MEAD that
extracts sentences according to three features: cen-
troid, position and length. The second baseline ex-
tracts different sentences randomly from abstracts.
Comparison results are shown in the following ta-
ble:
As shown in Table 5, our system significantly
outperformed the two baseline systems in all three
ROUGE measures. Furthermore, larger perfor-
mance gains are observed in ROUGE-2 and
ROUGE-SU4 than in ROUGE-1. This is because
many background words (e.g. gene, protein and
enzyme) also appeared frequently as unigrams in
randomly selected summaries.

In Figure 4, we show that the majority of the
summaries have a ROUGE-1 score greater than 0.4.
Our further analysis revealed that almost half
summaries with a low score (smaller than 0.3) ei-
ther lacked sufficient relevant abstracts, or the ref-
erence summary was too short or too long. In
either case, only few overlapping words can be
found when comparing the generated gene sum-
mary with the reference. The statistics for low
ROUGE-1 score are listed in Table 6. We also note
that almost half of the summaries that have low
ROUGE-1 scores were due to other causes: mostly,
machine generated summaries differ from human
summaries in that they describe different function-
al aspects of the same gene product. Take the gene
TOP2A (ID: 7153) for example. While both sum-
maries (handwritten and machine generated) focus
on its encoded protein DNA topoisomerase, the
handwritten summary describes the chromosome
location of the gene whereas our algorithm selects
statements about its gene expression when treated
with a chemotherapy agent. We plan to investigate
such differences further in our future work.

Figure 5 shows the variations of ROUGE scores as
the summary length increases. At all lengths and
for both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 measures, our
proposed method performed better than the two
baseline methods. By investigating the scores of
different summary lengths, it can be seen that the
advantage of our method is greater when the sum-

5 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999720888888889">
In this paper we have presented a system for gene-
rating gene summaries by automatically finding
extract-worthy sentences from the biomedical lite-
rature. By using the state-of-the-art summarization
techniques and incorporating gene specific annota-
tions, our system is able to generate gene summa-
ries more accurately than the baseline methods.
Note that we only evaluated our system for human
genes in this work. More summaries are available
for human genes than other organisms, but our me-
thod is organism-independent and can be applied
to any other species.
This research has implications for real-world
applications such as assisting manual database cu-
ration or updating existing gene records. The
ROUGE scores in our evaluation show comparable
performance to those in the newswire summariza-
tion (Hickl et al., 2007). Nonetheless, there are
further steps necessary before making our system
output readily usable by human curators. For in-
stance, human curators are generally in favor of
sentences presented in a coherent order. Thus, in-
formation-ordering algorithms in multi-document
summarization need to be investigated. We also
plan to study the guidelines and scope of the cura-
tion process, which may provide additional impor-
tant heuristics to further refine our system output.

At present, gene summaries are generated manually by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) curators, a time- and labor-intensive process. A previous study has concluded that manual curation is not sufficient for annotation of genomic databases (Baumgartner et al., 2007). Indeed, of the 5 million genes currently in Entrez Gene, only about 20,000 genes have a corresponding summary. Even in humans, arguably the most important species, the coverage is modest: only 26% of human genes are curated in this regard. The goal of this work is to develop and evaluate computational techniques towards automatic generation of gene summaries. To this end, we developed a text summarization system that takes as input MEDLINE documents related to a given target gene and outputs a small set of genic information rich sentences.

The handwritten summaries were used as reference summaries (i.e. a gold standard) to compare with the automatically generated summaries. Although the length of reference summaries varies, the majority of these summaries contain 80 to 120 words. To produce a summary of similar length, we decided to select five sentences consisting of about 100 words. For the intrinsic evaluation of a large number of summaries, we made use of the ROUGE metrics that has been widely used in automatic evaluation of summarization systems (Lin and Hovy, 2003; Hickl et al., 2007).

Note that we only evaluated our system for human genes in this work. More summaries are available for human genes than other organisms, but our method is organism-independent and can be applied to any other species. This research has implications for real-world applications such as assisting manual database curation or updating existing gene records. The ROUGE scores in our evaluation show comparable performance to those in the newswire summarization (Hickl et al., 2007). Nonetheless, there are further steps necessary before making our system output readily usable by human curators. For instance, human curators are generally in favor of sentences presented in a coherent order. Thus, information-ordering algorithms in multi-document summarization need to be investigated. We also plan to study the guidelines and scope of the curation process, which may provide additional important heuristics to further refine our system output.

It originates from the original PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1998) that is based on the following two hypotheses: (1) A web page is important if it is linked by many other pages. (2) A web page is important if it is linked by important pages. The algorithm views the entire internet as a large graph in which a web page is a vertex and a directed edge is connected according to the linkage. The salience of a vertex can be computed by a random walk on the graph. Such graph-based methods have been widely adapted to such Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems as text summarization and word sense disambiguation.

This guarantees that the stochastic transition matrix for iteration is irreducible and aperiodic. Therefore the ri 1/ (1 − ⋅U thm converges, each component in the column vector p corresponds to the salience score of the corresponding sentence. This score is combined with the GO relevance score to rank sentences. 3.3 GO Relevance Scoring iteration can converge to a stable state. In our implementation, the damping factor d is set to 0.85 as in the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1998). The column vector p is initialized with random values between 0 and 1.

Our metric for the evaluation was ROUGE1, a widely used intrinsic summarization evaluation metric. 2 Related Work Summarization systems aim to extract salient text fragments, especially sentences, from the original documents to form a summary. A number of methods for sentence scoring and ranking have been developed. Approaches based on sentence position (Edmundson, 1969), cue phrase (McKeown and Radev, 1995), word frequency (Teufel and Moens, 1997), and discourse segmentation (Boguraev and Kennedy, 1997) have been reported. Radev et al. (Radev et al., 2004) developed an extractive multidocument summarizer, MEAD, which extracts a summary from multiple documents based on the document cluster centroid, position and firstsentence overlap. Recently, graph-based ranking methods, such as LexPageRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) and TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), 1 http://haydn.isi.edu/ROUGE/ have been proposed for multi-document summarization.

In order to balance ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores, we setα to 0.75 and ω to 0.7 for the remaining experiments. Figure 2. The blue line represents the changes in ROUGE-1 scores with different values of α while ω is held at 0.7. Figure 3. The blue line represents the changes in ROUGE-1 scores with different values of ω while α is held at 0.75. 4.3 Comparison with other methods Because there are no publicly available gene summarization systems, we compared our system with two baseline methods. The first is a well known publicly available summarizer - MEAD (Radev et al., 2004). We adopted the latest version of MEAD 3.11 and used the default setting in MEAD that extracts sentences according to three features: centroid, position and length. The second baseline extracts different sentences randomly from abstracts. Comparison results are shown in the following table: As shown in Table 5, our system significantly outperformed the two baseline systems in all three ROUGE measures. Furthermore, larger performance gains are observed in ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4 than in ROUGE-1. This is because many background words (e.g. gene, protein and enzyme) also appeared frequently as uni</context>

The advantage of such graph-based methods is obvious: the importance of a vertex is not only decided by itself, but also by its neighbors in a graph representation. The random walk on a graph can imply more global dependence than other methods. Our PageRank scoring method consists of two steps: constructing the sentence graph and computing the salience score for each vertex of the graph. Let S = {si |1 &lt;_ i &lt;_ N} be the sentence collection containing all the sentences to be summarized. According to the vector space model (Salton et al., 1975), each sentence si can be represented by a G vector si with each component being the weight of a term in si .

Although the system performed well on a small group of genes (10~20 genes) from Flybase, their method relied heavily on high-quality training data that is often hard to obtain in practice. Yang et al. reported a system (Yang et al., 2007 and 2009) that produces gene summaries by focusing on gene sets from microarray experiments. Their system first clustered gene set into functional related groups based on free text, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH®) and Gene Ontology (GO) features. Then, an extractive summary was generated for each gene following the Edmundson paradigm 98 (Edmundson, 1969).
