<bodyText confidence="0.999927166666667">
Multilingual generation is becoming an
increasingly important aspect of imple-
mented systems that showcase the abil-
ities of generation systems. Most such
systems require multiple grammars, one
for each language which must be de-
ployed. Yet little is known about the
development costs for additional lan-
guages which are developed not from
scratch, but by adapting existing re-
sources. We ported a standard En-
glish surface realizer and grammar with
wide coverage to Italian. After describ-
ing major grammatical differences, we
quantitatively specify the porting pro-
cess and present statistical information
for the changes we found necessary to
develop the new grammar.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999696177777778">
Multilingual generation systems will play increas-
ingly important roles in showcasing the abilities
of deep NLG (Paris et al., 1995; Stede, 1996;
Callaway et al., 1999; Scott, 1999). These sys-
tems require an array of resources that can func-
tion regardless of the language selected, such as
discourse and sentence planning rules, lexica, and
pronominalization strategies. One of the most
important of these resources is the grammar that
a surface realizer uses to produce linearized text
from a syntactic sentence plan, and multilingual
systems must use a distinct grammar for each de-
sired language.
While many multilingual systems have either
developed grammars from scratch or borrowed
them from other projects, relatively few projects
have focused on reworking existing grammars to
port them to new languages. Most such work
has been connected with the KPML environment
(Bateman, 1997; Aguado et al., 1998; Kruijff et
al., 2000), and the newer EXPRIMO system devel-
oped at Edinburgh and based on ILEX (OberIan-
der et al., 1998). However, these projects have
not addressed the issue of exactly how much ef-
fort is involved in converting a surface realizer for
one language into another in a quantitative man-
ner. And while (Callaway et al., 1999) presented
basic data on an English to Spanish project, it was
not comprehensive enough to allow future projects
to accurately estimate what potential development
costs might be.
A separate trend has been to justify as both
useful and cost-effective the continued use of
resources in investigating deep natural language
generation over other, more near-term approaches
such as template generation. In order to make
an informed comparison, hard data is needed on
the costs for developing and maintaining projects
which use both formalisms. In this article, we pro-
vide such data for the grammar and morphology
development of an Italian surface realizer as a fi rst
step in allowing such comparisons to be made.
During the course of work on a multilingual
generation system for English and Italian, we
took elements from both the original FuF/SuRGE

well as a less-developed Spanish version (Call-
away et al., 1999) of that same realizer to create
a new Italian versionl . The porting process in-
volved changes to morphology, linearization, and
the grammar, while leaving unchanged other fea-
tures of the FUF system such as formatting and
effi cienT directives. This paper presents the re-
sults of creating the new surface realizer, includ-

guages and a quantitative analysis of the effort and

2 Examples of Language Differences
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997784583333333">
The differences between Italian and English are
not signifi cantcompared to languages from differ-
ing families. The following areas are indicative
of the types of linguistic changes necessary when
generating Italian text as opposed to English. Ex-
tensive catalogues of such changes for other lan-
guages such as French also exist (Rayner et al.,
1996). The various categories for Italian include:
Morphology Changes that affect the prefi es
and suffi s of words for purposes of agreement,
along with interactions between surface forms af-
ter they have already been syntactically specifi ed.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999764625">
• Irregular Words: Irregulars mainly concern
lexical forms for nouns, verbs, and adjectives
(which have few irregular forms in either En-
glish or Italian). Besides the three most im-
portant, regular rules for Italian noun plural-
ization (-o/-i, -a/-e, -e/-i), there are more than
20 other minor rules for pluralization (e.g.,
nouns with accented endings: sing. crisi, pl.
crisi) and a third category of completely ir-
regular plurals (e.g., sing. tempi°, pl. tern-
ph). Furthermore, while English can express
all verbs with at most five basic forms plus
auxiliaries, Italian verbs can have up to 49
different irregular forms.
• Contractions: Italian can form contractions
between a preposition and a defi nite article,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994224222222222">
such as su + la = sulla (&amp;quot; on&apos;IF &amp;quot; the&apos;).Addi-
tionally, contractions can occur between cer-
tain proclitic pronouns and verbs beginning
with a vowel or &apos;h&apos; plus a vowel (e.g., l&apos;ho
vista &amp;quot; Ihave seen her&amp;quot;, or c &amp;quot; thereis&apos;).
There are also rules for dropping unstressed
vowels, especially after infi nitifes: aver detto
rather than avere detto, or with enclitic pro-
nouns: fare+lo = farlo &amp;quot; talo it&amp;quot;.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.885360461538462">
Word Order Differences in relative positioning
of certain syntactic categories with respect to oth-
ers and co-occurrence constraints.
• Adjectives: Adjectives in Italian can be
found in pre-nominal or post-nominal posi-
tion. Some adjectives allow only one posi-
tion, so a feature &amp;quot; pre-n&amp;quot;or &amp;quot; post-n&amp;quot;must
be added to the lexicon. Lots of adjectives
can appear in both positions, causing the dis-
tinction between their appositive and restric-
tive use. Since some adjectives change their
meaning completely according to their posi-
tion,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.893937285714286">
La vecchia strada La strada vecchia
(lit, the old street) (lit, the street old)
&amp;quot; Thcfamiliar street&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Thcold street&amp;quot;
this requires that they be listed as different
lexical items. Further order constraints arise
when more than one adjective determines a
nominal head:
Un nuovo cinema italiano
(lit, a new cinema Italian)
Un cinema italiano nuovo
(lit, a cinema Italian new)
*un cinema nuovo italiano
(lit, a cinema new Italian)
&amp;quot;A new Italian cinema&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962653142857143">
• Subject Position: Subject in Italian can occur
either in preverbal or postverbal position. It
generally precedes the verb, but it follows it
with unaccusative and unergative structures:
E&apos; arrivata Laura.
(lit. Is arrived(agr.) Laura.)
&amp;quot; Lauratrrived.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.5812235">
&apos;The resulting grammar is freely available for research Other verbs such as &amp;quot; mancareT)e lacking),

use) strongly prefer the inversion of comple-
ment order:
A Luca piace la pasta.
(lit. (dat-prep.) Luca likes the pasta.)
&amp;quot; Lucdikes pasta.&amp;quot;
The postposition of the subject is also re-
quired with interrogative WH:
Che cosa ha comprato Giorgio?
(lit. What thing has bought Giorgio?)
&amp;quot; Whadid Giorgio buy?&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977674">
• Oitics: Accusative clitics precede the fi nite
verb, while direct objects usually follow it:
</listItem>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.702234">
Mary l&apos;ha letto.
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.946457807692308">
(lit. Mary cl.(acc) has read.)
&amp;quot; Mar3has read it.&amp;quot;
With restructuring verbs, clitics can attach ei-
ther to the main verb or to the infi nitte:
Mary vuole comprarlo.
(lit. Mary wants to buy cl.(acc).)
Mary lo vuole comprare.
(lit. Mary cl.(acc) wants to buy.)
&amp;quot; Maryvants to buy it.&amp;quot;
But clitics follow the verb when the mood is
imperative:
Lo regali a Gianni. (indicative)
(lit. cl.(acc) give to Gianni.)
&amp;quot; (lie it to Gianni.&amp;quot;
Regalalo a Gianni! (imperative)
(lit, give cl.(acc) to Gianni!)
&amp;quot; Cie it to Gianni!&amp;quot;
When both dative and accusative clitic are re-
quired, the order of complements is inverted
(dative precedes accusative):
Mary me lo dice.
(lit. Mary cl.(dat) cl.(acc).)
&amp;quot; Mallen it to me.&amp;quot;
Grammar Modifi cations to choosing which
syntactic categories are allowed in which positions
and what defaults are given to individual features.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99203">
• Secondary Clauses: Sentences where matrix
verbs govern a gerund clause, such as
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.974946363636364">
Ho visto ii ragazzo uscendo dalla chiesa.
(lit, have seen the boy leaving from the
church.)
&amp;quot; aw the boy leaving the church.&amp;quot;
by default prefer to keep the subjects identi-
cal, whereas in English the object of the ma-
trix verb generally corefers to the subject of
the matrix verb by default. Thus where the
boy was leaving the church in the English ex-
ample above, in the Italian version it is the
speaker who was leaving the church.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.924613969696969">
• Formal/polite pronouns: Italian uses the third
person feminine address &amp;quot; Lei&apos;(even when it
is addressed to a male person) instead of the
second person. The use of the polite form in-
volves changes to verbs and pronouns when
the mood is imperative. Indeed, Italian has
imperative forms for the second singular per-
son and second and third plural, but changes
to the subjunctive for polite imperatives, eg.:
Leggi! (imperative)
&amp;quot; Read!&amp;quot;
Legga! (imperative realized by a subjunctive)
&amp;quot; Read!&amp;quot;
Further changes arise from the use of clitics:
Leggilo! (enclitic in familiar form)
&amp;quot; Readt!&amp;quot;
Lo legga! (proclitic in polite form)
&amp;quot; Readt!&amp;quot;
• Verb-governed pronouns: Most notably, da-
tive constructions in Italian are much differ-
ent than those in English. Features in SURGE
like &amp;quot; datie-shift&amp;quot; are not useful and are thus
not referenced in the Italian Grammar.
Discourse Differences in which although a con-
stituent is allowed grammatically, one language
prefers something slightly different.
• Zero pronominalization: Also called pro-
drop (Haegeman, 1994), this is the result of
not mentioning a repetitive subject pronoun,
as it is redundant given that verbs are in-
fl ected for a subject&apos;s number and gender (Di
Eugenio, 1998).

of coverage of a particular language. For example,
the FUF/SURGE surface realizer includes over 500
examples of paired inputs and outputs covering a
wide range of phenomena subdivided into cate-
gories such as yes/no questions, relative clauses,
noun phrases, etc.
Although we did not attempt to duplicate cov-
erage for this extensive test suite, we did obtain
enough coverage to allow for the production of
multiple paragraphs of simple text.
Throughout our efforts, we strove to make the
input representation as similar as possible to the
existing SURGE test suite. An example of this sim-
ilarity is found in Figure 1, where only individual
lexical items differ between the two functional de-
scriptions. Thus the new surface realizer can be
used with existing discourse and sentence plan-
ners, with only changes to the lexicon needed in
a pipelined NLG architecture.
Figure 2 shows a more complex example where
the structures of the sentences are so divergent that
either the sentence planner must be able to gener-
ate different sentential representations or the inter-
face to the surface realizer must be moved even
higher to exclude all syntactic references. For Ital-
ian and English we have seen a higher proportion
of the simple cases in our application environment,
although it is highly likely that the exact propor-
tion changes by language pair.

4 The Porting Process
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923210526316">
Porting the SURGE grammar to Italian was accom-
plished in a systematic way. We fi rstworked on
the morphology of individual words in isolation.
Italian words typically have much more infl ection
than those in English as is documented in most
books on language instruction. Italian morphol-
ogy is well defi ned, and thus we used such ma-
terials to ensure that morphologic coverage was
complete and could be performed rapidly. Another
quick change that could be made was to replace
all lexicalized closed-class words in the grammar
(such as the English&amp;quot; to&apos;ivith infi nities).
Next, we performed basic testing of examples
in the provided SURGE test suite (with Italian lex-
icalizations substituted and additional features like
gender added) to gauge how many changes might
be necessary. The results showed that morphology
interactions and linear precedence were the most
obvious errors that were immediately noticeable.
We thus proceeded to attempt to fi xthese errors
before concentrating on the grammar itself. After
reexamining the newly regenerated sentences, we
found that most were recognizably similar to the
Italian equivalent &amp;quot; goldstandards&amp;quot;, even if they
contained many errors.
We next controlled for morphological interac-
tions between adjacent words (similar to contrac-
tions in English), adjust for accented characters
not present in English, and add simple feature
propagations such as gender in predicate verb and
attributive noun constructions where similar such
features (e.g. number) already existed. Finally, we
began work on the more diffi cultdifferences in ac-
tual grammar, which required signifi cantly more
time than the changes mentioned above.
At this point there are two possible directions
that a surface realization project can take: to
continually develop the grammar as a linguistic-

5 Quantitative Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901272727272">
The overall process required approximately five
person-months, split between two people: one
with pre-existing knowledge of FuF/SuRGE and
a native English speaker, the other without knowl-
edge of FuF/S URGE who is a native speaker of
Italian. By the middle of the project, the second
person was capable of making major grammatical
changes unaided. Also, as the project continued
and intensive knowledge of Italian was increas-
ingly necessary, the burden of the labor shifted
to the native Italian speaker. Below we detail the
information gathered after this five month period,
when the surface realizer was suffi ciently devel-
oped to produce a paragraph of Italian in a work-
ing demo where the equivalent English paragraph
was also generated from the same discourse plan.
Table 1 shows various quantitative aspects of
the grammar-creation process. Lines refers to the
number of lines of actual code devoted to different
items. While not indicative of the amount or de-
gree of changes necessary, the results show a high
degree of correlation between the overall sizes.

This indicates that even when substantial changes
were made, they effect was to replace rather than
increase or decrease the size of the grammar.
A more closely related statistic is the number
of actual constraints incorporated in the gram-
mar. Due to the feature-based nature of the func-
tional unifi cationformalism (Kay, 1979) underly-
ing SURGE, it is possible to count the number of
times features are expressed. This ignores the ef-
fects that comments and formatting imposed by
different grammar authors have on the grammar
itself as a data structure.
Work time refl ects the percentage of the five
person months that were spent in certain areas of
the grammar and other resources. Small percent-
ages indicate that a grammar module was little
changed from the previous grammar. Unlike the
other statistics, this is an estimate, as we did not
count the actual time spent in each area. Impor-
tantly, it is probably not possible to make a com-
pletely accurate estimate of time spent, as different
people work at different speeds, and even a sin-
gle person will work slowly or quickly on different
days.
This data indicates that noun/determiner
phrases and morphology required the most
amount of work. We hypothesize that this data
also indicates the verbal systems between English
and Italian are closer than the nominal systems?&apos;
To ensure the robustness and to double check
the coverage, we employed the grammar as part
of several multilingual projects we are currently
researching. Thus the size of the regression test
set is rather small compared to that of the English
version, especially as we did not fi ndexamples of
questions, appositions, partitives, dates, forms of
address, etc. that are contained in the original re-
gression set. From this work we estimate that an-
other five to six person months would be neces-
sary to ensure that these additional types of possi-

pare with that for template generation
It is highly desirable that multilingual gener-
ation can take place with a minimal amount of
changes to architectural modules. Because the
functional unifi cationformalism is feature-based,
features are a necessary aspect of the representa-
tion. But it is an open research topic whether dif-
ferent languages can be described with a similar
set of semantic features (c.f research on interlin-
guas) and if so, can such a representation generate
a large enough set of paraphrases in each target
language. Another way of looking at this is to ask
whether the divergent structures in Figure 2 can
be resolved so that they are identical but generate
the different required syntax. If not, this problem
must be pushed further up the NLG pipeline. In
the texts we have generated, we have yet to fi nd
an example where changes above the level of the
sentence planner must be made. In practice, most
syntactic features which are not part of both lan-
guages (such as the dative-shift feature in SURGE)
have been safely ignored because they are not ref-
erenced or constrained in the Italian grammar.
A second aspect is the use of regression test-
ing with a small number of examples to &amp;quot; test&apos;the
coverage of the grammar. Without standards, re-
gression testing is useless as a comparison met-
ric between surface realizers because (1) it is not
clear how many examples are necessary, (2) there
is no recognized set of levels of coverage other
than &amp;quot; notomplete&amp;quot;, and (3) it is not clear how
complex a set of examples needs to be (e.g., does
every possible combination of intermixed features
or syntactic constructions need to be attempted).
Finally, it is important to be able to compare
with a cost/benefi (analysis the claimed advantages
of lingustic-based (deep) generation over those of
• What other NLG infrastructure was there to
begin with? The Italian grammar we devel-
oped was used in a separate project which al-
ready had extensive NLG infrastructure. For
both template and deep generation systems,
most of the development effort goes into pro-
ducing a working system for a single lan-
guage. But it is unknown what the costs of
additional languages are for each approach.
• How domain-independent is each approach?
Intuitively, template approaches are highly
domain-specifi c while deep generation is
more domain independent. But to what ex-
tent has never been quantitatively demon-
strated.

of effort on the grammar result in a domain-

but detailed evidence must be collected on
a template realizer and deep generation real-
izer working with an identical NLG pipelined
system on an identical project and domain to

<bodyText confidence="0.999796444444444">
Multilingual generation is an increasingly impor-
tant tool to demonstrate the widely-believed but
little-substantiated intuition that natural language
generation can provide effective and effi cientsys-
terns whose development costs outweigh those of
other methodologies such as template generation.
But there has been little published evidence on
what these costs may be, without which it is im-
possible to make an educated comparison.

ysis of the effort required to build a grammar
by reusing existing resources, a summary of the
changes required, and estimates of how much
work was devoted to varying aspects. This type
of data is a necessary precursor to making future
comparisons between differing methodologies on
the basis of system development cost rather than
traditional approaches which evaluate the text pro-
duced in a working system.
Finally, the material result of this project has
been a functioning Italian generation grammar,
which we plan to make available to the NLG com-
munity as an open source, freely available com-
mon resource.

Most such systems require multiple grammars, one for each language which must be deployed. Yet little is known about the development costs for additional languages which are developed not from scratch, but by adapting existing resources.

One of the most important of these resources is the grammar that a surface realizer uses to produce linearized text from a syntactic sentence plan, and multilingual systems must use a distinct grammar for each desired language.

In order to make an informed comparison, hard data is needed on the costs for developing and maintaining projects which use both formalisms. In this article, we provide such data for the grammar and morphology development of an Italian surface realizer as a fi rst step in allowing such comparisons to be made. During the course of work on a multilingual generation system for English and Italian, we took elements from both the original FuF/SuRGE 71 systemic-functional surface realizer for English (Elhadad, 1991; Elhadad, 1992; Robin, 1994) as well as a less-developed Spanish version (Callaway et al., 1999) of that same realizer to create a new Italian versionl . The porting process involved changes to morphology, linearization, and the grammar, while leaving unchanged other features of the FUF system such as formatting and effi cienT directives. This paper presents the results of creating the new surface realizer, including an overview of differences between the languages and a quantitative analysis of the effort and changes involved. 2 Examples of Language Differences The differences between Italian and English are not signifi cantcompared to languages from differing families.

A more closely related statistic is the number of actual constraints incorporated in the grammar. Due to the feature-based nature of the functional unifi cationformalism (Kay, 1979) underlying SURGE, it is possible to count the number of times features are expressed. This ignores the effects that comments and formatting imposed by different grammar authors have on the grammar itself as a data structure. Work time refl ects the percentage of the five person months that were spent in certain areas of the grammar and other resources. Small percentages indicate that a grammar module was little changed from the previous grammar.

The following areas are indicative of the types of linguistic changes necessary when generating Italian text as opposed to English. Extensive catalogues of such changes for other languages such as French also exist (Rayner et al., 1996). The various categories for Italian include: Morphology Changes that affect the prefi es and suffi s of words for purposes of agreement, along with interactions between surface forms after they have already been syntactically specifi ed. • Irregular Words: Irregulars mainly concern lexical forms for nouns, verbs, and adjectives (which have few irregular forms in either English or Italian). Besides the three most important, regular rules for Italian noun pluralization (-o/-i, -a/-e, -e/-i), there are more than 20 other minor rules for pluralization (e.g., nouns with accented endings: sing. cri</context>

The porting process involved changes to morphology, linearization, and the grammar, while leaving unchanged other features of the FUF system such as formatting and effi cienT directives. This paper presents the results of creating the new surface realizer, including an overview of differences between the languages and a quantitative analysis of the effort and changes involved. 2 Examples of Language Differences The differences between Italian and English are not signifi</context>

These systems require an array of resources that can function regardless of the language selected, such as discourse and sentence planning rules, lexica, and pronominalization strategies. One of the most important of these resources is the grammar that a surface realizer uses to produce linearized text from a syntactic sentence plan, and multilingual systems must use a distinct grammar for each desired language. While many multilingual systems have either developed grammars from scratch or borrowed them from other projects, relatively few projects have focused on reworking existing grammars </context>
