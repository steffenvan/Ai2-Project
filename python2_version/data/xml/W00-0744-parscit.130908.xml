<bodyText confidence="0.994404705882353">
In Czech corpora compound verb groups are
usually tagged in word-by-word manner. As a
consequence, some of the morphological tags of
particular components of the verb group lose
their original meaning. We present a method for
automatic recognition of compound verb groups
in Czech. From an annotated corpus 126 def-
inite clause grammar rules were constructed.
These rules describe all compound verb groups
that are frequent in Czech. Using those rules
we can find compound verb groups in unanno-
tated texts with the accuracy 93%. Tagging
compound verb groups in an annotated corpus
exploiting the verb rules is described.

1 Compound Verb Groups
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995802145454546">
Recognition and analysis of the predicate in a
sentence is fundamental for the meaning of the
sentence and its further analysis. In more than
half of Czech sentences the predicate contains
the compound verb group. E.g. in the sentence
Mrzi me, e jsem o te konferenci nevedela, byla
bych se ji rdeastnila. (literary translation: I am
sorry that I did not know about the conference,
I would have participated in it.) there are three
verb groups
&lt;vg&gt; Mrzi &lt;/vg&gt; me, e &lt;vg&gt; jsem o te kon-
ferenci neve&apos;dela &lt;/vg&gt;, &lt;vg&gt; byla bych se ji
zaeastnila. &lt;/vg&gt;
/ &lt;vg&gt; am sorry &lt;/vg&gt; that I &lt;vg&gt; did
not know &lt;/vg&gt; about the conference, I &lt;vg&gt;
would have participated &lt;/vg&gt; in it.
Verb groups are often split into more parts with
so called gap words. In the second verb group
the gap words are o te konferenci (about the
conference). In annotated Czech corpora, in-
cluding DESAM (Pala et al., 1997), compound
verb groups are usually tagged in word-by-word
manner. As a consequence, some of the morpho-
logical tags of particular components of the verb
group loose their original meaning. It means
that the tags are correct for a single word but
they do not reflect the meaning of the words in
context. In the above sentence the word jsem
is tagged as a verb in present tense, but the
whole verb group to which it belongs — jsem
nevedela — is in past tense. Similar situation ap-
pears in byla bych se ji zlieastnila (I would have
participated in it) where zita&apos;astnila is tagged as
past tense while it is only a part of past condi-
tional. Without finding all parts of a compound
verb group and without tagging the whole group
(what is necessary dependent on other parts of
the compound verb group) it is impossible to
continue with any kind of semantic analysis.
We consider a compound verb group to be a
list of verbs and maybe the reflexive pronouns
se, si. Such a group is obviously compound of
auxiliary and full-meaning verbs, e.g. budu se
umgvat where budu is auxiliary verb (like will in
English), se is the reflexive pronoun and umgvat
means to wash. As word-by-word tagging of
verb groups is confusing, it is useful to find and
assign a new tag to the whole group. This tag
should contain information about the beginning
and the end of the group and about the particu-
lar components of the verb group. It must also
contain information about relevant grammati-
cal categories that characterise the verb group
as a whole. In (Zakkova and Pala, 1999), a pro-
posal of the method for automatic finding of

compound verb groups in the corpus DESAM
is introduced. We describe here the improved
method that results in definite clause grammar
rules - called verb rules - that contain informa-
tion about all components of a particular verb
group and about tags. We describe also some
improvements that allow us to increase the ac-
curacy of verb group recognition.
The paper is organised as follows. Corpus DE-
SAM is described in Section 2. Section 3 con-
tains a description of the method for learning
verb rules. Recognition of verb groups in anno-
tated text is discussed in Section 4. Improve-
ments of this method are introduced in Sec-
tion 5. In Section 6 we briefly show how the
tag for the compound verb group is constructed
employing verb rules. We conclude with dis-
cussion (Section 7), the description of ongoing
research (Section 8) and with a summary of rel-
evant works (Section 9).

2 Data Source
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999498944444444">
DESAM (Pala et al., 1997), the annotated and
fully disambiguated corpus of Czech newspaper
texts, has been used as the source of learning
data. It contains more than 1 000 000 word
positions, about 130 000 different word forms,
about 65 000 of them occurring more then once,
and 1 665 different tags. E.g. in Tab. 1 the tag
k5eApFnStMmPaP of the word mieastnila (partic-
ipated) means: part of speech (k) = verb (5),
person (p) = feminine (F), number (n) = sin-
gular (S) and tense (t) = past (M). Lemmata
and possible tags are prefixed by &lt;1&gt;, &lt;t&gt; re-
spectively. As pointed out in (Pala et al., 1997;
PopelinskST et al., 1999), DESAM is not large
enough. It does not contain the representative
set of Czech sentences yet. In addition some
words are tagged incorrectly and about 1/5 po-
sitions are untagged.

The algorithm for learning verb rules (266kova,
and Pala, 1999) takes as its input annotated
sentences from corpus DESAM. The algorithm
is split into three steps: finding verb chunks
(i.e. finding boundaries of simple clauses in
compound or in complex sentences, and elim-
ination of gap words), generalisation and verb
rule synthesis. These three steps are described
below.

<bodyText confidence="0.99918975">
The observed properties of a verb group are the
following: their components are either verbs or
a reflexive pronoun se (si); the boundary of a
verb group cannot be crossed by the boundary
of a sentence; and between two components of
the verb group there can be a gap consisting of
an arbitrary number of non-verb words or even a
whole sentence. In the first step, the boundaries
of all sentences are found. Then each gap is
replaced by tag gap.
The method exploits only the lemma of each
word (nominative singular for nouns, adjectives,
pronouns and numerals, infinitive for verbs) and
its tag. We will demonstrate the whole process
using the third simplex sentence of the clause in

mata of modal verbs and verbs with similar be-
haviour are replaced by tag modal. These verbs

verb valencies (Pala and Seve6ek P., 1999). In
our example it is the verb rdeastnit that is re-
moved.

3.2.2 Generalisation of grammatical
categories
Exploiting linguistic knowledge, several gram-
matical categories are not important for verb
group description. Very often it is negation (e),
or aspect (a - a stands for imperfectum, aP
for perfectum). These categories may be re-
moved. For some of verbs even person (p) can
be removed. In our example the values of those
grammatical categories have been replaced by?
and we obtained

Another situation appears when two or more
values of some category are related. In the sim-
plest case they have to be the same — e.g. the
value of attribute person (p) in the first and the
last word of our example. More complicated is
the relation among the values of attribute num-
ber (n). They should be the same except when
the polite way of addressing occurs, e.g. in byl
byste se :if vidastnil (you would have partici-
pated in it). Thus we have to check whether the
values are the same or the conditions of polite
way of addressing are satisfied. For this purpose
we add the predicate check_num() that ensures
agreement in the grammatical category number
and we obtain

be 0 represents auxiliary verb bat, cond() rep-
resents various forms of conditionals by, aby,

noun se (si), gap() is a special predicate for
manipulation with gaps, and k50 stands for ar-
bitrary non-auxiliary verb. The particular val-
ues of some arguments of non-terminals repre-
sent required properties. Simple cases of gram-
matical agreement are treated through binding
of variables. More complicated situations are
solved employing constraints like the predicate
check_num().

4 Recognition of Verb Groups
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975433333333">
The verb rules have been used for recognition,
and consequently for tagging, of verb groups in
unannotated text. A portion of sentences which
have not been used for learning, has been ex-
tracted from a corpus. Each sentence has been
ambiguously tagged with LEMMA morphologi-
cal analyser (Pala and Seve6ek, 1995), i.e. each
word of the sentence has been assigned to all
possible tags. Then all the verb rules were ap-
plied to each sentence. The learned verb rules
displayed quite good accuracy. For corpus DE-
SAM, a verb rule has been correctly assigned to
92.3% verb groups. We tested, too, how much
is this method dependent on the corpus that
was used for learning. As the source of testing
data we used Prague Tree Bank (PTB) Corpus
that is under construction at Charles Univer-
sity in Prague. The accuracy displayed was not
different from results for DESAM. It maybe ex-
plained by the fact that both corpora have been
built from newspaper articles.
Although the accuracy is acceptable for the test
data that include also clauses with just one
verb, errors have been observed for complex sen-
tences. In about 13% of them, some of com-
pound verb groups were not correctly recog-
nized. It was observed that almost 70% of these
errors were caused by incorrect lemma recogni-
tion. In the next section we describe a method
for fixing this kind of errors.

We combined two approaches, elimination of
lemmata which are very rare for a given
word form, and inductive logic program-
ming (Popelinsk57 et al., 1999; Pavelek and
PopelinsV, 1999). The method is used in the
post-processing phase to prune the set of rules

verb rules that recognised a word-lemma couple
of a very small frequency in the corpus. Actu-
ally those lemmata that did not appear more

be incorrect.
For testing, we randomly chose the set of 600

tences from corpus DESAM. 251 sentences con-

5.2 Lemma disambiguation by ILP
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97903345">
Some of incorrectly recognised lemmata cannot
be fixed by the method described. E.g. word
form se has two lemmata, se— reflexive pronoun
and s — preposition with and both word-lemma
couples are very frequent in Czech. For such
cases we exploited inductive logic programming
(ILP). The program reads the context of the
lemma-ambiguous word and results in disam-
biguation rules (PopelinsV et al., 1999; Pavelek
and Popelins14, 1999). We employed ILP sys-
tem Alephl.
Domain knowledge predicates (PopelinskST et
al., 1999; Pavelek and Popelins14, 1999) have
the form p (Context , f irst (N) , Condit ion)
or p (Context ,somewhere , Condit ion) . where
Context contains tags of either left or right
context (for the left context in the re-
verse order), first (N) defines a subset of
Context, somewhere does not narrow the con-
text. The term Condition can have three
forms, somewhere (List) (the values in List
appeared somewhere in the define subset of
Context), always (List) (the values appeared
in all tags in the given subset of Context) and
n_times (N ,Tag) (Tag may appear n-times in the
specified context). E.g. p (Lef t , f irst (2) ,
always ( [k5 , ) ) succeeds if in the first two
tags of the left context there always appears
k5 , eA.
In the last line of Tab. 2 and 3 there is the per-
centage of correct rules when also the lemma
disambiguation has been employed. The in-
crease of accuracy was much smaller than after
pruning rules that contain a rare lemma. It has
to be mentioned that in the case of PTB about a
half of errors (incorrectly recognised verb rules)
were caused by incorrect recognition of sentence
boundaries.

6 Tagging Verb Groups
</sectionHeader>

We now describe a method for compound verb
group tagging in morphologically annotated
corpora. We decided to use SGML-like notation
for tagging because it allows to incorporate
the new tags very easily into DESAM corpus.
The beginning and the end of the whole verb
group and beginnings and ends of its particular
components are marked. For the sentence byla
bych se ji vieastnila (I would have participated
in it) we receive
&lt;vg tag=&amp;quot;eApFatPmCaPrivOn

where &lt;vg&gt; &lt;/vg&gt; point out the beginning
and the end of the verb group, &lt;vgp&gt; &lt;/vgp&gt;
mark components (parts) of the verb group.
The assigned tag — i.e. values of significant
morphologic categories — of the whole group is
included as a value of attribute called tag in
the starting mark of the group. Value of the
attribute fmverb is the full-meaning verb; this
information can be exploited e.g. for searching
and processing of verb valencies afterwards.
The value of attribute tag is computed auto-
matically from the verb rule that describes the
compound verb group.
We are also able to detect other properties of
compound verb groups. In the example above
the new category r is introduced. It indicates
that the group is reflexive (r1.) or not (r0).
The category v enables to mark whether the
group is in the form of polite way of addressing
(v1) or not (v0). The differences of the tag
values can be observed comparing the previous
and the following examples (nebyl byste se ji
zueastnil (you would not have participated in
it))
&lt;vg tag=&amp;quot;eNpMnStPmCaPr1v1&amp;quot;

pound verb group type. It will enable to find
the groups of the same type but with different
word order or the number of components.

7 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942083333333">
Sometimes compound verb groups are defined in
a less general way. Another approach that deal
with the recognition and morphological tagging
of compound verb groups in Czech appeared in
(Osolsobe, 1999). Basic compound verb groups
in Czech like active present, passive past tense,
present conditional etc., are defined in terms
of grammatical categories used in DESAM cor-
pus. Two drawbacks of this approach can be
observed. First, verb groups may only be com-
pound of a reflexive pronoun, verbs to be and
not more than one full-meaning verb. Second,
the gap between two words of the particular
group cannot be longer than three words. The
verb rules defined here are less general then the
basic verb groups (Osolsobe, 1999). Actually
verb rules make partition of them. Thus we can
tag all these basic verb groups without the lim-
itations mentioned above. In contrast to some
other approaches we include into the groups also
some verbs which are in fact infinitive partici-
pants of verb valencies. However, we are able to
detect such cases and recognize the &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; verb
groups afterwards. We believe that for some
kind of shallow semantic analysis — e.g. in di-
alogue systems — our approach is more conve-
nient.
We are also able to recognize the form of po-
lite way of addressing a person (which has not
equivalent in English, but similar phenomenon
appears e.g. in French or German). We extend
the tag of a verb group with this information.
because it is quite important for understanding
the sentence. E.g. in äel jste (vous etes all0 the
word jste (etes) should be counted as singular
although it is always tagged as plural.

8 Ongoing Research

<bodyText confidence="0.999935509433963">
Our work is a part of the project which aims
at building a partial parser for Czech. Main
idea of partial parsing (Abney, 1991) is to rec-
ognize those parts of sentences which can be re-
covered reliably and with a small amount of syn-
tactic information. In this paper we deal with
recognition and tagging potentially discontinu-
ous verb chunks. The problem of recognition of
noun chunks in Czech was addressed in (SmfZ&amp;quot;
and Zaekova, 1998). We aim at an advanced
method that should employ a minimum of ad
hoc techniques and should be, ideally, fully au-
tomatic. The first step in this direction, the
method for pruning verb rules, has been de-
scribed in this paper. In the future we want
to make the method even more adaptive. Some
preliminary results on finding sentence bound-
ary are displayed below.
In Czech it is either comma and/or a conjunc-
tion that make the boundary between two sen-
tences. From the corpus we have randomly cho-
sen 406 pieces of text that contain a comma.
In 294 cases the comma split two sentences. All
&amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; cases (when comma is followed by a con-
junction, it must be a boundary) were removed.
It was 155 out of 294 cases. 80% of the rest of
examples was used for learning. We used again
Aleph for learning. For the test set the learned
rules correctly recognised comma as a delimiter
of two sentences in 86.3% of cases. When the
&amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; cases were added the accuracy increased
to 90.8%.
Then we tried to employ this method for auto-
matic finding of boundaries in our system for
verb group recognition. Decrease of accuracy
was expected but it was quite small. In spite of
some extra boundary was found (the particular
comma did not split two sentences), the correct
verb groups have been found in most of such
cases. The reason is that such incorrectly de-
tected boundary splits a compound verb group
very rarely.
The last experiment concerned the case when
a conjunction splits two sentences and the con-
junction is not preceded with comma. There
are four such conjunctions in Czech — a (and),
nebo (or), i (even) and ani (neither, nor). Us-
ing Aleph we obtained the accuracy on test data
88.3% for a (500 examples, 90% used /for learn-
ing) and 87.2% for nebo (110 examples). The
last two conjunctions split sentences very rarely.
Actually, in the current version of corpus DE-
SAM it has never happened.

Another approach for recognition of compound
verb groups in Czech (Osolsobe, 1999) have
been already discussed in Section 7. Ramshaw
and Marcus (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) views
chunking as a tagging problem. They used
transformation-based learning and achieved re-
call and precision rates 93% for base noun
phrase (non-recursive noun phrase) and 88% for
chunks that partition the sentence. Verb chunk-
ing for English was solved by Veenstra (Veen-
stra, 1999). He used memory-based learner
Timbl for noun phrase, verb phrase and propo-
sitional phrase chunking.Each word in a sen-
tence was first assigned one of tags LT (inside
the phrase), O_T (outside the phrase) and B_T
(left-most word in the phrase that is preceded
by another phrase of the same kind), where T
stands for the kind of a phrase.
Chunking in Czech language is more difficult
than in English for two reasons. First, a gap
inside a verb group may be more complex and
it may be even a whole sentence. Second, Czech
language is a free word-order language what im-
plies that the process of recognition of the verb
group structure is much more difficult.

In more than half of Czech sentences the predicate contains the compound verb group. E.g. in the sentence Mrzi me, e jsem o te konferenci nevedela, byla se ji rdeastnila. translation: am sorry that I did not know about the conference, would have participated in it.) are three verb groups e o te konneve&apos;dela &lt;vg&gt; bych se ji &lt;vg&gt; sorry I know the conference, I have participated in Verb groups are often split into more parts with so called gap words. In the second verb group gap words are te konferenci (about the annotated Czech corpora, including DESAM (Pala et al., 1997), compound verb groups are usually tagged in word-by-word manner. As a consequence, some of the morphological tags of particular components of the verb group loose their original meaning. It means that the tags are correct for a single word but they do not reflect the meaning of the words in In the above sentence the word is tagged as a verb in present tense, but the verb group to which it belongs — — in past tense. Similar situation apin bych se ji zlieastnila (I would have in it) tagged as past tense while it is only a part of past conditional. Without finding all parts of a compound verb group and without tagging the whole group (what is necessary dependent on other parts of the compound verb group) it is impossible to continue with any kind of semantic analysis. We consider a compound verb group to be a list of verbs and maybe the reflexive pronouns si. a group is obviously compound of and full-meaning verbs, e.g. se auxiliary verb (like the reflexive pronoun and wash. word-by-word tagging of verb groups is confusing, it is useful to find and assign a new tag to the whole group. This tag should contain information about the beginning and the end of the group and about the particular components of the verb group. It must also contain information about relevant grammatical categories that characterise the verb group as a whole. In (Zakkova and Pala, 1999), a proposal of the method for automatic finding of 219 Mrzi me ze jsem te konferenci nevedela byla bych se • &apos; Ji theastnila compound verb groups in the corpus DESAM is introduced. We describe here the improved method that results in definite clause grammar rules called verb rules that contain information about all components of a particular verb group and about tags. We describe also some improvements that allow us to increase the accuracy of verb group recognition. The paper is organised as follows. Corpus DE- SAM is described in Section 2. Section 3 contains a description of the method for learning verb rules. Recognition of verb groups in annotated text is discussed in Section 4. Improvements of this method are introduced in Section 5. In Section 6 we briefly show how the tag for the compound verb group is constructed employing verb rules. We conclude with discussion (Section 7), the description of ongoing research (Section 8) and with a summary of relevant works (Section 9). 2 Data Source DESAM (Pala et al., 1997), the annotated and fully disambiguated corpus of Czech newspaper texts, has been used as the source of learning data. It contains more than 1 000 000 word positions, about 130 000 different word forms, about 65 000 of them occurring more then once, and 1 665 different tags. E.g. in Tab. 1 the tag the (particpart of speech (k) = verb (5), person (p) = feminine (F), number (n) = singular (S) and tense (t) = past (M). Lemmata possible tags are prefixed by &lt;1&gt;, respectively. As pointed out in (Pala et al., 1997; PopelinskST et al., 1999), DESAM is not large enough. It does not contain the representative set of Czech sentences yet. In addition some words are tagged incorrectly and about 1/5 positions are untagged. 3 Learning Verb Rules The algorithm for learning verb rules (266kova, and Pala, 1999) takes as its input annotated sentences from corpus DESAM. The algorithm is split into three steps: finding verb chunks (i.e. finding boundaries of simple clauses in compound or in complex sentences, and elimination of gap words), generalisation and verb rule synthesis. These three steps are described below.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.978853114606742">sentence 3.1 Verb Chunks The observed properties of a verb group are the following: their components are either verbs or reflexive pronoun (si); boundary of a verb group cannot be crossed by the boundary of a sentence; and between two components of the verb group there can be a gap consisting of an arbitrary number of non-verb words or even a whole sentence. In the first step, the boundaries of all sentences are found. Then each gap is by tag The method exploits only the lemma of each word (nominative singular for nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals, infinitive for verbs) and its tag. We will demonstrate the whole process using the third simplex sentence of the clause in 1 bych se ji mieastnila (I would have 220 participated in it)): b9t/k5eApFnStMmPaI by/k5eApinStPmCaI se/k3xXnSc3 on/k3xPgUnSc4p3 miCastnit/k5eApFnStMmPaP After substitution of gaps we obtain byt/k5eApFnStMinPaI by/k5eApinStPmCaI si/k3xXnSc3 gap ziiCastnit/k5eApFnStMmPaP The lemmata and the tags are now being generalised. Three generalisation operations are employed: elimination of (some of) lemmata, generalisation of grammatical categories and finding grammatical agreement constraints. Elimination of lemmata except forms of auxiliary verb be) by, aby, kdyby) are rejected. Lemmata of modal verbs and verbs with similar beare replaced by tag verbs have been found in the list of more than 15 000 verb valencies (Pala and Seve6ek P., 1999). In example it is the verb is removed. byt/k5eApFnStMmPaI by/k5eApinStPmCaI k3xXnSc3 gap k5eApFnStMmPaP 3.2.2 Generalisation of grammatical categories Exploiting linguistic knowledge, several grammatical categories are not important for verb group description. Very often it is negation (e), aspect (a for imperfectum, aP for perfectum). These categories may be removed. For some of verbs even person (p) can be removed. In our example the values of those grammatical categories have been replaced by? and we obtained byt/k5e?pFnStMmPa? by/k5e?p?nStPmCa? k3xXnSc? gap k5e?pFnStMmPa? 3.2.3 Finding grammatical agreement constraints Another situation appears when two or more values of some category are related. In the simplest case they have to be the same — e.g. the value of attribute person (p) in the first and the last word of our example. More complicated is the relation among the values of attribute number (n). They should be the same except when polite way of addressing occurs, e.g. in byste se :if vidastnil (you would have particiin it). we have to check whether the values are the same or the conditions of polite way of addressing are satisfied. For this purpose add the predicate ensures agreement in the grammatical category number and we obtain byt/k5e?p_n_tMmPa? by/k5e?p?n_tPmCa? k3xXnSc? gap k5e?p_n_tMmPa? check_num(n) 3.3 DCG Rules Synthesis Finally the verb rule is constructed by rewriting the result of the generalisation phase. For the bych se ji mieastnila have in it) obtain verb_group(vg(Be,Cond,Se,Verb), Gaps) --&gt; be(Be,_,P,N,tMouP,_), % byt/k5e?p_n_tMmPa? cond(Cond,_,_,Ncond,tP,mC,_), by/k5e?p?n_tPmCa? {check_num(N,Ncond,Cond,Vy)}, reflex_pron(Se,xX,_,_) , % k3xXnSc? gap( ,Gaps) , % gap k5(Verb,_,_,P,N,tM,mP,_) % k5e?p_n_tMmPa? If this rule does not exist in the set of verb is added into it. The meanings of non-terminals used in the rule are following: 221 represents auxiliary verb represents various forms of conditionals by, aby, for reflexive pro- (si), a special predicate for with gaps, and for arbitrary non-auxiliary verb. The particular values of some arguments of non-terminals represent required properties. Simple cases of grammatical agreement are treated through binding of variables. More complicated situations are solved employing constraints like the predicate check_num(). The method has been implemented in Perl. 126 definite clause grammar rules were constructed from the annotated corpus that describe all verb groups that are frequent in Czech. 4 Recognition of Verb Groups The verb rules have been used for recognition, and consequently for tagging, of verb groups in unannotated text. A portion of sentences which have not been used for learning, has been extracted from a corpus. Each sentence has been ambiguously tagged with LEMMA morphological analyser (Pala and Seve6ek, 1995), i.e. each word of the sentence has been assigned to all possible tags. Then all the verb rules were applied to each sentence. The learned verb rules displayed quite good accuracy. For corpus DE- SAM, a verb rule has been correctly assigned to 92.3% verb groups. We tested, too, how much is this method dependent on the corpus that was used for learning. As the source of testing data we used Prague Tree Bank (PTB) Corpus that is under construction at Charles University in Prague. The accuracy displayed was not different from results for DESAM. It maybe explained by the fact that both corpora have been built from newspaper articles. Although the accuracy is acceptable for the test data that include also clauses with just one verb, errors have been observed for complex sentences. In about 13% of them, some of compound verb groups were not correctly recognized. It was observed that almost 70% of these errors were caused by incorrect lemma recognition. In the next section we describe a method for fixing this kind of errors. 5 Fixing Misclassification Errors We combined two approaches, elimination of lemmata which are very rare for a given word form, and inductive logic program- (Popelinsk57 et al., and PopelinsV, 1999). The method is used in the post-processing phase to prune the set of rules that have fired for the sentence. 5.1 Elimination of infrequent lemmata In Czech corpora it was observed that 10% of word positions — i.e. each 10th word of a text — have at least 2 lemmata and about 1% word forms of Czech vocabulary has at least 2 lemmata. (PopelinsI4 et al., 1999; Pavelek and 1999) E.g. word form be Table 2: DESAM: Results for unannotated text Table 3: PTB: Results for unannotated text preposition the lesson) imof decided to remove all the verb rules that recognised a word-lemma couple of a very small frequency in the corpus. Actually those lemmata that did not appear more than twice in DESAM corpus were supposed to be incorrect. For testing, we randomly chose the set of 600 examples including compound or complex sentences from corpus DESAM. 251 sentences contained only one verb. The results obtained are in Tab. 2. The first line contains the number of examples used. In the following line there are results of the original method as mentioned in Section 4. Next line (+ infrequent lemmata) number of examples original method + infrequent lemmata + ILP correct rules(%) &gt; 1 verb all 349 600 86.8 92.3 91.1 94.8 92.8 95.8 number of examples original method + infrequent lemmata + ILP correct rules(%) &gt; 1 verb all 284 467 87.0 92.1 91.6 94.9 92.6 95.5 222 displays results when the word-lemma couple of a very small frequency have been removed. The column &apos;&gt; 1 verb&apos; concerns the sentences where at least two verbs appeared. The column &apos;all&apos; displays accuracy for all sentences. Results for corpus PTB are displayed in Tab. 3. It can be observed that after pruning rules that contain a rare lemma the accuracy significantly increased. Lemma disambiguation by Some of incorrectly recognised lemmata cannot be fixed by the method described. E.g. word two lemmata, pronoun — both word-lemma couples are very frequent in Czech. For such cases we exploited inductive logic programming (ILP). The program reads the context of the lemma-ambiguous word and results in disambiguation rules (PopelinsV et al., 1999; Pavelek and Popelins14, 1999). We employed ILP system Alephl. Domain knowledge predicates (PopelinskST et al., 1999; Pavelek and Popelins14, 1999) have form (Context , f irst (N) , Condit ion) (Context ,somewhere , Condit ion) . tags of either left or right context (for the left context in the reorder), (N) a subset of somewhere not narrow the con- The term have three (List) values in appeared somewhere in the define subset of always (List) values appeared all tags in the given subset of (N ,Tag) (Tag appear n-times in the context). E.g. (Lef t , f irst (2) , ( [k5 , ) ) if in the first tags of the left context there always appears k5 , eA. last line of Tab. 2 and 3 there is the percentage of correct rules when also the lemma disambiguation has been employed. The increase of accuracy was much smaller than after pruning rules that contain a rare lemma. It has be mentioned that in the case of a half of errors (incorrectly recognised verb rules) were caused by incorrect recognition of sentence boundaries. machlearn/Aleph/aleph.html 6 Tagging Verb Groups We now describe a method for compound verb group tagging in morphologically annotated corpora. We decided to use SGML-like notation for tagging because it allows to incorporate the new tags very easily into DESAM corpus. The beginning and the end of the whole verb group and beginnings and ends of its particular are marked. For the sentence bych se ji vieastnila (I would have participated it) receive &lt;vg tag=&amp;quot;eApFatPmCaPrivOn fmverb=&amp;quot;zfiCastnitu&gt; &lt;vgp&gt;byla&lt;/vgp&gt; &lt;vgp&gt;bych&lt;/vgp&gt; &lt;vgp&gt;seqvgp&gt; 1 &lt;vgp&gt;zilCastnilaqvgp&gt; &lt;/vg&gt; &lt;/vg&gt; out the beginning the end of the verb group, &lt;/vgp&gt; mark components (parts) of the verb group. The assigned tag — i.e. values of significant morphologic categories — of the whole group is as a value of attribute called the starting mark of the group. Value of the the full-meaning verb; this information can be exploited e.g. for searching and processing of verb valencies afterwards. value of attribute computed automatically from the verb rule that describes the compound verb group. We are also able to detect other properties of compound verb groups. In the example above new category introduced. It indicates the group is reflexive not category to mark whether the group is in the form of polite way of addressing or not (v0). The differences of the values can be observed comparing the previous the following examples byste se ji zueastnil (you would not have participated in it)) &lt;vg tag=&amp;quot;eNpMnStPmCaPr1v1&amp;quot; fmverb=&amp;quot;zdeastnitu&gt; &lt;vgp&gt;nebyl&lt;/vgp&gt; &lt;vgp&gt;byste&lt;/vgp&gt; &lt;vgp&gt;se&lt;/vgp&gt; ji &lt;vgp&gt;zdeastnil&lt;/vgp&gt; &lt;/vg&gt; 223 The set of attributes can be also enriched e.g. with the number of components. We also plan to include into the attributes of &lt;vg&gt; compound verb group type. It will enable to find the groups of the same type but with different word order or the number of components. 7 Discussion Sometimes compound verb groups are defined in a less general way. Another approach that deal with the recognition and morphological tagging of compound verb groups in Czech appeared in (Osolsobe, 1999). Basic compound verb groups in Czech like active present, passive past tense, present conditional etc., are defined in terms of grammatical categories used in DESAM corpus. Two drawbacks of this approach can be observed. First, verb groups may only be comof a reflexive pronoun, verbs be not more than one full-meaning verb. Second, the gap between two words of the particular group cannot be longer than three words. The verb rules defined here are less general then the basic verb groups (Osolsobe, 1999). Actually verb rules make partition of them. Thus we can tag all these basic verb groups without the limitations mentioned above. In contrast to some other approaches we include into the groups also some verbs which are in fact infinitive participants of verb valencies. However, we are able to detect such cases and recognize the &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; verb groups afterwards. We believe that for some kind of shallow semantic analysis — e.g. in dialogue systems — our approach is more convenient. We are also able to recognize the form of polite way of addressing a person (which has not equivalent in English, but similar phenomenon appears e.g. in French or German). We extend the tag of a verb group with this information. because it is quite important for understanding sentence. E.g. in äel (vous etes all0 should be counted as singular although it is always tagged as plural. 8 Ongoing Research Our work is a part of the project which aims at building a partial parser for Czech. Main idea of partial parsing (Abney, 1991) is to recognize those parts of sentences which can be rereliably and with a small amount of syntactic information. In this paper we deal with recognition and tagging potentially discontinuous verb chunks. The problem of recognition of noun chunks in Czech was addressed in (SmfZ&amp;quot; and Zaekova, 1998). We aim at an advanced method that should employ a minimum of ad hoc techniques and should be, ideally, fully automatic. The first step in this direction, the method for pruning verb rules, has been described in this paper. In the future we want to make the method even more adaptive. Some preliminary results on finding sentence boundary are displayed below. In Czech it is either comma and/or a conjunction that make the boundary between two sentences. From the corpus we have randomly chosen 406 pieces of text that contain a comma. In 294 cases the comma split two sentences. All &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; cases (when comma is followed by a conjunction, it must be a boundary) were removed. It was 155 out of 294 cases. 80% of the rest of examples was used for learning. We used again Aleph for learning. For the test set the learned rules correctly recognised comma as a delimiter of two sentences in 86.3% of cases. When the &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; cases were added the accuracy increased to 90.8%. Then we tried to employ this method for automatic finding of boundaries in our system for verb group recognition. Decrease of accuracy was expected but it was quite small. In spite of some extra boundary was found (the particular comma did not split two sentences), the correct verb groups have been found in most of such cases. The reason is that such incorrectly detected boundary splits a compound verb group very rarely. The last experiment concerned the case when a conjunction splits two sentences and the conjunction is not preceded with comma. There four such conjunctions in Czech — a (or), i (even) ani nor). Using Aleph we obtained the accuracy on test data 88.3% for a (500 examples, 90% used /for learnand 87.2% for examples). The last two conjunctions split sentences very rarely. Actually, in the current version of corpus DE- SAM it has never happened. 224 9 Relevant works Another approach for recognition of compound verb groups in Czech (Osolsobe, 1999) have been already discussed in Section 7. Ramshaw and Marcus (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) views chunking as a tagging problem. They used transformation-based learning and achieved recall and precision rates 93% for base noun phrase (non-recursive noun phrase) and 88% for chunks that partition the sentence. Verb chunking for English was solved by Veenstra (Veenstra, 1999). He used memory-based learner Timbl for noun phrase, verb phrase and propositional phrase chunking.Each word in a senwas first assigned one of tags the phrase), O_T (outside the phrase) and B_T (left-most word in the phrase that is preceded by another phrase of the same kind), where T stands for the kind of a phrase. Chunking in Czech language is more difficult than in English for two reasons. First, a gap inside a verb group may be more complex and it may be even a whole sentence. Second, Czech language is a free word-order language what implies that the process of recognition of the verb group structure is much more difficult. 10 Conclusion We described the method for automatic recognition of compound verb groups in Czech sentences. Recognition of compound verb groups was tested on unannotated text randomly chosen from two different corpora and the accuracy reached 95% of correctly recognised verb groups. We also introduced the method for automatic tagging of compound verb groups. Acknowledgements We thank to anonymous referees for their comments. This research has been partially sup-</abstract>

We are also able to recognize the form of polite way of addressing a person (which has not equivalent in English, but similar phenomenon appears e.g. in French or German). We extend the tag of a verb group with this information. because it is quite important for understanding the sentence. E.g. in äel jste (vous etes all0 the word jste (etes) should be counted as singular although it is always tagged as plural. 8 Ongoing Research Our work is a part of the project which aims at building a partial parser for Czech. Main idea of partial parsing (Abney, 1991) is to recognize those parts of sentences which can be recovered reliably and with a small amount of syntactic information. In this paper we deal with recognition and tagging potentially discontinuous verb chunks. The problem of recognition of noun chunks in Czech was addressed in (SmfZ&amp;quot; and Zaekova, 1998). We aim at an advanced method that should employ a minimum of ad hoc techniques and should be, ideally, fully automatic. The first step in this direction, the method for pruning verb rules, has been described in this paper. In the future we want to make the method even more adaptive. Some pr</context>

We also plan to include into the attributes of &lt;vg&gt; compound verb group type. It will enable to find the groups of the same type but with different word order or the number of components. 7 Discussion Sometimes compound verb groups are defined in a less general way. Another approach that deal with the recognition and morphological tagging of compound verb groups in Czech appeared in (Osolsobe, 1999). Basic compound verb groups in Czech like active present, passive past tense, present conditional etc., are defined in terms of grammatical categories used in DESAM corpus. Two drawbacks of this approach can be observed. First, verb groups may only be compound of a reflexive pronoun, verbs to be and not more than one full-meaning verb. Second, the gap between two words of the particular group cannot be longer than three words. The verb rules defined here are less general then the basic verb groups (Osolsobe, 1999). Actually verb rules make partition of them. Thus we can tag all these basic ve</context>

The last experiment concerned the case when a conjunction splits two sentences and the conjunction is not preceded with comma. There are four such conjunctions in Czech — a (and), nebo (or), i (even) and ani (neither, nor). Using Aleph we obtained the accuracy on test data 88.3% for a (500 examples, 90% used /for learning) and 87.2% for nebo (110 examples). The last two conjunctions split sentences very rarely. Actually, in the current version of corpus DESAM it has never happened. 224 9 Relevant works Another approach for recognition of compound verb groups in Czech (Osolsobe, 1999) have been already discussed in Section 7. Ramshaw and Marcus (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) views chunking as a tagging problem. They used transformation-based learning and achieved recall and precision rates 93% for base noun phrase (non-recursive noun phrase) and 88% for chunks that partition the sentence. Verb chunking for English was solved by Veenstra (Veenstra, 1999). He used memory-based learner Timbl for noun phrase, verb phrase and propositional phrase chunking.Each word in a sentence was first assigned one of tags LT (inside the phrase), O_T (outside the phrase) and B_T (left-most word </context>
