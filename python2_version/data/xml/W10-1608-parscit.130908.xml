We present our work on the identification of opin-
ions and its components: the source, the topic and
the message. We describe a rule-based system for
which we achieved a recall of 74% and a precision
of 94%. Experimentation with machine-learning

<bodyText confidence="0.999131785714286">
For some tasks in language processing such as In-
formation Extraction or Q&amp;A Systems, it is im-
portant to know the opinions expressed by differ-
ent sources and their polarity, positive or negative,
with respect to different topics. There are even
commercial applications that provide this kind of
service (http://www.jodange.com).
We here present a system for identifying opin-
ions in Spanish texts. We define opinion as the re-
port of someone&apos;s statement about any subject ( El
investigador de la Politécnica afirma que el prin-
cipal problema de este sistema es conseguir que
sea fácil de usar / The researcher at the Politéc-
nica asserts that the main problem with this system

is making it easy to use), or as any mention of dis-
course participants’ beliefs (El PRI acepta parti-
cipar en el debate / The PRI agrees to participate
in the debate).
As a first step, we study the impact of elements
that typically introduce such expressions in written
text. These elements are mainly verbs of commu-
nication (decir, declarar / say, state) but other verb
classes (belief, agreement, appreciation) are also
considered. In other cases, the opinions will be ex-
pressed through nouns (opinión/opinion, declara-
ción/statement) or segments introduced by según
(according to) or similar expressions. To complete
the opinion, we identify its characteristic argu-
ments: the source, the topic and the message.
In addition to recognizing an opinion, we try to
determine its semantic orientation. To this end, we
consider certain subjective elements and operators
(reverse, intensifier, enhancing, neutralizing, etc.)
which affect them. In this article, we present only
results on the semantic orientation of opinion
verbs, opinion nouns and topic introducers
(sobre/about, con respecto a/with respect to, etc.).
There are many studies that address these is-
sues: Pang and Lee (2008), for instance, discuss in

detail various concepts in the area of &amp;quot;Opinion
Mining&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Sentiment Analysis&amp;quot; and present the
main proposals, resources and applications. For
our work, which focuses on the identification of
source, topic and message, we have mainly drawn
on the following: the scheme for annotating opin-
ions and emotions proposed by Wiebe, Wilson,
and Cardie (2005); the work on opinion-holder
(source) propositional opinion identification
presented in (Bethard et al., 2004); a system for
source identification using statistical methods
(Choi et al, 2005); a method for opinion-holder
and topic extraction from Kim and Hovy (2006);
the study on the identification of source and target
presented in (Ruppenhofer et al., 2008); and a
work on topic annotation (Stoyanov and Cardie,
2008).
For our semantic orientation study, we have
taken some concepts from Turney and Littman
(2003) and analyzed some work on subjectivity
operators (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004; Moilanen
and Pulman, 2007; Choi and Cardie, 2008).
In what follows, we briefly present the model
that has been defined to represent opinions and
two methods for their automatic recognition. First,
we describe a rule-based system that incorporates
lexical resources. This system, whose evaluation is
detailed below, achieves a recall of 74% and a pre-
cision of 97%. During the evaluation process we
produced an annotated corpus of 13,000 words, by
manually correcting the system output. The second
system, currently under development, involves the
application of machine-learning techniques to the
annotated corpus.

2 Opinion components
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996209875000001">
An opinion is composed of a predicative element
and its characteristic arguments. The set of opinion
predicates includes verbs, nouns and prepositions
(or prepositional locutions). Verbs belong to vari-
ous semantic classes: communication (decir / say,
declarar / state), assessment (criticar / criticize,
felicitar / compliment), belief (creer / believe,
opinar / think) and acceptance (aceptar / accept,
rechazar / reject).
These classes are similar to those proposed in
(Asher et al., 2008), the main difference being that
they include the class Sentiment but we do not.
Nouns are generally derived from the aforemen-
tioned verbs (opinión / opinion, declaración /
statement, apoyo / support). Some prepositions and
prepositional locutions are según, de acuerdo a,
para / according to.
The relevant arguments that we identified for the
opinion predicates are, as already mentioned,
source, topic and message. To establish this
scheme we analysed syntactico-semantic schemes
proposed in ADESSE2 for selected verb classes
(García-Miguel et al., 2005) and some of the Span-
ish FrameNet frames3 (Subirats-Rüggeberg and
Petruck., 2003), mainly the opinion frame whose
frame elements include cognizer (source), topic
and opinion (message) and the communication
frame for which some elements are communicator
(source), topic and message.
Our definition deviates from much of the literat-
ure on this subject because we limit our work to
opinions introduced by an opinion predicate, as ex-
plained above, while many of the cited works
identify all kinds of subjective expressions, mainly
adjectives with positive or negative polarity, as
with the expressive subjective elements described
in (Wiebe et al., 2005).
As in our work we focus on finding the source,
the message and the topic for each opinion, we ig-
nore all the text fragments in which there is no
evidence that the author is quoting or referring to
other participants’ opinions. These text fragments
constitute the message, as defined above, stated by
the text author. So, once our system has identified
other participants’ opinions, the remaining text
should be attributed to the text author.
Identifying subjective elements is necessary in
order to determine the semantic orientation of the
opinion. We think the treatment of these elements
within the author’s message is similar to the treat-
ment that must be applied within the message at-
tributed to any other source. Such a treatment is
not addressed in this work, since the semantic ori-
entation study presented here is restricted to opin-
ion predicates and topic introducers.
In some respects our work is related to that of
(Bethard et al., 2004). For opinions introduced by
opinion verbs, they identify the source (opinion
holder) and the message (propositional opinion),
restricting the study to messages that constitute
subordinate clauses. However, we seek also to
identify the explicit references to the topic and we
consider not only verbs but also some nouns and
prepositions such as según / according to. A fur-

<bodyText confidence="0.999588">
ther difference is that they distinguish propositions
containing an opinion from those transmitting facts
or predictions, whereas we do not make this dis-
tinction.
In our recognition of the topic we consider only
explicit references to the opinion subject. We look
for topic-introducing elements, such as sobre /
about, con respecto a / regarding, en contra de /
against, without trying to deduce the topic from
the study of the message itself.
For this general scheme, there are different in-
stances in which the arguments can take different
forms. Thus, for some opinion verbs such as re-
chazar / reject, the message is usually empty. For
other verbs the topic will be a noun phrase, such as
aceptar la propuesta / to accept the proposal,
while for others it will be a prepositional phrase,
for example, hablar de literatura / to speak about
literature.

2.1 Some opinion examples
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999584">
In a standard reported speech utterance (1), the
opinion predicate is a communication verb. The
source is the subject of the verb and the message is
contained in the subordinate clause. Normally,
there is not a segment expressing the topic.

3 The rule-based system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996577">
We developed a rule-based system for the identi-
fication of the opinion elements. The system takes
as input a pre-processed text using the POS-tagger
Freeling (Atserias et al., 2006) and Clatex (Won-
sever et al, 2006), a system that segments texts into
propositions. Several rule modules are then ap-
plied, introducing XML annotations showing the
identified opinions and their elements.
The following example illustrates the system
output:

higher prevalence than other viruses in these stud-
ies&lt;/message&gt;, &lt;predicate&gt;said&lt;/predicate&gt;
&lt;source&gt;Minister&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/opinion&gt;.
The rules are based on the contextual rules
formalism defined by Wonsever and Minel (2004),
including some further extensions. This type of
rule allows the specification of contexts, exclusion
zones, optionality, negation, and elimination of ex-
isting labels, among others. In addition, for each
rule it is possible to check various conditions on its
components, for example, membership in a list of
words. For applying the rules we used a system
implemented in Prolog.
The hand-written rules were derived from cor-
pus analysis. They are grouped into modules ac-
cording to the element they recognize: opinion pre-
dicate (verbs, nouns and prepositions), source, top-
ic and message. There is also a final module that
builds the entire opinion and some auxiliary mod-
ules: the complex noun phrase identifying module
(El director del Hospital Maciel, Daniel Parada /
The director of the Hospital Maciel, Daniel
Parada) and the subjective elements and operators
identifying module. Table 1 shows the number of
rules contained in each module. In the next section
we describe the source rules module.

These rules assign the source tag to text segments
that match the rule body (indicated by &lt;&gt; in the
table). The elements that precede the body and
those that follow it are the left and right contexts,
respectively. In addition to assigning the tag, the
rules assign values to some attributes:
- code of the rule that assigned the label
- syntactic structure (subject before verb / sub-
ject after verb / noun complement introduced by
de)
- semantic orientation value (-, +, 0)
The three rules fue1 identify sources that are the
subject of an opinion verb. We allow up to 3 words
between the subject and the verb; these words can-
not be verb, np, punctuation or conjunction (&lt;El
senador&gt; este martes dijo ... / &lt;the senator&gt; said
Tuesday ...). For rule fue1c we also allow a prepos-
itional phrase (prep + np) between the source and
the verb (..., dijo ayer a la prensa &lt;el
senador&gt; / ..., said yesterday to the reporters the
senator). As mentioned, we show simplified rules;
the actual rules include other restrictions such as
checking for subject-verb agreement.
Rule fue2 is applied when the opinion verb is in
participle form and the source is an agent comple-
ment (las palabras expresadas por el senador / the
words uttered by the senator).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996684">

<bodyText confidence="0.999817071428571">
The three rules fue3 concern noun phrases. The
source is usually introduced by de (las opiniones
del senador / the senator’s opinions) but it is also
common to find nouns in a support verb construc-
tion (el senador emitió una declaración / the sen-
ator issued a statement).
Finally, the five rules fue4 identify sources in-
troduced by según, para, de acuerdo a, de acuerdo
con, a juicio de / according to. When the source
introducer is según, we can find an opinion verb
between según and the source (según el senador /
según dijo el senador / according to the senator),
For the preposition para / for, preceding punctu-
ation is required because of its high ambiguity.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998793">
3.2 Lexical Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999891818181818">
Some of the rules, especially those for opinion pre-
dicate identification, rely heavily on lexical re-
sources: lists of opinion verbs and nouns, person
indicators (señor, doctor, senador / Mr., Dr., sen-
ator), institution indicators (institución, hospital,
diario / institution, hospital, journal), support
verbs (plantear, emitir / make, deliver), topic intro-
ducers (sobre, con respecto a / about, with respect
to), positive subjective elements (bueno, excelente,
diversión / good, excellent, fun), negative subject-
ive elements (malo, negativo, pesimista / bad, neg-
ative, pessimist), and operators (muy, extremada-
mente, a penas / very, extremely, just).
In particular, the list of opinion verbs and nouns
was manually created from corpora containing
Spanish texts: Corin (Grassi et al., 2001), Corpus
del Español (Davies, 2002) and a digital media
corpus created for this study. Only those verbs and
nouns that are frequently used in opinion contexts
were included in the list, so as to minimize ambi-
guity. At the time of evaluation, the list comprised
86 verbs and 42 nouns.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.469618">
3.2.1 The opinion verbs and nouns list
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98467175">
For each verb or noun, we register its lemma and
other information related to its syntactic and se-
mantic properties.
For verbs, we record the following information:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999922">
• semantic orientation [-, 0, +]
• semantic role of the subject [source, topic]
• prepositions that introduce the subject.
• subordinate clause admitted (message)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995738">
For example, for the verb decir / say, the cor-
responding values are (0, source, [ ], yes) for the
verb apoyar / support: (+, source, [a, np], no), for
the verb molestar / annoy: (-, topic, [ ], no).
For nouns, the information of interest is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.958967">
• semantic orientation [-, 0, +]
• semantic role of the complement intro-
duced by de [source, topic, ambiguous]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999882342857143">
For example, for the noun anuncio / announce-
ment, the corresponding values are (0, ambiguous).
Note that this noun is ambiguous because the com-
plement introduced by de can be either the source
(el anuncio del senador / the senator’s announce-
ment) or the topic (el anuncio de la extensión del
plazo / the announcement about the deadline ex-
tension). For the noun comentario / comment the
values are (0,source) and for apoyo / support the
values are (+, source).
The information associated to opinion predic-
ates is taken into account when applying the rules.
For example, the second attribute of the opinion
noun is checked when rule fue3a is applied: if the
attribute value is &amp;quot;source&amp;quot;, the rule matches all np
satisfying the remaining rule conditions, whereas if
the attribute value is &amp;quot;ambiguous&amp;quot;, the rule re-
quires that the np contain a person or institution in-
dicator. The rule does not apply if the attribute
value is &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot;.
Some of the message rules (not shown here)
check that the final opinion verb attribute has the
value &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, indicating that it accepts a subordinate
clause (dijo que ... / he said that ...). These rules la-
bel the proposition following the verb as a mes-
sage. The proposition has already been segmented
by Clatex.
The attribute that indicates which is the verb
subject role is important in differentiating the rules
shown in the table (fue1 to fue4), which only re-
cognize verbs for which the subject role is source,
from a set of additional rules (not shown in the
table) that look for the source in the dative case,
when the subject role is topic (la propuesta gustó
a los senadores / senators liked the proposal).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999608">
3.3 Semantic orientation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863">
For each element recognized, the rules assign a se-
mantic orientation value. For the opinion predicate,
source and topic this value comes from the lexical
resources. For the message, this value is calculated
from its subjective elements and operators. We
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995679">
58
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999277142857143">
consider that the final opinion semantic orientation
can be calculated from the orientation values of its
elements. We hypothesize that when the opinion
predicate or the topic introducer are not neutral
(they have a positive or negative semantic orienta-
tion) the complete opinion takes on the same value
and there is no need to analyze the message. If
these two elements are neutral the opinion semant-
ic orientation must be obtained from the message.
To determine the message semantic orientation
we carried out some experiments that are still on-
going. Semantic orientation values for opinion pre-
dicates are stated in the verb and noun lists, as
mentioned. The semantic orientation for topic in-
troducers is also stated in the corresponding list
(sobre / about is neutral, en contra de / against is
negative, etc.). The number of elements of this
type is very limited. We did not study the source
semantic orientation, in future work we will ana-
lyze expressions like Los optimistas sostienen
que ... / Optimists say that ....

4 System evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992468">
To evaluate the system we worked with a digit-
al media corpus; the texts were taken from the
same publications as those used to create the deriv-
ation corpus. The corpus contains 38 texts with an
average of 300 words each, making a total size of
approximately 13,000 words.
We applied the system to the entire corpus and
performed a manual review of the output in order
to evaluate the identification of the defined ele-
ments and also the complete opinion identification.
We also made a partial semantic orientation evalu-
ation, taking into account only opinion predicates
and topic introducers&apos; values and their effect on the
complete opinion value.
In addition to assessing the rules performance,
during the review stage the annotated corpus was
manually corrected in order to obtain an opinion
annotated corpus suitable for machine-learning.

Freeling also provides a dependency parser that

scored poorly in sentences containing opinions.
Resources such as a semantic role tagger or an
anaphora resolution tool could no doubt improve
our system, but as far as we know they are not

The set of opinion predicates includes verbs, nouns and prepositions (or prepositional locutions). Verbs belong to various semantic classes: communication (decir / say, declarar / state), assessment (criticar / criticize, felicitar / compliment), belief (creer / believe, opinar / think) and acceptance (aceptar / accept, rechazar / reject). These classes are similar to those proposed in (Asher et al., 2008), the main difference being that they include the class Sentiment but we do not. Nouns are generally derived from the aforementioned verbs (opinión / opinion, declaración / statement, apoyo / support). Some prepositions and prepositional locutions are según, de acuerdo a, para / according to. The relevant arguments that we identified for the opinion predicates are, as already mentioned, source, topic and message. To establish this scheme we analysed syntactico-semantic schemes proposed in ADESSE2 for selected verb classes (García-Miguel et al., 2005) and some of the Spanish FrameNet frames3 (S</context>

Note that in (5) there is another opinion predicate, the verb criticize, occurring in a non-factive context. The factivity of events is not addressed in this work, but it can be expected to affect opinion recognition. 3 The rule-based system We developed a rule-based system for the identification of the opinion elements. The system takes as input a pre-processed text using the POS-tagger Freeling (Atserias et al., 2006) and Clatex (Wonsever et al, 2006), a system that segments texts into propositions. Several rule modules are then applied, introducing XML annotations showing the identified opinions and their elements. The following example illustrates the system output: 56 &lt;opinion&gt;&lt;menssage&gt;Hasta el momento el virus H1N1 tiene una predominancia mayor que la de los demás virus en esos estudios&lt;/message&gt;, &lt;predicate&gt;precisó&lt;/predicate&gt;&lt;source&gt;la ministra&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/opinion&gt;. &lt;opinion&gt;&lt;message&gt;So far, the H1N1 virus has a higher prevalence than other viruses in these studies&lt;/message&gt;, &lt;predicate&gt;said&lt;/predicat</context>

Identifying subjective elements is necessary in order to determine the semantic orientation of the opinion. We think the treatment of these elements within the author’s message is similar to the treatment that must be applied within the message attributed to any other source. Such a treatment is not addressed in this work, since the semantic orientation study presented here is restricted to opinion predicates and topic introducers. In some respects our work is related to that of (Bethard et al., 2004). For opinions introduced by opinion verbs, they identify the source (opinion holder) and the message (propositional opinion), restricting the study to messages that constitute subordinate clauses. However, we seek also to identify the explicit references to the topic and we consider not only verbs but also some nouns and prepositions such as según / according to.

Several sources and topics were partially recognized because the rules do not incorporate some complements (prepositional complements or subordinate clause) to the noun phrase.

This style is usually present in journalistic texts (Maldonado, 1999). 4.1 Semantic orientation evaluation We recognized 25 non neutral opinion predicates in the corpus: 12 positive verbs and 14 negative verbs. One verb (especular / speculate) was incorrectly assigned a negative value, its means in this particular context is neutral. We just found 3 non-neutral topic introducers, the 3 are negative.

To complete the opinion, we identify its characteristic arguments: the source, the topic and the message. In addition to recognizing an opinion, we try to determine its semantic orientation. To this end, we consider certain subjective elements and operators (reverse, intensifier, enhancing, neutralizing, etc.) which affect them. In this article, we present only results on the semantic orientation of opinion verbs, opinion nouns and topic introducers (sobre/about, con respecto a/with respect to, etc.). There are many studies that address these issues: Pang and Lee (2008), for instance, discuss in Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2010 Young Investigators Workshop on Computational Approaches to Languages of the Americas, pages 54–61, Los Angeles, California, June 2010. c�2010 Association for Computational Linguistics detail various concepts in the area of &amp;quot;Opinion Mining&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Sentiment Analysis&amp;quot; and present the main proposals, resources and applications.

Some of them were created especially in the context of this work and are available as a contribution to the development of Spanish text processing: • opinion verbs and nouns lists with syntactic and semantic attributes, • person and institution indicators lists, • topic introducers list, • subjective elements lists, created from available resources for Spanish (Redondo et al, 2007) and English (General Inquirer: www.wjh.harvard.edu), the latter translated into Spanish, • subjective operators list. We also used some resources that are available for Spanish, including: • Freeling (POS-tagger), • Clatex (propositions analyzer). Freeling also provides a dependency parser that was not used here because the tests we carried out scored poorly in sentences containing opinions. Resources such as a semantic role tagger or an anaphora resolution tool could no doubt improve our system, but as far as we know they are not available for Spanish.

Our definition deviates from much of the literature on this subject because we limit our work to opinions introduced by an opinion predicate, as explained above, while many of the cited works identify all kinds of subjective expressions, mainly adjectives with positive or negative polarity, as with the expressive subjective elements described in (Wiebe et al., 2005). As in our work we focus on finding the source, the message and the topic for each opinion, we ignore all the text fragments in which there is no evidence that the author is quoting or referring to other participants’ opinions. These text fragments constitute the message, as defined above, stated by the text author. So, once our system has identified other participants’ opinions, the remaining text should be attributed to the text author. Identifying subjective elements is necessary in order to determine the semantic orientation of the opinion. We think the treatment of these elements within </context>

This type of rule allows the specification of contexts, exclusion zones, optionality, negation, and elimination of existing labels, among others. In addition, for each rule it is possible to check various conditions on its components, for example, membership in a list of words. For applying the rules we used a system implemented in Prolog. The hand-written rules were derived from corpus analysis.
