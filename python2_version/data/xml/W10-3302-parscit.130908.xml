We present a novel method for build-
ing a large-scale Japanese ontology from
Wikipedia using one of the largest
Japanese thesauri, Nihongo Goi-Taikei
(referred to hereafter as “Goi-Taikei”) as
an upper ontology. First, The leaf cat-
egories in the Goi-Taikei hierarchy are
semi-automatically aligned with seman-
tically equivalent Wikipedia categories.
Then, their subcategories are created au-
tomatically by detecting is-a links in the
Wikipedia category network below the
junction using the knowledge defined in
Goi-Taikei above the junction. The re-
sulting ontology has a well-defined taxon-
omy in the upper level and a fine-grained
taxonomy in the lower level with a large
number of up-to-date instances. A sam-
ple evaluation shows that the precisions of
the extracted categories and instances are
92.8% and 98.6%, respectively.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999735">
In recent years, we have become increasingly
aware of the need for up-to-date knowledge bases
offering broad-coverage in order to implement
practical semantic inference engines for advanced
applications such as question answering, summa-
rization and textual entailment recognition. One
promising approach involves automatically ex-
tracting a large comprehensive ontology from
Wikipedia, a freely available online encyclopedia
with a wide variety of information. One problem
with previous such efforts is that the resulting on-
tology is either fragmentary or trivial.
Ponzetto and Strube (2007) presents a set of
lightweight heuristics such as head matching and
modifier matching for distinguishing between is-
a and not-is-a links in the Wikipedia category
network. The most powerful heuristics is head
matching in which a category link is labeled as
is-a if the two categories share the same head
lemma, such as CAPITALS IN ASIA and CAPI-
TALS. For Japanese, Sakurai et al. (2008) present
a method equivalent to head matching in Japanese.
As Japanese is a head final language, they intro-
duced a heuristics called suffix matching in which
a category link is labeled as is-a if one category
is the suffix of the other category, such as
(airports in Japan) and (airports). The
problem with the ontology extracted by these two
methods is that it is not a single interconnected
taxonomy, but a set of taxonomic trees.
One way to make a single taxonomy is to use
an existing large-scale taxonomy as a core for the
resulting ontology. In YAGO, Suchanek et al.
(2007) merged English WordNet and Wikipedia
by adding instances (namely Wikipedia articles)
to the is-a hierarchy of WordNet. Of the cate-
gories assigned to a Wikipedia article, they re-
garded one with a plural head noun as the article’s
hypernym, which is called a conceptual category.
They then linked the conceptual category to a
WordNet synset by heuristic rules including head
matching. For Japanese, Kobayashi et al. (2008)
present an attempt equivalent to YAGO, where
they merged Goi-Taikei and Japanese Wikipedia.
The problem with these two methods is that the
core taxonomy is extended only one level al-
though many new instances are added. They can-
not make the most of the fine-grained taxonomic

In this paper, we present a novel method for
building a single interconnected ontology from
Wikipedia, with a fine-grained taxonomy in the
lower level, by using a manually constructed the-
saurus as its upper ontology. In the following
sections, we first describe the language resources
used in this work. We then describe a semi-
automatic method for building the ontology and

2.1 Nihongo Goi-Taikei
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997837444444444">
Nihongo Goi-Taikei ( , ‘compre-
hensive outline of Japanese vocabulary’)1 is one
of the largest and best known Japanese thesauri
(Ikehara et al., 1997). It was originally developed
as a dictionary for a Japanese-to-English machine
translation system in the early 90’s. It was then
published as a book in 5 volumes in 1997 and as
a CD-ROM in 1999. It contains about 300,000
Japanese words and the meanings of each word
are described by using 2,715 hierarchical seman-
tic categories. Each word has up to 5 semantic
categories in order of frequency in use, and each
category is assigned with a unique ID number and
category name such as 4:person and 388:place2.
Goi-Taikei has different semantic category hi-
erarchies for common nouns, proper nouns, and
verbs, respectively. We used only the common
noun category in this work. For simplicity, we
mapped all proper nouns in the proper noun cate-
gory to the equivalent common noun category us-
ing the category mapping table shown in the Goi-
Taikei book.
Figure 1 shows the top three layers for common
nouns3. For example, the transliterated Japanese
word raita ( ) has two semantic cate-
gories 353:author and 915:household appli-
ance. The former originates with the English

word “writer” while the latter originates with En-
glish word “lighter”. By climbing up the Goi-
Taikei category hierarchy, we can infer that the
former refers to a human being (4:person) while
the latter refers to a physical object (533:con-
crete object).

2.2 Japanese Wikipedia
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99919988">
Wikipedia is a free, multilingual, on-line ency-
clopedia actively developed by a large number of
volunteers. Japanese Wikipedia now has about
500,000 articles. Figure 2 shows examples of an
article page and a category page. An article page
has a title, body, and categories. In most articles,
the first sentence of the body gives the definition
of the title. A category also has a title, body, and
categories. Its title is prefixed with “Category:”
and its body includes a list of articles that belong
to the category.
Although the Wikipedia category system is or-
ganized in a hierarchal manner, it is not a tax-
onomy but a thematic classification. An article
could belong to many categories and the category
network has loops. The relations between linked
categories are chaotic, but the lower the category
link is in the hierarchy, the more it is likely to be
an is-a relation. For example, the category link
between (COCKTAIL) and (ALCO-
HOLIC BEVERAGE) is an is-a relation. Although
the article (shaker) is in the category
(COCKTAIL), a shaker is not a cocktail
but an appliance. Extracting a taxonomy from the
Wikipedia category network is not trivial.

Figure 3 shows an outline of the proposed ontol-
ogy building method. We first semi-automatically
align each leaf category in the Goi-Taikei category
hierarchy with one or more Wikipedia categories.
We call a Wikipedia category aligned with a Goi-
Taikei category a junction category. We then ex-
tend each Goi-Taikei leaf category by detecting
the is-a links below the junction category in the
Wikipedia category network using the knowledge
defined above the junction category in Goi-Taikei

3.1 Category Alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997705">
For each leaf category in Goi-Taikei, we first make
a list of junction category candidates. Wikipedia
categories satisfying at least one of the following
three conditions are extracted as candidates:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.966316625">
• The Goi-Taikei category name exactly
matches the Wikipedia category name.
• One of the instances of the Goi-Taikei cate-
gory exactly matches the Wikipedia category
name.
• More than two instances of the Goi-Taikei
category exactly match either instances or
subcategories of the Wikipedia category.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959931034483">
Here, an instance of a Goi-Taikei category refers
to words belonging to the Goi-Taikei category
while that of a Wikipedia category refers to the
title (name) of articles belonging to the Wikipedia
category.
If a Goi-Taikei category and a Wikipedia cate-
gory refer to the same concept, we regard them
as semantically equivalent. If an instance of a
Goi-Taikei category and a Wikipedia category re-
fer to the same concept, we regard the name of
the Goi-Taikei instance as a subcategory of the
Goi-Taikei category and regard the subcategory
and the Wikipedia category as semantically equiv-
alent.
This is a sort of word sense disambiguation
problem. For example, Wikipedia category
(ROCKET) exactly matches the word
in Goi-Taikei, which has two semantic
categories, 990:aircraft (rocket) and 834:acces-
sories (locket). Only the 990:aircraft sense of
the word in Goi-Taikei matches the Wikipedia cat-
egory.
We performed manual alignment because the
accuracy of this category alignment is very im-
portant as regards the subsequent steps. Manual
alignment is feasible and cost effective since there
are only 1,921 leaves in the Goi-Taikei category
hierarchy. However, we also report the result of
automatic alignment in the experiment.

3.2 Hypernym Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96639790909091">
As preparation for detecting is-a links in the
Wikipedia category network, we automatically
extract a hypernym of the name of each article and
category in advance.
We regard the first sentence of each article page
as the definition of the concept referred to by
the title. We applied language dependent lexico-
syntactic patterns to the definition sentence to ex-
tract the hypernym. The hypernym of the category
name is extracted from the definition sentence if it
exists. If there is an article whose title is the same
as its category, the hypernym of the article is used
as that of the category.
As for lexico-syntactic patterns, we used almost
the same patterns described in previous work re-
lated to Japanese such as (Kobayashi et al., 2008;
Sumida et al., 2008), which is basically equivalent
to work related to English such as (Hearst, 1992).
Here are some examples.
(one|kind|name|... ) of [hypernym]
[hypernym](  ||... )
(is a|refers to|... ) [hypernym]
[hypernym]&lt;EOS&gt;
&lt;BOS&gt;[hypernym]
where &lt;BOS&gt; and &lt;EOS&gt; refer to the begin-
ning and the end of a sentence.
For example, from the first article in Figure 2,
the words (alcoholic beverage)
are extracted as the hypernym of the article
(cocktail), using the third lexico-syntactic pat-
tern above. Since the title of the article is the same
as the category name, (alcoholic
beverage) is regarded as the hypernym of the cat-

We automatically detect is-a links in the
Wikipedia category network to extend the origi-
nal Goi-Taikei category hierarchy. Starting from
a junction category, we recursively traverse the
Wikipedia category network if the link from the
current category to the child category is regarded
as an is-a link.
We regard a link between a parent category and
a child category as an is-a link if the suffix of the
child category name matches one of the hypernym

candidates for the child category. We define the
hypernym candidates for a category as the union
of the following words:
• The names of three super categories in Goi-
Taikei from the junction category, namely the
leaf category, its parent, and its grandparent.

<listItem confidence="0.940472666666667">

Wikipedia from the current category to the
junction category.
We also regard a link as being is-a if the suffix
of the hypernym (defined in Sec 3.2) of the child
category name matches one of the hypernym can-
didates for the child category.
Figure 4 shows examples. The link between
the category (DISTILLED BEVERAGES)
and the category (WHISKIES) in
Wikipedia is regarded as is-a because the word
(whisky) is an instance of Goi-Taikei
category 861:liquor just above the junction cat-
egory (ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES). The link
between the category ALCOHOLIC BEVER-
AGES and the category (COCKTAILS) in
Wikipedia is regarded as is-a because the suffix
of (alcoholic beverage), the hy-
pernym of the category (COCKTAILS),
matches (beverage), an instance of the cate-
gory 857:beverages in Goi-Taikei. However, the
link between the category (ALCOHOLIC BEV-
ERAGES) and the category (GODS OF ALCO-
HOLIC BEVERAGES) in Wikipedia is not is-a be-
cause the two Japanese strings do not have a com-
mon suffix.

hypernym (defined in Sec 3.2) matches one of the
hypernym candidates (defined in Sec 3.3) of the
article.
Figure 5 (a) shows examples. The link between
the article (earthquake) and the
category (COCKTAILS) is is-a because
(cocktail), the hypernym of the arti-
cle name (earthquake), exactly
matches the parent category name. The link be-
tween the article (aperitif) and the category
(COCKTAILS) is is-a because the suffix
of (aperitif) matches the junction category
(ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES). The link between
the article (shaker) and the category
(COCKTAILS) is not is-a because nei-
ther the suffix of the category name
(shaker) nor that of its hypernym (appliance)
matches any hypernym candidates of the article

For each of the 1,921 Goi-Taikei leaf categories
with the total of 108,247 instances, we applied the
three conditions described in Sec 3.1 and obtained
6,301 Wikipedia categories as junction category
candidates. We then manually selected 2,477 cat-
egories as the junction categories. The number of
Goi-Taikei leaf categories with one or more junc-
tion categories is 719 (719/1921=38.4%).
We performed some preliminary experiments
on the automatic selection of junction cate-
gories. We trained an SVM classifier us-
ing the above junction category candidates
and manual judgement results. Given a pair
consisting of a Goi-Taikei category and a
Wikipedia category, the SVM classifier pre-
dicts whether or not the two categories should
be aligned. We used standard ontology map-
ping features (Euzenat and Shavaiko, 2007) such
as whether the (classlinstance) name of the
(self|parent|children|siblings) match one and the
other. We undertook a fivefold cross validation
and obtained about 90% precision and 70% recall.
The results were encouraging but we decided to
use the manual alignment results for subsequent
experiments.

link detection accuracy for the Wikipedia category
network by employing the following two criteria:

the number of categories at each depth.
The parent-child precision is more than 90%

average number of instances for a category is 17.8.
We evaluate the accuracy of instance extraction
as follows: For each category in the constructed
hierarchy, we list all its articles, and construct a
pair consisting of a category and an article. We
randomly sample these pairs and leave only the
pairs in which all the links from its category to the
root are is-a relations by manual inspection. For
319 category-article pairs obtained by this proce-
dure, 247 articles are manually classified as in-
stances of the category, while 208 articles are au-

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942896551724">
In this paper, we presented a method for building
a large-scale, Japanese ontology from Wikipedia
using one of the most popular Japanese thesauri,
Nihongo Goi-Taikei, as its upper ontology. Unlike
previous methods, it can create a single connected
taxonomy with a well-defined upper level taxon-
omy inherited from Goi-Taikei, as well as a fined-
grained and up-to-date lower level taxonomy with
broad-coverage extracted from Wikipedia.
Future work will include automatic category
alignment between Goi-Taikei and Wikipedia to
fully automate the ontology building. It would
be interesting to use another Japanese thesaurus,
such as the recently released Japanese WordNet
(Bond et al., 2008), as an upper ontology for the
proposed method.
One of the problems with the proposed method
is that it only uses about half of the knowledge
(categories and articles) in Wikipedia. This is be-
cause we restricted the alignment points in Goi-
Taikei category hierarchy to its leaves. In Ponzetto
and Navigli (2009), they present a method for
aligning WordNet and Wikipedia fully at many
levels with both of them retaining a hierarchal
structure. However, their method does not inte-
grate the two hierarchies into a single taxonomy.
We think that developing a method for merging
the two hierarchies into one taxonomy is the key
to extracting more information from Wikipedia.

<abstract confidence="0.994499">We present a novel method for building a large-scale Japanese ontology from Wikipedia using one of the largest thesauri, Goi-Taikei (referred to hereafter as “Goi-Taikei”) as an upper ontology. First, The leaf categories in the Goi-Taikei hierarchy are semi-automatically aligned with semantically equivalent Wikipedia categories. Then, their subcategories are created auby detecting in the Wikipedia category network below the junction using the knowledge defined in Goi-Taikei above the junction. The resulting ontology has a well-defined taxonomy in the upper level and a fine-grained taxonomy in the lower level with a large number of up-to-date instances. A sample evaluation shows that the precisions of the extracted categories and instances are 92.8% and 98.6%, respectively.</abstract>

Unlike previous methods, it can create a single connected taxonomy with a well-defined upper level taxonomy inherited from Goi-Taikei, as well as a finedgrained and up-to-date lower level taxonomy with broad-coverage extracted from Wikipedia. Future work will include automatic category alignment between Goi-Taikei and Wikipedia to fully automate the ontology building. It would be interesting to use another Japanese thesaurus, such as the recently released Japanese WordNet (Bond et al., 2008), as an upper ontology for the proposed method. One of the problems with the proposed method is that it only uses about half of the knowledge (categories and articles) in Wikipedia. This is because we restricted the alignment points in GoiTaikei category hierarchy to its leaves. In Ponzetto and Navigli (2009), they present a method for aligning WordNet and Wikipedia fully at many levels with both of them retaining a hierarchal structure. However, their method does not integrate the two hierarchies into a single taxonomy. We think that developing a method for merging the two hierarchies into on</context>

We then manually selected 2,477 categories as the junction categories. The number of Goi-Taikei leaf categories with one or more junction categories is 719 (719/1921=38.4%). We performed some preliminary experiments on the automatic selection of junction categories. We trained an SVM classifier using the above junction category candidates and manual judgement results. Given a pair consisting of a Goi-Taikei category and a Wikipedia category, the SVM classifier predicts whether or not the two categories should be aligned. We used standard ontology mapping features (Euzenat and Shavaiko, 2007) such as whether the (classlinstance) name of the (self|parent|children|siblings) match one and the other. We undertook a fivefold cross validation and obtained about 90% precision and 70% recall. The results were encouraging but we decided to use the manual alignment results for subsequent experiments. 16 Figure 6: The precision of is-a links classified by the depth in the constructed category hierarchy 4.2 Is-a Link Detection We extracted 23,289 categories from 49,543 categories in Wikipedia (47%) to extend the GoiTaikei category hierarchy.

One promising approach involves automatically extracting a large comprehensive ontology from Wikipedia, a freely available online encyclopedia with a wide variety of information. One problem with previous such efforts is that the resulting ontology is either fragmentary or trivial. Ponzetto and Strube (2007) presents a set of lightweight heuristics such as head matching and modifier matching for distinguishing between isa and not-is-a links in the Wikipedia category network. The most powerful heuristics is head matching in which a category link is labeled as is-a if the two categories share the same head lemma, such as CAPITALS IN ASIA and CAPITALS. For Japanese, Sakurai et al. (2008) present a method equivalent to head matching in Japanese.
