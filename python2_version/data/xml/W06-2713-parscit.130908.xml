We present an XML annotation format
(MEANING Annotation Format, MAF)
specifically designed to represent and in-
tegrate different levels of linguistic anno-
tations and a tool that provides flexible
access to them (MEANING Browser).
We describe our experience in integrating
linguistic annotations coming from dif-
ferent sources, and the solutions we
adopted to implement efficient access to
corpora annotated with the Meaning
Format.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964263157895">
It is well known that when using XML-based
annotation schemes to represent multi layer an-
notations, it can be difficult to handle partially
overlapping annotations. Annotating discontinu-
ous elements may be considered as a variant of
the same problem (Pianta and Bentivogli, 2004).
Other difficulties can arise from the necessity of
integrating manual and automatic annotations, as
we will show in this paper.
One of the most effective solutions to the
above mentioned problems is the so called stand-
off annotation, based on the separation between
textual data and annotations, and between vari-
ous types of annotation, possibly pointing to
same text. This approach has been systematically
adopted in the design of MAF, a multilayer XML
format developed for the EU-funded MEANING
project, in the context of the creation of the Ital-
ian MEANING Corpus (Bentivogli et al., 2003).
In this paper we will describe our experience
in the use of MAF, with special emphasis on how
we solved issues related to representing annota-
tion levels which come from different sources,
and can possibly overlap. We will also give de-
tails about the solutions we adopted to allow for
efficient access and human browsing of MAF
standoff annotations.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes MAF and the types of anno-
tations which have been represented with it. Sec-
tion 3 reports on the integration into MAF of lin-
guistic annotations coming from different
sources. Section 4 illustrates the strategies
adopted to make the information encoded in
MAF quickly accessible. Finally, Section 5 pre-
sents the MEANING Browser, a tool for access-
ing and navigating corpora linguistically anno-
tated with MAF.

2 The MEANING Format
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995625">
Following the proposals for the ISO/TC 37/SC 4
standard for linguistic resources (Ide and
Romary, 2002), the MAF scheme is based on
annotation structures and data categories. Each
type of annotation structure (nestable &lt;struct&gt;
elements) corresponds to a specific kind of lin-
guistic object (e.g. tokens, lexical units, multi-
words), and each instance of a linguistic object is
identified by a unique identifier. Data categories
(&lt;feat&gt; tags) represent attributes of the linguistic
objects. Different representation levels are con-
tained in separate documents, or document sec-
tions. The XLink and XPointer syntax is used to
represent relations between elements in different
XML documents, and IDREFs attributes for rela-
tions within the same document.

The first version of the MEANING Format has
been used to represent seven kinds of informa-
tion: orthographic features, the structure of the

text, morphosyntactic information, multiwords,
syntactic information, named entities, and word
senses.
Annotation levels are related to each other fol-
lowing a hierarchy of annotation levels, which
reflects a theoretically grounded hierarchy of
linguistic objects. The basic (orthographic) anno-
tation level, representing tokens, is implemented
with pointers to the character positions in the hub
corpus. Then the morphosyntactic level, repre-
senting word-related morphological information,
contains pointers to the tokens, whereas the mul-
tiword level points to the words described at
morphosyntactic level.
The following example shows how the mor-
phosyntactic features of the Italian word “an-
dare” (to go) are represented.
&lt;struc type=&amp;quot;w-level&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;w_12&amp;quot;
xlink:href=&amp;quot;#xpointer(id(&apos;t_10&apos;))&amp;quot;&gt;
&lt;feat type=&amp;quot;lemma&amp;quot;&gt;andare&lt;/feat&gt;
&lt;feat type=&amp;quot;stem&amp;quot;&gt;and&lt;/feat&gt;
&lt;feat type=&amp;quot;pos&amp;quot;&gt;v&lt;/feat&gt;
&lt;feat type=&amp;quot;elra-tag&amp;quot;&gt;VF&lt;/feat&gt;
&lt;feat type=&amp;quot;mood&amp;quot;&gt;inf&lt;/feat&gt;
&lt;feat type=&amp;quot;tense&amp;quot;&gt;pres&lt;/feat&gt;
&lt;/struc&gt;
MAF also specifically addresses the problem
of discontinuous units, such as for instance non-
contiguous multiwords; see “andarci veramente
piano” (take it really easy). A detailed study of
how standoff annotation allows for an elegant
treatment of this phenomenon can be found in
(Pianta and Bentivogli 2004).

2.2 Second version
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970333333334">
The first version of the MEANING Format has
recently been extended within the FU-PAT ON-
TOTEXT project (Magnini et al. 2005).
Within this project, we are creating the Italian
Content Annotation Bank (I-CAB), a corpus of
Italian news stories annotated with different
kinds of semantic information. Annotation is be-
ing carried out manually, as we intend I-CAB to
become a benchmark for automatic Information
Extraction and Ontology Population tasks, in-
cluding recognition and normalization of various
types of entities, temporal expressions, relations
between entities, and relations between entities
and temporal expressions (e.g. the relation date-
of-birth connecting a person to a date).
To fulfill I-CAB annotation needs, we ex-
tended MAF, by adding a number of new lin-
guistic annotation levels, i.e.:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9762495">
• temporal expressions
• entities of type person and organization
• mentions (i.e. the textual expressions re-
ferring to the entities)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998737769230769">
According to the hierarchical approach to rep-
resenting relations between annotation levels in
the first version of the MEANING Format, tem-
poral expressions and entity mentions are repre-
sented with pointers to morphosyntactic level
entities. Entities, instead, are represented with
pointers to entity mentions.
To manually annotate temporal expressions
we followed the TIMEX2 markup standard,
while to mark entities and mentions we relied on
the ACE entity detection task guidelines. To per-
form the annotation task we used Callisto
(http://callisto.mitre.org).

<bodyText confidence="0.978421533333333">
The manual annotations produced through Cal-
listo, which is related to novel annotation levels
such as temporal expressions and entity men-
tions, had to be integrated with more traditional
annotations which are performed automatically
with the TextPro tool, an automatic linguistic
analysis Tool Suite developed at ITC-irst.

As one can see in the above figure, two different
annotation processes (automatic and manual)
produce two different formats which must be
converted and integrated into MAF in order to be
accessed by the MEANING Browser (or any
other NLP tool).

and multiword recognition. The results of
TextPro analyses are represented in a table,
where each token is on a row, and columns con-
tain multiple annotation levels. Converting from
the TextPro to the MEANING Format requires
retrieving the character positions of tokens in the
hub corpus, which are not directly available in
the TextPro output.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998714">
3.2 From AIF format to MEANING format
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987135135135">
The Callisto manual annotation tool produces a
coding format called AIF (Atlas Interchange For-
mat), which implements a stand-off XML anno-
tation scheme.
When using the Callisto graphical interface,
all annotations of temporal expressions and en-
tity mentions are carried out by selecting a se-
quence of contiguous characters. As a conse-
quence, all AIF annotations make reference to
character positions.
However, from Section 2.2 we know that in
MAF temporal expressions and entity mentions
make reference to morphosyntactic linguistic
objects, not characters. This implies that, to go
from AIF to the MEANING Format, we need to
translate annotations making reference to the po-
sition of characters into annotations that point to
morphological entities. More precisely, we need
to substitute pointers to character positions with
pointers to morphosyntactic objects which have
been marked automatically by TextPro. Carrying
out this step will also achieve the integration of
manual and automatic annotations.
The integration step is possible because the
MAF hierarchy of annotation levels points, at the
lowest level, to character positions. By following
the hierarchy of links relating the various annota-
tion levels it is always possible to trace back a
linguistic object to some sequence of characters
in the raw text, and in the opposite direction,
given a string, we know what linguistic objects
correspond to it. Summing up, the integration of
AIF annotations into MAF requires that, given
the character positions contained in the AIF an-
notation of some string, we substitute the point-
ers to characters with the pointers to the linguis-
tic objects that cover the same string.

4 Data Access
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998612">
MAF turned out to be a flexible and expressive
means to represent and integrate multiple levels
of linguistic annotation. This was achieved
mainly thanks to the adoption of the standoff
annotation approach. However accessing and
retrieving information spread in possibly very
large repositories (hundreds of thousands) of
XML files may be a challenging task even for
Database Management Systems specifically de-
signed to handle XML. To solve this problem we
first analyzed existing native XML databases
such as eXist, and Apache Xindice, but found
that what was available at the time did not suited
our needs. For this reason we approached the
access problem through a two-fold strategy:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98680325">
• converting XML data into a relational
database
• indexing XML data and accessing them
through a search engine (LUCENE)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964230769231">
The conversion of MAF data into a relational
database is based on the following strategy. Each
annotation level is mapped into a table, where
rows represent instances of the relevant linguistic
object (e.g. words), and columns represent its
attributes (e.g. lemma, PoS, etc). Specific col-
umns contain the object identifiers and the point-
ers to objects of other types/tables.
Once MAF data are stored in a relational data-
base, they can be accessed quite efficiently.
However, when the access to data requires joins
of many tables, access times become incompati-
ble with various kinds of applications, such as
on-line corpus browsing. For this reason we tried
to complement the use of a relational database
with the exploitation of the indexing capability
of the LUCENE search engine
(http://lucene.apache.org/). To this extent we
modified the LUCENE analyzer so as to be able
to parse XML structures. In this way LUCENE
can be configured in order to index any XML
structure.
The fast access capabilities of a relational da-
tabase combined with the extended indexing ca-
pabilities of LUCENE enabled us to implement a
browser of MAF annotated corpora.

5 The MEANING Browser
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999818888888889">
The MEANING Browser can be used by humans
to navigate any corpus encoded with MAF. The
browser is built upon an API which can be used
by any automatic system.
In the following, we are going to demonstrate
how I-CAB texts and their annotations can be
accessed through the MEANING Browser.
The first kind of access to the corpus is word-
oriented, and amounts to a concordancer, i.e. a
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999987483870968">
tool able to provide all the occurrences of a cer-
tain word in the corpus. The user can alterna-
tively search for all occurrences of a word form,
or a lemma, possibly constraining the search to a
certain PoS. Free combinations between these
constraints are allowed. The system will return a
KWIC-like concordance of all the tokens in the
corpus that match the request, within a chosen
word window. By clicking on the magnifying
glass, one can see the sentence in which the
searched word occurs (see Appendix 1).
By clicking on a specific icon a new window
is opened where the whole text is displayed and
its linguistic annotations are made accessible. A
number of graphical widgets allow the user to
highlight the desired annotations: e.g. nouns,
verbs, multiwords, temporal expressions, men-
tions of a specific entity.
In Appendix 2 the browser is used to show
both nouns (automatically annotated) and entity
mentions (from manual annotation). Appendix 3
shows time expressions and discontinuous mul-
tiwords; see how the multiword “ha rassegnato
... le dimissioni” (he resigned) is made discon-
tinuous by the occurrence of a time expression
ieri (yesterday). The browser will also give mor-
phosyntactic information about single words
composing multiwords (governo, government).
From the same window one can access the XML
files encoding multiple annotation levels for the
same document.
