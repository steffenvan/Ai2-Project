We demonstrate the open-source LKB

1 Overview of the LKB system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999766633333333">
The LKB system is a grammar development
environment that is distributed as part of the
open source LinGO tools (http://www-
csli.stanford.edu/˜aac/lkb.html
and http://lingo.stanford.edu, see
also Copestake and Flickinger, 2000). It is an
open-source grammar development environment
implemented in Common Lisp, distributed not
only as source but also as a standalone application
that can be run on Linux, Solaris and Windows
(see the website for specific requirements). It
will also run under Macintosh Common Lisp,
but for this a license is required. The LKB in-
cludes a parser, generator, support for large-scale
inheritance hierarchies (including the use of
defaults), various tools for manipulating semantic
representations, a rich set of graphical tools
for analyzing and debugging grammars, and
extensive on-line documentation. Grammars of
all sizes have been written using the LKB, for
several languages, mostly within the linguistic
frameworks of Categorial Grammar and Head-
Driven Phrase Structure Grammar. The LKB
system was initially developed in 1991, but has
gone through multiple versions since then. It
is in active use by a considerable number of
researchers worldwide. An introductory book
on implementing grammars in typed feature
structure formalisms using the LKB is near
completion (Copestake, in preparation).

Although the LKB has been successfully used for
large-scale grammar development, this demon-
stration will concentrate on its use with relatively
small scale teaching grammars, of a type which
can be developed by students in practical exer-
cises. We will show an English grammar frag-
ment which is linked to a textbook on formal syn-
tax (Sag and Wasow, 1999) to illustrate how the
system may be used in conjunction with more tra-
ditional materials in a relatively linguistically ori-
ented course. We will demonstrate the tools for
analyzing parses and for debugging and also dis-
cuss the way that parse selection mechanisms can
be incorporated in the system. If time permits, we
will show how semantic analyses produced with a
somewhat more complex grammar can be linked
up to a theorem prover and also exploited in se-
mantic transfer for Machine Translation. Exer-
cises where the grammar is part of a larger system
are generally appropriate for advanced courses or
for NLP application courses.
The screen dump in the figure is from a session
working with a grammar fragment for Esperanto.
This shares its basic types and rules with the
English textbook grammar fragment mentioned
above. The windows shown are:

4. Parse tree for La knabo dormas (the boy
sleeps): a larger display for parse trees is
also available, but this scale is useful for
summary information. Menus associated
with trees allow for display of associated se-

play shows inflectional rules as well as nor-
mal syntactic rules: hence the VP node un-
der dormas, which corresponds to the stem.

the source file for the lexicon associated with
this grammar.1 It shows the entry for the lex-

eme dorm, which, like most lexical entries in
this grammar, just specifies a spelling and a
type (here intrans-verb).
6. Part of the parse chart corresponding to the
tree is shown in the bottom window: nodes
which have knabo as a descendant are high-
lighted. Again, these nodes are active: one
very useful facility associated with them is a
unification checker which allows the gram-
mar writer to establish why a rule did not
apply to a phrase or phrases.

3 Use of the LKB in teaching
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997558425925926">
Teaching uses of the LKB have included under-
graduate and graduate courses on formal syntax
and on computational linguistics at several sites,
grammar engineering courses at two ESSLLI
summer schools, and numerous student projects
at undergraduate, masters and doctoral levels. An
advantage of the LKB is that students learn to use
a system which is sufficiently heavy duty for more
advanced work, up to the scale at least of research
although this causes some overhead, especially for students
who are only used to word processing programs.
prototypes. This provides them with a good plat-
form on which to build for further research. Feed-
back from the courses we have taught has mostly
been very positive, but we have found a ratio of
six students to one instructor (or teaching assis-
tant) to be the maximum that is workable. One
major reason is that debugging students’ gram-
mars and teaching debugging techniques is time-
consuming.
When teaching an introductory course with the
LKB, we start the students off with a very sim-
ple grammar, which they are asked to expand
in specific ways. We introduce various addi-
tional techniques and formal devices (such as in-
flectional and lexical rules, defaults, difference
lists and gaps) gradually during a course. Mate-
rial from our ESSLLI courses, including starting
grammars, exercises and solutions is distributed
via the website. Several other small grammars
developed by students are also distributed as part
of the LKB system and we would welcome fur-
ther contributions. We are hoping to facilitate this
by making it easier for people outside the LinGO
group to add and modify grammars.
Several graduate students have used versions
of the LKB system as part of their thesis work,
for diverse projects including machine transla-
tion and grammar learning. It has been used
in the development of several large grammars,
especially the LinGO English Resource Gram-
mar (ERG), which is itself open-source. Re-
search applications for the ERG include spoken
language machine translation in Verbmobil, gen-
eration for a speech prosthesis, and automated
email response, under development for commer-
cial use. The LKB/ERG combination can be used
by researchers who require a grammar which pro-
vides a detailed semantic analysis and reason-
ably broad coverage, for instance for experiments
on dialogue. The LKB has also been used as
a grammar preprocessor to facilitate experiments
on efficiency using the ERG with other systems
(Flickinger et al, 2000).

4 Comparison with other work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999818280487805">
There is a long history of the use of fea-
ture structure based systems in teaching, dat-
ing back at least to PATR (Shieber, 1986:
see http://www.ling.gu.se/˜li/). The
Alvey Natural Language Tools (Briscoe et al,
1987) have been used for teaching at several uni-
versities: Briscoe and Grover developed an ex-
tensive set of teaching examples and exercises,
which is however unpublished. Versions of the
SRI Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992) and
of the XTAG grammar (XTAG group, 1995) and
parser have also been used for teaching. Besides
the LKB, typed feature structure environments
have been used at many universities, though un-
like the systems cited above, most have only been
used with small grammars and may not scale
up. Hands on courses using various systems have
been run at many recent summer schools includ-
ing ESSLLI 99 (using the Xerox XLE, see Butt
et al, 1999) and ESSLLI 97 and the 1999 LSA
summer school (both using ConTroll, see Hin-
richs and Meurers, 1999). Very little seems to
have been formally published describing expe-
riences in teaching with grammar development
environments, though Bouma (1999) describes
material for teaching a computational linguistics
course that includes exercises using the Hdrug
unification-based enviroment to extend a gram-
mar.
Despite this rich variety of tools, we believe
that the LKB system has a combination of fea-
tures which make it distinctive and give it a useful
niche in teaching. The most important points are
that its availability as open source, combined with
scale and efficiency, allow advanced projects to be
supported as well as introductory courses. As far
as we are aware, it is the only system freely avail-
able with a broad coverage grammar that sup-
ports semantic interpretation and generation. Es-
pecially for more linguistically oriented courses,
the link to the Sag and Wasow textbook is also
important. Similar grammars could be developed
for other systems, but would be less directly com-
parable to the textbook since this assumes a de-
fault formalism which so far is only implemented
in the LKB.
On the other hand, the LKB is not a suitable ba-
sis for a course that involves the students learning
to implement a unifier, parser and so on. The sys-
tem is quite complex (about 120 files and 40,000
lines of Lisp code) and though the vast majority
of this is concerned with non-core functionality,
such as the graphical interfaces, it is still some-
what daunting. This seems an inevitable trade-
off of having a system powerful enough for real
applications (see Bouma (1999) for related dis-
cussion). It is questionable whether the LKB is
entirely satisfactory as a student’s first computa-
tional grammar system, although we have used it
with students who have no prior experience of this
sort: ideally we would suggest starting off with
brief exercises with a pure context-free grammar
to explain the concepts of well-formedness, re-
cursion and so on. We also wouldn’t necessar-
ily advocate using the LKB as a core component
of a first course on formal syntax for linguistic
students, since the specifics of dealing with an
implementation may interfere with understanding
of basic concepts, though it is suitable as a sup-
plement to an initial course or as the basis for a
slightly more advanced course.
We think there is considerable potential for
building materials for courses that allow students
to work with realistic but transparent applications
using the LKB and a large grammar as a compo-
nent. Developing such materials is clearly nec-
essary in order to give students useful practical
experience. It is however very time-consuming,
and most probably will have to be undertaken as
part of a cooperative, open-source development
involving people from several different institu-
tions.

Despite this rich variety of tools, we believe that the LKB system has a combination of features which make it distinctive and give it a useful niche in teaching. The most important points are that its availability as open source, combined with scale and efficiency, allow advanced projects to be supported as well as introductory courses.

On the other hand, the LKB is not a suitable basis for a course that involves the students learning to implement a unifier, parser and so on. The system is quite complex (about 120 files and 40,000 lines of Lisp code) and though the vast majority of this is concerned with non-core functionality, such as the graphical interfaces, it is still somewhat daunting. This seems an inevitable tradeoff of having a system powerful enough for real applications (see Bouma (1999) for related discussion). It is questionable whether the LKB is entirely satisfactory as a student’s first computational grammar system, although we have used it with students who have no prior experience of this sort: ideally we would suggest starting off with brief exercises with a pure context-free grammar to explain the concepts of well-formedness, recursion and so on. We also wouldn’t necessarily advocate using the LKB as a core component of a first course on formal syntax for linguistic students, since the specifics of dealing with an implementation may interfere with understanding of ba</context>

It is an open-source grammar development environment implemented in Common Lisp, distributed not only as source but also as a standalone application that can be run on Linux, Solaris and Windows (see the website for specific requirements). It will also run under Macintosh Common Lisp, but for this a license is required. The LKB includes a parser, generator, support for large-scale inheritance hierarchies (including the use of defaults), various tools for manipulating semantic representations, a rich set of graphical tools for analyzing and debugging grammars, and extensive on-line documentat</context>
