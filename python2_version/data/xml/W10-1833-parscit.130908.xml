We present our concept-annotation guidelines
for an large multi-institutional effort to create
a gold-standard manually annotated corpus of
full-text biomedical journal articles. We are
semantically annotating these documents with
the full term sets of eight large biomedical on-

from approximately 1,000 to millions of terms,
and, using these guidelines, we have been able
to perform this extremely challenging task

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999915537037037">
Manually annotated gold-standard corpora are
becoming increasingly critical for the develop-
ment of advanced NLP systems. At the same
time, the use of ontologies as formal representa-
tions of domain-specific knowledge is being seen
in a wide range of applications, particularly in
the biomedical domain. We are synergistically
creating a gold-standard corpus called the Col-
orado Richly Annotated Full-Text (CRAFT)
Corpus that pushes the boundaries of both of
these prominent types of resources. For this
project, we are manually annotating a collection
of 97 full-text biomedical journal articles com-
prising a total of more than 750,000 words, as
opposed to the sentences or abstracts upon which
other gold-standard corpora have focused. Addi-
tionally, while most other related corpora have
used small annotation schemas consisting of a
few to several dozen classes for their semantic
annotation, we are employing the full sets of
terms, ranging from approximately one thousand
to several tens of thousands of terms, of select
ontologies of the Open Biomedical Ontologies
(OBO) Consortium, the most prominent set of
biomedical ontologies (Smith et al., 2007), as
well as several other significant large biomedical
controlled terminologies. The terms of these on-
tologies and terminologies, which serve as the
classes of the semantic annotation schema for the
this corpus, are continually under development
by biomedical researchers and knowledge engi-
neers and are widely used throughout the bio-
medical field, as opposed to other annotation
schemas that are often idiosyncratic and not like-
ly reusable for other tasks. Furthermore, though
these ontologies have been used for a variety of
NLP tasks, they have not been used in their en-
tirety toward gold-standard markup of text.
With regard to the CRAFT Corpus project, we
have previously written of desiderata in using
large ontologies and terminologies for semantic
annotation of natural-language documents (Bada
and Hunter, 2009a) and of semantic issues in the
use of one of the ontologies we are using, the
Gene Ontology (Bada and Hunter, 2009b). In
this paper, we present a brief overview of the
concept1 annotation guidelines we are using for
this corpus and the motivations behind our choic-
es. With these guidelines, our annotators have
routinely achieved 90+% agreement with the
project lead on all but the one most challenging
terminological annotation passes, which current-
ly is more than 80%. The guidelines were de-
signed to be reusable regardless of the

minimal exceptions for concept annotation of our
corpus using eight orthogonal large ontologies
and terminologies.
2 Overview of the CRAFT Corpus
The CRAFT Corpus is a collection of 97 full-text
biomedical journal articles that is being richly
annotated both syntactically and semantically
and is designed to be an open community re-
source for the development of advanced bioNLP
systems. The 97 articles of the corpus comprise
the intersection of articles that are open-access
and that have been used as evidential sources for
Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of genes and
gene products of the laboratory mouse by our
collaborators who serve as the official GO cura-
tors of the preeminent mouse database. (The
GO, the flagship OBO, is an ontology composed
of three subontologies representing the specific
molecular functions (MF) of genes and gene
products, the higher-level biological processes
(BP) in which they participate, and the cellular
components (CC) in which they localize (Ash-
burner et al., 2000). GO annotations, which are
entirely different from the annotations we discuss
in the work presented here, are created by label-
ing genes and gene products of organisms with
GO terms.)
These articles in their entirety are being syn-
tactically annotated by sentence segmentation,
tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and tree-
banking. The articles&apos; nouns and noun phrases
are also being coreferentially annotated (Cohen
et al., 2010). Though these branches constitute a
significant amount of the annotations of the
project, they are outside the scope of this paper.
Furthermore, we are working on creating asser-
tional annotations between the concept annota-
tions via relations.
Six ontologies of the OBO library and two ad-
ditional controlled terminologies have thus far
been selected for concept annotation of these ar-
ticles on the bases that these are relatively well-
constructed knowledge representations, are wide-
ly used by bioinformaticians and/or biomedical
researchers, and represent concepts needed to ex-
tract significant biomedical assertions from the
literature. In addition to the three aforemen-
tioned GO ontologies, the OBOs that were se-
lected for concept annotation are the Cell Type
Ontology (CL), which represents types of cells
(Bard et al., 2005); the Chemical Entities of Bio-
logical Interest (ChEBI) ontology, which repre-
sents types of small molecules, parts of mole-
cules, atoms, and subatomic particles (Degt-
yarenko et al., 2008); and the Sequence Ontolo-
gy (SO), which represents types of biological
macromolecules and their components (Eilbeck
et al., 2005). In addition to these ontologies, we
are also annotating the articles with the terms of
the NCBI Taxonomy, the most widely used Lin-
naean hierarchy of biological organisms, and the
unique identifiers of the Entrez Gene database,
the preeminent resource for species-specific
genes (Sayers et al., 2009).
The annotation methodology, not presented
here due to lack of space, has been presented in a
previous publication (Bada and Hunter, 2009a).

3 Overview of the CRAFT Concept An-
notation Guidelines
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98774490625">
Concept annotation entails annotating text with
concepts, i.e., classes or terms from ontologies or
terminologies. (We use this more expansive
term as opposed to named-entity annotation since
several of the terminologies we are using contain
terms representing processes and functions,
which are annotated just as terms representing
entities are.) Every mention (including abbrevia-
tions and misspellings) of every explicitly repre-
sented concept of the ontology or terminology is
annotated, and the text selected must be as se-
mantically close as possible—essentially seman-
tically equivalent—to the term with with which
it is annotated. Thus (as shown later), a mention
of platelets is semantically annotated with a term
representing platelets as opposed to the more
common case of annotating with a more general
term (e.g., representing cells) selected from a
much smaller annotation schema.
For each concept annotation, any selected text
span must be adjacent on each of its boundaries
to an appropriate delimiter. A whitespace char-
acter most often serves as a delimiter:
Ex. 1. localization: :of: :annexin: :A7:
:in: :platelets: :and: :red: :blood: :cells
[PMID:129252382]
(Colons indicate possible boundaries of
annotations.) Any punctuation mark can also
serve as a delimiter indicating a boundary of an
annotation:

cal article from which it is extracted is shown.

Ex. 2. To examine this:,: we analyzed the
ability of red blood cells derived from the
annexin A7 mice :(:anxA7:-:/:-:): to form
exovesicles:.: [PMID:12925238]
Finally, beginnings and ends of documents can
serve as boundaries of annotations.
It is important to note that letters (including
non-Latin letters) and numbers can never serve
as delimiters. Practically, this means that an
annotation text span can never begin or end in
between two letters, between two numbers, or
between a number and a letter. These delimiters
were chosen so that the annotator would not be
burdened with the very difficult and time-
consuming task of having to figure out what
every letter of every abbreviation represented
and whether they should be annotated; similarly,
this avoids evaluation of any arbitrary part of any
word (e.g., whether the &amp;quot;cyto&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;cytological&amp;quot;
should be annotated with the term cell3). This
choice of delimiters sometimes prevents the
annotator from creating an annotation that he or
she may wish to create, but in our experience,
this is a relatively rare occurrence, and it is a
small price to pay for greatly simplifying an
already extremely large and difficult task.
Furthermore, it is a straighforward rule for both
human and computational annotators to follow.
One primary motivation behind our strategy of
annotating only explicitly represented concepts is
the capture of the exact semantics of textual
mentions; conversely, annotating a textual men-
tion with a more general term (e.g., annotating
“platelet” with cell) entails loss of knowledge.
A second motivation is that of making this task
of semantic annotation doable: The alternative of
annotating every mention of the concepts within
the domain of a given terminology including all
concepts within the domain that are not explicitly
represented in the terminology rapidly becomes
an overwhelming task with even a moderately
sized terminology. For example, using this alter-
native strategy to annotate all mentions of ChEBI
chemical concepts explicitly represented or not,
if an annotator came across a mention of a chem-
ical not represented in the ontology, e.g., iodix-
anol, assuming he were not intimately familiar
with the structure and function of iodixanol, he
would have to first research this. From among
the thousands of structural terms, he would have
to annotate this mention with all relevant terms

pertaining to its structure such as amides,
polyols, aromatic compounds, and
organoiodine compounds since this com-
pound contains the corresponding chemical
groups that define these types of molecules (and
none of these terms subsumes another). Further-
more, he would have to evaluate annotating with
all relevant terms from among the hundreds of
ChEBI functional terms (e.g., xenobiotic,
base, chromophore, cofactor). This
enormous amount of work becomes even more
difficult when working with concepts that are not
as precisely defined as, for example, the chemi-
cal structure terms.
Text spans that can be considered for annota-
tion are dictated by syntax, and the text that is se-
lected must be semantically equivalent to a term
in the ontology/terminology. For example, for a
noun, any modifying adjective or prepositional
phrase can be considered for inclusion in the an-
notation if its inclusion results in a semantic
match to a concept in the ontology/terminology.

In Ex. 3, “metabolism” along with its premodify-
ing “fatty-acid” (but not with its premodifying
“whole-body”) are selected for one annotation,
as this is a semantic match to the GO term fat-
ty acid metabolic process. Deter-
miners and quantifiers are never included in con-
cept annotation. Note that this is an example of a
discontinuous annotation—an annotation consist-
ing of two or more discontinuous spans of text,
which is unambiguously represented as standoff.
The use of one or more terminologies in the
semantic markup of text may result in overlap-
ping and nesting annotations. Overlapping refers
to the overlapping of the selected text of an an-
notation, in part or in whole, with the selected
text of another annotation. Nesting is a type of
overlapping in which the selected text of an an-
notation is a proper subset of the selected text of

another another. A nested annotation is created
only if it is to be annotated with a term that is not
a superclass of the term used in the nesting anno-
tation. This is a trivial evaluation if the terms for
the nesting and nested annotations are from dif-
ferent terminologies, as one cannot be a super-
class of the other; if the terms are from the same
terminology, one may or may not be a superclass
of the other. There are no corresponding restric-
tions for overlapping annotations that are not
nesting/nested annotations.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999452631579">
We have succinctly presented our concept-anno-
tation guidelines, with which we routinely
achieve high IAAs in the semantic annotation of
full-text biomedical journal articles. The deci-
sions behind these guidelines were made to max-
imally facilitate both manual and programmatic
annotation of text with the full term sets of termi-
nologies, particularly large ones. Foremost, the
decision to annotate a part of the text with a term
is based on whether this text is a direct semantic
match to an explicitly represented term, and the
specific selection of text is cleanly dictated by
syntactic rules. Additionally, to greatly reduce
the workload of our human annotators, a nested
annotation is created only if the term to be used
is not a superclass of the term used to annotate
the nesting concept mention. These guidelines
were designed to be used with any ontology or
terminology and are available for others to use.

Every mention (including abbreviations and misspellings) of every explicitly represented concept of the ontology or terminology is annotated, and the text selected must be as semantically close </context>

Furthermore, though these ontologies have been used for a variety of NLP tasks, they have not been used in their entirety toward gold-standard markup of text. With regard to the CRAFT Corpus project, we have previously written of desiderata in using large ontologies and terminologies for semantic annotation of natural-language documents (Bada and Hunter, 2009a) and of semantic issues in the use of one of the ontologies we are using, the Gene Ontology (Bada and Hunter, 2009b). In this paper, we present a brief overview of the concept1 annotation guidelines we are using for this corpus and the motivations behind our choices. With these guidelines, our annotators have routinely achieved 90+% agreement with the project lead on all but the one most challenging terminological annotation passes, which currently is more than 80%. The guidelines were designed to be reusable regardless of the 1 Throughout this document, “concept”, “class”, and “term” are us</context>

In addition to the three aforementioned GO ontologies, the OBOs that were selected for concept annotation are the Cell Type Ontology (CL), which represents types of cells (Bard et al., 2005); the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) ontology, which represents types of small molecules, parts of molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles (Degtyarenko et al., 2008); and the Sequence Ontology (SO), which represents types of biological macromolecules and their components (Eilbeck et al., 2005).

GO annotations, which are entirely different from the annotations we discuss in the work presented here, are created by labeling genes and gene products of organisms with GO terms.) These articles in their entirety are being syntactically annotated by sentence segmentation, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and treebanking. The articles&apos; nouns and noun phrases are also being coreferentially annotated (Cohen et al., 2010). Though these branches constitute a significant amount of the annotations of the project, they are outside the scope of this paper. Furthermore, we are working on creating assertional annotations between the concept annotations via relations.
