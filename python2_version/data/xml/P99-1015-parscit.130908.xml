Fourteen indicators that measure the frequency
of lexico-syntactic phenomena linguistically re-
lated to aspectual class are applied to aspec-
tual classification. This group of indicators is
shown to improve classification performance for
two aspectual distinctions, stativity and corn-
pletedness (i.e., telicity), over unrestricted sets
of verbs from two corpora. Several of these in-
dicators have not previously been discovered to
correlate with aspect.

<bodyText confidence="0.999768242424243">
Aspectual classification maps clauses to a small
set of primitive categories in order to reason
about time. For example, events such as,
&amp;quot;You called your father,&amp;quot; are distinguished from
states such as, &amp;quot;You resemble your father.&amp;quot;
These two high-level categories correspond to
primitive distinctions in many domains, e.g., the
distinction between procedure and diagnosis in
the medical domain.
Aspectual classification further distinguishes
events according to completedness (i.e., telicity),
which determines whether an event reaches a
culmination point in time at which a new state
is introduced. For example, &amp;quot;I made a fire&amp;quot;
is culminated, since a new state is introduced
â€” something is made, whereas, &amp;quot;I gazed at the
sunset&amp;quot; is non-culminated.
Aspectual classification is necessary for inter-
preting temporal modifiers and assessing tem-
poral entailments (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979;
Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992), and
is therefore a necessary component for applica-
tions that perform certain natural language in-
terpretation, natural language generation, sum-
marization, information retrieval, and machine
translation tasks.
Aspect introduces a large-scale, domain-
dependent lexical classification problem. Al-
though an aspectual lexicon of verbs would suf-
fice to classify many clauses by their main verb
only, a verb&apos;s primary class is often domain-
dependent (Siegel, 1998b). Therefore, it is nec-
essary to produce a specialized lexicon for each
domain.
Most approaches to automatically catego-
rizing words measure co-occurrences between
open-class lexical items (Schfitze, 1992; Hatzi-
vassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Pereira et
al., 1993). This approach is limited since co-
occurrences between open-class lexical items is
sparse, and is not specialized for particular se-
mantic distinctions such as aspect.
In this paper, we describe an expandable
framework to classify verbs with linguistically-
specialized numerical indicators. Each linguis-
tic indicator measures the frequency of a lexico-
syntactic marker, e.g. the perfect tense. These
markers are linguistically related to aspect, so
the indicators are specialized for aspectual clas-
sification in particular. We perform an evalua-
tion of fourteen linguistic indicators over unre-
stricted sets of verbs from two corpora. When
used in combination, this group of indicators is
shown to improve classification performance for
two aspectual distinctions: stativity and com-
pletedness. Moreover, our analysis reveals a
predictive value for several indicators that have
not previously been discovered to correlate with
aspect in the linguistics literature.
The following section further describes as-
pect, and introduces linguistic insights that are
exploited by linguistic indicators. The next sec-
tion describes the set of linguistic indicators
evaluated in this paper. Then, our experimen-
tal method and results are given, followed by a
discussion and conclusions.

Table 1 summarizes the three aspectual distinc-
tions, which compose five aspectual categories.
In addition to the two distinctions described
in the previous section, atomicity distinguishes
events according to whether they have a time
duration (punctual versus extended). Therefore,
four classes of events are derived: culmination,
culminated process, process, and point. These
aspectual distinctions are defined formally by
Dowty (1979).
Several researchers have developed models
that incorporate aspectual class to assess tem-
poral constraints between clauses (Passonneau,
1988; Dorr, 1992). For example, stativity must
be identified to detect temporal constraints be-
tween clauses connected with when, e.g., in in-
terpreting (1),

<bodyText confidence="0.948068">
These aspectual distinctions are motivated by
a series of entailment constraints. In particu-
lar, certain lexico-syntactic features of a clause,
such as temporal adjuncts and tense, are con-
strained by and contribute to the aspectual class
of the clause (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979).

The best way to exploit aspectual markers is not
obvious, since, while the presence of a marker in
a particular clause indicates a constraint on the
aspectual class of the clause, the absence thereof
does not place any constraint. Therefore, as
with most statistical methods for natural lan-
guage, the linguistic constraints associated with
markers are best exploited by a system that
measures co-occurrence frequencies. For exam-
ple, a verb that appears more frequently in the
progressive is more likely to describe an event.
Klavans and Chodorow (1992) pioneered the ap-
plication of statistical corpus analysis to aspec-
tual classification by ranking verbs according to
the frequencies with which they occur with cer-
tain aspectual markers.

ated for aspectual classification. Each indica-

tor has a unique value for each verb. The first
indicator, frequency, is simply the frequency
with which each verb occurs over the entire
corpus. The remaining 13 indicators measure
how frequently each verb occurs in a clause
with the named linguistic marker. For exam-
ple, the next three indicators listed measure the
frequency with which verbs 1) are modified by
not or never, 2) are modified by a temporal ad-
verb such as then or frequently, and 3) have no
deep subject (e.g., passive phrases such as, &amp;quot;She
was admitted to the hospital&amp;quot;). Further details
regarding these indicators and their linguistic
motivation is given by Siegel (1998b).
There are several reasons to expect superior
classification performance when employing mul-
tiple linguistic indicators in combination rather
than using them individually. While individ-
ual indicators have predictive value, they are
predictively incomplete. This incompleteness
has been illustrated empirically by showing that
some indicators help for only a subset of verbs
(Siegel, 1998b). Such incompleteness is due in
part to sparsity and noise of data when com-
puting indicator values over a corpus with lim-
ited size and some parsing errors. However, this
incompleteness is also a consequence of the lin-
guistic characteristics of various indicators. For
example:

sive in, &amp;quot;She was sneezing for a week.&amp;quot;
(point process culminated process)
In this example, for a week can only modify
an extended event, requiring the first coer-
cion. In addition, this for-PP also makes
an event culminated, causing the second
transformation.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9984084">
â€¢ Some aspectual markers such as the
pseudo-cleft and manner adverbs test for
intentional events, and therefore are not
compatible with all events, e.g., &apos;4/ died
diligently.&amp;quot;
â€¢ The progressive indicator&apos;s predictiveness
for stativity is compromised by the fact
that many location verbs can appear with
the progressive, even in their stative sense,
e.g. &amp;quot;The book was lying on the shelf.&amp;quot;
(Dowty, 1979)
â€¢ Several indicators measure phenomena
that are not linguistically constrained by
any aspectual category, e.g., the present
tense, frequency and not/never indicators.

4 Method and Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99949352">
In this section, we evaluate the set of
fourteen linguistic indicators for two aspec-
tual distinctions: stativity and completed-
ness. Evaluation is over corpora of med-
ical reports and novels, respectively. This
data is summarized in Table 4 (available at
www. cs . co lumbia.edui-evs/VerbDat a).
First, linguistic indicators are each evalu-
ated individually. A training set is used to se-
lect indicator value thresholds for classification.
Then, we report the classification performance
achieved by combining multiple indicators. In
this case, the training set is used to optimize a
model for combining indicators. In both cases,
evaluation is performed over a separate test set
of clauses.
The combination of indicators is performed
by four standard supervised learning algo-
rithms: decision tree induction (Quinlan, 1986),
CART (Friedman, 1977), log-linear regression
(Santner and Duffy, 1989) and genetic program-
ming (GP) (Cramer, 1985; Koza, 1992).

ment in accuracy or recall tradeoff by additional

Our experiments are performed across a cor-
pus of 3,224 medical discharge summaries. A
medical discharge summary describes the symp-
toms, history, diagnosis, treatment and outcome
of a patient&apos;s visit to the hospital. These re-
ports were parsed with the English Slot Gram-
mar (ESG) (McCord, 1990), resulting in 97,973
clauses that were parsed fully with no self-
diagnostic errors (ESO produced error messages
on 12,877 of this corpus&apos; 51,079 complex sen-
tences).
Be and have, the two most popular verbs, cov-
ering 31.9% of the clauses in this corpus, are
handled separately from all other verbs. Clauses
with be as their main verb, comprising 23.9% of
the corpus, always denote a state. Clauses with
have as their main verb, composing 8.0% of the
corpus, are highly ambiguous, and have been
addressed separately by considering the direct
object of such clauses (Siegel, 1998a).

83.8% of clauses with main verbs other than
be and have are events, which thus provides a

our approach examines only the main verb of a

The values of the indicators listed in Table 5
were computed, for each verb, across the 97,973
parsed clauses from our corpus of medical dis-
charge summaries.
The second and third columns of Table 5 show
the average value for each indicator over stative
and event clauses, as measured over the training
examples. For example, 4.44% of stative clauses
are modified by either not or never, but only
1.56% of event clauses were so modified.
The fourth column shows the results of T-
tests that compare indicator values over stative
training cases to those over event cases for each

4.1.3 Indicators in Combination
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993725">
Three machine learning methods successfully
combined indicator values, improving classifi-
cation accuracy over the baseline measure. As
shown in Table 6, the decision tree attained the
highest accuracy, 93.9%. Binomial tests showed
this to be a significant improvement over the
88.0% accuracy achieved by the frequency indi-
cator alone, as well as over the other two learn-
ing methods. No further improvement in classi-
fication performance was achieved by CART.
The increase in the number of stative clauses
correctly classified, i.e. stative recall, illustrates
an even greater improvement over the base-
line. As shown in Table 6, the three learn-
ing methods achieved stative recalls of 74.2%,
47.4% and 34.2%, as compared to the 0.0% sta-
tive recall achieved by the baseline, while only
a small loss in recall over event clauses was suf-
fered. The baseline does not classify any stative
clauses correctly because it classifies all clauses
as events.
Classification performance is equally compet-
itive without the frequency indicator, although
this indicator appears to dominate over oth-
ers. When decision tree induction was employed
to combine only the 13 indicators other than
frequency, the resulting decision tree achieved
92.4% accuracy and 77.5% stative recall.

In medical discharge summaries, non-

our experiments for classification according to
completedness are performed across a corpus

novels were parsed with ESC, resulting in
75,289 fully-parsed clauses (22,505 of 59,816
sentences produced errors).

4.2.1 Manual Marking
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954566666667">
884 clauses from the parsed corpus were man-
ually marked according to completedness. Of
these, 109 were rejected because of parsing
problems, and 160 rejected because they de-
scribed states. The remaining 615 clauses were
divided into training and test sets such that the
distribution of classes was equal. The baseline
method in this case achieves 63.3% accuracy.
The linguistic test was selected for this task
by Passonneau (1988): If a clause in the past
progressive necessarily entails the past tense
reading, the clause describes a non-culminated
event. For example, We were talking just like
men (non-culm.) entails that We talked just
like men, but The woman was building a house
(culm.) does not necessarily entail that The
woman built a house. Cross-checking between
linguists shows high agreement. In particular,
in a pilot study manually annotating 89 clauses
from this corpus according to stativity, two lin-
guists agreed 81 times. Of 57 clauses agreed
to be events, 46 had agreement with respect to
completedness.
The verb say (point), which occurs nine times
in the test set, was initially marked incorrectly
as culminated, since points are non-extended
and therefore cannot be placed in the progres-
sive. After some initial experimentation, we cor-
rected the class of each occurrence of say in the
data.

log-linear regression ranked the perfect indica-
tor as fourth out of fourteen, function trees cre-
ated by GP include the perfect indicator as one
of five indicators used together to increase clas-
sification performance, and the perfect indicator
tied as most highly correlated with completed-
ness (cf. Table 7).

Since certain verbs are aspectually ambiguous,
and, in this work, clauses are classified by their
main verb only, a second baseline approach
would be to simply memorize the majority as-
pect of each verb in the training set, and classify
verbs in the test set accordingly. In this case,
test verbs that did not appear in the training set
would be classified according to majority class.
However, classifying verbs and clauses accord-
ing to numerical indicators has several impor-
tant advantages over this baseline:

results we have shown serve to estimate
classification performance over &amp;quot;unseen&amp;quot;
verbs that were not included in the super-
vised training sample. Once the system
has been trained to distinguish by indi-
cator values, it can automatically classify
any verb that appears in unlabeled cor-
pora, since measuring linguistic indicators
for a verb is fully automatic. This also ap-
plies to verbs that are underrepresented in
the training set. For example, one node
of the resulting decision tree trained to
distinguish according to stativity identifies
19 stative test cases without misclassifying
any of 27 event test cases with verbs that
occur only one time each in the training
set.

were eliminated from the training set, and
log-linear regression was trained over this
smaller set to distinguish according to com-
pletedness. The result is shown in Table 8

a recall tradeff for both stativity and corn-
pletedness. These results are indicated as
the second baselines (&amp;quot;b12&amp;quot;) in tables 6 and
8, respectively.
â€¢ Scalar values assigned to each verb al-
low the tradeoff between recall and preci-
sion to be selected for particular applica-
tions by selecting the classification thresh-
old. For example, in a separate study, op-
timizing for F-measure resulted in a more
dramatic tradeoff in recall values as com-
pared to those attained when optimizing
for accuracy (Siegel, 1998b). Moreover,
such scalar values can provide input to sys-
tems that perform reasoning on fuzzy or
uncertainty knowledge.
â€¢ This framework is expandable since
additional indicators can be introduced
by measuring the frequencies of additional
aspectual markers. Furthermore, indica-
tors measured over multiple clausal con-
stituents, e.g., main verb-object pairs, al-
leviate verb ambiguity and sparsity and
improve classification performance (Siegel,
1998b).

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999491671232877">
We have developed a full-scale system for aspec-
tual classification with multiple linguistic indi-
cators. Once trained, this system can automati-
cally classify all verbs appearing in a corpus, in-
cluding &amp;quot;unseen&amp;quot; verbs that were not included
in the supervised training sample. This frame-
work is expandable, since additional lexico-
syntactic markers may also correlate with as-
pectual class. Future work will extend this ap-
proach to other semantic distinctions in natural
language.
Linguistic indicators successfully exploit lin-
guistic insights to provide a much-needed
method for aspectual classification. When com-
bined with a decision tree to classify according
to stativity, the indicators achieve an accuracy
of 93.9% and stative recall of 74.2%. When com-
bined with CART to classify according to corn-
pletedness, indicators achieved 74.0% accuracy
and 53.1% non-culminated recall.
A favorable tradeoff in recall presents an ad-
vantage for applications that weigh the identi-
fication of non-dominant classes more heavily
(Cardie and Howe, 1997). For example, cor-
rectly identifying occurrences of for that denote
event durations relies on positively identifying
non-culminated events. A system that summa-
rizes the duration of events which incorrectly
classifies &amp;quot;She ran (for a minute)&amp;quot; as culmi-
nated will not detect that &amp;quot;for a minute&amp;quot; de-
scribes the duration of the run event. This is be-
cause durative for-PPs that modify culminated
events denote the duration of the ensuing state,
e.g., I left the room for a minute. (Vendler,
1967)
Our analysis has revealed several insights re-
garding individual indicators. For example,
both duration in-PP and manner adverb are
particularly valuable for multiple aspectual dis-
tinctions â€” they were ranked in the top two po-
sitions by log-linear modeling for both stativity
and completedness.
We have discovered several new linguistic in-
dicators that are not traditionally linked to as-
pectual class. In particular, verb frequency with
no deep subject was positively correlated with
both stativity and completedness. Moreover,
four other indicators are newly linked to stativ-
ity: (1) Verb frequency, (2) occurrences modi-
fied by &amp;quot;not&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;never&amp;quot;, (3) occurrences in the
past or present participle, and (4) occurrences
in the perfect tense. Additionally, another three
were newly linked to completedness: (1) occur-
rences modified by a manner adverb, (2) occur-
rences in the past or present participle, and (3)
occurrences in the progressive.
These new correlations can be understood in
pragmatic terms. For example, since points
(non-culminated, punctual events, e.g., hiccup)
are rare, punctual events are likely to be cul-
minated. Therefore, an indicator that discrim-
inates events according to extendedness, e.g.,
the progressive, past/present participle, and du-
ration for-PP, is likely to also discriminate be-
tween culminated and non-culminated events.
As a second example, the not/never indica-
tor correlates with stativity in medical reports
because diagnoses (i.e., states) are often ruled
out in medical discharge summaries, e.g., &amp;quot;The
patient was not hypertensive,&amp;quot; but procedures
(i.e., events) that were not done are not usu-
ally mentioned, e.g., &apos;?An examination was not
performed.&amp;quot;

For example, stativity must be identified to detect temporal constraints between clauses connected with when, e.g., in interpreting (1), (1) She had good strength when objectively tested. the following temporal relationship holds: have test However, in interpreting (2), (2) Phototherapy was discontinued when the bilirubin came down to 13. the temporal relationship is different: come discontinue These aspectual distinctions are motivated by </context>

Therefore, as with most statistical methods for natural language, the linguistic constraints associated with markers are best exploited by a system that measures co-occurrence frequencies. For example, a verb that appears more frequently in the progressive is more likely to describe an event. Klavans and Chodorow (1992) pioneered the application of statistical corpus analysis to aspectual classification by ranking verbs according to the frequencies with which they occur with certain aspectual markers.

Aspectual classification further distinguishes events according to completedness (i.e., telicity), which determines whether an event reaches a culmination point in time at which a new state is introduced. For example, &amp;quot;I made a fire&amp;quot; is culminated, since a new state is introduced â€” something is made, whereas, &amp;quot;I gazed at the sunset&amp;quot; is non-culminated. Aspectual classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal entailments (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992), and is therefore a necessary component for applications that perform certain natural language interpretation, natural language generation, summarization, information retrieval, and machine translation tasks.

The following section further describes aspect, and introduces linguistic insights that are exploited by linguistic indicators.

While individual indicators have predictive value, they are predictively incomplete. This incompleteness has been illustrated empirically by showing that some indicators help for only a subset of verbs (Siegel, 1998b). Such incompleteness is due in part to sparsity and noise of data when computing indicator values over a corpus with limited size and some parsing errors. However, this incompleteness is also a consequence of the linguistic characteristics of various indicators. For example: â€¢ Aspectual coercion such as iteration compromises indicator measurements (Moens and Steedman, 1988). For example, a punctual event appears with the progressive in, &amp;quot;She was sneezing for a week.&amp;quot; (point process culminated process) In this example, for a week can only modify an extended event, requiring the first coercion.

These novels were parsed with ESC, resulting in 75,289 fully-parsed clauses (22,505 of 59,816 sentences produced errors). 4.2.1 Manual Marking 884 clauses from the parsed corpus were manually marked according to completedness. Of these, 109 were rejected because of parsing problems, and 160 rejected because they described states. The remaining 615 clauses were divided into training and test sets such that the distribution of classes was equal. The baseline method in this case achieves 63.3% accuracy. The linguistic test was selected for this task by Passonneau (1988): If a clause in the past progressive necessarily entails the past tense reading, the clause describes a non-culminated event. For example, We were talking just like men (non-culm.) entails that We talked just like men, but The woman was building a house (culm.) does not necessarily entail that The woman built a house. Cross-checking between linguists shows high agreement. In particular, in a pilot study manually annotating 89 clauses from this corpus according to stativity, two linguists agreed 81 times.

Aspect introduces a large-scale, domaindependent lexical classification problem. Although an aspectual lexicon of verbs would suffice to classify many clauses by their main verb only, a verb&apos;s primary class is often domaindependent (Siegel, 1998b). Therefore, it is necessary to produce a specialized lexicon for each domain. Most approaches to automatically categorizing words measure co-occurrences between open-class lexical items (Schfitze, 1992; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Pereira et al., 1993).

The first indicator, frequency, is simply the frequency with which each verb occurs over the entire corpus. The remaining 13 indicators measure how frequently each verb occurs in a clause with the named linguistic marker. For example, the next three indicators listed measure the frequency with which verbs 1) are modified by not or never, 2) are modified by a temporal adverb such as then or frequently, and 3) have no deep subject (e.g., passive phrases such as, &amp;quot;She was admitted to the hospital&amp;quot;). Further details regarding these indicators and their linguistic motivation is given by Siegel (1998b). There are several reasons to expect superior classification performance when employing multiple linguistic indicators in combination rather than using them individually. While individual indicators have predictive value, they are predictively incomplete. This incompleteness has been illustrated empirically by showing that some indicators help for only a subset of verbs (Siegel, 1998b). Such incompleteness is due in part to sparsity and noise of data when computing indicator values over a corpus with limited size and some parsing errors.

Aspectual classification further distinguishes events according to completedness (i.e., telicity), which determines whether an event reaches a culmination point in time at which a new state is introduced. For example, &amp;quot;I made a fire&amp;quot; is culminated, since a new state is introduced â€” something is made, whereas, &amp;quot;I gazed at the sunset&amp;quot; is non-culminated. Aspectual classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal entailments (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992), and is therefore a necessary component for applications that perform certain natural language interpretation, natural language generation, summarization, information retrieval, and machine translation tasks.

In particular, certain lexico-syntactic features of a clause, such as temporal adjuncts and tense, are constrained by and contribute to the aspectual class of the clause (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979).

For example, correctly identifying occurrences of for that denote event durations relies on positively identifying non-culminated events. A system that summarizes the duration of events which incorrectly classifies &amp;quot;She ran (for a minute)&amp;quot; as culminated will not detect that &amp;quot;for a minute&amp;quot; describes the duration of the run event. This is because durative for-PPs that modify culminated events denote the duration of the ensuing state, e.g., I left the room for a minute. (Vendler, 1967) Our analysis has revealed several insights regarding individual indicators. For example, both duration in-PP and manner adverb are particularly valuable for multiple aspectual distinctions â€” they were ranked in the top two positions by log-linear modeling for both stativity and completedness. We have discovered several new linguistic indicators that are not traditionally linked to aspectual class. In particular, verb frequency with no deep subject was positively correlated with both stativity and completedness. Moreover, four other indicators are newly linked to stativity: (1) Verb frequency,</context>
