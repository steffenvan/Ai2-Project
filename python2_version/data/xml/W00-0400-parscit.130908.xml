PREFACE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999700904761905">
Automatic summarization aims at producing a concise, condensed representation of the key
information content in an information source for a particular user and task. Interest in automatic
summarization continues to grow, motivated by the explosion of on-line information sources and
advances in natural language processing and information retrieval. In fact, some form of automatic
summarization may be indispensable given the massive information universes that lie ahead in the 21st
century.
The problem of automatic summarization poses a variety of tough challenges in both NL
understanding and generation. A spate of recent papers and tutorials on this subject at conferences such
as ACL/EACL, AAAI, ECAI, IJCAI, and SIGIR point to a growing interest in research in this field.
Several commercial summarization products have, also appeared. There have been several workshops
in the past on this subject: in Dagstuhl (1994), Madrid (1997), and Stanford (1998). It is our great
pleasure to bring the fourth such event to you.
While the field continues to progress, there are also many problems that need to be addressed before
the promises of automatic text summarization can be fully realized. The papers included in this volume
present a snapshot of recent progress in solving some of the problems: concept identification,
identification of discourse markers, multi-document summarization, content visualization, evaluation,
and use. Out of 29 submissions to the workshop, 10 are included in these proceedings.
We would like to thank all authors for their hard work. This workshop would not be possible without
them. We would also like to thank the program committee and all the reviewers for their valuable
feedback. In addition, we are grateful to the ACL for sponsoring the workshop and to the MITRE
Corporation for supporting the publication of the proceedings.
