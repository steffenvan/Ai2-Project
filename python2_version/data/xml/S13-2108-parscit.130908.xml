The DDIExtraction 2013 task in the SemEval
conference concerns the detection of drug
names and statements of drug-drug interac-
tions (DDI) from text. Extraction of DDIs
is important for providing up-to-date knowl-
edge on adverse interactions between co-
administered drugs. We apply the machine
learning based Turku Event Extraction Sys-
tem to both tasks. We evaluate three fea-
ture sets, syntactic features derived from deep
parsing, enhanced optionally with features de-
rived from DrugBank or from both DrugBank
and MetaMap. TEES achieves F-scores of
60% for the drug name recognition task and
59% for the DDI extraction task.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887673469388">
Drug-drug interactions (DDI) refer to one drug af-
fecting the function of another when they are co-
administered. These interactions are often adverse,
frequently not well known and a source of poten-
tially life-threatening unintended consequences for
the patients. Databases such as DrugBank and Mi-
cromedex have been developed to store informa-
tion about known DDIs, but at present their cover-
age remains limited and there can be inconsistencies
in supplementary information (Knox et al., 2011;
Wong et al., 2008). Text mining has been proposed
as a solution for providing not only lists of DDIs
but also a connection to the scientific evidence and
supplementary information in the literature (Tari et
al., 2010). Several groups of researchers are devel-
oping text-mining techniques to extract DDIs from
literature and pharmaceutical documents (Tari et al.,
2010; Segura-Bedmar et al., 2011a).
The DDIExtraction 2013 shared task concerns the
detection of drug mentions and statements of DDIs
from unannotated text (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2013).
The first version of the DDIExtraction shared task
was organized in 2011, with 10 teams participat-
ing from various universities (Segura-Bedmar et al.,
2011b). The best result of 65.74% was achieved
by team WBI of Humboldt University of Berlin
(Thomas et al., 2011). University of Turku partic-
ipated also in this task, placing 4th with an F-score
of 62.99%, using the Turku Event Extraction System
(Bj¨orne et al., 2011).
The Turku Event Extraction System (TEES)1 is
an open source program for extracting events and re-
lations from biomedical texts. It was originally de-
veloped for extracting events in the BioNLP Shared
Task scheme, and it models event extraction as a
graph generation task, where keywords are nodes
and the event arguments connecting them are edges.
The system can be directly applied to pairwise re-
lation extraction, representing relations as edges and
the words they connect as nodes. The node detection
system is somewhat similar to named entity recog-
nition (NER) tools, and while quite flexible, can in
many tasks exhibit lower performance and higher
processing requirements than dedicated NER sys-
tems.
In the DDIExtraction 2013 task we apply the
Turku Event Extraction system to detecting both
drug name entities (task 9.1) as well as drug-drug
interactions (task 9.2). We evaluate three different

feature sets for both tasks. As a baseline system deep
syntactic parsing is used to generate large graph-
based feature sets. For additional features, we test
the impact of labeling examples with information
from external sources. We test both the DrugBank
Open Data Drug &amp; Drug Target database (Knox et
al., 2011) as well as the MetaMap tool to enrich the
features derived from the corpus text.
MetaMap is a publicly available program devel-
oped at NLM for automatic mapping of texts to
UMLS Metathesaurus concepts (Aronson, 2001).
The UMLS Metathesaurus is an extensive reposi-
tory of biomedical vocabularies that is derived from
NLM databases and other external sources that con-
tain information about biomedical concepts, syn-
onyms and the relationship among them (Bodenrei-
der, 2004).
The version of TEES used in the 2011 DDIEx-
traction task had been publicly available as an open
source project since July 2012, but as small mod-
ifications were required for compatibility with the
2013 task, we published an updated 2.1 version that
task participants could use. To simplify utilization of
the numerous analyses TEES produces we also pro-
vided our drug-drug interaction predictions freely
available for all DDIExtraction 2013 task partici-
pants in the hope of encouraging further participa-
tion in this interesting shared task.
We demonstrate that TEES has good performance
for both drug name detection as well as drug-drug
interaction detection, achieving an F-score of 60%
in the drug name detection task 9.1 and an F-score of
59% in the drug-drug interaction detection task 9.2.
We show that external information from DrugBank
and MetaMap can considerably improve extraction
performance, but observe that the use of such in-
formation must always depend on the exact require-
ments of each text mining task.

We present a unified approach to drug name and

2.1 Turku Event Extraction System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981636363636">
The Turku Event Extraction System is described in
detail in Bj¨orne et al. (2012). Here we give a gen-
eral overview about applying the system for the cur-
rent task. TEES processes text in a pipeline of com-
ponents, starting from preprocessing tasks such as
NER and parsing and proceeding to the multiple,
consecutive steps of event extraction. As tasks 9.1
and 9.2 are independent of each other the entity and
interaction detection components of TEES are used
independently, and for preprocessing, only the pars-
ing is done (See Figure 1).

2.2 Training data preparation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960848484848">
TEES is a machine learning system based on sup-
port vector machines (SVM) (Tsochantaridis et al.,
2005). To train the system for a new task, two
datasets are required: a training set on which the
SVM model is trained, and a development set on
which the newly trained model is tested to deter-
mine parameter settings for optimal performance
(See Figure 2). The optimal model can then be
used to detect what it was trained for on unannotated
datasets, such as the hidden shared task test set.
The DDIExtraction 2013 corpus consists of two
parts: A training corpus used for system develop-
ment and a test corpus for evaluating the participat-
ing systems. The annotation of the test corpus is not
revealed to task participants. To develop the system,
we estimate performance on the training corpus us-
ing 10-fold cross validation. To provide the datasets
TEES requires, the training corpus is randomly di-
vided (on the document level) into ten parts. For
predicting drug names or DDIs for each part, seven
of the remaining nine parts are used as a training
set and two as a development set for parameter opti-
mization. When producing the final models for clas-
sifying the test corpus, five parts of the training cor-
pus are used for training and the other five for pa-
rameter optimization. In both cases, the parameter
optimization set is merged with the training set when
producing the final model for classifying the test set.
The DDIExtraction 2013 corpus is provided in an
XML format originally introduced as a unified for-
mat for several pairwise protein-protein interaction
(PPI) corpora (Pyysalo et al., 2008). TEES uses a
variant of this format as its internal data representa-

tion. While close to the DDIExtraction 2013 format,
some differences exist, so we preprocess the corpora
for compatibility with TEES. Namely, ddi elements
are renamed as interaction elements, entity elements
in task 9.2 are tagged with the given attribute to mark
them as pre-annotated data for TEES and all charac-
ter offsets are converted to the TEES format by in-
creasing the end offset by one, resulting in spans de-
noted with the beginning character and end charac-
ter plus one, a common convention in programming
languages such as Java and Python.
Before use, all DDIExtraction 2013 corpora are
parsed with the TEES preprocessing pipeline, using
the BLLIP parser with David McClosky’s biomodel
to produce a Penn-tree style parse which is con-
verted with the Stanford parser tools to the collapsed
CC processed Stanford dependency scheme (Char-
niak and Johnson, 2005; McClosky, 2010; de Marn-
effe et al., 2006).

2.3 Drug name recognition with TEES
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965785714286">
For drug name recognition the TEES entity detector
module is used. Baseline syntactic features (model
1) are generated from the parse, using both informa-
tion on the tokens and their linear context, as well
as dependency chains starting from the entity head
token. External data is added to the head token fea-
tures, from where it is combined into more complex
features. One example is generated for each token in
the sentence, and these are classified into negatives
or one of the positive classes.
As a new feature we generate all substrings start-
ing from the first and last characters of the drug
name, with the intention of detecting common pre-
fixes and suffixes among the drug names.

2.4 Drug-drug interaction detection with TEES
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957882352941">
For DDI extraction we use the TEES edge detec-
tor module. DDIs are typed, undirected edges, so
one example is generated for each undirected pair of
drug name entities present in the sentence (See Fig-
ure 1). The baseline syntactic features (model 1) are
generated mostly from the shortest path of depen-
dencies connecting the pair of drug name entities’
head tokens. From this shortest path several feature
groups are generated, including N-grams of various
lengths, governor–dependent information for depen-
dencies etc. External data is added into the two drug
name entities, and combined into the path features.
We also use the TEES modification from DDIEx-
traction 2011 task where conj and dependencies are
ignored when calculating the shortest path, with the
aim of including more of the relevant interaction
words in the path.

2.5 Using DrugBank for Domain Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999812857142857">
DrugBank2 is a public database of information on
drugs and drug targets. We use the downloadable
XML version of the database.
For drug name recognition, for each candidate to-
ken, we add as features its presence as a known
drug name in DrugBank and the synonym, brand,
group and category annotations this drug may have.
We also mark whether the candidate token exactly
equals an annotation of one of these types, indicating
cases where the token is e.g. a known brand name.
For DDI extraction, we mark as a feature whether
the drug name pair is listed in DrugBank as having
interactions or not. We also mark if one of the drug
names is not listed in DrugBank.

2.6 Using MetaMap for Domain Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970090909091">
The MetaMap program has been used extensively
for a wide array of BioNLP studies, such as auto-
matic indexing of biomedical literature and concept-
based text summarization (Reeve et al., 2007;
Quanzhi and Yi-Fang Brook, 2006). For drug-
related information extraction, two recent applica-
tions demonstrated that integrating the MetaMap
program to their existing systems produces high
overall performance in i.) identification and clas-
sification of the pharmaceutical substances and ii.)
extraction of drug indication information (Segura-
Bedmar et al., 2008; Fung et al., 2013).
MetaMap finds Metathesaurus concepts by per-
forming a shallow syntactic analysis of the input
text, producing a set of noun phrases. The noun
phrases are then used to generate sets of variants
which are consequently looked up from the Metathe-
saurus concepts. Matching concepts are evaluated
against the original text and the strength of the map-
pings are calculated. The candidates are finally
combined and the final scores are computed, where
the highest score of a complete mapping represents

MetaMap’s interpretation of the text.
The MetaMap program can be run both lo-
cally and remotely3. We ran the current version,
MetaMap2012, remotely via the batch mode facil-
ity by converting the sentences of the DDIExtrac-
tion corpora into the MetaMap input format. Many
of the applications that integrate MetaMap into their
systems use the default settings that are claimed to
be suitable for general purposes. However, we ap-
plied different options with the aim of increasing
the coverage of Metathesaurus concepts found by
MetaMap. The parameter set that influences the
performance of MetaMap included; using a relaxed
model, selecting the NLM2012AB Metathesaurus
version, including all derivational variants, enabling
unique acronym/abbreviation variants only, allow-
ing candidates from one or two character words, pre-
ferring multiple concepts and using word sense dis-
ambiguation.
The Relaxed Model is provided by MetaMap in
addition to the strict model which is offered as a
default setting in which all types of filterings are
applied. However, we chose the relaxed model in
which only manual and lexical filterings are used.
While the strict model is most appropriate for exper-
iments that require the highest accuracy, it covers
only 53% of the Metathesaurus strings. As we con-
sider high coverage of concepts an important factor,
we applied the relaxed model which consists of up
to 83% of Metathesaurus strings.
The versions of Metathesaurus, Base, USAbase
and NLM, provided with MetaMap are different
in their Metathesaurus coverage and the license
type required for using vocabulary sources. The
NLM2012AB version which is offered at no cost
for research purposes and covers all of the provided
Metathesaurus was used in our work.
Variants, such as inflectional and derivational
variants, are computed by MetaMap to account for
the textual variation in the text. With this setting,
many types of variants are generated recursively, and
only acronyms and abbreviations are restricted to the
unique ones. In addition, the candidates also include
words that can be prepositions, conjunctions or de-
terminers if they occur often enough in Metathe-
saurus.

Prefer multiple concepts causes MetaMap to
score the mappings with more concepts higher than
those with fewer concepts. This option is useful for
discovering higher-order relationships among con-
cepts found in the text and as such is assumed to be
helpful for discovering the DDIs.
Word sense disambiguation attempts to solve lex-
ical ambiguities by identifying the correct meaning
of a word based on its context. By using this option
in MetaMap, the program attempts to solve the am-
biguities among equally scoring concepts by choos-
ing the concept(s) based on semantic type.
We use the XML version of the MetaMap out-
put which is post-processed by TEES to extract rel-
evant features; candidate concepts, preferred con-
cepts, CUI (Concepts Unique Identifier), score, se-
mantic types and sources.
For drug name recognition, these are added as bi-
nary features for the candidate token, with the ex-
ception of the score, the value of which is normal-
ized into the [0, 1] range. For DDI extraction, the
binary features are added for the two drug names,
and combined into the shortest path features.

The TEES 2.0 system used in DDIExtraction 2011
Shared Task has been public since summer 2012.
While only small modifications are needed to make
the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus usable with the
TEES system, these can be complicated for new
users. Therefore, to make sure our public DDIEx-
traction 2011 system is usable not only in theory,
but easy enough to use in practice, we updated the
system into the 2.1 version capable of automatically

3 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971130434783">
Three feature sets were used to produce the results.
The baseline set (model 1) consisted of the TEES
entity and edge detectors which build a large feature
set from syntactic parses. Model 2 adds DrugBank
features to this baseline and model 3 further extends
model 2 with MetaMap information.
Three runs using these models were submitted for
both tasks 9.1 and 9.2. The results indicate the sys-
tem was capable of detecting both drug names and
drug-drug interactions with reasonable performance.
The best F-scores were 60% for task 9.1 drug name
detection and 59% for task 9.2 DDI extraction.
As task 9.1 is completely new, and task 9.2 was
extended from the 2011 DDI extraction task with
typed interactions and MEDLINE abstracts, the cur-
rent results are not directly comparable with the
2011 ones. The evaluation metric closest to the 2011
task is task 9.2 DDI detection regardless of type, us-
ing only the DrugBank subset of the corpus. With
this metric, our system achieved an F-score of 72%
in 2013 vs. 62.99% in 2011, which may indicate
higher baseline performance, potentially influenced
by a larger training dataset.

3.1 Drug name recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975396551725">
The decision to not attempt detection of more than
one token per drug entity proved to be not too detri-
mental to the final performance. In the training cor-
pus, there are 14,765 drug name entities of which
only 2,768 (18.7%) consist of more than one to-
ken, and of these only 38 are disjoint (not form-
ing a continuous span). For our best performing
drug name detection model (number 3) typed, par-
tial span matching was at 78% F-score vs. typed,
strict span matching at 65%. Therefore, detecting
only a single token per entity resulted in a maximum
loss of 13 percentage points (pp), but considering
that a scheme designed to detect multi-token entities
would be inherently more complex, potentially hav-
ing lower performance, and that not all of the spans
would be correctly detected, we feel this tradeoff in
performance is worth it for the considerably more
simple system design it allows.
Adding the external datasets to the classifier mod-
els proved to have a considerable impact on the task
performance (See Table 1). The baseline system
reached an F-score of 47% which was increased by
9 percentage points when including DrugBank infor-
mation and a further 4 percentage points when also
MetaMap information was included.
As seen from the type-specific F-scores (on the
training corpus), brand class entity detection was
improved by 30 pp when DrugBank information was
added, and increased slightly further with MetaMap
information (See Table 2). DrugBank lists brand
names for many drugs, and when this information
is added as a feature for each detected drug, deter-
mining the type of the drug is greatly improved.
The official primary metric in both tasks 9.1 and
9.2 is a macro-averaged F-score, which gives equal
weight to performance in each class, emphasizing
the importance of detecting also the difficult, small
classes. In particular, the class drug n (active sub-
stances not approved for use in humans for medical
purposes) was very difficult to detect for our system.
While performance remained low for all three mod-
els, including the MetaMap information gave a large
relative increase in drug n detection performance,
increasing it from 2% F-score to 8% (See Table 2).
With the macro-averaged overall performance, this
resulted in model three with the MetaMap informa-
tion having notably higher performance.
We hypothesized that the drug n category might
be hard to detect as it could contain entities simi-
lar to the drug category, which may differ only by
approval for use in humans, information that is not
likely present in the corpus. Analysis of classifi-
cation errors (See Table 3) confirms this hypothe-
sis, showing that drug n entities are by far the most
commonly misclassified ones. Addition of Drug-
Bank and MetaMap information considerably re-
duces drug n misclassifications into the drug cate-
gory.

both DrugBank and MetaMap features.
Task rules allowed using the test corpus of task
9.2 (with annotated entities) as additional training
data for task 9.1. Due to time constraints we did not
use it for training, but it is likely that performance
could be further enhanced by using it.

3.2 Drug-drug interaction extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987904761905">
Performance of the three feature sets in the 9.2 DDI
extraction task are much closer than in the 9.1 drug
name recognition task. Still, additional informa-
tion from DrugBank and MetaMap slightly increase
performance, but DrugBank alone outperforms us-
ing both MetaMap and DrugBank. With the perfor-
mance difference range between the models being
only 2 pp, we think the results remain inconclusive.
That external data did not provide a further in-
crease might indicate that drug-drug interaction de-
tection is mostly a matter of interpreting the syn-
tactic parse, whereas drug-name recognition benefits
more from dictionary matching methods.
As with task 9.1, we analyse the classification er-
rors on the 10-fold classification performed on the
training dataset for which annotations are publicly
available (See Table 4). None of the DDI classes are
as hard to detect as the drug name class drug n, but
the int class has much lower performance than the
other classes, with most examples classified incor-
rectly as negatives.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983">
We applied the Turku Event Extraction System 2.1
to detection of both drug names and drug-drug in-
teractions in the DDIExtraction 2013 task. The sys-
tem showed good performance for both tasks, but we
must consider that name and interaction detection
were evaluated in isolation. In real world text min-
ing tasks, these steps will be consecutive and as such
result in lower overall performance. TEES achieves
good performance using deep syntactic parsing, but
this is a computationally expensive processing step.
When drug names are detected with TEES, all in-
put sentences need to be parsed, but if some other
method is used for drug name recognition, TEES can
parse just the sentences with drug names, as only
they can potentially contain DDIs, enabling much
faster DDI extraction.
We showed that adding external data from the
DrugBank database and from MetaMap prepro-
cessing can considerably increase extraction perfor-
mance. However, we assume this makes the sys-
tem more dependent on such data being available
for candidate drug names and DDIs in the text be-
ing processed, potentially making it harder to detect
completely new names and interactions. Therefore,
using external data is likely to introduce a tradeoff
of higher performance vs. wider detection. Use of
such data should be chosen according to the task, as
in some cases the goal is to retrieve documents with
known drugs and interactions, in others to maximize
detection of information not yet in the databases.
As with previous TEES versions, we will pro-
vide our source code freely available under an open
source license at the TEES project repository4. We
will also include a wrapper for using the MetaMap
tool via the TEES preprocessing pipeline, allowing
it to be easily integrated into event and relation ex-
traction tasks.

For drugrelated information extraction, two recent applications demonstrated that integrating the MetaMap program to their existing systems produces high overall performance in i.) identification and classification of the pharmaceutical substances and ii.) extraction of drug indication information (SeguraBedmar et al., 2008; Fung et al., 2013). MetaMap finds Metathesaurus concepts by performing a shallow syntactic analysis of the input text, producing a set of noun phrases. The noun phrases are then used to generate sets of variants which are consequently looked up from the Metathesaurus concepts. Matching concepts are evaluated against the original text and the strength of the mappings are calculated.

TEES achieves F-scores of 60% for the drug name recognition task and 59% for the DDI extraction task. 1 Introduction Drug-drug interactions (DDI) refer to one drug affecting the function of another when they are coadministered. These interactions are often adverse, frequently not well known and a source of potentially life-threatening unintended consequences for the patients. Databases such as DrugBank and Micromedex have been developed to store information about known DDIs, but at present their coverage remains limited and there can be inconsistencies in supplementary information (Knox et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2008). Text mining has been proposed as a solution for providing not only lists of DDIs but also a connection to the scientific evidence and supplementary information in the literature (Tari et al., 2010). Several groups of researchers are developing text-mining techniques to extract DDIs from literature and pharmaceutical documents (Tari et al., 2010; Segura-Bedmar et al., 2011a). The DDIExtraction 2013 shared task concerns the detection of drug mentions and statements of DDIs from unannotated text (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2013).

Before use, all DDIExtraction 2013 corpora are parsed with the TEES preprocessing pipeline, using the BLLIP parser with David McClosky’s biomodel to produce a Penn-tree style parse which is converted with the Stanford parser tools to the collapsed CC processed Stanford dependency scheme (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; McClosky, 2010; de Marneffe et al., 2006). 2.3 Drug name recognition with TEES For drug name recognition the TEES entity detector module is used. Baseline syntactic features (model 1) are generated from the parse, using both information on the tokens and their linear context, as well as dependency chains starting from the entity head token. External data is added to the head token features, from where it is combined into more complex features. One example is generated for each token in the sentence, and these are classified into negatives or one of the positive classes. As a new feature we generate all subs</context>

We also mark whether the candidate token exactly equals an annotation of one of these types, indicating cases where the token is e.g. a known brand name. For DDI extraction, we mark as a feature whether the drug name pair is listed in DrugBank as having interactions or not. We also mark if one of the drug names is not listed in DrugBank. 2.6 Using MetaMap for Domain Knowledge The MetaMap program has been used extensively for a wide array of BioNLP studies, such as automatic indexing of biomedical literature and conceptbased text summarization (Reeve et al., 2007; Quanzhi and Yi-Fang Brook, 2006). For drugrelated information extraction, two recent applications demonstrated that integrating the MetaMap program to their existing systems produces high overall performance in i.) identification and classification of the pharmaceutical substances and ii.) extraction of drug indication information (SeguraBedmar et al., 2008; Fung et al., 2013). MetaMap finds Metathesaurus concepts by performing a shallow syntactic analysis of the input text, producing a set of noun phrases. The noun phrases are then used to generate sets of variants which are consequently lo</context>

Here we give a general overview about applying the system for the current task. TEES processes text in a pipeline of components, starting from preprocessing tasks such as NER and parsing and proceeding to the multiple, consecutive steps of event extraction. As tasks 9.1 and 9.2 are independent of each other the entity and interaction detection components of TEES are used independently, and for preprocessing, only the parsing is done (See Figure 1). 2.2 Training data preparation TEES is a machine learning system based on support vector machines (SVM) (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005). To train the system for a new task, two datasets are required: a training set on which the SVM model is trained, and a development set on which the newly trained model is tested to determine parameter settings for optimal performance (See Figure 2). The optimal model can then be used to detect what it was trained for on unannotated datasets, such as the hidden shared task test set. The DDIExtraction 2013 corpus consists of two parts: A training corpus used for system development and a test corpus for evaluating the participating systems. The annotation of the test corpus is not revealed to t</context>
