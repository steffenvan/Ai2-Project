This paper presents one of the main
computerized resources of the research
Laboratory ATILF (Analyse et traitement
informatique de la langue française) available
via the Web: the computerized dictionary
TLFi (Trésor de la langue française

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999244">
A dictionary, in its electronic form, is a textual
database to be used in any natural language
processing system. The size and the contents of the
existing dictionaries vary a lot according to the
target of the attended public and the cost of their
collected resources.
In the article, we present one of our textual
resources, the TLFi which is the most important
computerized dictionary on French language. It is
accessible via the web at http://www.atilf.fr/tlfi.

<bodyText confidence="0.999980857142857">
Le Trésor de la langue française, The Treasury
of the French language, existed first as a paper
version. It is a dictionary of the 19th and 20th
century vocabulary, in 16 volumes. The first
volume was published in 1971 and the last one in
1993. It contains about 100 000 head words with
their etymology and history, that means 270 000
definitions, 430 000 examples with their source,
the majority of them are extracted from the
Frantext database.
The computerized version of the dictionary, the
TLFi (Trésor de la langue française informatisé),
contains the same data as the paper version, with
its 350 million characters. With the help of very
sophisticated automata, we have been able to insert
in the text a very complex set of XML tags in such
a way that every textual object is clearly identified
and that the hierarchy containing these objects is
clearly designed. With this tag set and thanks to its
software Stella, it can be seen as a lexical finely
structured database.

2.1 Stella: the Toolbox for the TLFi
exploitation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991337655172414">
As well as all the textual resources of the
laboratory, the textual database FRANTEXT
(www.atilf.fr/frantext), the 8th and 9th editions of
the dictionary of Académie française and several
others lexical database (Bernard et col, 2001 et
2002), the TLFi runs on its own specially
software program STELLA, written in the
laboratory,
Stella allows a compact data storage (with a
mathematically demonstrable optimality) of
structured texts (Dendien, 1996). Above all, it
offers, to developpers, very powerful tools for the
access and handling of textual data including
several XML hierarchical taggings.
Stella offers the users:
- An environment to make the requests. The
interface is very friendly, with a lot of help on line.
It offers fine-grained request possibilities, allowing
precision in the results.
- An optimal response time to all requests.
- A good quality of service: Stella contains a
linguistic “knowledge” (flexions, categorized
databases) which allows a user to make complex
requests.
- A powerful capacity of interrogation: a user can
write parametrable grammars to be used and re-
used in different contexts.
- A possibility of hypernavigation throughout all
the databases interconnected under Stella.

2.2 Specificities of the TLFi
2.2.1 The data:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945294117647">
Its originality is based, firstly, on its wordlist,
which is rich of about 100 000 entries, present
either in our funds or in other dictionaries. The
TLF was a pioneer in the treatment of morphemes
or in the treatment of structures of specific
vocabularies.
Secondly, it is original too, by the richness of the
number of examples, about 430000, and syntagms,
about 165 000, quoted throughout its 16 volumes.
Besides, its list of metatextual objects such as
headwords, definitions, indications of domains,
semantic and stylistic indicators, examples with
their sources, fixed phrases is exceptional. About
40 different metatextual objects.
The data are proposed in different sections:
synchrony, etymology, history, pronunciation,
bibliography.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.688891">
2.2.2 The structure:
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996028">
One of the main advantages of a computerized
dictionary is to consider it as a knowledge database
in which one can extract any items contained in
any textual object. In order to get the most relevant
answers when querying the database, the XML tag
set is divided into two subsets : the tags of the first
subset are used as delimiters and identifiers of the
different kinds of textual objects used in the TLF ;
the tags of the second subset represent the
hierarchical organisation of the articles, in a way
similar to the block structure of modern
programming languages. This introduces very
useful notions:
The scope of an object (from a pragmatic point of
view it is the paragraph in which the object appears
plus all the subparagraphs of this paragraph) is the
smallest block containing this object.
The comparison of the scopes defines a binary
relation between objects. Let us take the example
of an article devoted to the headword W,
containing the stylistic indicator “popular” and an
example of Zola. Does this example illustrate a
popular sense of W? The answer is yes if the scope
of the indicator contains the scope of the example,
otherwise the answer is no.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.704819">
2.2.3 The different level of queries :
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999759384615385">
Three levels of queries are possible depending on
the users’s need.
2.2.3.1. First level : Simple visualization of an
article.
You can read an article dedicated to a specific
headword by three means.
Firstly, you have the possibility to write the word
with mistakes if you do not know the right spelling
of the word. That is very useful for the users who
do not remember the right accents (acute, grave or
circumflex) for instance. All kinds of mistakes
(like bad or omitted accents, simple/double
consonants, missing hyphens) are allowed. What is
more, any mistake is possible as long as the right
pronunciation is correct. For instance, if you write
“ornitorink”, the article “ornithorynque” will be
found. It is also possible to enter an inflected form
of a verb (ex. danseront) or of an adjective or
noun (ex. généraux), or even a phonetic equivalent
of such a form (ex. jénéro), even with bad accents
(ex. jenero).
Secondly, you can use the possibility of seeing the
list of the main articles contained in the TLFi, this
allows the user to discover unknown words, just as
if he was turning the pages of the paper version of
the dictionary.
Thirdly, the user can find an article thanks to
selecting sounds and not alphabetical characters.
At that level of consulting, you read the dictionary
article by article, yet with easy ways of searching a
word.
2.2.3.2. Second level : aided requests.
At that level you have the possibility of using the
dictionary as a textual knowledge database and to
make queries throughout the 16 volumes in one
click of mouse. One can make requests on graphic
forms, on inflected forms as well, on sequences of
words ...
The requests can be mono-criterion or multi-
criteria. Examples of mono-criterion requests : all
the words borrowed from Spanish language, all the
words of a specific domain, all the onomatopoeias,
all the metaphors and so on. By specifying several
criteria, one can extract from the dictionary all the
nouns of a specific domain, all the verbs which are
used with a stylistic indicator (for instance
“popular”) and which have been used by an author
(for instance Victor Hugo). Other example : one
can extract also all the definitions which contain a
word (for instance instrument) and which at the
same time do not contain the word measure, and
which are found in the domain of optics, and so on.
2.2.3.3. Third level : complex requests.
The user, at that level, can seek for a set of textual
objects {O1, O2,..., On} imposing them to be
conformant to a set of constraints combining the
type, the contents and the relations between
objects.
Type and contents specifications are sometimes
possible in other computerized dictionaries query
systems. They allow to find articles talking about
architecture or containing an example contained
from Zola. Suppose now that we are looking for
articles where an example of Zola is related to the
domain architecture. The simple fact to combine
the two criteria (must talk about architecture and
contain examples of Zola), is not enough : may be
some part of the article is not devoted to
architecture. If the example of Zola is in such a
part, the article is not relevant.
In the TLFi, the problem is solved with a new kind
of constraint, by using the scope of objects. We
will state that the example must be hierarchically
inferior to the domain. Thus, all the articles where
the example is not in the scope of the domain will
be shifted.
This feature is nothing but the simple reflect of the
XML tags representing the hierarchy. It gives the
TLFi query system an incredible accuracy.
Strangely enough, it seems to be ignored in other
computarized dictionaries, with the consequence of
very poor quality results.
This powerful feature, plus many other ones, such
as the possibility to make list of words in many
ways (manually, by automatical generation of the
inflected forms of a given lemma, or by high level
regular expressions selection) and reuse them in
requests, allied to the rich content of the TLFi and
a very friendly user’s interface, with help on line,
allow very complex querying, with pertinent
results.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.997296" genericHeader="method">
3 Hypernavigation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995836">
Hypernavigation throughout all the databases
interconnected under Stella is possible. For
example, when consulting the TLFi and by simply
clicking on any word in an article, the user can
navigate towards another article of the TLFi,
towards a lexical database giving information on
the grammatical category of the word, towards the
8th edition of the dictionary of the French Academy
(1932-1935), towards the 9th edition (started in
1990), towards the historical database for French
language, called DDL, giving new datations for
words or phrases, and also towards the database
FRANTEXT, which enables the user to discover
other or more examples on a given word.
Historically, the base derives from the texts
assembled for providing examples to be used in the
elaboration of the Trésor de la langue française
(TLF). This first raison d’être turned to a new one:
the desire to offer the scientific community a vast
corpus of texts linked to an efficient query tool.
Nowadays, FRANTEXT is a textual database
which currently includes 3737 French texts
covering a period from 1505 to the present day,
amounting in all to more than 217 millions of
words.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.588238" genericHeader="method">
4 Uses of the TLFi
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946621621622">
At the start the TLF in its paper version was
intended to a public of specialists in linguistics,
erudite persons and scholars.
The computerization of its data, the friendly
interface with its help on line, the capacities of the
software Stella give a new life to the TLF.
As described above, all the possibilities of
queries allow anyone, specialist or not, to extract
any piece of information from that textual
database.
The TLFi is directed at the widest audience with
the possibility of making queries without knowing
the right spelling of a word. The majority of
electronic dictionaries do not offer this possibility
of access to words when spelling is unknown by
the user. For instance, in the French word
“sculpture”, the letter -p- is mute. Thanks to this
first query of research, the user can ask the word
by its spelling : “skultur”. The right answer will be
immediately found. Besides, another friendly way
to read the computerized TLFi consists in putting
in evidence one or several textual objects by
colouring them.
Its interest for linguistic research is obvious for
it is a powerful tool to help the user who wants to
study grammatical classes (verbs, adjectives,
adverbs, for instance), syntactical classes (in
studying constructions of a verb, more precisely,
the user can find the verbs which are followed by
the french preposition “de”), etymological classes
(verbs borrowed from a language, Latin or
English), stylistic classes (ironical or metaphorical
uses, for instance all the adverbs used in slang),
morphological classes (the words ending with a
suffix, or beginning with a prefix, for instance all
the verbs ending with the suffix –age and which
are an action of a verb). It is also possible to
exclude the content of a textual object, for instance
if the user wants to extract all the words ending
with the suffix –able which are not adjectives.
The use of the TLFi can also be foreseen for
learning and teaching French language. Actually
we are thinking, on one hand, about the pedagogic
possibilities given by that computerized dictionary
such as it is available at the moment, and on the
other hand, about the modifications we could make
in order to encourage its use in education
In the use of the TLFi in teaching such as it is at
present, we have defined a methodology whose
aim is to allow the use of this important linguistic
resource. In collaboration with a teacher we have
prepared and experimented a set of pedagogical
activities for children in the CE1 class (7 years
old). The results show that young children, who
are learning to read, are able, alone or in pairs, to
use the TLFi to write a word in capital letters, to
tell its grammatical category, to find a noun phrase
or verb phrase containing this word or to say
whether it is monosemic or polysemic.
As regards the modifications we could
implement in order to get the TLFi to adapt to the
learners, we could mention different types of
modifications according to the ages of the learners.
Firstly, we could, in the articles, change the literary
examples extracted from the textual database
Frantext for examples coming from another textual
database containing youth literature. Secondly, we
intend to present the information in a slightly
different way. For instance, the syntagms could be
found at start of a new paragraph, instead of being
at a place where it is not easy to detect them for a
young learner. Thirdly, we intend to give specific
helps and commentaries on line to guide the young
learner.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926">
Designed and produced first as a paper
dictionary, the TLFi is nowadays a computerized
dictionary in which each user, linguist or not, can
make successfully simple or complex requests. We
will produce a CD-Rom version in autum 2004
but yet every one can have a free access at:
