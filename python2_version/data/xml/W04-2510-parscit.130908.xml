Question Answering (QA) systems (as QA track of
the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-QA) competi-
tions (Voorhees 2001)), are able both to understand
questions in natural language and to produce answers in
the form of selected paragraphs extracted from very
large collections of text. Generally, they are open-
domain systems, and do not rely on specialised concep-
tual knowledge as they use a mixture of statistical tech-
niques and shallow linguistic analysis. Ontological
Question Answering systems, e.g. (Woods et al. 1972,
Zajac 2000) propose to attack the problem by means of
an internal unambiguous knowledge representation. As
any knowledge intensive application, ontological QA
systems have as intrinsic limitation related to the small
scale of the underlying syntactic-semantic models of
natural language.
While limitations are well-known, we are still ques-
tioning if any improvement has occurred since the de-
velopment of the first ontological QA system LUNAR.
Several important facts have emerged that could influ-
ence related research approaches:
a growing availability of lexical knowledge bases
that model and structure words: WordNet (Miller
1995) and EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998) among
others; some open-domain QA systems have proven
the usefulness of these resources, e.g. WordNet in
the system described in (Harabagiu et al. 2001).
the vision of a Web populated by “ontologically”
tagged documents which the semantic Web initia-
tive has promoted; in case this vision becomes a re-
ality, it will require a world-wide collaborative
work for building interrelated “conceptualisations”
of domain specific knowledge
the trend in building shallow, modular, and robust
natural language processing systems (Abney 1996,
Hobbs et al. 1996, Ait-Moktar&amp;Chanod 1997,
Basili&amp;Zanzotto 2002) which is making them ap-
pealing in the context of ontological QA systems,
both for text interpretation (Andreasen et al. 2002)
and for database access (Popescu et al. 2003).
Given this background, we are investigating a new
approach to ontology-based QA in which users ask
questions in natural language to knowledge bases of
facts extracted from a federation of Web sites and or-
ganised in topic map repositories (Garshol 2003). Our
approach is being investigated in the context of EU pro-
ject MOSES1, with the explicit objective of developing
an ontology-based methodology to search, create, main-
tain and adapt semantically structured Web contents
according to the vision of the Semantic Web. MOSES is
taking advantage of expertise coming from several
fields: software agent technology, NLP, graph theory

and text mining. The test-bed chosen in the project is
related to the development of an ontology-based knowl-
edge management system and an ontology-based search
engine that will both accept questions and produce an-
swers in natural language for the Web sites of two
European universities. The challenges of the project are:
building an ontological QA system;
developing a multilingual environment which im-
plies the ability to treat several languages, and, im-
portantly, several conceptualisations.
In this paper, after briefly describing how the project
is trying to comply with the semantic Web vision, we
will focus on question processing, and in particular on
the way in which NLP techniques and ontological
knowledge interact in order to support questions to spe-
cific sites or to site federations.
An ontology-based approach to question
answering
In our ontological QA system, both questions and
domain knowledge are represented by the same onto-
logical language. It is foreseen to develop the QA sys-
tem in two steps. First a prototypical implementation is
planned to answer questions related to the current
“state-of-affairs” of the site to which the question is
posed. In a second step, given a “federation” of sites
within the same domain, we will investigate whether
and how an ontological approach could support QA
across the sites. Answering a question can then be seen
as a collaborative task between ontological nodes be-
longing to the same QA system. Since each node has its
own version of the domain ontology, the task of passing
a question from node to node may be reduced to a map-
ping task between (similar) conceptual representations.
To make such an approach feasible, a number of diffi-
cult problems must still be solved. In this paper, we will
provide details on how:
to build on existing ontologies and interface be-
tween them and language resources;
to interpret questions wrt the ontological language;
to model the mapping task for federated questions.

Building on off-the-shelf semantic Web on-
tologies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98398155">
One of the results of the Semantic Web initiative
will be the production of many interrelated domain-
specific ontologies that provide the formal language for
describing the content of Web documents. In spite of the
freedom allowed in the production of new conceptuali-
sations, it is reasonable to expect that a first knowledge
representation jungle will leave room to a more orderly
place where only the more appreciated conceptualisa-
tions have survived. This is a prerequisite for achieving
interoperability among software agents. In view of this,
and since publicly available non-toy ontology examples
are already available, the effort of adapting an existing
ontology to a specific application is both useful and
possible. This experiment is being conducted in MOSES
to treat the university domain.
Ontologies for the Semantic Web are written in for-
mal languages (OWL, DAML+OIL, SHOE) that are
generalisations/restrictions of Description Logics
(Baader et al. 2003). TBox assertions describe concepts
and relations. A typical entry for a concept is:

<tableCaption confidence="0.994577">

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999899125">
where ID is the concept unique identifier, label is
the readable name of the concept, subclassof indicates
the relation to another class. As the label has the only
purpose of highlighting the concept to human readers,
alternative linguistic expressions are not represented.
On the contrary, this piece of information is recorded in
a lexical data base like WordNet. The problem is even
more obvious when considering relationships.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.97765745">
In Table 2, domain and range contain the two con-
cepts related to the described binary relation. The label
teacherOf does not mention alternative linguistic ex-
pressions like: #Faculty gives #Course or #Faculty de-
livers #Course, etc.
For the ontology producers, only one concept or re-
lation name is sufficient. Synonymy is not a relevant
phenomenon in ontological representations. In fact, it is
considered a possible generator of unnecessary concept
name clashes, i.e. concept name ambiguity. Conceptu-
alisations (as in tables 1,2) are inherently weak when-
ever used to define linguistic models for NLP
applications. Interpreting questions like:
(1) Who gives/teaches the database class/course
this year?
with respect to a university domain ontology means
in fact mapping all the questions onto the concepts and
relations in Table 2. There is a gap to be filled between
linguistic and ontological ways of expressing the do-
main knowledge.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.578794">
Linguistic interfaces to ontologies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998505882353">
In developing an ontological QA system, the main
problem is to build what we call the “linguistic inter-
face” to the ontology which consists of all the linguistic
expressions used to convey concepts and relationships.
To make this attempt viable, we are currently studying
methods to automatically relate lexical knowledge bases
like WordNet (Miller 1995) to domain ontologies
(Basili et al 2003a) and to induce syntactic-semantic
patterns for relationships (Basili et al 2003b).
The linguistic interface constitutes the basis on
which to build the semantic model of the natural lan-
guage processing sub-system. One way of conceiving
such a model is in terms of syntactic-semantic mapping
rules that apply to alternative expressions of the same
conceptual knowledge. The amount of syntactic analy-
sis such rules foresee will vary according to the ap-
proach chosen.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.928166">
Classifying questions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999599916666667">
To facilitate recognition of what are the relevant ex-
pressions to be encoded in the linguistic interface, we
have introduced a classification of the possible ques-
tions that the system is expected to support. A classifi-
cation often quoted is that in Lauer, Peacocok and
Graesser (1992), which mainly builds on speech act
theory. Another influential, more syntactically-oriented
approach is that in Moldovan et al. (1999) where to each
syntactic category correspond one or several possible
answer types, or focuses (a person, a date, a name, etc.).
Several dimensions have been identified as relevant
for MOSES
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9965325">
1. the number of sites and pages in which the an-
swer is to be found. Thus, a first distinction is
done between site-specific and federated ques-
tions. In the first case, analysis involves only
one language and one knowledge domain. In
the second, the interpretation of a question
produced by a local linguistic analyser is
matched against the knowledge domain of
other sites;
2. sub-domain coverage (e.g. people, courses, re-
search).
3. format of the answer: which in MOSES is not
only a text paragraph as in standard QA, but
could also be composed of one or more in-

stances of semantic concepts (professors,

sources
These dimensions have been explored in “question
cards” defined by the project’s user groups2.

From the point of view of the linguistic analysis,
however, syntactic category and content are the central
dimensions of sentence classification. Syntactic catego-
ries are e.g. yes/no question, what-question, who-
question, etc. Subtypes relate to the position inside the
question where the focus is expressed, e.g. depending
on whether the wh-pronoun is a determiner, or the main
verb is a copula. The content consists of concepts and
relations from the ontology, the focus constraint3 (the
ontological type being questioned), and a count feature
indicating the number of instances to be retrieved. Table
3 shows an example of linguistic classification. For each
sentence type, several paraphrases are described.
Ontology Mapping in a Multilingual Envi-
ronment: challenges
The conceptualisation of the university world as it
appears in the DAML+OIL ontology library is an inter-
esting representation for the application scenarios tar-
geted in MOSES (i.e. People/Course/Research).
Described classes and relations cover in fact, at least at
a high level, most of the relevant concepts of the ana-
lysed scenarios. Such an ontology has been adapted to
develop conceptualisations for each of the two national

university sub-systems (i.e. Italian and Danish) while
providing additional information required for answering
the input questions. This is temporal information or
other kind of information at a border line with the do-
main, (e.g. concepts related to the job market). A first
important matter we have dealt with is the language.
Whereas concept and relation labels in the Italian ontol-
ogy are expressed either in English (for concepts di-
rectly taken from the original source) or in Italian, in the
Danish counterpart all labels are in Danish. This means
that a mapping algorithm making use of string similarity
measures applied to concept labels will have to work
with translation, either directly between the two lan-
guages involved, or via a pivot language like English.
The goal would be to establish correspondences such as
‘Lektor’ (‘AssociateProfessor’) ‘ProfessoreAsso-
ciato’.
Another problem is related to structural differences:
not all the nodes in an ontology are represented also in
the other and vice-versa, moreover nodes that are
somehow equivalent, may have different structural
placements. This is the case for the ‘Lek-
tor’/’ProfessoreAssociato’ pair just mentioned: in the
Danish system, ‘Lektor’ is not a subclass of ‘Professor’,
although “associate professor” is considered a correct
translation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.858358">
Question analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999896">
Question analysis is carried out in the MOSES lin-
guistic module associated with each system node. To
adhere to the semantic Web approach, MOSES poses no
specific constraints on how the conceptual representa-
tion should be produced, nor on the format of the output
of each linguistic module. The agent that passes this
output to the content matcher (an ontology-based search
engine) maps the linguistic representation onto a com-
mon MOSES interchange formalism (still in an early
development phase). Two independent modules have
been developed for Danish and Italian language analy-
sis. They have a similar architecture (both use preproc-
essing, i.e. POS-tagging and lemmatising, prior to
syntactic and semantic analyses), but specific parsers.
Whereas the Danish parser, an adapted version of PET
(Callmeier 2000) produces typed feature structures
(Copestake 2002), the Italian one outputs quasi-logical
forms. Both representation types have proven adequate
to express the desired conceptual content. As an exam-
ple, the Italian analysis module is described below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.507167">
Analysis of Italian questions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993437842105263">
Analysis of Italian questions is carried out by using
two different linguistic interpretation levels. The syntac-
tic interpretation is built by a general purpose robust
syntactic analyser, i.e. Chaos (Basili&amp;Zanzotto 2002).
This will produce a Question Quasi-Logical Form (Q-
QLF) of an input question based on the extended de-
pendency graph formalism (XDG) introduced in
(Basili&amp;Zanzotto 2002). In this formalism, the syntac-
tic model of the sentence is represented via a planar
graph where nodes represent constituents and arcs the
relationships between them. Constituents produced are
chunks, i.e. kernels of verb phrases (VPK), noun
phrases (NPK), prepositional phrases (PPK) and adjec-
tival phrases (ADJK). Relations among the constituents
represent their grammatical functions: logical subjects
(lsubj), logical objects (lobj), and prepositional modifi-
ers. For example, the Q-QLF of the question
(2) Chi insegna il corso di Database?
(Who teaches the database course?)

is shown in Figure 1.

Then a robust semantic analyser, namely the Dis-
course Interpreter from LaSIE (Humphreys et al. 1996)
is applied. An internal world model has been used to
represent the way in which the relevant concepts (i.e.
objects) and relationships (i.e. events) are associated
with linguistic forms (see Figure 2). Under the object
node, concepts from the domain concept hierarchy are
mapped onto synsets (sets of synonyms) in the linguistic
hierarchy EWN (i.e. the EuroWordNet.base concepts).
This is to guarantee that linguistic reasoning analysis is
made using general linguistic knowledge.

<bodyText confidence="0.96786590625">
The association of objects and events with linguistic
forms is used in matching rules as shown in Figure 3.
The rule expresses the fact that, if any word like tenere,
insegnare or fare is encountered in relation with a hu-
man_1 (represented by the base concept ewn4123) and
the word education_1 (ewn567704), the relation teach-
erOf can be induced.
The analysis resulting for sentence (2) is then:
focus(e2),
relation(e1,teacherOf),
r_arg1(e1, person_dch(e2)),
r_arg2(e1,course_dch(e3)),
relation(e4,hasSubject),
r_arg1(e4, course_dch(e3)),
r_arg2(e4,topic_dch(&amp;quot;Database&amp;quot;)).
This means that the user is interested in a person, the
entity e2 of the class person_dch, that is in a relation
teacherOf with the entity e4 (instance of the class
course_dch), that is in turn related by hasSubject
with the topic (i.e. topic_dch) &amp;quot;Database&amp;quot;. This result
can be passed on to the content matcher.
Treating federated questions
Now we want to extend this approach to question
analysis in order to manage federated questions. A pos-
sible solution would be sending the natural language
question to several nodes and let each node interpret it
against its own domain knowledge. This is unfeasible in
a multilingual environment. The solution we are inves-
tigating is based on the notion of ontology mapping. Let
us consider the case of a student questioning not only
the Danish but also the Italian site (by selecting specific
modalities for entering questions):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.793534">
(3) Hvem er lektor i fransk?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964868">
(Who is associate professor of French?)
As the question is in Danish, it has to be analysed by
the Danish analysis component, which will produce a
semantic interpretation roughly corresponding to the
following term:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9053935">
all(x) (lektor(x) &amp; CourseOffer(x,y) &amp;
Course(y) &amp; Name(y, French))4
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993906285714286">
Since all concepts and relations come from the Dan-
ish ontology, it is not a problem to query the Danish
knowledge base for all relevant examples. In order to
query the Italian knowledge base, however, equivalent
concepts and relations must be substituted for those in
the “Danish” interpretation. The corresponding Italian
representation is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.940344">
all(x) (ProfessoreAssociato(x) &amp;
TeacherOf(x,y) &amp; Course(y) &amp;
Subject(y, French))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966227272727">
The first problem is establishing a correspondence
between ‘lektor’ and ‘ProfessoreAssociato’, which as
shown in the ontology fragments below are not structur-
ally equivalent.
As suggested in (Pazienza&amp;Vindigni 2003, Med-
che&amp;Staab 2001), equivalence relations must be estab-
lished by considering is-a structures and lexical concept
labels together. In the example under discussion, an
initial equivalence can be posited between the top nodes
of the two ontology fragments, since they both refer
explicitly to the original DAML+OIL ontology via a
sameAs relation. However, none of the concept labels
under ‘Faculty’ in the Italian ontology are acceptable
translations of ‘Lektor’, nor do any of the nodes refer to
common nodes in a common reference ontology. Thus,
the matching algorithm must search further down for en
equivalent concept by considering possible translations
of concept labels and testing the relations that equiva-
lence candidates participate in. Thus, distance from a
common starting node, lexical equivalence and occur-
rence in similar relations are all constraints to be con-
sidered.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.99878675">
4 All concepts and relations will in fact be expressed in
Danish. Here,to facilitate non-Danish readers, we are using
English equivalents with the exception of the concept ‘Lek-
tor’ under discussion.

The same problem of finding a correct mapping ap-
pears for the relations. In this case, we must be able to
discover that CourseOffer and TeacherOf represent the
same relation. For instance we can rely on the fact that
they have both two roles, and the concepts filling these
roles, Faculty and Course (or rather the Danish and Ital-
ian equivalent concepts) correspond. Discovering simi-
larities between relations, however, may be a much
more complex task than shown in this example. In gen-

Our focus in this paper has been, in the context of
ontology-based QA, to discuss how to interface between
ontology and linguistic resources on the one hand, and
ontology and natural language questions on the other
while remaining within a unique framework. An inter-
esting issue in a multilingual environment is how to
support questions to federation of sites organised around
local ontologies. We have begun to address this issue in
terms of ontology mapping. Specific algorithms for
machine learning and information extraction have also
been identified and are under development.

The system is under development in the MOSES European Project. Introduction Question Answering (QA) systems (as QA track of the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-QA) competitions (Voorhees 2001)), are able both to understand questions in natural language and to produce answers in the form of selected paragraphs extracted from very large collections of text. Generally, they are opendomain systems, and do not rely on specialised conceptual knowledge as they use a mixture of statistical techniques and shallow linguistic analysis. Ontological Question Answering systems, e.g. (Woods et al. 1972, Zajac 2000) propose to attack the problem by means of an internal unambiguous knowledge representation.

As any knowledge intensive application, ontological QA systems have as intrinsic limitation related to the small scale of the underlying syntactic-semantic models of natural language. While limitations are well-known, we are still questioning if any improvement has occurred since the development of the first ontological QA system LUNAR. Several important facts have emerged that could influence related research approaches: a growing availability of lexical knowledge bases that model and structure words: WordNet (Miller 1995) and EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998) among others; some open-domain QA systems have proven the usefulness of these resources, e.g. WordNet in the system described in (Harabagiu et al. 2001). the vision of a Web populated by “ontologically” tagged documents which the semantic Web initiative has promoted; in case this vision becomes a reality, it will require a world-wide collaborative work for building interrelated “conceptualisations” of domain specific knowledge the trend in building shallow, modular, and robust natural language processing systems (Abney 1996, Hobbs et al. 1996, Ait-Moktar&amp;Chanod 1997, Basili&amp;Zanzotto 2002) whi</context>
