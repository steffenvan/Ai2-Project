In computational linguistics, which began in the
1950&apos;s with machine translation, systems that are
based mainly on the lexicon have a longer tradition
than anything else---for these purposes, twenty five
years must be allowed to count as a tradition. The
bulk of many of the early translation systems was made
up by a dictionary whose entries consisted of
arbitrary instructions in machine language. In the
early 60&apos;3, computational linguists---at least those
with theoretical pretentions---abandoned this way of
doing business for at least three related reasons:
First systems containing large amounts of unrestricted
machine code fly in the face of all principles of good
programming practice. The syntax of the language in
which linguistic facts are stated is so remote from
their semantics that the opportunities for error are
very great and no assumptions can be made about the
effects on the system of invoking the code associated
with any given word. The systems became virtually
unmaintainable and eventually fell under their own
weight. Furthermore, these failings were magnified as
soon as the attempt was made to impose more structure
on the overall system. A general backtracking scheme,
for example, could all too easily be thrown into
complete disarray by an instruction in a single
dictionary entry that affected the oontrol stack.
Second, the power of general, and particularly
nondeterministic, algorithms in syntactic analysis
came to be appreciated, if not overappreciated.
Suddenly, it was no longer necessary to seek local
criteria on which to ensure the correctness of
individual decisions made by the program provided they
were covered by more global criteria. Separation of
program and linguistic data became an overriding
principle and, since it was most readily applied to
syntactic rules, these became the main focus of
attention.
The third, and doubtless the most important, reason
for the change was that syntactic theories in which a
grammar was seen as consisting of a set of rules,
preferably including transformational rules, captured
the imagination of the most influential
noncomputational linguists, and computational
linguists followed suite if only to maintain
theoretical respectability. In short, systems with
small sets of rules in a constrained formalism and
simple lexical entries apparently made for simpler,
cleaner, and more powerful programa while setting the
whole enterprise on a sounder theoretical footing.
The trend is now in the opposite direction. There has
been a shift of emphasis sway from highly structured
systems of complex rules as the principle repository
of information about the syntax of a language towards
a view in which the responsibility is distributed
among the lexicon, semantic parts of the linguistic
description, and a cognitive or strategic component.
Concomitantly, interest has shifted from algorithma
for syntactic analysis and generation, in which the
control structure and the exact sequence of events are
paramount, to systems in which a heavier burden is
carried by the data structure and in which the order
of events is a matter of strategy. This new trend is
a common thread running through several of the papers
in this section.
Various techniques for syntactic analysis, notably
those based on some form of Augmented Transition
Network (ATN), represent grammatical facts in terms of
executable machine code. The dangers to which thin
exposed the earlier systems are avoided by insisting
that this code by compiled from statements in
formalism that allows only for linguistically
motivated operations on carefully controlled parts of
certain data structures.
The value of nondeterministic procedures is
undiminished, but it has become clear that it does not
rest on complex control structures and a rigidly
determined sequence of events. In discussing the
syntactic processors that we have developed, for
example, Ron Kaplan and I no longer find it useful to
talk in terms of e parsing a:gorithm. There are two
central data structures, a chart and an agenda. When
additions to the chart give rise to certain kinds of
configurations in which some element contains
executable code, a task is created and placed on the
agenda. Tasks are removed from the agenda and
executed in an order determined by strategic
considerations which constitute part of the linguistic
theory. Strategy can determine only the order in
which alternative analyses are produced. Many
traditional distinctions, such as that between top-
down and bottom-up processing, no longer apply to the
procedure as a whole but only to particular strategies
or their parts.
This looser organization of programs for syntactic
processing came, at least in part, from a generally
felt need to break down the boundaries that had
traditionally separated morphological, syntactic, and
semantic processes. Research directed towards speech
understanding systems was quite unable to respect
these boundaries because, in the face of unoertair
data, local moves in the analysis on one level
required confirmation from other levels so that a
common data structure for all levels of analysis and a
schedule that could change continually were of the
essence. Futhermore, there was a mouvement from
within the artifioial-intelligence community to
eliminate the boundaries because, from that
perspective, they lacked sufficient theoretical
justification.
In speech research in particular, and artificial
intelligence in general, the lexicon took on an
Important position if only because it is thee that
the units of meaning reside. Recent per .sals in
linguistic theory involve a larger role for the
lexicon. Bresnan (1978) has argued persuasively that
the full mechanism of transformational rules can, and
should, be dispensed with except in cases of unbounded
movement such as relativization and topicalizetton.
The remaining members Of the familiar list of
transformations can be handled by weaker devices in
the lexicon and, Since they all turn out to be
lexically governed, this is the appropriate place to
state the information.
Against this background, the papers that fellnw,
different though they are in many ways, constitute
fairly coherent set. Carbonell domes from the
artificial-intelligence tradition and is generally
concerned With the meanings of words and the ways in
which they are **fleeted to give the meanings of

had whatever properties&apos; allow a coherent analyst, of
the larger unit—say a sentence, or paragraph,---in
which it is imbedded. Thee&apos; properties are then
entered against it in the lexicon for future use. The
problem, which is faced in thia paper, is that the
poaaibility that the lexicon La deficient must be
faced in respect of all words becaueel even when there
is en entry in the lexioon, it may not supply the
reeding required in the case on hand. Small, like
Carbonell is concerned with the meaninge of words and
he is lead to a view of words as active agents, The
main role of the syatem is to act 44 moderator.
Kwaany and 3onheimer have a concern to Carbonell&apos;s.
When problems arise in analysis, they look for
deficiencies in the text rather than in the lexicon
and the rules. It is no indictment of either paper
that they provide no way of distinguiahing the cases,
for this is clearly a separate enterprise. Kwasny and
Sonheimer propose progressively weakening the
requirements that their analysis system makes of 4
segment of text so that, if it does not accord with
the beat principals of composition, an analysis can
still be found by taking a less demanding view of it.
Such a technique clearly rests on * regime in which
the scheduling of events is relatively free and the
control structure relatively fret.
Shapiro shows how a strong data structure and a weak
control structure make it possible to extend the ATN
beyond the analysis of one dimensional strings to
semantic, networks. The result is a total spot= with
remarkable consistency in the methods applied at all
levels and, presumably, corresponding simplicity and
clarity in the architecture of the system as a whole.
Allen is one of the foremost contributors to research
on speech understanding, and speech processing in
general. He stresses the need for strongly
Interacting components at different levels of analyais
and, to that extent, argues for the kind of data-
directed methods / have tried to characterize.
At first reading, Eiaenatadt&apos;s paper appears least
willing to lie in my Procrustean bed, for it appears
to be concerned with the finer points of algorithmic
design and, to an extent, this is true. But, the two
approaches to syntactic analysis that are compared
turn out to be, in my terms, algorithmically weak.
The most fundamental issues that are being discussed
therefore turn out to concern what I have called the
strategic component of linguistic theory, that is with
the rules according to which atomics tasks in the
analysis process are scheduled.
