Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999975666666666">
We show that discourse structure need not bear
the full burden of conveying discourse relations by
showing that many of them can be explained non-
structurally in terms of the grounding of anaphoric
presuppositions (Van der Sandt, 1992). This simpli-
fies discourse structure, while still allowing the real-
isation of a full range of discourse relations. This is
achieved using the same semantic machinery used
in deriving clause-level semantics.

<bodyText confidence="0.99990692">
Research on discourse structure has, by and large,
attempted to associate all meaningful relations
between propositions with structural connections
between discourse clauses (syntactic clauses or
structures composed of them). Recognising that this
could mean multiple structural connections between
clauses, Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and
Thompson, 1988) simply stipulates that only a
single relation may hold. Moore and Pollack (1992)
argue that both informational (semantic) and inten-
tional relations can hold between clauses simultan-
eously and independently. This suggests that factor-
ing the two kinds of relations might lead to a pair
of structures, each still with no more than a single
structural connection between any two clauses.
But examples of multiple semantic relations are
easy to find (Webber et al., 1999). Having struc-
ture account for all of them leads to the complex-
ities shown in Figure 1, including the crossing de-
pendencies shown in Fig. 1 c. These structures are
no longer trees, making it difficult to define a com-
positional semantics.
This problem would not arise if one recognised
additional, non-structural means of conveying se-
mantic relations between propositions and modal

operators on propositions. This is what we do here:
• Structurally, we assume a &amp;quot;bare bones&amp;quot; dis-
course structure built up from more complex
elements (LTAG trees) than those used in many
other approaches. These structures and the op-
erations used in assembling them are the basis
for compositional semantics.
• Stimulated by structural operations, inference
based on world knowledge, usage conventions,
etc., can then make defeasible contributions to
discourse interpretation that elaborate the non-
defeasible propositions contributed by com-
positional semantics.
• Non-structurally, we take additional semantic
relations and modal operators to be conveyed
through anaphoric presuppositions (Van der

Sandt, 1992) licensed by information that
speaker and hearer are taken to share. A main
source of shared knowledge is the interpreta-
tion of the on-going discourse. Because the
entity that licences (or &amp;quot;discharges&amp;quot;) a given
presupposition usually has a source within the
discourse, the presupposition seems to link the
clause containing the presupposition-bearing
(p-bearing) element to that source. However,
as with pronominal and definite NP anaphora,
while attentional constraints on their interpret-
ation may be influenced by structure, the links
themselves are not structural.
The idea of combining compositional semantics
with defeasible inference is not new. Neither is the
idea of taking certain lexical items as anaphorically
presupposing an eventuality or a set of eventualities:
It is implicit in all work on the anaphoric nature of
tense (cf. Partee (1984), Webber (1988), inter alia)
and modality (Stone, 1999). What is new is the way
we enable anaphoric presupposition to contribute to
semantic relations and modal operators, in a way

We discuss these differences in more detail in
Section 2, after describing the lexicalised frame-
work that facilitates the derivation of discourse se-
mantics from structure, inference and anaphoric
presuppositions. Sections 3 and 4 then present more
detailed semantic analyses of the connectives for ex-
ample and otherwise. Finally, in Section 5, we sum-
marize our arguments for the approach and suggest
a program of future work.

In previous papers (Cristea and Webber, 1997;
Webber and Joshi, 1998; Webber et al., 1999), we
have argued for using the more complex structures
(elementary trees) of a Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining
Grammar (LTAG) and its operations (adjoining and
substitution) to associate structure and semantics
with a sequence of discourse clauses.2 Here we
briefly review how it works.
In a lexicalized TAG, each elementary tree has at
least one anchor. In the case of discourse, the an-
chor for an elementary tree may be a lexical item,
punctuation or a feature structure that is lexically
null. The semantic contribution of a lexical anchor
includes both what it presupposes and what it as-
serts (Stone and Doran, 1997; Stone, 1998; Stone
and Webber, 1998). A feature structure anchor will
either unify with a lexical item with compatible fea-
tures (Knott and Mellish, 1996), yielding the previ-
ous case, or have an empty realisation, though one
&apos;One may still need to admit structures having both a link
back and a link forward to different clauses (Gardent, 1997).
But a similar situation can occur within the clause, with rel-
ative clause dependencies — from the verb back to the relative
pronoun and forward to a trace — so the possibility is not unmo-
tivated from the perspective of syntax.
2We take this to be only the most basic level of discourse
structure, producing what are essentially extended descriptions
of situations/events. Discourse may be further structured with
respect to speaker intentions, genre-specific presentations, etc.
that maintains its semantic features.
The initial elementary trees used here corres-
pond, by and large, to second-order predicate-
argument structures — i.e., usually binary predicates
on propositions or eventualities — while the auxil-
iary elementary trees provide further information
(constraints) added through adjoining.
Importantly, we bar crossing structural connec-
tions. Thus one diagnostic for taking a predicate
argument to be anaphoric rather than structural is
whether it can derive from across a structural link.
The relation in a subordinate clause is clearly struc-
tural: Given two relations, one realisable as &amp;quot;Al-
though a p, the other realisable as &amp;quot;Because y 8&amp;quot;,
they cannot together be realised as &amp;quot;Although a be-
cause y 13 8.&amp;quot; with the same meaning as &amp;quot;Although
a 13. Because y 8&amp;quot;. The same is true of certain re-
lations whose realisation spans multiple sentences,
such as ones realisable as &amp;quot;On the one hand a. On
the other hand 13.&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Not only y. But also 8.&amp;quot; To-
gether, they cannot be realised as &amp;quot;On the one hand
a. Not only y. On the other hand p. But also 8.&amp;quot;
with the same meaning as in strict sequence. Thus
we take such constructions to be structural as well
(Webber and Joshi, 1998; Webber et al., 1999).
On the other hand, the p-bearing adverb &amp;quot;then&amp;quot;,
which asserts that one eventuality starts after the
culmination of another, has only one of its argu-
ments coming structurally. The other argument is
presupposed and thus able to come from across a
structural boundary, as in

structurally through anaphoric presupposition.3
Now we illustrate briefly how short discourses
built from LTAG constituents get their semantics.

Webber etal., 1999). For more information on com-
positional semantic operations on LTAG derivation

(2) a. You shouldn&apos;t trust John because he never
returns what he borrows.
b. You shouldn&apos;t trust John. He never returns
what he borrows.
c. You shouldn&apos;t trust John because, for ex-
ample, he never returns what he borrows.
d. You shouldn&apos;t trust John. For example, he
never returns what he borrows.

Here A will stand for the LTAG parse tree for &amp;quot;you
shouldn&apos;t trust John&amp;quot; and a, its derivation tree, and
B will stand for the LTAG parse tree for &amp;quot;he never
returns what he borrows&amp;quot; and 13, its derivation tree.
The explanation of Example 2a is primarily struc-
tural. It involves an initial tree (y) anchored by &amp;quot;be-
cause&amp;quot; (Figure 2). Its derived tree comes from A
substituting at the left-hand substitution site of y (in-
dex 1) and B at the right-hand substitution site (in-
dex 3). Semantically, the anchor of y (&amp;quot;because&amp;quot;)
asserts that the situation associated with the argu-
ment indexed 3 (B) is the cause of that associated
with the argument indexed 1 (A).
The explanation of Example 2b is primarily struc-
tural as well. It employs an auxiliary tree (y)
anchored by &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; (Figure 3). Its derived tree comes
from B substituting at the right-hand substitution
site (index 3) of y, and y adjoining at the root of
A (index 0). Semantically, adjoining B to A via y
simply implies that B continues the description of
the situation associated with A. The general infer-
ence that this stimulates leads to a defeasible con-
tribution of causality between them, which can be
denied without a contradiction — e.g.
(3) You shouldn&apos;t trust John. He never returns
what he borrows. But that&apos;s not why you
shouldn&apos;t trust him.
Presupposition comes into play in Example 2c.
This example adds to the elements used in Ex-

crossing structural boundaries either.
ample 2a, an auxiliary tree anchored by &amp;quot;for ex-
ample&amp;quot; (8), which adjoins at the root of B (Fig-
ure 4). &amp;quot;For example&amp;quot; contributes both a presup-
position and an assertion, as described in more de-
tail in Section 3. Informally, &amp;quot;for example&amp;quot; presup-
poses a shared set of eventualities, and asserts that
the eventuality associated with the clause it adjoins
to, is a member of that set. In Example 2c, the set is
licensed by &amp;quot;because&amp;quot; as the set of causes/reasons
for the situation associated with its first argument.
Thus, associated with the derivation of (2c) are the
assertions that the situation associated with B is a
cause for that associated with A and that the situ-
ation associated with B is one of a set of such
causes.
Finally, Example 2d adds to the elements used in
Example 2b, the same auxiliary tree anchored by
&amp;quot;for example&amp;quot; (8). As in Example 2b, the causal-
ity relation between the interpretations of B and A
comes defeasibly from general inference. Of in-
terest then is how the presupposition of &amp;quot;for ex-
ample&amp;quot; is licenced — that is, what provides the
shared set or generalisation that the interpretation
of B is asserted to exemplify. It appears to be li-
cenced by the causal relation that has been inferred
to hold between the eventualities denoted by B and
A, yielding a set of causes/reasons for A.
Thus, while we do not yet have a complete char-
acterisation of how compositional semantics, de-
feasible inference and anaphoric presupposition in-
teract, Examples 2c and 2d illustrate one signific-
ant feature: Both the interpretive contribution of a
structural connective like &amp;quot;because&amp;quot; and the defeas-
ible inference stimulated by adjoining can license
the anaphoric presupposition of a p-bearing element
like &amp;quot;for example&amp;quot;.
Recently, Asher and Lascarides (1999) have de-
scribed a version of Structured Discourse Repres-
entation Theory (SDRT) that also incorporates the
semantic contributions of both presuppositions and
assertions. In this enriched version of SDRT, a pro-
position can be linked to the previous discourse via
multiple rhetorical relations such as background and
defeasible consequence. While there are similarities
between their approach and the one presented here,
the two differ in significant ways:

We illustrate these differences through Example 1
(repeated below), with the p-bearing element
&amp;quot;then&amp;quot;, and Example 5, with the p-bearing ele-
ment &amp;quot;too&amp;quot;. Both examples call into question the
claim that material licensing presuppositions is con-
strained to the right frontier of the evolving dis-
course structure.

knowledge of a similar eventuality, then the &amp;quot;too&amp;quot;
in Example 5(g) finds that eventuality in (b), which
is also unlikely to be on the right frontier of any

With respect to the interpretation of &amp;quot;too&amp;quot;, Asher
and Lascarides take it to presuppose a parallel rhet-
orical relation between the current clause and some-
thing on the right frontier. From this instantiated
rhetorical relation, one then infers that the related
eventualities are similar. But if the right frontier
constraint is incorrect and the purpose of positing
a rhetorical relation like parallel is to produce an
assertion of similarity, then one might as well take
&amp;quot;too&amp;quot; as directly presupposing shared knowledge of
a similar eventuality, as we have done here. Thus,
we suggest that the insights presented in (Asher and
Lascarides, 1999) have a simpler explanation.
Now, before embarking on more detailed ana-
lyses of two quite different p-bearing adverbs, we
should clarify the scope of the current approach in
terms of the range of p-bearing elements that can
create non-structural discourse links.
We believe that systematic study, perhaps starting
with the 350 &amp;quot;cue phrases&amp;quot; given in (Knott, 1996,
Appendix A), will show which of them use presup-
position in realising discourse relations. It is likely
that these might include:

For this study, one might be able to use the
structure-crossing test given in Section 2 to distin-
guish a relation whose arguments are both given
structurally from a relation which has one of its
arguments presupposed. (Since such a test won&apos;t
distinguish p-bearing connectives such as &amp;quot;mean-
while&amp;quot; from non-relational adverbials such as &amp;quot;at
dawn&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tonight&amp;quot;, the latter will have to be ex-

We take &amp;quot;For example, P&amp;quot; to presuppose a quanti-

the sentence P. (We will write generalisation(E,G.)

allows the inference of a proposition G&apos; of the
form Q2(x, a(x),b(x)); and (iii) G&apos; is inferrable
from G (through having a weaker quantifier).
The presupposed proposition G can be licensed
in different ways, as the following examples show:
(6) a. John likes many kinds of wine. For ex-
ample, he likes Chianti.
b. John must be feeling sick, because, for ex-

c. Because John was feeling sick, he did not

d. Why don&apos;t we go to the National Gallery.
Then, for example, we can go to the White

Example 6a is straightforward, in that the pre-
supposed generalisation &amp;quot;John likes many kinds of

propositions follow from his feeling sick. We can
represent both generalisations using the meta-level
predicate, evidence(n,C), which holds iff a premise
it is evidence for a conclusion C.
In Example 6d, the relevant generalisation in-
volves possible worlds associated jointly with the
modality of the first clause and &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; (Webber et
al., 1999). For consistency, the semantic interpreta-
tion of the clause introduced by &amp;quot;for example&amp;quot; must
make reference to the same modal base identified by
the generalisation. There is more on modal bases in

<bodyText confidence="0.9999179375">
Our analysis of &amp;quot;otherwise&amp;quot; assumes a modal se-
mantics broadly following Kratzer (1991) and Stone
(1999), where a sentence is asserted with respect to
a set of possible worlds. The semantics of &amp;quot;other-
wise a&amp;quot; appeals to two sets of possible worlds. One
is Wo, the set of possible worlds consistent with our
knowledge of the real world. The other, Wp, is that
set of possible worlds consistent with the condition
C that is presupposed. a is then asserted with re-
spect to the complement set Wo - Wp. Of interest
then is C — what it is that can serve as the source
licensing this presupposition.7
There are many sources for such a presupposi-
tion, including if-then constructions (Example 7a-
7b), modal expressions (Examples 7c— 7d) and in-
finitival clauses (Example 7e)

modifier (e.g. &amp;quot;He&apos;s an otherwise happy boy.&amp;quot;) or a clausal
modifier (e.g., &amp;quot;The physical layer is different, but otherwise
it&apos;s identical to metropolitan networks.&amp;quot;). What is presupposed

each of which introduces new possibilities that are
consistent with our knowledge of the real world
(%), that may then be further described through
modal subordination (Roberts, 1989; Stone and
Hardt, 1999).
That such possibilities must be consistent with
Wo (i.e., why the semantics of &amp;quot;otherwise&amp;quot; is not
simply defined in terms of Wp) can be seen by con-
sidering the counterfactual variants of 7a-7d, with
&amp;quot;had been&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;could have been&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;should have
taken&amp;quot;. (Epistemic &amp;quot;must&amp;quot; can never be counterfac-
tual.) Because counterfactuals provide an alternat-
ive to reality, Wp is not a subset of Wo — and we
correctly predict a presupposition failure for &amp;quot;other-
wise&amp;quot;. For example, corresponding to 7a we have:
(8) If the light had been red, John would have
stopped. #0therwise, he went straight on.
The appropriate connective here — allowing for what
actually happened — is &amp;quot;as it is&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;as it was&amp;quot;.8
As with &amp;quot;for example&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;otherwise&amp;quot; is compat-
ible with a range of additional relations linking dis-
course together as a product of discourse structure
and defeasible inference. Here, the clauses in 7a and
7c provide a more complete description of what to
do in different circumstances, while those in 7b, 7d
and 7e involve an unmarked &amp;quot;because&amp;quot;, as did Ex-
ample 2d. Specifically, in 7d, the &amp;quot;otherwise&amp;quot; clause
asserts that the hearer is cold across all currently
possible worlds where a coat is not taken. With
the proposition understood that the hearer must not
get cold (i.e., that only worlds where the hearer is
not cold are compatible with what is required), this
allows the inference (modus tollens) that only the
worlds where the hearer takes a coat are compat-
ible with what is required. As this is the proposi-
tion presented explicitly in the first clause, the text is
compatible with an inferential connective like &amp;quot;be-
cause&amp;quot;. (Similar examples occur with &amp;quot;epistemic&amp;quot;
because.)
Our theory correctly predicts that such discourse
relations need not be left implicit, but can instead be
explicitly signalled by additional connectives, as in
8There is a reading of the conditional which is not coun-
terfactual, but rather a piece of free indirect speech report-
ing on John&apos;s train of thought prior to encountering the light.
This reading allows the use of &amp;quot;otherwise&amp;quot; with John&apos;s thought
providing the base set of worlds 14/0, and &amp;quot;otherwise&amp;quot; then in-
troducing a complementary condition in that same context:
If the light had been red, John would have stopped.
Otherwise, he would have carried straight on. But
as it turned out, he never got to the light.

Here, compositional semantics says that the second
clause continues the description of the situation par-
tially described by the first clause. General infer-
ence enriches this with the stronger, but defeasible
conclusion that the second clause provides evidence
for the first. Based on the presupposition of &amp;quot;oth-
erwise&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;otherwise&amp;quot; clause asserts that John&apos;s
light would be off across all possible worlds where
he was not in his room. In addition, however, im-
plicature related to the evidence relation between
the clauses, contributes the conclusion that the light
in John&apos;s room is on. The point here is only that
presupposition and implicature are distinct mechan-
isms, and it is only presupposition that we are fo-
cussing on in this work.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999825370967742">
In this paper, we have shown that discourse struc-
ture need not bear the full burden of discourse se-
mantics: Part of it can be borne by other means.
This keeps discourse structure simple and able to
support a straight-forward compositional semantics.
Specifically, we have argued that the notion of ana-
phoric presupposition that was introduced by van
der Sandt (1992) to explain the interpretation of
various definite noun phrases could also be seen as
underlying the semantics of various discourse con-
nectives. Since these presuppositions are licensed
by eventualities taken to be shared knowledge, a
good source of which is the interpretation of the
discourse so far, anaphoric presupposition can be
seen as carrying some of the burden of discourse
connectivity and discourse semantics in a way that
avoids crossing dependencies.
There is, potentially, another benefit to factor-
ing the sources of discourse semantics in this way:
while cross-linguistically, inference and anaphoric
presupposition are likely to behave similarly, struc-
ture (as in syntax) is likely to be more language spe-
cific. Thus a factored approach has a better chance
of providing a cross-linguistic account of discourse
than one that relies on a single premise.
Clearly, more remains to be done. First, the ap-
proach demands a precise semantics for connect-
ives, as in the work of Grote (1998), Grote et al.
(1997), Jayez and Rossari (1998) and Lagerwerf
(1998).
Secondly, the approach demands an understand-
ing of the attentional characteristics of presupposi-
tions. In particular, preliminary study seems to sug-
gest that p-bearing elements differ in what source
can license them, where this source can be located,
and what can act as distractors for this source. In
fact, these differences seem to resemble the range of
differences in the information status (Prince, 1981;
Prince, 1992) or familiarity (Gundel et al., 1993) of
referential NPs. Consider, for example:
(11) I got in my old Volvo and set off to drive cross-
country and see as many different mountain
ranges as possible. When I got to Arkansas, for
example, I stopped in the Ozarks, although I
had to borrow another car to see them because
Volvos handle badly on steep grades.
Here, the definite NP-like presupposition of the
&amp;quot;when&amp;quot; clause (that getting to Arkansas is shared
knowledge) is licensed by driving cross-country; the
presupposition of &amp;quot;for example&amp;quot; (that stopping in
the Ozarks exemplifies some shared generalisation)
is licensed by seeing many mountain ranges, and the
presupposition of &amp;quot;another&amp;quot; (that an alternative car
to this one is shared knowledge) is licensed by my
Volvo. This suggests a corpus annotation effort for
anaphoric presuppositions, similar to ones already
in progress on co-reference.
Finally, we should show that the approach has
practical benefit for NL understanding and/or gener-
ation. But the work to date surely shows the benefit
of an approach that narrows the gap between dis-
course syntax and semantics and that of the clause.

It appears to be licenced by the causal relation that has been inferred to hold between the eventualities denoted by B and A, yielding a set of causes/reasons for A. Thus, while we do not yet have a complete characterisation of how compositional semantics, defeasible inference and anaphoric presupposition interact, Examples 2c and 2d illustrate one significant feature: Both the interpretive contribution of a structural connective like &amp;quot;because&amp;quot; and the defeasible inference stimulated by adjoining can license the anaphoric presupposition of a p-bearing element like &amp;quot;for example&amp;quot;. Recently, Asher and Lascarides (1999) have described a version of Structured Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) that also incorporates the semantic contributions of both presuppositions and assertions. In this enriched version of SDRT, a proposition can be linked to the previous discourse via multiple rhetorical relations such as background and defeasible consequence.

Sections 3 and 4 then present more detailed semantic analyses of the connectives for example and otherwise. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our arguments for the approach and suggest a program of future work. 2 Framework In previous papers (Cristea and Webber, 1997; Webber and Joshi, 1998; Webber et al., 1999), we have argued for using the more complex structures (elementary trees) of a Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) and its operations (adjoining and substitution) to associate structure and semantics with a sequence of discourse clauses.2 Here we briefly review how it works. In a lexicalized TAG, each elementary tree has at least one anchor. In the case of discourse, the anchor for an elementary tree may be a lexical item, punctuation or a feature structure that is lexically null.

In the case of discourse, the anchor for an elementary tree may be a lexical item, punctuation or a feature structure that is lexically null. The semantic contribution of a lexical anchor includes both what it presupposes and what it asserts (Stone and Doran, 1997; Stone, 1998; Stone and Webber, 1998). A feature structure anchor will either unify with a lexical item with compatible features (Knott and Mellish, 1996), yielding the previous case, or have an empty realisation, though one &apos;One may still need to admit structures having both a link back and a link forward to different clauses (Gardent, 1997). But a similar situation can occur within the clause, with relative clause dependencies — from the verb back to the relative pronoun and forward to a trace — so the possibility is not unmotivated from the perspective of syntax. 2We take this to be only the most basic level of discourse structure, producing what are essentially extended descriptions of situations/events. Discourse may be further structured with respect to speaker intentions, genre-specific presentations, etc. that maintains its semantic features.

In a lexicalized TAG, each elementary tree has at least one anchor. In the case of discourse, the anchor for an elementary tree may be a lexical item, punctuation or a feature structure that is lexically null. The semantic contribution of a lexical anchor includes both what it presupposes and what it asserts (Stone and Doran, 1997; Stone, 1998; Stone and Webber, 1998). A feature structure anchor will either unify with a lexical item with compatible features (Knott and Mellish, 1996), yielding the previous case, or have an empty realisation, though one &apos;One may still need to admit structures having both a link back and a link forward to different clauses (Gardent, 1997). But a similar situation can occur within the clause, with relative clause dependencies — from the verb back to the relative pronoun and forward to a trace — so the possibility is not unmotivated from the perspective of syntax. 2We take this to be only the most basic level of discourse structure, producing what are essentially extended descriptions of situations/events. Discourse may be further structured </context>

Thus, we suggest that the insights presented in (Asher and Lascarides, 1999) have a simpler explanation. Now, before embarking on more detailed analyses of two quite different p-bearing adverbs, we should clarify the scope of the current approach in terms of the range of p-bearing elements that can create non-structural discourse links. We believe that systematic study, perhaps starting with the 350 &amp;quot;cue phrases&amp;quot; given in (Knott, 1996, Appendix A), will show which of them use presupposition in realising discourse relations. It is likely that these might include: • temporal conjunctions and adverbial connectives presupposing an eventuality that stands in a particular temporal relation to the one currently in hand, such as &amp;quot;then&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;later&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;meanwhile&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;afterwards&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;beforehand&amp;quot;; • adverbial connectives presupposing shared knowledge of a generalisation or set, such existing SDRT analysis in response to a p-bearing element, would seem superfluous if its only role is to re-structure the right frontier to support the claimed RF</context>

(Since such a test won&apos;t distinguish p-bearing connectives such as &amp;quot;meanwhile&amp;quot; from non-relational adverbials such as &amp;quot;at dawn&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tonight&amp;quot;, the latter will have to be excluded by other means, such as the (pre-theoretical) test for relational phrases given in (Knott, 1996).) 3 For example We take &amp;quot;For example, P&amp;quot; to presuppose a quantified proposition G, and to assert that this proposition is a generalisation of the proposition it expressed by the sentence P. (We will write generalisation(E,G.)

For consistency, the semantic interpretation of the clause introduced by &amp;quot;for example&amp;quot; must make reference to the same modal base identified by the generalisation. There is more on modal bases in the next section. 4 Otherwise Our analysis of &amp;quot;otherwise&amp;quot; assumes a modal semantics broadly following Kratzer (1991) and Stone (1999), where a sentence is asserted with respect to a set of possible worlds. The semantics of &amp;quot;otherwise a&amp;quot; appeals to two sets of possible worlds. One is Wo, the set of possible worlds consistent with our knowledge of the real world. The other, Wp, is that set of possible worlds consistent with the condition C that is presupposed. a is then asserted with respect to the complement set Wo - Wp.

There is, potentially, another benefit to factoring the sources of discourse semantics in this way: while cross-linguistically, inference and anaphoric presupposition are likely to behave similarly, structure (as in syntax) is likely to be more language specific. Thus a factored approach has a better chance of providing a cross-linguistic account of discourse than one that relies on a single premise. Clearly, more remains to be done. First, the approach demands a precise semantics for connectives, as in the work of Grote (1998), Grote et al. (1997), Jayez and Rossari (1998) and Lagerwerf (1998). Secondly, the approach demands an understanding of the attentional characteristics of presuppositions. In particular, preliminary study seems to suggest that p-bearing elements differ in what source can license them, where this source can be located, and what can act as distractors for this source. In fact, these differences seem to resemble the range of differences in the information status (Prince, 1981; Prince, 1992) or familiarity (Gundel et al., 1993) of referential NPs.

The idea of combining compositional semantics with defeasible inference is not new. Neither is the idea of taking certain lexical items as anaphorically presupposing an eventuality or a set of eventualities: It is implicit in all work on the anaphoric nature of tense (cf. Partee (1984), Webber (1988), inter alia) and modality (Stone, 1999).

Recognising that this could mean multiple structural connections between clauses, Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) simply stipulates that only a single relation may hold. Moore and Pollack (1992) argue that both informational (semantic) and intentional relations can hold between clauses simultaneously and independently. This suggests that factoring the two kinds of relations might lead to a pair of structures, each still with no more than a single structural connection between any two clauses. But examples of multiple semantic relations are easy to find (Webber et al., 1999). Having structure account for all of them leads to the complexities shown in Figure 1, including the crossing dependencies shown in Fig. 1 c. These structures are no longer trees, making it difficult to define a compositional semantics. This problem would not arise if one recognised additional, non-structural means of conveying semantic relations between propositions and modal * Our thanks to Mark Steedman, Katja Markert, Gann Biemer and three ACL&apos;99 reviewers for all their useful comments. operators on propositions.
