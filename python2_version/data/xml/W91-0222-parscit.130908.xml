This paper proposes a two-level model that integrates tense and aspect information,
based on theories by both Hornstein (in the spirit of Reichenbach) and Allen, with
lexical-semantic information based on an extended version of Jackendoff&apos;s theory
that includes a verb classification system proposed by Dowty and Vendler. The
model is intended to be extensible to realms outside of the temporal domain (e.g.,
the spatial domain). The integration of tense and aspect with lexical-semantics
is especially critical in machine translation because of the lexical selection process
during generation: there is often a number of lexical connective and tense/aspect
possibilities that may be produced from a lexical semantic representation, which,
as defined in the model presented here, is largely underspecified. The use of tense
and aspect information allows the choice of target-language terms to be more finely
tuned and the combination of event structures to be more carefully constrained.

<bodyText confidence="0.999933095238095">
Recently, there has been much discussion in the literature regarding the interaction of
tense and aspect with lexical-semantics (see, for example, [Bennett et al., 1990], [Hinrichs,
1988], [Maybury, 1990], [Moens and Steedman, 1988], [Nakhimovsky, 1988], [Passonneau,
1988], [Pustejovsky, 1988, 1989], and [Tenny, 1989]). Among those who have studied the
problem of tense and/or aspect, many have taken the work of [Reichenbach, 1947] as a
starting point (see, for example, [Brent, 1988], [Moens and Steedman, 1988], [Hornstein,
1990], and [Passonneau, 1988]), while others have built on the work of [Allen, 1983, 1984]
(see, for example, [Vilain et al., 1990], and [Williams, 1990]), and still others have based
their investigation on a combination of Allen and Reichenbach&apos;s work (see, for example,
[Yip, 1985]). Among those who have studied lexical-semantic representations, many have
taken the work of [Jackendoff, 1983, 1990] as a starting point (see, for example, [Brent,
1988], [Dorr, 1989, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c], [Levin and Rappaport, 1985], and [Siskind,
1989]), while others have built on the work of [Dowty, 1979] and [Vendler, 1967] (see, for
example, [Bennett el al., 1990], [Moens and Steedman, 1988], [Nakhimovsky, 1988], and
[Passonneau, 1988]), and still others have followed [Mourelatos, 1981] and [Comrie, 1976]
(see, for example, [Bach, 1986] and [Pustejovksy, 1989]).
This paper proposes a two-level model that integrates tense and aspect information,
based on theories by both Hornstein (in the spirit of Reichenbach) and Allen, with lexical-
semantic information based on an extended version of Jackendoff&apos;s theory that includes a
verb classification system proposed by Dowty and Vendler. The model is intended to be

The integration of tense and aspect with lexical-semantics is especially critical in ma-
chine translation because of the lexical selection process during generation: there is often
a number of lexical connective and tense/aspect possibilities that may be produced from
a lexical semantic representation, which, as defined in the model presented here, is largely
underspecified. The use of tense and aspect information constrains the choice of target-
language terms, which, in turn, limits the possibilities for the generation of tense and
aspect; thus, there is a two-way communication channel between the two processes: lexi-
cal selection and tense/aspect selection.
The following section defines the dividing line between non-lexical knowledge (i.e., the
tense and aspect of the surface sentence) and lexical knowledge (i.e., the lexical tokens that
make up the surface sentence), and then discusses how these two types of knowledge are
integrated in a two-level knowledge representation model for a machine translation system.
Section 3 addresses the issue of cross-linguistic applicability of these two knowledge types,
and section 4 discusses possible extensions of temporal knowledge to the spatial domain.

2 Interaction of Tense and Aspect with Lexical Se-
mantics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973333333334">
The hypothesis proposed by [Tenny, 1987] is that the mapping between cognitive structure
and syntactic structure is governed by aspectual properties. The implication is that
lexical-semantic knowledge exists at a level that does not include aspectual or temporal
information (though these two types of knowledge may depend on each other in some
way). This is the view that is adopted here: it is assumed that lexical semantic knowledge
consists of such notions as predicate-argument structure, well-formedness conditions on
predicate-argument structures, and procedures for lexical selection of surface-sentence
tokens; all other types of knowledge must be represented at some other level.
The lexical-semantic representation that is adopted as the interlingua for the UNI-
TRAN machine translation system [Dorr, 1989, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c] is an extended ver-
sion of lexical conceptual structure (henceforth, LCS) (see [Jackendoff, 1983, 1990]). This
representation is the basis for the lexical-semantic level that is included in the knowledge
representation (KR) component (see figure 1(a)). The second level that is included in this
component is the tense and aspect structure.
In addition to the KR component, there is also a syntactic representation (SR) compo-
nent (see figure 1(b)) that is used for manipulating the syntactic structure of a sentence.
Together, the KR and SR operate bidirectionally in order to analyze the source-language
sentence and synthesize the target-language sentence. We will omit the discussion of the

SR component of UNITRAN (see, for example, [Dorr, 1987]) and will concern ourselves
only with the KR component for the purposes of this paper.
The translation example shown here illustrates the fact that the English sentence
John went to the store when Mary arrived can be translated in two ways in Spanish.
This example is addressed further throughout this paper. The remainder of this section
defines the dividing line between non-lexical knowledge (i.e., tense and aspect) and lexical
knowledge (i.e., properties of predicates and their arguments), and discusses how these
two types of knowledge might be integrated in a two-level knowledge representation model
for a machine translation system.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996777">
2.1 Tense and Aspect Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9952464">
The information required for the realization of tense and aspect is considered to be outside
of the scope of the lexical knowledge. Aspect is taken to have two components, one that
distinguishes between states and events,&apos; and the other that defines the perspective (i.e.,
simple, progressive, and perfective). (See, for example, [Dowty, 1979] and [Vendler, 1967].)
Tense, on the other hand, is taken to be the external time relationship between a given
situation and others. (See, for example, [Bennett et al., 1990]).
In the example of figure 1, the source- and target-language sentences consist of two
event structures, each of which is associated with its own tense and aspect structure. In
the case of go (John went to the store), the event is associated with the Reichenbachian
Basic Tense Structure (BTS) E,R_S, which indicates that the event is in the past.2 The
aspect of this clause is &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; (as opposed to progressive or perfective). In the case of
arrive (Mary arrived), the event is associated with the same Reichenbachian temporal
representation (E,R_S) and aspect (simple), since it too is in the simple past tense. As
for relating these two events, the approach adopted here is based on a neo-Reichenbachian
framework proposed by [Hornstein, 1990] in which the basic tense structures are organized
into a complex tense structure (CTS) as follows: the first event (i.e., the matrix clause) is
written over the BTS of the second event (i.e., the adjunct clause) and the S and R points
are then associated.3 The entire temporal/aspectual structure for this example would be
specified as follows:
&apos;We will see in section 2.2 that events are further subdivided into activities, achievements, and
accomplishments.
2 It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Reichenbachian framework, which postulates three
theoretical entities: S (the moment of speech), R (a reference point), and E (the moment of the event).
The key idea is that certain linear orderings of the three time points get grammaticalized into six basic
tenses in English. The corresponding Basic Tense Structures are:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.726995">
S,R,E present
E,R_S past
S_R,E future
E_S,R present perfect
E_R_S past perfect
S_E_R future perfect
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9830288">
The S, R, and E points may be separated by a line (in which case, the leftmost point is interpreted
as temporally earlier than the other) or by a comma (in which case, the points are interpreted as
contemporaneous).
In the general case, the association of the S and R points may force the R2 point to be moved so that
it is aligned with the RI point. The E2 point is then placed accordingly.

<bodyText confidence="0.993889444444444">
Both tense and aspect are considered to be non-lexical in that they are determined
by factors relating not to the lexical-semantic structure or particular lexical tokens of the
surface sentence, but to the temporal/aspectual features of the context surrounding the
event coupled with certain linguistically motivated constraints on the tense structure of
the sentence. In particular, it has been persuasively argued by [Hornstein, 1990] that all
sentences containing a matrix and adjunct clause are subject to a linguistic (syntactic)
constraint on tense structure regardless of the lexical tokens included in the sentence. For
example, Hornstein&apos;s linguistic Constraint on Derived Tense Structures (CDTS) requires
that the association of S and R points not involve crossover in a complex tense structure:

<equation confidence="0.914218">

aspect&apos; = simple
aspect2 = simple
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9774128125">
Here, the association of R2 and R1 violates the CDTS, thus ruling out the sentence.
Note that this linguistic constraint is a syntactic restriction on the manipulation of
tense structures, not on the temporal interpretation of tensed sentences. Thus, the con-
straint holds regardless of the lexical token that is chosen as the connective between the
two events.

while
The connecting word that relates the two events must be selected independently of the
temporal/aspectual structure associated with the sentence since the order of El and E2 in
a given CTS does not necessarily correspond to the order imposed by the interpretation of
the connective. For example, the CTS for John went to the store before Mary had arrived
is identical to the CTS for John went to the store after Mary had arrived, even though
E1 is placed linearly after E2 in both cases:

(4) E2_R2_S2

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999697285714286">
Thus, it is assumed that the knowledge required to determine the temporal/aspectual
structure associated with a sentence exists at a level that is independent from the lexical-
semantic knowledge required to select the appropriate lexical items for the surface sen-
tence.
The claim that there is a separation of temporal/aspectual knowledge from lexical-
semantic knowledge is further strengthened if one considers that a given lexical-semantic
representation may correspond to more than one tense and aspect structure, depending

<bodyText confidence="0.999304588235294">
on the context of the linguistic utterance. For example, suppose we are given the fact
that John went to the store before Mary arrived; this fact can be represented as a single
lexical-semantic structure, but it may be associated with a number of tense and aspect
structures, each of which corresponds to a different surface-sentence utterance:
John went to the store before [ Ei , Si
Mary arrived. I I
E2 , R2 S2
Ei Rl_S1
John went to the store before I I
Mary had arrived. E2 R2 S2
Ei R.3 Si

<equation confidence="0.99161075">
aspecti = simple
aspect2 = simple
aspecti = simple
aspect2 = perfective
aspecti = perfect
aspect2 = simple
aspecti = perfective
aspect2 = perfective
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863892857143">
All of these surface realizations are perfectly valid given that they are consistent with our
temporal knowledge, i.e., that the &amp;quot;going to the store&amp;quot; event occurs before the &amp;quot;arriving&amp;quot;
event. Thus, the lexical-semantic structure for these two events does not constrain the
choice of potential tense and aspect structures with which it may be associated. This
provides further evidence that temporal/aspectual knowledge exists at a level that is
independent from lexical-semantic knowledge.
Note that Hornstein&apos;s neo-Reichenbachian theory crucially relies on an asymmetry
between the matrix and adjunct clauses. Thus, there is an important distinction between
[Hornstein, 1990], in which the asymmetrical property is fundamental to the theory, and
[Yip, 1985,] in which the asymmetrical property is entirely abandoned. I suggest that
Hornstein&apos;s intuition is the correct one given that we cannot arbitrarily interchange the
matrix and adjunct clauses. For example, Yip&apos;s theory predicts that we should be able to
replace &amp;quot;El after E2&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;E2 before El,&amp;quot; which is not always the case:
John will go to the store after Mary has arrived.
*Mary has arrived before John will go to the store.
John will go to the store after Mary arrives.
*Mary arrives before John will go to the store.
Given this asymmetrical property, it would not be possible to randomly select a ma-
trix/adjunct order and an appropriate temporal connective for a surface sentence solely on
the basis of lexical information. What is needed is the temporal relation between the two
events and the constraints on their combination before it is possible to derive the surface
structure of the sentence. In addition, the aspectual information must be determined be-
fore the two events can be combined since this information will be necessary for retrieving
the tense structure (e.g., simple vs. progressive) and selecting the lexical connective (e.g.,
when vs. while). We will return to the problem of the interaction between tense/aspect
and lexical semantics in section 2.3, but first we will turn to a brief description of the
lexical-semantic representation that is used as the interlingua for the machine translation
system.

2.2 Lexical-Semantic Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999796">
Lexical-semantic structure exists at a level of knowledge representation that is distinct
from that of tense and aspect in that it encodes information about predicates and their
arguments, plus the potential realization possibilities in a given language. In terms of the
representation proposed by [Jackendoff, 1983, 1990], the lexical-semantic structures for
the two events of figure 1 would be the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9260995">
(11) (i) [E,,.., GOLoc ([Thi, John], [Position TOLOC ([Thing John], [Lo cntio &amp;COM])])]
(ii) [Event GOLOC ([Thing Mary], [p..itio. TOL. ([Thing Mary], [1,„c.ii.„ e])])]*
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984366875">
Although temporal connectives are not discussed in the theory proposed by [Jackendoff,
1983, 1990], it is assumed that these two structures are related by means of a lexical-
semantic token corresponding to the temporal relation between the two events.
As it turns out, this Jackendoff-style lexical-semantic representation is sufficient for
the purposes of producing an interlingual representation for machine translation. (See,
for example, [Dorr, 1990b, 1990c].) However, a richer lexical-semantic representation is
necessary in order to accommodate a framework in which predicates of different tempo-
ral/aspectual categories are readily distinguished. Although the lexical-semantic repre-
sentation provided by Jackendoff distinguishes between events and states, this distinction
alone is not sufficient for choosing among similar predicates that occur in different tempo-
ral/aspectual categories. In particular, events can be further subdivided into more specific
types so that non-atomic events (i.e., events that are allowed to have an extended inter-
pretation) such as destroy can be distinguished from atomic events (i.e., events that never
have an extended interpretation) such as obliterate. This distinction is not captured in
Jackendoff&apos;s framework, but it is a crucial distinction given that these two similar words
cannot be interchangeably used in all temporal/aspectual contexts:
</bodyText>

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999472818181818">
Such distinctions are omitted in [Yip, 1985], where all events are merged under the single
heading dynamic, and a constraint on temporal interpretations is applied uniformly across
all verbs in this category. However, as we have seen above in example (12), it cannot be the
case that the temporal interpretations of all dynamic verbs adhere to the same constraints
given that the temporal/aspectual distributions are not identical.
A number of lexical-semantic representations have been proposed that more readily
accommodate temporal/aspectual distinctions. In particular, [Dowty, 1979] and [Vendler,
1967] have proposed an aspectually oriented lexical-semantic structure that provides a
four-way classification system for verbs: states, activities, achievements, and accomplish-
ments, each of which has a different degree of telicity (i.e., culminated vs. nonculminated),
and/or atomicity (i.e., point vs. extended).5 A similar scheme has been suggested by

5 Dowty&apos;s version of this classification collapses achievements and accomplishments into a single event
type called a transition, which covers both the point and extended versions of the event type. The
rationale for this move is that all events have some duration, even in the case of so-called punctual
events, depending on the granularity of time involved. (See [Passonneau, 1988] for an adaptation of this
scheme as implemented in the PUNDIT system.) For the purposes of this discussion, we will maintain
the distinction between achievements and accomplishments.

[Bach, 1986] and [Pustejoyksy, 1989] (following [Mourelatos, 1981] and [Comrie, 1976]) in
which actions are classified into states, processes, and events.
In light of these observations, the lexical-semantic structure adopted for UNITRAN
is an augmented form of Jackendoff&apos;s representation in which events are distinguished
from states (as before), but they are further subdivided into activities, achievements, and
accomplishments. The subdivision is achieved by means of three features proposed by
[Bennett et al., 1990] following the framework of [Moens and Steedman, 1988] (in the
spirit of [Dowty, 1979] and [Vendler, 1967]): ±dynamic (i.e., events vs. states, as in the
Jackendoff framework), ±telic (i.e., culminative events (transitions) vs. nonculminative
events (activities)), and ±atomic (i.e., point events vs. extended events). This featural
system is imposed on top of the lexical-semantic framework proposed by Jackendoff. For
example, the primitive GO would be annotated with the features [+d,+t,-a] for the verb
destroy, but [-Fd,+t,+a] for the verb obliterate, thus providing the appropriate distinction
for cases such as (12).
Figure 2 relates the four types of lexical-semantic frameworks outlined above. Note
that the system of features proposed by [Bennett et al., 1990] and [Moens and Steedman,
1988] provide the finest tuning given that five distinct categories of predicates are identi-
fied by the feature settings. (This system is essentially equivalent to the Dowty/Vendler
proposal, but features are used to distinguish the categories more precisely.) In the
next section, we will see how the tense and aspect structure described in section 2.1
and the lexical-semantic representation described in this section are combined to provide
the framework for generating a target-language surface form.

2.3 Combining Tense/Aspect with Lexical Semantics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996921181818182">
The tense/aspect component of UNITRAN operates in tandem with the lexical-semantic
component in order to provide a surface form that corresponds to the interlingual repre-
sentation. Tense information is linked with the lexical-semantic representation by means
of Allen&apos;s temporal relations.6 These temporal relations are assumed to be determined
from the context in which the source-language sentence is uttered or, perhaps, from some
knowledge source such as a database with temporal information.
For example, if we determine from a knowledge source that event E1 John went to the
store and event E2 Mary arrived have both occurred in the past, then the time of the
61t is assumed that the reader is familiar with Allen&apos;s 13 notational relations: &gt; (after), &lt; (before),
(equal), m (meets), mi (is met by), o (overlaps), oi (is overlapped by), d (during), di (contains), s (starts),
si (is started by), f (finishes), and fi (is finished by).

linguistic utterance S is after the two event times.&apos; This means that the only possible
BTS&apos;s (for both E1 and E2) are: E,R_S (past), E_S,R (present perfect), and E_R_S
(past perfect). In each of these three cases, the event time E and the speech time S
are separated by (at least one) line, thus providing a temporal interpretation in which E
occurs before S.
Figure 3 illustrates the combination of the two BTS&apos;s into nine possible complex tense
structures. (One component of the aspectual representation, simple vs. perfect, is included
as well.) The CDTS rules out four of the nine possibilities leaving the following five cases:8

<bodyText confidence="0.999943333333333">
Now that the constraint proposed by Hornstein has pared down the possibilities for the
tense combinations, we can further constrain the choices of surface sentences by selecting
the most accurate description of the temporal relation between the two events for the
connective when. Suppose we have the additional information from the knowledge source
that the &amp;quot;going to the store&amp;quot; event occurs before the &amp;quot;arriving&amp;quot; event; in terms of Allen&apos;s
notation, this would be specified as E1 &lt; E2. The two sentences that guarantee this
relation are (16) and (17). We can ensure that only these two realizations are selected
for the when connective by using the El &lt; E2 relation as an index into a table that
associates the aspectual information of the two events with the when connective. The
aspectual information in this table includes the featural specifications (i.e., ±dynamic,
±telic, ±atomic) for the two lexical-semantic tokens (i.e., G0Loc in both cases) as well
as the perspective of the two events (i.e., simple, progressive, or perfective). A portion of
such a table is shown in figure 4. From this table we see that there are only two possible
aspectual realizations for the two GOL,,c events in the current example: since both events
are associated with the features [+d,-Ft,-a] and since there are only five legal tense/aspect
combinations to choose from, the only admissible aspectual realizations are a perfective
matrix clause with a simple adjunct clause, or a perfective matrix clause with a perfective
adjunct clause. Thus, sentences (16) and (17) are selected as legal possibilities for the
surface sentence.
Both [Brent, 1990] and [Yip, 19851 have attempted to compile a table along the lines
of the one shown in figure 4. However, in the case of Yip, the perfective aspect is omitted,
thus excluding sentences such as (16) and (17) as possible surface sentence forms. In the
case of Brent, the table is calculated irrespective of the lexical connective, thus giving
rise to spurious temporal assignments such as Ei = E2 for the temporal interpretation
of sentences such as John went to the store before Mary arrived. Furthermore, only
punctual events are considered; interval events are entirely ignored in Brent&apos;s analysis
of tempoial connectives. Neither Yip nor Brent take telicity or atomicity into account
in the construction of the connective table. However, as we will see in section 3, these
features are important for providing a cross-linguistically applicable framework for tense
and aspect in a machine translation model.

Now that we have looked at the constraints on the choice of temporal/aspectual real-
izations for the matrix and adjunct clauses with respect to the when temporal connective,
there is still the question of how the temporal connective is selected in the first place. For
example, without any additional information, we are unable to determine, unambiguously,
the relation between the clauses of the sentences shown in figure 1:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.6550128">
[[Event GOLoc ((Thing John], [Position TOLOC ([Thing John], [Locetion
Store)M
[Event GOLoc ([Thing Mary], [Position TOLoc ([Thing Mary], [Loestion e])])]
Potential Temporal Relations : &gt;,=, mi,
(18)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997744">
In particular, the connective when may correspond to any of the three relations (i.e., &gt;,
=, or mi) depending on the intended temporal interpretation of the associated events.
The mapping between temporal relations and temporal connectives is a problem in
both directions: on the one hand, connectives that are in a one-to-many relation with
Allen&apos;s temporal relations (e.g., when, which corresponds to &gt;, =, and mi) create a prob-
lem for the analysis of the source-language sentence; on the other hand, the temporal
relations that are in a one-to-many relation with potential temporal connectives (e.g.,
the &gt;, which corresponds to after and when) create a problem for the generation of the
target-language sentence. The next section addresses how to control this abundance of
selection possibilities.

The when construction has been studied extensively in the literature. In particular, it has
been noticed that the aspectual properties of the clauses conjoined by when often change
the temporal meaning of the entire sentence. (See [Moens and Steedman, 1988] and [Yip,
1985] among others.) Allen&apos;s temporal logic falls short in this regard: it does not capture
well-known patterns of tense implications based on aspectual distinctions.9
Some examples of when constructions (taken from [Yip, 1985]) are shown here:1° (Note
that the word when potentially maps to more than one temporal relation if we adopt
Allen&apos;s framework.)

9 An example of a tense implication that is not captured in Allen&apos;s approach is that a progressive form
of a process entails the negation of the perfect form (e.g., John is building a house implies John has not
built the house). See [Yip, 1985] for a description of other tense implications that are not captured in
Allen&apos;s approach.
&apos;°This is a modified version of the enumerated constructions in [Yip, 1985]. Certain changes have been
made to accommodate differences in interpretative judgments (by native English speakers) for the data
given in Yip&apos;s presentation.

As it turns out, the temporal relations enumerated in figure 4 for the when connective
cover the cases shown here, plus many others that are not addressed by Yip. There are
two important advantages to using the featural scheme of figure 4 over the less specific
scheme of [Yip, 1985]: (1) it provides a more precise specification of states and events;
and (2) it includes temporal/aspectual information that is important for the realization
of other types of surface-structure constituents (besides temporal connectives) such as the
number of a verbal object. We will return to this second point shortly.
Although the when construction has been studied extensively, it has not been exam-
ined in the context of machine translation. In particular, the question of whether the
tense/aspect theories of Allen, Bennett, et al., Dowty, Reichenbach, Vendler, and others
can be combined to provide a cross-linguistic account for the selection of tense/aspect
and temporal connectives such as when (e.g., in an interlingual translation model) has
not been addressed.
Machine translation provides an appropriate testbed for trying out such theories. The
problem of lexical selection during generation of the target language is the most crucial
issue in this regard. For example, one must choose between the lexical tokens cuando
and a/ when generating an equivalent Spanish temporal connective for the following two
English sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.967723">
(23) (i) John went to the store when Mary arrived.
(ii) John had gone to the store when Mary arrived.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.934736692307692">
In the case of (23)(i), there are two possible translations, one that uses the connective
cuando, and one that uses the connective a/:
(24) (i) Juan fue a la tienda cuando Maria Hegel.
(ii) Juan fue a la tienda al llegar Maria.
Either one of these sentences is an acceptable translation for (23)(i). However, the same
is not true of (23)(0:11
(25) (i) Juan habia ido a la tienda cuando Maria Hee).
(ii) Juan habia ido a la tienda al llegar Maria.
Sentence (25)(i) is an acceptable translation of (23)(ii), but (25)(ii) does not mean the
same thing as (23)(ii). This second sentence implies that John has already gone to the
store and come back, which is not the preferred reading.
Currently research is under way to enumerate all of the English temporal connectives
(taken from Webster&apos;s on-line dictionary) in order to establish an association between
these connectives and the aspectual interpretation for the matrix and adjunct events (in
the manner shown in figure 4). These tables vary from language to language, but the
procedure for choosing temporal connectives applies cross-linguistically once the tables
for each language are compiled. For example, the table for the Spanish connective a/
would be similar to the table for the English connective when in figure 4 except that the
specification for the &amp;quot;&lt;&amp;quot; relation would require the matrix event to have the +telic feature
(i.e., the matrix action must reach a culmination). Thus, the full type entry under the
matrix clause for the word a/ would be [±d,-Ft,±a]. This would account for the distinction
between cuando and at in sentences (25)(i) and (25)(ii) above.
Space limitations do not permit the enumeration of the other temporal connective
tables. Some examples of connectives that are currently being compiled into tables are:
after, as soon as, at the moment that, before, between, during, since, so long as, until,
11I am indebted to Jorge Lobo for pointing this out to me.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.98725">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.994575941176471">
while, etc. It is intended that these tables are to be used both for the selection of temporal
connectives during the generation process (for which the relevant index into the tables
would be the temporal relation and the lexical-semantic types encoded in the interlingua)
and for temporal interpretation during the analysis process (for which the relevant index
into the tables would be the lexical-semantic types and aspectual perspectives associated
with the source-language sentence). The selection of a temporal connective, then, is simply
a table look-up procedure based on the type of the events and the temporal interpretation
that holds between the events. For example, if we had a [+d,-t,-a] event El (e.g., run)
and a [+d,+t,+a] event E2 (e.g., arrive), and if we knew that the temporal relation
between EI and E2 was m, then searching the when table would fail, but searching the
until table would succeed, thus allowing a sentence such as John ran until Mary arrived
to be generated.
As mentioned earlier, the featural system outlined above provides a framework that is
appropriate not only for the realization of temporal connectives, but also for the realization
of other types of temporal/aspectual information. For example, the sentence I stabbed
Mary could be realized in at least two ways in Spanish:
(26) (i) Juan le dio puiialadas a Marla
(ii) Juan le dio una purialada a Maria
Both of these sentences translate literally to &amp;quot;John gave stab wound(s) to Mary.&amp;quot; However,
the first sentence is the repetitive version of the action (i.e., there were multiple stab
wounds), whereas the second sentence is the non-repetitive version of the action (i.e., there
was only one stab wound). This distinction is characterized by means of the atomicity
feature. In (26)(i), the event is associated with the features H-d,+t,-a], whereas, in (26)(ii)
the event is associated with the features [-I-d,+t,-Fa]. According to [Bennett et al., 1990] (in
the spirit of [Moens and Steedman, 1980, predicates are allowed to undergo an atomicity
&amp;quot;coercion&amp;quot; in which an inherently non-atomic predicate (such as dio) may become atomic
under certain conditions. These conditions are language-specific in nature, i.e., they
depend on the lexical-semantic structure of the predicate in question. Given the featural
scheme that is imposed on top of the lexical-semantic framework, it is easy to specify
coercion functions for each language. For example, the atomicity function for the stab
example would specify that a singular NP verbal object maps a [-i-d,-a] predicate into a
[+d,+a] predicate i.e., a non-atomic event becomes atomic if it is associated with a singular
NP object. Thus, the notion of feature-based coercion is cross-linguistically applicable,
providing a useful foundation for a model of interlingual machine translation.

4 Extension of the Temporal/Aspectual Framework
to the Spatial Domain
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996475">
In addition to investigating the cross-linguistic applicability of the temporal/aspectual
framework in the context of machine translation, current research is under way to extend
the representation to the spatial domain. This possibility has also been investigated
by [Mukerjee and Joe, 1990], in which the interval logic model of [Allen, 1983] has been
extended to be applicable to the spatial domain. For example, the one-dimensional interval
relation C(++)B specifies that the spatial interval C is, in some sense, &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; the spatial
interval B. This relation is analogous to Allen&apos;s temporal relation C &gt; B, which specifies
that the temporal interval C occurs after the temporal interval B. Other spatial relations

that are currently under investigation are: above, before, behind, between, beyond, down,
following, next to, off, on, to, under, within, etc. It is expected that the principles that
govern the relation of temporal primitives to lexical items will hold for analogous primitives
in the spatial field; experiments are currently being conducted to test this hypothesis.

5 Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977777777778">
This paper has examined a two-level knowledge representation model for machine transla-
tion that integrates the tense and aspect information based on theories by both Hornstein
(in the spirit of Reichenbach) and Allen with lexical-semantic information based on the-
ories by Jackendoff in the spirit of Dowty and Vendler. We have examined the question
of cross-linguistic applicability showing that the integration of tense and aspect with
lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine translation when there are a number of
temporal/aspectual possibilities that may be generated from a lexical semantic represen-
tation. Finally, we have discussed the possibility of extending the temporal notation to
the spatial domain.
