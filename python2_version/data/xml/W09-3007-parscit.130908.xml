We present two modules for the recogni-

The Temporal Expression Tagger we have
developed is based on a large coverage
cascade of finite state transducers and our
Event Tagger on a set of simple heuris-

<bodyText confidence="0.999859448275862">
TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) is a specifica-
tion language for the annotation and normaliza-
tion of temporal information in natural language
texts. The annotation scheme allows for the anno-
tation of events (&lt;EVENT&gt;), the tagging of temporal
expressions and the normalization of their values
(&lt;TIMEX3&gt;), as well as the annotation of tempo-
ral, aspectual and subordinating relations which
may exist among them (&lt;TLINK&gt;, &lt;ALINK&gt; and
&lt;SLINK&gt;, respectively). The linguistic markers of
these relations can also be marked up (&lt;SIGNAL&gt;).
A set of resources, including automatic and man-
ual annotation tools and several reference corpora
have been developed around the TimeML lan-
guage. Evita (Saur´ı et al., 2005) is an applica-
tion for automatically recognizing and annotating
events in texts, based primarily on symbolic meth-
ods and linguistic data (input is a chunked text),
although with some integration of statistical data.
Its creators report precision of 74.03% and recall
of 87.31% for an overall F-score of 80.12% for
the task of event identification. GUTime (Mani
and Wilson, 2000) annotates temporal expressions
according to the TimeML schema and normalizes
their values. The system achieves F-scores of 85%
and 82% for identification and normalization of
temporal expressions, respectively. Further infor-
mation is available on the TimeML project web-
site1.

(Parent et al., 2008) provide the description and
evaluation of a system for the TimeML annota-
tion of events and temporal expressions in French
texts. The processing of temporal expressions is
carried out on a text having undergone a part-of-
speech tagging, morphological analysis and shal-
low syntactic analysis. The system functions by
application of a cascade of 90 rules applied over
20 levels. Contrary to the Evita system developed
for English, the event detection module relies on a
full dependency parse as input for the event recog-
nition task. The authors claim an advantage over
chunker-based approaches with respect to the an-
notation of markable adjectives due to the fact that
the dependency relation between copula verb and
predicative adjective is available. The authors pro-
vide evaluation results according to grammatical
category over a development corpus, made up of
35 biographical texts and 22 sports articles, and an
evaluation (“unseen”) corpus, consisting of an un-
specified number of news articles from the website
of the ´Ecole Polytechnique de Montr´eal. The eval-
uation results, by grammatical category and global
figures, are given in Table 1.

in the annotation of event nominals. Adjectives
are relatively well processed over the development
corpus, but no adjectives were annotated by the
human annotator in the evaluation corpus, so no
results were calculated. As for the annotation of
temporal expressions, precision is 83% and recall
79%, for an F-score of 81% over an evaluation cor-
pus containing 544 human-annotated temporal ex-
pressions and an F-score of 50% for the normal-
ization of values. These figures are comparable to

3 Annotation Modules
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977">
In this section, we describe an annotation system,
similar to that of (Parent et al., 2008) described
above, although based on a rich cascade of finite
state transducers and a shallow syntactic analysis,
as opposed to a full dependency parse. The sys-
tem is made up principally of two modules, the
first tagging temporal expressions (section 3.1),
the second identifying and annotating event ex-
pressions (section 3.2).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99767">
3.1 Temporal Expression Tagger
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998">
This module carries out the tagging and nor-
malization of temporal expressions. The mod-
ule consists of a large-coverage set of finiste
state transducers developed with the Unitex2 cor-
pus processor. The transducers in this large-
coverage grammar, applied to raw text, recognize
patterns of dates, times, duration and frequency
and tag expressions with the appropriately typed
&lt;TIMEX3&gt;. A transducer matching expressions not
to be marked up was also created. This trans-
ducer tags with the label &lt;GARBAGE&gt; expressions
such as phone numbers, which could otherwise
match numerical dates. The ambiguous word ´et´e
(been/summer), when preceded by an adverb or
the auxiliary verb avoir is tagged as &lt;GARBAGE&gt;,
as it has its verb rather than noun reading in this
context. Other expressions tagged as &lt;GARBAGE&gt;
include the common expression les 35 heures (the
French 35 hour week) and names of streets con-
taining a date, such as la place du 13 Mai, etc.
The normalization script, written in Perl, calcu-
lates the standard values of temporal expressions,
including underspecified deictic expressions, and

removes annotations on items marked &lt;GARBAGE&gt;.
The script consists of a set of substitution func-
tions for each type of temporal expression tagged
by the transducers. Each function converts the
content of the expression into a TimeML stan-
dard value and inserts it in the value attribute
of each &lt;TIMEX3&gt; tag. This module is available
for download at http://www.linguist.univ-paris-
diderot.fr/˜abittar. This approach differs from that
of (Parent et al., 2008) in that it relies almost en-
tirely on lexical processing.
An evaluation was carried out on a subset of the
corpus used to evaluate the similar module de-
scribed in section 2. Our corpus consists of the 45
news articles from the Agence France Press used
in the training and test sets described by (Parent
et al., 2008). Figures for the evaluation are given
in Table 2. The column labeled “Loose” repre-
sents the number of matches which cover an in-
complete span of the expression, for example un
mois (one month) instead of un mois et demi (a
month and a half). The column “Strict” is for ex-
act matches. The “Value” column represents the
correctly normalized values for the temporal ex-
pressions detected, calculated over strict matches.

<bodyText confidence="0.999568555555556">
These figures are much in line with those of
the system described in (Parent et al., 2008).
Performance is slightly lower on loose matches
(F-score 87.1 versus 91.0), but we achieve better
results on strict matches (F-score 83.0 versus
81.0). This could be explained by the fact that we
did not develop our grammar on the same type
of source text, but shows that the grammar has
a good coverage of the variants of each type of
expression.
Sources of noise include age values tagged as
durations, e.g. M. Dupont, 58 ans (Mr. Dupont, 58
years old) (11 errors), and numerical values taken
to be years, e.g. l’ast´eroide 2001 UU92 (Asteroid
2001 UU92) (8 errors). Silence occurs mostly
on coordinated date expressions or sequences,
e.g. les 4, 5 et 6 f´evrier (the 4th, 5th and 6th
of February) (11 errors) or expressions taking a

“vague” normalized value, e.g. dans le pass´e (in
the past) (15 errors).
Results for the normalization of values for tem-
poral expressions are practically identical to the
other system for French. The majority of errors
produced by our system (97 out of 167) are due
to the fact that our normalization script does not
yet fully deal with underspecified weekday ex-
pressions, such as jeudi soir (Thursday evening).
In the hand-annotated corpus these expressions
are fully resolved, with year, month and day
values specified, e.g. 2002-01-15TEV, whereas
we provide a correct, but not completely resolved
value, which specifies the day of the week, e.g.
2002-WXX-4TEV. Excluding this difference in
processing boosts precision to 73.6 and recall
to 60.1 (F-score 66.85) for the normalization
of values. We are currently working on fully
normalizing these values.

3.2 Event Tagger
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99721">
This module tags event expressions with the
&lt;EVENT&gt; tag and classifies the events according
to the ontology defined for TimeML. It also de-
tects negative polarity contexts, as well as any as-
pectual or modal properties of certain verbal con-
structions. Input is a text having undergone part-
of-speech tagging, an inflectional morphological
analysis and shallow syntactic analysis, carried
out by Macaon, a modular processing pipeline for
French3. The Event tagger consists of several lev-
els of processing - a layer of lexical processing, ba-
sically a lexical lookup for nouns and verb classes,
and a layer of contextual processing consisting
in the application of heuristics for detecting and
eliminating event candidates and classifying them.
This module relies on certain lexical resources.
For the detection of event nominals, a lexicon con-
taining nouns with at least one event interpretation
is used. Many of the entries in this lexicon are am-
biguous as they may also have a non-event inter-
pretation. For example, repas (meal) has an object
interpretation as well as an event reading. This
highlights the need for disambiguation of nomi-
nals. The noun lexicon is based on the VerbAc-
tion lexicon (Hathout et al., 2002) which provided
9 200 unique deverbal noun lemmas. We fur-
ther enriched the lexicon through semi-automated

search engine queries, such as X a eu lieu (X took
place) and lors du/de la/des X (during the X),
where X is likely to be an event nominal. An ini-
tial application of this method yielded 769 unique
noun lemmas which were not in VerbAction -
mostly rare or non-deverbal nouns, such as antico-
aguloth´erapie (anticoagulation therapy) and an-
niversaire (birthday). The noun lexicon is of com-
parable size to that used in Evita.
We created by hand a verb lexicon which is used to
perform classification of verbal events. It contains
200 lemmas for verbs in 6 of the 7 TimeML event
classes4. Verbs were initially added to the lexi-
con by translating those proposed in the TimeML
classifcation for English. The list of verbs was en-
riched by querying the dictionary of synonyms at
the Universit´e de Caen5. The lexicon is small for
the time being and will need to be increased to en-
sure better coverage for classification. Like the
noun lexicon, the lexicon of verbs contains am-
biguities as certain verbs may belong to different
classes or may not have an event reading in cer-
tain contexts. For example, the verb expliquer (to
explain) belongs to the class REPORTING when it
introduces a complementizer phrase in que (that)
headed by an event (Max a expliqu´e qu’il avait
commis une erreur - Maca explained that he had
made a mistake). This is the class attributed by
the lexicon. However, when it has a human sub-
ject and an event in object position (Le manager a
expliqu´e le renouvellemetn de l’´equipe - the man-
ager explained the renewal of the team), it must be
annotated with the class I ACTION. Finally, if this
verb has events in both subject and object position
(Le r´echauffement climatique explique la fonte des
calottes glaci`eres - global warming explains the
melting of the ice caps), it is to be annotated with
the class CAUSE. The system is thus confronted
with the non-trivial problem of word sense disam-
biguation to identify the correct readings of nouns
and verbs in the text. Initially, we tackle this prob-
lem for verbs with a number of heuristics, applied
to local chunk context, for each of the TimeML
verb classes in the lexicon. A total of 16 heuristics
are used for choosing candidates for markup with
the &lt;EVENT&gt; tag and 30 heuristics for classifying
the events and determining values for the aspect,
modality and polarity attributes. For example,
in the case of the verb expliquer given above, the

<bodyText confidence="0.99658816">
heuristics include a search for the complementizer
que in the chunk after the verb and a search for
an event nominal chunk directly to the left of the
verb chunk (approximation of subject position).
Further heuristics are used to eliminate verbs and
nouns which do not have an event reading. For ex-
ample, event nominal chunks which do not have
a determiner, such as in prisonier de guerre (pris-
oner of war), are not considered as candidates as
they do not denote event instances, but rather event
types, and cannot be attributed a specific temporal
localisation. A set of heuristics is used to detect
predicative adjectives, like in Jean ´etait malade
(Jean was sick), which are potential candidates for
markup with the &lt;EVENT&gt; tag. For example, if the
preceding verb is a copula, the adjective is flagged
as a markable.
To evaluate our event tagger we used a corpus of
30 hand-annotated news articles from the newspa-
per Le Monde. The corpus was split into a devel-
opment set of 20 documents (11 224 tokens, 1 187
EVENT tags) and a test set of 10 documents (5 916
tokens, 583 EVENT tags). Overall, the corpus con-
tains 1 205 verbal, 471 nominal, 62 adjectival and
18 prepositional phrase EVENT tags.

The results shown in Table 3 are fairly homoge-
nous over both the development and test sets. The
detection of event verbs performs slightly lower
than that of the other system for French, although
the evaluations were carried out on different cor-
pora. For nominals, our system makes a vast im-
provement on the performance of the other sys-
tem described in this paper (an F-score of 74.5
versus 54.2 over the respective test sets). The
large-coverage lexicon of event nominals allows
for a good recall, although precision remains low
as more disambiguation is required to filter out
nominals with non-event readings. Performance
on adjectival events is lower than the other system,
although not as bad as might have been expected.
This is likely due to the difference in depth of syn-
tactic analysis available to each system.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997545454545">
We have presented a comparative evaluation of
two systems for the TimeML annotation of events
and temporal expressions in French texts. Results
show that a lexical approach to annotating tempo-
ral expressions performs generally just as well as
an approach based on a shallow syntactic analy-
sis. For event detection, the benefits of a full de-
pendency parse are apparent, especially for the de-
tection of markable adjectives, although compara-
ble performance can be obtained with a chunked
text as input. The benefits of a large-coverage lex-
icon for identifying event nominals are evident,
although without effective disambiguation tech-
niques precision remains very low. This is one
point which requires particular attention and more
elaborate guidelines for the annotation of event
nominals would be of great value. Figures from
the evaluation give a rough indication of perfor-
mance across systems, however, a validated refer-
ence corpus for French is yet to be developed in or-
der to give more meaningful comparisons. These
are issues we are currently addressing.

Adjectives are relatively well processed over the development corpus, but no adjectives were annotated by the human annotator in the evaluation corpus, so no results were calculated. As for the annotation of temporal expressions, precision is 83% and recall 79%, for an F-score of 81% over an evaluation corpus containing 544 human-annotated temporal expressions and an F-score of 50% for the normalization of values. These figures are comparable to those cited for GUTime for English. 3 Annotation Modules In this section, we describe an annotation system, similar to that of (Parent et al., 2008) described above, although based on a rich cascade of finite state transducers and a shallow syntactic analysis, as opposed to a full dependency parse. The system is made up principally of two modules, the first tagging temporal expressions (section 3.1), the second identifying and annotating event expressions (section 3.2). 3.1 Temporal Expression Tagger This module carries out the tagging and normalization of temporal expressions. The module consists of a large-coverage set of finiste state transducers developed with the Unitex2 corpus processor. The transducers in this largecoverage grammar</context>

The script consists of a set of substitution functions for each type of temporal expression tagged by the transducers. Each function converts the content of the expression into a TimeML standard value and inserts it in the value attribute of each &lt;TIMEX3&gt; tag. This module is available for download at http://www.linguist.univ-parisdiderot.fr/˜abittar. This approach differs from that of (Parent et al., 2008) in that it relies almost entirely on lexical processing. An evaluation was carried out on a subset of the corpus used to evaluate the similar module described in section 2. Our corpus consists of the 45 news articles from the Agence France Press used in the training and test sets described by (Parent et al., 2008). Figures for the evaluation are given in Table 2. The column labeled “Loose” represents the number of matches which cover an incomplete span of the expression, for example un mois (one month) instead of un mois et demi (a month and a half). The column “Strict” is for exact matches. </context>
