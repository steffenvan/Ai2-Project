This paper presents the HIT_CITYU systems
in Semeval-2 Task 18, namely, disambiguat-
ing sentiment ambiguous adjectives. The base-
line system (HITSZ_CITYU_3) incorporates
bi-gram and n-gram collocations of sentiment
adjectives, and other context words as features
in a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier. To enhance the baseline system, col-
location set expansion and characteristics
learning based on word similarity and semi-
supervised learning are investigated, respec-
tively. The final system (HITSZ_CITYU_1/2)
combines collocations, context words and
neighboring sentence sentiment in a two-class
SVM classifier to determine the polarity of
sentiment adjectives. The final systems
achieved 0.957 and 0.953 (ranked 1st and 2nd)
macro accuracy, and 0.936 and 0.933 (ranked
2nd and 3rd) micro accuracy, respectively.

1 Introduction

Sentiment analysis is always puzzled by the con-
text-dependent sentiment words that one word
brings positive, neutral or negative meanings in
different contexts. Hatzivassiloglou and
Mckeown (1997) predicated the polarity of ad-
jectives by using the pairs of adjectives linked by
consecutive or negation conjunctions. Turney
and Littman (2003) determined the polarity of
sentiment words by estimating the point-wise
mutual information between sentiment words
and a set of seed words with strong polarity. An-
dreevskaia and Bergler (2006) used a Sentiment
Tag Extraction Program to extract sentiment-
bearing adjectives from WordNet. Esuli and Se-
basian (2006) studied the context-dependent sen-
timent words in WordNet but ignored the in-

stances in real context. Wu et al. (2008) applied
collocation plus a SVM classifier in Chinese sen-
timent adjectives disambiguation. Xu et al. (2008)
proposed a semi-supervised learning algorithm to
learn new sentiment word and their context-
dependent characteristics.
Semeval-2 Task 18 is designed to provide a
common framework and dataset for evaluating
the disambiguation techniques for Chinese sen-
timent adjectives. The HITSZ_CITYU group
submitted three runs corresponding to one base-
line system and one improved systems (two runs).
The baseline system (HITSZ_CITYU_3) is
based on collocations between sentiment words
and their targets as well as their context words.
For the ambiguous adjectives, 412 positive and
191 negative collocations are built from a 100-
million-word corpus as the seed collocation set.
Using the context words of seed collocations as
features, a one-class SVM classifier is trained in
the baseline system. Using HowNet-based word
similarity as clue, the seed collocations are ex-
panded to improve the coverage of collocation-
based technique. Furthermore, a semi-supervised
learning algorithm is developed to learn new col-
locations between sentiment words and their tar-
gets from raw corpus. Finally, the inner sentence
features, such as collocations and context words,
and the inter sentence features, i.e. neighboring
sentence sentiments, are incorporated to deter-
mine the polarity of ambiguous adjectives. The
improved systems (HITSZ_CITYU_1/2)
achieved 0.957 and 0.953 macro accuracy
(ranked 1st and 2nd) and 0.936 and 0.933 micro
accuracy (ranked 2nd and 3rd), respectively. This
result shows that collocation, context-words and
neighboring sentence sentiment are effective in
sentiment adjectives disambiguation.

2 Collocation Extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892055555556">
A lexical statistics-based collocation extraction
subsystem is developed to identify both the bi-
gram and n-gram collocations of sentiment ad-
jectives. This subsystem is based on our previous
research on Chinese collocation extraction. It
recognizes the co-occurring words of a headword
as collocations which have co-occurrence fre-
quency significance among all co-occurring
words and co-occurrence position significance
among all co-occurring positions.
For a sentiment adjective, noted as whead, any
word within the [-5,+5] context window is a co-
word, denoted as wco-i for 1≤ i ≤ k, where k is the
total number of different co-words of whead.
BI-Strength(whead,wco-i) between a head word
whead and a co-word w co-i (i=1, to k) is designed
to measure the co-occurrence frequency signifi-
cance as follows:

where, fmax(whead) , fmin(whead) and f(whead)are the
highest, lowest and average co-occurrence fre-
quencies among all the co-words of whead,, re-
spectively; fmax(wco-i), fmin(wcoi) and f(wco−i) are
respectively the highest, lowest and average co-
occurrence frequencies of the co-words for wco-i.
The value of BI-Strength(whead wco-j) ranges from
-1 to 1, and a larger value means a stronger asso-
ciation. Suppose f(whead,wco-i, m) is the frequency
that wco-i co-occurs with whead at position m(–
5&lt;=m&lt;=5). The BI-Spread(whead,wco-i) is de-
signed to characterizes the significance that wco-i

3 The Baseline System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981166868421053">
The baseline system incorporates collocation and
context words as features in a one-class SVM
classifier. It consists of two steps:
STEP 1: To match a test instance containing
seed collocation set. If the instance cannot be
matched by any collocations, go to STEP 2.
STEP 2: Use a trained classifier to indentify
the sentiment of the word.
The collocations of 14 testing sentiment adjec-
tives are extracted from a 100-million-word cor-
pus. Collocations with obvious and consistent
sentiment are manually identified. 412 positive
and 191 negative collocations are established as
the seed collocation set.
We think that the polarity of a word can be de-
termined by exploiting the association of its co-
occurring words in sentence. We assume that, the
two instances of an ambiguous sentiment adjec-
tives that have similar neighboring nouns may
have the same polarity. Gamon and Aue (2005)
made an assumption to label sentiment terms.
We extract 13,859 sentences containing collo-
cations between negative adjective and targets
in seed collocation set or collocations between
ambiguous adjective and negative modifier
449
coverage is low. It is observed that the seed col-
location set covers 17.54% of sentences contain-
ing the ambiguous adjectives while the colloca-
tions between adjective and negative modifier
covers only 11.28%. Therefore, we expand the
sentiment adjective-target collocation set based
on word similarity and a semi-supervised learn-
ing algorithm orderly. We then incorporate both
inner-sentence features (collocations, context
words, etc.) and inter-sentence features in the
improved systems for sentiment adjectives dis-
ambiguation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9978885">
4.1 Collocation Set Expansion based on
Word Similarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999523">
First, we expand the seed collocation set on the
target side. The words strongly similar to known
targets are identified by using a word similarity
calculation package, provided by HowNet (a
Chinese thesaurus). Once these words co-occur
with adjective within a context window more
often than a threshold, they are appended to seed
collocation set. For example, “低-技能(low ca-
pacity)”is expanded from a seed collocation “低
-能力 (low capacity)”.
Second, we manually identify the words hav-
ing the same “trend” as the testing adjectives.
For example, “上升 increase” is selected as a
same-trend word of “高 high”. The collocations
of “上升” are extracted from corpus. Its collo-
cated targets with confident and consistent sen-
timent are appended to the sentiment collocation
set of “高” if they co-occurred with “高” more
than a threshold. In this way, some low-
frequency sentiment collocation can be obtained.

4.2 Semi-supervised Learning of Sentiment
Collocations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983833333334">
A semi-supervised learning algorithm is devel-
oped to further expand the collocation seed set,
which is described as follows. (It is revised based
on our previous research (Xu et al. 2008). The
basic assumption here is that, the sentiment of a
sentence having ambiguous adjectives can be
estimated based on the sentiment of its neighbor-
ing sentences.
Input: Raw training corpus, labeled as Su,
Step 1. The sentences holding strong polarities
are recognized from Su which satisfies any two of
following requirements, (1) contains known con-
text-free sentiment word (CFSW); (2) contains
more than three known context-dependent senti-
ment words (CDSW); (3) contains collocations
between degree adverbs and known CDSWs; (4)
contains collocations between degree adverbs
and opinion operators (the verbs indicate a opi-
nion operation, such as 称赞 praise); (5) contains
known opinion indicator and known CDSWs.
Step 2. Identify the strong non-opinionated sen-
tences in Su. The sentences satisfying all of fol-
lowing four conditions are recognized as non-
opinionated ones, (1) have no known sentiment
words; (2) have no known opinion operators; (3)
have no known degree adverbs and (4) have no
known opinion indicators.
Step 3. Identify the opinion indicators in the rest
sentences. Determine their polarities if possible
and mark the conjunction (e.g.和 and) or nega-
tion relationship (e.g.但 but) in the sentences.
Step 4. Match the CFSWs and known CDSWs in
Su. The polarities of CFSWs are assigned based
on sentiment lexicon.
Step 5. If a CDSW occurs in a sentence with cer-
tain orientations which is determined by the opi-
nion indicators, its polarity is assigned as the
value suggested. If a CDSW co-occur with a
seed collocated target, it polarity is assigned ac-
cording to the seed sentiment collocation set.
Otherwise, if a CDSW co-occur with a CFSW in
the same sentence, or the neighboring continual
or compound sentence, the polarity of CDSW is
assigned as the same as CFSW, or the reversed
polarity if a negation indicator is detected.
Step 6. Update the polarity scores of CDSWs in
the target set by using the cases where the polari-
ty is determined in Step 5.
Step 7. Determine the polarities of CDSWs in
the undetermined sentences. Suppose Si is a sen-
tence and the polarity scores of all its CFSWs
and CDSWs are known, its polarity, labeled as
Plo(Si), is estimated by using the polarity scores
of all of the opinion words in this sentence, viz.:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999102">
P _ pos(CFSW)−P_neg(CFSW)
Plo Si
( ) = (3)
∑ + P _ pos(CDSW) − P _ neg(CDSW)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.989430636363636">
A large value (&gt;0) of Plo(si) implies that si tends
to be positive, and vice versa.
Step 8. If the sentence polarity cannot be deter-
mined by its components, we use the polarity of
its neighboring sentences sj-1 and sj+1, labeled as
Plo(sj-1) and Plo(sj+1), respectively, to help de-
termine Plo(sj), viz.:
Plo(sj) = 0. 5 ⋅ Plo(sj−1) + Plo * (sj) + 0. 5 ⋅ Plo(sj+1) (4)
where, Plo*(sj) is the polarity score of Sj (Fol-
lowing Equation 3) but ignore the contribution of
testing adjectives while 0.5 are empirical weights.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.638566">
450
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996982">
Step 9. After all of the polarities of known
CDSWs in the training data are determined, up-
date the collocation set by identifying co-
occurred pairs with consistent sentiment.
Step 10. Repeat Step 5 to Step 9 to re-estimate
the sentiment of CDSWs and expand the colloca-
tion set, until the collocation set converge.
In this way, the seed collocation set is further
expanded and their sentiment characteristics are
obtained.

In this paper, we proposed similarity-based and
semi-supervised based methods to expand the
adjective-target seed collocation set. Meanwhile,
we incorporate both inner-sentence (collocations
and context words) and inter-sentence features in
a two-class SVM classifier for the disambigua-
tion of sentiment adjectives. The achieved prom-
ising results show the effectiveness of colloca-
tion features, context words features and senti-
ment of neighboring sentences. Furthermore, we
found that the neighboring sentence sentiments
are important features for the disambiguation of
sentiment ambiguous adjectives, which is ob-
viously different from the traditional word sense
disambiguation that emphasize the inner-
sentence features.

The collocations of 14 testing sentiment adjectives are extracted from a 100-million-word corpus. Collocations with obvious and consistent sentiment are manually identified. 412 positive and 191 negative collocations are established as the seed collocation set. We think that the polarity of a word can be determined by exploiting the association of its cooccurring words in sentence. We assume that, the two instances of an ambiguous sentiment adjectives that have similar neighboring nouns may have the same polarity. Gamon and Aue (2005) made an assumption to label sentiment terms. We extract 13,859 sentences containing collocations between negative adjective and targets in seed collocation set or collocations between ambiguous adjective and negative modifier 449 coverage is low. It is observed that the seed collocation set covers 17.54% of sentences containing the ambiguous adjectives while the collocations between adjective and negative modifier covers only 11.28%. Therefore, we expand the sentiment adjective-target collocation set based on word similarity and a semi-supervised learning algorithm orderly. We then incorporat</context>

The final systems achieved 0.957 and 0.953 (ranked 1st and 2nd) macro accuracy, and 0.936 and 0.933 (ranked 2nd and 3rd) micro accuracy, respectively. 1 Introduction Sentiment analysis is always puzzled by the context-dependent sentiment words that one word brings positive, neutral or negative meanings in different contexts. Hatzivassiloglou and Mckeown (1997) predicated the polarity of adjectives by using the pairs of adjectives linked by consecutive or negation conjunctions. Turney and Littman (2003) determined the polarity of sentiment words by estimating the point-wise mutual information between sentiment words and a set of seed words with strong polarity. Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) used a Sentiment Tag Extraction Program to extract sentimentbearing adjectives from WordNet. Esuli and Sebasian (2006) studied the context-dependent sentiment words in WordNet but ignored the inChunyu Kit2 2City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong ctckit@cityu.edu.hk stances in real context.
