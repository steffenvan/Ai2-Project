Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960875730769231">
We are pleased to present in this volume, the Proceedings of the 9th SIGdial Workshop on Discourse
and Dialogue. These proceedings could not have been produced without the assistance of this year’s
excellent program committee. The quality of the collection is a result of their efforts and we are
indebted to them for donating their time and expertise. 19 of the 46 submissions were accepted as
long papers and another 10 were accepted as short papers. This selection of papers follows the SIGdial
tradition of providing a venue for work on theory, implemented systems, developed work and new
approaches. The topics covered include generation for dialogue systems, dialogue system evaluation,
opinions, persuasion, multi-party dialogue, probabilistic methods for dialogue, grounding and the use
of dialogue features for improving speech processing. We are optimistic that the breadth and quality of
the selected papers will contribute to a lively and interesting workshop event and will prove a valuable
resource for the SIGdial readership.
There are many to thank for their assistance with the organization of the 2008 SIGdial event; we
mention a few of them here. We would like to thank ACL for providing workshop support, and Priscilla
Rasmussen for handling the financial transactions and providing us with valuable information about the
mysteries of matters budgetary. The SIGdial Board was very supportive and provided sage advice to us
on a number of questions that arose in the course of organizing the event. David Traum gave us extra
assistance on several issues and was very responsive to our numerous questions. Additional thanks
go to Harry Bunt, Tim Paek and Livia Polyani for helping us secure sponsorship, to Crystal Nakatsu
for giving us excellent advice on potential reception locations, and to the SIGdial webmaster, Torben
Madsen, for putting up the website.
We also thank Prof. Julia Hirschberg of Columbia University for giving the 2008 SIGdial keynote
address on “Lexical, Acoustic/Prosodic, and Discourse Entrainment in Spoken Dialogue Systems”.
And finally, thank you, the SIGdial audience, for your continued support in making SIGdial a premier
venue for work in Discourse and Dialogue.
