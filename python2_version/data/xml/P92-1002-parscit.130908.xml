ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999816333333333">
An algorithm is proposed to determine an-
tecedents for VP ellipsis. The algorithm elim-
inates impossible antecedents, and then im-
poses a preference ordering on possible an-
tecedents. The algorithm performs with 94%
accuracy on a set of 304 examples of VP el-
lipsis collected from the Brown Corpus. The
problem of determining antecedents for VP el-
lipsis has received little attention in the litera-
ture, and it is shown that the current proposal
is a significant improvement over alternative
approaches.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994723571428571">
To understand an elliptical expression it is nec-
essary to recover the missing material from sur-
rounding context. This can be divided into two
subproblems: first, it is necessary to determine the
antecedent expression. Second, a method of recon-
structing the antecedent expression at the ellipsis
site is required. Most of the literature on ellipsis
has concerned itself with the second problem. In
this paper, I propose a solution for the first prob-
lem, that of determining the antecedent. I focus
on the case of VP ellipsis.
VP ellipsis is defined by the presence of an
auxiliary verb, but no VP, as in the following
example&apos;:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.686594">
(1) a. It might have rained, any time;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.955490428571429">
b. only â€” it did not.
To interpret the elliptical VP &amp;quot;did not&amp;quot;, the
antecedent must be determined: in this case,
&amp;quot;rained&amp;quot; is the only possibility.
The input to the algorithm is an elliptical VP
and a list of VP&apos;s occurring in proximity to the el-
liptical VP. The algorithm eliminates certain VP&apos;s

that are impossible antecedents. Then it assigns
preference levels to the remaining VP&apos;s, based on
syntactic configurations as well as other factors.
Any VP&apos;s with the same preference level are or-
dered in terms of proximity to the elliptical VP.
The antecedent is the VP with the highest prefer-
ence level.
In what follows, I begin with the overall struc-
ture of the algorithm. Next the subparts of the
algorithm are described, consisting of the elimina-
tion of impossible antecedents, and the determina-
tion of a preference ordering based on clausal rela-
tionships and subject coreference. I then present
the results of testing the algorithm on 304 exam-
ples of VP ellipsis collected from the Brown Cor-
pus. Finally, I examine other approaches to this
problem in the literature.

THE ALGORITHM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998241777777778">
The input to the algorithm is an elliptical
VP(VPE), and VPlist, a list of VP&apos;s occurring in
the current sentence, and those occurring in the
two immediately preceding sentences. In addition,
it is assumed that the parse trees of these sentences
are available as global variables, and that NP&apos;s in
these parse trees have been assigned indices to in-
dicate coreference and quantifier binding.
The antecedent selection function is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.67645275">
A-Select(VPlist,VPE)
VPlist := remove-impossible(VPlist,VPE)
VPlist := assign-levels(VPlist,VPE)
antecedent. := select-highest(VPlist,VPE)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999038857142857">
First, impossible antecedents are removed
from the VPlist. Then, the remaining items in
VPlist are assigned preference levels, and the item
with the highest preference level is selected as the
antecedent. If there is more than one item with
the same preference level, the item closest to the
VPE, scanning left from the VPE, is selected.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995146">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.970595636363636">
The definition of the function remove-
impossible is as follows:
remove-impossible(VPlist,VPE)
For all v in VPlist
if ACD(v,VPE) or
BE-DO-conflict(v,VPE)
then remove(v, VPlist)
There are two types of impossible antecedents:
the first involves certain antecedent-containment
structures, and the second involves cases in which
the antecedent contains a BE-form and the target
contains a DO-form. These are described in detail
below.
Next, preference levels are assigned to remain-
ing items in VPlist by the assign-levels function.
(All items on VPlist are initialized with a level of
0.)
assign-levels(VPlist,VPE)
For all v in VPlist
if related-clause(v,VPE) then
v.level := v.level + 1
if coref-subj(v,VPE) then
v.level := v.level + 1
An antecedent is preferred if there is a clausal
relationship between its clause and the VPE
clause, or if the antecedent and the VPE have
coreferentia1 subjects. The determination of these
preferences is described in detail below.
Finally, the select-highest function merely
selects the item on VPlist with the highest prefer-
ence level. If there is more than one item with the
highest preference level, the item nearest to the
VPE (scanning left) is selected.

IMPOSSIBLE ANTECEDENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879833333333">
This section concerns the removal of impossible
antecedents from VPlist. There are two cases in
which a given VP is not a possible antecedent.
The first deals with antecedent-containment, the
second, with conflicts between BE-forms and DO-
forms.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.988556" genericHeader="method">
ANTECEDENT CONTAINMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.890930545454545">
There are cases of VP ellipsis in which the VPE is
contained within the antecedent VP:
[V [... VPE ...]]vp
Such cases are tradition-
ally termed antecedent-contained deletion (ACD).
They are highly constrained, although the proper
formulation of the relevant constraint remains con-
troversial. It was claimed by May (1985) and oth-
ers that ACD is only possible if a quantifier is
present. May argues that this explains the fol-
lowing contrast:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.670829666666667">
(2) a. Dulles suspected everyone who Angelton
did.
b. * Dulles suspected Philby, who Angelton
did.
However, it has been subsequently noted (cf.
Fiengo and May 1991) that such structures do not
require the presence of a quantifier, as shown by
the following examples:
(3) a. Dulles suspected Philby, who Angelton
did too.
b. Dulles suspected Philby, who Angelton
didn&apos;t.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999384666666666">
Thus the algorithm will allow cases of ACD in
which the target is dominated by an NP which is
an argument of the antecedent verb. It will not
allow cases in which the target is dominated by
a sentential complement of the antecedent verb,
such as the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.869309">
(4) That still leaves you a lot of latitude. And
I suppose it did.

<bodyText confidence="0.9767095">
Here, &amp;quot;suppose&amp;quot; is not a possible antecedent
for the elliptical VP. In general, configurations of
the following form are ruled out:
[v [... VPE

<sectionHeader confidence="0.988635" genericHeader="method">
BE/DO CONFLICTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966151272727273">
The auxiliary verb contributes various features to
the complete verb phrase, including tense, aspect,
and polarity. There is no requirement that these
features match in antecedent and elliptical VP.
However, certain conflicts do not appear to be pos-
sible. In general, it is not possible to have a DO-
form as the elliptical VP, with an overt BE-form in
the antecedent. Consider the following example:
(5) Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofief
would have done better, or even as well,
under different circumstances. His fellow-
countryman, Igor Stravinsky, certainly
did not.
In this example, there are two elements on the
VP list: &amp;quot;be certain...&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;do better&amp;quot;. The tar-
get &amp;quot;did not&amp;quot; rules out &amp;quot;be certain&amp;quot; as a possible
antecedent, allowing only the reading &amp;quot;Stravinsky
did not do better&amp;quot;. If the elliptical VP is changed
from &amp;quot;did not&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;was not&amp;quot;, the situation is re-
versed; the only possible reading is then &amp;quot;Stravin-
sky was not certain that Prokofief would have done
better...&amp;quot;.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992642">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.960431428571429">
A related conflict to be ruled out is that of ac-
tive/passive conflicts. A passive antecedent is not
possible if the VPE is a DO-form. For example:
(6) Jubal did not hear of Digby&apos;s disappear-
ance when it was announced, and, when
he did, while he had a fleeting suspicion,
he dismissed it;
In this example, &amp;quot;was announced&amp;quot; is not a
possible antecedent for the VPE &amp;quot;did&amp;quot;.
One possible exception to this rule involves
progressive antecedents, which, although they con-
tain a BE-form, may be consistent with a DO-
form target. The following (constructed) example
seems marginally acceptable:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8284085">
(7) Tom was cleaning his room today. Harry
did yesterday.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9503235">
Thus a BE-form together with a progressive
does not conflict with a DO-form.

PREFERENCE LEVELS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992">
If there are several possible antecedents for a given
VPE, preferences among those antecedents are de-
termined by looking for other relations between
the VPE clause and the clauses containing the pos-
sible antecedents.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.929159" genericHeader="method">
CLAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910166666667">
An antecedent for a given VPE is preferred if there
is a configurational relationship between the an-
tecedent clause and the VPE clause. These include
comparative structures and adverbial clauses.
Elliptical VP&apos;s (VPE) in comparative con-
structions are of the form
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.662691" genericHeader="method">
[VP Comparative [NP VPEB
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990059181818182">
where Comparatives are expressions such as &amp;quot;as
well as&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;better than&amp;quot;, etc. In constructions of
this form there is a strong preference that VP is
the antecedent for VPE. For example:
(8) Now, if Morton&apos;s newest product, a corn
chip known as Chip-o&apos;s, turns out to sell
as well as its stock did...
Here, the antecedent of the VPE &amp;quot;did&amp;quot; is the
VP &amp;quot;sell&amp;quot;.
The next configuration involves VPE&apos;s within
adverbial clauses. For example,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.970764">
(9) But if you keep a calendar of events, as we
do, you noticed a conflict.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996593">
Here the antecedent for the VPE &amp;quot;do&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;keep
a calendar of events&amp;quot;. In general, in configurations
of the form:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.346716" genericHeader="method">
[VP ADV [NP VPE]]
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990655">
VP is preferred over other possible an-
tecedents.
It is important to note that this is a preference
rule, rather than an obligatory constraint. Al-
though no examples of this kind were found in the
Brown Corpus, violations of this constraint may
well be possible. For example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.859854">
(10) John can walk faster than Harry can run.
Bill can walk faster than Barry can.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.912114333333333">
If a reading is possible in which the VPE is
&amp;quot;Barry can run&amp;quot;, this violates the clausal relation-
ship preference rule.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.912887" genericHeader="method">
SUBJECT COREFERENCE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.51556025">
Another way in which two clauses are related is
subject coreference. An antecedent is preferred if
its subject corefers with that of the elliptical VP.
An example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.934961">
(11) He wondered if the audience would let him
finish. They did.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999579333333333">
The preferred reading has &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; coreferential
with &amp;quot;the audience&amp;quot; and the antecedent for &amp;quot;did&amp;quot;
the VP &amp;quot;let him finish&amp;quot;.
Subject &amp;quot;coreference&amp;quot; is determined manually,
and it is meant to reflect quantifier binding as
well as ordinary coreference â€” that is, standard
instances involving coindexing of NP&apos;s.
Again, it must be emphasized that the subject
coreference rule is a preference rule rather than an
obligatory constraint. While no violations were
found in the Brown corpus, it is possible to con-
struct such examples.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.999773" genericHeader="method">
INTERACTION OF PREFERENCE
RULES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95604175">
There are cases where more than one preference
rule applies. The antecedent selected is the item
with the highest preference level. If more than
one item has the same preference level, the item
nearest to the VPE is selected, where nearness is
determined by number of words encountered scan-
ning left from the VPE.
In the following example, two preference rules
apply:
(12) usually, this is most exasperating to men,
who expect every woman to verify their
preconceived notions concerning her sex,
and when she does not, immediately con-
demn her as eccentric and unwomanly.
The VPE clause is an adverbial clause modi-
fying the following clause. Thus the VP &amp;quot;condemn
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9998509">
her as eccentric and unwomanly&amp;quot; receives a pref-
erence level of 1. The subject &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; of the VPE is
coindexed with &amp;quot;every woman&amp;quot;. This causes the
VP &amp;quot;verify their preconceived notions concerning
her sex&amp;quot; to also receive a preference level of 1.
Since both of these elements have the same pref-
erence level, proximity is determined by scanning
left from the VPE. This selects &amp;quot;verify their pre-
conceived notions concerning her sex&amp;quot; as the an-
tecedent.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.983295" genericHeader="method">
TESTING THE ALGORITHM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997565">
The algorithm has been tested on a set of 304 ex-
amples of VP ellipsis collected from the Brown
Corpus. These examples were collected using the
UNIX grep pattern-matching utility. The version
of the Brown Corpus used has each word tagged by
part of speech. I defined search patterns for aux-
iliary verbs that did not have verbs nearby. These
patterns did not succeed in locating all the in-
stances of VP ellipsis in the Brown Corpus. How-
ever, the 304 examples do cover the full range of
types of material in the Brown Corpus, includ-
ing both &amp;quot;Informative&amp;quot; (e.g., journalistic, scien-
tific, and government texts) and &amp;quot;Imaginative&amp;quot;
(e.g., novels, short stories, and humor). I have di-
vided these examples into three categories, based
on whether the antecedent is in the same sentence
as the VPE, the adjacent (preceding) sentence, or
earlier (&amp;quot;Long-Distance&amp;quot;). The definition of sen-
tence is taken from the sentence divisions present
in the Brown Corpus.

RESULTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963222222222">
The algorithm selected the correct antecedent in
285, or 94% of the cases. For comparison pur-
poses, I present results of an alternative strategy;
namely, a simple linear scan of preceding text. In
this strategy, the first verb that is encountered is
taken to be the head of the antecedent VP.
The results of the algorithm and the &amp;quot;Linear
Scan&amp;quot; approach are displayed in the following ta-
ble.
the Linear Scan approach because they are closest
to the VPE. A frequent case of this is contain-
ing antecedents that are ruled out by the algo-
rithm. Another case distinguishing the algorithm
from Linear Scan involves coreferential subjects.
There were several cases in which the coreferen-
tial subject preference rule caused an antecedent
to be selected that was not the nearest to the VPE.
One example is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991692">
(13) a. But, darn it all, why should we help a cou-
ple of spoiled snobs who had looked down
their noses at us?
b. But, in the end, we did.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99850675">
Here, the correct antecedent is the more dis-
tant &amp;quot;help a couple of...&amp;quot;, rather than &amp;quot;looked
down their noses...&amp;quot;. There were no cases in which
Linear Scan succeeded where the algorithm failed.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.967711" genericHeader="evaluation">
SOURCES OF ERROR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.927005666666667">
I will now look at sources of errors for the algo-
rithm. The performance was worst in the Long
Distance category, in which at least one sentence
intervenes between antecedent and VPE. In sev-
eral problem cases in the Long Distance category,
it appears that intervening text contains some
mechanism that causes the antecedent to remain
salient. For example:
(14) a. &amp;quot;...in Underwater Western Eye I&apos;d have a
chance to act. I could show what I can
do&amp;quot;.
b. As far as I was concerned, she had already
and had dandily shown what she could do.
In this case, the elliptical VP &amp;quot;had already&amp;quot;
means &amp;quot;had already had a chance to act&amp;quot;. The
algorithm incorrectly selects &amp;quot;show what I can
do&amp;quot; as the antecedent. The intervening sentence
causes the previous antecedent to remain salient,
since it is understood as &amp;quot;(If I had a chance to
act then) I could show what I can do.&amp;quot; Further-
more, the choice made by the algorithm might per-
haps be eliminated on pragmatic grounds, given
the oddness of &amp;quot;she had already shown what she
could do and had dandily shown what she could

do.
Another way in which the algorithm could be
generalized is illustrated by the follow example:
(15) a. &amp;quot;I didn&apos;t ask you to fight for the ball club&amp;quot;,
Phil said slowly.
b. &amp;quot;Nobody else did, either&amp;quot;.
Here the algorithm incorrectly selects &amp;quot;fight
for the ball club&amp;quot; as the antecedent, instead of &amp;quot;ask
you to fight for the ball club&amp;quot;. The subject coref-
erence rule does not apply, since &amp;quot;Nobody else&amp;quot;
The algorithm performs considerably better
than Linear Scan. Much of the improvement is due
to &amp;quot;impossible antecedents&amp;quot; which are selected by
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997115">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99419676">
is not coreferential with the subject of any of the
possible antecedents. However, its interpretation
is dependent on the subject &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;ask you to fight
for the ball club&amp;quot;. Thus, if one generalized the
subject coreference rule to include such forms of
dependence, the algorithm would succeed on such
examples.
Many of the remaining errors involve an an-
tecedent that takes a VP or S as complement, of-
ten leading to subtle ambiguities. One example of
this is the following:
(16) a. Usually she marked the few who did thank
you, you didn&apos;t get that kind much in a
place like this: and she played a little
game with herself, seeing how downright
rude she could act to the others, before
they&apos;d take offense, threaten to call the
manager.
b. Funny how seldom they did: used to it,
probably.
Here the algorithm selects &amp;quot;call the manager&amp;quot;
as antecedent, instead of &amp;quot;threaten to call the
manager&amp;quot;, which I determined to be the correct
antecedent. It may be that many of these cases
involve a genuine ambiguity.

OTHER APPROACHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989099">
The problem addressed here, of determining the
antecedent for an elliptical VP, has received little
attention in the literature. Most treatments of
VP ellipsis (cf. Sag 1976, Williams 1977, Webber
1978, Fiengo and May 1990, Dalrymple, Shieber
and Pereira 1991) have focused on the question
of determining what readings are possible, given
an elliptical VP and a particular antecedent. For
a computational system, a method is required to
determine the antecedent, after which the possible
readings can be determined.
Lappin and McCord (1990) present an al-
gorithm for VP ellipsis which contains a partial
treatment of this problem. However, while they
define three possible ellipsis-antecedent configura-
tions, they have nothing to say about selecting
among alternatives, if there is more than one VP
in an allowed configuration. The three configu-
rations given by Lappin and McCord for a VPE-
antecedent pair &lt; V,A&gt; are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999209666666667">
1. V is contained in the clausal complement of
a subordinate conjunction SC, where the SC-
phrase is either (i) an adjunct of A, or (ii) an
adjunct of a noun N and N heads an NP argu-
ment of A, or N heads the NP argument of an
adjunct of A.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.964001944444445">
2. V is contained in a relative clause that modifies
a head noun N, with N contained in A, and, if
a verb A&apos; is contained in A and N is contained
in A&apos;, then A&apos; is an infinitival complement of A
or a verb contained in A.
3. V is contained in the right conjunct of a senten-
tial conjunction S, and A is contained in the left
conjunct of S.
An examination of the Brown Corpus exam-
ples reveals that these configurations are incom-
plete in important ways. First, there is no con-
figuration that allows a sentence intervening be-
tween antecedent and VPE. Thus, none of the
Long-Distance examples (about 5% of the sam-
ple) would be covered. Configuration (3) deals
with antecedent-VPE pairs in adjacent S&apos;s. There
are many such cases in which there is no sentential
conjunction. For example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5755015">
(17) a. All the generals who held important com-
mands in World War 2, did not write
books.
b. It only seems as if they did.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99937525">
Perhaps configuration (3) could be interpreted
as covering any adjacent S&apos;s, whether or not an
explicit conjunction is present. 2
Furthermore, there are cases in which the ad-
jacent categories are something other than S; in
the following two examples, the antecedent and
VPE are in adjacent VP&apos;s.
(18) The experts are thus forced to hypothe-
size sequences of events that have never
occurred, probably never will â€” but possi-
bly might.

gory is S&apos;.
(20) I remember him pointing out of the win-
dow and saying that he wished he could
live to see another spring but that he
wouldn&apos;t.
Configurations (1) and (2) deal with
antecedent-VPE pairs within the same sentence.
In Configuration (1), the VPE is in a subordinate
clause, and In (2), the VPE is in a relative clause.
In each case, the VPE is c-commanded by the
antecedent A. While the configurations cover two

tween VPE and related phenomena such as gapping

quite common cases, there are other same-sentence
configurations in which the antecedent does not c-
command the VPE.

are said to use folklore, do not, unless one
counts an occasional superstition or tale.
(22) In reply to a question of whether they now
tax boats, airplanes and other movable
property excluding automobiles, nineteen
said that they did and twenty that they
did not.
In sum, the configurations defined by Lappin
and McCord would miss a significant number of
cases in the Brown Corpus, and, even where they
do apply, there is no method for deciding among

To interpret an elliptical expression it is neces-
sary to determine the antecedent expression, after
which a method of reconstructing the antecedent
expression at the ellipsis site is required. While
the literature on VP ellipsis contains a vast ar-
ray of proposals concerning the proper method of
reconstructing a given antecedent for an elliptical
VP, there has been little attention to the question
of determining the antecedent.
In this paper, I have proposed a solution to
this problem; I have described an algorithm that
determines the antecedent for elliptical VP&apos;s. It
was shown that the algorithm achieves 94% ac-
curacy on 304 examples of VP ellipsis collected
from the Brown Corpus. Many of the failure cases
appear to be due to the interaction of VPE with
other anaphoric phenomena, and others may be
cases of genuine ambiguity.

The algorithm eliminates impossible antecedents, and then imposes a preference ordering on possible antecedents. The algorithm performs with 94% accuracy on a set of 304 examples of VP ellipsis collected from the Brown Corpus. The problem of determining antecedents for VP ellipsis has received little attention in the literature, and it is shown that the current proposal is a significant improvement over alternative approaches.</abstract>

There are two cases in which a given VP is not a possible antecedent. The first deals with antecedent-containment, the second, with conflicts between BE-forms and DOforms. ANTECEDENT CONTAINMENT There are cases of VP ellipsis in which the VPE is contained within the antecedent VP: [V [... VPE ...]]vp Such cases are traditionally termed antecedent-contained deletion (ACD). They are highly constrained, although the proper formulation of the relevant constraint remains controversial. It was claimed by May (1985) and others that ACD is only possible if a quantifier is present. May argues that this explains the following contrast: (2) a. Dulles suspected everyone who Angelton did. b. * Dulles suspected Philby, who Angelton did. However, it has been subsequently noted (cf. Fiengo and May 1991) that such structures do not require the presence of a quantifier, as shown by the following examples: (3) a. Dulles suspected Philby, who Angelton did too. b. Dulles suspected Philby, who Angelton didn&apos;t. Thus the algorithm will allow cases of ACD in which the target is dominated by an NP which is an argument of t</context>
