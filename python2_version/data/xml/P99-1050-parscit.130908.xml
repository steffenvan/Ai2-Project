Abstract

Hypernym links acquired through an infor-
mation extraction procedure are projected on
multi-word terms through the recognition of se-
mantic variations. The quality of the projected
links resulting from corpus-based acquisition is
compared with projected links extracted from a
technical thesaurus.

1 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999676189655173">
In the domain of corpus-based terminology,
there are two main topics of research: term
acquisition—the discovery of candidate terms—
and automatic thesaurus construction—the ad-
dition of semantic links to a term bank. Sev-
eral studies have focused on automatic acquisi-
tion of terms from corpora (Bourigault, 1993;
Justeson and Katz, 1995; Daille, 1996). The
output of these tools is a list of unstructured
multi-word terms. On the other hand, contri-
butions to automatic construction of thesauri
provide classes or links between single words.
Classes are produced by clustering techniques
based on similar word contexts (Schiitze, 1993)
or similar distributional contexts (Grefenstette,
1994). Links result from automatic acquisi-
tion of relevant predicative or discursive pat-
terns (Hearst, 1992; Basili et al., 1993; Riloff,
1993). Predicative patterns yield predicative re-
lations such as cause or effect whereas discursive
patterns yield non-predicative relations such as
generic/specific or synonymy links.
* The experiments presented in this paper were per-
formed on [AGRO], a 1.3-million word French corpus of
scientific abstracts in the agricultural domain. The ter-
mer used for multi-word term acquisition is ACABIT
(Daille, 1996). It has produced 15,875 multi-word terms
composed of 4,194 single words. For expository pur-
poses, some examples are taken from [MEDIC], a 1.56-
million word English corpus of scientific abstracts in the
medical domain.
The main contribution of this article is to
bridge the gap between term acquisition and
thesaurus construction by offering a framework
for organizing multi-word candidate terms with
the help of automatically acquired links between
single-word terms. Through the extraction of
semantic variants, the semantic links between
single words are projected on multi-word can-
didate terms. As shown in Figure 1, the in-
put to the system is a tagged corpus. A par-
tial ontology between single word terms and
a set of multi-word candidate terms are pro-
duced after the first step. In a second step,
layered hierarchies of multi-word terms are con-
structed through corpus-based conflation of se-
mantic variants. Even though we focus here on
generic/specific relations, the method would ap-
ply similarly to any other type of semantic re-
lation.
The study is organized as follows. First, the
method for corpus-based acquisition of semantic
links is presented. Then, the tool for semantic
term normalization is described together with
its application to semantic link projection. The
last section analyzes the results on an agricul-
tural corpus and evaluates the quality of the
induced semantic links.

2 Iterative Acquisition of Hypernym

<bodyText confidence="0.9994957">
We first present the system for corpus-based in-
formation extraction that produces hypernym
links between single words. This system is built
on previous work on automatic extraction of hy-
pernym links through shallow parsing (Hearst,
1992; Hearst, 1998). In addition, our system
incorporates a technique for the automatic gen-
eralization of lexico-syntactic patterns.
As illustrated by Figure 2, the system has two

Shallow Parser and Classifier

A shallow parser is complemented with a classi-
fier for the purpose of discovering new patterns
through corpus exploration. This procedure in-
spired by (Hearst, 1992; Hearst, 1998) is com-
posed of 7 steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.941723222222222">
1. Select manually a representative concep-
tual relation, e.g. the hypernym relation.
2. Collect a list of pairs of terms linked by
the previous relation. This list of pairs of
terms can be extracted from a thesaurus, a
knowledge base or manually specified. For
instance, the hypernym relation neocortex
IS-A vulnerable area is used.
3. Find sentences in which conceptually re-

<bodyText confidence="0.779781916666667">
lated terms occur. These sentences are
lemmatized, and noun phrases are iden-
tified. They are represented as lexico-
syntactic expressions. For instance, the
previous relation HYPERNYM(vu/nerabie
area, neocortex) is used to extract the
sentence: Neuronal damage were found
in the selectively vulnerable areas such as
neocortex, striatum, hippocampus and tha-
lamus from the corpus [MEDIC]. The sen-
tence is then transformed into the following
lexico-syntactic expression:1

<listItem confidence="0.577302882352941">
4. Find a common environment that gener-
alizes the lexico-syntactic expressions ex-
tracted at the third step. This environ-
ment is calculated with the help of a func-
tion of similarity and a procedure of gen-
eralization that produce candidate lexico-
syntactic pattern. For instance, from the
previous expression, and at least another
similar one, the following candidate lexico-
syntactic pattern is deduced:
NP such as LIST (2)
5. Validate candidate lexico-syntactic pat-
terns by an expert.
6. Use these validated patterns to extract ad-
ditional candidate pairs of terms.
7. Validate candidate pairs of terms by an ex-
pert, and go to step 3.

<bodyText confidence="0.999904454545455">
Through this technique, eleven of the lexico-
syntactic patterns extracted from [AGRO] are
validated by an expert. These patterns are ex-
ploited by the information extractor that pro-
duces 774 different pairs of conceptually related
terms. 82 of these pairs are manually selected
for the subsequent steps our study because they
are constructing significant pieces of ontology.
They correspond to ten topics (trees, chemical
elements, cereals, enzymes, fruits, vegetables,
polyols, polysaccharides, proteins and sugars).

3 Semantic Term Normalization

<bodyText confidence="0.9999859375">
The 774 hypernym links acquired through the
iterative algorithm described in the preceding
section are thus distributed: 24.5% between two
multi-word terms, 23.6% between two single-
word terms, and the remaining ones between a
single-word term and a multi-word term. Since
the terms produced by the termer are only
multi-word terms, our purpose in this section
is to design a technique for the expansion of
links between single-word terms to links be-
tween multi-word terms. Given a link between
fruit and apple, our purpose is to infer a simi-
lar link between apple juice and fruit juice, be-
tween any apple N and fruit N, or between ap-
ple N1 and fruit N2 with N1 semantically related
to N2.

Semantic Variation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990981106382979">
The extension of semantic links between sin-
gle words to semantic links between multi-word
terms is semantic variation and the process of
grouping semantic variants is semantic normal-
ization. The fact that two multi-word terms
wi w2 and w&apos;1 w12 contain two semantically-
related word pairs (wi,wc) and (w2,w/2) does not
necessarily entail that wi w2 and wc w&apos;2 are se-
mantically close. The three following require-
ments should be met:
Syntactic isomorphy The correlated words
must occupy similar syntactic positions:
both must be head words or both must be
arguments with similar thematic roles. For
example, procédé d&apos;elaboration (process of
elaboration) is not a variant elaboration
d&apos;une rnethode (elaboration of a process)
even though procédé and methode are syn-
onymous, because procédé is the head word
of the first term while methode is the argu-
ment in the second term.
Unitary semantic relationship The corre-
lated words must have similar meanings
in both terms. For example, analyse du
rayonnement (analysis of the radiation) is
not semantically related with analyse de
l&apos;influence (analysis of the influence) even
particular a complete description of the generalization
patterns process, see the following related publication:
(Morin, 1999).
though rayonnement and influence are se-
mantically related. The loss of semantic
relationship is due to the polysemy of ray-
onnement in French which means influence
when it concerns a culture or a civilization
and radiation in physics.
Holistic semantic relationship The third
criterion verifies that the global meanings
of the compounds are close. For example,
the terms inspection des aliments (food
inspection) and controle alimentaire (food
control) are not synonymous. The first one
is related to the quality of food and the
second one to the respect of norms.
The three preceding constraints can be trans-
lated into a general scheme representing two
semantically-related multi-word terms:

<construct confidence="0.7475395">
Definition 3.1 (Semantic variants) Two
multi-word terms w1 w2 and w&apos;iw&apos;2 are semantic
variants of each other if the three following
constraints are satisfied:4

are arguments with similar thematic roles.

<listItem confidence="0.999361857142857">
2. Some type of semantic relation S holds be-
tween wi and wc and/or between w2 and
w12 (synonymy, hypernymy, etc.). The non
semantically related words are either iden-
tical or morphologically related.
3. The compounds w 1 w2 and w&apos;1 tri2 are also

The formulation of semantic variation given

semantic links between multi-word terms. For
each candidate term w1 w2 produced by the ter-

from a corpus. In other words, a semantic

Through this pattern, a semantic variation is
found between composition du fruit (fruit com-
position) and composes chimiques de la graine
(chemical compounds of the seed). It relies on
the morphological relation between the nouns
compose (compound, M(Ni ,N)) and composi-
tion (composition, N1) and on the semantic
relation (part/whole relation) between graine
(seed, 8(N2)) and fruit (fruit, N2). In addition

Semantic normalization is presented as semantic
variation in (Hamon et al., 1998) and consists
in finding relations between multi-word terms
based on semantic relations between single-word
terms. Our approach differs from this preceding
work in that we exploit domain specific corpus-
based links instead of general purpose dictio-
nary synonymy relationships. Another origi-
nal contribution of our approach is that we ex-
ploit simultaneously morphological, syntactic,
and semantic links in the detection of semantic
variation in a single and cohesive framework.
We thus cover a larger spectrum of linguistic
phenomena: morpho-semantic variations such
as contenu en isotope (isotopic content) a vari-
ant of teneur isotopique (isotopic composition),
syntactico-semantic variants such as contenu en
isotope a variant of teneur en isotope (isotopic
content), and morpho-syntactico-semantic vari-
ants such as durete de la viande (toughness of
the meat) a variant of resistance et la rigidite
de la chair (lit, resistance and stiffness of the
flesh).

4 Projection of a Single Hierarchy
on Multi-word Terms
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997244">
Depending on the semantic data, two modes
of representation are considered: a link mode
in which each semantic relation between two
words is expressed separately, and a class
mode in which semantically related words are
grouped into classes. The first mode corre-
sponds to synonymy links in a dictionary or
to generic/specific links in a thesaurus such as
(AGROVOC, 1995). The second mode corre-
sponds to the synsets in WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998) or to the semantic data provided by the
information extractor. Each class is composed
of hyponyms sharing a common hypernym—
named co-hyponyms—and all their common hy-
pernyms. The list of classes is given in Table 1.

Analysis of the Projection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921666666667">
Through the projection of single word hierar-
chies on multi-word terms, the semantic relation
can be modified in two ways:
Transfer The links between concepts (such as
fruits) are transferred to another concep-
tual domain (such as juices) located at a
different place in the taxonomy. Thus the
link between fruit and apple is transferred
to a link between fruit juice and apple juice,
two hyponyms of juice. This modification
results from a semantic normalization of ar-
gument words.
Specialization The links between concepts
(such as fruits) are specialized into parallel
relations between more specific concepts lo-
cated lower in the hierarchy (such as dried
fruits). Thus the link between fruit and
apple is specialized as a link between dried
fruits and dried apples. This modification
is obtained through semantic normalization
of head words.
The Transfer or the Specialization of a given
hierarchy between single words to a hierarchy
between multi-word terms generally does not
preserve the full set of links. In Figure 4, the
initial hierarchy between plant products is only
partially projected through Transfer on juices
or dryings of plant products and through Spe-
cialization on fresh and dried plant products.

three columns indicate the number of multi-
word links projected through Specialization, the
number of correct links and the corresponding
value of precision. The same values are pro-
vided for Transfer projections in the following
three columns.
Transfer projections are more frequent (507
links) than Specializations (77 links). Some
classes, such as chemical elements, cereals and
fruits are very productive because they are com-
posed of generic terms. Other classes, such as
trees, vegetables, polyols or proteins, yield few
semantic variations. They tend to contain more
specific or less frequent terms.
The average precision of Specializations is
relatively low (58.4% on average) with a high
standard deviation (between 16.7% and 100%).
Conversely, the precision of Transfers is higher
(83.8% on average) with a smaller standard
deviation (between 69.0% and 100%). Since
Transfers are almost ten times more numer-
ous than Specializations, the overall precision
of projections is high: 80.5%.
In addition to relations between multi-word
terms, the projection of single-word hierar-
chies on multi-word terms yields new candidate
terms: the variants of candidate terms produced
at the first step. For instance, sechage de la
banane (banana drying) is a semantic variant
of sechage de fruits (fruit drying) which is not
provided by the first step of the process. As
in the case of links, the production of multi-
word terms is more important with Transfers
(72 multi-word terms) than Specializations (345
multi-word terms) (see Table 3). In all, 417 rele-
vant multi-word terms are acquired through se-
mantic variation.

made using semantic links from the thesaurus
(AGROVOC, 1995).6
The results of this second experiment are very
similar to the first experiment. Here, the preci-
6(AGROVOC, 1995) is composed of 15,800 descrip-
tors but only single-word terms found in the corpus
[AGRO] are used in this evaluation (1,580 descriptors).
From these descriptors, 168 terms representing 4 topics
(cultivation, plant anatomy, plant products and flavor-
ings) are selected for the purpose of evaluation.
sion of Specializations is similar (57.8% for 45
links inferred), while the precision of Transfers
is slightly lower (72.4% for 326 links inferred).
Interestingly, these results show that links re-
sulting from the projection of a thesaurus have
a significantly lower precision (70.6%) than pro-
jected corpus-based links (80.5%).
A study of Table 3 shows that, while 197
projected links are produced from 94 corpus-
based links (ratio 2.1), only 88 such projected
links are obtained through the projection of
159 links from AGROVOC (ratio 0.6). Ac-
tually, the ratio of projected links is higher
with corpus-based links than thesaurus links,
because corpus-based links represent better the
ontology embodied in the corpus and associate
more easily with other single word to produce
projected hierarchies.

<abstract confidence="0.99375947979798">Hypernym links acquired through an information extraction procedure are projected on multi-word terms through the recognition of semantic variations. The quality of the projected links resulting from corpus-based acquisition is compared with projected links extracted from a technical thesaurus. 1 Motivation domain of corpus-based terminology, there are two main topics of research: term acquisition—the discovery of candidate terms— and automatic thesaurus construction—the addition of semantic links to a term bank. Several studies have focused on automatic acquisition of terms from corpora (Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Daille, 1996). The output of these tools is a list of unstructured multi-word terms. On the other hand, contributions to automatic construction of thesauri provide classes or links between single words. Classes are produced by clustering techniques based on similar word contexts (Schiitze, 1993) or similar distributional contexts (Grefenstette, 1994). Links result from automatic acquisition of relevant predicative or discursive patterns (Hearst, 1992; Basili et al., 1993; Riloff, 1993). Predicative patterns yield predicative resuch as discursive patterns yield non-predicative relations such as generic/specific or synonymy links. * The experiments presented in this paper were performed on [AGRO], a 1.3-million word French corpus of scientific abstracts in the agricultural domain. The termer used for multi-word term acquisition is ACABIT (Daille, 1996). It has produced 15,875 multi-word terms composed of 4,194 single words. For expository purposes, some examples are taken from [MEDIC], a 1.56million word English corpus of scientific abstracts in the medical domain. The main contribution of this article is to bridge the gap between term acquisition and thesaurus construction by offering a framework for organizing multi-word candidate terms with the help of automatically acquired links between single-word terms. Through the extraction of semantic variants, the semantic links between single words are projected on multi-word candidate terms. As shown in Figure 1, the input to the system is a tagged corpus. A partial ontology between single word terms and a set of multi-word candidate terms are produced after the first step. In a second step, layered hierarchies of multi-word terms are constructed through corpus-based conflation of semantic variants. Even though we focus here on generic/specific relations, the method would apply similarly to any other type of semantic relation. The study is organized as follows. First, the method for corpus-based acquisition of semantic links is presented. Then, the tool for semantic term normalization is described together with its application to semantic link projection. The last section analyzes the results on an agricultural corpus and evaluates the quality of the induced semantic links. 2 Iterative Acquisition of Hypernym Links We first present the system for corpus-based information extraction that produces hypernym links between single words. This system is built on previous work on automatic extraction of hypernym links through shallow parsing (Hearst, 1992; Hearst, 1998). In addition, our system incorporates a technique for the automatic generalization of lexico-syntactic patterns. As illustrated by Figure 2, the system has two functionalities: 389 • • • • • • • • • • Multi-word terms \ Corpus Term nonnalizer Single word hierarchy Hierarchies of multi-word terms Figure 1: Overview of the system for hierarchy projection 1. The corpus-based acquisition of lexicosyntactic patterns with respect to a specific conceptual relation, here hypernym. 2. The extraction of pairs of conceptually related terms through a database of lexicosyntactic patterns. Shallow Parser and Classifier A shallow parser is complemented with a classifier for the purpose of discovering new patterns through corpus exploration. This procedure inspired by (Hearst, 1992; Hearst, 1998) is composed of 7 steps: 1. Select manually a representative conceprelation, hypernym relation. 2. Collect a list of pairs of terms linked by the previous relation. This list of pairs of terms can be extracted from a thesaurus, a knowledge base or manually specified. For the hypernym relation area used. 3. Find sentences in which conceptually related terms occur. These sentences are lemmatized, and noun phrases are identified. They are represented as lexicosyntactic expressions. For instance, the previous relation HYPERNYM(vu/nerabie neocortex) used to extract the damage were found the selectively areassuch as neocortex,striatum, hippocampus and thathe corpus [MEDIC]. The sentence is then transformed into the following find in NP such as LIST(1) for a noun phrase, and LIST for a succession of noun phrases. 4. Find a common environment that generalizes the lexico-syntactic expressions extracted at the third step. This environment is calculated with the help of a function of similarity and a procedure of generalization that produce candidate lexicosyntactic pattern. For instance, from the previous expression, and at least another similar one, the following candidate lexicosyntactic pattern is deduced: such as LIST(2) 5. Validate candidate lexico-syntactic patterns by an expert. 6. Use these validated patterns to extract additional candidate pairs of terms. 7. Validate candidate pairs of terms by an expert, and go to step 3. Through this technique, eleven of the lexicosyntactic patterns extracted from [AGRO] are validated by an expert. These patterns are exploited by the information extractor that produces 774 different pairs of conceptually related terms. 82 of these pairs are manually selected for the subsequent steps our study because they are constructing significant pieces of ontology. They correspond to ten topics (trees, chemical elements, cereals, enzymes, fruits, vegetables, polyols, polysaccharides, proteins and sugars). Automatic Classification of Lexico-syntactic Patterns Let us detail the fourth step of the preceding algorithm that automatically acquires lexicosyntactic patterns by clustering similar patterns. 390 Bootstrap: initial pairs of terms Shallow parser Lexico-syntactic + classifier patterns Corpus Lexical preprocessor Lemmatized and tagged corpus Information extractor Database of Partial hierarchies of single-word terms lexico-syntactic patterns Figure 2: The information extraction system As described in item 3. above, pattern is acquired from the relation HYPERarea,neocortex).

Since the terms produced by the termer are only multi-word terms, our purpose in this section is to design a technique for the expansion of links between single-word terms to links between multi-word terms. Given a link between purpose is to infer a similink between juice juice, beany and or between apand semantically related Semantic Variation The extension of semantic links between single words to semantic links between multi-word is variation the process of semantic variants is normalfact that two multi-word terms w2 and contain two semanticallyword pairs (wi,wc) and does not entail that wi w2 and wc are semantically close.

For example, terms des aliments and alimentaire control) are not synonymous. The first one is related to the quality of food and the second one to the respect of norms. The three preceding constraints can be translated into a general scheme representing two semantically-related multi-word terms: 3.1 (Semantic variants) terms w1 w2 and are semantic variants of each other if the three following are are head words and are arguments with similar thematic roles. 2. Some type of semantic relation S holds between wi and wc and/or between w2 and (synonymy, hypernymy, etc.). The non semantically related words are either identical or morphologically related. The compounds w 1 w2 and are also linked by the semantic relation S. Corpus-based Semantic Normalization The formulation of semantic variation given above is used for corpus-based acquisition of semantic links between multi-word terms. For each candidate term w1 w2 produced by the termer, the set of its semantic variants satisfying the constraints of Definition 3.1 is extracted from a corpus. In other words, a semantic normalization of the corpus is performed based on corpus-based semantic links between single words and variation patterns defined as all the W2 an abbreviated notation for a phrase that contains the two content words wi and w2 such that one of both is the head word and the other one an argument. For the sake of simplicity, only binary terms are considered, but our techniques would straightforwardly extend to n-ary terms with n &gt; 3. 392 licensed combinations of morphological, syntactic and semantic links.

In addition to the morphological and semantic relations, the categories of the words in the semantic variant chimiques A la graineN satisfy the regular expression: the categories that are realized are underlined. Related Work Semantic normalization is presented as semantic variation in (Hamon et al., 1998) and consists in finding relations between multi-word terms based on semantic relations between single-word terms. Our approach differs from this preceding work in that we exploit domain specific corpusbased links instead of general purpose dictionary synonymy relationships. Another original contribution of our approach is that we exploit simultaneously morphological, syntactic, and semantic links in the detection of semantic variation in a single and cohesive framework. We thus cover a larger spectrum of linguistic phenomena: morpho-semantic variations such en isotope content) a variof isotopique composition), variants such contenu en variant of en isotope content), and morpho-syntactico-semantic varisuch as de la viande of meat) a variant of et la rigidite la chair resistance and stiffness of the flesh). symbols for part of speech categories are N (Noun), A (Adjective), Art (Article), Prep (Preposition), Punc (Punctuation), Adv (Adverb). 4 Projection of a Single Hierarchy on Multi-word Terms Depending on the semantic data, two modes representation are considered: a mode in which each semantic relation between two is expressed separately, and a which semantically related words are grouped into classes. The first mode corresponds to synonymy links in a dictionary or to generic/specific links in a thesaurus such as (AGROVOC, 1995). The second mode corresponds to the synsets in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) or to the semantic data provided by the information extractor. Each class is composed of hyponyms sharing a common hypernym— their common hy- The list of classes is given in Table Analysis of the Projection Through the projection of single word hierarchies on multi-word terms, the semantic relation can be modified in two ways: links between concepts (such as fruits) are transferred to another conceptual domain (such as juices) located at a different place in the taxonomy. Thus the between transferred a link between juice juice, two hyponyms of juice. This modification results from a semantic normalization of argument words. links between concepts (such as fruits) are specialized into parallel relations between more specific concepts located lower in the hierarchy (such as dried Thus the link between is as a link between apples. modification is obtained through semantic normalization of head words. The Transfer or the Specialization of a given hierarchy between single words to a hierarchy between multi-word terms generally does not preserve the full set of links. In Figure 4, the hierarchy between products is projected through Transfer on of plant products through Speon plant products.

Thus only some of the possible projected links are observed through corpus exploration. 5 Evaluation Projection of Corpus-based Links Table 2 shows the results of the projection of corpus-based links. The first column indicates the semantic class from Table 1. The next 394 three columns indicate the number of multiword links projected through Specialization, the number of correct links and the corresponding value of precision. The same values are provided for Transfer projections in the following three columns. Transfer projections are more frequent (507 links) than Specializations (77 links). Some such as elements, cereals very productive because they are composed of generic terms. Other classes, such as vegetables, polyols few semantic variations. They tend to contain more specific or less frequent terms. The average precision of Specializations is relatively low (58.4% on average) with a high standard deviation (between 16.7% and 100%). Conversely, the precision of Transfers is higher (83.8% on average) with a smaller standard deviation (between 69.0% and 100%). Since Transfers are almost ten times more numerous than Specializations, the overall precision of projections is high: 80.5%. In addition to relations between multi-word terms, the projection of single-word hierarchies on multi-word terms yields new candidate terms: the variants of candidate terms produced the first step. For instance, de la drying) is a semantic variant de fruits drying) which is not provided by the first step of the process. As in the case of links, the production of multiword terms is more important with Transfers (72 multi-word terms) than Specializations (345 multi-word terms) (see Table 3). In all, 417 relevant multi-word terms are acquired through semantic variation. Comparison with AGROVOC Links In order to compare the projection of corpusbased links with the projection of links extracted from a thesaurus, a similar study was made using semantic links from the thesaurus The results of this second experiment are very to the first experiment. Here, the preci- 1995) is composed of 15,800 descriptors but only single-word terms found in the corpus [AGRO] are used in this evaluation (1,580 descriptors). From these descriptors, 168 terms representing 4 topics (cultivation, plant anatomy, plant products and flavorings) are selected for the purpose of evaluation. sion of Specializations is similar (57.8% for 45 links inferred), while the precision of Transfers is slightly lower (72.4% for 326 links inferred). Interestingly, these results show that links resulting from the projection of a thesaurus have a significantly lower precision (70.6%) than projected corpus-based links (80.5%). A study of Table 3 shows that, while 197 projected links are produced from 94 corpusbased links (ratio 2.1), only 88 such projected links are obtained through the projection of 159 links from AGROVOC (ratio 0.6). Actually, the ratio of projected links is higher with corpus-based links than thesaurus links, because corpus-based links represent better the ontology embodied in the corpus and associate more easily with other single word to produce projected hierarchies. 6 Perspectives Links between single words projected on multiword terms can be used to assist terminologists during semi-automatic extension of thesauri. The methodology can be straightforwardly applied to other conceptual relations such as synonymy or meronymy.

The first mode corresponds to synonymy links in a dictionary or to generic/specific links in a thesaurus such as (AGROVOC, 1995). The second mode corresponds to the synsets in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) or to the semantic data provided by the information extractor. Each class is composed of hyponyms sharing a common hypernym— named co-hyponyms—and all their common hypernyms. The list of classes is given in Table 1. Analysis of the Projection Through the projection of single word hierarchies on multi-word terms, the semantic relation can be modified in two ways: Transfer The links between concepts (such as fruits) are transferred to another conceptual domain (such as juices) located at a different place in the taxonomy.

Thus only some of the possible projected links are observed through corpus exploration. 5 Evaluation Projection of Corpus-based Links Table 2 shows the results of the projection of corpus-based links. The first column indicates the semantic class from Table 1. The next 394 three columns indicate the number of multiword links projected through Specialization, the number of correct links and the corresponding value of precision.

As in the case of links, the production of multiword terms is more important with Transfers (72 multi-word terms) than Specializations (345 multi-word terms) (see Table 3). In all, 417 relevant multi-word terms are acquired through semantic variation. Comparison with AGROVOC Links In order to compare the projection of corpusbased links with the projection of links extracted from a thesaurus, a similar study was made using semantic links from the thesaurus (AGROVOC, 1995).6 The results of this second experiment are very similar to the first experiment. Here, the preci6(AGROVOC, 1995) is composed of 15,800 descriptors but only single-word terms found in the corpus [AGRO] are used in this evaluation (1,580 descriptors). From these descriptors, 168 terms representing 4 topics (cultivation, plant anatomy, plant products and flavorings) are selected for the purpose of evaluation. sion of Specializations is similar (57.8% for 45 links inferred), while the precision of Transfers is slightly lower (72.4% for 326 links inferred).

Related Work Semantic normalization is presented as semantic variation in (Hamon et al., 1998) and consists in finding relations between multi-word terms based on semantic relations between single-word terms. Our approach differs from this preceding work in that we exploit domain specific corpusbased links instead of general purpose dictionary synonymy relationships. Another original contribution of our approach is that we exploit simultaneously morphological, syntactic, and semantic links in the detection of semantic variation in a single and cohesive framework. We thus cover a larger spectrum of linguistic phenomena: morpho-semantic variations such as contenu en isotope (isotopic con</context>
