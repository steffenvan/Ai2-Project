<bodyText confidence="0.994494333333333">
Though there has been substantial research
concerning the extraction of information from
clinical notes, to date there has been less work
concerning the extraction of useful infor-
mation from patient-generated content. Using
a dataset comprised of online support group
discussion content, this paper investigates two
dimensions that may be important in the ex-
traction of patient-generated experiences from
text; significant individuals/groups and medi-
cation use. With regard to the former, the pa-
per describes an approach involving the pair-
ing of important figures (e.g. family, hus-
bands, doctors, etc.) and affect, and suggests
possible applications of such techniques to re-
search concerning online social support, as
well as integration into search interfaces for
patients. Additionally, the paper demonstrates
the extraction of side effects and sentiment at
different phases in patient medication use, e.g.
adoption, current use, discontinuation and
switching, and demonstrates the utility of such
an application for drug safety monitoring in
online discussion forums.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952426229508">
Online support groups are a rich source of infor-
mation concerning patient experiences, but they
are far different from clinical content. Instead of
“The patient presents with...” and “denies vomit-
ing,” patients may speak of their “doc” and
“rheumy.” There may be utterances like “LOL”
(laugh out loud) and “Hugs.” Patients may raise
issues that they may be reticent to speak with
health care practitioners about, day-to-day condi-
tion management issues, or personal strategies
that they have for taking medicine.
In recent years, it has been observed that pa-
tients may be a valuable source of expertise to
other patients, and that they provide information
that is different from the expertise of clinicians
(Civan &amp; Pratt, 2007; Hartzler &amp; Pratt, 2011).
This may include: action strategies, recommend-
ed knowledge, suggested approaches, and infor-
mation resources for dealing with problems.
This content can be extremely valuable to clini-
cians and patients alike; however, to date most
interfaces for patient-generated content offer few
features tailored to the unique nature of the con-
tent in these support forums.
Thus, the objective of the current paper was to
explore techniques for extracting and visualizing
dimensions of patient experience. For this pre-
liminary work, two specific dimensions were
selected: interpersonal interactions and medica-
tion use.
Interpersonal interactions are an important di-
mension to consider because others have such a
profound impact on patient experience. For ex-
ample, social support from family, friends and
even practitioners can be invaluable to patients;
and understanding, (or the lack of it), from prac-
titioners and other people in one’s life can be
enormously difficult for people, especially those
dealing with a stigmatized condition such as fi-
bromyalgia (Barker, 2008). Thus, automatic
identification of patient experiences with others,
e.g. family, husband, wife, son, daughter, doctor,
etc., and ways of highlighting similar types of
experiences across patients, might serve various
uses. Scientists could use this to study social
support, physician-patient communication and
other types of interpersonal interactions. Inte-
grated into a search interface, patients could
search for others with similar experiences, and
see if there are strategies that they could use to
address their own problem.
Medication use is another important dimen-
sion of patient experience. There has also been
an increased interest in the use of online discus-
sion content to predict adverse events and moni-
tor off-label prescription practices (e.g. Wang et
al., 2011; Leaman et al., 2010; Chee et al., 2011).
This work differs from previous literature in that
the method identifies and visually contextualizes
patient medication experiences, particularly in
terms of stages of use and affect.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907777777778">
This work draws primarily upon two streams of
literature: automated analyses of health-related
discussion content, and extraction of medication-
related information from text. With regard to the
former, a large number of studies have employed
the software, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC), to compare emotional expression in
communities or associations between emotional
expression and health outcomes (e.g. Siriaraya et
al., 2011; Han et al., 2008).
Other studies of online support groups have
focused on social support. Wang, Kraut and
Levine (2012) used machine learning with fea-
tures generated using LIWC and Latent Dirichlet
Allocation to investigate whether different types
and amounts of social support are associated
with length of membership. Namkoong et al.
(2010) examined the effects of exchanging
treatment information within computer-mediated
breast cancer support groups on emotional well-
being. Treatment information exchange was as-
sessed using InfoTrend, a software program that
employs a rule-based system for computer-aided
coding of key ideas.
The task of extraction of medication-related
information has often been explored in past liter-
ature. For example, the 2009 i2b2 medication
challenge focused on the extraction of medica-
tion-related information from discharge summar-
ies including: medication name, dosage, mode,
frequency, duration and reason (Spasic et al.,
2010). This study differs from previous work in
that, the focus is not on the time of day or the
frequency of medication use, but rather, the stage
in the adoption/discontinuation of a medication
an individual is at.

3 Method

<bodyText confidence="0.999803095238095">
Discussion content was downloaded through a
series of focused crawls of a health-related social
networking site (SNS), DailyStrength
(http://www.dailystrength.org). The
content from the corpus encompasses a span of
time of approximately 3.5 years, from the site’s
inception in 2006, to early 2010.
Text pre-processing was done to strip code
and extract post metadata. The text was parsed
and tagged using the Stanford Parts-of-Speech
Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). An affective
lexicon, WordNet-Affect was used to identify
words with emotional content in the text (Strap-
parava &amp; Valitutti, 2004). There are many spe-
cialized resources that could be used to extract
medical terminology. However, forum partici-
pants wrote in ways that often departed from
medical terminology; thus, it was decided that
manually constructed lexicons of medication
names, side effects and people would be more
effective.

4.2 Modeling Interpersonal Interactions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999488">
This work first addresses the challenge of model-
ing interpersonal interactions. There are two
methods of visualization that are explored: the
coupling of people and affect, and that of people
and actions.
The first step in the pairing of people and af-
fect, was to identify and estimate rates of occur-
rence of important figures appearing in the text
such as: family, husband, wife, mother, friend,
and doctor. In order to extract these relations,
the researcher manually compiled a list of terms
indicating such relations through review of social
support literature pertaining to the focal condi-
tions and manual analysis of the text. Alterna-
tive names such as “hubby” for husband, “doc”
and “dr” for doctor, and “rheumy” for rheuma-
tologist, were included. Many of the instances of
the word “family” appeared were references to
family doctors or family history; these references
were excluded from the estimates (Table 2).
These results show that certain types of indi-
viduals tend to appear in forum conversations for
certain conditions over others: mothers, family
and friends in breast cancer; sons, daughters, and
“people” in Type 1 diabetes; and doctors in fi-

bromyalgia. As can be seen, many posts do not
include references to other people, but rather,
focus on other areas such as patients’ own expe-
riences.

The highest proportion of fear, happiness and

Though anger and frustration were not as com-
mon as other emotions, higher levels of these
emotions in diabetes are perhaps worthy of note.

Next, the degree of affect expressed in prox-
imity with these roles was investigated. Various
sentiment lexicons are available, e.g. Senti-
WordNet, WordNet-Affect and the LIWC lexi-
con. Many lexicons classify words as positive or
negative or by a limited set of emotions; howev-
er, with complex issues like health and interper-
sonal interactions, there may be multiple dimen-
sions. WordNet-Affect was selected for its di-
verse set of emotion categories. Following a re-
view of emotion research and preliminary con-
tent analysis of the corpus, seven emotions were
selected on the basis of frequency and relevance
to the conditions (Table 3).

<bodyText confidence="0.99990235">
The percentage of posts expressing various af-
fect types was calculated (Table 4). Across all
conditions, fear and hope were most common.
Radar graphs illustrating the extent of emo-
tional expression for the various roles were gen-
erated to facilitate comparison (Fig. 1). The light
blue line, representing “doctor,” is the innermost
ring in all cases, demonstrating that emotional
expression occurs least often in posts that men-
tion doctors. Posts mentioning family (dark blue
lines) were generally associated with higher de-
grees of emotional expression. Moreover, it is
interesting that the patterns of emotional expres-
sion are quite different across conditions.
This paper also explores the visualization of
discussion content by combining important fig-
ures and their actions. For this preliminary work,
this action was undertaken with the fibromyalgia
forum. The approach taken here was to extract
high frequency verbs co-occurring in the same
sentence with the target role. High frequency
verbs that co-occurred with “doctor” included:
“said,” “told,” “gave,” “prescribed,” “started,”
and “diagnosed.” The verb “asked” also oc-
curred frequently because forum participants of-
ten discussed or suggested questions to ask of
doctors. Arranging person-verb pairings together
in an interface could be a convenient way to ac-
quire a sense of what patients are being told, and
what medications doctors are prescribing. One
might even add additional search constraints.
For example, with regard to patient experiences
with doctors prescribing Lyrica, the system
might retrieve: “Recently my doctor put me on
Lyrica which did help but had meÉ,” “My doc-
tor gave me a ‘taper down’ schedule,” “My doc-
tor prescribed Lyrica which I refused to take.”
Patients could use such a system to acquire a
sense of the range of experiences that others have
had with the drug.

4.3 Modeling Medication Use
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997651529411765">
Extant literature has found that though some
categories of discussion content, e.g. self-
introductions, research results and study in-
vites, are common across conditions, other
types of discussion content differ, e.g., breast
cancer discussion more commonly focuses on
treatments, and fibromyalgia discussions tend
to focus more on medications (Chen, 2012).
Thus, in this study, the researcher selected fi-
bromyalgia as a case study for modeling dis-
cussion or comments about medication use.
The researcher created a lexicon of drug
names for use in this study, drawn from a re-
view of fibromyalgia literature and information
resources, as well as manual review of corpus
content. The most common medications are
listed in Table 3.

In order to model temporal differences in
patient experience with medications, this study
implemented a rule-based system for extrac-
tion at five phases in the adoption and use of a
medication: adoption, current use, transition,
switching, and discontinuation (Table 4).
Adoption referred to when an individual began
taking a medication. Current use referred to
the period in which a person is taking a medi-
cation, and has no plans (that he or she reveals
at least) to discontinue it. If an individual said
that they first had a certain kind of experience
with a medication, but that later on it changed,
this was referred to as “transition.” Discontin-
uation referred to when an individual stopped
using one medication, and switching to when
an individual changed from using one medica-
tion to another. Information such as whether
side effects were temporary, withdrawal symp-
toms and interactions/contraindications was
also extracted. These rules were implemented
at the sentence level to prevent misattributions
of side effects when multiple medications are
mentioned in the same post.

Figure 2 shows that, for Lyrica, the predom-
inant symptom that was reported by patients
was weight gain, which appeared in almost all
phases. Those who took Savella reported
symptoms such as nausea, high blood pressure

reports that these disappear over time (Fig. 3).

Another important aspect of patients’ expe-
rience with certain medications is their attitude
towards it. In the previous section, the focus
was on emotions because they are important
for understanding interpersonal interaction. In
the case of medications, rather than tracking
the appearance of emotion, it may be useful to
consider positive/negative polarity, whether
the medication works or not, and side effects.
Thus, in addition to side effects, sentences
with positive and negative sentiment were ex-
tracted using WordNet-Affect. Words from
the “happiness” and “hope” categories of
Word-Net Affect were used for positive senti-
ment, and the “fear,” “anger” and “sadness”
categories of WordNet-Affect were used for
negative sentiment. A lexicon constructed by
examining the corpus supplemented the words
from WordNet-Affect.
A rule-based system was implemented to
identify instances in which participants men-
tioned whether a medication worked or not.
This was implemented using keywords such as
“effective,” “work” or “help,” and recognizing
negation. Table 7 lists the number of senti-
ment and perceptions of efficacy mentions.
These do not add up to the number of medica-
tion mentions, as many times when medica-
tions appear, sentiment is neutral or ambigu-
ous, and perception of efficacy is not the topic
of the post. For example, the text might say,
“The doctor started me on Savella yesterday.”
These results illustrate the utility of extract-
ing multiple facets of patient medication expe-
rience, e.g. positive/negative valence, efficacy
and side effects, in order to better understand
these experiences. Of particular note in these
findings are that the estimates of one dimen-
sion may appear to conflict with another. For
example, overall sentiment towards many
medications is negative, but they are reported
as working more often than not. The side ef-
fects tell yet another story; in many cases, the
side effects are different in different phases.
Reading the content, one comes to understand
that, in an overwhelming number of cases, it is
not that patients have found medications that
solve all their problems, but that they are se-
lecting ones that work and weighing the costs
of the side effects. Thus, an interface that ena-
bles users to view all these nuances could be
an invaluable asset.

The last facet of medication use that was
modeled was suggestions and/or recommenda-
tions from forum participants. One rule for
doing this was by extracting sentences that
began with verbs such as: “try,” “take,” “ask,”
“tell,” and “go.” Another was to extract sen-
tences with “suggest” or “recommend.” Doing
so would retrieve advice such as: “Ask ur doc-

suggested staying on the LyricaÉ. while...
doing the Vitamin D treatment,” and “Word of
advice: stop taking SSRI &apos;s at least one week
prior to start of Savella.”
Forum posts are valuable because they are
rich troves of patient experience; however,
their richness means that it is also possible to
get lost in the story. An interface that organiz-
es the advice, but also allows one to link to the
full text, can help users to orient themselves.

5 Discussion and Implications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973132075472">
This study employed NLP techniques in order
to model two dimensions of patient experience
in online support forums: interpersonal interac-
tions and medication use. With regard to in-
teractions with others, the prominence of dif-
ferent individuals and associated affect dif-
fered depending on condition. With regard to
medication use, patients’ experiences of medi-
cation use differed along phase of adoption.
These results may have important implica-
tions for the design of support forums. For
example, in posts about family that contained
fear and anxiety, certain topics tended to occur
often: family history, families being supportive
or non-supportive, and concerns of worrying
the family. Forum participants presented vari-
ous perspectives and suggestions concerning
these issues. Thus, one recommendation is
that systems could be designed to organize
these various perspectives and suggestions in a
form that is easier for the viewer to understand.
The results of this study also yielded various
insights concerning fibromyalgia. In particu-
lar, the prominence of doctors, and relatively
infrequent mention of family and friends was
worthy of note. Previous research has found
that fibromyalgia patients report a lack of un-
derstanding from medical practitioners and
others around them (e.g. Madden &amp; Sim, 2006;
Sim &amp; Madden, 2008). These reports of inter-
actions with medical practitioners could help
researchers to understand where gaps in
knowledge and communication exist in both
parties, and attempt to rectify them. The con-
tent from online support forums may also be
helpful for researchers seeking to understand
patients’ patterns of interpersonal interaction.
The framework presented here for modeling
medication use could be useful in many set-
tings. Visualizing side effects at various points
in the adoption, use and perhaps discontinua-
tion of a medication could avert potential mis-
understandings. For example, sentiment anal-
ysis on a medication X might be favorable
overall; however, decomposing the posts by
phase might show that users initially react fa-
vorably, but develop problems with it over
time. Of course, the converse, that individuals
experience certain side effects initially, but that
these disappear over time, could also be true.
Such information could be useful to a wide
audience, including patients, clinicians, re-
searchers and the pharmaceutical industry.

5.1 Limitations and Future Directions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983848484848">
There are many directions in which the current
work could be improved. First, in the case of
interpersonal interactions, affect was modeled
as dichotomous variable indicating presence or
absence. However, the level of emotional ex-
pression in a post could vary substantially.
Thus, it may be useful to employ a lexicon that
provides word rankings, such as SentiWordNet
(Esuli &amp; Sebastiani, 2006).
In the case of medication use, extraction of
relevant sentences was based on presence of
the medication name; thus, the system would
not have identified sentences in which pro-
nouns were used. A system that performed co-
reference resolution might identify significant-
ly more references to medications.
Because previous research has indicated that
medications are a common topic in fibromyal-
gia-related discussion, medication use was a
natural target for modeling discussion content.
However, it would also be useful to extend the
modeling to include treatment experiences.
Treatments such as massage and aqua therapy
are often used in fibromyalgia, and treatments
are the foci for many other conditions, such as
breast cancer. Rather than considering phases
of medication use, one might consider psycho-
logical state and expectations prior to, during
and after treatment. Lastly, the interface that
was developed for exploring medication use
was specific to fibromyalgia; moving forward,
it would be useful to expand the interface to
other conditions.

<abstract confidence="0.99954872">Though there has been substantial research concerning the extraction of information from clinical notes, to date there has been less work concerning the extraction of useful information from patient-generated content. Using a dataset comprised of online support group discussion content, this paper investigates two dimensions that may be important in the extraction of patient-generated experiences from text; significant individuals/groups and medication use. With regard to the former, the paper describes an approach involving the pairing of important figures (e.g. family, husbands, doctors, etc.) and affect, and suggests possible applications of such techniques to research concerning online social support, as well as integration into search interfaces for patients. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the extraction of side effects and sentiment at different phases in patient medication use, e.g. adoption, current use, discontinuation and switching, and demonstrates the utility of such an application for drug safety monitoring in online discussion forums.</abstract>

For this preliminary work, two specific dimensions were selected: interpersonal interactions and medication use. Interpersonal interactions are an important dimension to consider because others have such a profound impact on patient experience. For example, social support from family, friends and even practitioners can be invaluable to patients; and understanding, (or the lack of it), from practitioners and other people in one’s life can be enormously difficult for people, especially those dealing with a stigmatized condition such as fibromyalgia (Barker, 2008). Thus, automatic identification of patient experiences with others, e.g. family, husband, wife, son, daughter, doctor, etc., and ways of highlighting similar types of experiences across patients, might serve various uses. Scientists could use this to study social support, physician-patient communication and other types of interpersonal interactions. Integrated into a search interface, patients could search for others with similar experiences, and see if there are strategies that they could use to address their own problem. Medication use is another important dimension of patient experience. T</context>

Thus, in this study, the researcher selected fibromyalgia as a case study for modeling discussion or comments about medication use. The researcher created a lexicon of drug names for use in this study, drawn from a review of fibromyalgia literature and information resources, as well as manual review of corpus content.

Such information could be useful to a wide audience, including patients, clinicians, researchers and the pharmaceutical industry. 5.1 Limitations and Future Directions There are many directions in which the current work could be improved. First, in the case of interpersonal interactions, affect was modeled as dichotomous variable indicating presence or absence. However, the level of emotional expression in a post could vary substantially. Thus, it may be useful to employ a lexicon that provides word rankings, such as SentiWordNet (Esuli &amp; Sebastiani, 2006). In the case of medication use, extraction of relevant sentences was based on presence of the medication name; thus, the system would not have identified sentences in which pronouns were used. A system that performed coreference resolution might identify significantly more references to medications. Because previous research has indicated that medications are a common topic in fibromyalgia-related discussion, medication use was a natural target for modeling discussion content. However, it would also be useful to extend the modeling to include treatment experiences. Treatments such as massage </context>

Thus, one recommendation is that systems could be designed to organize these various perspectives and suggestions in a form that is easier for the viewer to understand. The results of this study also yielded various insights concerning fibromyalgia. In particular, the prominence of doctors, and relatively infrequent mention of family and friends was worthy of note. Previous research has found that fibromyalgia patients report a lack of understanding from medical practitioners and others around them (e.g. Madden &amp; Sim, 2006; Sim &amp; Madden, 2008). These reports of interactions with medical practitioners could help researchers to understand where gaps in knowledge and communication exist in both parties, and attempt to rectify them. The content from online support forums may also be helpful for researchers seeking to understand patients’ patterns of interpersonal interaction. The framework presented here for modeling medication use could be useful in many settings. Visualizing side effects at various points in the adoption, use and perhaps discontinuation of a medication could avert potential misunderstandings. For</context>

There are many specialized resources that could be used to extract medical terminology. However, forum participants wrote in ways that often departed from medical terminology; thus, it was decided that manually constructed lexicons of medication names, side effects and people would be more effective. 4 Results The results are reported in three parts: descriptive statistics for the corpus, interaction with others and medication information. 4.1 Corpus The corpus is comprised of discussion posts for three conditions.

Thus, one recommendation is that systems could be designed to organize these various perspectives and suggestions in a form that is easier for the viewer to understand. The results of this study also yielded various insights concerning fibromyalgia. In particular, the prominence of doctors, and relatively infrequent mention of family and friends was worthy of note. Previous research has found that fibromyalgia patients report a lack of understanding from medical practitioners and others around them (e.g. Madden &amp; Sim, 2006; Sim &amp; Madden, 2008). These reports of interactions with medical practitioners could help researchers to understand where gaps in knowledge and communication exist in both parties, and attempt to rectify them. The content from online support forums may also be helpful for researchers seeking to understand patients’ patterns of interpersonal interaction. The framework presented here for modeling medication use could be useful in many settings. Visualizing side effects at various points in the adoption, use and perhaps discontinuation of a medication could avert potential misunderstandings. For example, sentiment a</context>

The content from the corpus encompasses a span of time of approximately 3.5 years, from the site’s inception in 2006, to early 2010. Text pre-processing was done to strip code and extract post metadata. The text was parsed and tagged using the Stanford Parts-of-Speech Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). An affective lexicon, WordNet-Affect was used to identify words with emotional content in the text (Strapparava &amp; Valitutti, 2004). There are many specialized resources that could be used to extract medical terminology. However, forum participants wrote in ways that often departed from medical terminology; thus, it was decided that manually constructed lexicons of medication names, side effects and people would be more effective. 4 Results The results are reported in three parts: descriptive statistics for the corpus, interaction with others and medication information. 4.1 Corpus The corpus </context>

Scientists could use this to study social support, physician-patient communication and other types of interpersonal interactions. Integrated into a search interface, patients could search for others with similar experiences, and see if there are strategies that they could use to address their own problem. Medication use is another important dimension of patient experience. There has also been an increased interest in the use of online discussion content to predict adverse events and monitor off-label prescription practices (e.g. Wang et al., 2011; Leaman et al., 2010; Chee et al., 2011). This work differs from previous literature in that the method identifies and visually contextualizes patient medication experiences, particularly in terms of stages of use and affect. 16 Proceedings of the ACL Student Research Workshop, pages 16–22, Sofia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c�2013 Association for Computational Linguistics 2 Background This work draws primarily upon two streams of literature: automated analyses of health-related discussion content, and extraction of medicationrelated information from text.
