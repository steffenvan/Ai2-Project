This paper presents a formal account of the
temporal interpretation of text. The distinct nat-
ural interpretations of texts with similar syntax
are explained in terms of defeasible rules charac-
terising causal laws and Gricean-style pragmatic
maxims. Intuitively compelling patterns of defea-
sible entailment that are supported by the logic
in which the theory is expressed are shown to un-

The temporal interpretation of text involves an
account of how the events described are related
to each other. These relations follow from the
discourse relations that are central to temporal
import.1 Some of these are listed below, where
the clause a appears in the text before 16:

a consequence of (but not necessarily caused by)
the event described in a:

logical forms. They indicate, therefore, that the
constraints on the use of the above discourse re-
lations cannot rely solely on the logical forms of
the sentences concerned.
No theory at present is able to explain the dis-
tinct temporal structures of all the above texts.
Webber (1988) observes that Kamp &amp; Rohrer
(1983), Partee (1984), Hinrichs (1986) and Dowty
(1986) don&apos;t account for the backwards movement
of time in (2) and (3). Webber (1988) can account
for the backwards movement of time in (2), but
her theory is unable to predict that mismatching
the descriptive order of events and their temporal
order is allowed in some cases (e.g. (2) and (3))
but not in others (e.g. (1), which would be mis-
leading if the situation being described were one
where the greeting happened before Max stood
up).
Our aim is to characterise the circumstances
under which each of the above discourse relations
hold, and to explain why texts can invoke dif-
ferent temporal relations in spite of their similar
syntax.
Dahlgren (1988) represents the difference be-
tween (1) and (3) in terms of probabilistic laws
describing world knowledge (wK) and linguistic
knowledge (LK). Our approach to the problem
is generally sympathetic to hers. But Dahlgren&apos;s
account lacks an underlying theory of inference.
Furthermore, it&apos;s not clear how a logical conse-
quence relation could be defined upon Dahlgren&apos;s
representation scheme because the probabilistic
laws that need to interact in certain specific ways
are not logically related. Unlike Dahlgren (1988),
we will supply an inference regime that drives the
interpretation of text.
The properties required of an inference mech-
anism for inferring the causal structure underly-
ing text is discussed in (Lascarides &amp; Oberlander,
1991). The work presented here builds on this in
two ways; first by supplying the required notion of
inference, and second by accounting for discourse
structure as well as temporal structure.

Temporal Relations and
Defeasible Reasoning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996411666666667">
Let us consider texts (1) and (3) on an intu-
itive level. There is a difference in the relation
that typically holds between the events being de-
scribed. Intuitively, world knowledge (wK) in-
cludes a causal &apos;law&apos; gained from perception and
experience that relates falling and pushing:3
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.890994">
• Causal Law 3
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878217391304">
Connected events el where x falls and e2
where y pushes x are normally such that e2
causes ei.
There is no similar law for standing up and greet-
ing. The above law is a defeasible law. Our claim
is that it forms the basis for the distinction be-
tween (1) and (3), and that defeasible reasoning
underlies the temporal interpretation of text.
First consider text (1). Intuitively, if there
is no temporal information at all gained from
WK or syntactic markers (apart from the simple
past tense which is the only temporal &apos;expres-
sion&apos; we consider here), then the descriptive order
of events provides the only vital clue as to their
temporal order, and one assumes that descriptive
order matches temporal order. This principle is
a re-statement of Grice&apos;s (1975) maxim of Man-
ner, where it is suggested that text should be or-
derly, and it is also motivated by the fact that
the author typically describes events in the or-
der in which the protagonist perceives them (cf.
Dowty (1986)). This maxim of interpretation can
be captured by the following two laws:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.550478">
• Narration
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8515625">
Unless there&apos;s information to the contrary,
clauses a and )3 that are discourse-related
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6997165">
are such that Narration(a, #) holds.
• Axiom for Narration
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9736688125">
If Narration(a,#) holds, and a and # de-
scribe the events el and e2 respectively, then
el occurs before e2.
Narration is defeasible and the Axiom for Narra-
tion is indefeasible. The idea that Gricean-style
pragmatic maxims should be represented as de-
feasible rules is suggested in (Joshi, Webber &amp;
Weischedel (1984)).
The above rules can be defined in MASH—a
logic for defeasible reasoning described in (Asher
&amp; Morreau, 1991). We will demonstrate shortly
that an intuitively compelling pattern of defeasi-
ble inference can then underly the interpretation
of (1).
MASH supplies a modal semantics for a lan-
guage with a default or generic quantifier, and a

dynamic partial semantics of belief states is built
on top of this modal semantics to capture intu-
itively compelling patterns of non-monotonic rea-
soning. We use a propositional version of MASH
here. Defaults are represented as 0 &gt; .0 (read
as &amp;quot;0 then 0, unless there is information to the
contrary&amp;quot;). The monotonic component of the the-
ory defines a notion of validity that supports
axioms such as k 13(0 0) ((x &gt; 4,)
(x &gt; 0)). The dynamic belief theory supplies the
nonmonotonic component, and the corresponding
nonmonotonic validity, k, describes what reason-
able entailments follow from the agent&apos;s beliefs.

We assume a dynamic theory of discourse struc-
ture construction in which a discourse structure
is built up through the processing of successive
clauses in a text. To simplify our exposition,
we will assume that the basic constructs of these
structures are clauses.4 Let (a, fi&apos;) mean that the
clause is to be attached to the clause a with a
discourse relation, where a is part of the already
built up discourse structure. Let me(a) be a term
that refers to the main eventuality described by
a (e.g. me(Mar stood up) is the event of Max
standing up).6 Then Narration and the axiom
on Narration are represented in MASH as follows
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.517955">
(e1 e2 means &amp;quot;el wholly occurs before e2&amp;quot;):
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9410755">
4The theory should extend naturally to an account
where the basic constructs are segments of text; the
approach adopted here is explored extensively in Asher
( fort hcoming).

We assume that in interpreting text the reader
believes all LK and WK (and therefore believes
Narration and its axiom), the laws of logic, and
the sentences in the text. The sentences in (1) are
represented in a DRT-type framework as follows:6
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9847845">
(7) [ei , [t &lt; now, hold(ei,ti), standup(m, el)]
(8) [e2, t2][t2 &lt; now, hold(e2,t2), greet(j, m, e2)]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963151515151">
In words, (7) invokes two discourse referents el
and ti (which behave like deictic expressions),
where el is an event of Max standing up, 11 is
a point of time earlier than now and el occurs at
11. (8) is similar save that the event e2 describes
John greeting Max. (7) and (8) place no condi-
tions on the relative temporal order between el
and e2. These are derived at a higher level of anal-
ysis than sentential semantics by using defeasible
reasoning.
Suppose that the reader also believes that the
clauses in text (1) are related by some discourse
relation, as they must be for the text to be coher-
ent. Then the reader&apos;s beliefs also include (7,8).
The natural interpretation of (1) is derived by
calculating the common sense entailments from
the reader&apos;s belief state. Given the assumptions
on this state that we have just described, the an-
tecedent to Narration is verified, and so by Defea-
sible Modus Ponens, N arration(7 , 8) is inferred.
Since the belief states in MASH support modal clo-
sure, this result and the Axiom on Narration en-
tail that the reader believes the main eventuality
of (7), namely el, precedes the main eventuality
of (8), namely e2. So the intuitive discourse struc-
ture and temporal interpretation of (1) is derived
by exploiting defeasible knowledge that expresses
a Gricean-style pragmatic maxim.
But the analysis of (1) is satisfactory only if
the same technique of exploiting defeasible rules
can be used to obtain the appropriate natural in-
terpretation of (3), which is different from (1) in
spite of their similar syntax.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9955902">
6For the sake of simplicity we ignore the problem of
resolving the NP anaphora in (8). The truth definitions
of (7) and (8) are like those given in DRT save that they
are evaluated with respect to a possible world index since
MASH is modal.

As we mentioned before, Causal Law 3 will pro-
vide the basis for the distinct interpretations of
(1) and (3). The clauses in (3) must be related
by a discourse relation for the text to be coherent,
and therefore given the meanings of the discourse
relations, the events described must be connected
somehow. Therefore when considering the do-
main of interpreting text, one can re-state the
above causal law as follows:7
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984394">
• Causal Law 3
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9968602">
Clauses a and /3 that are discourse-related
where a describes an event el of x falling
and /3 describes an event e2 of y pushing x
are normally such that e2 causes el.
The representation of this in MASH is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.816727">
• Causal Law 3
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990418052631579">
(a, MA f all(x,me(a))Aptish(y, x,me(fl)) &gt;
cause(me(f3), me(a))
This represents a mixture of WK and linguistic
knowledge (LK), for it asserts that given the sen-
tences are discourse-related somehow, and given
the kinds of events that are described by these
sentences, the second event described caused the
first, if things are normal.
The logical forms for (3a) and (3b) are the
same as (7) and (8), save that standup and greet
are replaced respectively with fall and push.
Upon interpreting (3), the reader believes all de-
feasible WK and LK together with (3a), (3b) and
(3a, 3b). Hence the antecedents to two defeasible
laws are satisfied: Narration and Causal Law 3.
Moreover, the antecedent of Law 3 entails that
of Narration, and the laws conflict because of the
axiom on Narration and the axiom that causes
precede effects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.752259">

<equation confidence="0.417075">
0 (Vele2)(cause(ei e2) -,e2 ei)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997895">
The result is a &apos;Complex&apos; Penguin Principle: it
is complex because the consequents of the two
defeasible laws are not ( and but instead the
laws conflict in virtue of the above axioms. MASH
supports the more complex Penguin Principle:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.95487675">
7 This law may seem very &apos;specific&apos;. It could potentially
be generalised, perhaps by re-stating el as x moving and
e2 as y applying a force to x. For the sake of brevity we
ignore this generalisation.

Therefore there is a defeasible inference that the
pushing caused the falling from the premises, as
required.
The use of the discourse relation Explanation

In words, if a and [3 are discourse-related and the
event described in fl caused the event described in
a, then Explanation(a, 13) normally holds. Fur-
thermore, Explanation imposes a certain tempo-
ral structure on the events described so that if 0&apos;
is a causal explanation of a then 13&apos;s event doesn&apos;t
precede a&apos;s:

The antecedent to Narration is verified by the
reader&apos;s beliefs, and given the results of the Com-
plex Penguin Principle above, the antecedent to
Explanation is also verified. Moreover, the an-
tecedent to Explanation entails that of Narration,
and these laws conflict because of the above ax-
joins. So there is another complex Penguin Prin-
ciple, from which Explanation(3a, 3b) is inferred.
The second application of the Penguin Prin-
ciple in the above used the results of the first,
but in nonmonotonic reasoning one must be wary
of dividing theories into `subtheories&apos; in this way
because adding premises to nonmonotonic deduc-
tions does not always preserve conclusions, mak-
ing it necessary to look at the theory as a whole.
(Lascarides Si Asher, 1991) shows that the pred-
icates involved in the above deduction are suffi-
ciently independent that in MASH one can indeed
divide the above into two applications of the Pen-
guin Principle to yield inferences from the theory
as a whole. Thus our intuitions about the kind of
reasoning used in analysing (3) are supported in
the logic. We call this double application of the
Penguin Principle where the second application
uses the results of the first the Cascaded Penguin
Principle.&apos;

Distinct Discourse Structures
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859">
Certain constraints are imposed on discourse
structure: Let R be Explanation or Elaboration;
then the current sentence can be discourse re-
lated only to the previous sentence a, to a sen-
tence such that R(3, a), or to a sentence 7 such
that R(-y, )3) and R(# , a). This is a simpler ver-
sion of the definition for possible attachment sites
in Asher (forthcoming). Pictorially, the possi-
ble sites for discourse attachment in the example
structure below are those marked open:

<bodyText confidence="0.9667638">
There are structural similarities between our
notion of openness and Polanyi&apos;s (1985). The
above constraints on attachment explain the awk-
wardness of text (9a-f) because (9c) is not avail-
able to (9f) for discourse attachment.

According to the constraint on attachment, the
only available sentence for attachment if one were
to add a sentence to (1) is John greeted him,
whereas in (3), both sentences are available. Thus
although the sentences in (1) and (3) were as-
signed similar structural semantics, they have very
different discourse structures. The events they
fiict between defeasible laws whose antecedents are such
that one of them entails the other is resolvable. Thus un-

distinctions have been characterised in terms of

States Overlap ensures that when attached clauses
describe an event and state and we have no knowl-
edge about how the event and state are connected,
gained from WK or syntactic markers like because
and therefore, we assume that they temporally
overlap. This law can be seen as a manifesta-
tion of Grice&apos;s Maxim of Relevance as suggested
in (Lascarides, 1990): if the start of the state is
not indicated by stating what caused it or by in-
troducing an appropriate syntactic marker, then
by Grice&apos;s Maxim of Relevance the starting point,
and is irrelevant to the situation being described.
So the start of the state must have occurred be-
fore the situation that the text is concerned with
occurs. As before, we assume that unless there is
information to the contrary, the descriptive order
of eventualities marks the order of their discovery.
This together with the above assumption about
where the state starts entail that unless there&apos;s
information to the contrary, the state temporally
overlaps events or states that were described pre-

We assume that the logical form of the sec-
ond clause in (4) entails state(me(P)) by the
classification of the predicate dark as stative.
So Background is derived from the Cascaded
Penguin Principle: the two resolvable conflicts
are States Overlap and Narration and Back-
ground and Narration. States Overlap and Nar-
ration conflict because of the inconsistency of
over/ap(ei, e2) and el -&lt; e2; Background and
Narration conflict because of the axioms for Back-
ground and Narration.

The reader&apos;s beliefs in analysing (5) verify the an-
tecedents of Narration, States Overlap and Law
5. Narration conflicts with States Overlap, which
in turn conflicts with Law 5. Moreover, the an-
tecedent of Law 5 entails that of States Overlap,
which entails that of Narration. So there is a
&apos;Penguin-type&apos; conflict where Law 5 has the most
specific antecedent. In MASH Law 5&apos;s consequent,
i.e. cause(me(5a), me(5b)), is inferred from these
premises. The antecedent of Result is thus sat-
isfied, but the antecedent to Background is not.
Result does not conflict with Narration, and so
by Defeasible Modus Ponens, both Result(5a,5b)
and Narration(5a,5b) are inferred.
Note that thanks to the axioms on Background
and Result and the inconsistency of overlap(ei, e2)
and el -&lt; e2, these discourse relations are in-
consistent. This captures the intuition that if
a causes b, then b could not have been the case
when a happened. In particular, if Max switching
off the light caused the darkness, then the room
could not have been dark when Max switched off
the light.

(9a, 9e). (9d, 9e) verifies the antecedent to Narra-

The distinct discourse relations and event rela-
tions arose from intuitively compelling patterns
of defeasible entailment. The Penguin Principle
captures the intuition that a reader never ignores
information salient in text that is relevant to cal-
culating temporal and discourse structure. The
Nixon Diamond provided the key to &apos;popping&apos;
from subordinate discourse structure.
We have investigated the analysis of texts in-
volving only the simple past tense, with no other
temporal markers present. Lascarides &amp; Asher
(1991) show that the strategy pursued here can
be applied to the pluperfect as well. Future work
will involve extending the theory to handle texts
that feature temporal connectives and adverbials.

The sentences in texts (1) and (3) and in (4) have similar syntax, and therefore similar assume Moens and Steedxnan&apos;s (1988) tripartite structure of events, where an event consists of a preparatory phase, a culmination and a consequent phase. 55 logical forms. They indicate, therefore, that the constraints on the use of the above discourse relations cannot rely solely on the logical forms of the sentences concerned. No theory at present is able to explain the distinct temporal structures of all the above texts. Webber (1988) observes that Kamp &amp; Rohrer (1983), Partee (1984), Hinrichs (1986) and Dowty (1986) don&apos;t account for the backwards movement of time in (2) and (3). Webber (1988) can account for the backwards movement of time in (2), but her theory is unable to predict that mismatching the descriptive order of events and their temporal is allowed in some (2) and (3)) but not in others (e.g. (1), which would be misleading if the situation being described were one the greeting happened stood up). Our aim is to characterise the circumstances under which each of the above discourse relations hold, and to explain why texts can invoke different temporal relations in spite of their similar syntax. Dahlgren (1988) represents the difference between (1) and (3) in terms of probabilistic laws describing world knowledge (wK) and linguistic knowledge (LK). Our approach to the problem is generally sympathetic to hers. But Dahlgren&apos;s account lacks an underlying theory of inference. Furthermore, it&apos;s not clear how a logical consequence relation could be defined upon Dahlgren&apos;s representation scheme because the probabilistic laws that need to interact in certain specific ways are not logically related. Unlike Dahlgren (1988), we will supply an inference regime that drives the interpretation of text. The properties required of an inference mechanism for inferring the causal structure underlying text is discussed in (Lascarides &amp; Oberlander, 1991). The work presented here builds on this in two ways; first by supplying the required notion of inference, and second by accounting for discourse structure as well as temporal structure. Temporal Relations and Defeasible Reasoning Let us consider texts (1) and (3) on an intuitive level. There is a difference in the relation that typically holds between the events being described. Intuitively, world knowledge (wK) includes a causal &apos;law&apos; gained from perception and that relates falling and • Causal Law 3 events where and x are normally such that e2 causes ei. There is no similar law for standing up and greet- The above law is a law. claim is that it forms the basis for the distinction between (1) and (3), and that defeasible reasoning underlies the temporal interpretation of text. First consider text (1). Intuitively, if there is no temporal information at all gained from syntactic markers (apart from the simple past tense which is the only temporal &apos;expression&apos; we consider here), then the descriptive order of events provides the only vital clue as to their temporal order, and one assumes that descriptive order matches temporal order. This principle is a re-statement of Grice&apos;s (1975) maxim of Manwhere it is suggested that text should be orit is also motivated by the fact that the author typically describes events in the order in which the protagonist perceives them (cf. Dowty (1986)). This maxim of interpretation can be captured by the following two laws: • Narration Unless there&apos;s information to the contrary, clauses a and )3 that are discourse-related such that holds. • Axiom for Narration and a and # dethe events and respectively, then el occurs before e2. Narration is defeasible and the Axiom for Narration is indefeasible. The idea that Gricean-style pragmatic maxims should be represented as defeasible rules is suggested in (Joshi, Webber &amp; Weischedel (1984)). above rules can be defined in logic for defeasible reasoning described in (Asher &amp; Morreau, 1991). We will demonstrate shortly that an intuitively compelling pattern of defeasible inference can then underly the interpretation of (1). a modal semantics for a language with a default or generic quantifier, and a 3The causal law&apos;s index corresponds to the index of the which it is relevant. 56 dynamic partial semantics of belief states is built on top of this modal semantics to capture intuitively compelling patterns of non-monotonic rea- We use a propositional version of Defaults are represented as 0 &gt; there is information to the The monotonic component of the theory defines a notion of validity that supports such as 13(0 &gt; &gt; dynamic belief theory supplies the nonmonotonic component, and the corresponding nonmonotonic validity, k, describes what reasonable entailments follow from the agent&apos;s beliefs. supports (at least) the following patterns of common sense reasoning: Defeasible Modus Ponens &gt; but not 0 &gt; 0,-4 k e.g. Birds fly, Tweety is a bird k Tweety flies, but not: Birds fly, Tweety is a bird that doesn&apos;t fly k Tweety flies.

Nixon Diamond (0 &gt; &gt; q5,( --.0)) e.g. There is irresolvable conflict in the following: Quakers are pacifists, Republicans are nonpacifists, Nixon is a Quaker and Republican. We assume a dynamic theory of discourse structure construction in which a discourse structure is built up through the processing of successive clauses in a text. To simplify our exposition, we will assume that the basic constructs of these are Let (a, fi&apos;) mean that the clause is to be attached to the clause a with a discourse relation, where a is part of the already up discourse structure. Let a term that refers to the main eventuality described by (e.g. stood up) the event of Max Then Narration and the axiom Narration are represented in follows (e1 e2 means &amp;quot;el wholly occurs before e2&amp;quot;): theory should extend naturally to an account where the basic constructs are segments of text; the approach adopted here is explored extensively in Asher ( fort hcoming). is formally defined in Lascarides SE Asher (1991) in a way that agrees with intuitions. • Narration &gt; Narration(a, • Axiom on Narration We assume that in interpreting text the reader all therefore believes Narration and its axiom), the laws of logic, and the sentences in the text. The sentences in (1) are in a DRT-type framework as (7) , [t &lt; now, standup(m, [e2, t2][t2 hold(e2,t2), greet(j, m, In words, (7) invokes two discourse referents el (which behave like deictic expressions), where el is an event of Max standing up, 11 is a point of time earlier than now and el occurs at 11. (8) is similar save that the event e2 describes John greeting Max. (7) and (8) place no conditions on the relative temporal order between el and e2. These are derived at a higher level of analysis than sentential semantics by using defeasible reasoning. Suppose that the reader also believes that the clauses in text (1) are related by some discourse relation, as they must be for the text to be coherent. Then the reader&apos;s beliefs also include (7,8). The natural interpretation of (1) is derived by calculating the common sense entailments from the reader&apos;s belief state. Given the assumptions on this state that we have just described, the antecedent to Narration is verified, and so by Defea- Modus Ponens, arration(7 , is inferred. the belief states in modal closure, this result and the Axiom on Narration entail that the reader believes the main eventuality of (7), namely el, precedes the main eventuality of (8), namely e2. So the intuitive discourse structure and temporal interpretation of (1) is derived by exploiting defeasible knowledge that expresses a Gricean-style pragmatic maxim. But the analysis of (1) is satisfactory only if the same technique of exploiting defeasible rules can be used to obtain the appropriate natural interpretation of (3), which is different from (1) in spite of their similar syntax. the sake of simplicity we ignore the problem of resolving the NP anaphora in (8). The truth definitions (7) and (8) are like those given in they are evaluated with respect to a possible world index since modal. 57 (3) a. Max fell. b. John pushed him. As we mentioned before, Causal Law 3 will provide the basis for the distinct interpretations of (1) and (3). The clauses in (3) must be related by a discourse relation for the text to be coherent, and therefore given the meanings of the discourse relations, the events described must be connected somehow. Therefore when considering the domain of interpreting text, one can re-state the causal law as • Causal Law 3 Clauses a and /3 that are discourse-related a describes an event el of and /3 describes an event e2 of y pushing x normally such that causes el. representation of this in is: • Causal Law 3 all(x,me(a))Aptish(y, x,me(fl)) &gt; cause(me(f3), me(a)) represents a mixture of linguistic knowledge (LK), for it asserts that given the sentences are discourse-related somehow, and given the kinds of events that are described by these sentences, the second event described caused the first, if things are normal. The logical forms for (3a) and (3b) are the same as (7) and (8), save that standup and greet replaced respectively with Upon interpreting (3), the reader believes all dewith (3a), (3b) and (3a, 3b). Hence the antecedents to two defeasible laws are satisfied: Narration and Causal Law 3. Moreover, the antecedent of Law 3 entails that of Narration, and the laws conflict because of the axiom on Narration and the axiom that causes precede effects: • Causes Precede Effects e2) ei) The result is a &apos;Complex&apos; Penguin Principle: it is complex because the consequents of the two defeasible laws are not ( and but instead the conflict in virtue of the above axioms. supports the more complex Penguin Principle: 7This law may seem very &apos;specific&apos;. It could potentially be generalised, perhaps by re-stating el as x moving and as y applying a force to the sake of brevity we ignore this generalisation. • Complex Penguin Principle OOP&gt; X,0&gt;C,O(X not: 0(0 --+ &gt; C, X Therefore there is a defeasible inference that the pushing caused the falling from the premises, as required. use of the discourse relation is characterised by the following rule: • Explanation &gt; Exp/anation(a, /3) words, if a and discourse-related and the event described in fl caused the event described in then Explanation(a, holds. Furthermore, Explanation imposes a certain temporal structure on the events described so that if 0&apos; is a causal explanation of a then 13&apos;s event doesn&apos;t precede a&apos;s: • Axiom on Explanation —0 The antecedent to Narration is verified by the reader&apos;s beliefs, and given the results of the Complex Penguin Principle above, the antecedent to Explanation is also verified. Moreover, the antecedent to Explanation entails that of Narration, and these laws conflict because of the above axjoins. So there is another complex Penguin Prinfrom which is inferred. The second application of the Penguin Principle in the above used the results of the first, but in nonmonotonic reasoning one must be wary of dividing theories into `subtheories&apos; in this way because adding premises to nonmonotonic deductions does not always preserve conclusions, making it necessary to look at the theory as a whole. 1991) shows that the predicates involved in the above deduction are suffiindependent that in can indeed divide the above into two applications of the Penguin Principle to yield inferences from the theory as a whole. Thus our intuitions about the kind of reasoning used in analysing (3) are supported in the logic. We call this double application of the Penguin Principle where the second application the results of the first the Penguin Principle.&apos; a general level, MASH is designed so that the con- 58 Distinct Discourse Structures Certain constraints are imposed on discourse Let current sentence can be discourse reonly to the previous sentence a sensuch that a), to a sentence 7 such R(-y, and , a). is a simpler version of the definition for possible attachment sites in Asher (forthcoming).

<abstract confidence="0.972986725806451">There are structural similarities between our notion of openness and Polanyi&apos;s (1985).

According to the constraint on attachment, the available sentence for attachment one were add sentence to (1) is greeted him, whereas in (3), both sentences are available.

The events they fiict between defeasible laws whose antecedents are such that one of them entails the other is resolvable. Thus unwanted irresolvable conflicts can be avoided. describe also have different causal structures.

This law can be seen as a manifestation of Grice&apos;s Maxim of Relevance as suggested in (Lascarides, 1990): if the start of the state is not indicated by stating what caused it or by introducing an appropriate syntactic marker, then by Grice&apos;s Maxim of Relevance the starting point, and is irrelevant to the situation being described. the start of the state must have occurred besituation that the text is concerned with occurs.

Narration conflicts with States Overlap, which in turn conflicts with Law 5. Moreover, the antecedent of Law 5 entails that of States Overlap, which entails that of Narration. So there is a &apos;Penguin-type&apos; conflict where Law 5 has the most antecedent. In 5&apos;s consequent, is inferred from these premises. The antecedent of Result is thus satisfied, but the antecedent to Background is not. Result does not conflict with Narration, and so Defeasible Modus Ponens, both and Narration(5a,5b) are inferred. that thanks to the axioms on the inconsistency of -&lt; e2, these discourse relations are inconsistent. This captures the intuition that if causes not have been the case when a happened. In particular, if Max switching off the light caused the darkness, then the room could not have been dark when Max switched off the light. Discourse Popping Consider text (9a-e): (9) a.

Conclusion We have proposed that distinct natural interpretations of texts with similar syntax can be explained in terms of defeasible rules that represent 61 causal laws and Gricean-style pragmatic maxims. The distinct discourse relations and event relations arose from intuitively compelling patterns of defeasible entailment. The Penguin Principle captures the intuition that a reader never ignores information salient in text that is relevant to calculating temporal and discourse structure. The Nixon Diamond provided the key to &apos;popping&apos; from subordinate discourse structure. We have investigated the analysis of texts involving only the simple past tense, with no other markers present. Lascarides (1991) show that the strategy pursued here can be applied to the pluperfect as well. Future work will involve extending the theory to handle texts that feature temporal connectives and adverbials.</abstract>

This principle is a re-statement of Grice&apos;s (1975) maxim of Manner, where it is suggested that text should be orderly, and it is also motivated by the fact that the author typically describes events in the order in which the protagonist perceives them (cf. Dowty (1986)).
