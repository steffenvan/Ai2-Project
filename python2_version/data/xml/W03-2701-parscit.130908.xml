The two-day workshop will focus on adaptation
and learning in intelligent interactive systems and
especially on the new and interdisciplinary tech-
niques and applications that are needed to realize
such systems. The question of dialogue manage-
ment style has become an important issue in the
field, and the workshop aims at further discussion
on how dialogue models in conversational systems
should be developed: can dialogue management
benefit from a learning strategy and, if so, will the
systems be language independent.
As we move towards systems that are more
plausibly conversational in nature we are faced
with questions and issues that concern how to
manage a dialogue. The last 30 years has seen
a range of approaches to dialogue systems from
the simplicity of Eliza (Weizenbaum 1966) —
originally a network but which we would probably
now manage with a few simple finite state rules—
on up to high functionality multi-modal systems.
As we look at the design of dialogue systems over
many years, we can ask if the underlying compo-
nents are now basically agreed and the rest is no-
tational variant or taste in logic? If we are in that
state, it may be only a sign of maturity, as in Infor-
mation Extraction (IE) when Hobbs argued suc-
cessfully about 1992 that all IE systems were then
basically isomorphic.
On one hand, the notions of adaptation and
learning have become important issues when
working with spoken interactive systems, and on
the other hand, machine learning research has ma-
tured so as to provide tools and techniques for sys-
tem designers and developers to build adaptive and
learning systems. The workshop provides a forum
for discussing how these aspects can be combined
in spoken dialogue systems, addressing especially
such questions as what kind of adaptation and
learning is necessary, desirable, and possible for
speech interface systems, and how the new learn-
ing techniques can help in achieving these goals.
As it is not only the user who should adapt to
the (limits of the) system properties, the question
that system builders and designers must also ad-
dress is where and when the system needs to adapt
to the user. One of the workshop aims is to inves-
tigate the limits and relation of the user models to
interaction models in general. Furthermore, there
are various types of architectures and frameworks
that have been proposed to accommodate adapta-
tion and learning in spoken language interfaces,
and the workshop will share experience and solu-
tions on these work.
The workshop will deal with the unique require-
ments that the adaptive and learning view-points
pose for dialogue research, interface design and
system development. It offers a platform for dis-
cussion of Dialogue Systems - a topic that is be-
coming increasingly prominent in the field of Nat-
ural Language Processing, and in particular, it will
focus on two related issues:
1. The adaptation and learning in intelligent in-
teractive systems and the techniques that are
needed to realize such systems.
2. The approaches to Dialogue Management.
In particular, whether Dialogue Management
Systems are now generic, and if not, whether
there are real differences in approach.
We would like to thank our programme com-
mittee for reviewing the submissions and helping
us to make the decisions for the final programme
We also thank the EACL Workshop chair Steven
Krauwer and the conference organisers for their
help in practical organisation. Finally, we&apos;d like
to acknowledge the European Union&apos;s Information
Society Technologies Programme under the con-
tract IST-2000-29452, DUMAS (Dynamic Uni-
versal Mobility for Adaptive Speech Interfaces)
for supporting the first three workshop organisers
in workshop organisation.
