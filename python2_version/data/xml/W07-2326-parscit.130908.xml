An existing taxonomy of Dutch cue phrases, de-
signed for use in story generation, was validated by
analysing cue phrase usage in a corpus of classical
fairy tales. The analysis led to some adaptations of
the original taxonomy.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999164375">
A taxonomy of Dutch cue phrases, used to signal
rhetorical relations between text segments, has been
developed for the generation of narratives in the Vir-
tual Storyteller project (Theune et al., 2006; Theune
et al., 2007).1 The taxonomy includes only the most
frequent cue phrases found in the Spoken Dutch
Corpus.2 Because the Spoken Dutch Corpus con-
sists largely of spontaneous speech, the taxonomy
might not be fully representative of cue phrase us-
age in the target domain of the Virtual Storyteller,
which is fairy tales. In this paper we describe a cor-
pus analysis we carried out to investigate this issue,
and we discuss the modifications we made to the
taxonomy based on the results. We also present a
preliminary comparison of cue phrase usage in di-
rect and indirect discourse in fairy tales.

<bodyText confidence="0.9991175">
The Dutch “Stichting Beleven” has a large on line
collection of Dutch translations of classical fairy
tales and fables (Stichting Beleven, 2006). They
tried to collect translations that are as true to the
stories in the original tales as possible, while avoid-
ing archaic language. Therefore, we considered this
website to be a useful source for the purpose of this
research. From the website we selected 8 fairy tales

by Aesop, 25 by Andersen and 25 by the brothers
Grimm. In the case of Aesop, this included all avail-
able stories by this author. In the cases of Andersen
and Grimm, selections were made based on the pop-
ularity of the stories on the website. This resulted in
a corpus of 97.000 words.

3 Procedure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999850344827586">
The goal of our analysis was to find out whether
the 36 cue phrases in the taxonomy of Theune et
al. (2006) were in fact among those most frequently
used in fairy tales. We also wanted to find any cue
phrases that did appear in fairy tales but were not
in the taxonomy. To identify potential cue phrases
we first collected a list of all unique words occur-
ring in the fairy tale corpus, and then determined for
each word whether it could be used as a cue phrase
by formulating one or more sentences in which the
word occurred as a cue phrase. This resulted in a list
of 85 potential cue phrases of which we wanted to
determine the frequency in the corpus. A complicat-
ing factor here was that words that are used as cue
phrases can sometimes also have a different func-
tion. Litman (1996) has labeled these two types of
occurrences with ‘discourse sense’ (when actually
used as a cue phrase) and ‘sentential sense’ (when
used as some sort of filler, noun, verb or other non-
cue phrase type of word). For example the Dutch
word ‘maar’ (but) can be used to indicate contrast
as in “Zij hadden mooie blanke gezichtjes, maar ze
waren lelijk en zwart van hart.” (They had beautiful
white faces, but their hearts were ugly and black),
but also as some sort of filler “Wacht maar, ik krijg
je nog wel!” (Just wait, I’m gonna get you yet!).
Indicators whether a potential cue phrase is used
in its sentential or discourse sense include part
of speech, the presence of collocations and ortho-

graphic markers, and the position of the cue phrase
in the utterance (Hirschberg and Litman, 1994; Lit-
man, 1996; Oates, 2000; Louwerse and Mitchell,
2003; Zufferey and Popescu-Belis, 2004). For the
potential cue phrases in our corpus, we determined
manually for each occurrence whether it was a case
of discourse or sentential use.3 In the case of dis-
course use, it was determined which relation from
the taxonomy was signalled: causal, additive, con-
trastive or temporal (or more specific subtypes of
those relations), or possibly another relation not in-
cluded in the taxonomy. This was done largely
based on intuition, but when in doubt we used a
variant of the substitutability test of Knott and Dale
(1994), allowing all substitutions that did not in-
fluence the meaning of the sentence. This was
done independently by two annotators. We did not
measure annotator agreement, but only compared
the resulting classifications, resolving any differ-
ences through discussion. A few uncertain cases
remained, so this procedure did not result in exact
counts, but it was sufficient to get a general idea of
how often the various cue phrases were used.4

4 Results and adaptation of the taxonomy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997442678571429">
Table 1 gives an overview of the frequencies of the
cue phrases in our corpus. The cue phrases from the
original taxonomy are given in italics. As can be
seen in Table 1, there are a lot of cue phrases that
only occur rarely and a few cue phrases that occur
quite often. Temporal relations seem to be signalled
much less often than additive, cause and contrast re-
lations. Some of the words that had been identified
as potential cue phrases did not occur as actual cue
phrases in the corpus at all (#cue = 0). This cate-
gory also included a few of the cue phrases from the
original taxonomy. The table also shows that some
of the newly identified cue phrases seem to be good
alternatives for less used ones that already were in
the taxonomy. For example, the word ‘toen’ (then)
is a temporal marker that was not in the original tax-
onomy but occurs very frequently in fairy tales.
The analysis did not give rise to adaptations of
the structure of the taxonomy, because most of the
3Implementing precise rules to automatically distinguish
between these cases would have been more time consuming.
Also, the use of different character encodings in the corpus hin-
dered automatic processing.
4Only for the potential cue word ‘en’ another procedure was
used: since it occurred over 4000 times in our corpus, checking
each instance by hand was infeasible. Therefore, in this case
we extrapolated from a number of random samples.
cue phrases found in the corpus could be easily fit-
ted into the existing relation (sub)categories. One
exception was the cue phrase ‘anders’ (otherwise)
which signalled an ‘Otherwise’ relation not in the
taxonomy. However, we decided not to add it to
the taxonomy because our generation system cur-
rently cannot produce this type of relation (Theune
et al., 2007). We also added a new category for
negative additives (‘evenmin’ and ‘noch’, meaning
something like ‘neither’), but we did not add these
to the taxonomy because their counts were very low
and ‘noch’ in particular is a bit archaic.
All in all, we kept the structure of the original
taxonomy as it was, but we did make some changes
in the cue phrases included in the taxonomy. For
a start, the cue phrases that did not occur in the
corpus at all were removed (‘ooit’, ‘uiteindelijk’,
‘vervolgens’ and ‘waardoor’). Secondly, some of
the cue phrases that did not occur very often and
did not seem to differ in meaning from other, more
frequent alternatives were removed: ‘en... ook’,
‘zowel... als’ (additive), ‘en’ (causal) and ‘doordat’
(involuntary cause-last).5 Also, we replaced the less
frequent cue phrase ‘plotseling’ (suddenly) by the
more frequent synonym ‘opeens’. Based on the high
counts of ‘eerst’ (first) and ‘toen’ (then), it was de-
cided to add those to the taxonomy. The cue phrases
that we kept in, or added to, the new version of the
taxonomy are shown in bold face in Table 1.

5 Direct vs. indirect discourse
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968529411765">
It has been noted that cue phrase usage differs be-
tween monologues and dialogues (Louwerse and
Mitchell, 2003). Since in addition to just descrip-
tive, indirect discourse, fairy tales tend to have
pieces of direct speech in them (e.g., “What big ears
you have, grandma”), we carried out an additional
small-scale investigation to find out if there were
any differences between those two text types in our
corpus. For this study we selected 20 fairy tales that
contained at least 5 lines of direct discourse and split
them into collections of direct and indirect discourse
(8.493 and 24.967 words respectively).
The cue phrase frequencies in these collections
are summarised in Table 2. Because we had about
three times as much data for indirect discourse, for a
fair comparison we used relative counts here (num-
ber of occurrences every 10.000 words) instead of

<footnote confidence="0.927679">
5We regard the (equally frequent) cause-first version of
‘doordat’ as the preferred alternative, because mentioning the
cause first makes the generated stories easier to read.

absolute numbers. Since the total number of cue
phrases was much smaller than in the full corpus,
the ranges used in Table 2 were adapted accordingly.
The cue phrases with #cue &lt; 0 in Table 1 were left
out since they would only meaninglessly clutter up
the table. Still, quite a number of cue phrases that
did appear in the total collection of fairy tales, did
not occur in the selection of 20 fairy tales used here.
Table 2 shows that the most frequent cue phrases
from the overall collection, also occur most often in
both direct and indirect discourse. An exception is
‘omdat’ (because), which occurs more often in in-
direct than direct discourse. This is consistent with
research by Degand and Pander Maat (2003) show-
ing that the alternative ‘want’ is preferred when the
speaker is somehow personally involved with the
action being described (which is more typically the
case in direct speech). Furthermore, in indirect dis-
course more cue phrases are used than in direct dis-
course. Responsible for this difference are mostly
the less common causal cue phrases and temporal
cue phrases. This can be explained intuitively by
the difference in nature between direct and indirect
discourse. When characters in a story engage in
conversation, they are likely to discuss simple, cur-
rent events without using elaborate language. But in
narrating a story, a number of events is summed up
mentioning actions, consequences, causes and tem-
poral span. All in all, our findings are in line with
earlier research, but the small number of data does
not allow us to draw substantial conclusions.

6 Concluding remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997740740741">
We carried out an analysis of cue phrase usage in
fairy tales in order to validate a cue phrase taxon-
omy for story generation in Dutch. This led to some
modifications of the taxonomy such as leaving out
the least frequent phrases and replacing others by
more frequent alternatives. Limiting the taxonomy
in this way to a small number of the most common
cue phrases could make the generated stories easier
to read (Williams and Reiter, 2005), but on the other
hand it could also make them more boring (Knott
and Dale, 1994). However, the adapted taxonomy
seems to contain a sufficient number of alternatives
for each cue phrase to limit the latter risk, as we
hope to show during future evaluations.
Although differences in cue phrase usage be-
tween different text types are to be expected, the
limited extent to which modifications to the taxon-
omy were necessary shows that the difference be-
tween cue phrase usage in the Spoken Dutch Cor-
pus and cue phrase usage in classical fairy tales is
quite small. This indicates that the taxonomy is us-
able for a broader scale of texts than just fairy tale-
like stories. However, when comparing direct and
indirect discourse in fairy tales, some differences
surface that might indicate a need for different tax-
onomies for both kinds of discourse. A larger scale
study is needed to further investigate this.

The cue phrases that we kept in, or added to, the new version of the taxonomy are shown in bold face in Table 1. 5 Direct vs. indirect discourse It has been noted that cue phrase usage differs between monologues and dialogues (Louwerse and Mitchell, 2003). Since in addition to just descriptive, indirect discourse, fairy tales tend to have pieces of direct speech in them (e.g., “What big ears you have, grandma”), we carried out an additional small-scale investigation to find out if there were any differences between those two text types in our corpus. For this study we selected 20 fairy tales that contained at least 5 lines of direct discourse and split them into collections of direct and indirect discourse (8.493 and 24.967 words respectively). The cue phrase frequencies in these collections are summarised in Table 2. Because we had about thre</context>

To identify potential cue phrases we first collected a list of all unique words occurring in the fairy tale corpus, and then determined for each word whether it could be used as a cue phrase by formulating one or more sentences in which the word occurred as a cue phrase. This resulted in a list of 85 potential cue phrases of which we wanted to determine the frequency in the corpus. A complicating factor here was that words that are u</context>

Therefore, in this case we extrapolated from a number of random samples. cue phrases found in the corpus could be easily fitted into the existing relation (sub)categories. One exception was the cue phrase ‘anders’ (otherwise) which signalled an ‘Otherwise’ relation not in the taxonomy. However, we decided not to add it to the taxonomy because our generation system currently cannot produce this type of relation (Theune et al., 2007). We also added a new category for negative additives (‘evenmin’ and ‘noch’, meaning something like ‘neither’), but we did not add these to the taxonomy because their counts were very low and ‘noch’ in particular is a bit archaic. All in all, we kept the structure of the original taxonomy as it was, but we did make some changes in the cue phrases included in the taxonomy. For a start, the cue phrases that did not occur in the corpus at all were removed (‘ooit’, ‘uiteindelijk’, ‘vervolgens’ and ‘waardoor’).

All in all, our findings are in line with earlier research, but the small number of data does not allow us to draw substantial conclusions. 6 Concluding remarks We carried out an analysis of cue phrase usage in fairy tales in order to validate a cue phrase taxonomy for story generation in Dutch. This led to some modifications of the taxonomy such as leaving out the least frequent phrases and replacing others by more frequent alternatives. Limiting the taxonomy in this way to a small number of the most common cue phrases could make the generated stories easier to read (Williams and Reiter, 2005), but on the other hand it could also make them more boring (Knott and Dale, 1994). However, the adapted taxonomy seems to contain a sufficient number of alternatives for each cue phrase to limit the latter risk, as we hope to show during future evaluations. Although differences in cue phrase usage between different text types are to be expected, the limited extent to which modifications to the taxonomy were necessary shows that the difference between cue phrase usage in the Spoken Dutch Corpus and cue phrase usage in classical fairy tales is quite small. This indicates that the taxonomy is us</context>
