Reordering is a serious challenge in sta-
tistical machine translation. We propose
a method for analysing syntactic reorder-
ing in parallel corpora and apply it to un-
derstanding the differences in the perfor-
mance of SMT systems. Results at recent
large-scale evaluation campaigns show
that synchronous grammar-based statisti-
cal machine translation models produce
superior results for language pairs such as
Chinese to English. However, for language
pairs such as Arabic to English, phrase-
based approaches continue to be competi-
tive. Until now, our understanding of these
results has been limited to differences in
BLEU scores. Our analysis shows that cur-
rent state-of-the-art systems fail to capture
the majority of reorderings found in real
data.

1 Introduction

Reordering is a major challenge in statistical ma-
chine translation. Reordering involves permuting
the relative word order from source sentence to
translation in order to account for systematic dif-
ferences between languages. Correct word order is
important not only for the fluency of output, it also
affects word choice and the overall quality of the
translations.
In this paper we present an automatic method
for characterising syntactic reordering found in a
parallel corpus. This approach allows us to analyse
reorderings quantitatively, based on their number
and span, and qualitatively, based on their relation-
ship to the parse tree of one sentence. The methods
we introduce are generally applicable, only requir-
ing an aligned parallel corpus with a parse over the
source or the target side, and can be extended to
allow for more than one reference sentence and
derivations on both source and target sentences.
Using this method, we are able to compare the re-
ordering capabilities of two important translation
systems: a phrase-based model and a hierarchical
model.
Phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004;
Koehn et al., 2003) have been a major paradigm
in statistical machine translation in the last few
years, showing state-of-the-art performance for
many language pairs. They search all possible re-
orderings within a restricted window, and their
output is guided by the language model and a
lexicalised reordering model (Och et al., 2004),
both of which are local in scope. However, the
lack of structure in phrase-based models makes it
very difficult to model long distance movement of
words between languages.
Synchronous grammar models can encode
structural mappings between languages which al-
low complex, long distance reordering. Some
grammar-based models such as the hierarchical
model (Chiang, 2005) and the syntactified target
language phrases model (Marcu et al., 2006) have
shown better performance than phrase-based mod-
els on certain language pairs.
To date our understanding of the variation in re-
ordering performance between phrase-based and
synchronous grammar models has been limited to
relative BLEU scores. However, Callison-Burch et
al. (2006) showed that BLEU score alone is insuffi-
cient for comparing reordering as it only measures
a partial ordering on n-grams. There has been little
direct research on empirically evaluating reorder-
ing.
We evaluate the reordering characteristics of
these two paradigms on Chinese-English and
Arabic-English translation. Our main findings are
as follows: (1) Chinese-English parallel sentences
exhibit many medium and long-range reorderings,
but less short range ones than Arabic-English, (2)
phrase-based models account for short-range re-
orderings better than hierarchical models do, (3)

by contrast, hierarchical models clearly outper-
form phrase-based models when there is signif-
icant medium-range reordering, and (4) none of
these systems adequately deal with longer range
reordering.
Our analysis provides a deeper understand-
ing of why hierarchical models demonstrate bet-
ter performance for Chinese-English translation,
and also why phrase-based approaches do well at
Arabic-English.
We begin by reviewing related work in Sec-
tion 2. Section 3 describes our method for ex-
tracting and measuring reorderings in aligned and
parsed parallel corpora. We apply our techniques
to human aligned parallel treebank sentences in
Section 4, and to machine translation outputs in
Section 5. We summarise our findings in Section 6.

There are few empirical studies of reordering be-
haviour in the statistical machine translation lit-
erature. Fox (2002) showed that many common
reorderings fall outside the scope of synchronous
grammars that only allow the reordering of child
nodes. This study was performed manually and
did not compare different language pairs or trans-
lation paradigms. There are some comparative
studies of the reordering restrictions that can be
imposed on the phrase-based or grammar-based
models (Zens and Ney, 2003; Wellington et al.,
2006), however these do not look at the reordering
performance of the systems. Chiang et al. (2005)
proposed a more fine-grained method of compar-
ing the output of two translation systems by us-
ing the frequency of POS sequences in the output.
This method is a first step towards a better under-
standing of comparative reordering performance,
but neglects the question of what kind of reorder-
ing is occurring in corpora and in translation out-
put.
Zollmann et al. (2008) performed an empiri-
cal comparison of the BLEU score performance
of hierarchical models with phrase-based models.
They tried to ascertain which is the stronger model
under different reordering scenarios by varying
distortion limits the strength of language models.
They show that the hierarchical models do slightly
better for Chinese-English systems, but worse for
Arabic-English. However, there was no analysis of
the reorderings existing in their parallel corpora,
or on what kinds of reorderings were produced in
their output. We perform a focused evaluation of
these issues.
Birch et al. (2008) proposed a method for ex-
tracting reorderings from aligned parallel sen-
tences. We extend this method in order to constrain
the reorderings to a derivation over the source sen-
tence where possible.

3 Measuring Reordering
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999902565217391">
Reordering is largely driven by syntactic differ-
ences between languages and can involve complex
rearrangements between nodes in synchronous
trees. Modeling reordering exactly would be
sparse and heterogeneous and thus we make an
important simplifying assumption in order for the
detection and extraction of reordering data to be
tractable and useful. We assume that reordering
is a binary process occurring between two blocks
that are adjacent in the source. We extend the
methods proposed by Birch et al. (2008) to iden-
tify and measure reordering. Modeling reordering
as the inversion in order of two adjacent blocks is
similar to the approach taken by the Inverse Trans-
duction Model (ITG) (Wu, 1997), except that here
we are not limited to a binary tree. We also detect
and include non-syntactic reorderings as they con-
stitute a significant proportion of the reorderings.
Birch et al. (2008) defined the extraction pro-
cess for a sentence pair that has been word aligned.
This method is simple, efficient and applicable to
all aligned sentence pairs. However, if we have ac-
cess to the syntax tree, we can more accurately
determine the groupings of embedded reorder-
ings, and we can also access interesting informa-
tion about the reordering such as the type of con-
stituents that get reordered. Figure 1 shows the
advantage of using syntax to guide the extraction
process. Embedded reorderings that are extracted
without syntax assume a right branching structure.
Reorderings that are extracted using the syntac-
tic extraction algorithm reflect the correct sentence
structure. We thus extend the algorithm to extract-
ing syntactic reorderings. We require that syntac-
tic reorderings consist of blocks of whole sibling
nodes in a syntactic tree over the source sentence.
In Figure 2 we can see a sentence pair with an
alignment and a parse tree over the source. We per-
form a depth first recursion through the tree, ex-
tracting the reorderings that occur between whole
sibling nodes. Initially a reordering is detected be-
tween the leaf nodes P and NN. The block growing
algorithm described in Birch et al. (2008) is then
used to grow block A to include NT and NN, and
block B to include P and NR. The source and tar-
get spans of these nodes do not overlap the spans

of any other nodes, and so the reordering is ac-
cepted. The same happens for the higher level re-
ordering where block A covers NP-TMP and PP-
DIR, and block B covers the VP. In cases where
the spans do overlap spans of nodes that are not
siblings, these reorderings are then extracted us-
ing the algorithm described in Birch et al. (2008)
without constraining them to the parse tree. These
non-syntactic reorderings constitute about 10% of
the total reorderings and they are a particular chal-
lenge to models which can only handle isomorphic
structures.
RQuantity
The reordering extraction technique allows us to
analyse reorderings in corpora according to the
distribution of reordering widths and syntactic
types. In order to facilitate the comparison of dif-
ferent corpora, we combine statistics about in-
dividual reorderings into a sentence level metric
which is then averaged over a corpus. This met-
ric is defined using reordering widths over the tar-
get side to allow experiments with multiple lan-
guage pairs to be comparable when the common
language is the target.
We use the average RQuantity (Birch et al.,
2008) as our measure of the amount of reordering
in a parallel corpus. It is defined as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.895625">
RQuantity = ErER  |rAt  |+  |rBt
I
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.934316666666667">
where R is the set of reorderings for a sentence,
I is the target sentence length, A and B are the
two blocks involved in the reordering, and |rA3|
is the size or span of block A on the target side.
RQuantity is thus the sum of the spans of all the
reordering blocks on the target side, normalised

by the length of the target sentence. The minimum
RQuantity for a sentence would be 0. The max-
imum RQuantity occurs where the order of the
sentence is completely inverted and the RQuantity
is Ei 2 i. See, for example, Figure 1 where the
RQuantity is 9�.

Characterising the reordering present in different
human generated parallel corpora is crucial to un-
derstanding the kinds of reordering we must model
in our translations. We first need to extract reorder-
ings for which we need alignments and deriva-
tions. We could use automatically generated an-
notations, however these contain errors and could
be biased towards the models which created them.
The GALE project has provided gold standard
word alignments for Arabic-English (AR-EN) and
Chinese-English (CH-EN) sentences.1 A subset of
these sentences come from the Arabic and Chi-
nese treebanks, which provide gold standard parse
trees. The subsets of parallel data for which we

Figure 3 shows that the different corpora have
very different reordering characteristics. The CH-
EN corpus displays about three times the amount
of reordering (RQuantity) than the AR-EN cor-
pus. For CH-EN, the RQuantity increases with
sentence length and for AR-EN, it remains con-
stant. This seems to indicate that for longer CH-
EN sentences there are larger reorderings, but this
is not the case for AR-EN. RQuantity is low for
very short sentences, which indicates that these
sentences are not representative of the reordering
characteristics of a corpus. The measures seem
to stabilise for sentences with lengths of over 20
words.
The average amount of reordering is interesting,
but it is also important to look at the distribution
of reorderings involved. Figure 4 shows the re-
orderings in the CH-EN and AR-EN corpora bro-

ken down by the total width of the source span
of the reorderings. The figure clearly shows how
different the two language pairs are in terms of
reordering widths. Compared to the CH-EN lan-
guage pair, the distribution of reorderings in AR-
EN has many more reorderings over short dis-
tances, but many fewer medium or long distance
reorderings. We define short, medium or long dis-
tance reorderings to mean that they have a reorder-
ing of width of between 2 to 4 words, 5 to 8 and
more than 8 words respectively.
Syntactic reorderings can reveal very rich
language-specific reordering behaviour. Figure 5
is an example of the kinds of data that can be used
to improve reordering models. In this graph we se-
lected the four syntactic types that were involved
in the largest number of reorderings. They cov-
ered the block that was moved forward in the tar-
get (block A). We can see that different syntactic
types display quite different behaviour at different
reordering widths and this could be important to
model.
Having now characterised the space of reorder-
ing actually found in parallel data, we now turn
to the question of how well our translation models
account for them. As both the translation models
investigated in this work do not use syntax, in the
following sections we focus on non-syntactic anal-
ysis.

system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) (with lexi-

ero (Chiang, 2007). We use default settings for
both models: a distortion limit of seven for Moses,
and a maximum source span limit of 10 words for
Hiero. We trained both models on subsets of the
NIST 2008 data sets, consisting mainly of news
data, totalling 547,420 CH-EN and 1,069,658 AR-
EN sentence pairs. We used a trigram language
model on the entire English side (211M words)

pus. Minimum error rate training was performed
on the 2002 NIST test for CH-EN, and the 2004

5.1 Reordering Test Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968296296296">
In order to determine what effect reordering has
on translation, we extract a test corpus with spe-
cific reordering characteristics from the manually
aligned and parsed sentences described in Sec-
tion 4. To minimise the impact of sentence length,
we select sentences with target lengths from 20 to
39 words inclusive. In this range RQuantity is sta-
ble. From these sentences we first remove those
with no detected reorderings, and we then divide
up the remaining sentences into three sets of equal
sizes based on the RQuantity of each sentence. We
label these test sets: “none”, “low”, “medium” and
“high”.
All test sentences have only one reference En-
glish sentence. MT evaluations using one refer-
ence cannot make strong claims about any partic-
ular test sentence, but are still valid when used to
compare large numbers of hypotheses.
Table 1 and Figure 6 show the reordering char-
acteristics of the test sets. As expected, we see
more reordering for Chinese-English than for Ara-
bic to English.
It is important to note that although we might
name a set “low” or “high”, this is only relative
to the other groups for the same language pair.
The “high” AR-EN set, has a lower RQuantity
than the “medium” CH-EN set. Figure 6 shows

BLEU score performance of the systems.
In Figure 7 we see that the hierarchical model
performs considerably better than Moses on the
“medium” CH-EN set, although the confidence
interval for these results overlap somewhat. This
supports the claim that Hiero is better able to cap-
ture longer distance reorderings than Moses.
Hiero performs significantly worse than Moses
on the “none” and “low” sets for CH-EN, and
for all the AR-EN sets, other than “none”. All
these sets have a relatively low amount of reorder-
ing, and in particular a low number of medium
and long distance reorderings. The phrase-based
model could be performing better because it
searches all possible permutations within a certain
window whereas the hierarchical model will only
permit reorderings for which there is lexical evi-
dence in the training corpus. Within a small win-
dow, this exhaustive search could discover the best
reorderings, but within a bigger window, the more
constrained search of the hierarchical model pro-
duces better results. It is interesting that Hiero is
not always the best choice for translation perfor-
mance, and depending on the amount of reorder-
ing and the distribution of reorderings, the simpler
phrase-based approach is better.
The fact that both models show equally poor
performance on the “high” RQuantity test set sug-
gests that the hierarchical model has no advantage
over the phrase-based model when the reorder-
ings are long enough and frequent enough. Nei-
ther Moses nor Hiero can perform long distance
reorderings, due to the local constraints placed on
their search which allows performance to be lin-
ear with respect to sentence length. Increasing the
window in which these models are able to perform
reorderings does not necessarily improve perfor-

els must discriminate amongst.
The performance of both systems on the “high”
test set could be much worse than the BLEU score
would suggest. A long distance reordering that has
been missed, would only be penalised by BLEU
once at the join of the two blocks, even though it
might have a serious impact on the comprehension
of the translation. This flaw seriously limits the
conclusions that we can draw from BLEU score,
and motivates analysing translations specifically
for reordering as we do in this paper.

At best, BLEU can only partially reflect the re-
ordering performance of the systems. We therefore
perform an analysis of the distribution of reorder-
ings that are present in the systems’ outputs, in or-
der to compare them with each other and with the
source-reference distribution.
For each hypothesis translation, we record
which source words and phrase pairs or rules were
used to produce which target words. From this we
create an alignment matrix from which reorder-
ings are extracted in the same manner as previ-
ously done for the manually aligned corpora.
Figure 9 shows the distribution of reorderings
that occur between the source sentence and the
translations from the phrase-based model. This
graph is interesting when compared with Figure 6,
which shows the reorderings that exist in the orig-
inal reference sentence pair. The two distribu-
tions are quite different. Firstly, as the models use
phrases which are treated as blocks, reorderings
which occur within a phrase are not recorded. This
reduces the number of shorter distance reorder-
ings in the distribution in Figure 6, as mainly short

translations than in the references, and there are
no long distance reorderings.
It is interesting that the phrase-based model is
able to capture the fact that reordering increases
with the RQuantity of the test set. Looking at the
equivalent data for the AR-EN language pair, a
similar pattern emerges: there are many fewer re-
orderings in the translations than in the references.
Figure 10 shows the reorderings from the output
of the hierarchical model. The results are very dif-
ferent to both the phrase-based model output (Fig-
ure 9) and to the original reference reordering dis-
tribution (Figure 6). There are fewer reorderings
here than even in the phrase-based output. How-
ever, the Hiero output has a slightly higher BLEU
score than the Moses output. The number of re-
orderings is clearly not the whole story. Part of the
reason why the output seems to have few reorder-
ings and yet scores well, is that the output of hier-
archical models does not lend itself to the analysis
that we have performed successfully on the ref-
erence or phrase-based translation sentence pairs.
This is because the output has a large number of
non-contiguous phrases which prevent the extrac-
tion of reorderings from within their span. Only
4.6% of phrase-based words were blocked off due
to non-contiguous phrases but 47.5% of the hier-
archical words were. This problem can be amelio-
rated with the detection and unaligning of words
which are obviously dependent on other words in
the non-contiguous phrase.
Even taking blocked off phrases into account,
however, the number of reorderings in the hierar-

chical output is still low, especially for the medium
and long distance reorderings, as compared to the

Comparing distributions of reorderings is inter-
esting, but it cannot approach the question of how
many reorderings the system performed correctly.
In this section we identify individual reorderings
in the source and reference sentences and detect
whether or not they have been reproduced in the
translation.
Each reordering in the original test set is ex-
tracted. Then the source-translation alignment is
inspected to determine whether the blocks in-
volved in the original reorderings are in the reverse
order in the translation. If so, we say that these re-
orderings have been retained from the reference to
the translation.
If a reordering has been translated by one phrase
pair, we assume that the reordering has been re-
tained, because the reordering could exist inside
the phrase. If the segmentation is slightly differ-
ent, but a reordering of the correct size occurred at
the right place, it is also considered to be retained.
Figure 11 shows that the hierarchical model
retains more reorderings of all widths than the
phrase-based system. Both systems retain few re-
orderings, with the phrase-based model missing
almost all the medium distance reorderings, and
both models failing on all the long distance re-

Targeted Manual Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998275">
The relationship between targeted evaluation
and the correct reordering of the translation still
needs to be established. The translation system can
compensate for not retaining a reordering by us-
ing different lexical items. To judge the relevance
of the targeted evaluation we need to perform a
manual evaluation. We present evaluators with the
reference and the translation sentences. We mark
the target ranges of the blocks that are involved
in the particular reordering we are analysing, and
ask the evaluator if the reordering in the translation
is correct, incorrect or not applicable. The not ap-
plicable case is chosen when the translated words
are so different from the reference that their order-
ing is irrelevant. There were three evaluators who
each judged 25 CH-EN reorderings which were re-
tained and 25 CH-EN reorderings which were not
retained by the Moses translation model.
The results in Table 2 show that the retained
reorderings are generally judged to be correct. If
the reordering is not retained, then the evaluators
divided their judgements evenly between the re-
ordering being correct or incorrect. It seems that
the fact that a reordering is not retained does in-
dicate that its ordering is more likely to be incor-
rect. We used Fleiss’ Kappa to measure the cor-
relation between annotators. It expresses the ex-
tent to which the amount of agreement between
raters is greater than what would be expected if
all raters made their judgements randomly. In this
case Fleiss’ kappa is 0.357 which is considered to
be a fair correlation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999507095238095">
In this paper we have introduced a general and
extensible automatic method for the quantitative
analyse of syntactic reordering phenomena in par-
allel corpora.
We have applied our method to a systematic
analysis of reordering both in the training corpus,
and in the output, of two state-of-the-art transla-
tion models. We show that the hierarchical model
performs better than the phrase-based model in sit-
uations where there are many medium distance re-
orderings. In addition, we find that the choice of
translation model must be guided by the type of re-
orderings in the language pair, as the phrase-based
model outperforms the hierarchical model when
there is a predominance of short distance reorder-
ings. However, neither model is able to capture the
reordering behaviour of the reference corpora ad-
equately. These result indicate that there is still
much research to be done if statistical machine
translation systems are to capture the full range of
reordering phenomena present in translation.

We propose a method for analysing syntactic reordering in parallel corpora and apply it to understanding the differences in the performance of SMT systems. Results at recent large-scale evaluation campaigns show that synchronous grammar-based statistical machine translation models produce superior results for language pairs such as Chinese to English. However, for language pairs such as Arabic to English, phrasebased approaches continue to be competitive. Until now, our understanding of these results has been limited to differences in Our analysis shows that current state-of-the-art systems fail to capture the majority of reorderings found in real data.</abstract>

They show that the hierarchical models do slightly better for Chinese-English systems, but worse for Arabic-English. However, there was no analysis of the reorderings existing in their parallel corpora, or on what kinds of reorderings were produced in their output. We perform a focused evaluation of these issues. Birch et al. (2008) proposed a method for extracting reorderings from aligned parallel sentences. We extend this method in order to constrain the reorderings to a derivation over the source sentence where possible. 3 Measuring Reordering Reordering is largely driven by syntactic differences between languages and can involve complex rearrangements between nodes in synchronous trees. Modeling reordering exactly would be sparse and heterogeneous and thus we make an important simplifying assumption in order for the detection and extraction of reordering data to be tractable and useful.

We thus extend the algorithm to extracting syntactic reorderings. We require that syntactic reorderings consist of blocks of whole sibling nodes in a syntactic tree over the source sentence. In Figure 2 we can see a sentence pair with an alignment and a parse tree over the source. We perform a depth first recursion through the tree, extracting the reorderings that occur between whole sibling nodes. Initially a reordering is detected between the leaf nodes P and NN. The block growing algorithm described in Birch et al. (2008) is then used to grow block A to include NT and NN, and block B to include P and NR. The source and target spans of these nodes do not overlap the spans 198 Figure 1.

RQuantity The reordering extraction technique allows us to analyse reorderings in corpora according to the distribution of reordering widths and syntactic types. In order to facilitate the comparison of different corpora, we combine statistics about individual reorderings into a sentence level metric which is then averaged over a corpus. This metric is defined using reordering widths over the target side to allow experiments with multiple language pairs to be comparable when the common language is the target. We use the average RQuantity (Birch et al., 2008) as our measure of the amount of reordering in a parallel corpus. It is defined as follows: RQuantity = ErER |rAt |+ |rBt I where R is the set of reorderings for a sentence, I is the target sentence length, A and B are the two blocks involved in the reordering, and |rA3| is the size or span of block A on the target side. RQuantity is thus the sum of the spans of all the reordering blocks on the target side, normalised Figure 2. A sentence pair from the test corpus, with its alignment and parse tree.

We use default settings for both models: a distortion limit of seven for Moses, and a maximum source span limit of 10 words for Hiero. We trained both models on subsets of the NIST 2008 data sets, consisting mainly of news data, totalling 547,420 CH-EN and 1,069,658 AREN sentence pairs. We used a trigram language model on the entire English side (211M words) of the NIST 2008 Chinese-English training corpus.

The AR-EN sets show similar differences in reordering behaviour. 5.2 Performance on Test Sets In this section we compare the translation output for the phrase-based and the hierarchical system for different reordering scenarios. We use the test sets created in Section 5.1 to explicitly isolate the effect reordering has on the performance of two translation systems. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the BLEU score results of the phrase-based model and the hierarchical model on the different reordering test sets. The 95% confidence intervals as calculated by bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004) are shown for each of the results. We can see that the models show quite different behaviour for the different test sets and for the different language pairs.

They search all possible reorderings within a restricted window, and their output is guided by the language model and a lexicalised reordering model (Och et al., 2004), both of which are local in scope. However, the lack of structure in phrase-based models makes it very difficult to model long distance movement of words between languages. Synchronous grammar models can encode structural mappings between languages which allow complex, long distance reordering. Some grammar-based models such as the hierarchical model (Chiang, 2005) and the syntactified target language phrases model (Marcu et al., 2006) have shown better performance than phrase-based models on certain language pairs. To date our understanding of the variation in reordering performance between phrase-based and synchronous grammar models has been limited to relative BLEU scores. However, Callison-Burch et al. (2006) showed that BLEU score alone is insufficient for comparing reordering as it only measures a partial ordering on n-grams. There has been little direct research on empirically evaluating reordering. We evaluate the reordering characteristics of these two paradigms on Chinese-English and Arabic-English translation.

The methods we introduce are generally applicable, only requiring an aligned parallel corpus with a parse over the source or the target side, and can be extended to allow for more than one reference sentence and derivations on both source and target sentences. Using this method, we are able to compare the reordering capabilities of two important translation systems: a phrase-based model and a hierarchical model. Phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) have been a major paradigm in statistical machine translation in the last few years, showing state-of-the-art performance for many language pairs. They search all possible reorderings within a restricted window, and their output is guided by the language model and a lexicalised reordering model (Och et al., 2004), both of which are local in scope.

Modeling reordering exactly would be sparse and heterogeneous and thus we make an important simplifying assumption in order for the detection and extraction of reordering data to be tractable and useful. We assume that reordering is a binary process occurring between two blocks that are adjacent in the source. We extend the methods proposed by Birch et al. (2008) to identify and measure reordering. Modeling reordering as the inversion in order of two adjacent blocks is similar to the approach taken by the Inverse Transduction Model (ITG) (Wu, 1997), except that here we are not limited to a binary tree. We also detect and include non-syntactic reorderings as they constitute a significant proportion of the reorderings. Birch et al. (2008) defined the extraction process for a sentence pair that has been word aligned. This method is simple, efficient and applicable to all aligned sentence pairs. However, if we have access to the syntax tree, we can more accurately determine the groupings of embedded reorderings, and we can also access interesting information about the reordering such as the type of constituents that get reordered.
