We present the Heart of Gold mid-
dleware by demonstrating three XML-
based integration scenarios where multi-
dimensional markup produced online by
multilingual natural language processing
(NLP) components is combined to deliver
rich, robust linguistic markup for use in
NLP-based applications like information
extraction, question answering and seman-
tic web. The scenarios include (1) robust
deep-shallow integration, (2) shallow pro-
cessing cascades, and (3) treebank storage
of multi-dimensionally annotated texts.

1 Introduction and Motivation

<bodyText confidence="0.999631086956522">
Heart of Gold is a middleware architecture for cre-
ating and combining markup produced by mul-
tiple natural language processing components in
multilingual environments. It was initially devel-
oped for a special sort of multi-dimensional an-
notation, namely application-oriented, XML- and
XSLT-based online integration of various shallow
NLP components with a deep HPSG parser for in-
creased robustness in the hybrid natural language
processing paradigm (Callmeier et al., 2004).
The middleware, however, can also be used for
various other online and offline tasks related to
multi-dimensional markup creation and integra-
tion. These comprise automatic corpus annotation,
incorporation of multi-dimensional markup into a
single XML representation, and NLP component
cascades interleaved with XSL annotation trans-
formation. The middleware provides XML-RPC
interfaces for simple, networking-enabled and
programming language-independent application
and component integration. Heart of Gold is avail-
able as one of the DELPH-IN open source tools
available from http://www.delph-in.net1.

Fig. 1 gives a schematic overview of the middle-
ware server in between applications (above) and
external NLP components (below). When a new
application session in Heart of Gold is started, it
takes a configuration specifying NLP components
to start for the session. Each component is started
according to its own parameterized configuration.

NLP components are then queried in a numerically
defined processing order (‘Depth’ in Fig. 4). The
shallowest components (e.g. tokenizer) are as-
signed a low number and are started first etc. The
output of each component must be XML markup.
Each component gets the output of the previous
component as input by default, but can also re-
quest (via configuration) other annotations as in-
put. Components may produce multiple output
annotations (e.g. in different formats). Thus, the

The resulting multi-dimensional annotations are
stored in a per-session markup storage (Fig. 2)
that groups all annotations for an input query (a
sentence or text) in annotation collections. The
markup storage can also be made persistent by
saving it to XML files or to an XML database.

the form hog://sid/acid/aid in XPath expres-
sions where sid is a session ID, acid is an anno-
tation collection ID and aid is an annotation iden-
tifier typically signifying the name of the produc-
ing component. Structured metadata like configu-
ration and processing parameters (e.g. processing
time and date, language ID etc.) are always stored
within the annotation markup as first root daughter
element.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979735">
2.2 XML standoff markup as first-class citizen
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992746875">
Unlike other NLP architectures (e.g. GATE (Cun-
ningham et al., 2002) etc.), Heart of Gold treats
XML standoff annotations (Thompson and McK-
elvie, 1997) as first class citizens and natively sup-
ports XML (and only XML) markup of any kind.
Moreover, Heart of Gold does not prescribe spe-
cific DTDs or Schemata for annotations, provided
that the markup is well-formed. In this sense, it
is a completely open framework that may how-
ever be constrained by requirements of the actu-
ally configured components. The advantage of
this openness is easy integration of new compo-
nents. Mappings need only be defined for the
immediately depending annotations (see next sec-
tion) which is by far not an n-to-n mapping in prac-
tical applications.
However, the fact that a specific DTD or
Schema is not imposed by the middleware does
not mean that there are no minimal requirements.
Linking between different standoff annotations is
only possible on the basis of a least common en-
tity, which we propose to be the character spans in
the original text2. Moreover, we additionally pro-
pose the use of the XML ID/IDREF mechanism to
facilitate efficient integration and combination of
multi-dimensional markup.
Finally, depending on the scenario, specific
common, standardized markup formats are appro-
priate, an example is RMRS (Copestake, 2003) for
deep-shallow integration in Section 3 or the XML-
encoded typed feature structure markup generated
by SProUT (Dro˙zd˙zy´nski et al., 2004).

2.3 XSLT as ’glue’ and query language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999890484848485">
We propose and Heart of Gold heavily relies on the
use of XSLT for combining and integrating multi-
dimensional XML markup. The general idea has
already been presented in (Sch¨afer, 2003), but the
developments and experiences since then have en-
couraged us to proceed in that direction and Heart
of Gold can be considered as a successful, more
elaborated proof of concept. The idea is related
to the open markup format framework presented
above: XSLT can be used to transform XML to
other XML formats, or to combine and query an-
notations. In particular, XSLT stylesheets may re-
solve conflicts resulting from multi-dimensional
markup, choose among alternative readings, fol-
low standoff links, or decide which markup source
to give higher preference.
(Carletta et al., 2003), e.g. propose the NXT
Search query language that extends XPath by
adding query variables, regular expressions, quan-
tification and special support for querying tem-
poral and structural relations. Their main argu-
ment against standard XPath is that it is impossi-
ble to constrain both structural and temporal re-
lations within a single XPath query. Our argu-
ment is that XSLT can complement XPath where
XPath alone is not powerful enough, yet providing
a standardized language. Further advantages we
see in the XSLT approach are portability and effi-
ciency (in contrast to ‘proprietary’ and slow XPath
extensions like NXT), while it has a quite sim-
ple syntax in its (currently employed) 1.0 version.
XSLT can be conceived as a declarative specifi-
cation language as long as an XML tree structure

is preserved (not necessarily fully isomorphic to
the input structure). However, XSLT is Turing-
capable and therefore suited to solve in princi-
ple any markup integration or query problem. Fi-
nally, extensions like the upcoming XSLT/XPath
2.0 version or efficiency gains through XSLTC
(translet compilation) can be taken on-the-fly and
for free without giving up compatibility. Tech-
nically, the built-in Heart of Gold XSLT proces-
sor could easily replaced or complemented by an
XQuery processor. However, for the combination
and transformation of NLP markup, we see no ad-
vantage of XQuery over XSLT.
Heart of Gold comes with a built-in XSL trans-
formation service, and module adapters (Sec-
tion 2.4) can easily implement transformation sup-
port by including a few lines of code. Stylesheets
can also be generated automatically in Heart of
Gold, provided a systematic description of the
transformation input format is available. An
example is mapping from named entity gram-
mar output type definitions in scenario 1 below.
Stylesheets are also employed to visualize the lin-
guistic markup, e.g. by transforming RMRS to
HTML (Fig. 3) or LATEX.

2.4 Integrated NLP components

<bodyText confidence="0.991150285714286">
NLP components are integrated through adapters
called modules (either Java-based, subprocesses or
via XML-RPC) that are also responsible for gener-
ating XML standoff output if this is not supported
natively by the components (e.g., TnT, Chunkie).
Various shallow and deep NLP components have
already been integrated, cf. Fig. 4.

3 Scenario 1: Deep-Shallow Integration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999081090909091">
The idea of hybrid deep-shallow integration is to
provide robust linguistic analyses through multi-
dimensional NLP markup created by shallow and
deep components, e.g. those listed in Fig. 4. Ro-
bustness is achieved in two ways: (1) various
shallow components perform preprocessing and
partial statistical disambiguation (e.g. PoS tag-
ging of unknown words, named entity recognition)
that can be used by a deep parser by means of
a so-called XML input chart (multi-dimensional
markup combined through XSLT in a single XML
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997344">

<bodyText confidence="0.99877547368421">
document in a format convenient for the parser).
(2) shallow component’s output is transformed
through XSLT to partial semantic representations
in RMRS syntax (Copestake, 2003) that is poten-
tially more fine-grained and structured than what
is digestible by the deep parser as preprocessing
input (mainly PoS/NE type and span information
via the XML input chart). This allows for (a) a
fallback to the shallow representation in case deep
parsing fails (e.g. due to ungrammatical input), (b)
combination with the RMRS generated by deep
parsing or fragments of it in case deep parsing
fails.
First application scenarios have been investi-
gated successfully in the DEEPTHOUGHT project
(Uszkoreit et al., 2004). A further application (hy-
brid question analysis) is presented in (Frank et al.,
2006). Recently, linking to ontology instances and
concepts has been added (Sch¨afer, 2006).

4 Scenario 2: Shallow Cascades
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994638714285714">
The second scenario is described in (Frank et
al., 2004) in detail. A robust, partial semantics
representation is generated from a shallow chun-
ker’s output and morphological analysis (English
and German) by means of a processing cascade
consisting of four SProUT grammar instances
with four interleaved XSLT transformations. The
cascade is defined using the declarative system
description language SDL (Krieger, 2003). An
SDL architecture description is compiled into a
Java class which is integrated in Heart of Gold
as a sub-architecture module (Fig. 5). The sce-
nario is equally a good example for XSLT-based
annotation integration. Chunker analysis results
are included in the RMRS to be built through an
XSLT stylesheet using the XPath expression
document($uri)/chunkie/chunks/chunk[
®cstart=$beginspan and ®cend=$endspan]
where $uri is a variable containing an annotation
identifier of the form hog://sid/acid/aid as
explained in Section 2.1.

5 Scenario 3: Corpus Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993558">
Given the powerful online middleware archi-
tecture described above, automatic, multi-
dimensional corpus annotation can then be
regarded as a simple by-product. Heart of Gold
supports persistent storage of XML markup either
on the file system or to XML databases through
the built-in XML:DB interface. Through XSLT, it
is possible to combine multi-dimensional markup
(that would straightforwardly be stored in multiple
XML documents) into a single XML document.

Recently, linking to ontology instances and concepts has been added (Sch¨afer, 2006). 4 Scenario 2: Shallow Cascades The second scenario is described in (Frank et al., 2004) in detail. A robust, partial semantics representation is generated from a shallow chunker’s output and morphological analysis (English and German) by means of a processing cascade consisting of four SProUT grammar instances with four interleaved XSLT transformations. The cascade is defined using the declarative system description language SDL (Krieger, 2003). An SDL architecture description is compiled into a Java class which is integrated in Heart of Gold as a sub-architecture module (Fig. 5). The scenario is equally a good example for XSLT-based annotation integration. Chunker analysis results are included in the RMRS to be built through an XSLT stylesheet using the XPath expression document($uri)/chunkie/chunks/chunk[ ®cstart=$beginspan and ®cend=$endspan] where $uri is a variable containing an annotation identifier of the form hog://sid/acid/aid as explained in Section 2.1. 5 Scenario 3: Corpus Annotation Given the powerful online middleware </context>

Structured metadata like configuration and processing parameters (e.g. processing time and date, language ID etc.) are always stored within the annotation markup as first root daughter element. 2.2 XML standoff markup as first-class citizen Unlike other NLP architectures (e.g. GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002) etc.), Heart of Gold treats XML standoff annotations (Thompson and McKelvie, 1997) as first class citizens and natively supports XML (and only XML) markup of any kind. Moreover, Heart of Gold does not prescribe specific DTDs or Schemata for annotations, provided that the markup is well-formed. In this sense, it is a completely open framework that may however be constrained by requirements of the actually configured components. The advantage of this openness is easy integration of new components. Mappings need only be defined for the immediately depending annotations (see next section) which is by far not an n-to-n mapping in practical applications. However, the fact that a </context>
