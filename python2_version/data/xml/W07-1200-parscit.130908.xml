This workshop was conceived with the aim of bringing together the different computational linguistic sub-
communities which model language predominantly by way of theoretical syntax, either in the form of a
particular theory (e.g. CCG, HPSG, LFG, TAG or the Prague School) or a more general framework which
draws on theoretical and descriptive linguistics. We characterise this style of computational linguistic
research as deep linguistic processing, due to it aspiring to model the complexity of natural language in
rich linguistic representations. Aspects of this research have in the past had their own separate fora, such
as the ACL 2005 workshop on deep lexical acquisition, as well as TAG+, Alpino, ParGram and DELPH-
IN meetings. However, since the fundamental approach of building a linguistically-founded system, as
well as many of the techniques used to engineer efficient systems, are common across these projects and
independent of the specific grammar formalism chosen, we felt the need for a common meeting in which
experiences could be shared among a wider community.
Deep linguistic processing has traditionally been concerned with grammar development for parsing
and generation, with many deep processing systems using the same grammar for both directions. The
linguistic precision and complexity of the grammars meant that they had to be manually developed
and maintained, and were computationally expensive to run. With recent developments in computer
hardware, parsing and generation algorithms and statistical learning theory, the way has been opened for
deep linguistic processing to be successfully applied to an ever-growing range of languages, domains and
applications.
The same trends that have made broad-coverage deep linguistic processing feasible have occurred at the
same time as the rise of machine learning and statistical approaches to natural language processing. For
a time, these two approaches were pursued separately, often without reference to advances in the other
approach, even when the same problems were being addressed. In the past couple of years, this divide
has begun to close from both sides. As witnessed by many of the papers in this workshop, many deep
systems have statistical components to them (e.g., as pre- or post-processing to control ambiguity, as
means of acquiring and extending lexical resources) or even use machine learning techniques to acquire
deep grammars (semi-)automatically. From the other side of the divide, many of the largely statistical
approaches are using progressively richer linguistic based features and are taking advantage of these
deeper features to tackle problems traditionally reserved for deep systems, such as thematic role labelling.
The workshop has indeed brought together a range of theoretical perspectives, not just those originally
foreseen. The papers presented cover current approaches to grammar development and issues of
theoretical properties, as well as the application of deep linguistic techniques to large-scale applications
such as question answering and dialogue systems. Having industrial-scale, efficient parsers and
generators opens up new application domains for natural language processing, as well as interesting
new ways in which to approach existing applications, e.g., by combining statistical and deep processing
techniques in a triage process to process massive data quickly and accurately at a fine level of detail.
Notably, several of the papers addressed the relationship of deep linguistic processing to topical statistical
approaches, in particular in the area of parsing.
There were 45 submissions to the workshop, each of which was peer reviewed by three members of the
international programme committee; at the end of the process 10 were accepted as papers to be presented
orally and 10 as posters. We feel that such a large number of submissions for a one-day workshop reflects
an increasing interest in deep linguistic processing, an interest which is buoyed by the realization that
new, often hybrid, techniques combined with highly engineered parsers and generators and state-of-the-
art machines open the way towards practical, real-world application of this research. We look forward
to further opportunities for the different computational linguistic sub-communities who took part in this
workshop, and others, to come together in the future.
We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers, as well as the members of the programme
committee for the time and effort they contributed in reviewing the papers, in some cases at very short
notice. We should also like to thank Anette Frank for providing the perfect complement to the workshop
with her invited talk.
The workshop received sponsorship from the Large Scale Syntactic Annotation of written Dutch (Lassy)
project. The Lassy project is carried out within the STEVIN programme, which is funded by the Dutch
and Flemish governments (http://taalunieversum.org/taal/technologie/stevin/).
