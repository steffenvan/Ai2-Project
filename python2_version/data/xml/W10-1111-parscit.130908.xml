Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999460461538462">
Current metrics for de-identification are based
on information extraction metrics, and do not
address the real-world questions “how good
are current systems”, and “how good do they
need to be”. Metrics are needed that quantify
both the risk of re-identification and informa-
tion preservation. We review the challenges in
de-identifying clinical texts and the current
metrics for assessing clinical de-identification
systems. We then introduce three areas to ex-
plore that can lead to metrics that quantify re-
identification risk and information preserva-
tion.

<bodyText confidence="0.999974483870968">
Our current metrics do not address the ques-
tions “how good are current free-text de-
identification systems”, and “how good do they
need to be?” We need measures that quantify risk
of re-identification based on type and amount of
personal health identifier (PHI) leakage (PHI terms
not redacted in the de-identification process), and
measures that quantify information preservation or
readability.
The metrics in current use were developed
originally for entity extraction (the correct labeling
of types of phrases in free text, such as person
name, date, organization). Entity extraction per-
formance is typically measured in terms of preci-
sion, recall and balanced f-measure at both the
token (word) and phrase level. The top de-
identification systems (Szarvas, Farkas, &amp; Busa-
Fekete, 2007; Wellner, et al., 2007) performed well
on these measures, as reported at the first i2b2 De-
identification challenge evaluation (Uzuner, Luo,
&amp; Szolovits, 2007), achieving accuracies of over
97% token-level f-measure, with recall (sensitivity)
of over 95%. Over the past several years, these
results have been extended to more record types
and record formats; for example, (Friedlin &amp;
McDonald, 2008) reported that their MeDS system
successfully removed 99.5% of HIPAA-specified
identifiers from HL7 records. These are encourag-
ing numbers, but recall and precision do not tell us
how good a de-identification system needs to be
for a particular intended use.

2 Challenges in Clinical Text
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860238095238">
Removing PHI from unstructured text poses new
challenges: in contrast to structured information
(e.g., fields in a table or a database), we do not
know in advance where PHI will appear in a free
text record, and we do not know what kinds of PHI
will occur. This problem is made more challenging
for medical records because the types of record
vary greatly in content and in amount of PHI – for
example, a lab report will likely contain very little
PHI, while a social work note will be likely to con-
tain much more.
Medical records have internal structure that is
dependent on the medical record system and the
medical record type; there is typically a mix of
structured fields (e.g., for patient identifier, patient
name, doctor name), along with unstructured fields
for free text. This means that de-identification of
records must handle a combination of structured
and unstructured information. The excerpt below
shows two free text fields (CLINICAL HISTORY
and IMPRESSION) from a (fictitious) radiology

RADIOLOGY REPORT
CLINICAL HISTORY: Patient is a 4-
year 5-month old male who presented to
Oak Valley Health Center on 10/11/2007
with a cough of 10 days duration and fever.
Patient lives in a densely populated section
of Knoxville. Rule out pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Scattered lung densities
likely to represent either scattered atelectasis
or acute viral illness with no definite lobar
pneumonia identified.
This example illustrates how PHI is distributed
in the free text portions of a medical record. Re-
moving PHI from these free text portions requires
application of techniques from natural language
processing that are capable of identifying phrases
of specific types based on the lexical content (the
words that make up the phrases) and the surround-
ing words.

3 Current Methods and Metrics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999665304347826">
Fortunately, the problem of identifying types of
information in free text is a well-studied problem
in the natural language processing community. We
can leverage several decades of research on infor-
mation extraction and the named entity identifica-
tion problem in particular, including multiple
community evaluations such as the Message Un-
derstanding Conferences (MUC) (Grishman &amp;
Sundheim, 1996) and the subsequent Automated
Content Extraction (ACE) evaluations1 – both fo-
cused on extraction from newswire -- as well as
evaluations of biomedical entity extraction from
the published literature e.g., in the BioCreative
evaluations (Krallinger, et al., 2008). In addition,
starting in 2006, there have been a series of evalua-
tions for clinical natural language processing, with
data sets of clinical records provided by the i2b2
consortium (Uzuner, et al., 2007). It has been criti-
cally important to have corpora of medical records,
because medical records represent a very different
style of text compared to news articles or journal
articles. Medical records are characterized by their
formulaic and telegraphic style, that is, the use of

<bodyText confidence="0.999947363636363">
phrases or incomplete sentences rather than fluent
prose, along with heavy use of abbreviations and
domain-specific terminology (e.g., “93 yo w
NVD”). The systems developed for newswire or
for journal articles must be explicitly adapted (or
trained) to handle the categories required for de-
identification as well as the telegraphic language of
medical records.
De-identification of free text medical records
consists of two steps: recognition and redaction.
The phrase recognition stage corresponds to the
named entity recognition problem mentioned
above, namely the ability to identify a sequence of
words in running text that constitutes the mention
of an entity of a specified type – such as the phrase
Oak Valley Health Center in the example above.
For newswire, types of named entities include per-
son, organization, location, time, date, and money;
for biomedical tasks, entities have included genes,
proteins, drugs, diseases, etc. For de-identification,
the critical elements are the 18 types of protected
health information identified by HIPAA,2 includ-
ing names, dates, locations, zip codes, phone num-
bers, social security numbers, ages ninety and
above, URLs and other identifying information.
Interestingly, most institutions have developed
their own set of protected classes of information,
e.g., some institutions distinguish between
DOCTOR and PATIENT identifiers, which both
fall into the more general HIPAA category of
NAME.
The techniques used to recognize named enti-
ties in text include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.965376333333333">
• Lexically-based approaches that rely on
matching words (or phrases) against the
words or phrases contained in a lexicon;
• Pattern based approaches that are particu-
larly useful for HIPAA-relevant PHI such as
telephone numbers, social security numbers,
dates, etc.
• Machine learning approaches that are
based on statistical models of word se-

quences. These approaches require training
exemplars that are used to associate se-
quences of words with probabilities of types
of phrase, e.g., the word(s) following “Dr.”
or “DR” will likely be a doctor’s name.

All three approaches have been used and often
combined (Beckwith, Mahaadevan, Balis, &amp; Kuo,

Gupta, Saul, &amp; Gilbertson, 2004; Morrison, Li,

Uzuner, Sibanda, Luo, &amp; Szolovits, 2008; Wellner,
et al., 2007) to provide high quality recognition of
PHI. The 2006 i2b2 challenge evaluation for auto-
matic de-identification of free text clinical records
provided an opportunity for groups to benchmark
their automated de-identification systems against a
carefully prepared gold standard corpus of medical
discharge summaries. The top systems performed
well with scores of over 0.97 token-level f-measure
and recall (sensitivity) of over 0.95 (Uzuner, et al.,
2007).

4 Toward New Metrics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.902435">
The Uzuner et al. (2007) paper concludes with
two important (and as yet unanswered) questions
(p. 562):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.816845857142857">
1. Does success on this challenge problem ex-
trapolate to similar performance on other, untested
data sets?
2. Can health policy makers rely on this level of
performance to permit automated or semi-
automated disclosure of health data for research
purposes without undue risk to patients?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931885714285">
We have been particularly concerned with the
second question, because it will be very difficult to
release automatically de-identified data until we
can provide an answer. The metrics used to date
have been measures of technology performance,
but they do not address the key issues of risk of
PHI exposure and readability/preservation of in-
formation in the de-identified record.
Recall errors are clearly correlated with risk of
PHI exposure, but not all recall errors lead to PHI
exposure. For example, the name “Washington,
George” might be mistakenly redacted to
“LOCATION, NAME” leading to both a recall and
a precision error for the word “Washington” but no
PHI exposure. Also, some kinds of PHI exposure
errors contain much more information (e.g., a pa-
tient’s last name) than others (a first name; or a
telephone extension where the telephone number
has been redacted). Friedlin and McDonald (2008)
report that MeDS did not miss any full patient
identifiers, but it did miss an average of 2.13 pa-
tient identifier fragments per report. However, they
concluded that none of these fragments were true
patient identifiers.
Similarly, precision errors cause mislabeling of
results and are correlated with loss of readability.
In the extreme case, a system that redacts all words
would achieve perfect recall, but very low preci-
sion and no information content. A system that
replaces real PHI with synthetic (fictitious) PHI
might be more resistant to re-identification because
it would be difficult for an attacker to distinguish
real from fictitious information.
We need new measures that quantify risk of re-
identification based on type and amount of PHI
leakage (PHI terms or parts of terms not redacted
in the de-identification process); and we need
measures that quantify information preservation or
readability.
We plan to explore three areas that may yield
more useful metrics for de-identification. The first
is to quantify the re-identification risk through a
detailed analysis of PHI in different record types.
Given a set of records and a de-identification sys-
tem, we can generate quantitative data on PHI dis-
tribution in different record types, rate of exposure
of different classes of PHI (e.g., names vs. loca-
tions vs. phone numbers), and likelihood of com-
binations of exposed PHI. We can distinguish
between partial exposure of PHI (e.g., just a first
name or just a room number), and combinations of
such exposures within a single record (room num-
ber and institution provides much more identifying
information than room number alone). Using this
information, we can develop analyses of risk using
methods developed for structured data
(Machanavajjhala, Kifer, Gehrke, &amp;
Venkitasubramaniam, 2007; Malin, 2007;
Sweeney, 2002) by combining statistics from de-
identified records with publicly available informa-
tion (census data, voter registration, etc).
The second area to explore is how to measure
information preservation or readability. One ap-
proach would be to apply one or more available
medical information extraction systems such as the
Mayo Clinic cTAKES system (Savova, Kipper-
Schuler, Buntrock, &amp; Chute, 2008) to compare
information correctly extracted from de-identified
data vs. original data. This would provide a rea-
sonable proxy for measuring information loss due
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999877642857143">
to de-identification. Alternatively, Friedlin and
McDonald (2008) developed a measure of inter-
pretability in their de-identification experiments,
defined as preserving test type and test results (for
lab reports) or type of report, specimen and con-
clusion (for pathology reports).
A third area to explore is protection by hiding
in plain sight. We can determine the reduction in
risk from applying resynthesis (Yeniterzi, et al.,
2010) to de-identified data, which would have the
effect of hiding exposed PHI in plain sight – since
such elements would be interspersed with fictitious
but realistic looking identifiers (particularly
names) inserted as replacements of PHI.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947789473684">
Current metrics for de-identification have their
origins in information extraction; they neither ade-
quately assess the risk of re-identification, nor do
they provide a good measure of information pres-
ervation. We plan to address these shortcomings by
1) applying risk analysis methods derived for
structured data, 2) using medical extraction sys-
tems to assess information preservation, and 3)
exploring hiding in plain sight protection by using
resynthesis to replace identifiers with false by real-
istic fillers. Once we have alternative measures for
risk of re-identification and information preserva-
tion, we can also explore the correlation of preci-
sion and recall to these new measures. Accurately
quantifying and balancing risk of re-identification
and information preservation will enable health
policy makers to make better decisions about the
use of automated de-identification, and sharing of
clinical data for research.

The top deidentification systems (Szarvas, Farkas, &amp; BusaFekete, 2007; Wellner, et al., 2007) performed well on these measures, as reported at the first i2b2 Deidentification challenge evaluation (Uzuner, Luo, &amp; Szolovits, 2007), achieving accuracies of over 97% token-level f-measure, with recall (sensitivity) of over 95%. Over the past several years, these results have been extended to more record types and record formats; for example, (Friedlin &amp; McDonald, 2008) reported that their MeDS system successfully removed 99.5% of HIPAA-specified identifiers from HL7 records. These are encouraging numbers, but recall and precision do not tell us how good a de-identification system needs to be for a particular intended use. 2 Challenges in Clinical Text Removing PHI from unstructured text poses new challenges: in contrast to structured information (e.g., fields in a table or a database), we do not know in advance where PHI will appear in a free text record, and we do not know what kinds of PHI will occur. This problem is made more challenging for medical reco</context>

Alternatively, Friedlin and McDonald (2008) developed a measure of interpretability in their de-identification experiments, defined as preserving test type and test results (for lab reports) or type of report, specimen and conclusion (for pathology reports). A third area to explore is protection by hiding in plain sight. We can determine the reduction in risk from applying resynthesis (Yeniterzi, et al., 2010) to de-identified data, which would have the effect of hiding exposed PHI in plain sight – since such elements would be interspersed with fictitious but realistic looking identifiers (particularly names) inserted as replacements of PHI. 5 Conclusion Current metrics for de-identification have their origins in information extraction; they neither adequately assess the risk of re-identification, nor do they provide a good measure of information preservation. We plan to address these shortcomings by 1) applying risk analysis methods derived for structured data, 2) using medical extraction systems </context>
