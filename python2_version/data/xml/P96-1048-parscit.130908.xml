<bodyText confidence="0.999973222222222">
In this paper, we propose a textual clue ap-
proach to help metaphor detection, in order
to improve the semantic processing of this
figure. The previous works in the domain
studied the semantic regularities only, over-
looking an obvious set of regularities. A
corpus-based analysis shows the existence
of surface regularities related to metaphors.
These clues can be characterized by syn-
tactic structures and lexical markers. We
present an object oriented model for repre-
senting the textual clues that were found.
This representation is designed to help the
choice of a semantic processing, in terms of
possible non-literal meanings. A prototype
implementing this model is currently un-
der development, within an incremental ap-
proach allowing step-by-step evaluations.

Metaphor is a frequently used figure of speech, re-
flecting common cognitive processes. Most of the
previous works in Natural Language Understanding
(NLU) looked for regularities only on the semantic
side of this figure, as shown in a brief overview in
section 2. This resulted in complex semantic pro-
cessings, not based on any previous robust detec-
tion, or requiring large and exhaustive knowledge
bases. Our aim is to provide NLU systems with a set
of heuristics for choosing the most adequate seman-
tic processing, as well as to give some probabilistic
clues for disambiguating the possibly multiple mean-
ing representations.
A corpus-based analysis we made showed the exis-
tence of textual clues in relation with the metaphors.
These clues, mostly lexical markers combined with
syntactic structures, are easy to spot, and can pro-
vide a first set of detection heuristics. We propose, in
&apos;This work takes part in a research project sponsored
by the AUPELF-UREF (Francophone Agency For Edu-
cation and Research)
section 3, an object oriented model for representing
these clues and their properties, in order to integrate
them in a NLU system. For each class, attributes
give information for spoting the clues, and, when
possible, the source and the target of the metaphor,
using the results of a syntactic parsing. A prototype,
STK, partially implementing the model, is currently
under development, within an incremental approach.
It is already used to evaluate the clues relevance.
In conclusion, we will discuss how the model can
help chosing the adequate semantic analysis to pro-
cess at the sentence level or disambiguating multiple
meaning representations, providing probabilities for
non-literal meanings.

2 Classical methods: a brief
overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970304347826">
The classical NLU points of view of metaphor have
pointed out the multiple kinds of relations between
what is called the source and the target of the
metaphor, but rarely discuss the problem of detect-
ing the figure that bears the metaphor. For our pur-
pose, we choose to present these approaches in two
main groups, depending on how they initiate the se-
mantic processing.
The previous works led to a classification intro-
duced by Dan Foss (Fass, 1991). In the compari-
son view, the metaphor corresponds to an analogy
between the structures representing the source and
the target of the figure, as in Gentner&apos;s works (Gen-
tner, 1988) and their implementation (Falkenhainer
et al., 1989). The interaction view, as in Hobbs
(Hobbs, 1991), points at the novelty brought by the
metaphor. Fass also distinguishes a selection restric-
tions violations view presenting the metaphor as a
kind of anomaly. We would argue that the two pre-
vious views already considered metaphor as a kind
of anomaly. Indeed, the semantic analysis proposed
for dealing with metaphors were processed depend-
ing on the results of another, say a &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; one2.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.737822666666667">
2We prefer to call it a classical rather than literal
meanings processing because it can deal with some con-
ventional metaphors, even if not explicitly mentioned.

<bodyText confidence="0.999974566666667">
Thereby, detecting a metaphor meant detecting an
anomaly in the meaning representation issued from
such a classical analysis.
Fass proposed a method for discriminating literal
meanings, metaphors, metonymies and &amp;quot;anomalies&amp;quot;,
merging different points of view (Fass, 1991). In
this approach, multiple semantic analysis can be pro-
cessed, resulting in possibly multiple meaning repre-
sentations. In (Prince and Sabah, 1992), a method
to overcome similar kinds of ambiguities reveal the
difficulties encountered if no previous detection is
made. James Martin&apos;s approach (Martin, 1992),
called the conventional view by Fass, is based on
Lakoff&apos;s theory on cognitive metaphors (Lakoff and
Johnson, 1980). It requires a specific knowledge rep-
resentation base and also results in multiple repre-
sentation meanings. Detecting a metaphor is mean-
ingless here, and conventional metaphoric meanings
can be viewed as polysemies. Martin revealed at
least that the heuristic of the ill-formness of mean-
ing representations issued from classical analysis is
not sufficient at all to deal with all the possible
metaphors.
In our point of view, all the previous approaches
were founded. The main remaining problem, how-
ever, is to choose an adequate processing when con-
fronted with a metaphor, and thus, to detect the
metaphors before trying to build their meaning rep-
resentation. This can be partially solved using tex-
tual clues.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966574515151515">
If the classical views of the metaphor overlook the
textual clues, in other domains, especially those
concerning explanation, they have been wisely re-
introduced. In (Pery-Woodley, 1990), Pery-Woodley
shows the existence of such clues related to the
explanatory discourse. They can help in generat-
ing explanations in natural language as well as in
modelling the student in a intelligent tutoring sys-
tem (Daniel et al., 1992). A corpus of 26 explana-
tory texts in French, of about 200 words each, has
been collected under a shared research project be-
tween psychologists and computer scientists, in or-
der to study metaphors and analogies in teaching.
The analysis we made showed the existence of tex-
tual clues in relation with metaphoric contexts and
analogies (e.g. &amp;quot;like&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;such as&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;illustrated by&amp;quot;).
They can be characterized by syntactic regularities
(e.g. the comparative is used in structures such as
&amp;quot;less than&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;more than&amp;quot;; the identification is made
through attributes or appositions, ...). They also
involve lexical markers (e.g. &amp;quot;literaly&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;illustrat-
ing&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;metaphorically&amp;quot;,). These properties, already
found in the previous works, can help detecting the
clues themselves. Studying the relation between the
syntactic regularities and the lexical markers, one
can observe that the first build the ground where to
find the second. We thus propose an object-oriented
model for representing these clues. A generic textual
clue can thereby be described by the two following
attributes:
• the Surface Syntactic Pattern representing the
syntactic regularity, with a label on the item
where to find the lexical marker
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.923348">
• the Lexical Marker itself
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969215195652174">
Typically, the word &amp;quot;metaphor&amp;quot; itself can be used
as a lexical marker in expressions such as &apos;to ex-
tend the conventional metaphor, pruning such a
tree means to generalize&amp;quot;. On the other hand,
&amp;quot;metaphor&amp;quot; will not be a marker if used as the
subject of the sentence, like in this one. Thus,
describing the syntactic regularities surrounding a
lexical marker improves its relevance as a marker.
We propose to represent this relevance for proba-
bilistic purposes. Each clue that was found is cur-
rently evaluated on a large corpus (about 450,000
words). The frequencies of use of the lexical mark-
ers in metaphoric contexts are represented in the
relevance attribute (see example below).
The syntactic structures may also give infor-
mation about the source and the target of the
metaphor. For instance, in the sentence &amp;quot;Yesterday,
at home, Peter threw himself on the dessert like a
lion.&amp;quot;, the subject inherits the properties of speed
and voracity of a lion attacking its victim. It is here
possible to spot the source and the target of the
metaphor using the syntactic properties of the com-
parison. Two attributes are added to textual clues
related to metaphors, corresponding to the elements
of the sentence bearing the source and the target.

metaphors and adding specific marks when found.
In its current version, STK allows us to tokenize,
tag, and search for lexical markers on large corpora.
The tagger we use is the one developped by Eric
Brill (Brill, 1992) with a set of tags indicating the
grammatical categories as well as other information
such as the number and the gender for nouns and
adjectives. It is evaluated under GRACE3 protocol
for corpus-oriented tools assigning grammatical cat-
egories. It is currently used for the evaluation of
the textual clues that were found. The latter can
be easily retrieved using STK, avoiding lexical am-
biguities. They are then analyzed by hand, in order
to determine their relevance attribute. In the previ-
ous example of textual clue, the relevance values are
issued from this corpus-based analysis.

<bodyText confidence="0.999981576923077">
Classical approaches to the metaphor in NLU re-
vealed multiple underlying processes. We there-
fore focussed our study on how to help detecting
metaphors in order to chose the most adequate se-
mantic processing. Textual clues can give informa-
tion about the figures that bear the metaphor, which
are easy to spot. Indeed, they can be found using
the results of syntactic parsing. We proposed an
object-oriented model to represent these clues and
their multiple properties.
If textual clues give information about possible
non-literal meanings, metaphors and analogies, one
may argue they do not allow for a robust detection.
Indeed, a textual clue is not sufficient to prove the
presence of such figures of speech. The relevance of
each clue can be used to help disambiguating mul-
tiple meaning representation when it occurs. This
must not be the only disambiguation tool, but when
no other is avalaible, it provides NLU systems with
a probabilistic method.
Our future works will focuss on the study of the
relation between the metaphors introduced by a clue
and others that are not conventional. The guideline
is that novel metaphors not introduced by a clue at
the sentence level may have been introduced previ-
ously in the text.

The main remaining problem, however, is to choose an adequate processing when confronted with a metaphor, and thus, to detect the metaphors before trying to build their meaning representation. This can be partially solved using textual clues. 3 Textual clues: object oriented description If the classical views of the metaphor overlook the textual clues, in other domains, especially those concerning explanation, they have been wisely reintroduced. In (Pery-Woodley, 1990), Pery-Woodley shows the existence of such clues related to the explanatory discourse. They can help in generating explanations in natural language as well as in modelling the student in a intelligent tutoring system (Daniel et al., 1992). A corpus of 26 explanatory texts in French, of about 200 words each, has been collected under a shared research project between psychologists and computer scientists, in order to study metaphors and analogies in teaching. The analysis we made showed the existence of textual clues in relation with metaphoric contexts and analogies (e.g. &amp;quot;like&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;such as&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;il</context>

Fass proposed a method for discriminating literal meanings, metaphors, metonymies and &amp;quot;anomalies&amp;quot;, merging different points of view (Fass, 1991). In this approach, multiple semantic analysis can be processed, resulting in possibly multiple meaning representations. In (Prince and Sabah, 1992), a method to overcome similar kinds of ambiguities reveal the difficulties encountered if no previous detection is made. James Martin&apos;s approach (Martin, 1992), called the conventional view by Fass, is based on Lakoff&apos;s theory on cognitive metaphors (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). It requires a specific knowledge representation base and also results in multiple representation meanings. Detecting a metaphor is meaningless here, and conventional metaphoric meanings can be viewed as polysemies. Martin revealed at least that the heuristic of the ill-formness of meaning representations issued from cla</context>
