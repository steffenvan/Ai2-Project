ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999796538461538">
In this paper we describe a flexible
analysis-synthesis system which can be used for a
number of studies in speech research. The main
objective is to have a synthesis system whose
characteristics can be controlled through a set
of parameters to realize any desired voice
characteristics. The basic synthesis scheme
consists of two steps: Generation of an excita-
tion signal from pitch and gain contours and
excitation of the linear system model described
by linear prediction coefficients. We show that
a number of basic studies such as time expansion/
compression, pitch modifications and spectral
expansion/compression can be made to study the
effect of these parameters on the quality of
synthetic speech. A systematic study is made to
determine factors responsible for unnaturalness
in synthetic speech. It is found that the shape
of the glottal pulse determines the quality to a
large extent. We have also made some studies to
determine factors responsible for loss of intel-
ligibility in some segments of speech. A signal
dependent analysis-synthesis scheme is proposed
to improve the intelligibility of dynamic sounds
such as stops. A simple implementation of the

I. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894882352942">
The main objective of this paper is to
develop an analysis-synthesis system whose
parameters can be varied at will to realize any
desired voice characteristics. This will enable
us to determine factors responsible for the
unnatural quality of synthetic speech. It is
also possible to determine parameters of speech
that contribute to intelligibility. The key
ideas in our basic system are similar to the
usual linear predictive (LP) coding vocoder [11,
[2]. Our main contributions to the design of the
basic system are: (1) the flexibility incorpor-
ated in the system for changing the parameters of
excitation and system independently and (2) a
means for combining the excitation and system
through convolution without further interpolation
of the system parameters during synthesis.
Atal and Hanauer [I] demonstrated the feasi-
bility of modifying voice characteristics through
an LPC vocoder. There have been some attempts to
modify some characteristics (like pitch, speaking
rate) of speech without explicitly extracting the
source parameters. One such attempt is with the
phase vocoder [3]. A recent attempt to
independently modify the excitation and vocal
tract system characteristics is due to Senef
[4]. Unlike the LPC method, Senef&apos;s method
performs the desired transformations in the
frequency domain without explicitly extracting
pitch. However, it is difficult to adjust the
intonation patterns while modifying the voice
characteristics.
In order to transform voice from one type
(e.g., masculine) to another (e.g., feminine), it
is necessary to change not only the pitch and
vocal tract system but also the pitch contour as
well as the glottal waveshape independently. It
is known that glottal pulse shapes differ from
person to person and also for the same person for
utterances in different contexts [5]. Since one
of our objectives is to determine factors respon-
sible for producing natural sounding synthetic
speech, we have decided to implement a scheme
which controls independently the vocal tract
system characteristics and the excitation charac-
teristics such as pitch, pitch contour and
glottal waveshape. For this reason we have
decided to use the standard LPC-type vocoder.
In Sec. II we describe the basic analysis-
synthesis system developed for our studies. We
discuss two important innovations in our system
which provide smooth control of the parameters
for generating speech. In Sec. III we present
results of our studies on voice modifications and
transformations using the basic system. In
particular, we demonstrate the ease with which
one can vary independently the speaking rate,
pitch, glottal pulse shape and the vocal tract
response. We report in Sec. IV results from our
studies to determine the factors responsible for
unnatural quality of synthetic speech from our
system. After accounting for the major source of
unnaturalness in synthetic speech, we investigate
the factors responsible for low intelligibility
of some segments of speech. We propose a signal
dependent analysis-synthesis scheme in Sec. V to
improve intelligibility of dynamic sounds such as
stops.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE ANALYSIS-
SYNTHESIS SYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.785194">
A. Basic System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927066666667">
As mentioned earlier, our system is basical-
ly same as that LPC vocoders described in the
literature f2]. The production model assumes
that speech is the output of a time varying vocal
tract system excited by a time varying excita-
tion. The excitation is a quasiperiodic glottal
volume velocity signal or a random noise signal
or a combination of both. Speech analysis is
based on the assumption of quasistationarity
during short intervals (10-20 msec). At the
synthesizer the excitation parameters and gain
for each analysis frame are used to generate the
excitation signal. Then the system represented
by the vocal tract parameters is excited by this
signal to generate synthetic speech.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.699244">
B. Analysis Parameters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99342575308642">
For the basic system a fixed frame size of
20 msec (200 samples at 10kHz sampling rate) and
a frame rate of 100 frames per second are used.
For each frame a set fo 14 LPCs are extracted
using the autocorrelation method [2]. Pitch
period and voice/unvoiced decisions are deter-
mined using the SIFT algorithm [2]. The glottal
pulse information is not extracted in the basic
system. The gain for each analysis frame is
computed from the linear prediction residual.
The residual energy for an interval corresponding
to only one pitch period is computed and the
energy is divided by the period in number of
samples. This method of computation of squared
lain per sample avoids the incorrect computation
of the gain due to arbitrary location of analysis
frame relative to glottal closure.
C. Synthesis
Synthesis consists of two steps: Generation
of the excitation signal and synthesis of speech.
Separation of the synthesis procedure into these
two steps helps when modifying the voice charac-
teristics as will be evident in the following
sections. The excitation parameters are used to
generate the excitation signal as follows: The
pitch period and gain contours as a function of
analysis frame number (i) are first nonlinearly
smoothed using a 3-point median smoothing. Two
arrays (called Q and H for convenience) are cre-
ated as illustrated in Figure 1. The smoothed
pitch contour P(i) is used to generate a 0-array
using the value of the pitch period at any point
to determine the next point on the pitch contour.
Since the pitch period is given in number of
samples and the interframe interval is known, say
N samples, the value of the pitch period at the
end of the current pitch period is determined
using suitable interpolation of P(i) for points
in between two frame indicies. The values of the
pitch period as read from the pitch contour are
stored in the 0-array. The entry in the 0-array
is the value of the pitch period for that
frame. For nonvoiced frames the number of
samples to be skipped along the horizontal axis
is N, although on the pitch contour the value is
zero. The entry in the 0-array for unvoiced
frames is zero. For each entry in the 0-array
the corresponding squared gain per sample can be
computed from the gain contour using suitable
interpolation between two frame indices. The
squared gain per sample corresponding to each
element in the 0-array is stored in the H-array.
From the 0 and H arrays an excitation signal
is generated as follows. For each nonvoiced
segment, identified by an entry zero in the Q-
array, Ns samples of random noise are generated.
The average energy per sample of the noise is
adjusted to be equal to the entry in the H-array
corresponding to that segment. For a voiced
segment identified by a nonzero value in the Q-
array, the required number of excitation samples
are generated using any desired excitation model.
In the initial experiments only one of the five
exctiation models shown in Figure 2 were
considered. The model parameters were fixed
apriori and they were not derived from the
speech signal. Note that the total number of
excitation samples generated in this way are
equal to the number of desired synthetic speech
samples.
Once the excitation signal is obtained, the
synthetic speech is generated by exciting the
vocal tract system with the excitation samples.
The system parameters are updated every N
samples. We are not using pitch synchronous
updating of the parameters, as is normally done
in LPC synthesis. Therefore, interpolation of
parameters is not necessary. Thus, the
instability problems arising out of the
interpolated system parameters are avoiced. We
still obtain a very smooth synthetic speech.

The excitation signal was generated using the
smoothed pitch and gain contours with the non-

excitation model-3 (Fig. 2) was used throughout
the initial studies. This model was a simple
Impulse excitation normally used in most LPC syn-
thesizers. Synthesis was performed by using the
excitation signal with the all-pole system.
The system parameters were updated every 100

We conducted the following studies using

IV. FACTORS FOR UNNATURAL QUALITY
OF SYNTHETIC SPEECH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990427642857143">
It appears that the quality of the overall
speech depends on the quality of reproduction of
voiced segments. To determine the factors
responsible for synthetic quality of speech, a
systematic investigation was performed. The
first part of the investigation consisted of
determining which of the three factors namely,
the vocal tract response, pitch period contour,
and glottal pulse shape contributed significantly
to the unnatural quality. Each of these factors
was varied over a wide range of alternatives to
determine whether a significant improvement in
quality can be achieved. We have found that
glottal pulse approximation contributes to the
voice quality more than the vocal tract system
model and pitch period errors.
Different excitation models were investi-
gated to determine the one which contributes most
significantly to naturalness. If we replace the
glottal pulse characteristics with the LP
residual itself, we get the original speech. If
we can model the excitation suitably and
determine the parameters of the model from
speech, then we can generate high quality
synthetic speech. But it is not clear how to
model the excitation. Several artificial pulse
shapes with their parameters arbitrarily fixed,
are used in our studies (Fig. 2).

<bodyText confidence="0.979512529411765">
Out of all these, Model-5 seems to produce
the best quality speech. However, the most
important problem to be addressed is how to
determine the model parameters from speech.
The studies on excitation models indicate
that the shape of the excitation pulse is
critical and it should be close to the original
pulse if naturalness is to be obtained in the
synthetic speech. Another way of viewing this is
that the phase function of the excitation plays a
prominent role in determining the quality. None
of the simplified models approximate the phase
properly. So it is necessary to model the phase
of the original signal and incorporate it in the
synthesis. Flanagan&apos;s phase vocoder studies [7]
also suggest the need for incorporating phase of
the signal in synthesis.

V. SIGNAL-DEPENDENT ANALYSIS-
SYNTHESIS SCHEME
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992709375">
The quality of synthetic speech depends
mostly on the reproduction of voiced speech,
whereas, we conjecture that intelligibility of
speech depends on how different segments are
reproduced. It is known [8] that analysis frame
size, frame rate, number of LPCs, pre-emphasis
factor, glottal pulse shape, should be different
for different classes of segments in an
utterance. In many cases unnecessary preemphasis
of data, or high order LPCs can produce
undesirable effects. Human listeners perform the
analysis dynamically depending on the nature of
the input segment. So it is necessary to
incorproate a signal dependent analysis-synthesis
feature into the system.
There are several ways of implementing the
signal dependent analysis ideas. One way is to
have a fixed size window whose shape changes
depending on the desired effective size of the
frame. We use the signal knowledge embodied in
the pitch contour to guide the analysis. For
example, the shape of the window could be a
Gaussian function, whose width can be controlled
by the pitch contour. The frame rate is kept as
high as possible during the analysis stage.
Unnecessary frames can be discarded, thus
reducing the storage requirement and synthesis
effort.
The signal dependent analysis can be taken
to any level of sophistication, with consequent
advantages of improvement in intelligibility,
bandwidth compression and probably quality also.

VI. DISCUSSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951666666667">
We have presented in this paper a discussion
of an analysis-synthesis system which is
convenient to study various aspects of the speech
signal such as the importance of different
parameters of features and their effect on
naturalness and intelligibility. Once the
characteristics of the speech signal are well
understood, it is possible to transform the voice
characteristics of an utterance in any desired
manner. It is to be noted that modelling both
the excitation signal and the vocal tract system
are crucial for any studies on speech.
Significant success has been achieved in
modelling the vocal tract system accurately for
purposes of synthesis. But on the other hand we
have not yet found a convenient way of modelling
the excitation source. It is to be noted that
the solution to the source modelling problem does
not lie in preserving the entire LP residual or
its Fourier transform or parts of the residual
information in either domain. Because any such
