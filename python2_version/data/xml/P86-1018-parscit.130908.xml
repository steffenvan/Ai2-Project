Natural language processing systems
need large lexicons containing explicit
information about lexical-semantic
relationships, selection restrictions,
and verb categories. Because the labor
involved in constructing such lexicons by
hand is overwhelming, we have been trying
to construct lexical entries
automatically from information available
in the machine-readable version of
Webster&apos;s Seventh Collegiate Dictionary.
This work is rich in implicit
information; the problem is to make it
explicit. This paper describes methods
for finding taxonomy and set-membership
relationships, recognizing nouns that
ordinarily represent human beings, and
identifying active and stative verbs and
adjectives.
INTRODUCTION
Large natural language processing
systems need lexicons much larger than
those available today with explicit
information about lexical-semantic
relationships, about usage, about forms,
abOut morphology, about case frames and
selection restrictions and other kinds of
collocational information. Apresyan,
Mel&apos;cuk, and Zholkovsky studied the kind
of explicit lexical information needed by
non-native speakers of a language. Their
Explanatory-Combinatory Dictionary (1970)
explains how each word is used and how it
combines with others in phrases and
sentences. Their dream has now been
realized in a full-scale dictionary of
Russian (Mel&apos;cuk and Zholkovsky, 1985)
and in example entries for French
(Mel&apos;cuk et al., 1984). Computer
programs need still more explicit and
detailed information. We have discussed
elsewhere the kind of lexical information
needed in a question answering system
(Evens and Smith, 1978) and by a system
to generate medical case reports (Li et
al., 1985).

A number of experiments have shown
that relational thesauri can
significantly improve the effectiveness
of an information retrieval system (Fox,
1980; Evens et al., 1985; Wang et al.,
1985). A relational thesaurus is used to
add further terms to the query, terms
I
that are related to the griginal by
lexical relations like sYnonymy,
taxonomy, set-membership, or the part-
whole relation, among others. The
addition of these related terms enables
the system to identify more relevant
documents. The development of such
relational thesauri would be
comparatively simple if we had a large
lexicon containing relational
information. (A comparative study of
lexical relations can be found in Evens
et al., 1980).
The work involved in developing a
lexicon for a large subset of English is
so overwhelming, that it seems
appropriate to try to build a lexicon
automatically by analyzing information in
a machine-readable dictionary. A
collegiate level dictionary contains an
enormous amount of information about
thousands of words in the natural
language it describes. This information
is presented in a form intended to be
easily understood and used by a human
being with at least some command of the
language. Unfortunately, even when the
dictionary has been transcribed into
machine-readable form, the knowledge
which a human user can acquire from the
dictionary is not readily available to
the computer.
There have been a number of efforts to
extract information from machine-
readable dictionaries. Amsler (1980,
1981, 1982) and Amsler and John White
(1979) mapped out the taxonomic
hierarchies of nouns and verbs in the
Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary.
Michiels (1981, 1983) analyzed the
Longman Dictionary of Contemporary
English (LDOCE), taking advantage of the
fact that that dictionary was designed to
some extent to facilitate computer
manipulation. Smith (1981) studied the

&amp;quot;defining formulae&amp;quot; - significant
recurring phrases - in a selection of
adjective definitions from Webster&apos;s
Seventh Collegiate Dictionary (W7).
Carolyn White (1983) has developed a
program to create entries for Sager&apos;s
Linguistic String Parser (1981) from W7.
Chodorow and Byrd (1985) have extracted
taxonomic hierarchies, associated with
feature information, from LDOCE and W7.
We have parsed W7 adjective
definitions (Ahlswede, 1985b) using
Sager&apos;s Linguistic String Parser (Sager,
1981) in order to automatically identify
lexical-semantic relations associated
with defining formulae. We have also
(Ahlswede and Evens, 1983) identified
defining formulae in noun, verb and
adverb definitions from W7. At present
we are working on three interrelated
projects: identiication and analysis of
lexical-semantic .elations in or out of
W7; generation of computed definitions
for words which are used or referred to
but not defined in W7; and parsing of the
entire dictionary (or as much of it as
possible) to generate from it a large
general lexical knowledge base.
This paper represents a continuation
of our work on defining formulae in
dictionary definitions, in particular
definitions from W7. The patterns we
deal with are limited to recurring
phrases, such as &apos;&amp;quot;any of a&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a quality
or state of&amp;quot; (common in noun definitions)
and &amp;quot;of or relating to&amp;quot; (common in
adjective definitions). From such
phrases, we gain information not only
about the words being defined but also
about the words used in the definitions
and other words in the lexicon.
Specifically, we can extract selectional
information, co-occurrence relations, and
lexical-semantic relations. These
methods of extracting information from W7
were designed for use in the lexicon
builder described earlier by Ahlswede
(1985a).
The computational steps involved in
this study were relatively simple. First
W7 definitions were divided by part of
speech into separate files for nouns,
verbs, adjectives, and others. Then a
separate Keyword In Context (KWIC) Index
was made for each part of speech.
Hypotheses were tried out initially on a
subset of the dictionary containing only
those words which appeared eight or more
times in the Kucera and Francis corpus
(1968) of a million words of running
English text. Those that proved valid
for this subset were then tested on the
full dictionary. This work would have
been impossible without the kind
permission of the G. &amp; C. Merriam
Company to use the machine-readable
version of W7 (Olney et,al. 1967).
NOUN TAXONOMY
Noun definitions which begin with
&amp;quot;Any&amp;quot; signal a taxonomic relationship
between the noun being defined and a
taxonomic superordinate which follows the
word &amp;quot;Any.&amp;quot; One subset of the formulae
beginning with &amp;quot;Any&amp;quot; has the form: &amp;quot;Any&amp;quot;-
NP, where the NP can be a noun, noun
phrase, or a co-ordinated noun or
adjective structure.
la. alkyl any univalent aliphatic,
aromatic-aliphatic, or
alicyclic hydrocarbon radical.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.932874">
b. ammunition any material used in
attack or defense.
c. streptococcus any coccus in chains
d. nectar any delicious drink
e. discord any harsh or unpleasant
sound
f. milkwort any herb of a genus
(Polygala) of the family
Polygalaceae, the milkwort
family
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996171964285714">
In these definitions the taxonomic
superordinate of the noun being defined
is the head noun of the NP immediately
following &amp;quot;Any&amp;quot;. The superordinate of
&amp;quot;alkyl&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;radical,&amp;quot; which is the head
of the co-ordinated structure following
&amp;quot;Any&amp;quot; whereas the superordinate of
&amp;quot;ammunition&amp;quot; is the unmodified noun
&amp;quot;material.&amp;quot; Of the 97 examples of &amp;quot;Any&amp;quot;-
NP only two failed to contain an overt
taxonomic superordinate following &amp;quot;Any.&amp;quot;
2a. week any seven consecutive days
b. couple any two persons paired
together
In each of these cases there is an
implicit taxonomic superordinate &amp;quot;set.&amp;quot;
The second frequently occurring subset
of noun definitions containing &amp;quot;Any&amp;quot;
begins with the following pattern: &amp;quot;Any
of&amp;quot;-NP. This pattern has two principal
realizations depending upon what
immediately follows &amp;quot;Any of.&amp;quot; In one
sub-pattern a quantifier, numeric
expression, or &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; follows the initial
&amp;quot;Any of&amp;quot; and begins an NP which contains
the superordinate of the noun being
defined. This pattern is similar to that
described above for the &amp;quot;Any&amp;quot;-NP formula.

colored artificial flies
b. allomorph any of two or more distinct
crystalline forms of the same
substance.
c. elder any of various church
officers
</listItem>
<figure confidence="0.8189684">
The other sub-pattern expresses a
biological taxonomic relationship and has
the following definition structure:
&amp;quot;Any of a/an&amp;quot;
&lt;optional&gt; modifier
taxonomic level
&amp;quot;(&amp;quot;scientific name&amp;quot;)&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;of&amp;quot; taxonomic superordinate
either attributes or taxonomic
subordinate
</figure>
<figureCaption confidence="0.718548315789474">
The modifier is optional and modifies
the taxonomic level of the noun being
defined; the capitalized scientific name
of the level follows in parenthesis; the
taxonomic superordinate can be a noun or
a complex NP and is the object of the
second &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; in the formula; and the
information following the superordinate
is generally a co-ordinated structure,
frequently co-ordinated NPs. Of the 901
instances of the definition-initial &amp;quot;Any
of a/an&amp;quot; sequence 853, or 95 per cent,
were biological definitions.
4a. ant any of a family (Formicidae)

organization and various

spikelets of bracts.

c. acarid any of an order (Acarina) of

f. archaeornis any of a genus
(Archaeornis) of upper
Jurassic toothed birds.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.932487818181818">
The only sequences which break from
the pattern described above are non-
biological definitions, which do not have
parenthetical information following the
head noun of the NP following &amp;quot;Any of
a/an&amp;quot; and biological definitions where
that head noun is &amp;quot;breed.&amp;quot;
5a. globulin any of a class of simple
proteins (as myosin) insoluble
in pure water but soluble in
dilute salt solutions that
occur widely in plant and
animal tissues.
b. rottweiler any of a breed of tall
vigorous black short-haired
cattle dogs.
c. poland china any of an American
breed of large white-marked
black swine of the lard type.
The definition for &amp;quot;globulin&amp;quot;
illustrates that even when a non-
biological definition has a parenthesis,
that parenthetical information does not
immediately follow the NP following &amp;quot;Any
of a/an.&amp;quot; The other definitions in (5)
are instances of &amp;quot;breed&amp;quot; following &amp;quot;Any
of a/an.&amp;quot; In general, when a definition
begins with &amp;quot;Any of a/an&amp;quot; it is almost
certainly a biological definition and
that certainty is increased if the &amp;quot;Any
of a/an noun&amp;quot; is immediately followed by
parenthesis unless the noun of the
pattern is &amp;quot;breed.&amp;quot;

THE MEMBER-SET RELATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965201181818182">
Another defining formula with an
interesting resemblance to taxonomy also
occurs in noun definitions. The pattern
&amp;quot;A member of&amp;quot;-NP is similar to the basic
organization of the &amp;quot;Any&amp;quot; definitions in
that the immediate superordinate of the
noun being defined is the object of the
preposition &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; except in this pattern
the relationship is, of course, member-
set.
6a. hand a member of a ship&apos;s crew.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962208363636364">
b. earl a member of the third grade
of the British peerage ranking
below a marquess and above a
viscount.
c. Frank a member of a West Germanic
people entering the Roman
provinces in A.D. 253,
occupying the Netherlands and
most of Gaul, and establishing
themselves along the Rhine.
d. republican a member of a political

party advocating republicanism
e. Fox a member of an Indian people
formerly living in Wisconsin.
f. Episcopalian a member of an episcopal
church (as the Protestant
Episcopal Church).
g. friar a member of a mendicant order
What we have here is a generic term
for any member of the specified set. It
is perhaps best thought of as similar to
the part-whole relation -- a hand is part
of a crew, a Frank is part of a tribe, an
earl is (somewhat inelegantly) part of a
peerage.
In our data the nouns being defined
with this formula are invariably human.
Of the 581 definitions which begin with
&amp;quot;A member of&amp;quot; only nine define non-human
nouns and two of those are
anthropomorphic.
7a. Jotunn a member of a race of giants
in Norse mythology
b. Houyhnhnm a member of a race of
horses endowed with reason in
Swift&apos;s Gulliver&apos;s Travels.
Why is it important to mark nouns in a
lexicon as explicitly human? Many verbs
can take only human subjects or objects.
Also, the choice between the relative
pronouns who and which depends on whether
the referent is human or not.
The member-set relation needs to be
distinguished from another relation that
classifies a specific individual as in
8a. Circe sorceress who changed
Odysseus&apos; men into swine.

GENERIC AGENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98759896969697">
Generic agents are the typical fillers
of the agent argument sot for a given
verb. They are particularly valuable in
understanding intersentential references
or generating them. One very surprising
source of definitions for human nouns is
the formula &amp;quot;One that.&amp;quot; Of the 1419
examples of this pattern 694, or 49 per
cent were verifiably human. That is, it
was possible to determine from the
definition itself or from associated
definitions, such as a related verb, that
the noun being defined was +human. This
estimate is, therefore, conservative. It
was also determined that a large portion
of these definitions (30 per cent) were
of occupations.

gold leaf
b. pollster one that conducts a poll or

WHAT THE PARENTHESES TELL US

<bodyText confidence="0.999676052631579">
The formula &amp;quot;one (..)&amp;quot; offers very
different information. (This formula
typically occurs somewhere in the middle
of a definition, not at the beginning.)
If the first word of the parenthetical
information is not &amp;quot;as&amp;quot;, a definition
which begins with this pattern is a
biological definition. The parenthetical
material is the scientific name of the
noun being defined. These definitions
are sub-definitions and almost invariably
follow &amp;quot;esp: &amp;quot;.
10a. pimpernel any of a genus (Anagallis)

SUFFIX DEFINITIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984787108695652">
The defining pattern &amp;quot;One...(...
specific /such...)&amp;quot; is an interesting
sequence which is only used to define
suffixes. The words &amp;quot;specific&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;such&amp;quot; signal this while at the same time
indicating what semantic information
should be taken from the stem to which
the suffix is affixed.
11a. -er one that is a suitable object
of (a specified action).
b. -ate one acted upon (in a specified
way).
c. -morph one having (such) a form.
d. -path one suffering from (such) an
ailment.
e. -ant one that performs (a specified
action).
f. -grapher one that writes about
(specified) material or in a
(specified) way.
Examples associated with some of the
definitions in (10) are &amp;quot;isomorph,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;psychopath,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;violinist.&amp;quot; We are in
the process of analyzing all instances of
parenthetical &amp;quot;specified&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;such&amp;quot; to
determine whether the defining formula
exemplified by (10) is a general approach
to the definition of affixes. Clearly,
the use of parentheses is very
significant, signalling an important
semantic distinction.
WHAT NOUN DEFINITIONS TELL US ABOUT VERBS
Noun defining patterns can provide
important information about specific
verbs. Not surprisingly, one of these is
the pattern &amp;quot;Act of Ving&amp;quot; which is an
indicator of action verbs.
Action verbs differ from stative verbs
in a number of important ways. Action
verbs like bite and persuade can appear
in imperative sentences, while stative
verbs like own and resemble cannot:
Bite that man!
Persuade him to go!
*Own the house!
*Resemble your father!
Action verbs take the progressive aspect;
stative verbs do not:
She is biting the man.
She is persuading him to go.
*She is owning the house.
*She is resembling your father.
Action verbs can appear in a number of
embedded sentences where statives cannot
be used.
I told her to bite the man.
*I told her to own the house.
In definitions the action verb appears
as the gerundive object of the
preposition &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; or as the present-tense
verb of the subordinate clause.
12a. plumbing the act of using a plumb.
b. forgiveness the act of forgiving.
c. soliloquy the act of talking to
oneself.
d. projection the act of throwing or
shooting forward.
e. refund the act of refunding
f. protrusion the act of protruding.
g. investiture the act of ratifying
or establishing in office.
The examples in (11) indicate that the
related verb is not always
morphologically related. This pattern
could, therefore, be used as a means of
accessing semantically related verbs and
nouns or as a tool for the construction
of a semantic network.
&amp;quot;The act of Ving&amp;quot; definitions have a
subpattern which consists of &amp;quot;The act of
Ving or the state of being &lt;adj&gt;.&amp;quot; There
are not many examples of this subpattern,
but in all but one instance the noun
being defined, the verb and the adjective
are morphologically related.
13a. adornment the act of adorning or the
state of being adorned.
b. popularization the act of
popularizing or the state of
being popularized
c. nourishment the act of nourishing or
the state of being nourished.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997608">

<bodyText confidence="0.964884839285715">
d. intrusion the act of intruding or the
state of being intruded.
e. embodiment the act of embodying or
the state of being embodied.
In contrast, our data do not support
the use of the corresponding formula &amp;quot;The
state of being&amp;quot;-past part, for
identifying stative verbs. Many
instances of this pattern appear to be
passives or stative use of normally non-
stative verbs. This position is
supported by the presence of a fair
number of definitions which conjoin the
two formulae.
14a. displacement the act or process
of displacing: the state of
being displaced.
b. examination the act or process of
examining: the state of being
examined.
c. expansion the act or process of
expanding. The quality or
state of being expanded.
It is likely that the formula &amp;quot;The
quality or state of being&amp;quot;-past part. is
a stative verb indicator when it does not
co-occur with &amp;quot;Act of&amp;quot; definitions.
Support comes from the frequency with
which that pattern alternates adjectives,
which are normally stative, with the past
participle.
SELECTIONAL INFORMATION
FOR VERB DEFINITIONS
Although the structure of verb
definitions is much more limited than
that of noun definitions, elements of
verb definitions do provide interesting
insights into collocational information.
One striking example of this is the use
of parenthetical information which flags
typical instantiations of case arguments
for the verb being defined. The most
consistent of these patterns is &amp;quot;To&amp;quot;-V-
Was&amp;quot;,NP) where the NP is the typical
object of the verb being defined.
15a. mount to put or have (as artillery)
in position.
b. lay to bring forth and deposit (an
egg).
c. develop to subject (exposed
photographic material) to a
usu. chemical treatment...
We are in the process of determining
how consistent the parenthetical &amp;quot;as&amp;quot; is
in signalling typical case relations.
SELECTIONAL INFORMATION FOR ADJECTIVES
Adjective definitions differ from
those of nouns and verbs in that while
nouns are virtually always defined in
terms of other nouns and verbs in terms
of other verbs, only about 10 percent of
adjectives are defined in terms of other
adjectives -- the rest are related to
nouns or sometimes to verbs.
Furthermore, the semantic information in
an adjective definition refers more to
the noun (or type of noun) modified by
the adjective than it does to the
adjective itself. This is because an
adjective, together with the noun it
modifies, defines a taxonomic
relationship -- or, to put it another
way, denotes a feature of the thing
defined in the adjective+noun phrase.
For instance, we can say either that the
phrase &amp;quot;big dog&amp;quot; denotes a particular
kind of (the more general term) &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot;; or
that it denotes a dog with the additional
feature of &amp;quot;bigness&amp;quot;.
A useful piece of information we would
like to get from adjective definitions is
selectional information -- what sort of
noun the adjective can meaningfully
modify. Selectional restrictions are
harder to find and are largely negative -
- for instance, the formula &amp;quot;containing&amp;quot;
defines adjectives that do not (in the
sense so defined) modify animate nouns.
10a. basic containing relatively little
silica.
b. normal containing neither basic
hydroxyl nor acid hydrogen.
The same is true of some other
moderately common formulae, such as
&amp;quot;consisting of&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;extending&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;causing&amp;quot;. We hope that further analysis
will allow us to find more indications of
selectional characteristics of
adjectives.
RECOGNIZING ACTION VS. STATIVE ADJECTIVES
One property belonging more to
adjectives themselves than to their
associated nouns is an active-stative
distinction similar to that found in
verbs. The test for an &amp;quot;active&amp;quot;
adjective is that one may use it in a
statement of the form &amp;quot;they are being ---
-&amp;quot; or in the command &amp;quot;be ----!&amp;quot; e.g. &amp;quot;be
aggressive!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;be good!&amp;quot;, but not *&amp;quot;be
tall!&amp;quot; or *&amp;quot;be ballistic!&amp;quot; As these
examples indicate, most adjectives that
can be used actively can also be used
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992757">
117
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997404936170213">
statively -- aggressiveness or goodness
may be thought of as a state rather than
as an action -- but not the other way
around.
Contrary to our expectations, the
active-stative parameter of adjectives is
much easier to identify in definitions
than is selectional information. Some of
the defining formulae discussed in Smith
(1981) and Ahlswede (1985b) seem to be
limited to stative adjectives. &amp;quot;Of or
relating to&amp;quot;, one of the most ccmmon, is
one of these:
lla, ballistic of or relating to
ballistics or to a body in
motion according to the laws
of ballistics.
b. literary of or relating to books.
Although many adjectives defined with
&amp;quot;of or relating to&amp;quot; can be used actively
in other senses, they are strictly
stative in the senses where this formula
is used:
12a. civil of or relating to citizens
&lt;&amp;quot; liberties&gt;.
b. peaceful of or relating to a state
or time of peace.
The common formula &amp;quot;being ...&amp;quot;, on the
other hand, defines adjectives which at
least lean toward the action end of the
spectrum:
13a. natural being in accordance with
or determined by nature.
b. cursed being under or deserving a
curse.
Even such a normally stative adjective as
&amp;quot;liquid&amp;quot; is relatively active in one of
its senses:
14a. liquid being musical and free of
harshness in sound.
By no means all formulae give
indications of the stative-active
qualities of an adjective. A large
family of formulae (&amp;quot;having&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;characterized by, &amp;quot;marked by&amp;quot;, etc.)
denoting attribution, are completely
neutral with respect to this parameter.

SUMMARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997039">
W7 contains a wealth of implicit
information. We have presented methods
for making some of this information
explicit by focussing on specific
formulae found in noun, verb, and
adjective definitions. Most of these
formulae appear at the start of
definitions, but we have also
demonstrated that important information
can be extracted from syntactic and
graphemic elements, such as
parentheticals. The information we have
extracted involves lexical relationships
such as taxonomy and set membership,
selectional restrictions, and special
subcategories of nouns, verbs, and
adjectives. This information is used by
an automatic lexicon builder to create
lexical entries automatically from W7
definitions.

<abstract confidence="0.99602605">Natural language processing systems need large lexicons containing explicit information about lexical-semantic relationships, selection restrictions, and verb categories. Because the labor involved in constructing such lexicons by is overwhelming, we have to construct lexical entries automatically from information available in the machine-readable version of Webster&apos;s Seventh Collegiate Dictionary. This work is rich in implicit information; the problem is to make it explicit. This paper describes methods for finding taxonomy and set-membership relationships, recognizing nouns that ordinarily represent human beings, and identifying active and stative verbs and adjectives.</abstract>

Smith (1981) studied the 112 &amp;quot;defining formulae&amp;quot; - significant recurring phrases - in a selection of adjective definitions from Webster&apos;s Seventh Collegiate Dictionary (W7). Carolyn White (1983) has developed a program to create entries for Sager&apos;s Linguistic String Parser (1981) from W7.

We have also (Ahlswede and Evens, 1983) identified defining formulae in noun, verb and adverb definitions from W7. At present we are working on three interrelated projects: identiication and analysis of lexical-semantic .elations in or out of W7; generation of computed definitions for words which are used or referred to but not defined in W7; and parsing of the entire dictionary (or as much of it as possible) to generate from it a large genera</context>

From such phrases, we gain information not only about the words being defined but also about the words used in the definitions and other words in the lexicon. Specifically, we can extract selectional information, co-occurrence relations, and lexical-semantic relations. These methods of extracting information from W7 were designed for use in the lexicon builder described earlier by Ahlswede (1985a). The computational steps involved in this study were relatively simple. First W7 definitions were divided by part of speech into separate files for nouns, verbs, adjectives, and others. Then a separate Keyword In Context (KWIC) Index was made for each part of speech. Hypotheses were tried out initially on a subset of the dictionary containing only those words which appeared eight or more times in the Kucera and Francis corpus (1968) of a million words of running English text.

Their Explanatory-Combinatory Dictionary (1970) explains how each word is used and how it combines with others in phrases and sentences. Their dream has now been realized in a full-scale dictionary of Russian (Mel&apos;cuk and Zholkovsky, 1985) and in example entries for French (Mel&apos;cuk et al., 1984). Computer programs need still more explicit and detailed information. We have discussed elsewhere the kind of lexical information needed in a question answering system (Evens and Smith, 1978) and by a system to generate medical case reports (Li et al., 1985). This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under IST-85- 10069. A number of experiments have shown that relational thesauri can significantly improve the effectiveness of an information retrieval system (Fox, 1980; Evens et al., 1985; Wang et al., 1985).

(A comparative study of lexical relations can be found in Evens et al., 1980). The work involved in developing a lexicon for a large subset of English is so overwhelming, that it seems appropriate to try to build a lexicon automatically by analyzing information in a machine-readable dictionary. A collegiate level dictionary contains an enormous amount of information about thousands of words in the natural language it describes. This information is presented in a form intended to be easily understood and used by a human being with at least some command of the language.

Contrary to our expectations, the active-stative parameter of adjectives is much easier to identify in definitions than is selectional information. Some of the defining formulae discussed in Smith (1981) and Ahlswede (1985b) seem to be limited to stative adjectives. &amp;quot;Of or relating to&amp;quot;, one of the most ccmmon, is one of these: lla, ballistic of or relating to ballistics or to a body in motion according to the laws of ballistics. b. literary of or relating to books. Although many adjectives defined with &amp;quot;of or relating to&amp;quot; can be used actively in other senses, they are strictly stative in the senses where this formula is used: 12a. civil of or relating to citizens &lt;&amp;quot; liberties&gt;. b. peaceful of or relating to a state or time of peace.
