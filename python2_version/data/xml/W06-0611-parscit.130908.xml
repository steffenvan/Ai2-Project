Abstract

As the interest in annotated corpora is
spreading, there is increasing concern with
using existing language technology for
corpus processing. In this paper we ex-
plore the idea of using natural language
generation systems for corpus annotation.
Resources for generation systems often fo-
cus on areas of linguistic variability that
are under-represented in analysis-directed
approaches. Therefore, making use of
generation resources promises some sig-
nificant extensions in the kinds of anno-
tation information that can be captured.
We focus here on exploring the use of
the KPML (Komet-Penman MultiLingual)
generation system for corpus annotation.
We describe the kinds of linguistic infor-
mation covered in KPML and show the
steps involved in creating a standard XML
corpus representation from KPML’s gener-
ation output.

Many high-quality, theory-rich language process-
ing systems can potentially be applied to corpus
processing. However, the application of exist-
ing language technology, such as lexical and/or
grammatical resources as well as parsers, turns out
not to be as straightforward as one might think
it should be. Using existing computational lexi-
cons or thesauri, for instance, can be of limited
value because they do not contain the domain-
specific vocabulary that is needed for a partic-
ular corpus. Similarly, most existing grammat-
ical resources for parsing have restricted cover-
age in precisely those areas of variation that are
now most in need of corpus-supported investiga-
tion (e.g., predicate-argument structure, informa-
tion structure, rhetorical structure). Apart from
limited coverage, further issues that may impede

the ready application of parsers in corpus process-
ing include:
• Annotation relevance. Specialized, theory-
specific parsers (also called ‘deep parsers’;
e.g., LFG or HPSG parsers) have been built
with theoretical concerns in mind rather than
appliability to unrestricted text. They may
thus produce information that is not annota-
tionally relevant (e.g., many logically equiv-
alent readings of a single clause).
• Usability. Deep parsers are highly complex
tools that require expert knowledge. The ef-
fort in acquiring this expert knowledge may
be too high relative to the corpus processing
task.
• Completeness. Simple parsers (commonly
called ‘shallow parsers’), on the other
hand, produce only one type of anno-
tationally relevant information (e.g., PoS,
phrase/dependency structure). Other desir-
able kinds of information are thus lack-
ing (e.g., syntactic functions, semantic roles,
theme-rheme).
• Output representation. Typically, a parsing
output is represented in a theory-specific way
(e.g., in the case of LFG or HPSG parsers,
a feature structure). Such output does not
conform to the common practices in corpus
representation.1 Thus, it has to be mapped
onto one of the standardly used data mod-
els for corpora (e.g., annotation graphs (Bird
and Liberman, 2001) or multi-layer hier-
archies (Sperberg-McQueen and Huitfeldt,
2001; Teich et al., 2001)) and transformed
to a commonly employed format, typically
XML.

In spite of these difficulties, there is a general
consensus that the reward for exploring deep pro-
cessing techniques to build up small to medium-
scale corpus resources lies in going beyond the
kinds of linguistic information typically covered
by treebanks (cf. (Baldwin et al., 2004; Cahill et
al., 2002; Frank et al., 2003)).
In this paper, we would like to contribute to this
enterprise by adding a novel, yet complementary
perspective on theory-rich, high-quality corpus an-
notation. In a reappraisal of the potential contribu-
tion of natural language generation technology for
providing richly annotated corpora, we explore the
idea of annotation by generation. Although this
may at first glance seem counter-intuitive, in fact a
generator, similar to a parser, creates rather com-
plex linguistic descriptions (which are ultimately
realized as strings). In our current investigations,
we are exploring the use of these complex linguis-
tic descriptions for creating annotations. We be-
lieve that this may offer a worthwhile alternative
or extension of corpus annotation methods which
may alleviate some of the problems encountered
in parsing-based approaches.
The generation system we are using is the KPML
(Komet-Penman MultiLingual; (Bateman, 1997))
system. One potential advantage of KPML over
other generation systems and over many parsing
systems is its multi-stratal design. The kinds
of linguistic information included in KPML range
from formal-syntactic (PoS, phrase structure) to
functional-syntactic (syntactic functions), seman-
tic (semantic roles/frames) and discoursal (e.g.,
theme-rheme, given-new). Also, since KPML has
been applied to generate texts from a broad spec-
trum of domains, its lexicogrammatical resources
cover a wide variety of registers—another poten-
tial advantage in the analysis of unrestricted text.
As well as our general concern with investigat-
ing the possible benefits of applying generation
resources to the corpus annotation task, we are
also more specifically concerned with a series of
experiments involving the KPML system as such.
Here, for example, we are working towards the
construction of “treebanks” based on the theory of
Systemic-Functional Linguistics (SFL; (Halliday,
2004)), so as to be able to empirically test some of
SFL’s hypotheses concerning patterns of instantia-
tion of the linguistic system in authentic texts. An-
notating the variety of linguistic categories given
in SFL manually is very labor-intensive and an au-
tomated approach is clearly called for. We are also
working towards a more detailed comparison of
the coverage of the lexicogrammatical resources
of KPML with those of parsing systems that are
similarly theoretically-dedicated (e.g., the HPSG-
based English Resource Grammar (ERG) (Copes-
take and Flickinger, 2002) contained in LinGO
(Oepen et al., 2002)). Thus, the idea presented
here is also motivated by the need to provide a ba-
sis for comparing grammar coverage across pars-
ing and generation systems more generally.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. First, we present the main features of the
KPML system (Section 2). Second, we describe the
steps involved in annotation by generation, from
the generation output (KPML internal generation
record) to an XML representation and its refine-
ment to an XML multi-layer representation (Sec-
tion 3). Section 4 concludes the paper with a criti-
cal assessment of the proposed approach and a dis-
cussion of the prospects for application in the con-
struction of corpora comparable in size and qual-
ity to existing treebanks (such as, for example, the
Penn Treebank for English (Marcus et al., 1993)
or the TIGER Treebank for German (Brants et al.,
2002)). Since our description here has the status
of a progress report of work still in its beginning
stages, we cannot yet provide the results of de-
tailed evaluation. In the final section, therefore, we
emphasize the concrete steps that we are currently
taking in order to be able carry out the detailed
evaluations necessary.

2 Natural language generation with
KPML
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994525">
The KPML system is a mature grammar devel-
opment environment for supporting large-scale
grammar engineering work for natural language
generation using multilingual systemic-functional
grammars (Bateman et al., 2005). Grammars
within this framework consist of large lattices of
grammatical features, each of which brings con-
straints on syntactic structure. The features are
also linked back to semantic configurations so that
they can be selected appropriately when given a
semantic specification as input. The result of gen-
erating with a systemic-functional grammar with
KPML is then a rich feature-based representation
distributed across a relatively simple structural
backbone. Each node of the syntactic represen-
tation corresponds to an element of structure and
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999983364705883">
typically receives on the order of 50-100 linguistic
features, called the feature selection. Since within
systemic-functional grammars, it is the features
of the feature selection that carry most of the de-
scriptive load, we can see each feature selection as
an exhaustive description of its associated syntac-
tic constituent. Generation within KPML normally
proceeds on the basis of a semantic input specifi-
cation which triggers particular feature selections
from the grammar via a mediating linguistic ontol-
ogy.
The features captured in a systemic-functional
generation resource are drawn from the four com-
ponents of functional meaning postulated within
systemic-functional grammar: the ideational, ex-
pressing content-related decisions, the logical, ex-
pressing logical dependencies, the interpersonal,
expressing interactional, evaluative and speech act
information, and the textual, expressing how each
element contributes to an unfolding text. It is in
this extremely rich combination of features that
we see significant value in exploring the re-use of
such grammars for annotation purposes and cor-
pus enrichment.
For annotation purposes, we employ some
of the alternative modes of generation that
are provided by the full grammar development
environment—it is precisely these that allow for
ready incorporation and application within the cor-
pus annotation task. One of the simplest ways in
which generation can be achieved during grammar
development, for example, is by directly select-
ing linguistic features from the grammar. This can
therefore mimic directly the task of annotation: if
we consider a target sentence (or other linguistic
unit) to be annotated, then selecting the necessary
features to generate that unit is equivalent to anno-
tating that unit in a corpus with respect to a very
extensive set of corpus annotation features.
Several additional benefits immediately acrue
from the use of a generator for this task. First,
the generator actually constructs the sentence (or
other unit) as determined by the feature selection.
This means that it is possible to obtain immedi-
ate feedback concerning the correctness and com-
pleteness of the annotation choices with respect to
the target. A non-matching structure can be gener-
ated if: (a) an inappropriate linguistic feature has
been selected, (b) the linguistic resources do not
cover the target to be annotated, or (c) a combina-
tion of these. In order to minimise the influence
of (b), we only work with large-scale grammatical
resources whose coverage is potentially sufficient
to cover most of the target corpus. Further cor-
pus instances that lie beyond the capabilities of the
generation grammar used are an obvious source of
requirements for extensions to that grammar.
Second, the architecture of the KPML system
also allows for other kinds of annotation support.
During grammar development it is often required
that guidance is given directly to the semantics-
grammar linking mappings: this is achieved by
providing particular ‘answers’ to pre-defined ‘in-
quiries’. This allows for a significantly more
abstract and ‘intention’-near interaction with the
grammatical resource that can be more readily
comprehensible to a user than the details of the
grammatical features. This option is therefore also
available for annotation.
Moreover, the semantic specifications used rely
on a specified linguistic ontology that defines par-
ticular semantic types. These types can also be
used directly in order to constrain whole collec-
tions of grammatical features. Providing this kind
of guidance during annotation can also, on the one
hand, simplify the process of annotation while, on
the other, produce a semantic level of annotation
for the corpus.
In the following sections, we see a selection of
these layers of information working in annotation
in more detail, showing that the kinds of informa-
tion produced during generation corresponds ex-
tremely closely to the kinds of rich annotations
currently being targetted for sophisticated corpus
presentation.

The output produced by KPML when being used
for generation is a recursive structure with the cho-
sen lexical items at the leaves. Figure 1 shows the
output tree for the sample sentence “However they
will step up their presence in the next year”.
The nodes of this structure may be freely an-
notated by the user or application system to con-
tain further information: e.g., for passing through
hyperlinks and URLs directly with the semantics
when generating hypertext. Most users simply see
the result of flattening this structure into a string:
the generated sentence or utterance.

formation that is employed by the generator dur-
ing generation. Therefore, since we are using
the grammar development environment rather than
simply the generator component, we also have the
possibility of working directly with the internal
structures that KPML employs for display and de-
bugging of resources during development. These
internal structures contain a complete record of
the information provided to the generation pro-
cess and the generator decisions (including which
grammatical features have been selected) that have
been made during the construction of each unit.
This internal record structure is again a recursive
structure corresponding directly to the syntactic
structure of the generated result and with each
node having the information slots:
constituent:
{identifier, \\ unique id for the unit
concept, \\ link to the semantic concept expressed
spelling, \\ the substring for this portion of structure
gloss, \\ a label for use in inter-lineal glosses
features, \\ the set of grammatical features for this unit
lexeme, \\ the lexeme chosen to cover this unit (if any)
annotation, \\ user-specified information
functions \\ the grammatical functions the unit expresses
}
An extract from such an internal record structure
encoded in XML is given in the Appendix (5.1).
To support annotation, we make use of the XML-
export capabilities of KPML (cf. (Bateman and
Hartley, 2000)) in order to provide these com-
pleted structures in a form suitable for passing on
to the next stage of corpus annotation within an
XML-based multi-layer framework.

Systemic-functional analysis is inherently multi-
dimensional in that SFL adopts more than one view
on a linguistic unit. Here, we focus on three anno-
tationally relevant dimensions: axis (features and
functions), unit (clause, group/phrase, word, mor-
pheme) and metafunction (ideational, logical, in-
terpersonal and textual). Each metafunction may
chunk up a given string (e.g., a clause unit) in

different ways, thus potentially creating overlap-
ping hierarchies. This is depicted schematically
for the running example in Figure 2. For instance,
in this example, according to the textual meta-
function, “however they” constitutes a segment
(Theme) and according to the interpersonal meta-
function, “they will” constitutes another segment
(Mood).
In order to be able to use the KPML output for
annotation purposes, we adopt a multi-layer model
that allows the representation of these different de-
scriptional dimensions as separate layers superim-
posed on a given string (cf. (Teich et al., 2005)).
The transformation from the KPML output to the
concrete multi-layer model adopted is defined in
XSLT.
From the KPML internal record structure we
use the information slots of identifier, spelling,
features, and functions. Each entry in the func-
tion slot is associated with one metafunctional as-
pect. For each metafunctional aspect, an annota-
tion layer is created for each constituent unit (e.g.,
a clause) holding all associated functions together
with the substrings they describe (see Figure 3 for
the ideational functions contained in the clause in
the running example).
An additional layer holds the complete con-
stituent structure of the clause (cf. Figure 4 for the
corresponding extract from the running example),

4 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978272476190476">
Although it is clear that the kind of informational
structures produced during generation with more
developed KPML grammars align quite closely
with that targetted by sophisticated corpus anno-
tation, there are several issues that need to be ad-
dressed in order to turn this process into a prac-
tical annotation alternative. Those which we are
currently investigating centre around usability and
coverage.
2To improve readability, we provide the integrated repre-
sentation rather than the stand-off representation which aligns
the different layers by using character offsets.
Usability/effort. Users need to be trained in pro-
viding information to guide the generation pro-
cess. This guidance is either in the form of di-
rect selections of grammatical features, in which
case the user needs to know when the features ap-
ply, or in the form of semantic specifications, in
which case the user needs information concerning
the appropriate semantic classification according
to the constructs of the linguistic ontology. One of
the methods by which the problem of knowing the
import of grammatical features may be alleviated
is to link each feature with sets of already anno-
tated/generated corpus examples. Thus, if a user
is unsure concerning a feature, she can call for
examples to be displayed in which the particular
linguistic unit carrying the feature is highlighted.
Even more useful is a further option which shows
not only examples containing the feature, but con-
trasting examples showing where the feature has
applied and where it has not. This provides users
with online training during the use of the system
for annotation. The mechanisms for showing ex-
amples and contrasting sets of generated sentences
for each feature were originally provided as part
of a teaching aid built on top of KPML: this allows
students to explore a grammar by means of the ef-
fects that each set of contrasting features brings
for generated structures. For complex grammars
this appears to offer a viable alternative to precise
documentation—especially for less skilled users.
Coverage. When features have been selected, it
may still be the case that the correct target string
has not been generated due to limited coverage
of grammar and/or semantics. This is indicative
of the need to extend the grammatical resources
further. A further alternative that we are explor-
ing is to allow users to specify the correspondence
between the units generated and the actual target
string more flexibly. This is covered by two cases:
(i) that additional material is in the target string
that was not generated, and (ii) that the surface
order of constituents is not exactly that produced
by the generator. In both cases we can refine the
stand-off annotation so that the structural result
of generation can be linked to the actual string.
Thus manual correction consists of minor align-
ment statements between generated structure and
string.
Certain other information that may not be avail-
able to the generator, such as lexical entries, can be
constructed semi-automatically on-the-fly, again
</bodyText>

using the information produced in the generation
process (i.e., by collecting the lexical classifica-
tion features and adding lexemes containing those
features). This method can be applied for all open
word classes.
Next steps. In our future work, we will be car-
rying out an extensive annotation experiment with
the prediction that annotation time is not higher
than for interactive annotation from a parsing per-
spective. TIGER, for example, reports 10 min-
utes per sentence as an average annotation time.
We expect an experienced KPML user to be sig-
nificantly faster because the process of generation
or feature selection explicitly leads the annotator
through precisely those features that are relevant
and possible given the connectivity of the feature
lattice defined by the grammar. Annotation then
proceeds first by selecting the features that apply
and then by aligning the generated structure with
the corpus instance: both potentially rather rapid
stages. Also, we would expect to achieve similar
coverage as reported by (Baldwin et al., 2004) for
ERG when applied to a random 20,000 string sam-
ple of the BNC due to the coverage of the existing
grammars.
The results of such investigations will be SFL-
treebanks, analogous to such treebanks produced
using dependency approaches, LFG, HPSG, etc.
These treebanks will then support the subsequent
learning of annotations for automatic processing.

<abstract confidence="0.996882272727273">As the interest in annotated corpora is spreading, there is increasing concern with using existing language technology for corpus processing. In this paper we explore the idea of using natural language for corpus annotation. Resources for generation systems often focus on areas of linguistic variability that are under-represented in analysis-directed approaches. Therefore, making use of generation resources promises some significant extensions in the kinds of annotation information that can be captured. We focus here on exploring the use of MultiLingual) generation system for corpus annotation. We describe the kinds of linguistic inforcovered in show the involved in creating a standard representation from generation output.</abstract>

Here, we focus on three annotationally relevant dimensions: axis (features and functions), unit (clause, group/phrase, word, morpheme) and metafunction (ideational, logical, interpersonal and textual).

Although this may at first glance seem counter-intuitive, in fact a generator, similar to a parser, creates rather complex linguistic descriptions (which are ultimately realized as strings). In our current investigations, we are exploring the use of these complex linguistic descriptions for creating annotations. We believe that this may offer a worthwhile alternative or extension of corpus annotation methods which may alleviate some of the problems encountered in parsing-based approaches. The generation system we are using is the KPML (Komet-Penman MultiLingual; (Bateman, 1997)) system. One potential advantage of KPML over other generation systems and over many parsing systems is its multi-stratal design. The kinds of linguistic information included in KPML range from formal-syntactic (PoS, phrase structure) to functional-syntactic (syntactic functions), semantic (semantic roles/frames) and discoursal (e.g., theme-rheme, given-new). Also, since KPML has been applied to generate texts from a broad spectrum of domains, its lexicogrammatical resources cover a wide variety of registers—another potential advantage in the analysis of unrestricted text.

Other desirable kinds of information are thus lacking (e.g., syntactic functions, semantic roles, theme-rheme). • Output representation. Typically, a parsing output is represented in a theory-specific way (e.g., in the case of LFG or HPSG parsers, a feature structure). Such output does not conform to the common practices in corpus representation.1 Thus, it has to be mapped onto one of the standardly used data models for corpora (e.g., annotation graphs (Bird and Liberman, 2001) or multi-layer hierarchies (Sperberg-McQueen and Huitfeldt, 2001; Teich et al., 2001)) and transformed to a commonly employed format, typically XML. 1This is in contrast to the output representation of shallow parsers which have often been developed with the goal of corpus processing. 86 Proceedings of the Workshop on Frontiers in Linguistically Annotated Corpora 2006, pages 86–93, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics In spite of these difficulties, there is a general consensus that the reward for exploring deep processing techniques to build up small to mediums</context>

Section 4 concludes the paper with a critical assessment of the proposed approach and a discussion of the prospects for application in the construction of corpora comparable in size and quality to existing treebanks (such as, for example, the Penn Treebank for English (Marcus et al., 1993) or the TIGER Treebank for German (Brants et al., 2002)).

Also, since KPML has been applied to generate texts from a broad spectrum of domains, its lexicogrammatical resources cover a wide variety of registers—another potential advantage in the analysis of unrestricted text. As well as our general concern with investigating the possible benefits of applying generation resources to the corpus annotation task, we are also more specifically concerned with a series of experiments involving the KPML system as such. Here, for example, we are working towards the construction of “treebanks” based on the theory of Systemic-Functional Linguistics (SFL; (Halliday, 2004)), so as to be able to empirically test some of SFL’s hypotheses concerning patterns of instantiation of the linguistic system in authentic texts. Annotating the variety of linguistic categories given in SFL manually is very labor-intensive and an automated approach is clearly called for.

First, we present the main features of the KPML system (Section 2). Second, we describe the steps involved in annotation by generation, from the generation output (KPML internal generation record) to an XML representation and its refinement to an XML multi-layer representation (Section 3). Section 4 concludes the paper with a critical assessment of the proposed approach and a discussion of the prospects for application in the construction of corpora comparable in size and quality to existing treebanks (such as, for example, the Penn Treebank for English (Marcus et al., 1993) or the TIGER Treebank for German (Brants et al., 2002)). Since our description here has the status of a progress report of work still in its beginning stages, we cannot yet provide the results of detailed evaluation. In the final section, therefore, we emphasize the concrete steps that we are currently taking in order to be able carry out the detailed evaluations necessary. 2 Natural language generation with KPML The KPML system is a mature grammar development environment for supporting large-scale grammar engineering work for natural language generation using multilingual systemic-functional</context>

This is depicted schematically for the running example in Figure 2. For instance, in this example, according to the textual metafunction, “however they” constitutes a segment (Theme) and according to the interpersonal metafunction, “they will” constitutes another segment (Mood). In order to be able to use the KPML output for annotation purposes, we adopt a multi-layer model that allows the representation of these different descriptional dimensions as separate layers superimposed on a given string (cf. (Teich et al., 2005)). The transformation from the KPML output to the concrete multi-layer model adopted is defined in XSLT. From the KPML internal record structure we use the information slots of identifier, spelling, features, and functions. Each entry in the function slot is associated with one metafunctional aspect. For each metafunctional aspect, an annotation layer is created for each constituent unit (e.g., a clause) holding all associated functions together with the substrings they describe (see Figure 3 for the ideational functions contained in the clause in the running example).
