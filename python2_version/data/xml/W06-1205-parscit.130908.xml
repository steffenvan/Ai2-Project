<bodyText confidence="0.99982425">
Complex Predicates or CPs are multi-
word complexes functioning as single
verbal units. CPs are particularly
pervasive in Hindi and other Indo-
Aryan languages, but an usage account
driven by corpus-based identification
of these constructs has not been
possible since single-language systems
based on rules and statistical
approaches require reliable tools (POS
taggers, parsers, etc.) that are
unavailable for Hindi. This paper
highlights the development of first
such database based on the simple idea
of projecting POS tags across an
English-Hindi parallel corpus. The CP
types considered include adjective-verb
(AV), noun-verb (NV), adverb-verb
(Adv-V), and verb-verb (VV)
composites. CPs are hypothesized
where a verb in English is projected
onto a multi-word sequence in Hindi.
While this process misses some CPs,
those that are detected appear to be
more reliable (83% precision, 46%
recall). The resulting database lists
usage instances of 1439 CPs in 4400
sentences.

<bodyText confidence="0.99997148">
A &amp;quot;pain in the neck&amp;quot; (Sag et al., 2002) for
NLP in languages of the Indo-Aryan family
(e.g. Hindi-Urdu, Bangla and Kashmiri) is the
fact that most verbs (nearly half of all
instances in Hindi) occur as complex
predicates - multi-word complexes which
function as a single verbal unit in terms of
argument and event structure (Hook, 1993;
Butt and Geuder, 2003; Raina and Mukerjee,
2005). Moreover, most of these languages
being resource-poor, even a proper corpus-
based characterization of such CPs has
remained an elusive goal.
In this paper we construct the first corpus-
based lexicon of CPs in Hindi based on
projecting POS tags across parallel English-
Hindi corpora. While such approaches
sometimes leave out some CPs, the ones that
are identified are seen to be quite robust. As a
result, this appears to be a good first approach
for identifying the majority of CPs along with
usage data. Moreover, since the language
specific input in the procedure is minimal, it
can be easily extended to other languages with
similar multi word expressions.

2 Complex Predicates

<bodyText confidence="0.994981428571428">
CPs are characterized by a predicate or host -
typically a noun (N), adjective (A), verb (V),
or adverb (Adv) - followed by a light verb
(LV), a grammaticalized version of a main
verb, which contributes little telic significance
to the composite predicate. As an example, the
English verb &amp;quot;describe&amp;quot; may be rendered in
Hindi as the Noun-Verb complex ‘qd�F +
zt’, varNan kar, &amp;quot;description + do&amp;quot;. Analysis
based on a non-CP lexicon might assign the
verbal head as kar (do), whereas functional
aspects such as the argument structure are
determined by the noun host varNan
&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;. An example of a V-V CP may

be ‘कर + दे’, kar de &amp;quot;do+give&amp;quot;, where the light
verb de “give” imposes a completive aspect on
the action kar “do”.
Identifying such constructs is a significant
hurdle for NLP tasks ranging from phrasal
parsing (Ray et al., 2003, Shrivastava et al.,
2005), translation (where each complex may
be treated as a lexical unit in the target
language), predicate-argument analysis, to
semantic delineation. In addition to the
computational aspects, a mere listing of all
CPs occurring in the corpus would provide an
important resource for tasks such as
constructing WordNets (Narayan et al.,2002)
and linguistic analysis of CPs (Butt and
Geuder, 2003).
Rule-based approaches to identifying CPs
are not very effective since there do not seem
to be any clear set of rules that can be used to
distinguish CPs from non-CP constructs
(contrast, for example, the composite CP
‘अनुमित दे’ anumati de &amp;quot;permission+give&amp;quot; with
the non-composite N-V structure ‘िकताब दे
kitaab de &amp;quot;give the book&amp;quot;). Even where such
rules do exist, they depend on semantic
properties such as the fact that book is a
physical object which can be given in the
physical sense (Raina and Mukerjee, 2005).
However, in the translated form, the former
may show up as a verb, whereas the latter
invariably will be a N+V, so the tag projection
would rule out the latter as a CP.
Here we adopt a parallel corpus-based
approach to creating a database of complex
predicates in Hindi. The procedure can
potentially be duplicated to most Indo-Aryan
languages. The motivation is that a CP may be
translated as a direct verb in other languages,
and POS Projection across Parallel Corpora
then project a tag of Verb for this expression in
the source language. Additional linguistic
constraints are used to determine if the multi-
word cluster qualifies as a CP. These include a
check list of LVs that can occur with A, N, V
and Adv constituents of a multi word
predicate.
Let us consider some examples from the CP
lexicon constructed from the EMILLE parallel
corpus (McEnery et al., 2000) of 200,000
words, collected from leaflets prepared by the
UK government for immigrants. Examples of
these different complexes may be:

Of the four classes cited above, the NV and
AV classes are the most productive. The AdvV
class is highly restricted, confined to a few
adverbs. The VV class is highly selective for
its constituents, apparently driven by semantic
considerations.
Identifying CPs in text is crucial to
processing since it serves as a clausal head,
and other elements in the phrase are licensed
by the complex as a whole and not by the
verbal head. The semantic import of the host-
verb complex varies along a composability
continuum, at one end of which we have
purely idiomatic CPs, while at the other end,
the CPs may be recoverable from its
constituents. For example, ‘eft+fit’,
vyavhaar kar, &amp;quot;behave+do&amp;quot; has a sense of
&amp;quot;use,treat&amp;quot; in English, reflecting clearly an
idiomatic usage.
Detecting CPs is made difficult by the
differing degrees of productivity for different
classes of open-class host, which reflects the
applicability of unrestricted rules. Also, verbs
participating in CPs are very selective; e.g. in
NV and AV CPs the verb is typically restricted
to ho, kar and the like, whereas in VV
constructs ho reflects auxiliary usage, but a
different set of verbs appear. The open class
word (host) tends to be uninflected, and only
the light verb (LV) carries tense, agreement
and aspect markers. Even the host V
participating in a VV CP is always uninflected.
As an instance of the difficulty in detecting
CPs, consider the so called permissive CP
(Hook, 1993; Butt and Geuder, 2003), as in the
karne+de “do-nom +give” example here,
where the host verb appears to be inflected:

<bodyText confidence="0.9783465">
However, this does not actually reflect CP
usage, and is better parsed as:

<bodyText confidence="0.888944">
Another challenge for CP identification is
that the constituents may be separated –
sometimes quite widely.

3 CPs from Parallel Projection

<bodyText confidence="0.99996836">
Identifying MWEs from corpora is clearly
an area of increasing research emphasis. For
resource-rich languages, one may use a parse
tree and look for mutual information statistics
in head-complement collocations, and also
compare it with other &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot; collocations to
determine if something is unusual about a
given construct (Lin, 1999). As of now
however, even POS-tagging remains a
challenge for languages such as Hindi, thereby
making it necessary to seek alternate methods.
Parallel corpus based approaches to
inducing monolingual part-of-speech taggers,
base noun-phrase bracketers, named-entity
taggers and morphological analyzers for
French, Chinese and other languages have
shown quite promising results (Yarowsky et
al., 2001). These approaches use minimal
linguistic input and have been increasingly
effective with the growth in the availability of
large parallel corpuses. The algorithm
essentially attempts to word-align the target
language sentences with the source language
sentences and then use a probabilistic model
try to project the linguistic information from
the source language. Since these are statistical
algorithms, the accuracy of results depends on
the size of the corpus used.
In our approach, we first use a similar
approach to word-align an English-Hindi
parallel corpus. The English sentences are
tagged and the tags are projected to Hindi
sentences. We observe that words which are
tagged as verbs by projection and have POS
tag as N, A, Adv or V in the Hindi lexicon, and
are followed by an LV, are usually CPs.
Clearly the CP detection is limited to those
instances where a CP in the target language is
translated as a single verb in English. For
example, a phrase such as ��f� t jawaab de,
&amp;quot;answer give&amp;quot;, may be rendered in English
either as the verb “answer” or as the English
CP &amp;quot;give answer&amp;quot;. In the latter case (an
example appearing quite frequently in this
corpus), the correct POS projection would
label jawaab as [N answer], thus failing to
detect the CP. While this may not be
significant in certain tasks (e.g. translation), it
may be relevant in others (e.g. semantic
processing).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991715">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.994831947368421">
Furthermore, the POS tagging process is
inherently biased towards projecting tags for
frequently encountered constituents first, and
this may lead to some constituents in certain
CPs being flagged with their normal POS tags,
resulting in missed CPs. However, this does
not result in false positives, since non-CP
constructs often fail on other criteria (e.g. list
of LVs).
For reasons discussed above, many CPs are
not identifiable through parallel corpus
methods. Some examples include ‘अिधकार
होते’, ‘पैदा करने’, ‘हािन होती’. Our database
is therefore correspondingly thin for these
types of CPs.
With VV CPs, it is difficult to distinguish
between CPs and other related structures such
as the passive construct or serial verbs. These
are illustrated below.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.828899125">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987866444444444">
“That boy gave me his book and went away.”
It appears that passive can be reliably ruled
out using the root verb criterion for VVs, since
the main verb in passive is always in an
inflected form. No comparable formal criterion
exists for the serial verb, where also the POS
tagger will identify both constituents as verbs.
However, these verbs are relatively rare
compared to CPs.

We used the EMILLE1 corpus Hindi-English
parallel corpus, with approximately 200,000
words in non-sentenced aligned translations in
Unicode 16 format (McEnery et al., 2000). The
texts consist of different types of information
leaflets originally in English, along with
translations in Hindi, Bangla, Gujarati and a
number of South Asian languages. Closer
analysis of the corpus reveals that the corpus is
not completely sentence aligned and also that
the translations are not very correct in many
cases. Hindi versions of the manuals tend to be
more verbose than their English translations.
For the word alignment algorithm we
needed a sentence aligned corpus but due to
the small size of the parallel corpus, the
standard sentence alignment systems did not
give very high accuracy levels. Therefore, the
whole data was manually sentence aligned to
produce a sentence aligned parallel corpus of
about nine thousand sentences and 140
thousand words which is used in this work.

We have used IBM models proposed by
Brown (Brown et al., 1993) for word aligning
the parallel corpus. The IBM models have
been widely used in statistical machine

sentences to account for the unaligned Hindi
words from the corresponding Hindi sentence.

4.3 Tagging English Sentences

The English sentences are POS-tagged using
the Brill Tagger (Brill, 1994), a rule based
tagger which uses more or less the same tags
as the Penn Treebank project (Marcus, 1994).
Since for our purposes, we did not need a very
detailed subcategorization of the tag set for
Hindi, the English tag set was reduced by
merging the subcategorization tags of a few
categories. Thus all noun distinctions in the
Pen Treebank tagset based on number, person
etc were merged in our treatment of the Noun
class. Similarly in the case of verbs, we
merged distinctions based on tense, person,
aspect and participles etc. Subclasses of
adverbs and case forms of pronouns were also
merged. Rest of the POS categories were
retained. The “NULL” word in the English
sentences, used for unaligned Hindi words in
the parallel corpus, was given a “NULL” tag.

4.4 Projection of Tags to Hindi

<bodyText confidence="0.999535291666667">
The reduced English tags were projected to
Hindi words based on the word alignments
obtained earlier. A sample alignment and
tagged projection is shown in Figure 1. As the
figure shows, postpositional markers, which
are relatively more frequent in Hindi are
mapped to the “NULL” word in the English
sentence.
Since the amount of training data is very
small, the statistical word alignment algorithm
is not adequate enough to align all words
correctly. To overcome this weakness, we
apply some filtering conditions to remove
alignment errors, especially in smaller
sentences. This filtering is based on two
parameters: a) Fertility count (rf), which is
defined as the number of Hindi words an
English word maps to, and b) Acceptance level
(k), defined as the number of words acceptable
in a sentence with fertility count greater than
equal to rf. These two parameters are selected
to minimize errors in the groundtruth sample-
set, and the resulting filtering heuristics used
are presented in Table 1.

English. So if the projected tag of a Hindi
word is Verb and the normal POS tag of the
word in the Hindi dictionary is N, A, V or Adv

members from the LV set, then we classify the
multi word expression as N+V, A+V, V+V, or

4.7 Errors in CP identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916157894737">
CP identification in the test data set
involved certain ground truth decisions such as
excluding verbal composites with regular
auxiliary verb है, hai corresponding to the
English finite verb ‘be’ and the progressive
‘रहा’ raha ‘-ing (progressive)’. CPs with
idiomatic usage were included, and so were the
CPs with a passive verb, although the latter
were not counted in computational scores. The
testing was done on a small set of about 120
groundtruth sentences in which the CP’s were
carefully identified manually. We get a
precision of about 82.5% and a recall of 40%
with our CP finding algorithm. If the idiomatic
CPs is not considered the recall goes upto
46%.
Several types of errors are observed in the
corpus-derived results. A False Negative
(missed CP) error arising due to the English
complex predicate is shown in Figure 3. A
number of False Positives arise due to
inadequacy in the Hindi dictionary – the online
dictionary of Hindi we used was missing many
lexemes. A further problem is homography –
e.g. the word kii (do-past) appears both as an
possessive marker, as well as the past-tense
form for the verb kara (do), occurring
frequently (with jaa, go) in adjectival clause
constructions. This has been mis-tagged in
about one in ten instances (approx 0.2% cases),
with hosts such as shikaayat (complaint), baat
(talk), dekhvaal (looking-after), madad (help)
etc. Similarly, the word un can appear as a
noun (wool) or a pronoun (he). Furthermore,
while considerable care was taken to manually
sentence align the parallel corpus, a number of
typos and other problems remain, some of
them show up as false positives.

compare these with English phrasal verbs like

discontinuity. However, owing to the relatively

encoded in a computational lexicon is a
complex matter that takes us beyond CP
identification (Villavicencio et al. 2004). But
while rule-based identification of such
constructs is problematic, we feel that POS-tag
projection holds considerable promise in this
direction.
In the algorithm above we have only
considered the target language (Hindi) tags
after the parallel tagging is completed. If in
addition, we also consider the source language
tag and its radiation the CP probabilities may
be redefined in a manner that helps capture
some discontinuous CPs as well. Thus, if
English “complain” radiates to shikaayat and
kara, the inherent CP can be detected even in
the presence of an intermediate phrase. An
example from the POS-tagged data exhibiting
discontinous CP detection is presented in

5 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.9999384">
In this work we have presented a
preliminary approach to a corpus-based
lexicon of CPs in Hindi based on projecting
POS tags across parallel English-Hindi
corpora. Since the approach involves minimal
linguistic analysis, it is easily extendable to
other languages which exhibit similar CP
constructs, provided the availability of a POS
lexicon.
Clearly, a number of problems will remain
with any such approach. The limitiations of
the parallel POS tagging is that certain kinds of
maps may never be found (as in parallel CPs in
source and target languages). On the other
hand, some of our accuracies, we feel, would
improve considerably given a larger parallel
corpus and more refined use of a Hindi
lexicon.
In addition to the handling of discontinuous
CPs hinted at above, another aspect that we
would like to consider next is to tune some of
the parameters of the parallel tagging
algorithm, such as specifically tuning the
distortion and fertility probabilities in
situations (e.g. English verbs) that are likely to
manifest CPs in Hindi.
We feel that beyond the usefulness of this
initial approach, the database of CPs
constructed in this work may in itself be an
important linguistic resource for Hindi.
Furthermore, the approach can possibly be
used to detect MWEs that radiate to a single
lexical structure in another language, e.g.
phrasal verbs in English.
Acknowledgements We acknowledge a
comment from an anonymous reviewer
regarding discontinuous CPs which led us to
investigate them (Figure 4 above). However, it
was not possible to report this important
exception for the entire database.

<abstract confidence="0.996702586206897">Complex Predicates or CPs are multiword complexes functioning as single verbal units. CPs are particularly pervasive in Hindi and other Indo- Aryan languages, but an usage account driven by corpus-based identification of these constructs has not been possible since single-language systems based on rules and statistical approaches require reliable tools (POS taggers, parsers, etc.) that are unavailable for Hindi. This paper highlights the development of first such database based on the simple idea of projecting POS tags across an English-Hindi parallel corpus. The CP types considered include adjective-verb (AV), noun-verb (NV), adverb-verb (Adv-V), and verb-verb (VV) composites. CPs are hypothesized where a verb in English is projected onto a multi-word sequence in Hindi. While this process misses some CPs, those that are detected appear to be more reliable (83% precision, 46% recall). The resulting database lists usage instances of 1439 CPs in 4400 sentences.</abstract>

Hindi versions of the manuals tend to be more verbose than their English translations. For the word alignment algorithm we needed a sentence aligned corpus but due to the small size of the parallel corpus, the standard sentence alignment systems did not give very high accuracy levels. Therefore, the whole data was manually sentence aligned to produce a sentence aligned parallel corpus of about nine thousand sentences and 140 thousand words which is used in this work. 4.2 Word alignment We have used IBM models proposed by Brown (Brown et al., 1993) for word aligning the parallel corpus. The IBM models have been widely used in statistical machine translation. Given a Hindi sentence h, we seek the English sentence e that maximizes P(e |h); the &amp;quot;most likely” translation.

Identifying such constructs is a significant hurdle for NLP tasks ranging from phrasal parsing (Ray et al., 2003, Shrivastava et al., 2005), translation (where each complex may be treated as a lexical unit in the target language), predicate-argument analysis, to semantic delineation. In addition to the computational aspects, a mere listing of all CPs occurring in the corpus would provide an important resource for tasks such as constructing WordNets (Narayan et al.,2002) and linguistic analysis of CPs (Butt and Geuder, 2003). Rule-based approaches to identifying CPs are not very effective since there do not seem to be any clear set of rules that can be used to distinguish CPs from non-CP constructs (contrast, for example, the composite CP ‘अनुमित दे’ anumati de &amp;quot;permission+give&amp;quot; with the non-composite N-V structure ‘िकताब दे kitaab de &amp;quot;give the book&amp;quot;). Even where such rules do exist, they depend on semantic properties such as the fact that book is a physical object which can be given in the physical sense (Raina and Mukerjee, 2005). However, in the translated form, the former may show up as a verb, whereas the la</context>

The open class word (host) tends to be uninflected, and only the light verb (LV) carries tense, agreement and aspect markers. Even the host V participating in a VV CP is always uninflected. As an instance of the difficulty in detecting CPs, consider the so called permissive CP (Hook, 1993; Butt and Geuder, 2003), as in the karne+de “do-nom +give” example here, where the host verb appears to be inflected: (5) Raam ne sitaa ko kaam karne diyaa Ram-erg sita-acc work do-nom give-past “Ram let Sita do the work” However, this does not actually reflect CP usage, and is better parsed as: (6) [S [NP raam ne] [VP [NP sitaa ko] [VP kaam karne] [V diyaa] VP] S] Another challenge for CP identification is that the constituents may be separated – sometimes quite widely. 3 CPs from Parallel Projection Identifying MWEs from corpora is clearly an area of increasing research emphasis.

The motivation is that a CP may be translated as a direct verb in other languages, and POS Projection across Parallel Corpora then project a tag of Verb for this expression in the source language. Additional linguistic constraints are used to determine if the multiword cluster qualifies as a CP. These include a check list of LVs that can occur with A, N, V and Adv constituents of a multi word predicate. Let us consider some examples from the CP lexicon constructed from the EMILLE parallel corpus (McEnery et al., 2000) of 200,000 words, collected from leaflets prepared by the UK government for immigrants. Examples of these different complexes may be: (1) N+V: वणर्न + कर varNan kar “description + do”: पैके ज या स्तुत इश्तेहार में जैसे paikej yaa prastut ishtehaar mein jaise package or present advertisement in as वणर्न िकया गया हो, ठीक वैसा varNan kiyaa gayaa ho ThIk vaisaa description do-past go-past be-pres exact same ही होगा hi hogaa emph be-fut “It will be exactly as described on the package or the display advertisement.” (2) A+V: उपलब्ध है upalabdh hai “available+ be”: सहायता समीप ही उपलब्ध है। Saha</context>

No comparable formal criterion exists for the serial verb, where also the POS tagger will identify both constituents as verbs. However, these verbs are relatively rare compared to CPs. 4 Hindi-English POS Projection 4.1 Data Resources and Preprocessing We used the EMILLE1 corpus Hindi-English parallel corpus, with approximately 200,000 words in non-sentenced aligned translations in Unicode 16 format (McEnery et al., 2000). The texts consist of different types of information leaflets originally in English, along with translations in Hindi, Bangla, Gujarati and a number of South Asian languages. Closer analysis of the corpus reveals that the corpus is not completely sentence aligned and also that the translations are not very correct in many cases.

This paper highlights the development of first such database based on the simple idea of projecting POS tags across an English-Hindi parallel corpus. The CP types considered include adjective-verb (AV), noun-verb (NV), adverb-verb (Adv-V), and verb-verb (VV) composites. CPs are hypothesized where a verb in English is projected onto a multi-word sequence in Hindi. While this process misses some CPs, those that are detected appear to be more reliable (83% precision, 46% recall). The resulting database lists usage instances of 1439 CPs in 4400 sentences. 1 Introduction A &amp;quot;pain in the neck&amp;quot; (Sag et al., 2002) for NLP in languages of the Indo-Aryan family (e.g. Hindi-Urdu, Bangla and Kashmiri) is the fact that most verbs (nearly half of all instances in Hindi) occur as complex predicates - multi-word complexes which function as a single verbal unit in terms of argument and event structure (Hook, 1993; Butt and Geuder, 2003; Raina and Mukerjee, 2005). Moreover, most of these languages being resource-poor, even a proper corpusbased characterization of such CPs has remained an elusive goal. In this paper we construct the first corpusbased lexicon of CPs in Hindi based on projecting POS tags across par</context>

Identifying such constructs is a significant hurdle for NLP tasks ranging from phrasal parsing (Ray et al., 2003, Shrivastava et al., 2005), translation (where each complex may be treated as a lexical unit in the target language), predicate-argument analysis, to semantic delineation. In addition to the computational aspects, a mere listing of all CPs occurring in the corpus would provide an important resource for tasks such as constructing WordNets (Narayan et al.,2002) and linguistic analysis of CPs (Butt and Geuder, 2003). Rule-based approaches to identifying CPs are not very effective since there do not seem to be any clear set of rules that can be used to distinguish CPs from non-CP constructs (contrast, for example, the comp</context>

How these structures are to be encoded in a computational lexicon is a complex matter that takes us beyond CP identification (Villavicencio et al. 2004). But while rule-based identification of such constructs is problematic, we feel that POS-tag projection holds considerable promise in this direction. In the algorithm above we have only considered the target language (Hindi) tags after the parallel tagging is completed. If in addition, we also consider the source language tag and its radiation the CP probabilities may be redefined in a manner that helps capture some discontinuous CPs as well. Thus, if English “complain” radiates to shikaayat and kara, the inherent CP can be detected even in the presence of an intermediate phrase. An example f</context>

As of now however, even POS-tagging remains a challenge for languages such as Hindi, thereby making it necessary to seek alternate methods. Parallel corpus based approaches to inducing monolingual part-of-speech taggers, base noun-phrase bracketers, named-entity taggers and morphological analyzers for French, Chinese and other languages have shown quite promising results (Yarowsky et al., 2001). These approaches use minimal linguistic input and have been increasingly effective with the growth in the availability of large parallel corpuses. The algorithm essentially attempts to word-align the target language sentences with the source language sentences and then use a probabilistic model try to project the linguistic information from the source language. Since these are statistical algorithms, the accuracy of results depends on the size of the corpus used. In our approach, we first use a similar approach to word-align an English-Hindi parallel corpus. The English sentences are tagged </context>
