ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999944722222222">
The results of an international Delphi poll on
information linguistics which was carried out
between 1982 and 1983 are presented.
As part of conceptual work being done in
information science at the University of Constance
an international Delphi poll was carried out from
1982 to 1983 with the aim of establishing a
mid-term prognosis for the development of
&amp;quot;information linguistics&amp;quot;. The term &amp;quot;information
linguistics&amp;quot; refers to a scientific discipline
combining the fields of linguistic data processing,
applied computer science, linguistics, artificial
intelligence, and information science. A Delphi
poll is a written poll of experts - carried out in
this case in two phases. The results of the first
round were incorporated into the second round, so
that participants in the poll could react to the
trends as they took shape.

<bodyText confidence="0.997472481481482">
Based on sophisticated selection procedures 385
international experts in the field of information
linguistics were determined and were sent
questionnaires in the first round (April
1982). 90 questionnaires were returned. In the
second round 360 questionnaires were mailed
out (January 1963) and 56 were returned, 48 of
these from experts who had answered in the first
round. The last questionnaires were accepted at the
end of June 1983.
Overlapping data in the two rounds

In the following we refer to four sets of data:
Set _A 90 from round 1
Set B 48 from round 1 with answers in round 2
Set-C 56 from round 2
Set-b 48 from round 2 with answers in round 1
But we shall concentrate primarily on Set C because
- according to the Delphi philosophy - the data of
the second round are the most relevant. There
were 8 persons within Set _C who did not answer in
the first round. But they also were aware of
the results of the first round; therefore a
Delphi effect was possible. (In the following the
whole integers refer to absolute numbers; the
decimal figures to relative/procentual numbers)

Since Delphi polls are concerned with future
developments, it has been claimed in the past that
the age and experience of people in the field
influence the rating. In this paper, however, we
cannot prove this hypothesis. Here are the mere
statistical facts, only taken from Set _C (they do
not differ significantly in the other sets)

FID/ID, and on long discussions with Don Walker,
Hans Karlgren, and Udo Hahn. Altogether, there

3.2 Desirability (=DE)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998900125">
With respect to the application oriented subject
areas the category of desirability was used in
order to determine the social desirability
according to the following 4-point scale: &amp;quot;very
desirable&amp;quot;/++ (will have a positive social effect,
little or no negative social effect, extremely
beneficial), &amp;quot;desirable&amp;quot;/+ (in general positive,
minor negative social effects), &amp;quot;undesirable&amp;quot;!-
(negative social effect, socially harmful), &amp;quot;very
undesirable&amp;quot;/-- (major negative social effect,
socially not justifiable).
Tab.9 (data from Set C) shows that the nega-
tive parameters (--, -) were never or only seldom
used. Information linguistics is not judged -
according to the estimation of tne experts - as a
socially harmful scientific discipline.

<listItem confidence="0.378743">
4. Answer parameters for the single topics
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9980395">
The following parameters were used as ratings for
the sub-areas and the single topics. Their
definitions were given in more detail in the
questionnaire.

These categories of scientific importance,
feasibility, and date of realization were to be
judged from two points of view:
research(=R) - defined as: basic groundwork, mainly
of theoretical interest
application/development (=A) - defined as: mainly
of interest for working systems, applicable to
routine tasks
Therefore every single topic was evaluated accord-
ing to six parameters:
Importance for research I/R
Importance for application I/A
Feasibility for research F/R
Feasibility for application A/A
Date of realization considering research DR/R
Date of realization considering application DR/A

<bodyText confidence="0.999484909090909">
Competence was an important influence on evalua-
tion. In general one can say that people
with &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; competence (or more correctly: with
competence estimation of &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;) in a sub-area
gave topics higher ratings for importance and
feasibility both from the research and the
application points of view. Nevertheless, there
were differences. Those with &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; competence
differed more widely in evaluations of
research-oriented topics than in applica-
tion-oriented topics, whereas those with &amp;quot;super-
ficial&amp;quot; competence in the sub-areas were closer to
the average in their evaluations of applica-
tion-oriented topics than of research-oriented
topics. Here are some examples of the differences
(as reflected in the averages of the sub-areas).
Tab. 11 is to be read as follows: (line 1) in the
sub-area &amp;quot;Acoustic&amp;quot; those with &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; competence
evaluated 5.6% higher than the average with respect
to importance for research, whereas people with
&amp;quot;superficial&amp;quot; competence in the same sub-area
evaluated 6.9% lower than average.

As can be seen in the column FIR, sometimes the
general trend is reversed (Semantic: values from
&amp;quot;competent&amp;quot; participants are lower than from par-
ticipants with &amp;quot;superficial&amp;quot; competence).

There is also a connection between desirability and
the values of importance and feasibility. Those who
gave high ratings for desirability (DE++) in
general gave higher values to the single topics in
the respective sub-areas, both in comparison to
the average values and to the values of those who
gave only high desirability (DE+) to a given
sub-area. The differences between DE++ and DE+ are
even higher than those between C/g und C/s. Only
the F/R data in the translation and retrieval areas
are lower for D++ than for D+, in all other cases
the D++ values are higher. Some examples:

The average values in Tab. 13 and 14 should not
be over-interpreted. In particular, ranking is
unjustified. One cannot simply conclude that,
say, the sub-area &amp;quot;Semantics&amp;quot; (92.6) is more
important than that of &amp;quot;Abstracting&amp;quot; (75.6) with
respect to research because the average value
is higher; or that Indexing (79.2) is more
feasible from an application point of view
than Abstracting (52.3). Such conclusions may be
true, and this is why the values in Tab. 13 and
14 are given, but the parameters should actually
only be applied to the single topics in the
sub-areas. Cross-group ranking is not allowed
for methodological reasons.
But nevertheless the data are interesting enough.
It is obvious that the following relation is in
general true:
I/R (-values) &gt; I/A &gt; F/R &gt; F/A
There are some exceptions to this general rule,
such as Re-I/A&gt;I/R (both in Set A and Set C);
HA-F/RWR (in Set C); (Re-F/R aha F/A)&gt;I/R
Set C); and Il-F/R&gt;T/R(both in Set _A and Set C).
There seems to be a non-trivial gap between impor-
tance and feasibility (both with respect to
research and application). In other words, there
are more problems than solutions. And there is an
even broader gap between application and research.
From a practical point of view there is some skep-
sis concerning the possibility of solving important
research problems. And what seems to be feasible
from a research point of view looks different from
an application one.
The values in the second round are in general
higher than in the first one. This is an argument
against the oft cited Delphi hypothesis that the
feedback-mechanism - i.e. that the data of the
previous round are made known at the start of the
following round - has an averaging effect. The
increase-effect can probably be explained by the
fact that the percentage of qualified and &amp;quot;com-
petent&amp;quot; people was higher in the second round
(perhaps these were the ones who were motivated to
take on the burden of a second round) - and, as
Tab.11 shows, people who rated themselves &amp;quot;com-
petent&amp;quot; tend to evaluate higher.
Between the two rounds the decline in the
sub-areas &amp;quot;Software&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Hardware&amp;quot; (apart from the
parameter F/R) is striking. There is an overall
increase for &amp;quot;Morphology&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Information Lan-
guages&amp;quot; for all parameters, and a dramatic increase
for the topics in &amp;quot;Indexing&amp;quot; for F/R (9.7%), and a
dramatic decline for the &amp;quot;Translation&amp;quot;- and &amp;quot;Ques-
tion-Answering&amp;quot;-topics for the parameter F/A (9.8
and 8.4%).
The dates of realization do not change dramati-
cally. On the average there is a difference of one
year (and this makes sense becAuse there was almost
one year between round 1 and 2). There is a ten,
dency from a research point of view for the expec-
tation of realization to be somewhat earlier from
an application standpoint. But the differences are
not so dramatic as to justify the conclusion that
researchers are more optimistic than
developers/practitioners.

Finally I would like to thank all those who par-
ticipated in the Delphi rounds. It was an extremely
time-consuming task to answer the questionnaire,
which was more like a book than a folder. I hope
the results justify the efforts. The analysis would
not have been possible without the help of my
colleagues - Udo Hahn for the conceptual design,
and Dr.J.Staud together with Annette Woehrle, Frank
Dittmar and Gerhard Schneider for the statistical

<abstract confidence="0.995918191358025">The results of an international Delphi poll on information linguistics which was carried out between 1982 and 1983 are presented. As part of conceptual work being done in information science at the University of Constance an international Delphi poll was carried out from 1982 to 1983 with the aim of establishing a mid-term prognosis for the development of &amp;quot;information linguistics&amp;quot;. The term &amp;quot;information linguistics&amp;quot; refers to a scientific discipline combining the fields of linguistic data processing, applied computer science, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and information science. A Delphi poll is a written poll of experts carried out in this case in two phases. The results of the first round were incorporated into the second round, so that participants in the poll could react to the trends as they took shape. demoscopic data rate Based on sophisticated selection procedures 385 international experts in the field of information linguistics were determined and were sent questionnaires in the first round (April 1982). 90 questionnaires were returned. In the second round 360 questionnaires were mailed out (January 1963) and 56 were returned, 48 of these from experts who had answered in the first round. The last questionnaires were accepted at the end of June 1983. Overlapping data in the two rounds first round (90) second round (56) 2 48 8 In the following we refer to four sets of data: 90 from round 1 Set B 48 from round 1 with answers in round 2 56 from round 2 48 from round 2 with answers in round 1 But we shall concentrate primarily on Set C because according to the Delphi philosophy of the second round are the most relevant. There 8 persons within Set who did not answer in the first round. But they also were aware of the results of the first round; therefore a Delphi effect was possible. (In the following the whole integers refer to absolute numbers; the decimal figures to relative/procentual numbers) according to academic degree The survey singled out highly competent people, as in academic degree( data from A and of participants Set _A Set _C 25.6 28.6 M.S./M.A./Dipl. 40 44.4 28 50.0 62 37 Professor 14 15.6 15 26.8 Since Delphi polls are concerned with future developments, it has been claimed in the past that the age and experience of people in the field influence the rating.

<abstract confidence="0.962692123076923">5. More detailed results important influence on evaluation. In general one can say that people with &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; competence (or more correctly: with competence estimation of &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;) in a sub-area gave topics higher ratings for importance and feasibility both from the research and the application points of view. Nevertheless, there were differences. Those with &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; competence differed more widely in evaluations of research-oriented topics than in applicatopics, whereas those with &amp;quot;superficial&amp;quot; competence in the sub-areas were closer to the average in their evaluations of application-oriented topics than of research-oriented topics. Here are some examples of the differences (as reflected in the averages of the sub-areas). Tab. 11 is to be read as follows: (line 1) in the sub-area &amp;quot;Acoustic&amp;quot; those with &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; competence evaluated 5.6% higher than the average with respect to importance for research, whereas people with &amp;quot;superficial&amp;quot; competence in the same sub-area evaluated 6.9% lower than average. differences (g=good;s=superficial) I/R I/A F/R F/A CO/g CO/s CO/g CO/s CO/g CO/s CO/g CO/s Ac5.6+ 3.0- In4.7+ 5.1- Ac25.1+ 3.9- Ac9.4+ 0.6- Ha1.8+ 9.3- Ab4.3+ 13.8- Se1.1- 5.8+ Ha7.5+ 7.0- 1n5.4+ 19.8- In6.2+ 19.4- 1n5.0+ 19.4- 8.4- As can be seen in the column FIR, sometimes the general trend is reversed (Semantic: values from &amp;quot;competent&amp;quot; participants are lower than from participants with &amp;quot;superficial&amp;quot; competence). There is also a connection between desirability and the values of importance and feasibility. Those who gave high ratings for desirability (DE++) in general gave higher values to the single topics in the respective sub-areas, both in comparison to the average values and to the values of those who gave only high desirability (DE+) to a given sub-area. The differences between DE++ and DE+ are even higher than those between C/g und C/s. Only the F/R data in the translation and retrieval areas are lower for D++ than for D+, in all other cases the D++ values are higher. Some examples: differences I/R DE+ I/A DE++ DE+ F/R DE++ DP* F/A DE++ DE+ DE++ In 6.6+ 4.3- 4.5+ 4.9- 6.9+ 10.9- 11.4+ 15.3- Ab 6.8+ 0.6- 15.2+ 5.8- 0.9+ 0.2+ 7.9+ 4.3- Tr 2.8+ 5.9- 0.4+ 1.1- 2.1- 8.3+ 2.9+ 3.2- Re 1.9+ 8.3- 0.1+ - 0.2- 0.6+ 2.0+ 4.1- Qu 4.0+ 8.1- 7.5+14.2- 3.8+ 11.4- 7.7+ 23.5- Feasibility, Date of Realization (In the following tables the values of the answers ++ (very important, definitely feasible) and + (important, possibly feasible) have been added 543 together, and the values from the single topics have been averaged.

<abstract confidence="0.960884604166667">The average values in Tab. 13 and 14 should not be over-interpreted. In particular, ranking is unjustified. One cannot simply conclude that, say, the sub-area &amp;quot;Semantics&amp;quot; (92.6) is more important than that of &amp;quot;Abstracting&amp;quot; (75.6) with respect to research because the average value is higher; or that Indexing (79.2) is more feasible from an application point of view than Abstracting (52.3). Such conclusions may be true, and this is why the values in Tab. 13 and 14 are given, but the parameters should actually only be applied to the single topics in the sub-areas. Cross-group ranking is not allowed for methodological reasons. But nevertheless the data are interesting enough. It is obvious that the following relation is in general true: I/R (-values) &gt; I/A &gt; F/R &gt; F/A There are some exceptions to this general rule, such as Re-I/A&gt;I/R (both in Set A and Set C); HA-F/RWR (in Set C); (Re-F/R aha F/A)&gt;I/R C); and Il-F/R&gt;T/R(both in Set and Set C). There seems to be a non-trivial gap between importance and feasibility (both with respect to research and application). In other words, there are more problems than solutions. And there is an even broader gap between application and research. From a practical point of view there is some skepsis concerning the possibility of solving important research problems. And what seems to be feasible from a research point of view looks different from an application one. The values in the second round are in general higher than in the first one. This is an argument against the oft cited Delphi hypothesis that the feedback-mechanism i.e. that the data of the previous round are made known at the start of the following round has an averaging effect. The increase-effect can probably be explained by the fact that the percentage of qualified and &amp;quot;competent&amp;quot; people was higher in the second round (perhaps these were the ones who were motivated to take on the burden of a second round) and, as Tab.11 shows, people who rated themselves &amp;quot;competent&amp;quot; tend to evaluate higher. Between the two rounds the decline in the sub-areas &amp;quot;Software&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Hardware&amp;quot; (apart from the parameter F/R) is striking. There is an overall increase for &amp;quot;Morphology&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Information Languages&amp;quot; for all parameters, and a dramatic increase for the topics in &amp;quot;Indexing&amp;quot; for F/R (9.7%), and a dramatic decline for the &amp;quot;Translation&amp;quot;and &amp;quot;Question-Answering&amp;quot;-topics for the parameter F/A (9.8 and 8.4%). The dates of realization do not change dramatithe average there is a difference of one this makes sense becAuse there was almost one year between round 1 and 2). There is a ten, dency from a research point of view for the expectation of realization to be somewhat earlier from an application standpoint. But the differences are not so dramatic as to justify the conclusion that researchers are more optimistic than developers/practitioners. topics Tab.15 and 16 show the two highest rated topics in each Ubaea in the first two columns and the two lowest rated topics in each sub-area in the last two columns. These represent average data from Set C. The four columns in the middle show the estimation of participants who work in research or application, respectively. As part of the demoscopic data it was determined whether participants work more in research or in application (cf. Tab.6). Notice that both groups answered from a research and application point of view. In a more detailed analysis (which will be published later) this and other aspects can be pursued. In and the data for very high importance and high importance (+) have been together. 544 according to importance most important topics (++&amp;quot;+) less important average research application average(--.)

It was an extremely time-consuming task to answer the questionnaire, which was more like a book than a folder. I hope the results justify the efforts. The analysis would not have been possible without the help of my colleagues - Udo Hahn for the conceptual design, and Dr.J.Staud together with Annette Woehrle, Frank and Gerhard Schneider for the analysis.
