This article describes the combination of a
SYSTRAN system with a “statistical post-
editing” (SPE) system. We document
qualitative analysis on two experiments

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999845446428572">
The evolution of SYSTRAN’s architecture over
the last years has been to « open » the system to
enable interaction between the internal system’s
rules and the external input – see Senellart (2003),
Attnas et al. (2005). Based on this architecture,
several directions are explored to introduce the use
of « corpus-based » approaches at several levels of
the process:
- use of corpus-based tools to validate and enrich
linguistic resources (detection of forbidden se-
quences, bilingual terminology extraction), - auto-
matic recognition of the text domain, - use of a
corpus-based decision mechanism within « word
boundary » (Chinese word identification), disam-
biguation... - use of word sense disambiguation
techniques – and the use of a language model in
the generation phase to select alternative transla-
tions, prepositions, and local reordering (adjective
positioning).
These tools have been presented in Senellart
(2006) and most of them will be integrated in
SYSTRAN version 7 systems.
Independently, two experiments were carried
out for the shared task of the ACL 2007 Workshop
on Statistical Machine Translation to combine a
raw SYSTRAN system with a statistical post-
editing (SPE) system. One experiment was run by
NRC using the language pair English&lt;&gt;French in
the context of « Automatic Post-Edition » systems
using the PORTAGE system as described in Si-
mard et al. (2007). The second experiment based
on the same principle was run on the Ger-
man&gt;English and Spanish&gt;English1 language pairs
using the Moses system (Koehn et al. 2007). The
objective was to train a SMT system on a parallel
corpus composed of SYSTRAN translations with
the referenced source aligned with its referenced
translation.
Beyond both (a) the huge (and expected) im-
provement of the BLEU score for the combined
system compared to raw translation output (for
German-English, around 10 BLEU points for the
Europarl test set of WMT2007) and (b) the (ex-
pected) corresponding improvement of the transla-
tion fluency, we provide qualitative analysis on the
contributions (positive and negative) of the SPE
layer imposed on the SYSTRAN translation output
in this paper. For this analysis we classifiy the dif-
ferent types of “post-editing” changes and point
out the alternative isolated statistical components
that could achieve the same results.
We conclude with two possible approaches:
breaking down the “statistical layer” into different
components/tools each specialized in a narrow and
accurate area, or refining this global SPE approach
in order to introduce linguistic constraints.

2 The SYSTRAN System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999804444444444">
Covering 80 language pairs for 22 different source
languages, SYSTRAN powers almost all major
portals (Google, Yahoo!, BabelFish, Apple,
Worldlingo, ...) with machine translation services
through URL translations or translation “boxes”
(estimated traffic: over 40 million sentence transla-
tions and over 10 million web page translations per
day).
Customized systems are used by corporate custom-
ers either within a post-editing workflow, or with-
out post-editing for the translation of technical
Knowledge Bases.
SYSTRAN engines are also available as desktop
applications through “plugins” or within post-
editing tools. The same engines are also available
on ultra-light architectures such as for PDA de-
vices.
The SYSTRAN system is traditionally classi-
fied as a “rule-based” system and its design –
which has been in constant evolution - has, over
the years, always been driven by pragmatic consid-
erations – progressively integrating most of the
available productive techniques. As such, it is dif-
ficult to classify SYSTRAN and simply describe
its architecture. However, the evolution of the
SYSTRAN system is governed by the following
principles:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.776514">
• provide a deterministic output : it is possi-
ble to easily explain the translation results
for a specific sentence and change the rule
• incremental translation quality: the more
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.913634230769231">
important evaluation criterion for mature
systems is to perform a comparative evalua-
tion of translation output between two con-
secutive versions. Since it is impossible to
guarantee 0 regressions in linguistic devel-
opment, 8 improvements for 1 degradation
defines the acceptance criterion for a lin-
guistic patch.
Crucial components of the SYSTRAN system
are the linguistic resources for each lan-
guage/language pair ranging from 100k to 800k
entries. Such “entries” should be understood as
both simple or multiword “lexical entries” but also
as customized disambiguation rules.
In this context (continuous integration of new
techniques in SYSTRAN engines, adhering to de-
terminism and incrementability), over the last three
years one major evolution within SYSTRAN has
been to make use of available corpora - statically
through extraction/learning/validation tools such as:
• Dictionary improvement using a monolin-
gual corpus: new terms/entities/terminology
extraction (n-grams based on linguistic pat-
terns);
and dynamically through corpus-based decision
algorithms such as:

tive translations, determiner choice, and lo-
cal controlled reordering – like multiple ad-
jective sequences.
In the following section, we present a qualitative
review of the SYSTRAN+SPE output and analyze
how the different contributions relate to each spe-
cific effort.

Based on the data from these two experiments:
SYSTRAN+PORTAGE (En&lt;&gt;Fr), and
SYSTRAN+Moses (De&gt;En, Es&gt;En), we
performed linguistic evaluations on the differences
between raw SYSTRAN output and
SYSTRAN+SPE output. The evaluation for
En&lt;&gt;Fr was performed on the News Commentary
test 2006 corpus, while the evaluations for De&gt;En,
and Es&gt;En were performed on the Europarl test
2007 corpus.

The first observation is the impact of the SPE on
the SYSTRAN output. Table 1 displays the WCR
(Word Change Rate2) and the ratio of sentences
impacted by the statistical post-editing. It is inter-
esting to note that the impact is quite high since
almost all sentences were post-edited. On the other
hand, the WCR of SYSTRAN+SPE is relatively
small – as this clearly relates to post-editing and
not a complete reshuffling of the translation. The
same insight is reinforced when reviewing a com-
parator (see Table 2) – the SYSTRAN+SPE output

3.2 Linguistic Categorization of Different
Post-Editing Changes

<bodyText confidence="0.995608">
To classify the types of “post-editing” changes
brought by the SPE system, we define the follow-
ing criteria:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.839952305555555">
• termchg – changes related to lexical changes.
o termchg_nfw – word not translated by SYSTRAN
generating a translation with SPE.
o termchg_term – slight terminology change pre-
serves part of speech and meaning. Most of the time
changes improve fluency by selecting the appropriate
terminology. (e.g. politicians-+politiciens vs. the more
commonly used “hommes politiques”).
o termchg_loc – multiword expression/locution
change (the same is true-+Le même est vrai vs. C’est
également vrai)
o termchg_mean – lexical modification altering the
meaning of the sentences, by changing the part of
speech of the word, or by selecting a completely differ-
ent meaning for a given word. (Despite occasional
grumbles-+En dépit des grognements occasionnels vs.
En dépit des maux économiser)
• gram – changes related to grammar
o gram_det – change in determiner (on political com-
mitments-+sur des engagements politiques vs. sur les
engagements politiques)
o gram_prep – change in preposition (across the
Atlantic-+à travers l’atlantique vs. de l’autre côté de
l’atlantique)
o gram_pron – change in pronoun
o gram_tense – change in tense (should not be hid-
den- ne devraient... vs. ne doivent...)
o gram_number/gram_gender – change in num-
ber/gender – often reflecting lack of agreement
o gram_other – other grammatical changes
• punct/digit/case – change in punctuation, case, or
numbers
• wordorder_local – change in local word order
• wordorder_long – change in word order (long distance)
• style – change in “style” (justifying-+justifiant vs. ce qui
justifie)

3.3 Analysis of Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987182137931034">
The figures from the previous section provide very
useful information that requires deeper analysis,
the most obvious of which follow:
• As is, this basic integration does not meet
the acceptance criterion “8 improv. for 1 de-
grad.”
• The most improved category is the
“termchg” which corresponds to a local
choice of word sense or alternative
translation of words and locutions. In this
category, the main source degradation stems
from the “termchg_mean” category. This
category covers changes of lexical unit parts
of speech.
• In grammatical categories, productive
categories are “gram_det” and “gram_prep”
but the improvement/degradation ratio for
this last category is very low (it shows
global improvements but there are many
unacceptable degradations).
• As expected, no “long-distance” restruc-
turing is observed and local reordering is
negative for En&gt;Fr and relatively negligible
for other language pairs.
• For the French target, morphology is a ma-
jor issue (accounts for 25% of degradations).
This was also expected since no mechanism
in the SPE provides any control over the
morphology.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993428">
The SYSTRAN+SPE experiments demonstrate
very good results – both on automatic scoring and
on linguistic analysis. Detailed comparative analy-
sis provides directions on how to further improve
these results by adding “linguistic control” mecha-
nisms. For SPE, we would, for instance, add lin-
guistic constraints in the decoding process, know-
ing that the structure/linguistic information could
be made available in the translation output.
Beyond the scope of these experiments, our re-
sults set a baseline to compare with other more
sophisticated/integrated “rules and statistics” com-
bination models.
In particular, the most improved categories ob-
served in these experiments confirm that our cur-
rent development direction for integrating data-
driven mechanisms within translation engines (es-
pecially for word sense disambiguation, for the
selection of alternative translations or for specific
local phenomena like determination) should con-
verge on the same results while preventing associ-
ated degradations. Also, the high score reached by
the “termchg_loc” category substantiates the need
to continue exploiting phrase tables built on
parallel corpora to learn new terminology.
