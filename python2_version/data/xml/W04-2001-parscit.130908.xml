Robustness in Computational Linguistics has been recently recognized as a central issue for the
design of interactive applications based on natural language communication. If a failure of the
system can be acceptable in batch applications requiring a human intervention, an on-line system
should be capable of dealing with unforeseen situations in a more flexible way. When we talk about
system failure we do not think at inherent program failures like infinite loops or system exception,
we consider, rather, failures related to the processing of the input and its assimilation in the system&apos;s
knowledge base. A failure of this kind means simply that the system does not &amp;quot;understand&amp;quot; the
input. The automated analysis of natural language data has become a central issue in the design of
Intelligent Information Systems. Processing unconstrained natural language data is still considered
an AI-hard task. However, various analysis techniques have been proposed in order to address
specific aspects of natural language. In particular, recent interest has been focused on providing
approximate analysis techniques, assuming that when perfect analysis is not possible, partial results
may be still very useful.
Interpretation of natural language data is a subjective cognitive process. Its formalisation could be
either a straightforward or a hard task, depending on the perspective taken. The human ability to
interpret language is the result of thousands of years of evolution and cultural development. We, as
humans, are capable of mapping surface language forms into meaning representations, but we can
only observe the final result of this process without exactly knowing what happens in our brain. In
contrast, we can model understanding in an abstract domain where the process of reaching the
meaning is decomposed at least in two parts. We are interested in establishing to what degree:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997712">
• the mapping is sound (i.e. if the competence model enables us to extract correct meanings);
• the mapping is complete (i.e. if the competence model enables us to deal with all the
language phenomena).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997400052631579">
These two measures are fairly general, but in specific applications they might correspond to the
classic evaluation metrics of Information Retrieval (i.e. precision and recall).
Even human interpretation of language is not infallible. For instance, in areas where people lack
context, or have different views on the context, people can fail to understand each other and can
have different opinions on utterances&apos; interpretation. Apparently, it is always possible to provide an
interpretation of any kind of data. Actually, one not always provides the right or the best
interpretation among the possible ones. This happens for humans and, why not, for artificial
systems. When switching to artificial systems, what is worth considering is the human ability to
provide different degrees of approximate interpretations, ranging from the full understanding to the
complete ignorance. In addition, humans are able to overcome their limitations by their learning
capabilities. In the interpretation process, the lack of knowledge, the uncertainty, vagueness,
ambiguity, and misconception should be explicitly represented and considered at a meta-level in
order to handle linguistic applications &apos;robustly&apos;.
There are many ways in which the topic of robustness may be tackled: as a competency problem, as
a problem of achieving interesting partial results, as a shallow analysis method, etc. What these
approaches have in common is that the simple (rigid) combination of &apos;complete&apos; analysis modules at
different linguistic levels does not guarantees the system&apos;s robustness. Rather, robustness must be
considered as a system-wide concern. We believe that the problem of robustness in NLP may be
tackled by adopting the following two complementary approaches:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98577275">
1. as an engineering `add-on&apos;: completing an existing system with additional features in order
to overcome the problem of its inability to cope with real-world data;
2. as a basic element of the underlying language theories: extending them by assuming that the
understanding of the domain can be incomplete.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999682608695652">
Both approaches may be effective under certain circumstances. We thus propose to consider two
different perspectives on the role of robustness in software architectures for natural language
processing and understanding, namely: robustness &amp;quot;in the small&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;in the large&amp;quot;.
With Robustness &amp;quot;in the small&amp;quot; we mean the robustness in language analysis is achieved at the
individual linguistic levels, such as the morpho-syntactic analysis, semantic interpretation,
conversational analysis, dialogue acts recognition, anaphora resolution, and discourse analysis.
With Robustness &amp;quot;in the large&amp;quot; we mean the robustness achieved in integrated NLP/NLU
architectures possibly implementing hybrid approaches to language analysis, and incorporating the
different methods into a competitive/cooperative system.
ROMAND 2004 is the third of a series of workshops aimed at bringing together researchers that
work in fields like artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, human-computer interaction,
cognitive science and are interested in robust methods in natural language processing and
understanding. Theoretical aspects of robustness in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Understanding (NLU) are concerned by the workshop’s theme, as well as engineering and industrial
experiences.
This volume contains an extended abstract of the invited talk and 11 papers selected by peer review
out of 16 submissions. The accepted papers cover topics related to robust syntactic parsing, robust
semantic parsing and applications using robust analysis methods (semantic tagging, information
extraction, question answering, document clustering).
The third edition of ROMAND workshop features an exceptional invited speaker. Frank Keller
from Edinburgh University accepted to talk about robustness aspects in cognitive, computational
and stochastic models of human parsing surveying and discussing the weaknesses and strengths of
most recent advanced theories.
The papers dedicated to robust syntactic parsing methods cover topics as combinations of statistical
and deep-linguistic syntactic analysis, as well as a parser&apos;s evaluation. The paper proposed by G.
Schneider, J. Dowdall and F. Rinaldi, “A Robust and Hybrid Deep-Linguistic Theory Applied to
Large-Scale Parsing”, presents an efficient state-of-the-art hybrid parser combining statistical and
rule-based parsing as well as shallow and deep parsing using a combination of phrase-structure and
functional dependency grammars. The paper “Syntactic parser combination for improved
dependency analysis” describes how F. Brunet-Manquant improves parsing efficiency in building
complex dependency structures by combining the results of the three concurrent parsers: the
Incremental Finite-State Parser, the GREYC parser combining tagging methods to build non-
recursive chunks, and the Xerox Incremental Parser. A difficult problem of evaluation as well as the
evaluation of the GETARUNS system is proposed and discussed in Delmonte’s paper “Evaluating
GETARUNS Parser with GREVAL Test Suite”.
Robustness plays an important role in semantic interpretation. Semantic interpretations are
generated by robust syntactic parsers output in specific representation languages: as logical
formulae in Minimal Recursion Semantics or as semantic hypergraphs in Unified Network
Language respectively in the papers “A step towards incremental generation of logical forms” by L.
Coheur, N. Mamede, G. Bés, and “Using an incremental robust parser to automatically generate
semantic UNL graphs” by N. Gala. Existing knowledge bases (FrameNet and WordNet) are
exploited to build complex semantic structures directly from free texts, as proposed in “An
Algorithm for Open Text Semantic Parsing” by L. Shi and R. Mihalcea. J. Bryant in his paper
“Recovering Coherent Interpretations Using Semantic Integration of Partial Parses” presents a
robust semantic parser for Embodied Construction Grammars used to reconstruct full semantic
interpretations from semantic chunks in the framework of psycholinguistics studies on language
acquisition.
A direct use of robust analysis methods is featured by several Information Extraction applications:
Part of Speech tagging, building knoweldge maps from texts, Question-Answering, and document
clustering. Robust morphological analysis for POS and restricted semantic tagging in Bulgarian is
achieved by for learning robust ending guessing rules in the P. Nakov and E. Paskaleva’s paper
“Robust Ending Guessing Rules with Application to Slavonic Languages”. Extraction of
Associative Term Networks from texts including co-occurences of several content words sharing
similar contexts is the goal of the paper “Knowledge Extraction Using Dynamical Updating of
Representation” by A. Dragoni, L. Lella, G. Tascini, and W. Giordano. Answer Validation is an
important module of a Question-Answering system for which a method exploiting co-occurrence
frequencies of keywords extracted from Web documents is proposed in the paper “Answer
Validation by Keyword Association” by M. Tonoike, T. Utsuro, and S. Sato. Document clustering
algorithms could help the users for Web browsing, where several document representations are
compared (as POS or as WordNet synsets) and exploited by an efficient clustering algorithm
discussed in the paper “WordNet-based text document clustering” by J. Sedding and D. Kazakov.
We believe that the output of the ROMAND 2004 workshop will contribute to a better
understanding of various aspects of robust analysis in Natural Language Processing and
Understanding by presenting relevant advances in morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and
evaluation, as well as examples of large-scale Information-Extraction applications relying on robust
NLP/NLU techniques and architectures.
