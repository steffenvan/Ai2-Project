Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999906875">
The “Affective Text” task focuses on the
classification of emotions and valence (pos-
itive/negative polarity) in news headlines,
and is meant as an exploration of the connec-
tion between emotions and lexical seman-
tics. In this paper, we describe the data set
used in the evaluation and the results ob-
tained by the participating systems.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999210956521739">
All words can potentially convey affective mean-
ing. Every word, even those apparently neutral, can
evoke pleasant or painful experiences due to their
semantic relation with emotional concepts or cate-
gories. Some words have emotional meaning with
respect to an individual story, while for many others
the affective power is part of the collective imagina-
tion (e.g., words such as “mum”, “ghost”, “war”).
The automatic detection of emotion in texts is
becoming increasingly important from an applica-
tive point of view. Consider for example the tasks
of opinion mining and market analysis, affective
computing, or natural language interfaces such as
e-learning environments or educational/edutainment
games. Possible beneficial effects of emotions on
memory and attention of the users, and in general on
fostering their creativity are also well-known in the
field of psychology.
For instance, the following represent examples
of applicative scenarios in which affective analysis
would give valuable and interesting contributions:
Sentiment Analysis. Text categorization according
to affective relevance, opinion exploration for

market analysis, etc. are just some exam-
ples of application of these techniques. While
positive/negative valence annotation is an ac-
tive field of sentiment analysis, we believe that
a fine-grained emotion annotation would in-
crease the effectiveness of these applications.
Computer Assisted Creativity. The automated
generation of evaluative expressions with
a bias on some polarity orientation are a
key component for automatic personalized
advertisement and persuasive communication.
The “Affective Text” task was intended as an ex-
ploration of the connection between lexical seman-
tics and emotions, and an evaluation of various au-
tomatic approaches to emotion recognition.
The task is not easy. Indeed, as (Ortony et
al., 1987) indicates, besides words directly refer-
ring to emotional states (e.g., “fear”, “cheerful”) and
for which an appropriate lexicon would help, there
are words that act only as an indirect reference to
Verbal Expressivity in Human Computer Interaction.
Future human-computer interaction, accord-
ing to a widespread view, will emphasize
naturalness and effectiveness and hence the
incorporation of models of possibly many hu-
man cognitive capabilities, including affective
analysis and generation. For example, emo-
tion expression by synthetic characters (e.g.,
embodied conversational agents) is considered
now a key element for their believability.
Affective words selection and understanding is
crucial for realizing appropriate and expressive
conversations.

“ghost”). We can call the former direct affective
words and the latter indirect affective words (Strap-
parava et al., 2006).

2 Task Definition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999682447368421">
We proposed to focus on the emotion classification
of news headlines extracted from news web sites.
Headlines typically consist of a few words and are
often written by creative people with the intention
to “provoke” emotions, and consequently to attract
the readers’ attention. These characteristics make
this type of text particularly suitable for use in an
automatic emotion recognition setting, as the affec-
tive/emotional features (if present) are guaranteed to
appear in these short sentences.
The structure of the task was as follows:
Corpus: News titles, extracted from news web sites
(such as Google news, CNN) and/or newspa-
pers. In the case of web sites, we can easily
collect a few thousand titles in a short amount
of time.
Objective: Provided a set of predefined six emotion
labels (i.e., Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness,
Surprise), classify the titles with the appropri-
ate emotion label and/or with a valence indica-
tion (positive/negative).
The emotion labeling and valence classification
were seen as independent tasks, and thus a team was
able to participate in one or both tasks. The task
was carried out in an unsupervised setting, and con-
sequently no training was provided. The reason be-
hind this decision is that we wanted to emphasize the
study of emotion lexical semantics, and avoid bias-
ing the participants toward simple “text categoriza-
tion” approaches. Nonetheless supervised systems
were not precluded from participation, and in such
cases the teams were allowed to create their own su-
pervised training sets.
Participants were free to use any resources they
wanted. We provided a set words extracted from
WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004),
relevant to the six emotions of interest. However,
the use of this list was entirely optional.

2.1 Data Set
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881571428571">
The data set consisted of news headlines drawn from
major newspapers such as New York Times, CNN,
and BBC News, as well as from the Google News
search engine. We decided to focus our attention on
headlines for two main reasons. First, news have
typically a high load of emotional content, as they
describe major national or worldwide events, and are
written in a style meant to attract the attention of the
readers. Second, the structure of headlines was ap-
propriate for our goal of conducting sentence-level
annotations of emotions.
Two data sets were made available: a develop-
ment data set consisting of 250 annotated headlines,
and a test data set with 1,000 annotated headlines.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996265">
2.2 Data Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918206896551">
To perform the annotations, we developed a Web-
based annotation interface that displayed one head-
line at a time, together with six slide bars for emo-
tions and one slide bar for valence. The interval for
the emotion annotations was set to [0, 100], where 0
means the emotion is missing from the given head-
line, and 100 represents maximum emotional load.
The interval for the valence annotations was set to
[−100,100], where 0 represents a neutral headline,
−100 represents a highly negative headline, and 100
corresponds to a highly positive headline.
Unlike previous annotations of sentiment or sub-
jectivity (Wiebe et al., 2005; Pang and Lee, 2004),
which typically relied on binary 0/1 annotations, we
decided to use a finer-grained scale, hence allow-
ing the annotators to select different degrees of emo-
tional load.
The test data set was independently labeled by six
annotators. The annotators were instructed to select
the appropriate emotions for each headline based on
the presence of words or phrases with emotional
content, as well as the overall feeling invoked by
the headline. Annotation examples were also pro-
vided, including examples of headlines bearing two
or more emotions to illustrate the case where sev-
eral emotions were jointly applicable. Finally, the
annotators were encouraged to follow their “first in-
tuition,” and to use the full-range of the annotation
scale bars.

2.3 Inter-Annotator Agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918555555556">
We conducted inter-tagger agreement studies for
each of the six emotions and for the valence an-
notations. The agreement evaluations were carried
out using the Pearson correlation measure, and are
shown in Table 1. To measure the agreement among
the six annotators, we first measured the agreement
between each annotator and the average of the re-
maining five annotators, followed by an average
over the six resulting agreement figures.

2.4 Fine-grained and Coarse-grained
Evaluations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999784875">
Fine-grained evaluations were conducted using the
Pearson measure of correlation between the system
scores and the gold standard scores, averaged over
all the headlines in the data set.
We have also run a coarse-grained evaluation,
where each emotion was mapped to a 0/1 classifica-
tion (0 = [0,50), 1 = [50,100]), and each valence was
mapped to a -1/0/1 classification (-1 = [-100,-50],
0 = (-50,50), 1 = [50,100]). For the coarse-grained
evaluations, we calculated accuracy, precision, and
recall. Note that the accuracy is calculated with re-
spect to all the possible classes, and thus it can be
artificially high in the case of unbalanced datasets
(as some of the emotions are, due to the high num-
ber of neutral headlines). Instead, the precision and
recall figures exclude the neutral annotations.

3 Participating Systems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961846153846">
Five teams have participated in the task, with five
systems for valence classification and three systems
for emotion labeling. The following represents a
short description of the systems.
UPAR7: This is a rule-based system using a lin-
guistic approach. A first pass through the data “un-
capitalizes” common words in the news title. The
system then used the Stanford syntactic parser on
the modified title, and tried to identify what is being
said about the main subject by exploiting the depen-
dency graph obtained from the parser.
Each word was first rated separately for each emo-
tion (the six emotions plus Compassion) and for va-
lence. Next, the main subject rating was boosted.
Contrasts and accentuations between “good” or
“bad” were detected, making it possible to identify
surprising good or bad news. The system also takes
into account: human will (as opposed to illness or
natural disasters); negation and modals; high-tech
context; celebrities.
The lexical resource used was a combination
of SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) and
WordNetAffect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004),
which were semi-automatically enriched on the ba-
sis of the original trial data.
SICS: The SICS team used a very simple ap-
proach for valence annotation based on a word-space
model and a set of seed words. The idea was to cre-
ate two points in a high-dimensional word space -
one representing positive valence, the other repre-
senting negative valence - and then projecting each
headline into this space, choosing the valence whose
point was closer to the headline.
The word space was produced from a lemmatized
and stop list filtered version of the LA times cor-
pus (consisting of documents from 1994, released
for experimentation in the Cross Language Eval-
uation Forum (CLEF)) using documents as con-
texts and standard TFIDF weighting of frequencies.
No dimensionality reduction was used, resulting in
a 220,220-dimensional word space containing pre-
dominantly syntagmatic relations between words.
Valence vectors were created in this space by sum-
ming the context vectors of a set of manually se-
lected seed words (8 positive and 8 negative words).
For each headline in the test data, stop words and
words with frequency above 10,000 in the LA times
corpus were removed. The context vectors of the re-
maining words were then summed, and the cosine of
the angles between the summed vector and each of
the valence vectors were computed, and the head-
line was ascribed the valence value (computed as
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996062">
72
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987415625">
[cosine * 100 + 50]) of the closest valence vector
(headlines that were closer to the negative valence
vector were assigned a negative valence value). In
11 cases, a value of -0.0 was ascribed either because
no words were left in the headline after frequency
and stop word filtering, or because none of the re-
maining words occurred in the LA times corpus and
thus did not have any context vector.
CLaC: This team submitted two systems to the
competition: an unsupervised knowledge-based sys-
tem (ClaC) and a supervised corpus-based system
(CLaC-NB). Both systems were used for assigning
positive/negative and neutral valence to headlines on
the scale [-100,100].
CLaC: The CLaC system relies on a knowledge-
based domain-independent unsupervised approach
to headline valence detection and scoring. The
system uses three main kinds of knowledge: a
list of sentiment-bearing words, a list of valence
shifters and a set of rules that define the scope and
the result of the combination of sentiment-bearing
words and valence shifters. The unigrams used for
sentence/headline classification were learned from
WordNet dictionary entries. In order to take advan-
tage of the special properties of WordNet glosses
and relations, we developed a system that used the
list of human-annotated adjectives from (Hatzivas-
siloglou and McKeown, 1997) as a seed list and
learned additional unigrams from WordNet synsets
and glosses. The list was then expanded by adding
to it all the words annotated with Positive or Neg-
ative tags in the General Inquirer. Each unigram in
the resulting list had the degree of membership in the
category of positive or negative sentiment assigned
to it using the fuzzy Net Overlap Score method de-
scribed in the team’s earlier work (Andreevskaia and
Bergler, 2006). Only words with fuzzy member-
ship score not equal to zero were retained in the
list. The resulting list contained 10,809 sentiment-
bearing words of different parts of speech.
The fuzzy Net Overlap Score counts were com-
plemented with the capability to discern and take
into account some relevant elements of syntactic
structure of the sentences. Two components were
added to the system to enable this capability: (1)
valence shifter handling rules and (2) parse tree
analysis. The list of valence shifters was a com-
bination of a list of common English negations
and a subset of the list of automatically obtained
words with increase/decrease semantics, comple-
mented with manual annotation. The full list con-
sists of 450 words and expressions. Each entry in
the list of valence shifters has an action and scope
associated with it, which are used by special han-
dling rules that enable the system to identify such
words and phrases in the text and take them into ac-
count in sentence sentiment determination. In order
to correctly determine the scope of valence shifters
in a sentence, the system used a parse tree analysis
using MiniPar.
As a result of this processing, every headline re-
ceived a system score assigned based on the com-
bined fuzzy Net Overlap Score of its constituents.
This score was then mapped into the [-100 to 100]
scale as required by the task.
CLaC-NB: In order to assess the performance of
basic Machine Learning techniques on headlines,
a second system ClaC-NB was also implemented.
This system used a Naive Bayes classifier in order to
assign valence to headlines. It was trained on a small
corpus composed of the development corpus of 250
headlines provided for this competition, plus an ad-
ditional 200 headlines manually annotated and 400
positive and negative news sentences. The probabil-
ities assigned by the classifier were mapped to the [-
100, 100] scale as follows: all negative headlines re-
ceived the score of -100, all positive headlines were
assigned the score of +100, and the neutral headlines
obtained the score of 0.
UA: In order to determine the kind and the amount
of emotions in a headline, statistics were gathered
from three different web Search Engines: MyWay,
AlltheWeb and Yahoo. This information was used to
observe the distribution of the nouns, the verbs, the
adverbs and the adjectives extracted from the head-
line and the different emotions.
The emotion scores were obtained through Point-
wise Mutual Information (PMI). First, the number
of documents obtained from the three web search
engines using a query that contains all the headline
words and an emotion (the words occur in an inde-
pendent proximity across the web documents) was
divided by the number of documents containing only
an emotion and the number of documents containing
all the headline words. Second, an associative score
between each content word and an emotion was es-
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999722111111111">
timated and used to weight the final PMI score. The
obtained results were normalized in the 0-100 range.
SWAT: SWAT is a supervised system using an u-
nigram model trained to annotate emotional content.
Synonym expansion on the emotion label words was
also performed, using the Roget Thesaurus. In addi-
tion to the development data provided by the task
organizers, the SWAT team annotated an additional
set of 1000 headlines, which was used for training.

Tables 2 and 3 show the results obtained by the par-
ticipating systems. The tables show both the fine-
grained Pearson correlation measure and the coarse-
grained accuracy, precision and recall figures.
While further analysis is still needed, the results
indicate that the task of emotion annotation is diffi-
cult. Although the Pearson correlation for the inter-
tagger agreement is not particularly high, the gap
between the results obtained by the systems and the
upper bound represented by the annotator agreement
suggests that there is room for future improvements.

The system uses three main kinds of knowledge: a list of sentiment-bearing words, a list of valence shifters and a set of rules that define the scope and the result of the combination of sentiment-bearing words and valence shifters. The unigrams used for sentence/headline classification were learned from WordNet dictionary entries. In order to take advantage of the special properties of WordNet glosses and relations, we developed a system that used the list of human-annotated adjectives from (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) as a seed list and learned additional unigrams from WordNet synsets and glosses. The list was then expanded by adding to it all the words annotated with Positive or Negative tags in the General Inquirer. Each unigram in the resulting list had the degree of membership in the category of positive or negative sentiment assigned to it using the fuzzy Net Overlap Score method described in the team’s earlier work (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006). Only words with fuzzy membership score not equal to zero were retained in the list. The resulting list contained 10,809 sentimentbearing words of differen</context>

Computer Assisted Creativity. The automated generation of evaluative expressions with a bias on some polarity orientation are a key component for automatic personalized advertisement and persuasive communication. The “Affective Text” task was intended as an exploration of the connection between lexical semantics and emotions, and an evaluation of various automatic approaches to emotion recognition. The task is not easy. Indeed, as (Ortony et al., 1987) indicates, besides words directly referring to emotional states (e.g., “fear”, “cheerful”) and for which an appropriate lexicon would help, there are words that act only as an indirect reference to Verbal Expressivity in Human Computer Interaction. Future human-computer interaction, according to a widespread view, will emphasize naturalness and effectiveness and hence the incorporation of models of possibly many human cognitive capabilities, including affective analysis and generation. For example, emotion expression by synthetic characters (e.g., embodied conversational agents) is considered</context>

The task was carried out in an unsupervised setting, and consequently no training was provided. The reason behind this decision is that we wanted to emphasize the study of emotion lexical semantics, and avoid biasing the participants toward simple “text categorization” approaches. Nonetheless supervised systems were not precluded from participation, and in such cases the teams were allowed to create their own supervised training sets. Participants were free to use any resources they wanted. We provided a set words extracted from WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004), relevant to the six emotions of interest. However, the use of this list was entirely optional. 2.1 Data Set The data set consisted of news headlines drawn from major newspapers such as New York Times, CNN, and BBC News, as well as from the Google News search engine. We decided to focus our attention on headlines for two main reasons. First, news have typically a high load of emotional content, as they describe major national or worldwide events, and are written in a style meant to attract the attention of the readers. Second, the structure of headlines was appropriate for our goal of conduct</context>

Headlines typically consist of a few words and are often written by creative people with the intention to “provoke” emotions, and consequently to attract the readers’ attention. These characteristics make this type of text particularly suitable for use in an automatic emotion recognition setting, as the affective/emotional features (if present) are guaranteed to appear in these short sentences.
