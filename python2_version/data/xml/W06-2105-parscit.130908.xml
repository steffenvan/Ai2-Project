The proper interpretation of prepositions
is an important issue for automatic natu-
ral language understanding. We present
an approach towards PP interpretation as
part of a natural language understanding
system which has been successfully em-
ployed in various NLP tasks for informa-
tion retrieval and question answering. Our
approach is based on the so-called Multi-
Net paradigm, a knowledge representation
formalism especially designed for the rep-
resentation of natural language semantics.
The paper describes how the information
about the semantic interpretation of PPs is
represented in the lexicon and in PP inter-
pretation rules and how this information
is used during semantic analysis. More-
over, we report on experiments that eval-
uate the impact of using this information
about PP interpretation on the CLEF ques-
tion answering task.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999828672727273">
Advanced NLP applications such as question an-
swering require deep semantic interpretation. In
this context, prepositions play an important role
since they encode relational information. The
proper semantic analysis of prepositional phrases
is faced with various problems: (1) There is the
well-known problem of attachment ambiguities.
(2) Prepositions are highly polysemous, i.e. their
interpretation is typically context dependent. (3)
Prepositions often occur in collocations, where
their interpretation is irregular.
Although a large amount of work in the NLP
community has focused on resolving attachment
ambiguities, there are only first steps towards
a systematic description of preposition seman-
tics which has sufficient coverage for NLP appli-
cations (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005; Saint-
Dizier, 2005). The automatic interpretation of
prepositions in English has been tackled, for ex-
ample, by Litkowski (2002), who presents hand-
crafted disambiguation rules, and O’Hara and
Wiebe (2003), who propose a statistical approach
based on collocations. However, in order to be ap-
plicable for semantic inference, the representation
of preposition semantics should ideally be inte-
grated within a full-fledged knowledge represen-
tation formalism.
In spite of the broad linguistic investigations
on preposition semantics,1 the corresponding re-
sults have seldom found their way into real NLP
applications. Information retrieval systems, on
the other hand, which claim to use NLP tech-
niques often do not cope with the semantic con-
tent of prepositions at all (even if they bear the
term semantic in their title, as with Latent Se-
mantic Analysis (Letsche and Berry, 1997)). In
many cases prepositions are even dropped as stop
words in such systems. If one really wants to
syntactico-semantically analyze texts and derive
formal semantic representations, the interpretation
of prepositions and especially the disambiguation
of their different readings is a central problem
in Indoeuropean languages like English, French,
Russian, and German.
In this paper we describe the semantic treat-
ment of this problem for German, using the knowl-
edge representation formalism of Multilayered
Extended Semantic Networks (MultiNet) (Helbig,
2006). The advantage of this approach is its appli-
cability to different languages and different pro-
cesses of automatic natural language understand-
ing. Since MultiNet complies with the criteria
of universality, homogeneity, and interoperability
(Helbig, 2006, Chapter 1), it can be used to for-
malize the semantics of lexemes (Hartrumpf et al.,

Net has been employed for semantic annotation of
large corpora). It can also be used as a seman-
tic interlingua throughout all NLP modules and all
applications of an NLP system (Leveling, 2005).
Typical applications that can profit from a precise
PP interpretation component are question answer-
ing (QA) systems and natural language interfaces.

2 General Classes of PP Interpretation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999420083333333">
The semantic interpretation of prepositions in
NLP has to deal with the following two orthogonal
phenomena: regular (or compositional or produc-
tive) vs. irregular (or non-compositional or col-
locative) uses of prepositions and uses in comple-
ments vs. uses in adjuncts (putting aside the well-
known issue of borderline cases).2 There are thus
the four cases indicated in Table 1. In German,
PPs can occur also as invariant syntagmas in light
verb constructions (‘Funktionsverbgef¨uge’) such
as in Beschlag nehmen (‘to occupy’), to which the
complement-adjunct distinction does not apply. In
the following, we keep aside the interpretation of
prepositions in fixed phrases, which is the case
for the light verb constructions just mentioned and
also for the irregular adjunct interpretation shown
at the lower right of Table 1. This leaves us with
three types of PP interpretation: (regular) adjunct
interpretation, regular complement interpretation,
and irregular complement interpretation.
The standard examples for regular adjunct in-
terpretation are local (or directional) and temporal
PPs, which can be attached to verbs, nouns, and
adjectives:

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.556000181818182">
Notice that German, unlike English, allows ad-
jectives with PP adjuncts (or complements) as at-
tributes of nouns, witness (3).
It is characteristic of regular adjunct interpre-
tation that the preposition has a meaning of its
own and expresses some sort of relationship. Be-
sides local and temporal specifications, there are
of course many other relationships expressed by
regular PP adjuncts such as instrumental (4-a),
comitative (4-b), and part-whole (4-c) interpreta-
tions.3

b. Mary visited London with her sister.
c. a building with large windows
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998694434782609">
The examples in (4) furthermore illustrate the well
known fact that prepositions are highly polyse-
mous in general. Within our approach described
in Sect. 4, prepositions currently have up to six-
teen readings.4
We speak of a regular complement interpreta-
tion if the PP is subcategorized and its interpre-
tation is identical to the (correct) interpretation of
the PP when analyzed as an adjunct. These adjunct
interpretations of PPs are defined by the set of PP
rules, which are explained in Sect. 4.2. Exam-
ples of regular complements are wohnen in/auf/.. .
(‘to live in/on/... ’), schicken nach/in/... (‘to
send to/into/. .. ’), mitkommen mit (‘to come along
with’), and Einstieg in (‘getting in’). Here, the
choice of the preposition in the PP complement of
the lexeme is determined by the semantic charac-
terization of the complement.
In the case of irregular complement interpreta-
tion, in contrast, the selection of the preposition
is an idiosyncratic property of the subcategorizing
lexical entry. The preposition alone can be viewed
as semantically empty; only the combination of
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.994722625">
3In our approach, 91 different relations occur, often in
combinations; see Sect. 4.2.
4The average number of readings is 2.44, which is slightly
higher than the polysemy degree 2.27 (= 847/373) reported
by Litkowski and Hargraves (2005) for English. But our lexi-
con currently contains only few phrasal (or complex) preposi-
tions like in Anbetracht (‘in view of’), which often have only
one reading.

the lexeme and the preposition bears semantics.
Examples for verbs, adjectives, and nouns of this
sort are glauben an (‘to belief in’), sich verlassen
auf (‘to depend on’), gut in (‘good at’), and Wut
auf (‘anger at’).
It should be noted, however, that there is a
whole spectrum of subregular phenomena within
what we called “irregular” complement seman-
tics.5 Consider, for instance, the verbs ernennen
zu, bestimmen zu (‘appoint’, ‘designate’), Uren
zu (‘elect’), and weihen zu (‘ordain’). Even if the
preposition zu (‘to’) could be said to semantically
express some sort of abstract goal in these cases,
an adequate interpretation rule associated with that
preposition would have to make reference to a
rather restricted semantic class of verbs. We re-
gard it therefore as a matter of lexical semantic
organization to capture such subregularities within
the interpretation of prepositional complements by
means of appropriate semantic verb templates in
the lexicon; see (Osswald et al., 2006) for details.
In the context of the present paper, an interpreta-
tion of a prepositional complement is called irreg-
ular if the interpretation is not covered by one of
our PP interpretation rules.
Table 2 show the frequency of adjunct and com-
plement interpretations in different corpora. The
numbers in the token rows are derived from auto-
matic corpus parses (see below), so there is some
noise to be expected, but the trends should be
valid.

3 The Semantic Formalism MultiNet

MultiNet is one of the few knowledge represen-
tation paradigms which have also been used as
a semantic interlingua in real-life NLP applica-
tions (Leveling and Helbig, 2002). The Multi-
Net formalism represents meanings of natural lan-
guage expressions by means of (partial) semantic
networks. A semantic network consists of nodes
representing concepts and edges representing re-
lations between concepts. Every node is addition-
ally labeled by a sort arising from an ontologi-
cally or epistemically motivated classification of
concepts (see Appendix, Table 4). Apart from
that, every node is embedded in a system of layer
attributes and their values expressing the exten-
sion type, facticity, genericity, referential deter-
mination, quantification, and others. The rela-

tions connecting the concepts in a semantic net-
work have to be taken from a predefined set of
expressional means, which are systematically de-
scribed and formally characterized (Helbig, 2006).
A strongly abbreviated description of all MultiNet
relations used in this paper can be found in Table 5
of the Appendix.
For the semantic characterization of the selec-
tional restrictions (i.e. valencies) of lexemes, an
additional set of 16 binary semantic features (such
as animate, human, artificial, movable, and institu-
tion) is provided, which can be combined with the
above-mentioned sorts to yield a rich repertoire of
semantical characterizations for the description of
the slots and fillers corresponding to the valencies.
These expressional means have been used in the
computational lexicon HaGenLex (see Sect. 4.1).

4.1 Selection of PPs in the Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932130434783">
Our parser makes use of the computational lex-
icon HaGenLex (Hagen German Lexicon, see
(Hartrumpf et al., 2003)), which is a general do-
main lexicon for German with about 25,000 en-
tries (including 136 prepositions). Each entry con-
tains detailed morpho-syntactic and semantic in-
formation. In particular, the lexicon provides va-
lency frames for nouns, verbs, and adjectives (in
the lexical feature SELECT). This includes com-
plements that are syntactically realized by a PP.
Each complement is characterized by one or more
syntactic specifications and its semantic contribu-
tion to the head word. This contribution can be a
MultiNet relation (case role) or a more complex
MultiNet expression directly or indirectly con-
necting the representation of the complement and
of the head, which typically involves other com-
plements.
In order to capture semantic constraints on pos-
sible adjuncts, the set of semantic relations com-
patible with a given lexeme is specified in the lex-
icon (under the lexical feature COMPAT-R). This
information is inherited from the semantic class

4.2 Interpretation Rules for Prepositions

The second knowledge source for PP interpreta-
tion are symbolic PP interpretation rules devel-
oped for adjunct interpretations. The premise of
such a rule encodes under which semantic and
syntactic constraints a specific preposition inter-
pretation is possible; the conclusion specifies a
semantic network representing the PP semantics.
Two simplified interpretation rules are shown in

<figureCaption confidence="0.911183285714286">
Fig. 2; the effect of the second rule is depicted in
Fig. 3. The rules are licensing possible interpreta-
tions; if several rule premises can be unified with
a given pair of a preposition’s complement and a
candidate mother, the PP disambiguation module
retreats to a statistical back-off model to resolve
this ambiguity. Currently, we have 332 rules.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998368133333333">
The interpretation rules can be viewed as a
declarative part of the corresponding preposition
entry in the lexicon. For maintenance reasons, the
rules are stored and manipulated separately. They
are linked to the lexicon by lexeme IDs.
The rules show that PP semantics involves many
areas of semantics. For example, MultiNet defines
around 150 relations and 91 of them are used in
the conclusion of PP rules. The 10 most frequent
ones are: LOC, VAL, TEMP, ATTR, ELMT, ATTCH,
DIRCL, INSTR, SUBM, ORIGM (see Table 5). As
exemplified by the second rule of Fig. 2, the se-
mantic network specified in the conclusion of a
rule often consists of more than one network edge;
on average, an interpretation has 1.69 edges.

All the knowledge resources described in Sect. 4
are used by the parser to determine the correct in-
terpretation of prepositions. Furthermore, PP at-
tachment ambiguities are resolved on the basis of
possible interpretations. The complement infor-
mation (valency frames) in the lexicon licenses
possible complement interpretations, the PP inter-
pretation rules (combined with the adjunct infor-
mation in the lexicon) license possible adjunct in-
terpretations. In case of alternatives, they are dis-

Experiments showed that 24.2% of verb comple-
ment interpretations are equally well produced by
adjunct rules (see column 5 in Table 3). Never-
theless the PP interpretation disambiguation task
profits from complement information because in
many of these overlap cases more than one PP in-
terpretation was possible. Also the PP attachment
disambiguation task can benefit from the comple-
ment vs. adjunct distinction because complement-
hood is a strong indicator of the correct attachment
place. A third argument for having such comple-
ment information is that it is important to model
all roles belonging to a concept on the cognitive
level; this can be easily realized by a one-to-one
correspondence between cognitive roles and com-
plements in the lexicon. Table 3 shows the number

for verbs and nouns in our lexicon. The percentage
of regular complements (24.2%) is significantly
higher than the corresponding token value in the

indicates that regular complements often have a
more optional character than irregular comple-
ments. Also in this respect, regular complements
resemble adjuncts.
The preposition interpretation method achieves
between 84% and 89% correctness for the six
prepositions supported by the hand-tagged PP cor-
pus; for prepositions without annotated corpus
data, the performance seems to drop by around 10
to 20 percent points.

6.2 Extrinsic Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999549288135593">
One important application using the parser and the
preposition interpretation described above is In-
Sicht, a QA system for German text collections
(Hartrumpf, 2005). To measure the impact of
a deep preposition interpretation, the QA system
was run twice: with and without the PP interpre-
tation presented above. For the latter, each inter-
pretation of a PP with preposition p, an NP c2,
and syntactic head c1 was replaced by an edge
with the unique artificial relation PP.p, e.g. the
aus-PP rule in Fig. 2 would contain the conclu-
sion (PP.AUS c1 c2). The QA system was eval-
uated on the German questions from the ques-
tion answering track at CLEF (QA@CLEF) of the
years 2004 and 2005. Surprisingly, the PP in-
terpretation with unique artificial relations caused
no significant performance drop. A closer look
at all questions from QA@CLEF 2004 involving
PPs revealed that the documents with answers al-
most always contained the same prepositions as
the corresponding questions. Therefore we tried
more difficult (and often more realistic) questions
with different prepositions (and verbs or nouns).
Only natural and (nearly) equivalent paraphrases
were allowed. For the PP questions where the
QA system delivered correct answers, 14 para-
phrases were written to test the positive impact of
transforming surface prepositions to their correct
meaning.
The evaluation of PP semantics was then per-
formed using the paraphrases instead of the origi-
nal questions. For 86% of all paraphrases, the cor-
rect answer was still found when the more distant
paraphrase was used as the question for the QA
system; with the artificial relations for PPs, only
14% of the paraphrases were answered correctly.
This indicates clearly that NLP applications like
semantic QA systems benefit from a good prepo-
sition interpretation. The paraphrases that could
not be answered by the QA system with PP in-
terpretation would need more advanced reasoning
techniques to work correctly.
Some paraphrases involved PP adjuncts. For ex-
ample, the QA@CLEF question qa04 055 is given
as example (5):
Mandela
Mandela
geboren?
born?
‘In which year was Nelson Mandela born?’
As the documents contain the correct answer in
the form of a PP with the same preposition as in
the question (in), shallow approaches (and also our
QA system with the artificial relations) can answer
this question correctly. But the paraphrase (6) re-
quires that question and documents, which differ
on the surface (in-PP vs. interrogative Wann), are
transformed to the same representation (express-

We have presented a unified approach to the prob-
lem of automatic preposition interpretation. The
extrinsic evaluation result in the context of a QA
system encourages us to continue work in the fol-
lowing directions. The PP interpretation rules are
to be transferred to other languages. We have al-
ready started for English. The transfer on the level
of preposition readings (or PP rules) is much eas-
ier than translating prepositions. Moreover, the
coverage and quality of all three knowledge re-
sources should be further extended. For example,
we want to analyze why certain PP interpretation
rules have rarely succeeded during corpus parsing.
Extrinsic evaluations on larger and more difficult
question sets for QA systems and evaluations in
other NLP applications might help to focus further
research.

<abstract confidence="0.998972727272727">The proper interpretation of prepositions is an important issue for automatic natural language understanding. We present an approach towards PP interpretation as part of a natural language understanding system which has been successfully employed in various NLP tasks for information retrieval and question answering. Our approach is based on the so-called Multi- Net paradigm, a knowledge representation formalism especially designed for the representation of natural language semantics. The paper describes how the information about the semantic interpretation of PPs is represented in the lexicon and in PP interpretation rules and how this information is used during semantic analysis. Moreover, we report on experiments that evaluate the impact of using this information about PP interpretation on the CLEF question answering task.</abstract>

Each entry contains detailed morpho-syntactic and semantic information. In particular, the lexicon provides valency frames for nouns, verbs, and adjectives (in the lexical feature SELECT). This includes complements that are syntactically realized by a PP. Each complement is characterized by one or more syntactic specifications and its semantic contribution to the head word.

It can also be used as a semantic interlingua throughout all NLP modules and all applications of an NLP system (Leveling, 2005). Typical applications that can profit from a precise PP interpretation component are question answering (QA) systems and natural language interfaces. 2 General Classes of PP Interpretation The semantic interpretation of prepositions in NLP has to deal with the following two orthogonal phenomena: regular (or compositional or productive) vs. irregular (or non-compositional or collocative) uses</context>

This indicates that regular complements often have a more optional character than irregular complements. Also in this respect, regular complements resemble adjuncts. The preposition interpretation method achieves between 84% and 89% correctness for the six prepositions supported by the hand-tagged PP corpus; for prepositions without annotated corpus data, the performance seems to drop by around 10 to 20 percent points. 6.2 Extrinsic Evaluation One important application using the parser and the preposition interpretation described above is InSicht, a QA system for German text collections (Hartrumpf, 2005). To measure the impact of a deep preposition interpretation, the QA system was run twice: with and without the PP interpretation presented above. For the latter, each interpretation of a PP with preposition p, an NP c2, and syntactic head c1 was replaced by an edge with the unique artificial relation PP.p, e.g. the aus-PP rule in Fig. 2 would contain the conclusion (PP.AUS c1 c2). The QA system was evaluated on the German questions from the question answering track at CLEF (QA@CLEF) of the years 2004 and 2005. Surprisingly, the PP interpretation with unique artificial relations caused no sign</context>

In many cases prepositions are even dropped as stop words in such systems. If one really wants to syntactico-semantically analyze texts and derive formal semantic representations, the interpretation of prepositions and especially the disambiguation of their different readings is a central problem in Indoeuropean languages like English, French, Russian, and German. In this paper we describe the semantic treatment of this problem for German, using the knowledge representation formalism of Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (MultiNet) (Helbig, 2006). The advantage of this approach is its applicability to different languages and different processes of automatic natural language understanding. Since MultiNet complies with the criteria of universality, homogeneity, and interoperability (Helbig, 2006, Chapter 1), it can be used to formalize the semantics of lexemes (Hartrumpf et al., 1See also the overview given in (Zelinski-Wibbelt, 1993).

However, in order to be applicable for semantic inference, the representation of preposition semantics should ideally be integrated within a full-fledged knowledge representation formalism. In spite of the broad linguistic investigations on preposition semantics,1 the corresponding results have seldom found their way into real NLP applications. Information retrieval systems, on the other hand, which claim to use NLP techniques often do not cope with the semantic content of prepositions at all (even if they bear the term semantic in their title, as with Latent Semantic Analysis (Letsche and Berry, 1997)). In many cases prepositions are even dropped as stop words in such systems.

In this paper we describe the semantic treatment of this problem for German, using the knowledge representation formalism of Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (MultiNet) (Helbig, 2006).

A semantic network consists of nodes representing concepts and edges representing relations between concepts. Every node is additionally labeled by a sort arising from an ontologically or epistemically motivated classification of concepts (see Appendix, Table 4). Apart from that, every node is embedded in a system of layer attributes and their values expressing the extension type, facticity, genericity, referential determination, quantification, and others.

The proper semantic analysis of prepositional phrases is faced with various problems: (1) There is the well-known problem of attachment ambiguities. (2) Prepositions are highly polysemous, i.e. their interpretation is typically context dependent. (3) Prepositions often occur in collocations, where their interpretation is irregular. Although a large amount of work in the NLP community has focused on resolving attachment ambiguities, there are only first steps towards a systematic description of preposition semantics which has sufficient coverage for NLP applications (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005; SaintDizier, 2005). The automatic interpretation of prepositions in English has been tackled, for example, by Litkowski (2002), who presents handcrafted disambiguation rules, and O’Hara and Wiebe (2003), who propose a statistical approach based on collocations.

Here, the choice of the preposition in the PP complement of the lexeme is determined by the semantic characterization of the complement. In the case of irregular complement interpretation, in contrast, the selection of the preposition is an idiosyncratic property of the subcategorizing lexical entry. The preposition alone can be viewed as semantically empty; only the combination of 3In our approach, 91 different relations occur, often in combinations; see Sect. 4.2. 4The average number of readings is 2.44, which is slightly higher than the polysemy degree 2.27 (= 847/373) reported by Litkowski and Hargraves (2005) for English. But our lexicon currently contains only few phrasal (or complex) prepositions like in Anbetracht (‘in view of’), which often have only one reading. 30 the lexeme and the preposition bears semantics. Examples for verbs, adjectives, and nouns of this sort are glauben an (‘to belief in’), sich verlassen auf (‘to depend on’), gut in (‘good at’), and Wut auf (‘anger at’). It should be noted, however, that there is a whole spectrum of subregular phenomena within what we called “irregular” complement semantics.5 Consider, for instance, the verbs ernennen zu, bestimmen zu (‘appoint’, ‘de</context>

Even if the preposition zu (‘to’) could be said to semantically express some sort of abstract goal in these cases, an adequate interpretation rule associated with that preposition would have to make reference to a rather restricted semantic class of verbs. We regard it therefore as a matter of lexical semantic organization to capture such subregularities within the interpretation of prepositional complements by means of appropriate semantic verb templates in the lexicon; see (Osswald et al., 2006) for details. In the context of the present paper, an interpretation of a prepositional complement is called irregular if the interpretation is not covered by one of our PP interpretation rules.

This leaves us with three types of PP interpretation: (regular) adjunct interpretation, regular complement interpretation, and irregular complement interpretation. The standard examples for regular adjunct interpretation are local (or directional) and temporal PPs, which can be attached to verbs, nouns, and adjectives: (1) a. He walked to the museum. b. They met in August. (2) a. the building on the hill b. the debate on Wednesday 2See also (Rauh, 1993). Notice that German, unlike English, allows adjectives with PP adjuncts (or complements) as attributes of nouns, witness (3). It is characteristic of regular adjunct interpretation that the preposition has a meaning of its own and expresses some sort of relationship. Besides local and temporal specifications, there are of course many other relationships expressed by regular PP adjuncts such as instrumental (4-a), comitative (4-b), and part-whole (4-c) interpretations.3 (4) a.
