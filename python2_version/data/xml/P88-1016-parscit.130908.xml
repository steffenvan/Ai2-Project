<bodyText confidence="0.9996031">
Narrative passages told from a character&apos;s perspective
convey the character&apos;s thoughts and perceptions. We
present a discourse process that recognizes characters&apos;
thoughts and perceptions in third-person narrative. An
effect of perspective on reference in narrative is
addressed: references in passages told from the perspec-
tive of a character reflect the character&apos;s beliefs. An
algorithm that uses the results of our discourse process
to understand references with respect to an appropriate
set of beliefs is presented.

1. INTRODUCTION. A narrative is often told from the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.974312316455696">
perspective of one or more of its characters; it can also con-
tain passages that are not told from the perspective of any
character. We present a computational theory of how
readers recognize the current perspective in third-person nar-
rative, and of the effects of perspective on the way readers
understand references in third-person narrative. We consider
published novels and short stories, rather than artificially
constructed narratives.
2. BANFIELD&apos;S THEORY. Our notion of perspective in
narrative is based on Ann &amp;infield&apos;s (1982) categorization
of the sentences of narration into subjective and objective
sentences. Subjective sentences include those that portray a
character&apos;s thoughts (represented thought) or present a scene
as a character perceives it (represented perception). Objec-
tive sentences present the story directly, rather than through
the thoughts or perceptions of a character. The language
used to convey thoughts and perceptions is replete with
linguistic elements that make no sense unless they are inter-
preted with respect to the thinking or perceiving character&apos;s
consciousness. Banfield calls them subjective elements; they
appear only in subjective sentences and cannot appear within
objective sentences. &amp;Infield identifies perspective in narra-
tive with subjectivity, which is expressible via subjective
elements. We call the thinking or perceiving character of a
subjective sentence the subjective character.
3. A DISCOURSE-LEVEL APPROACH. Our task of
recognizing the current perspective is, therefore, to recognize
subjective sentences and the subjective characters to whom
they are attributed. However, we cannot take a sentence-
by-sentence approach, deciding independently for each sen-
tence whether it is objective or subjective, and, if subjective,
who the subjective character is. First, although thoughts and
perceptions are often reported (as by sentences beginning
with &amp;quot;He thought that .. . &amp;quot; or &amp;quot;She saw . &amp;quot;), and
thoughts are often accompanied by narrative parentheticals
(such as &amp;quot;he thought&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;he realized&amp;quot;), many thoughts
and perceptions are not marked in these ways. Second, sub-
jective sentences do not always explicitly indicate who the
subjective character is. For example:
(1) 11He wanted to talk to Dermys. 11How were they
going to be able to get home from this strange desert
land into which they had been cast and which was
heaven knew where in all the countless solar systems
in all the countless galaxies? [L&apos;Engle, Many Waters,
p.91]
(2) 1But what [Muhammad] had seen in those few
moments made him catch his breath in amazement
220n the floor of the cave, which curved back in a
natural fault in the rock, there were several large
cylindrical objects standing in a row. [John Allegro,
The Dead Sea Scrolls]
Sentence (1.2) is a represented thought, and (2.2) is a
represented perception, presenting what the character sees as
he sees it, yet neither is explicitly marked as such. Also, nei-
ther indicates who the subjective character is. Finally,
although a subjective element marks a sentence as subjective
(cf. Section 42), not all subjective sentences contain subjec-
tive elements, and subjective elements do not in general
indicate who the subjective character is.
However, subjective sentences that are not marked as
such, or that do not indicate who the subjective character is,
usually appear in the midst of other subjective sentences
attributed to the same subjective character. That is, once a
clearly marked subjective sentence appears for which the
subjective character can be determined, unmarked subjective
sentences attributed to the same subjective character often
follow. Thus, to recognize subjective sentences in general,
we need to consider subjectivity at the level of the discourse.
For this reason, we extend the notions of subjective and
objective sentences to the notions of subjective and objective
contexts, which consist of one or more subjective sentences
attributed to the same subjective character, or one or more
objective sentences, respectively.
Our algorithm for recognizing the current perspective
is a discourse process that looks for the boundaries of sub-
jective contexts. During narrative understanding, it main-
tains a stack, called the current perspective (CP). At the
beginning of a narrative, the CP is initialized to be the
reader. When a new subjective context is recognized, its
</bodyText>

131
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.986628896551724">
subjective character is pushed onto the CP. When the end of
a subjective context is recognized, a character is popped
from the CP. More precisely, since SNePS (Shapiro 1979),
our knowledge representation system, is fully intensional,
only the reader&apos;s concepts of the characters are represented
(Maida and Shapiro 1982, Shapiro and Rapaport 1987). So,
it is actually the reader&apos;s concepts of the characters that are
pushed onto the CP.
4. RECOGNIZING SUBJECTIVE CONTEXTS. To
recognize subjective contexts, our discourse process relies
exclusively on linguistic signals of subjective contexts. In
this, it is incomplete: If a subjective context appears in
which these linguistic signals are not present, then the sub-
jective context is not recognized.
4.1. Psychological Verbs, Actions, Adjectives, and Per-
ceptual Verbs. Reports involving psychological verbs (e.g.,
&apos;think&apos;, &apos;wonder&apos;, &apos;realize&apos;, &apos;want&apos;, &apos;remember&apos;) or .percep-
tual verbs (e.g.. &apos;see&apos;, &apos;hear&apos;) signal that a subjective context
will follow. So do predicate-adjective sentences with
psychological adjectives (e.g., &apos;delighted&apos;, &apos;happy&apos;, &apos;jealous&apos;,
&apos;scared&apos;) (cf. Banfield (1982), Cohn (1978), Doleiel (1973)).
In addition, we have identified what we call psychological
actions—e.g., &amp;quot;he smiled to himself&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;she gasped&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;she
winced&amp;quot;—which function in the same way as psychological
verbs.
A sentence of one of these types is a typical way of
establishing a subjective context. Examples (1) and (2),
above, and (3), below, exhibit this pattern:
(3) &apos;She [Hannah] winced as she heard them crash to
the platform. &amp;quot;The lovely little mirror that she had
brought for Ellen, and the gifts for the baby! [Fran-
chere, Hannah HerseV, p.3]
In each example, the first sentence is a psychological or per-
ceptual report, and the second is a represented thought or
represented perception, respectively; the subjective character
of the second sentence is taken to be the subject of the first.
In our discourse process, the subject of a perceptual or
psychological report, or of a predicate-adjective sentence
with a psychological adjective, is pushed onto the CP if a
character isn&apos;t already on the top of it. If a character is
already on the top of the CP, then no change is made, and
the sentence is understood to be part of the already esta-
blished subjective context.
4.2. Subjective Elements. Many subjective elements mark
a sentence in third-person narrative as subjective because
they are expressive in nature. Some that Banfield identifies
are exclamations, which express emotion; questions, which
express wonder, epithets, such as &apos;the bastard&apos;, which
express some qualification of the referent; and certain kin-
ship terms, e.g., &apos;Daddy&apos;, &apos;Mom&apos;, and &apos;Aunt Margaret&apos;,
which express a relationship to the referent She also
identifies evaluative adjectives, which express an attitude
toward the referent, e.g., &apos;ghastly&apos;, &apos;surprising&apos;, &apos;poor&apos;, and
&apos;damned&apos;, although some evaluative adjectives, such as
&apos;poor&apos; and &apos;damned&apos;, have their evaluative meanings only
when they occur in certain parts of the sentence. Intensifiers
such as &apos;too&apos;, &apos;quite&apos;, and `so&apos; are also evaluative (Banfield
1982), as in:

(4) He could tell they were tears because his eyes were
too shiny. Too round. [Bridgers, AU Together Now,
p. 92]
So are emphasizers, such as &apos;really&apos; and &apos;just&apos;. An example
is &apos;really&apos; in (5.3):
(5) &amp;quot;Jody managed a frail smile. 52She was a little bit
ashamed. siShe should really try to be more cheerful

for Aunt Margaret&apos;s sake. 5&amp;quot;After all, Aunt Margaret
had troubles of her own—she was the mother of that
ghastly Dill. [Gage, Miss Osborne-the-Mop, pp. 16-
17]
Modal verbs of obligation, possibility, and necessity are also
expressive. For example, &apos;should&apos;, in (53), is a modal verb
of obligation. So are many content (or attitudinal) disjuncts,
which comment on the content of the utterance (Quirk et al.
1985). For example, &apos;likely&apos;. &apos;maybe&apos;, &apos;probably&apos;, and
&apos;perhaps&apos; express some degree of doubt:
(6) Something jingled—car keys probably. [Oneal, War
Work, p. 132]
Conjuncts, which comment on the connection between items
(Quirk et al. 1985), can also be expressive. For example,
&apos;anyhow&apos;, &apos;anyway&apos;, &apos;still&apos;, and &apos;after all&apos; express conces-
sion (Quirk et al. 1985). An example is &apos;After all&apos; in (5.4).
Other subjective elements are sentence fragments
(Banfield 1982), such as (7.2),
(7) &amp;quot;His brain worked slowly through what he knew
about this person. &amp;quot;David&apos;s kid. [Bridgers, All
Together Now, p. 91]
and the uses of &apos;this&apos;, &apos;that&apos;, &apos;these&apos;, and &apos;those&apos; that Robin
Lakoff (1974) has identified as emotional deixis. In conver-
sation, they are &amp;quot;generally linked to the speaker&apos;s emotional
involvement in the subject-matter of his utterance&amp;quot; (Lakoff
1974: 347); in third-person narrative, they are linked to the
subjective character&apos;s emotional involvement in the subject
matter of his thoughts or perceptions. Examples are &apos;this&apos; in
(8.1) and &amp;quot;That&apos; in (9.2):

(9) &amp;quot;As she watched, a wave of jealousy spread through
her. &amp;quot;That insufferable stranger who had passed

[Franchere, Hannah Herself, p. 15]
In speech, the emotion, evaluation, etc., expressed by
a subjective element is always attributed to the speaker in
third-person narrative, it is attributed to a character.&apos; Clearly,
many types of language-understanding abilities are needed to
understand the range of subjective elements. Our purpose
here is to show how our discourse process uses them as
markers of subjective contexts, and how it determines the
subjective character whose thoughts or perceptions they
mark. However, recognizing the subjective character is
always required before a subjective element can be under-
stood.
When a subjective element is encountered in the nar-
rative, our discourse process updates the CP according to the
following algorithm:
(Al)
If there is currently a character on the CP,
&apos;then do not change the CP
else if there is an actor focus at the start of the current
sentence who is a character in the scene
2then push him or her onto the CP
3else create a new and indeterminate concept and push
it onto the CP.
4.2.1. Discussion of branch 1. Branch 1 is taken when a
subjective element continues the current subjective context.
For example, the exclamation in (3.2), which is a subjective
element, continues the subjective context established by
(3.1). The subjective elements &apos;should&apos; and &apos;really&apos; in (5.3)
and &apos;After all&apos;, &apos;Aunt Margaret&apos;, &apos;that&apos;, and &apos;ghastly&apos; in (5.4)
continue the subjective context established in (5.1).
4.2.2. Discussion of branch 2. The actor focus used in
branch 2 is one of the foci that need to be maintained for the
comprehension of definite anaphora (Sidner 1983). It is
whoever is the agent of the current sentence. (Note that
quoted speech has its own foci, which must be maintained
separately. In this sense, quoted speech constitutes a
separate discourse segment (cf. Grosz and Sidner (1986).)
Consider the following example:
(10) &amp;quot;11In the kitchen she [Jody] set the basket down on
the table. 1°2She put the thermos and the cups in the
sink and filled them with cool water to soak. 1°3Then
In sane third-person novels, panic:Wady in the 19th century,
an overt narrator (Chum= 1978) uses subjective elements. We do
not consider novels with overt narrators.
she tiptoed upstairs to her room. &apos;&amp;quot;Perhaps Aunt
Margaret was taking a nap. 1°2It wouldn&apos;t do to dis-
turb her. [Gage, Miss Osborne-the-Mop, p. 25]
Since Jody is the actor focus at the beginning of (10.4) (she
is the actor focus of (10.1)-(10.3)), and she is a character in
the scene, the subjective element &apos;Perhaps&apos; is attributed to
her when it is encountered, and she is pushed onto the CP.
Sidner (1983) has shown that, in anaphora
comprehension, the current actor or discourse focus can be
rejected as the co-specifier of an anaphor on the basis of
pragmatic factors. Similarly, the actor focus may be rejected
as the subjective character to whom the subjective element is
attributed, in favor of another character in the scene. The
pragmatic factors involved appear to be which characters
have been subjective characters in the past and whose
thoughts or perceptions the sentence containing the subjec-
tive element is likely to be reflecting. Consider the follow-
ing example, in which Adnarel, a seraph, has just appeared
before Lemech and Sandy:
(11) &amp;quot;&apos;Lemech greeted him [Adnarel] respectfully.
&amp;quot;Adnarel we thank you.&amp;quot; 1121&apos;hen he said to Sandy,
&amp;quot;The seraph will be able to help you. Seraphim
know much about healing.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;So this was a seraph. [L&apos;Engle, Many Waters,
p. 39]
Lemech is the actor focus of (11.1) and (112). However, it
would be clear to someone who had read the novel up to this
point that (11.3) is Sandy&apos;s thought. First, Sandy is a visitor
to a strange world, of which Lemech is an inhabitant; so it is
Sandy, not Lemech, who is likely not to have lmown what a
seraph is. Second, prior to this passage, subjective contexts
have been attributed to Sandy, but not to Lemech. We are
investigating the reasoning required by the reader in reject-
ing the current actor in favor of another character.
4.23. Discussion of branch 3. Branch 3 is taken when the
reader cannot identify the subjective character and must read
further in the text in order to do so. In this case, an indeter-
minate, intensional concept is pushed onto the CP. When
the reader finally identifies the subjective character, the
information that this character and the indeterminate one are
co-extensional is built (that is, it is asserted that they are
concepts of the same individual; cf. Maida and Shapiro
(1982), Shapiro and Rapaport (1987)). Naicong Li (1986)
uses this approach in her pronoun resolution algorithm if the
information needed to resolve a pronoun is supplied after the
pronoun is encountered.
Often, the subjective character is identified by a nar-
rative parenthetical, as in the following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.946707333333333">
(12) &apos;What was holding Washington up? the colonel
asked himself. 124All he needed was a simple yes or
no. [Clancy, Red Storm Rising, p. 170]
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.996861">
133
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998817470588235">
Sentence (12.1) begins with a question, which is a subjective
element. It occurs just after a shift in scene, so it does not
continue a current subjective context, and there is no actor
focus. When &apos;What&apos; is encountered in (12.1), branch 3
pushes a new concept onto the CP: At this point, the reader
has recognized someone&apos;s thought, but does not yet know
whose. When the reader encounters the parenthetical, she
identifies the subjective character as the colonel, and builds
a proposition that the colonel and the new concept are co-
extensional (that is, she comes to believe that the question
was the colonel&apos;s thought).
4.2.4. Comparison of evaluative and psychological
adjectives. Before leaving our discussion of subjective ele-
ments, it will be useful to contrast the ways that predicate-
adjective sentences with psychological and with evaluative
adjectives are treated by our discourse process. Compare
the following sentences:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.978253">
(A) Jody was delighted.
(B) Jody was ghastly.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9851193">
Sentence (A) contains the psychological adjective
&apos;delighted&apos;, and (B) contains the evaluative adjective
&apos;ghastly&apos;. In (A) (assuming no previous subjective context),
Jody is pushed onto the CP, and (A) establishes a subjective
context attributed to Jody. In (B), algorithm (Al) determines
whose attitude toward Jody is being expressed, and it does
not choose the subject of the sentence. Thus, psychological
adjectives can establish the perspective of the subject,
whereas evaluative adjectives express an attitude toward the
subject.

5. RECOGNIZING ENDING BOUNDARIES OF SUB-
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988878736842105">
JECTIVE CONTEXTS. Recognizing the ending boun-
daries of subjective contexts is a more difficult problem than
recognizing the beginning boundaries. While not all subjec-
tive contexts are signaled in the ways discussed in Section 4,
it is very common that they are. However, we have not
found equally reliable or common signals for the ending
boundaries. It appears that the reader often has to reason
about the content of the current sentence and confirm that it
can continue the subjective context; if it cannot, then the
ending boundary has been found.
Nevertheless, we have identified two reliable ways of
recognizing the ending boundaries of subjective contexts.
One way subjective contexts are ended is by a shift in scene,
as in the following example:
(13) He [Sandy] wanted to talk to Dennys. How were
they going to be able to get home from this strange
desert land into which they had been cast and which
was heaven knew where in all the countless solar sys-
tems in all the countless galaxies?
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.546477">

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990325745454546">
Dennys was sleeping fitfully when he heard the tent
flap move. [L&apos;Engle, Many Waters, pp. 91-92]
Dennys and Sandy are not at the same place. The shift in
scene at the chapter break ends the subjective context attri-
buted to Sandy.
A second way is by a negated perceptual report
whose subject is the subjective character and whose object is
something in the scene. For example,
(14) 14.1Sne&apos; [Yalith] was not sure why she was hesitant.
&amp;quot;She breathed in the strange odor of his wings,
smelling of stone, of the cold, dark winds which came
during the few brief weeks of winter.
&apos;Enveloped in Eblis&apos;s wings, she did not hear the
rhythmic thud as a great lion galloped toward them
across the desert, roaring as it neared them. 14&apos;4Then
both Yalith and Eblis turned and saw the lion rising
to its hind legs .. . [L&apos;Engle, Many Waters, p. 47]
The subjective context in the first paragraph is ended by the
negated perceptual verb in (143). Sentence (14.4) then
establishes a new subjective context attributed to Yalith and
Eblis. In a similar way, subjective contexts can be ended by
negated factive verbs, as in &amp;quot;He did not realize that...&amp;quot;.
6. BELIEF AND SUBJECTIVE CONTEXTS. Since
subjective contexts portray thoughts and perceptions, the
reader understands that the information they convey reflects
the subjective character&apos;s beliefs (cf. Fillmore (1974),
&amp;infield (1982), Uspensky (1973)). Whatever else the
reader may infer that the characters believe, she has to attri-
bute the information in subjective contexts to the subjective
character. Brian Reiser (1981) showed that one of the
effects of perspective on a reader&apos;s understanding is that it
focuses processing. In particular, he showed that the reader
primarily infers the goals and plans of the character whose
perspective the narrative is taking. In a similar way, per-
spective focuses the reader&apos;s attribution of beliefs to the
characters. •
References in subjective contexts reflect just what the
subjective character believes. (Cf. Clark and Marshall
(1981), Cohen, Perrault, and Allen (1982), and Wilks and
Bien (1983) for discussions of belief and reference in
conversation.) The subjective character might be mistaken,
or know less about the referent than the reader or the other
characters know, or know more than the other characters.
The remainder of this paper addresses the attribution of
beliefs to characters in order to understand references in sub-
jective contexts.
6.1. An Algorithm for Understanding References Using
the CP. Our belief representation, described in Rapaport
and Shapiro (1984), Rapaport (1986), and Wiebe and Rapa-
port (1986), is based on the notion of belief spaces. A belief
space is accessed by a stack of individuals, and consists of
what the bottom member of the stack believes that . .. the
top member believes. The reader is always the bottom
member of the stack, and the belief space corresponding to a
stack consisting only of the reader contains the set of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994508">
134
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.994531873786408">
propositions that the reader believes are true. All proposi-
tions in the knowledge base appear in at least one belief
space, and a single proposition can appear in more than one
belief space. This occurs, for example, if the reader believes
a proposition and believes that a character believes it, too.
The CP determines the current belief space with
respect to which references are understood. So far, our
analysis extends only to non-anaphoric, specific references.
The following is our algorithm for understanding a non-
anaphoric, specific reference &apos;X&apos; in third-person narrative
(there may actually be more than one proposition found or
built in order to understand &apos;X&apos;, for example, if &apos;X&apos; is plural
or a possessive):
(A2)
If &apos;X&apos; is an indefinite noun phrase of the form &apos;a Y&apos;.
&apos;then create a new concept, N; build in the CP&apos;s
belief space the proposition that N is a Y;
return N
else if &apos;X&apos; is a definite noun phrase or proper name,
then if a proposition that N is X can be found in
the CP&apos;s belief space,
2then return N
else if a proposition that N is X can be found in a
belief space other than the CP&apos;s,
3then add the found proposition to the CP&apos;s
belief space; return N
&apos;else create a new concept. N; build in the CP&apos;s
belief space the proposition that N is X;
return N.
6.1.1. Discussion of branch 1. Indefinite references intro-
duce new individuals into the CP&apos;s belief space. We discuss
this in Section 6.3, below.
6.1.2. Discussion of branches 2 and 3. The search for the
referent of a non-anaphoric definite noun phrase or proper
name starts in the CP&apos;s belief space. Branch 2 is taken if
the referent can be found there.
If the test in branch 2 fails, then the rest of the
knowledge base must be searched. To see why this is so,
suppose that the reference is &apos;Ellen&apos; and that it occurs in a
subjective context. It is possible that Ellen has been referred
to previously in the narrative but not under any cir-
cumstances that would have required the reader to explicitly
attribute the belief that she is named &apos;Ellen&apos; to the subjective
character. Perhaps she has only been referred to in objective
contexts, for example. So, to find the referent, other belief
spaces than the CP&apos;s must be searched.
Branch 3 is taken if the search is successful, and,
before the referent is returned, the proposition that the
referent is X is added to the CP&apos;s belief space. In the case
just discussed, the fact that the reference occurs in a subjec-
tive context indicates that the belief that the referent is
named &apos;Ellen&apos; should now be attributed to the subjective
character.
6.1.3. Discussion of branch 4. Branch 4 is taken in order
to understand definite noun phrases and proper names that
refer to individuals who have not been previously introduced
into the narrative. For example, in (3.2), above, neither the
mirror, the gifts, the baby, nor Ellen have been mentioned
before in the novel. A new referent for each is introduced
into the CP&apos;s belief space; that is, by virtue of understanding
the references in (3.2), the reader comes to believe that Han-
nah, the subjective character, believes that there is a mirror,
some gifts, a baby, and a person named &apos;Ellen&apos;.
6.1.4. An example. We now illustrate our algorithms on a
passage that reflects a character&apos;s mistaken belief. The pas-
sage is from a novel in which a character, Dwayne, mistak-
enly believes that another character, Casey, is a boy:
(15) 133His [Dwayne&apos;s] brain worked slowly through what
he knew about this person [Casey]. 132David&apos;s kid.
33.3The name stumbled into place. &amp;quot;&apos;This was
David&apos;s boy. 13-3David was in the war, and here was
his kid in the arcade scared of something. [Bridgers,
All Together Now, p. 91]
Note that (15.1) and (153) are psychological reports that
employ metaphor, rather than psychological verbs, to report
the character&apos;s psychological experience ((9.1), above,
employs metaphor in a similar way). Metaphor is beyond
the scope of this work so, before applying our algorithm to
this passage, we paraphrase it as follows:
(15a) 13`114e [Dwayne] thought of what he }mew about this
person [Casey]. 131-2David&apos;s kid. 1513He remembered
the name. 13&amp;quot;This was David&apos;s boy. 15L5David was
in the war, and here was his kid in the arcade scared
of something.
Fast, consider the operation of our discourse process.
Sentence (15a.1) is a psychological report, and so Dwayne,
its subject, is pushed onto the CP; this establishes a subjec-
tive context, attributed to Dwayne, which is continued
throughout the passage. Note that when the sentence frag-
ment (which is a subjective element) is encountered, no
change is made to the CP because there is already a charac-
ter on the top of it. Similarly, no change is made to the CP
when (15a.3), a psychological tuport, and the second con-
junct of (15a.5), a predicate-adjective sentence with a
psychological adjective, are encountered, since there is
already a character on the top of the CP.
Now, consider the reference to David in (15a.2). The
reader knows that David is Casey&apos;s father. If, before read-
ing (15a.2), the reader didn&apos;t explicitly believe that Dwayne
knew about David too, then branch 3 of algorithm (A2)
would be taken to understand this reference; the result is that
the reader now explicitly believes that Dwayne knows about
David.

&apos;David&apos;s boy&apos; in (15a.4) reflects Dwayne&apos;s mistaken
belief about Casey, and branch 2 of algorithm (A2) is taken
in order to understand it. To illustrate that information in
subjective contexts is attributed to the subjective character,
suppose that (15a.4) were &amp;quot;This was David&apos;s girl&amp;quot;; in that
case, the reader would have to infer that Dwayne had
somehow found out that Casey is a girl.
6.1.5. Further discussion of algorithm (A2). Note that if
a reference is a subjective element, such as &apos;the bastard&apos;, it
may be a non-classificatory noun (Benueld 1982); that is, it
cannot be understood entirely propositionally, since it
expresses subjectivity. How it should be understood
depends on the particular subjective element. Thus, specific
algorithms for nouns that are subjective elements must
supersede algorithm (A2).
As mentioned above, algorithm (A2) is unable to
understand anaphoric references. However, anaphor
comprehension can be affected by perspective. Consider the
following passage:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.843205666666667">
(16) 16.1The man had turned. He started to walk away
quickly in the direction of the public library.
16.3&amp;quot;0.IC.,&amp;quot; said Joe, &amp;quot;get Rosie.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996650320987655">
16.4zoe crept back to the blanket. &apos;She felt hollow
in her stomach. miShe&apos;d never really expected to see
the Enemy again. [Onea], War Work, p. 64]
In (16.6), &apos;the Enemy&apos; is an anaphoric reference that occurs
in a subjective context (established by (16.5). which is a
psychological report); it co-specifies &apos;the man&apos; in (16.1) and
&apos;He&apos; in (16.2). It reflects Zoe&apos;s belief that the man is an
enemy spy, although it is not at all clear to the reader, at this
point, that he is.
Personal pronouns can also reflect the beliefs of a
character. The following passage is a continuation of pas-
sage (15) (italics ours):
(17) He [Dwayne] wasn&apos;t sure of what. What in the
arcade could scare a boy like that? He rubbed his
head under his baseball cap. He could see tears in
Casey&apos;s eyes. He could tell they were tears because
his eyes were too shiny. Too round. Well, it was all
right to cry. He&apos;d cried when they took him to that
place a few years back. Now Casey was in a new
place, too, feeling maybe the same as him. If he just
knew what to do about it.
&amp;quot;Let&apos;s don&apos;t play that game anymore,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I
don&apos;t like that one.&amp;quot;
Casey wiped her face on her sleeve .. . [Bridgers,
All Together Now, p. 92]
Both italicized pronouns refer to Casey; the first occurs in a
subjective context attributed to Dwayne, and the second
occurs after the subjective context has ended (in this pas-
sage, the subjective context is ended by direct speech).
6.2. Assertive Indefinite Pronouns. Assertive indefinite
pronouns—e.g., &apos;someone&apos;, &apos;something&apos;, &apos;somebody&apos;—are
specific, though unspecified (Quirk et al. 1985); that is. they
generally refer to particular people, things, etc., without
identifying them. When referring to a particular referent, a
speaker typically uses an assertive indefinite pronoun if (1)
she doesn&apos;t know the identity of the referent, (2) she doesn&apos;t
want the addressee to know the identity of the referent, or
(3) she doesn&apos;t believe that the identity of the referent is
relevant to the conversation. A character&apos;s thoughts and
perceptions are not directed toward an addressee, and so the
first of these uses is the predominant one in subjective con-
texts. Used in this way, they express a lack of knowledge,
and so are subjective elements. When one of them appears
in a subjective context, the reader understands that the sub-
jective character does not know who or what the referent is.
Often, the pronoun is the only source of this information.
Consider the following example:
(18) 1&amp;quot;Suddenly she [&apos;Zoe] gasped. 111.2She had touched
somebody! [Oneal, War Work, p. 129]
There is no explicit statement in the novel that Zoe does not
know whom she touched; this has to be inferred from the
use of &apos;somebody&apos;. Sentences (6) and (15.5) provide further
examples.
63. Indefinite References. In conversation, definite refer-
ences are used only if the speaker believes that the addressee
has enough information to interpret them. As mentioned
above, thoughts and perceptions are not directed toward an
addressee, and so the use of definite references in subjective
contexts is not subject to this constraint; as illustrated by
(32), they are used to refer to referents familiar to the sub-
jective character, whether or not the reader has been told
about them before. So, when a specific indefinite reference
appears in a subjective context, the reader understands that
the referent is unfamiliar to the subjective character; other-
wise, a definite reference would have appeared (Fillmore
1974).
However, the referent may not be unknown to the
reader or to the other characters. For example,
(19) There they [the King and his men] saw close beside
them a great rubbleheap; and suddenly they were
aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease,
grey-clad, hardly to be seen among the stones. [Tol-
kien. The Two Towers, p. 206]
The reader knows that the King and his men have come
upon two hobbits, Merry and Pippin. The King and his men
do not know the hobbits, but other characters also present in
the scene do know them. When the King and his men are
on the top of the CP (after &apos;saw&apos; and continued by &apos;were
aware of&apos;), the hobbits are not referred to by name, but as
&apos;two small figures&apos;. Branch 1 of algorithm (A2) creates new
referents and, in the belief space of the King and his men.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996366">
136
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.991052376623377">
builds propositions that they are small figures. The new
referents can be asserted to be co-extensional with the con-
cepts who the reader and other characters believe are named
&apos;Merry&apos; and &apos;Pippin&apos;.
Indefinite references can sometimes indicate that the
subjective character doesn&apos;t even know what the referent is.
This occurs when the head noun is a superordinate, rather
than a basic-level, term (Rosch and Lloyd 1978). The basic
level is the preferred level at which people identify things.
If a superordinate, rather than a basic-level, term appears in
an indefinite reference in a subjective context, the reader
understands that the subjective character can&apos;t even identify
the referent at the basic level. In example (19), the hobbits
are referred to as &apos;two small figures&apos;, because the King and
his men have never seen hobbits before. Here is an example
that is not from a fantasy novel:
(20) Slowly Hannah raised her head and blinked her eyes.
Small dots of purple covered the ground around her
and she reached out to explore. Violets! [Franchere,
Hannah HerseY, p. 25]
When she first sees the violets, Hannah can only identify
them as &apos;small dots of purple&apos;. Another occurs in (2.2):
The fact that the reference &apos;several large cylindrical objects&apos;
includes the superordinate term &apos;objects&apos; indicates that
Muhammad doesn&apos;t know what the referents are. Another
example is (21):
(21) He felt firm restraints of some sort holding him in
place. [Wu. Cyborg, p. 141]
Peters and Shapiro (1987ab) describe a SNePS
representation for natural category systems in which superor-
dinate categories can be distinguished from basic-level and
subordinate categories. After an indefinite reference with a
superordinate term in a subjective context has been parsed,
the fact that the subjective character was able to identify the
referent only at a superordinate level is represented in the
knowledge base by using their representation.
7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH. Many
problems remain to be solved. Our discourse process cannot
recognize subjective contexts that are not established by the
linguistic signals it relies on, and general principles are
needed to explain how readers recognize the ending boun-
daries of subjective contexts. We are investigating how
tense, deictic terms (cf. Bruder et al. (1986), &amp;infield
(1982)), the characters&apos; goals (cf. Wilensky (1983)), and the
argument structure (cf. Cohen (1987)) often exhibited by
thoughts might be used to recognize the boundaries of sub-
jective contexts. Branches 2 and 3 of algorithm (Al) need to
be expanded to determine who the subjective character is if
the actor focus isn&apos;t a reasonable candidate and no
parenthetical appears. We are investigating how focus of
attention (cf. Grosz (1981), Sidney (1983)) can be incor-
porated into algorithm (A2) in such a way that anaphoric
references reflecting the beliefs of a character can be under-
stood. Finally, there is the general problem of revision. Our
algorithms assume that signals occur at the beginning of
subjective contexts. However, there are cases when a sub-
jective context cannot be recognized until some of it has
already been parsed. A difficult case is illustrated by the fol-
lowing: &amp;quot;Jody was rich and famous. °Why wasn&apos;t she
happy? Bill wondered.&amp;quot; Only after reading (C2) can the
reader recognize that (Cl) is a represented thought.
We have argued that a discourse-level approach must
be taken to the problem of recognizing character&apos;s thoughts
and perceptions in third-person narrative. Our discourse
process, which is implemented in an ATN grammar inter-
faced to SNePS, recognizes subjective contexts that are
linguistically signaled in ways frequently employed in
naturally-occurring narratives. By using the results of the
discourse process to determine the belief context needed to
understand references, our reference algorithm demonstrates
how perspective affects reference in third-person narrative.

In addition, we have identified what we call psychological actions—e.g., &amp;quot;he smiled to himself&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;she gasped&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;she winced&amp;quot;—which function in the same way as psychological verbs. A sentence of one of these types is a typical way of establishing a subjective context. Examples (1) and (2), above, and (3), below, exhibit this pattern: (3) &apos;She [Hannah] winced as she heard them crash to the platform. &amp;quot;The lovely little mirror that she had brought for Ellen, and the gifts for the baby!

Since subjective contexts portray thoughts and perceptions, the reader understands that the information they convey reflects the subjective character&apos;s beliefs (cf. Fillmore (1974), &amp;infield (1982), Uspensky (1973)). Whatever else the reader may infer that the characters believe, she has to attribute the information in subjective contexts to the subjective character. Brian Reiser (1981) showed that one of the effects of perspective on a reader&apos;s understanding is that it focuses processing. In particular, he showed that the reader primarily infers the goals and plans of the character whose perspective the narrative is taking. In a similar way, perspective focuses the reader&apos;s attribution of beliefs to the characters. • References in subjective contexts reflect just what </context>

As mentioned above, thoughts and perceptions are not directed toward an addressee, and so the use of definite references in subjective contexts is not subject to this constraint; as illustrated by (32), they are used to refer to referents familiar to the subjective character, whether or not the reader has been told about them before. So, when a specific indefinite reference appears in a subjective context, the reader understands that the referent is unfamiliar to the subjective character; otherwise, a definite reference would have appeared (Fillmore 1974). However, the referent may not be unknown to the reader or to the other characters. For example, (19) There they [the King and his men] saw close beside them a great rubbleheap; and suddenly they were aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease, grey-clad, hardly to be seen among the stones. [Tolkien. The Two Towers, p. 206] The reader knows that the King and his men have come upon two hobbits, Merry and Pippin. The King and his men do not know the hobbits, but other characters also present in the scene do know them. When the King and his men are on the top of the CP (after &apos;saw&apos; and</context>

Cohen (1987)) often exhibited by thoughts might be used to recognize the boundaries of subjective contexts. Branches 2 and 3 of algorithm (Al) need to be expanded to determine who the subjective character is if the actor focus isn&apos;t a reasonable candidate and no parenthetical appears. We are investigating how focus of attention (cf. Grosz (1981), Sidney (1983)) can be incorporated into algorithm (A2) in such a way that anaphoric references reflecting the beliefs of a character can be understood. Finally, there is the general problem of revision. Our algorithms assume that signals occur at the beginning of subjective contexts. However, there are cases when a subjective context cannot be recognized until some of it has already been parsed. A difficult case is illustrated by the following: &amp;quot;Jody was rich and famous. °Why wasn&apos;t she happy?

Branch 3 is taken when the reader cannot identify the subjective character and must read further in the text in order to do so. In this case, an indeterminate, intensional concept is pushed onto the CP. When the reader finally identifies the subjective character, the information that this character and the indeterminate one are co-extensional is built (that is, it is asserted that they are concepts of the same individual; cf. Maida and Shapiro (1982), Shapiro and Rapaport (1987)). Naicong Li (1986) uses this approach in her pronoun resolution algorithm if the information needed to resolve a pronoun is supplied after the pronoun is encountered. Often, the subjective character is identified by a narrative parenthetical, as in the following example: (12) &apos;What was holding Washington up? the colonel asked himself. 124All he needed was a simple yes or no. [Clancy, Red Storm Rising, p. 170] 133 Sentence (12.1) begins with a question, which is a subjective element.

Assertive Indefinite Pronouns. Assertive indefinite pronouns—e.g., &apos;someone&apos;, &apos;something&apos;, &apos;somebody&apos;—are specific, though unspecified (Quirk et al. 1985); that is. they generally refer to particular people, things, etc., without identifying them. When referring to a particular referent, a speaker typically uses an assertive indefinite pronoun if (1) she doesn&apos;t know the identity of the referent, (2) she doesn&apos;t want the addressee to know the identity of the referent, or (3) she doesn&apos;t believe that the identity of the referent is relevant to the conversation. A character&apos;s thoughts and perceptions are not directed toward an addressee, and so the first of these uses is the predominant one in subjective contexts.

This occurs when the head noun is a superordinate, rather than a basic-level, term (Rosch and Lloyd 1978). The basic level is the preferred level at which people identify things. If a superordinate, rather than a basic-level, term appears in an indefinite reference in a subjective context, the reader understands that the subjective character can&apos;t even identify the referent at the basic level. In example (19), the hobbits are referred to as &apos;two small figures&apos;, because the King and his men have never seen hobbits before. Here is an example that is not from a fantasy novel: (20) Slowly Hannah raised her head and blinked her eyes. Small dots of purple covered the ground around her and she reached o</context>

Our algorithm for recognizing the current perspective is a discourse process that looks for the boundaries of subjective contexts.

When a new subjective context is recognized, its 131 subjective character is pushed onto the CP. When the end of a subjective context is recognized, a character is popped from the CP.

Discussion of branch 3. Branch 3 is taken when the reader cannot identify the subjective character and must read further in the text in order to do so. In this case, an indeterminate, intensional concept is pushed onto the CP. When the reader finally identifies the subjective character, the information that this character and the indeterminate one are co-extensional is built (that is, it is asserted that they are concepts of the same individual; cf. Maida and Shapiro (1982), Shapiro and Rapaport (1987)). Naicong Li (1986) uses this approach in her pronoun resolution algorithm if the information needed to resolve a pronoun is supplied after the pronoun is encountered. Often, the subjective character is identified by a narrative parenthetical, as in the following example: (12) &apos;What was holding Washington up? the colonel asked himself. 124All he needed was a simple yes or no. [Clancy, Red Storm Rising, p. 170] 133 Sentence (12.1) begins with a question, which is a subjective element.

Branch 1 is taken when a subjective element continues the current subjective context. For example, the exclamation in (3.2), which is a subjective element, continues the subjective context established by (3.1). The subjective elements &apos;should&apos; and &apos;really&apos; in (5.3) and &apos;After all&apos;, &apos;Aunt Margaret&apos;, &apos;that&apos;, and &apos;ghastly&apos; in (5.4) continue the subjective context established in (5.1). 4.2.2. Discussion of branch 2. The actor focus used in branch 2 is one of the foci that need to be maintained for the comprehension of definite anaphora (Sidner 1983). It is whoever is the agent of the current sentence. (Note that quoted speech has its own foci, which must be maintained separately. In this sense, quoted speech constitutes a separate discourse segment (cf. Grosz and Sidner (1986).) Consider the following example: (10) &amp;quot;11In the kitchen she [Jody] set the basket down on the table. 1°2She put the thermos and the cups in the sink and filled them with cool water to soak. 1°3Then In sane third-person novels, panic:Wady in the 19th century, an overt narrator (Chum= 1978) uses subjective elements.

Since subjective contexts portray thoughts and perceptions, the reader understands that the information they convey reflects the subjective character&apos;s beliefs (cf.

Whatever else the reader may infer that the characters believe, she has to attribute the information in subjective contexts to the subjective character.

A belief space is accessed by a stack of individuals, and consists of what the bottom member of the stack believes that . .. the top member believes. The reader is always the bottom member of the stack, and the belief space corresponding to a stack consisting only of the reader contains the set of 134 propositions that the reader believes are true. All propositions in the knowledge base appear in at least one belief space, and a single proposition can appear in more than one belief space.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH. Many problems remain to be solved. Our discourse process cannot recognize subjective contexts that are not established by the linguistic signals it relies on, and general principles are needed to explain how readers recognize the ending boundaries of subjective contexts. We are investigating how tense, deictic terms (cf. Bruder et al. (1986), &amp;infield (1982)), the characters&apos; goals (cf. Wilensky (1983)), and the argument structure (cf. Cohen (1987)) often exhibited by thoughts might be used to recognize the boundaries of subjective contexts. Branches 2 and 3 of algorithm (Al) need to be expanded to determine who the subjective character is if the actor focus isn&apos;t a reasonable candidate and no parenthetical appears. We are investigating how focus of attention (cf. Grosz (1981), Sidney (1983)) can be incorporated into algorithm (A2) in such a way that anaphoric references reflecting the beliefs of a character can be understood. Finally, there is the general problem of revision. Our algorithm</context>
