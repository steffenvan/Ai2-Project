Unsupervised learning algorithms based
on Expectation Maximization (EM) are
often straightforward to implement and
provably converge on a local likelihood
maximum. However, these algorithms of-
ten do not perform well in practice. Com-
mon wisdom holds that they yield poor
results because they are overly sensitive
to initial parameter values and easily get
stuck in local (but not global) maxima.
We present a series of experiments indi-
cating that for the task of learning sylla-
ble structure, the initial parameter weights
are not crucial. Rather, it is the choice of
model class itself that makes the differ-
ence between successful and unsuccess-
ful learning. We use a language-universal
rule-based algorithm to find a good set of
parameters, and then train the parameter
weights using EM. We achieve word ac-
curacy of 95.9% on German and 97.1% on
English, as compared to 97.4% and 98.1%
respectively for supervised training.

<bodyText confidence="0.999974829268293">
The use of statistical methods in computational lin-
guistics has produced advances in tasks such as pars-
ing, information retrieval, and machine translation.
However, most of the successful work to date has
used supervised learning techniques. Unsupervised
algorithms that can learn from raw linguistic data,
as humans can, remain a challenge. In a statistical
framework, one method that can be used for unsu-
pervised learning is to devise a probabilistic model
of the data, and then choose the values for the model
parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data
under the model.
If the model contains hidden variables, there is
often no closed-form expression for the maximum
likelihood parameter values, and some iterative ap-
proximation method must be used. Expectation
Maximization (EM) (Neal and Hinton, 1998) is
one way to find parameter values that at least lo-
cally maximize the likelihood for models with hid-
den variables. EM is attractive because at each
iteration, the likelihood of the data is guaranteed
not to decrease. In addition, there are efficient
dynamic-programming versions of the EM algo-
rithm for several classes of models that are important
in computational linguistics, such as the forward-
backward algorithm for training Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) and the inside-outside algorithm
for training Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars
(PCFGs).
Despite the advantages of maximum likelihood
estimation and its implementation via various in-
stantiations of the EM algorithm, it is widely re-
garded as ineffective for unsupervised language
learning. Merialdo (1994) showed that with only
a tiny amount of tagged training data, supervised
training of an HMM part-of-speech tagger outper-
formed unsupervised EM training. Later results (e.g.
Brill (1995)) seemed to indicate that other methods
of unsupervised learning could be more effective (al-
though the work of Banko and Moore (2004) sug-
gests that the difference may be far less than previ-

recently achieved more encouraging results using an
EM-like algorithm to induce syntactic constituent
grammars, based on a deficient probability model.
It has been suggested that EM often yield poor
results because it is overly sensitive to initial param-
eter values and tends to converge on likelihood max-
ima that are local, but not global (Carroll and Char-
niak, 1992). In this paper, we present a series of
experiments indicating that for the task of learning
a syllable structure grammar, the initial parameter
weights are not crucial. Rather, it is the choice of
the model class, i.e., the representational bias, that
makes the difference between successful and unsuc-
cessful learning.
In the remainder of this paper, we first describe
the task itself and the structure of the two differ-
ent classes of models we experimented with. We
then present a deterministic algorithm for choosing
a good set of parameters for this task. The algo-
rithm is based on language-universal principles of
syllabification, but produces different parameters for
each language. We apply this algorithm to English
and German data, and describe the results of exper-
iments using EM to learn the parameter weights for
the resulting models. We conclude with a discussion
of the implications of our experiments.

2 Statistical Parsing of Syllable Structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879301587302">
Knowledge of syllable structure is important for
correct pronunciation of spoken words, since cer-
tain phonemes may be pronounced differently de-
pending on their position in the syllable. A num-
ber of different supervised machine learning tech-
niques have been applied to the task of automatic
syllable boundary detection, including decision-tree
classifiers (van den Bosch et al., 1998), weighted
finite state transducers (Kiraz and M¨obius, 1998),
and PCFGs (M¨uller, 2001; M¨uller, 2002). The re-
searchers presenting these systems have generally
argued from the engineering standpoint that sylla-
ble boundary detection is useful for pronunciation of
unknown words in text-to-speech systems. Our mo-
tivation is a more scientific one: we are interested in
the kinds of procedures and representations that can
lead to successful unsupervised language learning in
both computers and humans.
Our work has some similarity to that of M¨uller,
who trains a PCFG of syllable structure from a
corpus of words with syllable boundaries marked.
We, too, use a model defined by a grammar to de-
scribe syllable structure.1 However, our work dif-
fers from M¨uller’s in that it focuses on how to learn
the model’s parameters in an unsupervised manner.
Several researchers have worked on unsupervised
learning of phonotactic constraints and word seg-
mentation (Elman, 2003; Brent, 1999; Venkatara-
man, 2001), but to our knowledge there is no pre-
viously published work on unsupervised learning of
syllable structure.
In the work described here, we experimented with
two different classes of models of syllable structure.
Both of these model classes are presented as PCFGs.
The first model class, described in M¨uller (2002),
encodes information about the positions within a
word or syllable in which each phoneme is likely
to appear. In this positional model, each syllable
is labeled as initial (I), medial (M), final (F), or as
the one syllable in a monosyllabic word (O). Syl-
lables are broken down into an optional onset (the
initial consonant or consonant cluster) followed by a
rhyme. The rhyme consists of a nucleus (the vowel)
followed by an optional coda consonant or cluster.
Each phoneme is labeled with a preterminal cate-
gory of the form CatPos.x.y, where Cat E {Ons,
Nuc, Cod}, Pos E {I, M, F, O}, x is the position
of a consonant within its cluster, and y is the total
number of consonants in the cluster. x and y are un-
used when Cat = Nuc, since all nuclei consist of a
single vowel. See Fig. 1 for an example parse.
Rather than directly encoding positional infor-
mation, the second model class we investigate (the
bigram model) models statistical dependencies be-
tween adjacent phonemes and adjacent syllables.
In particular, each onset or coda expands directly
into one or more terminal phonemes, thus capturing
the ordering dependencies between consonants in a
cluster. Also, the shape of each syllable (whether it
contains an onset or coda) depends on the shape of
the previous syllable, so that the model can learn,
for example, that syllables ending in a coda should
be followed by syllables with an onset.2 This kind

of bigram dependency between syllables is modeled
using rules of the form WdX → SylX WdY, where
X and Y are drawn from the set of possible combi-
nations of onset, nucleus, and coda in a syllable: {N,
ON, NC, ONC}. Each SylX category has only one
expansion. See Fig. 1 for an example.
With respect to either of these two model classes,
each way of assigning syllable boundaries to a word
corresponds to exactly one parse of that word. This
makes it simple to train the models from a corpus in
which syllable boundaries are provided, as in M¨uller
(2001). We used two different corpora for our exper-
iments, one German (from the ECI corpus of news-
paper text) and one English (from the Penn WSJ
corpus). Each corpus was created by converting
the orthographic forms in the original text into their
phonemic transcriptions using the CELEX database
(Baayen et al., 1995). CELEX includes syllable
boundaries, which we used for supervised training
and for evaluation. Any words in the original texts
that were not listed in CELEX were discarded, since
one of our goals is to compare supervised and un-
supervised training.3 From the resulting phonemic
corpora, we created a training set of 20,000 tokens
and a test set of 10,000 tokens. Using standard max-
imum likelihood supervised training procedures, we
obtained similar results for models from the two
model classes. In German, word accuracy (i.e. the
tially ambiguous consonant, such as the b in saber, is always
syllabified as the onset of the second syllable rather than the
coda of the first. We discuss this point further in Section 3.
3Due to the nature of the corpora, the percentage of words
discarded was fairly high: 35.6% of the English tokens (pri-
marily proper nouns, acronyms, and numerals, with a smaller
number of morphologically complex words) and 26.7% of the
German tokens (with compound words making up a somewhat
larger portion of these discards).
percentage of words with no syllabification errors)
was 97.4% for the bigram model and 97.2% for the
positional model,4 while in English it was 98.1%
and 97.6% respectively. These results for English
are in line with previous reported results using other
supervised learning techniques, e.g. van den Bosch
et al. (1998). Since many of the words in the data are
monosyllabic (49.1% in German, 61.2% in English)
and therefore contain no ambiguous syllable bound-
aries, we also calculated the multisyllabic word ac-
curacy. This was 94.9% (bigram) and 94.5% (posi-
tional) in German, and 95.2% (bigram) and 93.8%
(positional) in English.

In the previous section, we described two different
model classes and showed that the maximum like-
lihood estimates with supervised training data yield
good models of syllable structure. In moving to un-
supervised learning, however, there are two prob-
lems that need to be addressed: exactly what class of
models do we want to consider (i.e., what kinds of
rules should the model contain), and how should we
select a particular model from that class (i.e., what
weights should the rules have)? We take as our so-
lution to the latter problem the most straightforward
approach; namely, maximum likelihood estimation
using EM. This leaves us with the question of how
to choose a set of parameters in the first place. In this
section, we describe an algorithm based on two fun-
damental phonological principles that, when given a
set of data from a particular language, will produce a

set of rules appropriate to that language. These rules
can then be trained using EM.
Given a particular rule schema, it is not imme-
diately clear which of the possible rules should ac-
tually be included in the model. For example, in
the bigram model, should we start off with the rule
Ons → k n? This rule is unnecessary for English,
and could lead to incorrect parses of words such
as weakness. But /kn/ is a legal onset in German,
and since we want an algorithm that is prepared to
learn any language, disallowing /kn/ as an onset out
of hand is unacceptable. On the other hand, the set
of all combinatorially possible consonant clusters is
infinite, and even limiting ourselves to clusters actu-
ally seen in the data for a particular language yields
extremely unlikely-sounding onsets like /lkj/ (calcu-
late) and /bst/ (substance). Ideally, we should limit
the set of rules to ones that are likely to actually be
used in the language of interest.
The algorithm we have developed for produc-
ing a set of language-appropriate rules is essentially
a simple categorical (i.e., non-statistical) syllable
parser based on the principles of onset maximiza-
tion and sonority sequencing (Blevins, 1995). Onset
maximization is the idea that in word-medial conso-
nant clusters, as many consonants as possible (given
the phonotactics of the language) should be assigned
to onset position. This idea is widely accepted and
has been codified in Optimality Theory (Prince and
Smolensky, 1993) by proposing the existence of a
universal preference for syllables with onsets.5
In addition to onset maximization, our categorical
parser follows the principle of sonority sequencing
whenever possible. This principle states that, within
a syllable, segments that are closer to the nucleus
should be higher in sonority than segments that are
further away. Vowels are considered to be the most
sonorous segments, followed by glides (/j/, /w/), liq-
uids (/l/, /r/), nasals (/n/, /m/, /q/), fricatives (/v/,
/s/, /T/, ... ), and stops (/b/, /t/, /k/, ... ). Given a
5An important point, which we return to in Section 5, is
that exceptions to onset maximization may occur at morpheme
boundaries. Some linguists also believe that there are addi-
tional exceptions in certain languages (including English and
German), where stressed syllables attract codas. Under this the-
ory, the correct syllabification for saber would not be sa.ber, but
rather sab.er, or possibly sa[b]er, where the [b] is ambisyllabic.
Since the syllable annotations in the CELEX database follow
simple onset maximization, we take that as our approach as well
and do not consider stress when assigning syllable boundaries.
cluster of consonants between two syllable nuclei,
sonority sequencing states that the syllable boundary
should occur either just before or just after the con-
sonant with lowest sonority. Combining this princi-
ple with onset maximization predicts that the bound-
ary should fall before the lowest-sonority segment.
Predicting syllable boundaries in this way is not
foolproof. In some cases, clusters that are predicted
by sonority sequencing to be acceptable are in fact
illegal in some languages. The illegal English on-
set cluster kn is a good example. In other cases,
such as the English onset str, clusters are allowed
despite violating sonority sequencing. These mis-
matches between universal principles and language-
specific phonotactics lead to errors in the predic-
tions of the categorical parser, such as wea.kness and
ins.tru.ment. In addition, certain consonant clusters
like bst (as in substance) may contain more than
one minimum sonority point. To handle these cases,
the categorical parser follows onset maximization
by adding any consonants occurring between the
two minima to the onset of the second syllable:
sub.stance.
Not surprisingly, the categorical parser does not
perform as well as the supervised statistical parser:
only 92.7% of German words and 94.9% of English
words (85.7% and 86.8%, respectively, of multisyl-
labic words) are syllabified correctly. However, a
more important result of parsing the corpus using
the categorical parser is that its output can be used
to define a model class (i.e., a set of PCFG rules)
from which a model can be learned using EM.
Specifically, our model class contains the set of
rules that were proposed at least once by the cat-
egorical parser in its analysis of the training cor-
pus; in the EM experiments described below, the
rule probabilities are initialized to their frequency
in the categorical parser’s output. Due to the mis-
takes made by the categorical parser, there will be
some rules, like Ons → k n in English, that are not
present in the model trained on the true syllabifica-
tion, but many possible but spurious rules, such as
Ons → b s t, will be avoided. Although clusters that
violate sonority sequencing tend to be avoided by
the categorical parser, it does find examples of these
types of clusters at the beginnings and endings of
words, as well as occasionally word-medially (as in
sub.stance). This means that many legal clusters that

the set of rules found by this procedure, although
their probabilities may be considerably lower than

tion, we show that these differences in rule probabil-
ities are unimportant; in fact, it is not the rule prob-
abilities estimated from the categorical parser’s out-
put, but only the set of rules itself that matters for
successful task performance.

In this section, we present a series of experiments us-
ing EM to learn a model of syllable structure. All of
our experiments use the same German and English
20,000-word training corpora and 10,000-word test-
ing corpora as described in Section 2.6
For our first experiment, we ran the categorical
parser on the training corpora and estimated a model
from the parse trees it produced, as described in the
previous section. This is essentially a single step
of Viterbi EM training. We then continued to train
the model by running (standard) EM to convergence.
Results of this experiment with Categorical Pars-
ing + EM (CP + EM) are shown in Tables 1 and
2. For both German and English, using this learn-
ing method with the bigram model yields perfor-
mance that is much better than the categorical parser
alone, though not quite as good as the fully super-
vised regime. On the other hand, training a posi-
tional model from the categorical parser’s output and
then running EM causes performance to degrade.

the bigram model was simply due to good initial-
ization of the parameter weights, we performed a
second experiment. Again starting with the set of
rules output by the categorical parser, we initialized
the rule weights to the uniform distribution. The re-
sults of this experiment (CP-U + EM) show that for
the class of bigram models, the performance of the
final model found by EM does not depend on the
initial rule probabilities. Performance within the po-
sitional model framework does depend on the initial
rule probabilities, since accuracy in German is dif-
ferent for the two experiments.
As we have pointed out, the rules found by the
categorical parser are not exactly the same as the
rules found using supervised training. This raises
the question of whether the difference in perfor-
mance between the unsupervised and supervised bi-
gram models is due to differences in the rules. To
address this question, we performed two additional
experiments. First, we simply ran EM starting from
the model estimated from supervised training data.
Second, we kept the set of rules from the supervised
training data, but reinitialized the probabilities to a
uniform distribution before running EM. The results
of these experiments are shown as SP + EM and SP-
U + EM, respectively. Again, performance of the
bigram model is invariant with respect to initial pa-
rameter values, while the performance of the posi-
tional model is not. Interestingly, the performance
of the bigram model in these two experiments is far
worse than in the CP experiments. This result is
counterintuitive, since it would seem that the model
rules found by the supervised system are the opti-
mal rules for this task. In the following section, we
explain why these rules are not, in fact, the optimal
rules for unsupervised learning, as well as why we
believe the bigram model performs so much better

5 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981619565218">
The results of our experiments raise two interesting
questions. First, when starting from the categorical
parser’s output, why does the bigram model improve
after EM training, while the positional model does
not? And second, why does applying EM to the su-
pervised bigram model lead to worse performance
than applying it to the model induced from the cate-
gorical parser?
To answer the first question, notice that one dif-
ference between the bigram model and the posi-
tional model is that onsets and codas in the bigram
model are modeled using the same set of parame-
ters regardless of where in the word they occur. This
means that the bigram model generalizes whatever it
learns about clusters at word edges to word-medial
clusters (and, of course, vice versa). Since the cate-
gorical parser only makes errors word-medially, in-
correct clusters are only a small percentage of clus-
ters overall, and the bigram model can overcome
these errors by reanalyzing the word-medial clus-
ters. The errors that are made after EM training
are mostly due to overgeneralization from clusters
that are very common at word edges, e.g. predicting
le.gi.sla.tion instead of le.gis.la.tion.
In contrast to the bigram model, the positional
model does not generalize over different positions
of the word, which means that it learns and repeats
the word-medial errors of the categorical parser. For
example, this model predicts /e.gze.kju.tIv/ for ex-
ecutive, just as the categorical parser does, although
/gz/ is never attested in word-initial position. In ad-
dition, each segment in a cluster is generated in-
dependently, which means clusters like /tl/ may be
placed together in an onset because /t/ is common
as the first segment of an onset, and /l/ is common
as the second. While this problem exists even in
the supervised positional model, it is compounded
in the unsupervised version because of the errors of
the categorical parser.
The differences between these two models are an
example of the bias-variance trade-off in probabilis-
tic modeling (Geman et al., 1992): models with low
bias will be able to fit a broad range of observations
fairly closely, but slight changes in the observed data
will cause relatively large changes in the induced
model. On the other hand, models with high bias
are less sensitive to changes in the observed data.
Here, the bigram model induced from the categor-
ical parser has a relatively high bias: regardless of
the parameter weights, it will be a poor model of
data where word-medial onsets and codas are very
different from those at word edges, and it cannot
model data with certain onsets such as /vp/ or /tz/
at all because the rules Ons → v p and Ons → t z
are simply absent. The induced positional model
can model both of these situations, and can fit the
true parses more closely as well (as evidenced by
the fact that the likelihood of the data under the su-
pervised positional model is higher than the like-
lihood under the supervised bigram model). As a
result, however, it is more sensitive to the initial
parameter weights and learns to recreate the errors
produced by the categorical parser. This sensitiv-
ity to initial parameter weights also explains the ex-
tremely poor performance of the positional model
in the SP-U + EM experiment on English. Because
the model is so unconstrained, in this case it finds a
completely different local maximum (not the global
maximum) which more or less follows coda max-
imization rather than onset maximization, yielding
syllabifications like synd.ic.ate and tent.at.ive.ly.
The concept of representational bias can also ex-
plain why applying EM to the supervised bigram
model performs so poorly. Examining the model in-
duced from the categorical parser reveals that, not
surprisingly, it contains more rules than the super-
vised bigram model. This is because the categori-
cal parser produces a wider range of onsets and co-
das than there are in the true parses. However, the
induced model is not a superset of the supervised
model. There are four rules (three in English) that
occur in the supervised model but not the induced
model. These are the rules that allow words where
one syllable contains a coda and the following syl-
lable has no onset. These are never produced by the
categorical parser because of its onset-maximization
principle. However, it turns out that a very small per-
centage of words do follow this pattern (about .14%
of English tokens and 1.1% of German tokens). In
English, these examples seem to consist entirely of
words where the unusual syllable boundary occurs at
a morpheme boundary (e.g. un.usually, dis.appoint,

week.end, turn.over). In German, all but a handful of
examples occur at morpheme boundaries as well.7
The fact that the induced bigram model is unable
to model words with codas followed by no onset is
a very strong bias, but these words are so infrequent
that the model can still fit the data quite well. The
missing rules have no effect on the accuracy of the
parser, because in the supervised model the proba-
bilities on the rules allowing these kinds of words
are so low that they are never used in the Viterbi
parses anyway. The problem is that if these rules are
included in the model prior to running EM, they add
several extra free parameters, and suddenly EM is
able to reanalyze many of the words in the corpus to
make better use of these parameters. It ends up pre-
ferring certain segments and clusters as onsets and
others as codas, which raises the likelihood of the
corpus but leads to very poor performance. Essen-
tially, it seems that the presence of a certain kind of
morpheme boundary is an additional parameter of
the “true” model that the bigram model doesn’t in-
clude. Trying to account for the few cases where this
parameter matters requires introducing extra param-
eters that allow EM too much freedom of analysis.
It is far better to constrain the model, disallowing
certain rare analyses but enabling the model to learn
successfully in a way that is robust to variations in
initial conditions and idiosyncracies of the data.

6 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.998192771428571">
We make no claims that our learning system em-
bodies a complete model of syllabification. A full
model would need to account for the effects of mor-
phological boundaries, as well as the fact that some
languages allow resyllabification over word bound-
aries. Nevertheless, we feel that the results presented
here are significant. We have shown that, despite
previous discouraging results (Carroll and Charniak,
1992; Merialdo, 1994), it is possible to achieve good
results using EM to learn linguistic structures in an
unsupervised way. However, the choice of model
parameters is crucial for successful learning. Car-
roll and Charniak, for example, generated all pos-

sen’, erobern ‘capture’, and forms of erinnern ‘remind’, all of
which were listed in CELEX as having a syllable boundary, but

edge of German is not sufficient to determine whether there is
some other factor that can explain these cases.
sible rules within a particular framework and relied
on EM to remove the “unnecessary” rules by letting
their probabilities go to zero. We suggest that this
procedure tends to yield models with low bias but
high variance, so that they are extremely sensitive
to the small variations in expected rule counts that
occur with different initialization weights.
Our work suggests that using models with higher
bias but lower variance may lead to much more
successful results. In particular, we used univer-
sal phonological principles to induce a set of rules
within a carefully chosen grammatical framework.
We found that there were several factors that en-
abled our induced bigram model to learn success-
fully where the comparison positional model did
not:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7139919">
1. The bigram model encodes bigram dependen-
cies of syllable shape and disallows onset-less
syllables following syllables with codas.
2. The bigram model does not distinguish be-
tween different positions in a word, so it can
generalize onset and coda sequences from word
edges to word-medial position.
3. The bigram model learns specific sequences
of legal clusters rather than information about
which positions segments are likely to occur in.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998175">
Notice that each of these factors imposes a con-
straint on the kinds of data that can be modeled. We
have already discussed the fact that item 1 rules out
the correct syllabification of certain morphologically
complex words, but since our system currently has
no way to determine morpheme boundaries, it is bet-
ter to do so than to introduce extra free parameters.
One possible extension to this work would be to try
to incorporate morphological boundary information
(either annotated or induced) into the model.
A more interesting constraint is the one imposed
by item 2, since in fact most languages do have some
differences between the onsets and (especially) co-
das allowed at word edges and within words. How-
ever, the proper way to handle this fact is not by
introducing completely independent parameters for
initial, medial, and final positions, since this allows
far too much freedom. It would be extremely sur-
prising to find a language with one set of codas al-
lowed word-internally, and a completely disjoint set

allowed word-finally. In fact, the usual situation is
that word-internal onsets and codas are a subset of
those allowed at word edges, and this is exactly why
using word edges to induce our rules was successful.
Considering language more broadly, it is com-
mon to find patterns of linguistic phenomena with
many similarities but some differences as well. For
such cases, adding extra parameters to a supervised
model often yields better performance, since the
augmented model can capture both primary and sec-
ondary effects. But it seems that, at least for the
current state of unsupervised learning, it is better to
limit the number of parameters and focus on those
that capture the main effects in the data. In our task
of learning syllable structure, we were able to use
just a few simple principles to constrain the model
successfully. For more complex tasks such as syn-
tactic parsing, the space of linguistically plausible
models is much larger. We feel that a research pro-
gram integrating results from the study of linguistic
universals, human language acquisition, and compu-
tational modeling is likely to yield the most insight
into the kinds of constraints that are needed for suc-
cessful learning.
Ultimately, of course, we will want to be able to
capture not only the main effects in the data, but
some of the subtler effects as well. However, we
believe that the way to do this is not by introducing
completely free parameters, but by using a Bayesian
prior that would enforce a degree of similarity be-
tween certain parameters. In the meantime, we have
shown that employing linguistic universals to deter-
mine which set of parameters to include in a lan-
guage model for syllable parsing allows us to use
EM for learning the parameter weights in a success-
ful and robust way.

<abstract confidence="0.996428416666666">Unsupervised learning algorithms based on Expectation Maximization (EM) are often straightforward to implement and provably converge on a local likelihood maximum. However, these algorithms often do not perform well in practice. Common wisdom holds that they yield poor results because they are overly sensitive to initial parameter values and easily get stuck in local (but not global) maxima. We present a series of experiments indicating that for the task of learning syllable structure, the initial parameter weights are not crucial. Rather, it is the choice of model class itself that makes the difference between successful and unsuccessful learning. We use a language-universal rule-based algorithm to find a good set of parameters, and then train the parameter weights using EM. We achieve word accuracy of 95.9% on German and 97.1% on English, as compared to 97.4% and 98.1% respectively for supervised training.</abstract>

With respect to either of these two model classes, each way of assigning syllable boundaries to a word corresponds to exactly one parse of that word. This makes it simple to train the models from a corpus in which syllable boundaries are provided, as in M¨uller (2001). We used two different corpora for our experiments, one German (from the ECI corpus of newspaper text) and one English (from the Penn WSJ corpus). Each corpus was created by converting the orthographic forms in the original text into their phonemic transcriptions using the CELEX database (Baayen et al., 1995). CELEX includes syllable boundaries, which we used for supervised training and for evaluation. Any words in the original texts that were not listed in CELEX were discarded, since one of our goals is to compare supervised and unsupervised training.3 From the resulting phonemic corpora, we created a training set of 20,000 tokens and a test set of 10,000 tokens. Using standard maximum likelihood supervised training procedures, we obtained similar results for models from the two model classes.

Ideally, we should limit the set of rules to ones that are likely to actually be used in the language of interest. The algorithm we have developed for producing a set of language-appropriate rules is essentially a simple categorical (i.e., non-statistical) syllable parser based on the principles of onset maximization and sonority sequencing (Blevins, 1995). Onset maximization is the idea that in word-medial consonant clusters, as many consonants as possible (given the phonotactics of the language) should be assigned to onset position. This idea is widely accepted and has been codified in Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 1993) by proposing the existence of a universal preference for syllables with onsets.5 In addition to onset maximization, our categorical parser follows the principle of sonority sequencing whenever possible. This principle states that, within a syllable, segments that are closer to the nucleus should be higher in sonori</context>

In addition, each segment in a cluster is generated independently, which means clusters like /tl/ may be placed together in an onset because /t/ is common as the first segment of an onset, and /l/ is common as the second. While this problem exists even in the supervised positional model, it is compounded in the unsupervised version because of the errors of the categorical parser. The differences between these two models are an example of the bias-variance trade-off in probabilistic modeling (Geman et al., 1992): models with low bias will be able to fit a broad range of observations fairly closely, but slight changes in the observed data will cause relatively large changes in the induced model. On the other hand, models with high bias are less sensitive to changes in the observed data.

Merialdo (1994) showed that with only a tiny amount of tagged training data, supervised training of an HMM part-of-speech tagger outperformed unsupervised EM training. Later results (e.g. Brill (1995)) seemed to indicate that other methods of unsupervised learning could be more effective (although the work of Banko and Moore (2004) suggests that the difference may be far less than previ112 Proceedings of the 9th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 112–119, Ann Arbor, June 2005. c�2005 Association for Computational Linguistics ously assumed).

A full model would need to account for the effects of morphological boundaries, as well as the fact that some languages allow resyllabification over word boundaries. Nevertheless, we feel that the results presented here are significant. We have shown that, despite previous discouraging results (Carroll and Charniak, 1992; Merialdo, 1994), it is possible to achieve good results using EM to learn linguistic structures in an unsupervised way. However, the choice of model parameters is crucial for successful learning. Carroll and Charniak, for example, generated all pos7The exceptions in our training data were auserkoren ‘chosen’, erobern ‘capture’, and forms of erinnern ‘remind’, all of which were listed in CELEX as having a syllable boundary, but no morpheme boundary, after the first consonant.

Unsupervised algorithms that can learn from raw linguistic data, as humans can, remain a challenge. In a statistical framework, one method that can be used for unsupervised learning is to devise a probabilistic model of the data, and then choose the values for the model parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data under the model. If the model contains hidden variables, there is often no closed-form expression for the maximum likelihood parameter values, and some iterative approximation method must be used. Expectation Maximization (EM) (Neal and Hinton, 1998) is one way to find parameter values that at least locally maximize the likelihood for models with hidden variables. EM is attractive because at each iteration, the likelihood of the data is guaranteed not to decrease.

The algorithm we have developed for producing a set of language-appropriate rules is essentially a simple categorical (i.e., non-statistical) syllable parser based on the principles of onset maximization and sonority sequencing (Blevins, 1995). Onset maximization is the idea that in word-medial consonant clusters, as many consonants as possible (given the phonotactics of the language) should be assigned to onset position. This idea is widely accepted and has been codified in Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 1993) by proposing the existence of a universal preference for syllables with onsets.5 In addition to onset maximization, our categorical parser follows the principle of sonority sequencing whenever possible. This principle states that, within a syllable, segments that are closer to the nucleus should be higher in sonority than segments that are further away. Vowels are considered to be the most sonorous segments, followed by glides (/j/, /w/), liquids (/l/, /r/), nasals (/n/, /m/, /q/), fricatives (/v/, /s/, /T/, ... ), and stops (/b/, /t/, /k/, ... ).

Our work has some similarity to that of M¨uller, who trains a PCFG of syllable structure from a corpus of words with syllable boundaries marked. We, too, use a model defined by a grammar to describe syllable structure.1 However, our work differs from M¨uller’s in that it focuses on how to learn the model’s parameters in an unsupervised manner. Several researchers have worked on unsupervised learning of phonotactic constraints and word segmentation (Elman, 2003; Brent, 1999; Venkataraman, 2001), but to our knowledge there is no previously published work on unsupervised learning of syllable structure. In the work described here, we experimented with two different classes of models of syllable structure. Both of these model classes are presented as PCFGs. The first model class, described in M¨uller (2002), encodes information about the positions within a word or syllable in which each phoneme is likely to appear. In this positional model, each syllable is labeled as initial (I), medial (M), final (F), or as the one syllable in a monosyllabic word (O). Syllables are broken down into an</context>
