<bodyText confidence="0.573499230769231">
This paper presents problems and solutions in
developing Thai National Corpus (TNC). TNC
is designed to be a comparable corpus of Brit-
ish National Corpus. The project aims to col-
lect eighty million words. Since 2006, the
project can now collect only fourteen million
words. The data is accessible from the TNC
Web. Delay in creating the TNC is mainly
caused from obtaining authorization of copy-
right texts. Methods used for collecting data
and the results are discussed. Errors during the
process of encoding data and how to handle
these errors will be described.

1 Thai National Corpus
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.996292967741936">
Thai National Corpus (TNC) is a general corpus
of the standard Thai language (Aroonmanakun,
2007 ). 1t is designed to be comparable to the
British National Corpus (Aston and Burnard,
1998 ) in terms of its domain and medium propor-
tions. However, only written texts are collected
in the TNC, and the corpus size is targeted at
eighty million words. 1n addition to domain and
medium criteria, texts are also selected and cate-
gorized on the basis of their genres. We adopted
Lee&apos;s idea of categorizing texts into different
genres based on external factors like the purpose
of communication, participants, and the settings
of communication (Lee 2001 ). Texts in the same
genre share the same characteristics of language
usages, e.g. discourse structure, sentence pat-
terns, etc. Moreover, since TNC is a representa-
tive of the standard Thai language at present,
90% of the texts will be texts produced before
1998. The rest 10% can be texts produced before
1998 if they are published recently. Therefore,
the structure of TNC is shaped on the dimensions
of domain, medium, genres and time (see Table
1 ). Texts that fit into the designed portion of
these criteria will be selected. After that, copy-
right holders of each text will be contacted and
asked to sign a permission form. To make this
process easier, the same form is used for all cop-
yright holders. When authorization is granted,
texts are randomly selected either from the be-
ginning, the middle, the end, or selected from
many sections. Sampling size can vary, but the
maximum size will not exceed 40,000 words or
about 80 pages of A4 paper.
1n this TNC project, we use the TE1 guideline,
&amp;quot;TE1 P4&amp;quot;, as the markup language. Three types
of information are marked in the document: do-
cumentation of encoded data, primary data, and
linguistic annotation. Documentation of encoded
data is the markup used for contextual informa-
tion about the text. Primary data refers to the ba-
sic elements in the text, such as paragraphs, sec-
tions, sentences, etc. Linguistic annotation is the
markup used for linguistic analysis, such as parts
of speech, sentence structures, etc. The first two
types are the minimum requirements for marking
up texts. The structure of each document is
represented in the following tags:
&lt;tncDoc xml:id=&amp;quot;DocName&amp;quot;&gt;
&lt;tncHeader&gt; ...markup for contextual informa-
tion ...
&lt;/tncHeader&gt;
&lt;text&gt; ...body text, markup for primary data e.g.
&lt;p&gt; and linguistic analysis e.g. &lt;w&gt;, &lt;name&gt;
....
&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/tncDoc&gt;
For linguistic annotation, we mark word
boundaries and transcriptions for every word.
1nformation of parts-of-speech will not be
marked at present. The following is an example
of markup in a document.

We recognize that marking tags manually is a
difficult and a time-consuming task, so for this
project, two programs are used for tagging lan-
guage data and contextual information. TNC
Tagger is used for segmenting words and mark-
ing basic tags &lt;w&gt; and &lt;p&gt; in the text. Word
segmentation and transcription program pro-
posed in Aroonmanakun and Rivepiboon (2004)
is used as a tagger. TNC Header is used for in-
putting contextual information and generating
header tag for each text. Output from TNC Tag-
ger will be combined with the header tag as an
XML document.

2 Data collection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995593670454546">
This section explains methods of data collection
and the outcomes. First, we thought that texts
could be collected easily from publishers. So, we
first wrote a letter to three major publishers ask-
ing for collaboration. We thought that they
would be able to provide us lot of texts in elec-
tronic formats. So, we asked them to give us a
list of their publications and mark for us items
that they have in electronic forms. 1t turned out
that they did not even understand much about the
corpus and the purpose of collecting texts. Thus,
we did not receive positive responses as ex-
pected. Only one publisher was able to give us
the list of their publications. The rest asked us to
be more specific about the texts we want. The
fault is ours because we did not make clear what
texts that we want and how their rights on the
texts will be protected. Thus, corresponding with
the publishers did not go smoothly and quickly
as it should be. We also learned that the publish-
ers are not the owners of all the texts. 1t depends
on the agreement signed between the authors and
the publishers. Normally, the author is the copy-
right holder. Publishers may hold the copyright
for a certain period agreed by both parties.
Later, before we wrote to a publisher asking
for their helps, we searched and listed the title
and the number of pages that we want from each
text. Project details and samples of concordance
output were enclosed to give them a better un-
derstanding of the project. And we only asked
the publishers to collaborate by providing us the
contact address of the copyright holder of each
text. This time we received a positive response
from many publishers. From twenty two publish-
ers we contacted, only one publisher officially
refused to collaborate for their own reasons.
Fourteen publishers did not response. Seven of
them sent us the information we requested. After
we received the contact addresses from the pub-
lishers, we then wrote a letter directly to the au-
thor. A permission form in which selected publi-
cations are listed was attached in the letter. We
asked them to sign a permission form and return
it in the enclosed envelope. To make them feel
easier to support us, we informed them that they
may remove their works from the TNC anytime
by writing a letter informing us to do so. We did
not even ask for a copy of the book or the article.
We will look for those texts and typing them in
ourselves. By doing this, we did not put a burden
on the copyright owners. 1n addition, we con-
tacted the P.E.N 1nternational-Thailand Centre,
which is the association of publishers, editors,
and novelists in Thailand, asking for contact ad-
dresses of novelists. For academic writers, we
searched for their contact addresses from univer-
sity websites. Of those 780 authors we had con-
tacted, 250 of them granted us the permission to
use their texts. We suspected that the address list
we received from the P.E.N 1nternational-
Thailand Centre may be out-of-date because we
received only 41 replies from 278 requests to
novelists.
For texts that are not copyrighted in Thai, e.g.
news reports, documents from governments,
laws and orders etc., they are collected prefera-
bly from those that are available in the internet.
After texts were saved in electronic format
and catalogued in the database, they were parsed
by the TNC Tagger program. Texts will be word
segmented and marked basic tags as described in
the previous section. The process is not fully au-
tomatic. The program will ask a user to make a
correction if any chunk of texts could not be
parsed. This usually happened because there was
a spelling error within that text chunk. After the
text is parsed, contextual information of the text
will be inserted by using the TNC Header pro-
gram. With these two programs, texts are con-
verted into an XML format that conforms to the
TE1 P4 standard. Some problems occurred dur-
ing this process will be discuss in section 4.
TNC web
1t is now clear that collecting eighty million
words is a long time process. At present, only
fourteen million words are processed in the TNC.
Nevertheless, it is a good idea to make the corpus
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.932263">
154
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977190476191">
accessible to the public. So, we had been devel-
oping a web interface to search the TNC, or the
TNC web1.
TNC web is a web interface for concordance
software that will show not only keyword-in-
context but also collocations and distributions of
the keyword. When users enter a keyword, the
distribution of keyword in five major genres will
be shown on the right window. Users can click
on the frequency of occurrence in any genre on
this window. A concordance window will then
be displayed underneath. Users can filter the
search by specifying a genre, a domain, pub-
lished year, authors&apos; age range, and authors&apos;
gender. By doing this, users can search for the
occurrence of the keyword in any specific con-
text. Figure 1 shows the screen of concordance
search from TNC web.
Collocation is searched by clicking on the icon
&amp;quot;COLLOCATE&amp;quot;. Collocations within 1-3 words
on the left and right contexts will be ranked by
statistical measure. Frequency of occurrence in
five major genres will also be shown. Users can
click on these numbers to see the concordance
context. Figures 2 and 3 shows the collocation of
the keyword ;Jw — `run&apos; using log-likelihood and
mutual information.
To make the processing time acceptable, the
XML data was converted into MySQL database
and PHP scripting language was used for web
development. Co-occurrences of words are also
stored as precache data. By doing this, the size of
the data storage gets larger. The XML data of 14
million words, which is about 365 megabytes, is
expanded to 2,064 megabytes on the server.
Though at present, the TNC is not balance and
does not have a proportion of texts as planned,
making it searchable through the web is still a
useful idea. Users can get authentic data in vari-
ous genres. And it would be easier for us to ex-
plain to the public what the TNC is and how it
can be used.

4 Problems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898166666667">
The difficulties of creating the TNC are
grounded on management rather than technical
problems. The most difficult part is to get copy-
right texts. Unexpected errors during the process
of creating an annotation text are also another
problem causing a delay in creating the TNC.

4.1 Getting more texts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999740363636364">
Though the use of corpora is quite well known to
academics, it is little known to the public at
large. Without understanding from the people
especially writers and publishers, it is not easy to
get the support and collaboration from them.
This is the main obstruction causing a delay in
creating the TNC. 1mplementing TNC web is one
method of getting TNC known to the public.
Another strategy that we plan to do is to public-
ize the project and praise those who contributed
their texts to the project. At this moment, a num-
ber of famous novelists had granted us the per-
mission to include parts of their novels in the
TNC. We could use these names to make other
people feel that it is a privilege to have their texts
as a part of TNC.
Another strategy of promoting TNC is to
show its worth. We plan to publish a series of
linguistic papers that use TNC as data of analy-
sis, and demonstrate how basic information like
word frequency and collocations in different ge-
nres can be used for teaching the Thai language.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999748">
4.2 Validating data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985448275862">
The delay in creating the TNC is also caused
during the process of encoding data. As stated
earlier in section 2, texts have to be parsed and
encoded as XML data. During this process, dif-
ferent types of errors are found. These have to be
handled to make the data correct and consistent.
System errors (unintentional): This is an unin-
tentional typo that produces an ill-formed string.
These errors are easier to detect and most people
would agree that they should be corrected. For
example, snaaauaa4, is ill-formed because a conso-
nant character is missing after to . This string
cannot be parsed and read. 1t should be edited as
oar, `car, broken, this morning&apos;.
System errors (intentional): This is an inten-
tional typo that produces an ill-formed string.
Even if the string produced from this type is ill-
formed with respect to orthography rules, they
are written intentionally to intensify meaning.
For example, rnกกกกก !`difficult&apos; is a word in which
the last consonant is repeated to intensify the de-
gree of difficulty.
Hidden errors: This is also an unintentional
typo error because the actual text should be
something else. But the error does not produce
an ill-formed string. The string can be parsed and
readable. But its meaning could be strange be-
cause the actual word is mistaken as another
word. For example, the phrase anvrnirwnuu is well-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.988767173076924">
formed because it can be read as four words in &amp;quot;1
กtm nuu, `car, grandfather, middle, street&apos;. But its
meaning is anomalous. Thus, it should be
changed to in orej nnra nuu, `car, broken, middle,
street&apos; - `the car was broken in the middle of the
street. This type of error is called &amp;quot;hidden error&amp;quot;
because it could not be detected by simply apply-
ing orthography rules. To correct this type of
error, manual editing might be required.
Variation of writing: This type is not exactly
an error. 1t is a variation of written form pro-
duced by different authors. From a prescriptive
view, it could be viewed as an error and should
be corrected. Some variations are a result of the
lack of knowledge in spelling. For example,
some people write the word #nกl$%&amp;�&amp;quot;a&apos; `globaliza-
tion&apos; incorrectly as #nกl$%&amp;�(u&apos;. Some write the word
that does not conform to orthographic rules, e.g.
)*�+, which should be written as )*+ `buzzing&apos;. 1t is
possible that they do not know how to spell these
words, which makes it an unintentional error.
Preserving these errors would provide us authen-
tic information, which will be very useful for
studying spelling problems. Nevertheless, since
the TNC is expected to be a reference of Thai
language usages, keeping these variations could
confuse users who want to know the correct or
standard form of writing. Therefore, these varia-
tions should be corrected and removed from the
TNC. However, these variations will be saved in
an error log file for further use of spelling prob-
lems.2
However, we do not think that all variations of
writing are errors. Variations caused by different
transliteration methods should be kept as they
are. When transliterating foreign words, it is like-
ly that they are written differently despite the fact
that a guideline for transliteration to Thai has
been proposed by the Royal 1nstitute. For exam-
ple, the word &amp;quot;internet&amp;quot; is found written as
variations are not seen as errors and therefore are
not modified.
Segmentation errors: These are errors caused
by the segmentation program. 1t is likely that the
program would segment proper names incorrect-
ly. For example, the name 1J1P1&amp;�ari ก��-uteis. is seg-
mented as &lt;w tran=&amp;quot;naaj0&amp;quot;&gt;„1r,&lt;/w&gt;&lt;w
tran=&amp;quot;wan0&amp;quot;&gt;&amp;�„&lt;/w&gt;&lt;w tran=&amp;quot;chaj0&amp;quot;&gt;;r,&lt;/w&gt;

this suggestion.

&lt;/w&gt;&lt;w tran=&amp;quot;wan0chaj0&amp;quot;&gt;&amp;~„;r,&lt;/w&gt; &lt;w
tran=&amp;quot;kuu2prals@@tl&amp;quot;&gt;ก��-i-.ieis.&lt;/w&gt;. A Thai
named entity recognition module is needed to
handle this problem. But before the module is
included in the TNC tagger, these errors have to
be manually corrected.
To correct errors caused by typos, we could
compare the same text typed by two typists. But
this method would double the expense of typing.
Therefore, we seek to detect typos indirectly by
using the TNC Tagger program. Basically, the
program will segment words in the text. 1f a typo
causes an ill-formed character sequence, the pro-
gram will fail to segment that character se-
quence. Then, a pop-up screen asking for a cor-
rection of that string sequence will appear. 1f it is
an unintentional system error, the correct word
will be typed in. 1f it is an intentional system er-
ror, the intentionally incorrect word will be
tagged manually. After the program finishes
segmenting words, the program will create a list
of unknown words (words that are not found in
the dictionary) and words that occur only once in
the file. This word list will be used by the TNC
Editor program for spotting errors that are not
typos. TNC Editor will be used for manually
editing the document, especially the hidden, var-
iation, and segmentation errors.
4. 3 Obtaining authorization
Acquiring permission from the copyright holders
is a time consuming process. We once thought of
a way to use copyright text under a condition of
&amp;quot;fair use&amp;quot; stated in the copyright protection act in
Thailand. According to the act, any writing is
automatically protected by the law throughout
the life of the creator plus fifty years after the
author dies. However, some works are not copy-
righted, such as news reports which are facts ra-
ther than opinions; constitution and laws; rules,
regulation, reports or documents issued by gov-
ernment organizations, etc.
On section 32 of the copyright protection act,
certain uses of copyright materials are not consi-
dered a violation of copyright law, such as mak-
ing a copy of text for research purpose without
making a profit, making a copy for private use,
for criticism with an acknowledgement of the
writer, for teaching or educational purpose with-
out making a profit, etc. But all these activities
must not affect the benefits that the copyright
holders should have received from their works.

1n addition, on section 33, it is stated that a rea-
sonable and acceptable part of a copyright work
can be copied or cited if the copyright owner is
acknowledged. Therefore, we had consulted an
eminent law firm whether our project can make
use of these exceptions of the Thai copyright
law. 1s it possible to argue that the texts we col-
lected are used for educational/research purpose
and no profit is generated from the TNC? 1n ad-
dition, users can see the bibliographic reference
of each concordance line. Thus, is it possible to
conclude that our uses of copyright texts are un-
der the condition of &amp;quot;fair use&amp;quot;? However, the
lawyers thought that we cannot use those argu-
mentations since the text size we collected could
be up to 40,000 words. Although the reference to
the source text is shown to the users, the text
length is greater than acceptable level. The TNC
project is the project for creating a new database.
Texts collected in this project are not used for
criticism or for the study of those texts per se.
Our activity in collecting copyright texts could
affect the benefits the copyright holder should
have. Thus, the creation of a corpus is not under
the conditions of sections 32 and 33. At the end,
the law firm advised us to continue asking for
authorization from the copyright holder as we
have been doing.

5 Future plan
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992692307692">
We plan to run three tasks concurrently: clean-
ing up data, expanding data, and utilizing the
corpus. For cleaning up data, Thai named entity
recognition module will be implemented to re-
duce errors of word segmentation. But at the end,
TNC Editor is needed to clean up segmented data
manually. The program is now under develop-
ment by 1BM Thailand Co.,Ltd. For expanding
data, more publishers and writers are being con-
tacted. Copyright texts are now constantly being
added into the corpus. But to increase the growth
rate of the corpus size, we would prefer to have
people submitting their works themselves. We
hope that by making the corpus searchable online
and revealing famous writers who had contri-
buted their works will make people feel that it is
the prestige to have their works included in the
corpus. 1t remains to be seen whether our plan to
publicize the TNC project will be successful.
And finally, to increase the worth of TNC, we
will encourage linguists to use TNC as the basis
of Thai language studies. Basic facts like word
lists in different genres will be released. We also
hope that new Thai language resources like dic-
tionaries and grammar books could be produced
based on the actual usages found in the TNC.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98837528125">
1n this paper we described the current status of
the TNC project and the problems causing the
delay of collecting data. The future work will
still be focused on collecting more texts, both
copyright and non-copyright material. We hope
to fill the TNC with texts according to the de-
signed proportion in the dimensions of domain,
medium, and genres. We hope that our publiciz-
ing plan, making the TNC known to the public
and praising those who contributed their texts,
would easy the process of text collection.
Given that there are a huge number of texts
available on the internet, it would be easier to
collect texts from the internet without going
through the process of obtaining authorization
from the copyright holders. 1n fact, many corpora
have been collected directly from the web (Baro-
ni and Ueyama, 2006; Fletcher, 2007 ), or the
web itself has been used as a corpus (Killgarriff
and Grefenstettey, 2003 ). 1t might be true that
natural language processing research can use
web as data source for their works effectively.
Nevertheless, we think that by getting authoriza-
tion from text owners, we could fully distribute
the source data. And this is necessary for linguis-
tic analysis. 1n addition, by manually selecting
and categorizing data to be included in the cor-
pus, users can look for similarity and difference
between different text settings. Therefore, we
believe that the creation of TNC will still be
fruitful for research especially on Thai linguistic
analysis.

<abstract confidence="0.995098500994037">This paper presents problems and solutions in developing Thai National Corpus (TNC). TNC is designed to be a comparable corpus of British National Corpus. The project aims to collect eighty million words. Since 2006, the project can now collect only fourteen million words. The data is accessible from the TNC Web. Delay in creating the TNC is mainly caused from obtaining authorization of copyright texts. Methods used for collecting data and the results are discussed. Errors during the process of encoding data and how to handle these errors will be described. 1 Thai National Corpus Thai National Corpus (TNC) is a general corpus of the standard Thai language (Aroonmanakun, 2007 ). 1t is designed to be comparable to the British National Corpus (Aston and Burnard, 1998 ) in terms of its domain and medium proportions. However, only written texts are collected in the TNC, and the corpus size is targeted at eighty million words. 1n addition to domain and medium criteria, texts are also selected and categorized on the basis of their genres. We adopted Lee&apos;s idea of categorizing texts into different genres based on external factors like the purpose of communication, participants, and the settings of communication (Lee 2001 ). Texts in the same genre share the same characteristics of language usages, e.g. discourse structure, sentence patterns, etc. Moreover, since TNC is a representative of the standard Thai language at present, 90% of the texts will be texts produced before 1998. The rest 10% can be texts produced before 1998 if they are published recently. Therefore, the structure of TNC is shaped on the dimensions of domain, medium, genres and time (see Table 1 ). Texts that fit into the designed portion of these criteria will be selected. After that, copyright holders of each text will be contacted and asked to sign a permission form. To make this process easier, the same form is used for all copyright holders. When authorization is granted, texts are randomly selected either from the beginning, the middle, the end, or selected from many sections. Sampling size can vary, but the maximum size will not exceed 40,000 words or about 80 pages of A4 paper. 1n this TNC project, we use the TE1 guideline, &amp;quot;TE1 P4&amp;quot;, as the markup language. Three types of information are marked in the document: documentation of encoded data, primary data, and linguistic annotation. Documentation of encoded data is the markup used for contextual information about the text. Primary data refers to the basic elements in the text, such as paragraphs, sections, sentences, etc. Linguistic annotation is the markup used for linguistic analysis, such as parts of speech, sentence structures, etc. The first two types are the minimum requirements for marking up texts. The structure of each document is represented in the following tags: &lt;tncDoc xml:id=&amp;quot;DocName&amp;quot;&gt; ...markup for contextual information &lt;/tncHeader&gt; &lt;text&gt; ...body text, markup for primary data e.g. &lt;p&gt; and linguistic analysis e.g. &lt;w&gt;, &lt;name&gt; .... &lt;/text&gt; &lt;/tncDoc&gt; For linguistic annotation, we mark word boundaries and transcriptions for every word. 1nformation of parts-of-speech will not be marked at present. The following is an example of markup in a document. &lt;w&gt;3&lt;/w&gt; &lt;w 153 of the 7th Workshop on Asian Language Resources, ACL-IJCNLP pages Singapore, 6-7 August 2009. ACL and AFNLP tran=&amp;quot;jaaN1&amp;quot;&gt; We recognize that marking tags manually is a difficult and a time-consuming task, so for this project, two programs are used for tagging language data and contextual information. TNC Tagger is used for segmenting words and marking basic tags &lt;w&gt; and &lt;p&gt; in the text. Word segmentation and transcription program proposed in Aroonmanakun and Rivepiboon (2004) is used as a tagger. TNC Header is used for inputting contextual information and generating header tag for each text. Output from TNC Tagger will be combined with the header tag as an XML document. 2 Data collection This section explains methods of data collection and the outcomes. First, we thought that texts could be collected easily from publishers. So, we first wrote a letter to three major publishers asking for collaboration. We thought that they would be able to provide us lot of texts in electronic formats. So, we asked them to give us a list of their publications and mark for us items that they have in electronic forms. 1t turned out that they did not even understand much about the corpus and the purpose of collecting texts. Thus, we did not receive positive responses as expected. Only one publisher was able to give us the list of their publications. The rest asked us to be more specific about the texts we want. The fault is ours because we did not make clear what texts that we want and how their rights on the texts will be protected. Thus, corresponding with the publishers did not go smoothly and quickly as it should be. We also learned that the publishers are not the owners of all the texts. 1t depends on the agreement signed between the authors and the publishers. Normally, the author is the copyright holder. Publishers may hold the copyright for a certain period agreed by both parties. Later, before we wrote to a publisher asking for their helps, we searched and listed the title and the number of pages that we want from each text. Project details and samples of concordance output were enclosed to give them a better understanding of the project. And we only asked the publishers to collaborate by providing us the contact address of the copyright holder of each text. This time we received a positive response from many publishers. From twenty two publishers we contacted, only one publisher officially refused to collaborate for their own reasons. Fourteen publishers did not response. Seven of them sent us the information we requested. After we received the contact addresses from the publishers, we then wrote a letter directly to the author. A permission form in which selected publications are listed was attached in the letter. We asked them to sign a permission form and return it in the enclosed envelope. To make them feel easier to support us, we informed them that they may remove their works from the TNC anytime by writing a letter informing us to do so. We did not even ask for a copy of the book or the article. We will look for those texts and typing them in ourselves. By doing this, we did not put a burden on the copyright owners. 1n addition, we contacted the P.E.N 1nternational-Thailand Centre, which is the association of publishers, editors, and novelists in Thailand, asking for contact addresses of novelists. For academic writers, we searched for their contact addresses from university websites. Of those 780 authors we had contacted, 250 of them granted us the permission to use their texts. We suspected that the address list we received from the P.E.N 1nternational- Thailand Centre may be out-of-date because we received only 41 replies from 278 requests to novelists. For texts that are not copyrighted in Thai, e.g. news reports, documents from governments, laws and orders etc., they are collected preferably from those that are available in the internet. After texts were saved in electronic format and catalogued in the database, they were parsed by the TNC Tagger program. Texts will be word segmented and marked basic tags as described in the previous section. The process is not fully automatic. The program will ask a user to make a correction if any chunk of texts could not be parsed. This usually happened because there was a spelling error within that text chunk. After the text is parsed, contextual information of the text will be inserted by using the TNC Header program. With these two programs, texts are converted into an XML format that conforms to the TE1 P4 standard. Some problems occurred during this process will be discuss in section 4. TNC web 1t is now clear that collecting eighty million words is a long time process. At present, only fourteen million words are processed in the TNC. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to make the corpus 154 accessible to the public. So, we had been developing a web interface to search the TNC, or the TNC web is a web interface for concordance software that will show not only keyword-incontext but also collocations and distributions of the keyword. When users enter a keyword, the distribution of keyword in five major genres will be shown on the right window. Users can click on the frequency of occurrence in any genre on this window. A concordance window will then be displayed underneath. Users can filter the search by specifying a genre, a domain, published year, authors&apos; age range, and authors&apos; gender. By doing this, users can search for the occurrence of the keyword in any specific context. Figure 1 shows the screen of concordance search from TNC web. Collocation is searched by clicking on the icon &amp;quot;COLLOCATE&amp;quot;. Collocations within 1-3 words on the left and right contexts will be ranked by statistical measure. Frequency of occurrence in five major genres will also be shown. Users can click on these numbers to see the concordance context. Figures 2 and 3 shows the collocation of keyword `run&apos; using log-likelihood and mutual information. To make the processing time acceptable, the XML data was converted into MySQL database and PHP scripting language was used for web development. Co-occurrences of words are also stored as precache data. By doing this, the size of the data storage gets larger. The XML data of 14 million words, which is about 365 megabytes, is expanded to 2,064 megabytes on the server. Though at present, the TNC is not balance and does not have a proportion of texts as planned, making it searchable through the web is still a useful idea. Users can get authentic data in various genres. And it would be easier for us to explain to the public what the TNC is and how it can be used. 4 Problems The difficulties of creating the TNC are grounded on management rather than technical problems. The most difficult part is to get copyright texts. Unexpected errors during the process of creating an annotation text are also another problem causing a delay in creating the TNC. tnc2/ 4.1 Getting more texts Though the use of corpora is quite well known to academics, it is little known to the public at large. Without understanding from the people especially writers and publishers, it is not easy to get the support and collaboration from them. This is the main obstruction causing a delay in creating the TNC. 1mplementing TNC web is one method of getting TNC known to the public. Another strategy that we plan to do is to publicize the project and praise those who contributed their texts to the project. At this moment, a number of famous novelists had granted us the permission to include parts of their novels in the TNC. We could use these names to make other people feel that it is a privilege to have their texts as a part of TNC. Another strategy of promoting TNC is to show its worth. We plan to publish a series of linguistic papers that use TNC as data of analysis, and demonstrate how basic information like word frequency and collocations in different genres can be used for teaching the Thai language. 4.2 Validating data The delay in creating the TNC is also caused during the process of encoding data. As stated earlier in section 2, texts have to be parsed and encoded as XML data. During this process, different types of errors are found. These have to be handled to make the data correct and consistent. System errors (unintentional): This is an unintentional typo that produces an ill-formed string. These errors are easier to detect and most people would agree that they should be corrected. For ill-formed because a consocharacter is missing after . string cannot be parsed and read. 1t should be edited as broken, this morning&apos;. System errors (intentional): This is an intentional typo that produces an ill-formed string. Even if the string produced from this type is illformed with respect to orthography rules, they are written intentionally to intensify meaning. example, is a word in which the last consonant is repeated to intensify the degree of difficulty. Hidden errors: This is also an unintentional typo error because the actual text should be something else. But the error does not produce an ill-formed string. The string can be parsed and readable. But its meaning could be strange because the actual word is mistaken as another For example, the phrase well- 155 because it can be read as four words &amp;quot;1 `car, grandfather, middle, street&apos;. But its meaning is anomalous. Thus, it should be to `car, broken, middle, street&apos; - `the car was broken in the middle of the street. This type of error is called &amp;quot;hidden error&amp;quot; because it could not be detected by simply applying orthography rules. To correct this type of error, manual editing might be required. Variation of writing: This type is not exactly an error. 1t is a variation of written form produced by different authors. From a prescriptive view, it could be viewed as an error and should be corrected. Some variations are a result of the lack of knowledge in spelling. For example, people write the word `globalizaincorrectly as write the word that does not conform to orthographic rules, e.g. which should be written as 1t is possible that they do not know how to spell these words, which makes it an unintentional error. Preserving these errors would provide us authentic information, which will be very useful for studying spelling problems. Nevertheless, since the TNC is expected to be a reference of Thai language usages, keeping these variations could confuse users who want to know the correct or standard form of writing. Therefore, these variations should be corrected and removed from the TNC. However, these variations will be saved in an error log file for further use of spelling prob- However, we do not think that all variations of writing are errors. Variations caused by different transliteration methods should be kept as they are. When transliterating foreign words, it is likely that they are written differently despite the fact that a guideline for transliteration to Thai has been proposed by the Royal 1nstitute. For example, the word &amp;quot;internet&amp;quot; is found written as variations are not seen as errors and therefore are not modified. Segmentation errors: These are errors caused by the segmentation program. 1t is likely that the program would segment proper names incorrect- For example, the name segas &lt;w 2Thanks to Dr. Virach Sornlertlamvanich for making this suggestion. tran=&amp;quot;pra1s@@t1&amp;quot;&gt; instead of &lt;w &lt;w A Thai named entity recognition module is needed to handle this problem. But before the module is included in the TNC tagger, these errors have to be manually corrected. To correct errors caused by typos, we could compare the same text typed by two typists. But this method would double the expense of typing. Therefore, we seek to detect typos indirectly by using the TNC Tagger program. Basically, the program will segment words in the text. 1f a typo causes an ill-formed character sequence, the program will fail to segment that character sequence. Then, a pop-up screen asking for a correction of that string sequence will appear. 1f it is an unintentional system error, the correct word will be typed in. 1f it is an intentional system error, the intentionally incorrect word will be tagged manually. After the program finishes segmenting words, the program will create a list of unknown words (words that are not found in the dictionary) and words that occur only once in the file. This word list will be used by the TNC Editor program for spotting errors that are not typos. TNC Editor will be used for manually editing the document, especially the hidden, variation, and segmentation errors. 4. 3 Obtaining authorization Acquiring permission from the copyright holders is a time consuming process. We once thought of a way to use copyright text under a condition of &amp;quot;fair use&amp;quot; stated in the copyright protection act in Thailand. According to the act, any writing is automatically protected by the law throughout the life of the creator plus fifty years after the author dies. However, some works are not copyrighted, such as news reports which are facts rather than opinions; constitution and laws; rules, regulation, reports or documents issued by government organizations, etc. On section 32 of the copyright protection act, certain uses of copyright materials are not considered a violation of copyright law, such as making a copy of text for research purpose without making a profit, making a copy for private use, for criticism with an acknowledgement of the writer, for teaching or educational purpose without making a profit, etc. But all these activities must not affect the benefits that the copyright holders should have received from their works. , or All of these &apos; % , , &apos; &apos; &apos; n W&amp;quot;137 r1J r1J &amp;quot; &apos; , &amp;quot; r1J 156 1n addition, on section 33, it is stated that a reasonable and acceptable part of a copyright work can be copied or cited if the copyright owner is acknowledged. Therefore, we had consulted an eminent law firm whether our project can make use of these exceptions of the Thai copyright law. 1s it possible to argue that the texts we collected are used for educational/research purpose and no profit is generated from the TNC? 1n addition, users can see the bibliographic reference of each concordance line. Thus, is it possible to conclude that our uses of copyright texts are under the condition of &amp;quot;fair use&amp;quot;? However, the lawyers thought that we cannot use those argumentations since the text size we collected could be up to 40,000 words. Although the reference to the source text is shown to the users, the text length is greater than acceptable level. The TNC project is the project for creating a new database. Texts collected in this project are not used for criticism or for the study of those texts per se. Our activity in collecting copyright texts could affect the benefits the copyright holder should have. Thus, the creation of a corpus is not under the conditions of sections 32 and 33. At the end, the law firm advised us to continue asking for authorization from the copyright holder as we have been doing. 5 Future plan We plan to run three tasks concurrently: cleaning up data, expanding data, and utilizing the corpus. For cleaning up data, Thai named entity recognition module will be implemented to reduce errors of word segmentation. But at the end, TNC Editor is needed to clean up segmented data manually. The program is now under development by 1BM Thailand Co.,Ltd. For expanding data, more publishers and writers are being contacted. Copyright texts are now constantly being added into the corpus. But to increase the growth rate of the corpus size, we would prefer to have people submitting their works themselves. We hope that by making the corpus searchable online and revealing famous writers who had contributed their works will make people feel that it is the prestige to have their works included in the corpus. 1t remains to be seen whether our plan to publicize the TNC project will be successful. And finally, to increase the worth of TNC, we will encourage linguists to use TNC as the basis of Thai language studies. Basic facts like word lists in different genres will be released. We also hope that new Thai language resources like dictionaries and grammar books could be produced based on the actual usages found in the TNC. 6 Conclusion 1n this paper we described the current status of the TNC project and the problems causing the delay of collecting data. The future work will still be focused on collecting more texts, both copyright and non-copyright material. We hope to fill the TNC with texts according to the designed proportion in the dimensions of domain, medium, and genres. We hope that our publicizing plan, making the TNC known to the public and praising those who contributed their texts, would easy the process of text collection. Given that there are a huge number of texts available on the internet, it would be easier to collect texts from the internet without going through the process of obtaining authorization from the copyright holders. 1n fact, many corpora have been collected directly from the web (Baroni and Ueyama, 2006; Fletcher, 2007 ), or the web itself has been used as a corpus (Killgarriff and Grefenstettey, 2003 ). 1t might be true that natural language processing research can use web as data source for their works effectively. Nevertheless, we think that by getting authorization from text owners, we could fully distribute the source data. And this is necessary for linguistic analysis. 1n addition, by manually selecting and categorizing data to be included in the corpus, users can look for similarity and difference between different text settings. Therefore, we believe that the creation of TNC will still be fruitful for research especially on Thai linguistic analysis.

However, only written texts are collected in the TNC, and the corpus size is targeted at eighty million words. 1n addition to domain and medium criteria, texts are also selected and categorized on the basis of their genres. We adopted Lee&apos;s idea of categorizing texts into different genres based on external factors like the purpose of communication, participants, and the settings of communication (Lee 2001 ). Texts in the same genre share the same characteristics of language usages, e.g. discourse structure, sentence patterns, etc. Moreover, since TNC is a representative of the standard Thai language at present, 90% of the texts will be texts produced before 1998. The rest 10% can be texts produced before 1998 if they are published recently. Therefore, the structure of TNC is shaped on the dimensions of domain, medium, genres and time (see Table 1 ). Texts that fit into the designed portion of these criteria will be selected. After that, copyright holders of each text will be contacted and aske</context>
