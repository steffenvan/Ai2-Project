We are pleased to present the proceedings of the Workshop on Integer Linear Programming for Natural
Language Processing, held at NAACL HLT 2009 in Boulder, Colorado.
Integer Linear Programming (ILP) has recently attracted much attention within the NLP community.
Formulating problems using ILP has several advantages. It allows us to focus on the modelling of
problems, rather than engineering new search algorithms; provides the opportunity to incorporate
generic global constraints; and guarantees exact inference. This and the availability of off-the-shelf
solvers has led to a large variety of natural language processing tasks being formulated in the ILP
framework, including semantic role labelling, syntactic parsing, summarisation and joint information
extraction.
The use of ILP brings many benefits and opportunities but there are still challenges for the community;
these include: formulations of new applications, dealing with large-scale problems and understanding
the interaction between learning and inference at training and decision time. The purpose of this
workshop was to bring together researchers interested in exploiting ILP for NLP applications and
tackling the issues involved. We solicited full length papers, short papers and two-page abstracts with
the purpose of providing a discussion on many topics.
We are grateful to the program committee for providing thoughtful and helpful reviews of the submitted
papers. We also thank our invited speakers, Dan Roth, Andre Martins and Noah Smith for presenting
their noteworthy work to the community.
We hope that you enjoy the workshop and these proceedings.
