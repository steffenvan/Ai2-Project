This paper describes the application of an
ensemble of indexing and classification
systems, which have been shown to be suc-
cessful in information retrieval and classi-
fication of medical literature, to a new task
of assigning ICD-9-CM codes to the clini-
cal history and impression sections of radi-
ology reports. The basic methods used are:
a modification of the NLM Medical Text
Indexer system, SVM, k-NN and a simple
pattern-matching method. The basic meth-
ods are combined using a variant of stack-
ing. Evaluated in the context of a Medical
NLP Challenge, fusion produced an F-
score of 0.85 on the Challenge test set,
which is considerably above the mean
Challenge F-score of 0.77 for 44 participat-
ing groups.

Researchers at the National Library of Medicine
(NLM) have developed the Medical Text Indexer
(MTI) for the automatic indexing of the biomedical
literature (Aronson et al., 2004). The unsupervised
methods within MTI were later successfully com-
bined with machine learning techniques and ap-
plied to the classification tasks in the Genomics
Track evaluations at the Text Retrieval Conference
(TREC) (Aronson et al., 2005 and Demner-
Fushman et al., 2006). This fusion approach con-

sists of using several basic classification methods
with complementary strengths, combining the re-
sults using a modified ensemble method based on
stacking (Ting and Witten, 1997).
While these methods have shown reasonable
performance on indexing and retrieval tasks of
biomedical articles, it remains to be determined
how they would perform on a different biomedical
corpus (e.g., clinical text) and on a different task
(e.g., coding to a different controlled vocabulary).
However, except for competitive evaluations such
as TREC or BioCreAtIvE, corpora and gold stan-
dards for such tasks are generally not available,
which is a limiting factor for such studies. For a
survey of currently available corpora and devel-
opments in biomedical language processing, see
Hunter and Cohen, 2006.
The Medical NLP Challenge1 sponsored by a
number of groups including the Computational
Medicine Center (CMC) at the Cincinnati Chil-
dren’s Hospital Medical Center gave us the oppor-
tunity to apply our fusion approach to a clinical
corpus. The Challenge was to assign ICD-9-CM
codes (International Classification of Diseases, 9th
Revision, Clinical Modification)2 to clinical text
consisting of anonymized clinical history and im-
pression sections of radiology reports.
The Medical NLP Challenge organizers distrib-
uted a training corpus of almost 1,000 of the ano-
nymized, abbreviated radiology reports along with

gold standard ICD-9-CM assignments for each
report obtained via a consensus of three independ-
ent sets of assignments. The primary measure for
the Challenge was defined as the balanced F-score,
with a secondary measure being cost-sensitive ac-
curacy. These measures were computed for sub-
missions to the Challenge based on a test corpus
similar in size to the training corpus but distributed
without gold standard code assignments.
The main objective of this study is to determine
what adaptation of the original methods is required
to code clinical text with ICD-9-CM, in contrast to
indexing and retrieving MEDLINE®. Note that an
earlier study (Gay et al., 2005) showed that only
minor adaptations were required in extending the
original model to full-text biomedical articles. A
secondary objective is to evaluate the performance
of our methods in this new setting.

In early experimentation with the training corpus
provided by the Challenge organizers, we discov-
ered that several of the training cases involved ne-
gated assertions in the text and that deleting these
improved the performance of all basic methods
being tested. For example, “no pneumonia” occurs
many times in the impression section of a report,
sometimes with additional context. Section 2.1
describes the process we used to remove these ne-
gated expressions; section 2.2 consists of descrip-
tions of the four basic methods used in this study;
and section 2.3 defines the fusion of the basic
methods to form a final result.

The NegEx program (Chapman et al., 2001a and
2001b, and Goldin and Chapman, 2003), which
discovers negated expressions in text, was used to
find negated expressions in the training and test
corpora using a dictionary generated from concepts
from the 2006AD version of the UMLS® Metathe-
saurus® (excluding the AMA vocabularies). A ta-
ble containing the concept unique identifier (CUI)
and English string (STR with LAT=‘ENG’) was
extracted from the main concept table, MRCON,
and was used as input to NegEx to generate a dic-
tionary that was later used as the universe of ex-
pressions which NegEx could find to be negated in
the target corpora. (See the Appendix for examples
of the input and output to this process.)
The XML text of the training and test corpora
was converted to a tree representation and then
traversed, operating on one radiology report at a
time. The clinical history and impression sections
of each report were tokenized to allow whitespace
to be separated from the punctuation, numbers and
alphabetic text. The concepts from the UMLS were
tokenized in the same way, to allow the concepts
found by NegEx to be aligned with the text. The
negation phrases discovered by NegEx were also
tokenized to find the appropriate negation phrase
preceding or trailing the target concept. Using the
location information obtained by matching the set
of one or more target concepts and the associated
negation phrase, the overlapping concept spans
were merged and the span for the negation phrase
and the outermost negated concept was removed.
Any intervening concepts associated with the same
negation phrase were removed, too. The abbrevi-
ated tree representation was then re-serialized back
into XML.
As an example of our use of NegEx, consider
the report with clinical history “13-year 2-month -
old female evaluate for cough.” and impression
“No focal pneumonia.” After removal of negated
text, the clinical history becomes “13-year 2-month
- old female”, and the discussion is empty.

2.2 Basic Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999307736842105">
The four basic methods used for the Medical NLP
Challenge are MTI (a modification of NLM’s
Medical Text Indexer system), SVM (Support
Vector Machines), k-NN (k Nearest Neighbors)
and Pattern Matching (a simple, pattern-based clas-
sifier). Each of these methods is described here.
Note that the MTI method uses a “Restrict to ICD-
9-CM” algorithm that is described in the next sec-
tion.
MTI. The original Medical Text Indexer (MTI)
system, shown in Figure 1, consists of an infra-
structure for applying alternative methods of dis-
covering MeSH® headings for citation titles and
abstracts and then combining them into an ordered
list of recommended indexing terms. The top por-
tion of the diagram consists of two paths, or meth-
ods, for creating a list of recommended indexing
terms: MetaMap Indexing and PubMed® Related
Citations. The MetaMap Indexing path actually

computes UMLS Metathesaurus concepts, which
are passed to the Restrict to MeSH process
(Bodenreider et al., 1998). The results from each
path are weighted and combined using Post-
Processing, which also refines the results to con-
form to NLM indexing policy. The system is
highly parameterized not only by path weights but
also by several parameters specific to the Restrict
to MeSH and Post-Processing processes.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998352">
For use in the Challenge, the Medical Text In-
dexer (MTI) program itself required few adapta-
tions. Most of the changes involved the environ-
ment from which MTI obtains the data it uses
without changing the normal parameter settings.
We also added a further post-processing compo-
nent to filter our results.
For the environment, we replaced MTI’s normal
“Restrict to MeSH” algorithm with a “Restrict to
ICD-9-CM” algorithm, described below, in order
to map UMLS concepts to ICD-9-CM codes in-
stead of MeSH headings. We also trained the Pub-
Med Related Citations component, TexTool (Ta-
nabe and Wilbur, 2002), on the Medical NLP Chal-
lenge training data instead of the entire MED-
LINE/PubMed database as is the case for normal
MTI use at NLM. For both of these methods, we
used the actual ICD-9-CM codes to mimic UMLS
CUIs used internally by MTI.
To create the new training data for the TexTool
(Related Citations), we reformatted the Medical
NLP Challenge training data into a pseudo-
MEDLINE format using the “doc id” component
as the PMID, the “CLINICAL_HISTORY” text
component for the Title, the “IMPRESSION” text
component for the Abstract, and all of the
“CMC_MAJORITY” codes as MeSH Headings
(see Figure 2). This provided us with direct ICD-
9-CM codes to work with instead of MeSH Head-
ings.

Within MTI we also utilized an experimental
option for MetaMap (Composite Phrases), which
provides a longer UMLS concept match than usual.
We did not use the following: (1) UMLS concept-

the MeSH Subheading generation, checking, and

Restrict to ICD-9-CM. The mapping of every
UMLS concept to ICD-9-CM developed for the
Medical NLP Challenge is an adaptation of the
original mapping to MeSH, later generalized to any
target vocabulary (Fung and Bodenreider, 2005).
Based on the UMLS Metathesaurus, the mapping
utilizes four increasingly aggressive techniques:
synonymy, built-in mappings, hierarchical map-
pings and associative mappings. In order to comply
with coding rules in ICD-9-CM, mappings to non-
leaf codes are later resolved into leaf codes.
Mappings to ICD-9-CM are identified through
synonymy when names from ICD-9-CM are in-
cluded in the UMLS concept identified by
MetaMap. For example, the ICD-9-CM code 592.0
Calculus of kidney is associated with the UMLS
concept C0392525 Nephrolithiasis through synon-
ymy.
Built-in mappings are mapping relations be-
tween UMLS concepts implied from mappings
provided by source vocabularies in the UMLS. For
example, the UMLS concept C0239937 Micro-
scopic hematuria is mapped to the concept
C0018965 (which contains the ICD-9-CM code
599.7 Hematuria) through a mapping provided by
SNOMED CT.
In the absence of a mapping through synonymy
or built-in mapping, a hierarchical mapping is
attempted. Starting from the concept identified by
MetaMap, a graph of ancestors is built by first us-
ing its parent concepts and broader concepts, then
adding the parent concepts and broader concepts of
each concept, recursively. Semantic constraints
(based on semantic types) are applied in order to
prevent semantic drift. Ancestor concepts closest
to the MetaMap source concept are selected from
the graph. Only concepts that can be resolved into
ICD-9-CM codes (through synonymy or built-in
mapping) are selected. For example, starting from
C0239574 Low grade pyrexia, a mapping is found
to ICD-9-CM code 780.6 Fever, which is con-
tained in the concept C0015967, one of the ances-
tors of C0239574.
The last attempt to find a mapping involves not
only hierarchical, but also associative relations.
Instead of starting from the concept identified by
MetaMap, associative mappings explore the con-
cepts in associative relation to this concept. For
example, the concept C1458136 Renal stone sub-
stance is mapped to ICD-9-CM code 592.0 Calcu-
lus of kidney.
Finally, when the identified ICD-9-CM code
was not a leaf code (e.g., 786.5 Chest pain), we
remapped it to one of the corresponding leaf codes
in the training set where possible (e.g., 786.50 Un-
specified chest pain).
Of the 2,331 UMLS concepts identified by
MetaMap in the test set after freezing the method,
620 (27%) were mapped to ICD-9-CM. More spe-
cifically, 101 concepts were mapped to one of the
45 target ICD-9-CM codes present in the training
set. Of the 101 concepts, 40 were mapped through
synonymy, 11 through built-in mappings, 40
through hierarchical mapping and 10 through asso-
ciative mapping.
After the main MTI processing was completed,
we applied a post-processing filter, restricting our
results to the list of 94 valid combinations of ICD-
9-CM codes provided in the training set (hence-
forth referred to as allowed combinations) and
slightly emphasizing MetaMap results. Examples
of the post-processing rules are:

training data. To prepare the Challenge data for
analysis, we removed all stop words and created
feature vectors for the free text extracted from the
“CLINICAL_HISTORY” and “IMPRESSION”
fields of the records. Since both the training and
test Challenge data had a known finite number of
individual ICD-9-CM labels (45) and distinct com-
binations of ICD-9-CM labels (94), the data was
prepared both as feature vectors for 45 individual
labels as well as a model with 94 combination la-
bels. In addition, the feature vectors were created
using both simple term frequency as well as in-
verse document frequency (IDF) weighting, where
the weight is (1+log(term frequency))*(total
documents/document frequency). There were thus
a total of four feature vector datasets: 1) 45 indi-
vidual ICD-9-CM labels and simple term fre-
quency, 2) 45 ICD-9-CM labels and IDF weight-
ing, 3) 94 ICD-9-CM combinations and simple
term frequency, and 4) 94 ICD-9-CM combina-
tions and IDF weighting.
The YALE tool encompasses a number of SVM
learners and kernel types. For the classification
problem at hand, we chose the C-SVM learner and
the radial basis function (rbf) kernel. The C-SVM
learner attempts to minimize the error function
γi (wTϕ(xi)+b)≥1−ξi and ξi ≥ 0, i = 1,...,N
where w is the vector of coefficients, b is a con-
stant, ϕ is the kernel function, x are the independ-
ent variables, and 4i are parameters for handling
the inputs. C &gt; 0 is the penalty parameter of the
error function. The rbf kernel is defined as K(x,
x’) = exp(−y |x − x’|2), y &gt; 0 where y is a kernel
parameter that determines the rbf width. We ran
cross-validation experiments using YALE on all
training datasets and varying C (10, 100, 1000,
10000) and y (0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001) to de-
termine the optimal C and y combination. The
cross-validation experiments generated classifica-
tion models that were then applied to the complete
training datasets to analyze the performance of the
learner. The 94 ICD-9-CM combination and sim-
ple term frequency dataset with C = 10000 and y =
0.01 had the best F-score at 0.86. The best F-score
for the 94 ICD-9-CM combination and IDF weight
dataset was 0.79, where C = 0.001 and y = 10000.
Further preprocessing the training dataset by
removing negated expressions was found to im-
prove the best F-score from 0.86 to 0.87. The C =
10000 and y = 0.01 combination was then applied
to the test dataset, which was preprocessed to re-
move negation and stop words and transformed to
a feature vector using 94 ICD-9-CM combinations
and simple term weighting. The predicted ICD-9-
CM classifications and confidence of the predic-
tions for each clinical free text report were output
and later combined with other methods to optimize
the accuracy and precision of our ICD-9-CM clas-
sifications.
k-NN. The Challenge training set was used to
build a k-NN classifier. The k-NN classification
method works by identifying, within a labelled set,
documents similar to the document being classi-
fied, and inferring a classification for it from the
labels of the retrieved neighbors.
The free text in the training data set was proc-
essed to obtain a vector-space representation of the
patient reports.
Several methods of obtaining this representation
were tested: after stop words were removed, simple
term frequency and inverse document frequency
(IDF) weighting were applied alternatively. A
higher weight was also given to words appearing in
the history portion of the text (vs. impression).
Eventually, the most efficient representation was
obtained by using controlled vocabulary terms ex-
tracted from the free text with MetaMap.4 Further
processing on this representation of the training
data showed that removing negated portions of the
free text improved the results, raising the F-score
from 0.76 to 0.79.
Other parameters were also assessed on the
training data, such as the number of neighbors to
use (2 was found to be the best vs. 5, 10 or 15) and
the restriction of the ICD-9-CM predictions to the
set of 94 allowed combinations. When the predic-
tion for a given document was not within the set of
allowed 94 combinations, an allowed subset of the
ICD-9-CM codes predicted was selected based on
the individual scores obtained for each ICD-9-CM
code.
The best F-score (F = 0.79) obtained on the
training set used the MetaMap-based representa-

tion with simple frequency counts on the text with
negated expressions removed. ICD-9-CM predic-
tions were obtained from the nearest neighbors and
restricted to one of the 94 allowed combinations.
Pattern Matching. We developed a pattern-
matching classifier as a baseline for our more so-
phisticated classification methods. A list of all
UMLS string representations for each of 45 codes
(including synonyms from source vocabularies
other than ICD-9-CM) was created as described in
the MTI section above. The strings were then con-
verted to lower case, punctuation was removed,
and strings containing terms unlikely to be found
in a clinical report were pruned. For example, Ab-
domen NOS pain and Abdominal pain (finding)
were reduced to abdominal pain. For the same rea-
sons, some of the strings were relaxed into pat-
terns. For example, it is unlikely to see PAIN
CHEST in a chart, but very likely to find pain in
chest. The string, therefore, was relaxed to the fol-
lowing pattern: pain.*chest. The text of the clinical
history and the impression fields of the radiology
reports with negated expressions removed (see
Section 2.2) was broken up into sentences. Each
sentence was then searched for all available pat-
terns. A corresponding code was assigned to the
document for each matched pattern. This pattern
matching achieved F-score = 0.79 on the training
set. To reduce the number of codes assigned to a
document, a check for allowed combinations was
added as a post-processing step. The combination
of assigned codes was looked up in the table of
allowed codes. If not present, the codes were re-
duced to the combination of assigned codes most
frequently occurring in the training set. This
brought the F-score up to 0.84 on the training data.
As the performance of this classifier was compara-
ble to other methods, we decided to include these
results when combining the predictions of the other
classifiers.

Genomics Track has shown that combining predic-

proves classification results, or at least provides
more consistent and stable results when the train-
ing data set is small (Aronson et al., 2005). We
therefore experimented with stacking (Ting and

It is significant that it was fairly straightforward to
port various methods developed for ad hoc MED-
LINE citation retrieval, indexing and classification
to the assignment of codes to clinical text. The
modifications to MTI consisted of replacing Re-
strict to MeSH with Restrict to ICD-9-CM, training
the Related Citations method on clinical text and
replacing MTI’s normal post-processing with a
much simpler version. Preprocessing the text using

NegEx to remove negated expressions was a fur-
ther modification of the overall approach.
It is noteworthy that a simple pattern-matching
method performed as well as much more sophisti-
cated methods in the effort to fuse results from
several methods into a final outcome. This unex-
pected success might be explained by the follow-
ing limitations of the Challenge.
Possible limitations on the extensibility of the
current research arise from two observations: (1)
the Challenge cases were limited to two relatively
narrow topics, cough/fever/pneumonia and uri-
nary/kidney problems; and (2) the clinical text was
almost error-free, a situation that would not be ex-
pected in the majority of clinical text. It is possible
that these conditions contributed to the success of
the pattern-matching method but also caused
anomalous behavior, such as the fact that simple
frequency counts provided a better representation
than IDF for the SVM and k-NN methods.
Finally, as a result of low confidence in the
ICD-9-CM code assignment, no codes were as-
signed to 29 records in the test set. It is worthwhile
to explore the causes for such null assignments.
One of the reasons for low confidence could be the
aggressive pruning of the text by the negation algo-
rithm. For example, after removal of negated text
in the sample report given in section 2.1, the only
remaining text is “13-year 2-month - old female”
from the clinical history field; this provided no
evidence for code assignment. Secondly, in some
cases the original text was not sufficient for confi-
dent code assignment. For example, for the docu-
ment with clinical history “Bilateral grade 3.” and
impression “Interval growth of normal appearing
Kidneys”, no code was assigned by the SVM, k-
NN, or pattern-matching classifiers. Code 593.70
corresponding to the UMLS concept Vesicouret-
eral reflux with reflux nephropathy, unspecified or
without reflux nephropathy was assigned by MTI
with a very low confidence, which was not suffi-
cient for the final assignment of the code. The third
reason for assigning no code to a document was
the wide range of assignments provided by the
base classifiers. For example, for the following
document: “CLINICAL_HISTORY: 3-year - old
male with history of left ureteropelvic and uret-
erovesical obstruction. Status post left pyeloplasty
and left ureteral reimplantation. IMPRESSION: 1.
Stable appearance and degree of hydronephrosis
involving the left kidney. Stable urothelial thicken-
ing. 2. Interval growth of kidneys, left greater than
right. 3. Normal appearance of the right kidney
with interval resolution of right urothelial thicken-
ing.” MTI assigned codes 593.89 Other specified
disorders of kidney and ureter and 591 Hy-
dronephrosis. Codes 593.70 Vesicoureteral reflux
with reflux nephropathy, unspecified or without
reflux nephropathy and 753.3 Double kidney with
double pelvis were assigned by the k-NN classifier.
Pattern matching resulted in assignment of code
591 with fairly low confidence. No code was as-
signed to this document by the SVM classifier.
Despite failing to assign codes to these 29 records,
the conservative approach (using threshold) re-
sulted in better performance, achieving F-score
0.85 compared to F-score 0.80 when all 1,634
codes assigned by the base classifiers were used.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999275">
We are left with two conclusions. First, this re-
search confirms that combining several comple-
mentary methods for accomplishing tasks, ranging
from ad hoc retrieval to categorization, produces
results that are better and more stable than the re-
sults for the contributing methods. Furthermore,
we have shown that the basic methods employing
domain knowledge and advanced statistical algo-
rithms are applicable to clinical text without sig-
nificant modification. Second, although there are
some limitations of the current Challenge test col-
lection of clinical text, we appreciate the efforts of
the Challenge organizers in the creation of a test
collection of clinical text. This collection provides
a unique opportunity to apply existing methods to a
new and important domain.

The basic methods used are: a modification of the NLM Medical Text Indexer system, SVM, k-NN and a simple pattern-matching method. The basic methods are combined using a variant of stacking. Evaluated in the context of a Medical NLP Challenge, fusion produced an Fscore of 0.85 on the Challenge test set, which is considerably above the mean Challenge F-score of 0.77 for 44 participating groups.</abstract>

The original Medical Text Indexer (MTI) system, shown in Figure 1, consists of an infrastructure for applying alternative methods of discovering MeSH® headings for citation titles and abstracts and then combining them into an ordered list of recommended indexing terms. The top portion of the diagram consists of two paths, or methods, for creating a list of recommended indexing terms: MetaMap Indexing and PubMed® Related Citations. The MetaMap Indexing path actually 106 computes UMLS Metathesaurus concepts, which are passed to the Restrict to MeSH process (Bodenreider et al., 1998). The results from each path are weighted and combined using PostProcessing, which also refines the results to conform to NLM indexing policy. The system is highly parameterized not only by path weights but also by several parameters specific to the Restrict to MeSH and Post-Processing processes. Figure 1: Medical Text Indexer (MTI) System For use in the Challenge, the Medical Text Indexer (MTI) program itself required few adaptations. Most of the changes involved the environment from which MTI obtains the data it uses without changing the normal parameter settings. We also added a further pos</context>
