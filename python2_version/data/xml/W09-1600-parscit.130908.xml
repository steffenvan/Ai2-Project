The development of digital and online information repositories is creating many opportunities and
also new challenges in information retrieval. The availability of online documents in many different
languages makes it possible for users around the world to directly access previously unimagined sources
of information. However in conventional information retrieval systems the user must enter a search
query in the language of the documents in order to retrieve it. This requires that users can express their
queries in those languages in which the information is available and can understand the documents
returned by the retrieval process. This restriction clearly limits the amount and type of information that
an individual user really has access to.
Cross Lingual Information Access is concerned with technologies that let users express their query
intheir native language, and irrespective of the language in which the information is available, present
theinformation in the user-preferred language or set of languages, in a manner that satisfies the user’s
informationneeds. The additional processing may take the form of machine translation of snippets,
summarization and subsequent translation of summaries and/or information extraction.
In recent times, research in Cross Lingual Information Access has been vigorously pursued through
several international fora, such as, the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF), NTCIR Asian
Language Retrieval, Question-answering Workshop and such other fora. A workshop geared towards
cross language information retrieval in Indian languages (FIRE) was organized in December 2008.
In addition to CLIR, significant results have been obtained in multilingual summarization workshops
and cross-language named entity extraction challenges by the ACL (Association for Computational
Linguistics) and the Geographic Information retrieval (GeoCLEF) track of CLEF.
The previous two issues of this workshop were held in January 2007, during IJCAI 2007 in Hyderabad,
India (http://search.iiit.ac.in/CLIA2007/) and subsequently during IJCNLP 2008 in Hyderabad, India
(http://search.iiit.ac.in/CLIA2008/). Both the previous workshops attracted an encouraging number of
submissions, and a large number of registered participants.
This third international workshop on Cross Lingual Information Access aims to bring together various
trends in multi-source, cross and multilingual information retrievaland access, and provide a venue for
researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to interact and share a broad
spectrum of ideas, views and applications. The present workshop includes an invited keynote talk,
presentations of technical papers selected after peer review followed by a panel discussion.
The workshop starts with an invited keynote talk titled Cross-Language Information Access: Looking
Backward, Looking Forward by Douglas W. Oard. The talk starts with a brief recapitulation of two
earlier generations of automated support for cross-language information access, the first from roughly
1964 to 1985, and the second from roughly 1989 to the present. With that as background, the talk
takes stock of where we are, and where we see unmet needs that call for capabilities beyond what can
currently be accomplished. It will be concluded with a few observations about how we might expect
the role of the research community to evolve as progressively more capable cross-language information
access technologies become commercially viable. In the other paper in the first session, Zhuang et al.
report a quasi-language-independent subword recognizer trained on multiple languages, to obtain an
abstracted representation of speech data in an unknown language. A retrieval model based on finite
state machines for fuzzy matching of speech sound patterns, and further for speech retrieval has been
proposed. A pilot study of speech retrieval in unknown languages is presented using English, Spanish
and Russian as training languages, and Croatian as the unknown target language.
In the second session, Raj and Maganti present a transliteration based search engine capable of
searching 10 multi-script and multi-encoded Indian languages content on the web. Bouma et al. present
a method for cross-lingual alignment of template and infobox attributes in Wikipedia. Elena Filatova
presents preliminary results on quantifying Wikipedia multilinguality which show that asymmetries in
multilingual Wikipedia do not make it an undesirable corpus for NLP applications training.
In the third session, Zubaryeva and Savoy present a new statistical approach to opinion detection and its
evaluation on the English, Chinese and Japanese corpora. Katragadda et al. describe a sentence position
based summarizer based on a sentence position policy, created from the evaluation test bed of recent
summarization tasks at Document Understanding Conferences (DUC). Sankar and Sobha propose an
efficient text summarization technique that involves two basic operations, finding coherent chunks in
the document and ranking the text in the individual coherent chunks and picking the sentences that rank
above a given threshold.
In the fourth and final session of the workshop, Mukund and Srihari propose a bootstrapped model
that involves four levels of text processing for Urdu and show that increasing the training data for POS
learning by applying bootstrapping techniques improves NE tagging results. The workshop concludes
with a panel discussion.
We thank Douglas W. Oard for the invited keynote talk, all the members of the Program Committee for
their excellent and insightful reviews, the authors who submitted contributions for the workshop and
the participants for making the workshop a success. We also express our thanks to Asif, Partha and
Babji who helped us in organizing and preparing the proceedings as well as maintaining the workshop
webpage.
