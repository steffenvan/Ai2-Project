<bodyText confidence="0.999376666666667">
Since early 1990s, with the advancement of machine learning methods and the availability of
data resources such as treebanks and parallel corpora, data-driven approaches to NLP have made
significant progress. The success of such data-driven approaches has cast doubt on the relevance
of linguistics to NLP. Conversely, NLP techniques are rarely used to help linguistics studies.
We believe that there is room to expand the involvement of linguistics in NLP, and likewise,
NLP in linguistics, and that the cross-pollination of ideas between the disciplines can greatly
benefit both fields. We are pleased to present the workshop on NLP and Linguistics: Finding
the Common Ground in order to focus on some of the work that uses NLP and linguistics for
mutual benefit, and discuss future plans for continuing collaborations.
The workshop is intended to spur discussion on how NLP and linguistics can help each other,
including new methods in incorporating linguistic knowledge into statistical systems to advance
the state of the art of NLP, and the feasibility of using NLP techniques to acquire linguistic
knowledge for a large number of languages and to assist linguistic studies. Fifteen papers were
submitted and nine were accepted (one later withdrew), and the accepted papers are oriented
around the following themes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99432062962963">
• Research that shows awareness of a particular linguistic phenomenon and
its effects on statistical systems: Caines and Buttery discuss the zero auxiliary
construction (You talking to me?), awareness of which can improve performance of NLP
on spoken English. Samaradzic and Merlo suggest that awareness of different types of
light verb constructions could affect word alignment. Su, Huang, and Chen show that the
linguistic notion of evidentiality can be used for automatic detection of trustworthiness.
• New methods in incorporating linguistic knowledge into statistical systems to
improve the start of the art: The papers by Caines and Buttery, Cook and Stevenson,
Samaradzic and Merlo, and Su, Huang, and Chen all present a number of linguistic features
that can be used for modeling or other corpus-based tasks.
• Research that demonstrates the feasibility of creating NLP systems to
automatically acquire linguistic knowledge for a large number of languages:
Mayer, Rohrdantz, Plank, Bak, Butt, and Keim examine a phonotactic constraint in 3,200
languages. Poornima and Good propose the repurposing of traditional word lists from
historical and comparative linguistics to NLP applications.
• Research that demonstrates the benefits of using NLP techniques to help
particular linguistic studies: This volume is rich with examples of corpus-based
techniques shedding light on linguistic phenomena, including the ambiguity of German
past participles (ZarrieB, Cahill, Kuhn, and Rohrer), zero auxiliary constructions (Caines
and Buttery), light verbs (Samaradzic and Merlo), a paradoxical reading of “no X is too
Y to Z&amp;quot; (Cook and Stevenson), the phonotactic constraint of Similar Place Avoidance
(Mayer, Rohrdantz, Plank, Bak, Butt, and Keim), and evidentiality (Su, Huang, and
Chen).
• The realtive strengths and weaknesses of corpus-based and rule-based
resources: Plank and van Noord examine the domain portability of rule-based and corpus-
trained parsers. ZarrieB, Cahill, Kunh, and Rohrer show that a corpus-based analysis can
help reduce ambiguity of German past participles in a rule-based parser.

In addition to the presenters of papers, the workshop includes two panels to discuss the potential
contributions of NLP to linguistics and linguistics to NLP. The panelists in the Linguistics-helps-
NLP panel have been asked to address the following questions, and the questions for the NLP-
helps-Linguistics panel are similar. Three panelists have written a short paper to summarize
their positions, and these papers have been included in the proceedings.

<listItem confidence="0.996182928571429">
1. What kinds of NLP applications could benefit from linguistics? For a particular NLP
application, what is the best way of incorporating linguistic knowledge into NLP systems
to improve the start of the art. (e.g., as rules in a preprocessing step, as linguistic features
in a statistical system, as filters for pruning a search space, as priors in an objective
function)?
2. What is the right role for a linguist in developing NLP resources (e.g., recommending
features, writing rules, or building resources such as treebanks)?
3. What are the obstacles to using linguistics in NLP and how can they be removed? What
do you wish you had available to you but don’t?
4. How can we, as a field, encourage more collaborations between NLP researchers and
linguists? Are there examples of successful collaborations, and if so, how were these
facilitated?
5. What do NLP and linguistic students need to know to engage in these collaborations?
How can we get students involved in collaborative research between the two disciplines?
