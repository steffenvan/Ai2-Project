Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9996965">
This paper focuses on how language
resources (LR) for translation (hence
LR4Trans) feature, and should ideally
feature, within a corporate workflow of
multilingual content development. The
envisaged scenario will be that of a content
management system that acknowledges the
value of LR4Trans in the organisation as a
key component and corporate knowledge
resource.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999653">
Corporations willing to go multilingual face
two main difficulties, especially at the beginning.
The first one is that many organisations are not
acquainted with the processes behind
internationalising their many products,
documents, web pages and database interfaces
effectively, so they opt to reduce the costs of
localisation (and some even do not dare to step in
and consequently remain monolingual). The
second problem, which may derive from problem
number one, relates to the fact that the corporation
is then likely to end up hiring the wrong
translation team or language service vendor after
promising a top quality product1 quickly and
inexpensively.
Unfortunately, qualified and truly skilled
candidates for posts in translation, localisation,
internationalisation, and language-related project
management are very difficult to find. Despite the
growing competition among language service

technical, scientific, commercial, written, oral, etc.)
involves both process and product. One should not put
under scrutiny just the latter and ignore the former.

<bodyText confidence="0.963388972222222">
vendors and providers, the language industry is
relatively immature. It is composed of young
language service companies that are highly
project-driven. The lessons learned in one project
may be left behind and are often not assembled in
a baseline knowledge solution to be retrieved and
leveraged later.
The fact that most companies, regardless of
whether they outsource2 their translation jobs or
have their own inhouse language service
department, pay little attention to the integration,
reusability of and interaction with language
resources for translation (LR4Trans) within a
project, let alone from project to project,
constitutes a less than desirable panorama for the
creation of corporate multilingual content.
So far, the leverage of LR4Trans has been
limited to translation memory systems, where
previously translated content is available to the
translator through a software tool. This
technology is not by any means new or highly
sophisticated. While insufficient attention has
been given to the integration of translation
memories with other language resources and
technologies3 in the workflow, modes of
accessing translation memory databases have
evolved from purely standalone to distributed
data, either synchronised with a central database
or as a remotely4 accessed central database.
2 Since the 1980s and 1990s, outsourcing of
translation, as of many highly specialised business
processes, has become prevalent. In an attempt to
lower translation-mediated communication costs, most
activities, even the application of translation memory
tools, are managed outside the boundaries of the
corporate firewall.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.976279">
3 A good start for this, though, are Bruckner &amp; Plitt
2001 and Mügge 2001.
4 This is the typical situation when outsourcing,
whereby the content moves out of the source language
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943733333333">
As a result, translation memories have gradually
become widely adopted and almost the
indispensable tool of the trade. Commercial
producers of translation memory packages claim
that, if properly used and maintained, they are
valuable corporate knowledge resources.
The question is whether translation memories
constitute the only possible corporate language
resource containing corporate knowledge, or
whether there can be other components, agents
and processes that play an important role in
multilingual content as well.
In the next section we would like to carefully
examine the notion of knowledge in connection
with those of LR4Trans and multilingual content.

2.1 Language resources and Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.953014739130435">
The breadth and depth of knowledge required
today in order to perform a good quality technical
or specialised corporate translation relies upon a
panoply of language resources (LR) in machine-
readable form, which are self-created in the
corporation or purchased from external parties
(sister organisations, domain-specific specialist
groups and societies, applied software and
solution companies, etc.). In this panoply of
corporate LR4Trans, one may find domain
specific terminology, source and target language
dictionaries of corporation-dependant word
meanings, source and target language structures
and rules, a corporate language stylesheet,
appendix of phrases and expressions denoting
cultural differences within a (multinational)
corporation or when attempting global expansion,
prescriptive and descriptive notes about the
corporation “culture”, among others.
All these resources contain precious corporate
knowledge that should be taken into consideration
and be made accessible to all corporate members
and partners accordingly. Tagging or flagging the
knowledge in those language resources will be
extremely useful for optimising - on a constant
basis - not only the resources themselves but the
whole of the multilingual content production
process. Tags or flags, normally called content
properties, content attibutes or metadata, are
aimed at retrieving a content unit when necessary
and preventing loss of content. It is precisely
thanks to these attributes, often visualised to the
content repository into an external translation process,
and then returns in one or more new languages – a
further challenge, especially if there is not yet an
effective content management system in place.
user by means colours or other agreed
conventions, that a content management system
can manage content even if it moves across
multiple languages or sites.
Capturing that knowledge will thus be helpful
when developing scalable and adaptive
applications for managing corporate multilingual
content.
2.2 From LR4Trans to knowledge
repositories and content management
systems
A corporate knowledge-geared multilingual
content strategy is open to a varying degree of
automation, in terms of not only linguistic
processing but also in content transaction5
operations, on the basis of the type of
documentation, business conditioning factors, etc.
It usually combines tightly integrated translation
technologies (and maybe other kind of human
language technologies) with human specialist
intervention, i.e. unique6 language work
processes, which have to be driven by highly
skilled linguists.
This form of knowledge-based translation work
aims to bridge the gap between low cost, poor
output machine-only translation and costly high-
quality human-only translation. Although this
could be seen as a type of machine-aided human
translation (MAHT), we would like to emphasise
the issue of knowledge, corporate knowledge in
particular, which precisely ought to be captured
into the translation system’s knowledge base.
This corporate knowledge base, characterised
for being configurable and updatable, will detect
and classify the knowledge present in the
language resources into: general knowledge,
domain-specific knowledge and, knowledge
specific to each individual customer or
department within the organisation.
The knowledge base will nonetheless be acting
as a single repository with the following possible
functions7: automated identification of terms that
5 Transaction costs can outweigh translation costs,
especially when the creation and maintenance of
multilingual content is required for e-learning or e-
customer support.
6 Ideally tailor-made and customisable, that is,
conceived for the corporation or the client they work in
or for.
7 These functions will be linked to one another and
called according to the stage of multilingual content
creation we are in. A function or component may be
called more than once within the multilingual content
are candidates for once-only translation; spotting
of translation for terms from previously translated,
aligned texts; semi- or automated creation of
domain and/or customer-specific terminology,
dictionaries and glossaries; creation and regular
update of domain and/or customer-specific
language rules; implementation of domain and/or
customer-specific translation memories; dynamic
and integrative machine translation, making use of
customised dictionaries (lexicons) and language
rules; translation and edition application, ideally
increasing ease of use by showing colour-coded
aligned bi-texts (bilingual) or multi-texts
(multilingual) with a context expansion feature
and highlighting terminology; and, most
importantly, automated and user-dependant
feedback of new knowledge into the knowledge
base.
3 The envisaged scenario: workflows,
content management systems, and agents
Having the corporate knowledge base linked to
various LR4Trans, as presented in section 2
makes us think of a procedural and very agile
multilingual content workflow. But let us examine
it in greater detail starting to look at the simplest
of workflows first (figure 1):
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.912424">
Figure 1.- Typical Workflow diagram
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.996407">
Typically authors do not edit or approve content
for translation. The texts to translate, usually from
an unstructured document collection, are handed
over to the translator, who does translate without
having the chance to get feedback from the
authorship department. There is neither an
obvious use of language resources in machine-
readable form nor a corporate knowledge
detection and exploitation strategy in operation.
This poor production process will have negative
consequences in terms of the quality of the
product translation (e.g. lacking consistency,
production lifecycle.
frequent content losses, etc.) and costs,
particularly in the long run.
In order to streamline the procurement and
management of corporate multilingual content we
propose the following workflow (see figure 2 in
the appendix). Its main assets would be an overall
corporate knowledge base linked to various
LR4Trans, as appropriate, and maintained by all
agents8 intervening in the workflow, plus a
content management system, or CMS, that would
reflect the business roles controlling the
workflow, data production and update flow, user
roles and access privileges, costing rules, etc.
In contrast to figure 1, the following features
can be found in the workflow presented in figure
2:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.770319047619047">
• Cyclic nature of content, from
monolingual to multilingual, and back
to enhance and expand the first;
• Corporate content is traceable and its
state and structure can be followed-up
at all times;
• Authors are aware of what happens at
the other end, and so are capable of
“writing for translation”, that is, editing
or approving content that will be later
received by an audience or market of
another language and culture. In other
words, the package of the content starts
being taken care of from the beginning;
• Translators are connected with the
authoring department: the concepts of
content negotiation and feedback are
essential here. Translators, being
intercultural mediators, have a strong
say in issues of international content
relevancy.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999673666666667">
CMS are meant to work seamlessly in the
background, automatically identifying changes
in the content (e.g. keeping track of the content
production or processing stage, keeping a log of
agent participation, etc.) by means of a built-in
feedback loop mechanism. Besides, a
multilingual CMS comes to live action when, as
some kind of document gate keeper and donor,
passes on the content from one agent to another,
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.851113285714286">
8 By this we mean not only the multiskilled
corporate linguist (who could be a translator,
terminologist, editor, domain validator, cross-cultural
consultant...), but also all those agents that construct
and share the knowledge of a corporation, namely
decision makers (i.e. management force), marketeers,
legal specialists, and so on.

notifying him or her of any vital new piece of
information: “a new translation has been
received”, “glossary validated by expert XY
and saved today at 18:27 hours”, “not possible
to close up project before client acceptancy
test”.
CMS are usually dependant on the corporate
knowledge base. Together, they define the
workflow and have interaction capabilities with
the various users by means of secure interfaces,
usually very similar to a web portal for internal
and very often external use, too (mainly for
workers or at different sites and clients).
Concerning language work, it is extremely
important that both online and offline editing
and review of content are allowed. In other
words, the corporate knowledge base has to be
centralised (online use) and yet distributed at
times (offline use). It will be the system, which
will manage the synchronisation of content and
knowledge base alterations and updates across
all the different user types.
The CMS thus relies heavily upon automated
mechanisms (e.g. automatic updating of the
translation memory once the project translations
have gone through the review process) but
needs skilled human intervention to improve its
efficiency over time.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999694">
After introducing some commonplace
problematic issues surrounding the creation,
managing and leveraging of multilingual content,
we have analysed the interrelation of corporate
knowledge and language resources for translation
in a corporate setting. It has been argued that the
corporate knowledge residing in the corporation
documentation and language resources has to be
captured and introduced in a corporate knowledge
base, which has to be made accessible to and
constantly cared for by all agents intervening in
the multilingual content workflow, not only by
linguists. We have gone on to underline the
importance of having a content management
system in place, in order to account for and
dynamise the tasks and processes within the
workflow. Other relevant issues such as linkage
between resources, knowledge base and CMS,
and balance between automation and human
intervention have been discussed.
