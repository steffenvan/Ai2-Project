Conventional information systems can-
not cater for temporal information effec-
tively. For this reason, it is useful to cap-
ture and maintain the temporal knowl-
edge (especially the relative knowledge)
associated to each action in an informa-
tion system. In this paper, we propose a
model to mine and organize temporal re-
lations embedded in Chinese sentences.
Three kinds of event expressions are ac-
counted for, i.e. single event, multiple
events and declared event(s). Experi-
ments are conducted to evaluate the min-
ing algorithm using a set of news reports
and the results are significant. Error
analysis has also been performed open-
ing up new doors for future research.

Information Extraction (IE) is an upcoming chal-
lenging research area to cope with the increas-
ing volume of unwieldy distributed information re-
sources, such as information over WWW. Among
them, temporal information is regarded as an
equally, if not more, important piece of infor-
mation in domains where the task of extract-
ing and tracking information over time occurs
frequently, such as planning, scheduling and
question-answering. It may be as simple as an ex-
plicit or direct expression in a written language,
such as &amp;quot;the company closed down in May, 1997&amp;quot;;
or it may be left implicit, to be recovered by read-
ers from the surrounding texts. For example, one
may know the fact that &amp;quot;the company has closed
down before the earthquake&amp;quot;, yet without know-
ing the exact time of the bankruptcy. Relative
temporal knowledge such as this where the pre-
cise time is unavailable is typically determined by
human. An information system which does not
account for this properly is thus rather restrictive.
It is hard to separate temporal information (in
particular refers to temporal relations in this pa-
per) discovery from natural language processing.
In English, tenses and aspects reflected by differ-
ent verb forms are important elements in a sen-
tence for expressing temporal reference (Steed-
man, 97) and for transforming situations into
temporal logic operators (Bruce, 72). The pio-
neer work of Reichenbach (Reichenbach, 47) on
tenses forms the basis of many subsequent re-
search efforts in temporal natural language pro-
cessing, e.g. the work of Prior in tense logic (Prior,
67), and of Hwang et al in tense tree (Hwang
92) and temporal adverbial analysis (Hwang 94),
etc. Reichenbach argued that the tense system
provided predication over three underlying times,
namely S (speech time), R (reference time), and
E (event time). Later, a multiple temporal refer-
ences model was introduced by Bruce (Bruce, 72).
He defined the set (S1, S2, ..., Sn), which is an el-
ement of a tense. S1 corresponds to the time of
speech. Each Si (i = 2,..., n — 1) is a time of ref-
erence, and Sn, the time of an event. To facilitate
logic manipulation, Bruce proposed seven first or-
der logic relations based on time intervals and a
method to map nine English tenses into tempo-
ral first order logic expressions1. His work laid
down the foundation of temporal logic in natu-
ral language. These relations were then gradually
expanded to nine in (Allen, 81) and further to
thirteen in (Allen, 83)2.
In contrast, Chinese verbs appear in only one
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.5843435">
&apos;The seven relations are symbolized as R(A, B) for
relation R and time intervals A and B, where R in-
cludes before, after, during, contains, same-time, over-
laps or overlapped-by.
zmeet, met-by, starts, started-by, finishes and
finished-by are added into temporal relations.

form. The lack of regular morphological tense
markers renders Chinese temporal expressions
complicated. For quite a long time, linguists ar-
gued whether tenses existed in Chinese; and if
they did how are they expressed. We believe that
Chinese do have tenses. But they are determined
with the assistance of temporal adverbs and aspect
auxiliary words. For example, A ... pJ (being), E,
2 ... 7 (was/been) and T- ... (will be) express an
ongoing action, a situation started or finished in
the past, and a situation which will occur in the
future, respectively. Therefore, the conventional
theory to determine temporal information based
on verb affixations is inapplicable. Over the past
years, there has been considerable progress in the
areas of information extraction and temporal logic
in English (Antony, 87; Bruce, 72; Kaufmann, 97).
Nevertheless, only a few researchers have investi-
gated these areas in Chinese.
The objective of our research is to design and
develop a temporal information extraction sys-
tem. For practical and cultural reason, the appli-
cation target is on-line financial news in Chinese.
The final system, referred to as TICS (Tempo-
ral Information-extraction from Chinese Sources),
will accept a series of Chinese financial texts as in-
put, analyze each sentence one by one to extract
the desirable temporal information, represent each
piece of information in a concept frame, link all
frames together in chronological order based on
inter- or intra-event relations, and finally apply
this linked knowledge to fulfill users&apos; queries.
In this paper, we introduce a fundamental
model of TICS, which is designed to mine and
organize temporal relations embedded in Chinese
sentences. Three kinds of event expressions are
accounted for, i.e. single event, multiple events
and declared event(s). This work involved four
major parts, (1) built temporal model; (2) con-
structed rules sets; (3) developed the algorithm;
and (4) set up the experiments and performed the
evaluation.

2.1 Temporal Concept Frame
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954041666666">
In IE, it is impossible as well as impractical to
extract all the information from an incoming doc-
ument. For this reason, all IE systems are geared
for specific application domains. The domain is
determined by a pre-specified concept dictionary.
Then a certain concept is triggered by several lex-
ical items and activated in the specific linguistic
contexts. Each concept definition contains a set
of slots for the extracted information. In addition,
it contains a set of enabling conditions which are
constraints that must be satisfied in order for the
concept to be activated. Due to its versatility, a
frame structure is generally used to represent con-
cepts (as shown in Figure 1).
Slots in a temporal concept frame are divided
into two types: activity-related and time-related.
Activity-related slots provide the descriptions of
objects and actions concerning the concept. For
example, company predator, company target and
purchase value are the attributes of the concept
(�k j3j, TAKEOVER). Meanwhile, time-related
slots provide information related to when a con-
cept begins or finishes, how long does it last and
how does it relate to another concept, etc.

The system is designed with two sets of temporal
relations, namely absolute and relative relations.
The role of absolute temporal relations is to posi-
tion situation occurrences on a time axis. These
relations depict the beginning and/or ending time
bounds of an occurrence or its relevance to refer-
ence times, see TR(T) in Section 2.3. Absolute
relations are organized by Time Line in the sys-
tem, see Figure 2.

<bodyText confidence="0.999935285714286">
This section describes our temporal model for
discovering relations from Chinese sentences.
Suppose TR indicates a temporal relation, E
indicates an event and T indicates time. The
absolute and relative relations are symbolized as:
OCCUR(Ei, TR(T))3 and TR(Ei, Ej), respec-
tively. The sets of TR are:

an indispensable parameter, which includes event

<footnote confidence="0.995000833333333">
3OCCUR is a predicate for the happening of a sin-

Some Chinese words can function as the tem-
poral indicators. These include time word (TW),
time position word (F), temporal adverb (ADV ),
auxiliary word (AUX), preposition word (P),
auxiliary verb (V A), trend verb (V C) and some
special verbs (V V ). They are all regarded as the
elements of the temporal indicator TI:
TI = {TW, F, ADV, AUX, V A, V C, V V, P}
Each type of the indicators, e.g. TW, con-
tains a set of words, such as TW = twlist =
{tw1, tw2, ...twn1, with each word having an tem-
poral attribute, indicated by ATT.
The core of the model is thus a rule set R
which maps the combinational effects of all the
indicators, TI, in a sentence to its corresponding
temporal relation, TR,

Some general temporal characteristics, approxi-

to polish the identified solutions in order to make
them more nature. For example, PAST(4KwH

3.2 Impact Coefficients of Temporal
Indicators (R0)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909789473684">
The combined effect of all the temporal indica-
tors in a sentence determines its temporal rela-
tion. However, in different situations, a certain
indicator may have different effects. Compared
(a) ˜��ÞTA�ê4K� (This morning, he read
the newspaper) and (b) VF:T�,A1êÜ*V (I read
two books yesterday), the two sentences are alike
as they both embody an indicator ê, which im-
plies PAST in principle. The sole difference is
that a definite time present in (b). (a) means the
reading is finished at the speech time and the per-
son must have known some news or information
from his reading. Thus TR = PAST(ts) for (a).
However, (b) means the event took place yester-
day but not before yesterday. Consequently, for
(b), TR = ON(H�:T�,, yesterday) is appropriate. In
the database, the impact coefficients are defined
for the temporal indicators when T does or does
not present in the sentence.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.527572" genericHeader="method">
Remark:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999540416666667">
It is likely for a sentence to contain two or
more indicators. For example, adverbs E2 and
aspectual auxiliary word ê together express a
past tense and they both share the same reference
time tr. The same kind instances includeR...�
(will) and iE...* (being) etc. Another example,
such as )? qg E2 (before the National Day,
one has already), however includes two reference
times. Here, )? (National Day) is tr, location
word qg (before) indicates PAST between tr and
t�r (i.e. t�r &lt; tr), and adverb E2 indicates the
same relativity but between te and t�r (i.e. te &lt; t�r).

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999709285714286">
The current proposed algorithm is unable to
mine the implicit reference time (i.e. t�r). But
this does not affect the work at all. It does not
matter even we cannot discover a relation like
PAST(t�r). As we know t�r &lt; tr and te &lt; t�r,
we can deduce a conclusion such as te &lt; tr by
rule PAST(t�r)(DPAST(tr) ) PAST(tr) (for te).
Thus, for this example, a relation of PAST ()?,
National Day) is enough to provide sufficient in-
formation to the users. To cater for these cases,
we define a general rule: if all the indicators in
a sentence indicate the same relation, then it is
identified as TR (hereafter this rule together with
impact coefficients is referred as R0).

3.3 Rules for Resolving Conflicts (R1)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974706583333333">
In many situations, the indicators in a sentence
may introduce more than one relation. For exam-
ple, adverbs E2 (have already) and A (being)
indicate PAST and ONGING, respectively. But
they could be collocated to represent some event
which began in the past and continued to the
reference time. For example TA E2 A 44K (He
has been reading newspaper). Such a problem is
regarded as conflict. In the following, five cases
are illustrated with examples. To resolve this

To express two relevant events is straightforward.
In general, one of them is treated as the reference
event, say El, which is expressed by the subordi-

concerned, is expression by the main clause. The
position words (F), such as qg (before) and )i� (af-
ter), and some special nouns, such as Hfl!�, (when)
and Afol (during) between the two event expres-
sions play an important role in determining their
relevance in time. Also, it is noticed that the im-
pact of TR(E2) cannot be ignored. Practically,
TR(E2) relates E2 to ts or E1. Especially for the
latter, the influence of TR(E2) is indispensable.
The rules for this are being defined in the rule set
R2. In addition, some special templates are also
necessary for relating two event, which are being
defined in the rule set R3, when F is absent.

month of financial pages of « (Ta Kung
Bao). In total, 7924 temporal relations are discov-
ered from the data. The distribution of temporal
relations in test data is shown in Table 4. Consid-
ering the ultimate objective of this research is to
find out the temporal relations embedded in sen-
tences, the focus of the evaluation is therefore to
figure out the number of the temporal relations of
single event (i.e. TR(E)) and of multiple events
(i.e. TR(Ei, Ej)), which are correctly marked by
the program. Table 5 shows the results. Table 6
gives the order of TR classified by the program.
After analyzing the outputs, it was discovered
that most errors were due to:
(1) t as a noun modifier;
Since the proposed method does not integrate
the mechanism of parsing, the association be-
tween a modifier and its corresponding modifyee
is not clear. In view of the task engaged, a time
expression (indicated by t) could either modify
a verb as an adverb, or modify a noun as a re-
stricted modifier. Only the adverb t, determines
the temporal reference of the event described by
the verb. Thus, the mistake is unavoidable when
a noun modifier t appears in the text.

The program searches for a solution within a
sentence bounded by a full stop. As the con-
nections between two sentences are ignored, it is
incapable to resolve the coreference problem. As
such, the following two sentences are all identified
as TR = PAST, which is acceptable for the first
and correct for the second. Nevertheless, since 3
H� links the current event to the event described
in the last sentence (indicated by ?), a solution
of SAME AS(?,z�) would be more accurate.
Similarly, BEFORE( ?,Añ) is more proper in
the second sentence with �L refering to the event
stated before. The problem of coreference will be
studied in our future work.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999828529411765">
The issues of mapping linguistic patterns to tem-
poral relations are addressed in the paper. These
mapping is preconditioned on the temporal in-
dicators and achieved on a set of pre-defined
rules. The mapping mechanism was validated. On
7429 sentences describing temporal relevance, we
achieved 92.77% accuracy in average.
These relations will be useful to for information
extraction, information retrieval and question-
answering application. Once the corresponding
frames have been instantiated and their slots filled
after temporal natural language processing. The
related temporal concepts will be linked together
according to their chronological orders, to be ap-
plied as the knowledge to fulfill users&apos; queries.
We find two interest questions as our future
work.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.733243">
(1) Reference Time Shift
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989688789473684">
In the current work, we considered sentences as in-
dependent units. The evaluation is also performed
on this basis. However, some sentences in a article
may be temporally related. They may share the
same reference time which is indicated in a pre-
ceding sentence or the event time in one sentence
servers as a reference point for the next. How
to identify whether a reference time is continued
from the preceding sentence or is the same as a
omitted speech time, and how the reference times
shift should be a good topic in the future work.
(2) The focus of Negation
The negation form of a verb may have two focuses.
One emphasizes the event, which is expected to
become the fact but, still has not yet happened.
It implies that the event will take place in the fu-
ture. Another emphasizes a status where the event
didn&apos;t happen throughout a specified duration. Is
it possible to find out the focus of the negation?

<abstract confidence="0.997458833333333">Conventional information systems cannot cater for temporal information effectively. For this reason, it is useful to capture and maintain the temporal knowledge (especially the relative knowledge) associated to each action in an information system. In this paper, we propose a model to mine and organize temporal relations embedded in Chinese sentences. Three kinds of event expressions are accounted for, i.e. single event, multiple events and declared event(s). Experiments are conducted to evaluate the mining algorithm using a set of news reports and the results are significant. Error analysis has also been performed opening up new doors for future research.</abstract>
