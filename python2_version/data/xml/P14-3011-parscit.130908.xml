Open Information Extraction (Open IE)
serves for the analysis of vast amounts of
texts by extraction of assertions, or rela-
tions, in the form of tuples (argument 1;
relation; argument 2). Various approaches
to Open IE have been designed to per-
form in a fast, unsupervised manner. All
of them require language specific infor-
mation for their implementation. In this
work, we introduce an approach to Open
IE based on syntactic constraints over POS
tag sequences targeted at Spanish lan-
guage. We describe the rules specific for
Spanish language constructions and their
implementation in EXTRHECH, an Open
IE system for Spanish. We also discuss
language-specific issues of implementa-
tion. We compare EXTRHECH’s perfor-
mance with that of REVERB, a similar
Open IE system for English, on a paral-
lel dataset and show that these systems
perform at a very similar level. We also
compare EXTRHECH’s performance on a
dataset of grammatically correct sentences
against its performance on a dataset of ran-
dom texts extracted from the Web, drasti-
cally different in their quality from the first
dataset. The latter experiment shows ro-
bustness of EXTRHECH on texts from the
Web.

Open IE is a rapidly developing area in text pro-
cessing, with its own applications and approaches
that are different from traditional IE (Etzioni et
al., 2008; Banko and Etzioni, 2008; Etzioni,
2011). Unlike traditional IE, where systems are

tic classes, e.g., to be born in(HUMAN; LOCA-
TION), Open IE serves for extraction of all pos-
sible relations with arbitrary arguments. For ex-
ample, in “Woman who drove van full of kids is
charged with attempted murder” two relations can
be identified: (Woman; drove; van full of kids) and
(Woman; is charged with; attempted murder).
The ability to extract arbitrary relations from
text allows applications of Open IE that are not
possible in the frame of traditional IE. Among
them are fact extraction at sentence level (e.g.,
(Mozart; was born in; Salzburg)), new perspective
on search as question answering (e.g., Where was
Mozart born?) (Etzioni, 2011), or assessment of
the quality of text documents at Web scale (Horn
et al., 2013). Additionally, the output of Open IE
systems can serve for ontology population (Soder-
land et al., 2010) and acquisition of common sense
knowledge (Lin et al., 2010).
Although all Open IE systems are targeted at the
extraction of arbitrary relations, the approaches to
this task vary significantly. The pilot approach
suggested by Banko et al. (2007) is based on
semi-supervised learning of general relation pat-
terns that then serve for extraction of arbitrary
relations. However, the output of such systems
contains many incoherent and inconsistent extrac-
tions, and the training stage is quite computation-
ally complex. Fader et al. (2011) suggested an-
other approach where syntactic and lexical con-
straints were applied over POS-tagged input. This
approach has proven to be robust and fast enough
for relation extraction at Web scale.
Although Open IE is targeted at extraction of
arbitrary relations without any semantic restric-
tions, all approaches have strong language de-
pendent restrictions and require language spe-
cific information to be introduced in the corre-
sponding systems. For Spanish language, the
apporach based on rules over dependency trees
has been implemented both using full parsing

mer work shows that this approach is too com-
putationally costly and is not always robust even
on grammatically correct texts. The latter work
does not report any results for Spanish language or
discusses any details specific to implementations
for languages other than English. Further, we are
not aware of any existing research on whether the
approach based on syntactic constraints over POS
tags can be generalized to other languages. Ad-

ful for information extraction from the Web, we
are not aware of any research on its applicability
to texts randomly extracted from the Internet, i.e.,
those that have not been verified for grammatical
correctness by peers or editors.
In this paper we discuss Open IE based on syn-
tactic constraints over POS tag sequences, aimed
at Spanish language. We describe its implemen-
tation and introduce EXTRHECH, an Open IE sys-
tem for Spanish. We also compare its performance
with that of REVERB (Fader et al., 2011) on a
parallel dataset. Additionally, we evaluate perfor-
mance of our system over a dataset of texts ran-
domly extracted from the Internet and discuss the
issues that arise when processing random Internet
texts. We also give a brief analysis of errors.
The paper is organized as follows. Related work
is reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 presents our
approach to Open IE for Spanish and describes
the EXTRHECH system. Section 4 describes the
experiments for a parallel English-Spanish dataset

analysis of errors is presented. Section 6 draws

There exist several approaches to Open IE.
Chronologically the first one was introduced
in the pilot works on Open IE by Banko et al.
(2007) and Etzioni et al. (2008). Their approach is
based on semi-supervised machine learning prin-
ciples and includes three main steps: (1) man-
ual labeling of a training corpus for seed relation
phrases and features; (2) further semi-supervised
learning of relations; (3) automatic extractions of
relations and their arguments. This approach is
implemented in TEXTRUNNER (Banko and Et-
zioni, 2008), WOEpos, and WOEparse, both (Wu
and Weld, 2010). In these systems, the detection
of a relation triple starts from the potential argu-
ments expressed as noun phrases, i.e., before the
connecting relation phrase is detected. Once de-
tected, neither the argument phrases nor the rela-
tion phrase can be backtracked, which makes the
approach prone to incoherent and uninformative
extractions. For example, in “to make a deal with”,
deal can be erroneously extracted as an argument,
although it is a part of the relation phrase.
The group of rule-based approaches includes
systems based on rules applied over linguisti-
cally annotated texts. FES-2012 system (Aguilar-
Galicia, 2012) applies rules to the fully parsed sen-
tences. However, in the same work the authors
show that this approach is too slow to be scaled to
a Web-sized corpus and that it is not robust. An-
other system implementing rule-based approach is
DEPOE (Gamallo et al., 2012). In this system, the
rules are applied to the output of shallow depen-
dency parsing. In REVERB system (Fader et al.,
2011), syntactic constraints are applied over POS
tags and syntactic chunks. The last two systems
show better results in terms of precision/recall and
speed, and, consequently, scalability to a Web-
sized corpus.
Finally, the approach based on the deep au-
tomatic linguistic analysis is implemented in
OLLIE (Mausam et al., 2012). This system com-
bines various approaches: it uses output of a rule-
based Open IE system to bootstrap learning of the
relation patterns and then additionally applies lex-
ical and semantic patterns to extract relations that
are not expessed through verb phrases. Such a
complex approach leads to high-precision results
with a high yield. However, there is a tradeoff be-
tween accuracy of the output and cost of imple-
mentation and computation and complexity of the
training stage.
All these approaches require language-
dependent information for their implementation.
The third approach directly uses lexical infor-
mation for the context analysis. The other two
approaches employ language-specific morpholog-
ical and syntactic information. Of the described
systems, only two have been implemented for
languages other than English. FES-2012 system
is implemented for Spanish language; however,
its use of the full syntactic parsing does not scale
to a Web-sized corpus. DEPOE system, based on
rules over shallow dependency parsing, is claimed
</bodyText>

to have its variants for Spanish, Portuguese, and
Galician languages (Gamallo et al., 2012). How-
ever, the authors do not report any experimental
results on languages other than English or any
language-specific details.
The approach based on syntactic constraints
over POS tags has not been applied to languages
other than English, in spite of that this method
can be easily adapted to other languages because it
only requires a reliable POS tagger. The basic al-
gorithm for relation extraction, according to Fader
et al. (2011), is as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9912595">
• First, search for a verb-containing relation
phrase in a sentence;
• If detected, search for a noun phrase to the
left of the relation phrase;
• If a noun phrase detected, search for another
noun phrase to the right of the relation phrase.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962125">
Additionally, the experiments for Open IE sys-
tems have been conducted only on texts that came
from verified sources, i.e., Wikipedia, news, or
textbooks (Banko and Etzioni, 2008; Fader et al.,
2011; Mausam et al., 2012). However, Open IE is
meant to work with Web text data that may come
from any source including those that have not been
edited or verified for grammar errors.

3 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939666666667">
In this section we introduce EXTRHECH,1 a sys-
tem for Open IE in Spanish. It takes a POS-tagged
text as input, applies syntactic constraints over se-
quences of POS-tags, and returns a list of extracted
relations as triples (argument 1; relation; argu-
ment 2) that correspond to each sentence.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999327">
3.1 Basic Processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967561717948718">
The system takes as input a POS-tagged text. In
our experiemnts, we used a morphological ana-
lyzer from Freeling-2.2 (Padr´o et al., 2010). For
Spanish language, it returns POS tags accoridng to
EAGLES POS tag set (Leech and Wilson, 1999).
Consequently, our system is designed to work with
this POS tag set.
Spanish uses a number of non-ASCII charac-
ters, such as ´a, ´e, ˜n, etc. These characters can
come in different encodings. To be able to cor-
rectly analyze text with these characters, Freeling

analyzer should receive the input in ISO encod-
ing. Thus, the input text needs an additional pre-
processing stage to be converted into this encod-
ing. Though this might look as a minor technical
issue, guessing the original encoding becomes a
significant problem when working with texts from
arbitrary sources on the Web. We discuss encoding
related issues in Section 4.2.
After the text has been properly POS-tagged,
we feed it into EXTRHECH system, which ap-
plies the fact extraction algorithm described in
Section 2 to each sentence, one sentence at a time.
We use the same basic algorithm as in (Fader et
al., 2011) but with different triple matching rules
as appropriate for Spanish grammar.
The original POS-tag sequences for English
would produce nonsense results on Spanish input
due to substantial difference in grammars: infini-
tives are not preceded by “to”, adjectives usually
follow nouns, and oblique case pronouns precede
verbs instead of following them, just to name a few
peculiarities of Spanish.
First, the system looks for a verb-containing
phrase in a sentence by matching it against the fol-
lowing expression:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.869342">
VREL —* (V W* P)  |(V),
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999728">
where V stands either for a single verb optionally
preceded by a reflexive pronoun (se realizaron,
“were carried out”), or a participle (calificado,
“qualified”). V W* P matches a verb with depen-
dent words, where W stands for either a noun, an
adjective, an adverb, a pronoun, or an article, and
P stands either for a preposition optionally imme-
diately followed by an infinitive, or for a gerund
(sigue siendo, “continues to be”). The symbol
* denotes zero or more matches. Here and fur-
ther, the whole match is referred to as verb phrase
(though it is not a verb phrase in linguistic sense).
After detecting a verb phrase, EXTRHECH
looks for a noun phrase to the left from the be-
ginning of the verb phrase. This noun phrase is a
potential first argument of the relation. If a match
is found, then the system looks for another noun
phrase to the right from the end of the verb phrase.
The noun on the right side is treated as the second
argument.
Noun phrases are searched for with the follow-
ing regular expression:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.534509">
NP —* Np (PREP Np)?,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997123">
where Np matches a noun optionally preceded by
either an article (la din´amica, “the dynamics”),
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.985537">

<bodyText confidence="0.999942961538462">
an adjective, an ordinal number (los primeros
ganadores, “the first winners”), a number (3 casas,
“3 houses”), or their combination, and optionally
followed by either a single adjective (un esfuerzo
criminal, “a criminal effort”), a single participle,
or both (los documentos escritos antiguos, “the
ancient written documents”). The whole expres-
sion matched by Np can be preceded by an indef-
inite determinant construction, e.g., uno de, “one
of”. PREP matches a single preposition. Hence,
an entire noun phrase is either a single noun with
optional modifiers or a noun with optional modi-
fiers followed by a prepositional phrase that is a
preposition and another noun with its correspond-
ing optional modifiers (una larga lista de proble-
mas actuales, “a long list of current problems”).
The symbol ? denotes 0 or 1 matches.
If noun phrases are matched on both sides of the
verb phrase, all three components are considered
to represent a relation and are extracted in the form
of a triple.
As an output unit, EXTRHECH returns a triple
consisting of (argument 1; relation; argument 2),
where argument 1 semantically is, e.g., an agent
or experiencer of the relation and argument 2 is a
general object or circumstance of the relation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998645">
3.2 Additional Processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939555555556">
Above we described the core rules and the basic
sequence for relation extraction. In addition to
them, we also implemented several optional rules
for processing of certain language constructions
that can be turned on and off with the input pa-
rameters.
First, participle clauses that follow a noun can
be searched for a relational triple if they terminate
with a noun. For example, from a phrase
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.5566576">
Precios del caf´e suministrados por la OIC
(“Coffee prices provided by International Coffee
Organization”)
EXTRHECH returns the relation:
(Precios del caf´e; suministrados por; la OIC).
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.8439907">
Second, EXTRHECH also approaches resolu-
tion of coordinating conjunctions between verb
phrases and between noun phrases into corre-
sponding separate relations. Here follows the ex-
ample of a sentence with a coordinating conjunc-
tion between verb phrases:
El cerebro almacena enormes cantidades de informaci´on y
realiza millones de actividades todos los d´ıas
(“The brain stores vast amounts of information and performs
millions of activities every day”)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.3943535">
. Two facts are detected:
(El cerebro; almacena enormes cantidades de; informaci´on)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.885079363636364">
and
(El cerebro; realiza millones de; actividades todos los dias).
Third, relative clauses introduced by single rel-
ative pronouns (e.g., que (“that”, “who”), cual
(“which”)) as in las partes que conforman un
trabajo de investigaci´on (“parts that make up a
research work”) are also searched for relations.
However, relative pronoun phrases with preposi-
tions, e.g. en el cual (“in which”) are not taken into
consideration for relation extraction due to their
coreferential complexity.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99551">
3.3 Limitations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987988138888889">
The implementation of basic processing per-
formed by EXTRHECH system follows the algo-
rithm introduced in (Fader et al., 2011). This
means that extracted facts are limited to the rela-
tions expressed through a verb phrase. This limi-
tation is discussed in the cited paper.
In our apporach to Open IE in Spanish, we do
not allow pronouns to be potential arguments of
a relation. It was mainly done because of a wide
use of a neutral pronoun lo (“this”, “which”, or no
direct translation) as a head of relative clauses in
Spanish language, e.g., lo que dio valor al poder
judicial (“ that gave value to the judiciary”). In-
cluding pronouns for potential argument matches
would return a lot of uninformative relations as
(lo; dio valor a; el poder judicial). This issue can
be solved only by introducing anaphora resolution
techniques which involves processing on a super-
sentence level. Although seemingly feasible, this
modification will necessarily slow down the ex-
traction speed which is critical while working with
large scale corpora. As mentioned in Section 2,
high speed performance is one of the main advan-
tages of the approach to Open IE based on syntac-
tis constraints compared to the others. Hence, any
modifications that would affect its speed should be
considered with caution.
Another language dependent limitation is re-
lated to the order of the processing. As
earlier described in Section 3.1, an extracted
triple is expected to correspond semantically
to (agent/experiencer; relation; general ob-
ject/circumstance). This is expected to be cor-
rect for a direct word order, i.e., Subject – Verb
– (Indirect) Object, which is a dominant word or-
der for Spanish. Yet the inverted word order, i.e.

(Indirect) Object – Verb – Subject (e.g., De la
m´edula espinal nacen los nervios perif´ericos, i.e.,
literally *“From the spinal cord arise peripheral
nerves”), also occasionally takes place in gram-
matically correct and stylistically neutral Spanish
texts. However, the occurence of this construction
is less then 10% according to (Clements, 2006).

<bodyText confidence="0.999974684210526">
We compare EXTRHECH’s performance with that
of REVERB, an Open IE system for English based
on the same algorithm (Fader et al., 2011). Since
these systems are designed for different languages,
we ran our experiment on a parallel dataset.1
We took 300 parallel sentences from the
English-Spanish part of News Commentary Cor-
pus (Callison-Burch et al., 2011). Then, we ran
the extractors over the corresponding languages.
After that, two human annotators labeled each ex-
traction as correct or incorrect. For the Spanish
part of the dataset, the annotators agreed on 80%
of extractions (Cohen’s kappa n = 0.60), whereas
for the English part they agreed on 85% of extrac-
tions with n = 0.68. For both datasets their respec-
tive n coefficients indicate substantial agreement
between the annotators.
Precision was calculated as a fraction of correct
extractions among all returned extractions. We
calculated Recall as a fraction of all returned cor-
rect extractions among all possible (i.e., expected)
correct extractions. By manual revision of the sen-
tences in the datasets, we made a list of all ex-
pected correct extractions. Their number was used
to estimate the recall.
In contrast to REVERB, our system does not
have a confidence score mechnaism at this point.
To make the comparison between the systems ap-
propriate, we ran REVERB extractor with the con-
fidence score level set to 0 that means that the sys-
tem returns all relations that match the rules, i.e.,
in the same way as EXTRHECH does. Hence, the
systems were in equivalent conditions. The results
of the experiment are shown in Table 1.
As we see, on a parallel dataset of texts from
News Commentary Corpus, both systems show a
very similar performance. Based on this observa-
tion, we can conclude that the algorithm suggested

4.2 Experiment on Raw Web dataset
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910641025641">
One of the most important goals of Open IE sys-
tems is to be able to process large amounts of texts
directly from the Web. This requires high per-
formance speed and robustness on texts that of-
ten lack grammatical and orthographical correct-
ness or coherence. The study showing the ap-
proach’s advantage in speed was already presented
in (Fader et al., 2011). In this work we focused on
robustness. We evaluated the performance of our
system on a dataset of sentences extracted from
the Internet “as is”. For this dataset, we took
200 random data chunks detected by a sentence
splitter from CommonCrawl 2012 corpus (Kirk-
patrick, 2011), which is a collection of web texts
crawled from over 5 billion web pages. However,
41 from those 200 chunks were not samples of
textual information in human language but rather
pieces of programming codes or numbers. We
took out these chunks because they are not rele-
vant for our research. In a real life scenario they
could be easily detected and eliminated from the
Web data stream. After this, our dataset consisted
of 159 sentences written in human language. We
will refer to this dataset as Raw Web text dataset.1
Of 159 sentences of the dataset, 36 sentences (22%
of the dataset) were grammatically incorrect or in-
coherent, as evaluated by a professional linguist.
We ran EXTRHECH system over this dataset
and asked two human judges to label extractions
as correct or incorrect. The annotators agreed on
70% of extractions with Cohen’s n = 0.40, which
indicates the lower bound of moderate agreement
between judges.
Precision and Recall were calculated in the
same manner as described in Section 4.1. We com-
pare these numbers to the results obtained for the
dataset of grammatically correct sentences from
News Commentary Corpus in Table 2.
We can observe that system’s performence has

matically correct dataset and the dataset of noisy
sentences extracted from the Web
not lowered significantly when processing “noisy”
texts compared to edited newspaper texts. An in-
teresting observation is that texts from the Internet
are poorer in facts than the news texts. The num-
ber of expected extractions was manually evalu-
ated by a human expert for both datasets. The ra-
tio of extractions to sentences for the news dataset
was 1.5:1, while for the Raw Web dataset it was
only 1.03:1.
Now we will briefly discuss the issue arising
due to various encoding standards used for non-
ASCII characters, e.g., of ´a, ´e, ˜n, etc. While apply-
ing Freeling morphological analyzer to the dataset,
we encountered an issue that the sentences came
in various encodings. As we mentioned in Sec-
tion 3, Freeling-2.2 analyzer works properly only
with ISO encoded input. Therefore, we had to
convert each sentence from the dataset into ISO
encoding. While most of the sentences were in
UTF-8 encoding and were converted in a single
pass, the encoding of about 3% of the sentences
was initially corrupted, therefore, they were not
processed correctly by the POS-tagger. Although
the issue is manageable at the scale of a small
dataset, it might affect the speed and quality of fact
extraction when working at Web scale.

After running EXTRHECH on the datasets, we an-

the classifications of the types of errors and their

The distribution of the errors in EXTRHECH’s out-
put over the types of errors is shown in Table 3.
The data about error types was gathered over ex-
tractions from Raw Web dataset. When errors are
present both in the arguments and in the relation
phrase, they are likely to have the same cause.

Inverse word order is one of the main causes for
the incorrect order of arguments in extracted rela-
tions. However, as it can be seen in Table 3, this
is the least common type of errors, which is in ac-
cordance to the low frecuency of the inverse word
order (Clements, 2006). A more detailed analysis
of the issues that cause the errors can be found in

<bodyText confidence="0.999996388888889">
We have introduced an approach to Open IE based
on syntactic constraints over POS tag sequences
targeted at Spanish language. We described the
rules for relation phrases and their arguments in
Spanish and their implementation in EXTRHECH
system. Further, we presented a series of ex-
periments with EXTRHECH and showed (1) that
the performance of this approach to Open IE
is similar for English and Spanish, and (2) that
EXTRHECH’s performance is robust on texts of
varying quality. We also gave a brief classification
of errors by their types and causes.
Our future plans include implementation of
shallow parsing and syntactic n-grams (Sidorov
et al., 2012; Sidorov et al., 2013; Sidorov et al.,
2014; Sidorov, 2013a; Sidorov, 2013b), as well as
learning techniques, and analysis of their influence
on the system’s performance.

The latter experiment shows robustness of EXTRHECH on texts from the Web. 1 Introduction Open IE is a rapidly developing area in text processing, with its own applications and approaches that are different from traditional IE (Etzioni et al., 2008; Banko and Etzioni, 2008; Etzioni, 2011). Unlike traditional IE, where systems are targeted at extraction of instances of particular relations with arguments restricted to certain semanAlexander Gelbukh Centro de Investigaci´on en Computaci´on, Instituto Polit´ecnico Nacional, 07738, Mexico City, Mexico gelbukh@gelbukh.com tic classes, e.g., to be born in(HUMAN; LOCATION), Open IE serves for extraction of all possible relations with arbitrary arguments. For example, in “Woman who drove van full of kids is charged with attempted murder” two relations can be identified: (Woman; drove; van full of kids) and (Woman; is c</context>

Section 6 draws the conclusions and outlines future work. 2 Related Work There exist several approaches to Open IE. Chronologically the first one was introduced in the pilot works on Open IE by Banko et al. (2007) and Etzioni et al. (2008). Their approach is based on semi-supervised machine learning principles and includes three main steps: (1) manual labeling of a training corpus for seed relation phrases and features; (2) further semi-supervised learning of relations; (3) automatic extractions of relations and their arguments. This approach is implemented in TEXTRUNNER (Banko and Etzioni, 2008), WOEpos, and WOEparse, both (Wu and Weld, 2010). In these systems, the detection of a relation triple starts from the potential arguments expressed as noun phrases, i.e., before the connecting relation phrase is detected. Once detected, neither the argument phrases nor the relation phrase can be backtracked, which makes the approach prone to incoherent and uninformative extractions. For example, in “to make a deal with”, deal can be erroneously extracted as an argument, although it is a part of the relation phrase. The group of rule-based approaches includes systems based on rules applied ove</context>
<context position="9666" citStr="Banko and Etzioni, 2008" startWordPosition="1536" endWordPosition="1539"> of that this method can be easily adapted to other languages because it only requires a reliable POS tagger. The basic algorithm for relation extraction, according to Fader et al. (2011), is as follows: • First, search for a verb-containing relation phrase in a sentence; • If detected, search for a noun phrase to the left of the relation phrase; • If a noun phrase detected, search for another noun phrase to the right of the relation phrase. Additionally, the experiments for Open IE systems have been conducted only on texts that came from verified sources, i.e., Wikipedia, news, or textbooks (Banko and Etzioni, 2008; Fader et al., 2011; Mausam et al., 2012). However, Open IE is meant to work with Web text data that may come from any source including those that have not been edited or verified for grammar errors. 3 System Description In this section we introduce EXTRHECH,1 a system for Open IE in Spanish. It takes a POS-tagged text as input, applies syntactic constraints over sequences of POS-tags, and returns a list of extracted relations as triples (argument 1; relation; argument 2) that correspond to each sentence. 3.1 Basic Processing The system takes as input a POS-tagged text.

Among them are fact extraction at sentence level (e.g., (Mozart; was born in; Salzburg)), new perspective on search as question answering (e.g., Where was Mozart born?) (Etzioni, 2011), or assessment of the quality of text documents at Web scale (Horn et al., 2013). Additionally, the output of Open IE systems can serve for ontology population (Soderland et al., 2010) and acquisition of common sense knowledge (Lin et al., 2010). Although all Open IE systems are targeted at the extraction of arbitrary relations, the approaches to this task vary significantly. The pilot approach suggested by Banko et al. (2007) is based on semi-supervised learning of general relation patterns that then serve for extraction of arbitrary relations. However, the output of such systems contains many incoherent and inconsistent extractions, and the training stage is quite computationally complex. Fader et al. (2011) suggested another approach where syntactic and lexical constraints were applied over POS-tagged input. This approach has proven to be robust and fast enough for relation extraction at Web scale.

Then, we ran the extractors over the corresponding languages. After that, two human annotators labeled each extraction as correct or incorrect. For the Spanish part of the dataset, the annotators agreed on 80% of extractions (Cohen’s kappa n = 0.60), whereas for the English part they agreed on 85% of extractions with n = 0.68. For both datasets their respective n coefficients indicate substantial agreement between the annotators. Precision was calculated as a fraction of correct extractions among all returned extractions.

We also compare EXTRHECH’s performance on a dataset of grammatically correct sentences against its performance on a dataset of random texts extracted from the Web, drastically different in their quality from the first dataset. The latter experiment shows robustness of EXTRHECH on texts from the Web. 1 Introduction Open IE is a rapidly developing area in text processing, with its own applications and approaches that are different from traditional IE (Etzioni et al., 2008; Banko and Etzioni, 2008; Etzioni, 2011). Unlike traditional IE, where systems are targeted at extraction of instances of particular relations with arguments restricted to certain semanAlexander Gelbukh Centro de Investigaci´on en Computaci´on, Instituto Polit´ecnico Nacional, 07738, Mexico City, Mexico gelbukh@gelbukh.com tic classes, e.g., to be born in(HUMAN; LOCATION), Open IE serves for extraction of all possible relations with arbitrary arguments.

Although all Open IE systems are targeted at the extraction of arbitrary relations, the approaches to this task vary significantly. The pilot approach suggested by Banko et al. (2007) is based on semi-supervised learning of general relation patterns that then serve for extraction of arbitrary relations. However, the output of such systems contains many incoherent and inconsistent extractions, and the training stage is quite computationally complex. Fader et al. (2011) suggested another approach where syntactic and lexical constraints were applied over POS-tagged input. This approach has proven to be robust and fast enough for relation extraction at Web scale. Although Open IE is targeted at extraction of arbitrary relations without any semantic restrictions, all approaches have strong language dependent restrictions and require language specific information to be introduced in the corresponding systems. For Spanish language, the apporach based on rules over dependency trees has been implemented both using full parsing 78 Proceedings of the ACL 2014 Student</context>

Additionally, although Open IE is claimed to be useful for information extraction from the Web, we are not aware of any research on its applicability to texts randomly extracted from the Internet, i.e., those that have not been verified for grammatical correctness by peers or editors. In this paper we discuss Open IE based on syntactic constraints over POS tag sequences, aimed at Spanish language. We describe its implementation and introduce EXTRHECH, an Open IE system for Spanish. We also compare its performance with that of REVERB (Fader et al., 2011) on a parallel dataset. Additionally, we evaluate performance of our system over a dataset of texts randomly extracted from the Internet and discuss the issues that arise when processing random Internet texts. We also give a brief analysis of errors. The paper is organized as follows. Related work is reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 presents our approach to Open IE for Spanish and describes the EXTRHECH system. Section 4 describes the experiments for a parallel English-Spanish dataset and for a Spanish dataset of texts randomly extracted from the Internet. In Section 5, a brief analysis of err</context>

The group of rule-based approaches includes systems based on rules applied over linguistically annotated texts. FES-2012 system (AguilarGalicia, 2012) applies rules to the fully parsed sentences. However, in the same work the authors show that this approach is too slow to be scaled to a Web-sized corpus and that it is not robust. Another system implementing rule-based approach is DEPOE (Gamallo et al., 2012). In this system, the rules are applied to the output of shallow dependency parsing. In REVERB system (Fader et al., 2011), syntactic constraints are applied over POS tags and syntactic chunks. The last two systems show better results in terms of precision/recall and speed, and, consequently, scalability to a Websized corpus. Finally, the approach based on the deep automatic linguistic analysis is implemented in OLLIE (Mausam et al., 2012). This system combines various approaches: it uses output of a rulebased Open IE system to bootstrap learning of the relation patterns and then additionally applies lexical and semantic patterns to extract relations that are not expessed through verb phrases.

DEPOE system, based on rules over shallow dependency parsing, is claimed 79 to have its variants for Spanish, Portuguese, and Galician languages (Gamallo et al., 2012). However, the authors do not report any experimental results on languages other than English or any language-specific details. The approach based on syntactic constraints over POS tags has not been applied to languages other than English, in spite of that this method can be easily adapted to other languages because it only requires a reliable POS tagger. The basic algorithm for relation extraction, according to Fader et al. (2011), is as follows: • First, search for a verb-containing relation phrase in a sentence; • If detected, search for a noun phrase to the left of the relation phrase; • If a noun phrase detected, search for another noun phrase to the right of the relation phrase. Additionally, the experiments for Open IE systems have been conducted only on texts that came from verified sources, i.e., Wikipedia, news, or textbooks (Banko and Etzioni, 2008; Fader et al., 2011; Mausam et al., 2012).

Thus, the input text needs an additional preprocessing stage to be converted into this encoding. Though this might look as a minor technical issue, guessing the original encoding becomes a significant problem when working with texts from arbitrary sources on the Web. We discuss encoding related issues in Section 4.2. After the text has been properly POS-tagged, we feed it into EXTRHECH system, which applies the fact extraction algorithm described in Section 2 to each sentence, one sentence at a time. We use the same basic algorithm as in (Fader et al., 2011) but with different triple matching rules as appropriate for Spanish grammar. The original POS-tag sequences for English would produce nonsense results on Spanish input due to substantial difference in grammars: infinitives are not preceded by “to”, adjectives usually follow nouns, and oblique case pronouns precede verbs instead of following them, just to name a few peculiarities of Spanish. First, the system looks for a verb-containing phrase in a sentence by matching it against the following expression: VREL —* (V W* P) |(V), where V stands either for a single verb optionally preceded by a r</context>

Third, relative clauses introduced by single relative pronouns (e.g., que (“that”, “who”), cual (“which”)) as in las partes que conforman un trabajo de investigaci´on (“parts that make up a research work”) are also searched for relations. However, relative pronoun phrases with prepositions, e.g. en el cual (“in which”) are not taken into consideration for relation extraction due to their coreferential complexity. 3.3 Limitations The implementation of basic processing performed by EXTRHECH system follows the algorithm introduced in (Fader et al., 2011). This means that extracted facts are limited to the relations expressed through a verb phrase. This limitation is discussed in the cited paper. In our apporach to Open IE in Spanish, we do not allow pronouns to be potential arguments of a relation. It was mainly done because of a wide use of a neutral pronoun lo (“this”, “which”, or no direct translation) as a head of relative clauses in Spanish language, e.g., lo que dio valor al poder judicial (“ that gave value to the judiciary”). Including pronouns for potential argument matches would return a lot of uninformative relations as (lo; dio va</context>

However, the occurence of this construction is less then 10% according to (Clements, 2006). 4 Experiments and Evaluation In this section we describe the experiments conducted with EXTRHECH system. 4.1 Experiment on parallel news dataset We compare EXTRHECH’s performance with that of REVERB, an Open IE system for English based on the same algorithm (Fader et al., 2011). Since these systems are designed for different languages, we ran our experiment on a parallel dataset.1 We took 300 parallel sentences from the English-Spanish part of News Commentary Corpus (Callison-Burch et al., 2011). Then, we ran the extractors over the corresponding languages. After that, two human annotators labeled each extraction as correct or incorrect. For the Spanish part of the dataset, the annotators agreed on 80% of extractions (Cohen’s kappa n = 0.60), whereas for the English part they agreed on 85% of extractions with n = 0.68. For both datasets their respective n coefficien</context>

Hence, the systems were in equivalent conditions. The results of the experiment are shown in Table 1. As we see, on a parallel dataset of texts from News Commentary Corpus, both systems show a very similar performance. Based on this observation, we can conclude that the algorithm suggested Precision Recall Correct Returned System Extractions Extractions EXTRHECH 0.59 0.48 218 368 REVERB 0.56 0.44 201 358 Table 1: Performance comparison of REVERB and EXTRHECH systems over a parallel dataset. in (Fader et al., 2011) can be easily adopted for other languages with dominating SVO word order and an available POS-tagger. 4.2 Experiment on Raw Web dataset One of the most important goals of Open IE systems is to be able to process large amounts of texts directly from the Web. This requires high performance speed and robustness on texts that often lack grammatical and orthographical correctness or coherence. The study showing the approach’s advantage in speed was already presented in (Fader et al., 2011). In this work we focused on robustness.

However, 41 from those 200 chunks were not samples of textual information in human language but rather pieces of programming codes or numbers. We took out these chunks because they are not relevant for our research. In a real life scenario they could be easily detected and eliminated from the Web data stream.

The ability to extract arbitrary relations from text allows applications of Open IE that are not possible in the frame of traditional IE. Among them are fact extraction at sentence level (e.g., (Mozart; was born in; Salzburg)), new perspective on search as question answering (e.g., Where was Mozart born?) (Etzioni, 2011), or assessment of the quality of text documents at Web scale (Horn et al., 2013). Additionally, the output of Open IE systems can serve for ontology population (Soderland et al., 2010) and acquisition of common sense knowledge (Lin et al., 2010). Although all Open IE systems are targeted at the extraction of arbitrary relations, the approaches to this task vary significantly. The pilot approach suggested by Banko et al. (2007) is based on semi-supervised learning of general relation patterns that then serve for extraction of arbitrary relations. However, the output of such systems contains many incoherent and inconsistent extractions, and the training stage is quite computationally complex. Fader et al. (2011) suggested another approach where syntactic and lexical constrain</context>

Chronologically the first one was introduced in the pilot works on Open IE by Banko et al. (2007) and Etzioni et al. (2008). Their approach is based on semi-supervised machine learning principles and includes three main steps: (1) manual labeling of a training corpus for seed relation phrases and features; (2) further semi-supervised learning of relations; (3) automatic extractions of relations and their arguments. This approach is implemented in TEXTRUNNER (Banko and Etzioni, 2008), WOEpos, and WOEparse, both (Wu and Weld, 2010). In these systems, the detection of a relation triple starts from the potential arguments expressed as noun phrases, i.e., before the connecting relation phrase is detected. Once detected, neither the argument phrases nor the relation phrase can be backtracked, which makes the approach prone to incoherent and uninformative extractions. For example, in “to make a deal with”, deal can be erroneously extracted as an argument, although it is a part of the relation phrase. The group of rule-based approaches includes systems based on rules applied over linguistically annotated texts. FES-2012 syste</context>

While most of the sentences were in UTF-8 encoding and were converted in a single pass, the encoding of about 3% of the sentences was initially corrupted, therefore, they were not processed correctly by the POS-tagger. Although the issue is manageable at the scale of a small dataset, it might affect the speed and quality of fact extraction when working at Web scale. 5 Error Analysis After running EXTRHECH on the datasets, we analyzied the errors in the output. We followed the classifications of the types of errors and their causes suggested in (Zhila and Gelbukh, 2014). The distribution of the errors in EXTRHECH’s output over the types of errors is shown in Table 3. The data about error types was gathered over extractions from Raw Web dataset. When errors are present both in the arguments and in the relation phrase, they are likely to have the same cause. Based on the analysis of the outputs over Raw Web dataset, the following causes for errors have been observed: • Underspecified noun phrase • Overspecified verb phrase • Non-contiguous verb phrase Type of errors Percentage Incorrect relation phrase 21% Incorrect argument(s) 45% of them, with also incorrect</context>

However, as it can be seen in Table 3, this is the least common type of errors, which is in accordance to the low frecuency of the inverse word order (Clements, 2006). A more detailed analysis of the issues that cause the errors can be found in (Zhila and Gelbukh, 2014). 6 Conclusions We have introduced an approach to Open IE based on syntactic constraints over POS tag sequences targeted at Spanish language. We described the rules for relation phrases and their arguments in Spanish and their implementation in EXTRHECH system. Further, we presented a series of experiments with EXTRHECH and showed (1) that the performance of this approach to Open IE is similar for English and Spanish, and (2) that EXTRHECH’s performance is robust on texts of varying quality. We also gave a brief classification of errors by their types and causes. Our future plans include imple</context>
