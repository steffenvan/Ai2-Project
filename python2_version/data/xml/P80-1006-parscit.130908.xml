Interactive Discourse: Influence of Problem Context

The purpose of the special parasession on &amp;quot;Interactive
Man/Machine Discourse&amp;quot; is to discuss some critical
issues in the design of (computer-based) interactive
natural language processing systems. This panel will
be addressing the question of how the purpose of the
interaction, or &amp;quot;problem context&amp;quot; affects what is said
and how it is interpreted. Each of the panel members
brings a different orientation toward the study of
language to this question. My hope is that looking at
the question from these different perspectives will ex-
pose issues critical to the study of language in gener-
al, and to the construction of computer systems that can
communicate with people in particular. Of course, the
issue of the influence of &amp;quot;problem context&amp;quot; is separable
from the issue of how one might get a computer system to
take into account the effects of this context (and, yes,
even whether that is possible). My hope is that those
on the panel who are concerned with the construction of
computer-based natural language processing systems will
address some of the issues of &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; and that all of the
panelists will consider the prior questions of what ef-
fects there are and what general principles underlie how
the &amp;quot;problem context&amp;quot; influences a dialogue.
There are two separate aspects to the &amp;quot;problem context&amp;quot;
that influence the participants&apos; expectations and hence
their utterances: (1) the function of the discourse,
and, (2) the domain of discourse.
Function: This aspect of the problem context concerns
h.y. the speaker and hearer are communicating and their
relative roles in the communication. Casual conversa-
tions, classroom discussions, task-oriented dialogues,
and stories have very different functions. Although it
is most reasonable to consider computer systems as par-
ticipating in a restricted kind of dialogue (namely, a
dialogue which arises from aiding a person in the solu-
tion of some problem), it is still clear that such sys-
tems may assume different roles, e.g., that of an expert
(user is an apprentice), tutor (student), or supplier of
information (e.g., from a large data base). Each of the
different functions results in different kinds of goals
(e.g., teaching requires a different kind of informing
than simple question answering) and each of the differ-
ent roles will create different expectations on the part
of the user and different needs in terms of the kinds of
information the system has about the user.
Domain: This aspect concerns what a speaker is talking
about, the subject matter of the discourse. The struc-
ture of the information being discussed has an effect on
the language (cf. Chafe&apos;s &amp;quot;The Flow of Language and the
Flow of Thought&amp;quot;, Linde&apos;s work on apartment descriptions
and planning, my work on focusing in task-oriented.dia-
logues).
Both of these aspects of &amp;quot;problem context&amp;quot; have global
effects on what gets discussed and in what &amp;quot;units&amp;quot;, and
local effects on how speakers express the information
they convey. Clearly the two aspects interact. For ex-
ample, what a speaker chooses to discuss next depends
both on why he is telling the hearer and on the informa-
tion itself and what it is related to.
Some questions to consider:
In what ways are the effects of problem context manifest
in individual utterances and larger discourse units?
How do people&apos;s &amp;quot;conversational styles&amp;quot; differ?
The above discussion of &amp;quot;function&amp;quot; gave several exam-
plea. There is no taxonomy of function (as I&apos;ve used
the word). How might such a taxonomy be constructed and
used?
What kinds of expectations are set up by different kinds
of functions?
What assumptions about the knowledge, beliefs, and goals
that are shared by the participants are made by the dif-
ferent functions?
How do the constraints from function interact with those
of domain?
What kinds of &amp;quot;tools&amp;quot; are useful for examining such is-
sues? (e.g., what kinds of analysis of data can be
done)?
What happens when expectations generated by problem con-
text (either function or domain) are violated?
