1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999675125">
In the last decade the practice of translating and
therefore also training of translators, like many
other features of our lives, have undergone a major
change. Is it a change for the better or for the
worse? To answer this question we have to
consider several aspects and characteristics of
present-day translation and translator training. The
title of this paper uses the attribute “technology-
enhanced”. I will explain what is meant by this
adjective and how indispensable technology has
become for translators nowadays. I will touch upon
problems of translating into L2 and the resources
and tools available for dealing with this sort of
translation. Finally, the personality of the teacher
of translation and his/her background will be
considered.

2 History and New Developments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906151515152">
Fifteen years ago, before the Velvet Revolution1,
a teacher of translation under the communist
regime was left to his/her own devices as to what
to do. The access to foreign language press and
broadcasts was limited due to political reasons,
rather than technical ones, and so were the copying
facilities. The authorities required registration of
all copied materials, trying to prevent the
inevitable – spreading of information on
“forbidden” topics.
Typing with a number of carbon papers to
produce enough copies for the class used to be
a standard procedure. Extracts from fiction, written
by dead or “approved” authors, were the most
easily accessible sources of language materials.
Magazines, journals and newspapers were difficult
to get hold of but much more popular with the
students. The same was true about any authentic
video material, TV recordings or films showing
life beyond the Iron Curtain, i.e. in the West. Using
news items in lessons sometimes meant risking a
clash with the official version of reports on public
radio and TV channels.
But after 1989 sweeping changes occurred.
Copiers, news broadcasts, newspapers and an
abundance of books in foreign languages became
reality – with more to come: computers and the
Internet. We have been flooded with information
and technologies. It did not happen overnight, and
all the technological paraphernalia are not easy or
cheap to get. However, they are here, they are
available and furthermore, we are expected to use
them efficiently.

<bodyText confidence="0.9485755">
For translators the advent of computers has meant
a revolutionary change. All the shelves of
reference materials, encyclopaedias and
dictionaries are now inside the computer and there

is much more in there (Harold, 2003). The
situation is now reversed: instead of the lack of
resources and technology, there is too much for a
person to be able to come to grips with. Translators
are required to be at the cutting edge of
technological endeavour. They are expected to be
linguistic geniuses and translate into and from their
mother tongue. “Mother tongue” is sometimes no
longer so easy to establish and is therefore called
the “language of habitual use”.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989634">
2.1.1 Training of Translators
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980829268293">
Training of translators, like translation itself, has
become computer-bound. No translator can do
without mastering the basics of text processing and
looking up information on the Internet. But this is
by no means all of it. Translator training should
make it possible for the students to use the
computer with ease and confidence. It should teach
them how to use all the necessary tools that are
supposed to make translation more efficient and
that, hopefully, also guarantee better quality of
translation.
Translation teachers have the option to use new
Learning Management Systems to provide direct
access to links on the Internet and familiarize the
students with the reality of working with electronic
texts in the virtual environment. For a comparison
of the various systems, use the link provided in the
footnote at the bottom of this page2.
However, as Anthony Pym explains in his paper
on E-Learning and Translator Training, we should
“work with people as well as technology, since the
people, not the tools, are the ones who are going to
solve your problems and achieve progress in
learning. This (...) point perhaps deserves special
emphasis. As translation itself becomes an
increasingly technical concern, much of our
teaching inevitably concerns techniques, skills,
tools, procedures, in fact anything except people.
An exclusive focus on the technicalities of e-
learning is likely to take us even further down that
road. And yet, when all is said and done, all our
communication is human-to-human, be it face-to-
face or across the planet. If the social principles of
learning communities and teaching teams can be
maintained and developed, there is no
overwhelming reason why technology should not
extend rather than restrict the humanity of our
task.” My experience has shown that
a combination of e-classes with traditional classes
taking place every week is very effective. That
explains the title of this article. I use technology to

teacher-student and student-student interaction in
the classroom.

3.1 Background on Open Source Software
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922038461538">
The following information is from the Corporate
University Enterprise (CUE) White Paper: “The
history of open source software is very closely
related to the history of the Internet itself. It can be
traced to post-Sputnik initiatives during the
Eisenhower administration. Because the
Eisenhower administration did not want to
concentrate technology research in the Pentagon,
money was provided to universities and new non-
military government entities such as NASA and
the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
These agencies and universities became heavily
involved in developing computing and
communications technologies.”
Like so much of the open source applications
that are available, the tools have been
conceptualised and created to fill a need in the
university setting. Learning management systems
in the university setting are focused on online
collaboration, often as a supplement to classroom
education. This was a major criterion for our
choosing Moodle (i.e. Modular Object-Oriented
Dynamic Learning Environment). Moodle is in
many ways a one-man campaign by the Australian
Martin Dougiamas. As he himself says: ‘Moodle is
my perpetual work in progress.’

Moodle3 is a course management system (CMS) -
a software package designed to help educators
create quality online courses. Such e-learning
systems are sometimes also called Learning
Management Systems (LMS) or Virtual Learning
Environments (VLE). One of the main advantages
of Moodle over other systems is a strong
grounding in social constructionist pedagogy. This
means that the role of the teacher changes – he or
she is no longer the only source of knowledge but
more of a mediator of information and moderator
of discussions.
Moodle is Open Source4 software, which
means that you are free to download it, use it,
modify it and even distribute it under the terms of
the General Public License (GNU)5. Moodle runs
without modification on Unix, Linux, Windows,

</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999752">
3.2 How does it work?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978338983051">
Once Moodle has been installed on the server,
the teacher has a chance to develop an electronic
course totally independently of the technician. It is
true that problems resulting from the very nature of
computer technology do occur, but apart from
these, teachers can work on their own and use all
the creativity and resources they desire. The
teaching takes place in a classroom equipped with
a data projector and a screen and has access to the
Internet. Students are asked to print out their
version after submitting them and bring the hard
copy to class. It is necessary to have something to
fall back upon when there is a technical problem
and the data projector in the classroom does not
work or if there is another technical problem and
no assignments can be displayed on the screen.
First of all there is the option to choose
between a weekly format, a topics format or even
the social format. The weekly and topics formats
are very similar in structure. The main difference is
that each box in the weekly format covers exactly
one week and has the date, whereas in the topics
format each box can cover whatever you like. The
social format doesn&apos;t use much content at all and is
based around just one forum - this is displayed on
the main page (hence it is not suitable for our
purposes).
In a practical translation class each topic can
be devoted to a different type of text (letters –
business and personal, articles, contracts etc.). The
teacher can include resources for the study of the
topic by uploading files. See the description under
Resources.
Creating a course involves adding course
activity modules to the main page in the order that
students will be using them. They can be shuffled
any time. To turn on editing, the toggle switch
&amp;quot;Turn on editing&amp;quot; under Administration must be
on. It shows or hides the extra controls necessary
to manipulate the main course page. To add a new
activity, the type of activity is selected from a pop-
up menu. After adding activities the teacher can
move them up and down in the course layout by
clicking on arrow icons next to each one. They can
also be deleted by using the cross icon, and re-
edited by using the edit icon.
Within each topic or week the teacher can use
an array of course activities: forums – to present
students’ contributions and stimulate discussion,
journals to make the students describe the
procedure when fulfilling a more complex or
difficult task, or quizzes to test the students’
progress in mastering the basics of translation
theory (a multiple-choice or true-false test) or the
pitfalls of interference (translating sentences from
the mother tongue – short-answers test). The
questions are kept in a categorised database, and
can be re-used within courses and even between
courses. Quizzes can allow multiple attempts. Each
attempt is automatically marked, and the teacher
can choose whether to give feedback or to show
correct answers or both. All answers can be
evaluated later and more options can be added to
the “correct answers”.
Resources are the content of the course.
Teachers may have existing content that they want
to add to the course, such as web pages, audio
files, video files (e.g. tutorials), Word documents,
flash animations or even TM-tool files (.pxf and
.txf). Any type of file that exists can be uploaded
into the course and stored on the server. While the
files are on the server they can be moved, renamed,
edited or deleted. Updating materials is therefore
very easy and can be done fairly quickly.
An assignment is usually set with a due date and
a maximum grade. Students are able to upload one
file. The date they upload their file is recorded.
Afterwards, there is a single page on which each
file (and how late or early it is) can be viewed,
including the date and feedback. Half an hour after
the teacher grades any particular student, Moodle
will automatically email that student a notification.
If the teacher corrects the student’s assignment
using “track changes” in Word, the student can
then access the corrections in a feedback file that
is uploaded in Moodle. This feature was added by
our administrator at the teachers’ request and was
named echo-assignment.
Before the actual class takes place class
members can view all the echo-assignments. After
the deadline for submitting the assignment has
expired, students can read their peers’ translations
and prepare for the discussion based on their
translations.
It is also possible for the student, if the
teacher allows it, to re-submit assignments after
the class, making the necessary changes or
improvements.
The teacher can use the Logs link (under
Administration) to get access to complete, raw
logs. The teacher will see a link to a pop-up
window that updates every sixty seconds and
shows the last hour of activity. Activity Reports
(next to each name in the list of all people, or from
any user profile page) provide the teacher with
a comprehensive overview of what any particular
person has been up to in the course.
According to the CUE report, features are the
main strength of Moodle. The features listed above
are only a sample. Language support is another
strength. Currently, Moodle is available in 34
languages6, with more under development. The
Czech version is currently being prepared at our
department. Moodle is the only open source LMS
to truly address the issue of human resource
information systems (HRIS) integration. The latest
release has a graphical user interface (GUI) tool to
hook into various external database formats.

language phenomena that represent borderline cases in
translation and cannot therefore be dealt with by means of
translation proper. These instances should lead us to some
general observations about systemic differences between
languages and cultures, as well as about translation.
We shall concentrate on short isolated texts (e.g. public
signboards and announcements, advertisement texts), short
literary texts strongly dependant on language (anecdote,
limerick...) or some specific forms that hardly meet the
standards of textuality (crossword puzzles, secret codes). The
students will be asked to (a) translate/transfer these texts into
Czech, (b) collect and compare original texts in both
languages, (c) define systemic differences between the two
languages and cultures and rules for handling these instances,
both from literature and from their own experience.

As mentioned earlier, translators are frequently
asked to translate into L2, rather than into their
mother tongue. This can bring about problems
even for very competent non-native users of the
target language (TL). Educated native speakers not
being available all the time, the translator is left
with a choice: either to refuse the job or to learn
about ways of coping with this challenge.
The use of electronic corpora, monolingual and
both parallel and comparable, together with the
relevant corpus managers or Internet search
engines can provide considerable help. In their
book Working with Specialized Language,
A practical guide to using corpora, Lynne Bowker
and Jennifer Pearson explain in detail how LSP
corpora can be used as a translation resource.
Students can follow their explanations and create
small ad hoc corpora to investigate usage, style
the importance of competence in the target language will be
stressed and a short test in Czech will inform the students of
the level of their Czech. The core of the course consists of the
translation of various types of texts and the discussion of
different translation procedures and techniques. The
theoretical basis will be supplied. Literature: J. Levý, Umění

11 Simona Mazacova : Translating humour can be an
extremely rewarding, yet at the same time an extremely
difficult task, as humour is more easily recognised than
analysed or reproduced. This seminar is going to examine
humour as a specific category which is closely tied not only to
language, but also to culture, mentality and historical context;
look at different types of humour and perhaps attempt a small
“cross-cultural study” on the differences between Czech and
Anglo-Saxon humour. Above all, however, we will try to
TRANSLATE humour and for this purpose the seminar will
employ not only literary texts but also jokes, cartoons, adverts,
drama, films or TV programmes. There will also be some
space for the students to contribute their own favourite
humorous texts.

and search for explanatory contexts in dealing with
terminology. Here are some key points they give:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998749666666667">
• “A corpus can provide you with both
linguistic and conceptual information.
• You can consult a parallel corpus in
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99916975">
much the same way as you consult a
bilingual dictionary, but a corpus will
provide more collocational and stylistic
information than a dictionary.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9978304">
• A monolingual corpus can also be used
as a translation resource, but you have to
be more creative in devising strategies to
find equivalents.
• You can also use monolingual corpora to

<bodyText confidence="0.999635918918919">
help you choose between synonyms,
identify usage information and
determine what style is appropriate for
your translation.”
Although more time is devoted to translations into
Czech, students also translate into English and get
acquainted with the above-mentioned techniques.
They are assigned tasks in terminology extraction
and management. To work on these projects they
used MultiTrans12 and Bonito13.
Bonito is a corpus manager developed by
Pavel Rychly of the Faculty of Informatics,
Masaryk University in Brno. The students have
been using Bonito to search corpora, including a
Czech-English parallel Corpus that was developed
at the Faculty of Arts14.
Another part of the training in “Becoming a
Translator” was to simulate a translation agency.
The students were asked to work with the free
Personal Edition (PE) version of Transit15 to
translate a text into English. I used Transit
Professional and Term Star to prepare translation
projects for them. These projects (.pxf format)
were based on revised translations and included
reference material for concordance searches and
also the required terminology. The students
uploaded their translations in .txf format in
Moodle.
Apart from language skills and mastering
new technologies, working as a translator also
involves dealing with clients, agencies, employers;
networking, research, use of technology; and
generally an awareness of the roles translation
plays in society and society plays in translation
(Robinson, 1997). Students were therefore exposed
to real-life situations and met experienced
translators who told them about their work. They

also followed discussions on the Internet on
various lists for translators and attended lectures,
directly or on-line. Recently Power-Point
presentations of such lectures have been uploaded
in Moodle.
It follows from what has been said that
translation teachers should be educated as
translators and teachers as well. This background
should make it possible for them to pass on the
knowledge and skills they have acquired. It helps if
the translation teacher is an IT expert as well. To
mention some personal qualities – I believe that
teachers in general, but translation teachers in
particular, should be open to discussion, definitely
not dogmatic, and willing to learn all their lives.
On the other hand, patience and pedantry, up to a
certain degree, is a must to be able to instil basic
rules and responsibilities of the profession in the
students.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992055555555">
The aim of this paper was to provide information
on courses in translation theory and practice, based
on current teaching experience, using the course
management system called Moodle.
I think that the instruction has changed for the
better due to the new technologies. Other questions
spring to mind – how is it possible that the quality
of translations is not getting better, too? Is there a
limit to what can be learned? We will have to wait
and see to be able to make a statement about that.
In conclusion I would like to say that creating
web-based materials and using authentic materials
is an exciting and rewarding activity but also a
never-ending adventure likely to “swallow” most
of the teachers’ leisure time. There is some hope,
however, that once this groundbreaking work has
been done, more time can be devoted to improving
the courses and making them work without a hitch.
