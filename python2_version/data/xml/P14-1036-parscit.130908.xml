<bodyText confidence="0.999908592592593">
Wikification for tweets aims to automat-
ically identify each concept mention in a
tweet and link it to a concept referent in
a knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia). Due
to the shortness of a tweet, a collective
inference model incorporating global ev-
idence from multiple mentions and con-
cepts is more appropriate than a non-
collecitve approach which links each men-
tion at a time. In addition, it is chal-
lenging to generate sufficient high quality
labeled data for supervised models with
low cost. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a novel semi-supervised graph
regularization model to incorporate both
local and global evidence from multi-
ple tweets through three fine-grained re-
lations. In order to identify semantically-
related mentions for collective inference,
we detect meta path-based semantic rela-
tions through social networks. Compared
to the state-of-the-art supervised model
trained from 100% labeled data, our pro-
posed approach achieves comparable per-
formance with 31% labeled data and ob-
tains 5% absolute F1 gain with 50% la-
beled data.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900978723405">
With millions of tweets posted daily, Twitter en-
ables both individuals and organizations to dis-
seminate information, from current affairs to
breaking news in a timely fashion. In this
work, we study the wikification (Disambiguation
to Wikipedia) task (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007)
for tweets, which aims to automatically identify
each concept mention in a tweet, and link it to a
concept referent in a knowledge base (KB) (e.g.,
Wikipedia). For example, as shown in Figure 1,
Hawks is an identified mention, and its correct ref-
erent concept in Wikipedia is Atlanta Hawks. An
end-to-end wikification system needs to solve two
sub-problems: (i) concept mention detection, (ii)
concept mention disambiguation.
Wikification is a particularly useful task for
short messages such as tweets because it allows
a reader to easily grasp the related topics and en-
riched information from the KB. From a system-
to-system perspective, wikification has demon-
strated its usefulness in a variety of applica-
tions, including coreference resolution (Ratinov
and Roth, 2012) and classification (Vitale et al.,
2012).
Sufficient labeled data is crucial for supervised
models. However, manual wikification annota-
tion for short documents is challenging and time-
consuming (Cassidy et al., 2012). The challenges
are: (i) unlinkability, a valid concept may not ex-
ist in the KB. (ii) ambiguity, it is impossible to
determine the correct concept due to the dearth
of information within a single tweet or multiple
correct answer. For instance, it would be diffi-
cult to determine the correct referent concept for
“Gators” in t1 in Figure 1. Linking “UCONN”
in t3 to University of Connecticut may also be ac-
ceptable since Connecticut Huskies is the athletic
team of the university. (iii) prominence, it is chal-
lenging to select a set of linkable mentions that
are important and relevant. It is not tricky to select
“Fans”, “slump”, and “Hawks” as linkable men-
tions, but other mentions such as “stay up” and
“stay positive” are not prominent. Therefore, it
is challenging to create sufficient high quality la-
beled tweets for supervised models and worth con-
sidering semi-supervised learning with the explo-
ration of unlabeled data.

However, when selecting semi-supervised
learning frameworks, we noticed another unique
challenge that tweets pose to wikification due
to their informal writing style, shortness and
noisiness. The context of a single tweet usually
cannot provide enough information for prominent
mention detection and similarity computing for
disambiguation. Therefore, a collective inference
model over multiple tweets in the semi-supervised
setting is desirable. For instance, the four tweets
in Figure 1 are posted by the same author within
a short time period. If we perform collective
inference over them we can reliably link am-
biguous mentions such as “Gators”, “Hawks”,
and “Bucks” to basketball teams instead of other
concepts such as the county Bucks County.
In order to address these unique challenges
for wikification for the short tweets, we employ
graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms
(Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Blum
et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and
Crammer, 2009) for collective inference by ex-
ploiting the manifold (cluster) structure in both
unlabeled and labeled data. These approaches
normally assume label smoothness over a defined
graph, where the nodes represent a set of labeled
and unlabeled instances, and the weighted edges
reflect the closeness of each pair of instances. In
order to construct a semantic-rich graph capturing
the similarity between mentions and concepts for
the model, we introduce three novel fine-grained
relations based on a set of local features, social
networks and meta paths.
The main contributions of this paper are sum-
marized as follows:

2 Preliminaries
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998830608695652">
Concept and Concept Mention We define a con-
cept c as a Wikipedia article (e.g., Atlanta Hawks),
and a concept mention m as an n-gram from a spe-
cific tweet. Each concept has a set of textual repre-
sentation fields (Meij et al., 2012), including title
(the title of the article), sentence (the first sentence
of the article), paragraph (the first paragraph of
the article), content (the entire content of the arti-
cle), and anchor (the set of all anchor texts with
incoming links to the article).
Wikipedia Lexicon Construction We first
construct an offline lexicon with each entry as
(m, {ci, ..., ck}�, where {ci, ..., ck} is the set of
possible referent concepts for the mention m.
Following the previous work (Bunescu, 2006;
Cucerzan, 2007; Hachey et al., 2013), we extract
the possible mentions for a given concept c using
the following resources: the title of c; the aliases
appearing in the introduction and infoboxes of c
(e.g., The Evergreen State is an alias of Wash-
ington state); the titles of pages redirecting to c
(e.g., State of Washington is a redirecting page of
Washington (state)); the titles of the disambigua-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999655761904762">
tion pages containing c; and all the anchor texts
appearing in at least 5 pages with hyperlinks to c
(e.g., WA is a mention for the concept Washing-
ton (state) in the text “401 5th Ave N [[Seattle]],
[[Washington (state)—WA]] 98109 USA”. We also
propose three heuristic rules to extract mentions
(i.e., different combinations of the family name
and given name for a person, the headquarters of
an organization, and the city name for a sports
team).
Concept Mention Extraction Based on the
constructed lexicon, we then consider all n-grams
of size ≤ n (n=7 in this paper) as concept mention
candidates if their entries in the lexicon are not
empty. We first segment @usernames and #hash-
tags into regular tokens (e.g., @amandapalmer is
segmented as amanda palmer and #WorldWater-
Day is split as World Water Day) using the ap-
proach proposed by (Wang et al., 2011). Segmen-
tation assists finding concept candidates for these
non-regular mentions.

3.1 Principles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981027419354839">
A single tweet may not provide enough evidence
to identify prominent mentions and infer their cor-
rect referent concepts due to the lack of contextual
information. To tackle this problem, we propose to
incorporate global evidence from multiple tweets
and performing collective inference for both men-
tion identification and disambiguation. We first in-
troduce the following three principles that our ap-
proach relies on.
Principle 1 (Local compatibility): Two pairs
of (m, c) with strong local compatibility tend to
have similar labels. Mentions and their correct
referent concepts usually tend to share a set of
characteristics such as string similarity between m
and c (e.g., (Chicago, Chicago) and (Facebook,
Facebook)). We define the local compatibility to
model such set of characteristics.
Principle 2 (Coreference): Two coreferential
mentions should be linked to the same concept.
For example, if we know “nc” and “North Car-
olina” are coreferential, then they should both be
linked to North Carolina.
Principle 3 (Semantic Relatedness): Two
highly semantically-related mentions are more
likely to be linked to two highly semantically-
related concepts. For instance, when “Sweet 16”
and “Hawks” often appear together within rel-
evant contexts, they can be reliably linked to
two baseketball-related concepts NCAA Men’s Di-
vision I Basketball Championship and Atlanta
Hawks, respectively.

3.2 Approach Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981333333333">
Given a set of tweets (ti, ..., tITI), our system first
generates a set of candidate concept mentions, and
then extracts a set of candidate concept referents
for each mention based on the Wikipedia lexicon.
Given a pair of mention and its candidate referent
concept (m, c), the remaining task of wikification
is to assign either a positive label if m should be
selected as a prominently linkable mention and c
is its correct referent concept, or otherwise a neg-
ative label. The label assignment is obtained by
our semi-supervised graph regularization frame-
work based on a relational graph, which is con-
structed from local compatibility, coreference, and
semantic relatedness relations. The overview of
our approach is as illustrated in Figure 2.

We first construct the relational graph G = (V, E),
where V = {vi, ..., vn} is a set of nodes and E =

concept candidate ci. An edge is added between
two nodes vi and vj if there is a proposed rela-
tion based on the three principles described in sec-

of features which are similar to those commonly
used in wikification and entity linking work (Meij

Context Features This set of features include
(i) Context Capitalization features, which indicate
whether the current mention, the token before, and
the token after are capitalized. (ii) tf-idf based fea-
tures, which include the dot product of two word
vectors vc and vt, and the average tf-idf value of
common items in vc and vt, where vc and vt are
the top 100 tf-idf word vectors in c and t.
Local Compatibility Computation For each
node vi = (mi, ci), we collect its local features
as a feature vector Fi = (f1, f2,..., fd). To avoid
features with large numerical values that domi-
nate other features, the value of each feature is
re-scaled using feature standardization approach.
The cosine similarity is then adopted to compute
the local compatibility of two nodes and construct
a k nearest neighbor (kNN) graph, where each
node is connected to its k nearest neighboring
nodes. We compute the weight matrix that rep-
resents the local compatibility relation as:

<figureCaption confidence="0.993264">
Figure 3: Schema of the Twitter network.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999824">
In this subsection, we introduce the concept
meta path which will be used to detect corefer-
ence (section 4.3) and semantic relatedness rela-
tions (section 4.4).
A meta-path is a path defined over a network
and composed of a sequence of relations between
different object types (Sun et al., 2011b). In our
experimental setting, we can construct a natu-
ral Twitter network summarized by the network
schema in Figure 3. The network contains four
types of objects: Mention (M), Tweet (T), User
(U), and Hashtag (H). Tweets and mentions are
connected by links “contain” and “contained by”
(denoted as “contain−1”); and other linked rela-
tionships can be described similarly.
We then define the following five types of meta
paths to connect two mentions as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999909">
• “M - T - M”,
• “M - T - U - T - M”,
• “M - T - H - T - M”,
• “M - T - U - T - M - T - H - T - M”,
• “M - T - H - T - M - T - U - T - M”.

Each meta path represents one particular seman-
tic relation. For instance, the first three paths are
basic ones expressing the explicit relations that
two mentions are from the same tweet, posted by
the same user, and share the same #hashtag, re-
spectively. The last two paths are concatenated
ones which are constructed by concatenating the
first three simple paths to express the implicit rela-
tions that two mentions co-occur with a third men-
tion sharing either the same authorship or #hash-
tag. Such complicated paths can be exploited to
detect more semantically-related mentions from
wider contexts. For example, the relational link
between “narita airport” and “Japan” would be
missed without using the path “narita airport - t1
- u1 - t2 - american - t3 - h1 - t4 - Japan” since they
don’t directly share any authorships or #hashtags.

4.3 Coreference
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950272727273">
A coreference relation (Principle 2) usually occurs
across multiple tweets due to the highly redundant
information in Twitter. To ensure high precision,
we propose a simple yet effective approach utiliz-
ing the rich social network relations in Twitter.
We consider two mentions mi and mj corefer-
ential if mi and mj share the same surface form
or one is an abbreviation of the other, and at least
one meta path exists between mi and mj. Then we
define the weight matrix representing the corefer-
ential relation as:

4.4 Semantic Relatedness
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956125">
Ensuring topical coherence (Principle 3) has been
beneficial for wikification on formal texts (e.g.,
News) by linking a set of semantically-related
mentions to a set of semantically-related concepts
simultaneously (Han et al., 2011; Ratinov et al.,
2011; Cheng and Roth, 2013). However, the short-
ness of a single tweet means that it may not pro-
vide enough topical clues. Therefore, it is impor-
tant to extend this evidence to capture semantic re-
latedness information from multiple tweets.
We define the semantic relatedness score be-
tween two mentions as SR(mi, mj) = 1.0 if at
least one meta path exists between mi and mj,
otherwise SR(mi, mj) = 0. In order to compute
the semantic relatedness of two concepts ci and
cj, we adopt the approach proposed by (Milne and
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.992780666666667">
Witten, 2008a):
log max(|Ci|, |Cj|) − log |Ci ∩ Cj|

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998006">
where |C |is the total number of concepts in
Wikipedia, and Ci and Cj are the set of concepts
that have links to ci and cj, respectively.
Then we compute a weight matrix representing
the semantic relatedness relation as:

to the space limitations.
Based on the above three weight matrices Wloc,
Wcoref, and Wrel, we first obtain their corre-
sponding transition matrices Ploc, Pcoref, and

novel graph representation has two advantages: (i)
It can easily incorporate more features related to
both mentions and concepts. (ii) It is more appro-

Given the constructed relational graph with the
weighted matrix W and the label vector Y of all
nodes, we assume the first l nodes are labeled as
Yl and the remaining u nodes (u = n − l) are ini-
tialized with labels Yu0. Then our goal is to refine
Yu0 and obtain the final label vector Yu.
Intuitively, if two nodes are strongly connected,
they tend to hold the same label. We propose a
novel semi-supervised graph regularization frame-
work based on the graph-based semi-supervised
learning algorithm (Zhu et al., 2003):

The first term is a loss function that incorporates
the initial labels of unlabeled examples into the
model. In our method, we adopt prior popular-
ity (section 4.1) to initialize the labels of the un-
labeled examples. The second term is a regular-
izer that smoothes the refined labels over the con-
structed graph. µ is a regularization parameter that
controls the trade-off between initial labels and the
consistency of labels on the graph. The goal of the
proposed framework is to ensure that the refined
labels of unlabeled nodes are consistent with their
strongly connected nodes, as well as not too far
away from their initial labels.
The above optimization problem can be solved
directly since 2(Y) is convex (Zhu et al., 2003;
Zhou et al., 2004). Let I be an identity matrix
and DW be a diagonal matrix with entries Dii =
E j Wij. We can split the weighted matrix W into
four blocks as W = Wll Wlu, where Wmn is
~Wul Wuu~
an mxn matrix. Dw is split similarly. We assume
that the vector of the labeled examples Yl is fixed,
so we only need to infer the refined label vector of
the unlabeled examples Yu. In order to minimize
2(Y), we need to find Yu∗ such that

<equation confidence="0.948165">

WulYl − µYu0 = 0.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999882">
Therefore, a closed form solution can be derived
as Yu∗ = (Duu + µIuu − Wuu)−1(WulYl + µYu0).
However, for practical application to a large-
scale data set, an iterative solution would be more
efficient to solve the optimization problem. Let
Yut be the refined labels after the tth iteration, the
iterative solution can be derived as:

Y t+1 = (Duu+µIuu)−1(WuuY t u+WulYl+µYu 0 ).

The iterative solution is more efficient since
(Duu + µIuu) is a diagonal matrix and its inverse
is very easy to compute.

6.1 Data and Scoring Metric
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978944444444">
For our experiments we use a public data set (Meij
et al., 2012) including 502 tweets posted by 28
verified users. The data set was annotated by two
annotators. We randomly sample 102 tweets for
development and the remaining for evaluation. We
use a Wikipedia dump on May 3, 2013 as our
knowledge base, which includes 30 million pages.
For computational efficiency, we also filter some
mention candidates by applying the preprocess-
ing approach proposed in (Ferragina and Scaiella,
2010), and remove all the concepts with prior pop-
ularity less than 2% from an mention’s concept set
for each mention, similar to (Guo et al., 2013).
A mention and concept pair (m, c) is judged as
correct if and only if m is linkable and c is the
correct referent concept for m. To evaluate the
performance of a wikification system, we use the
standard precision, recall and F1 measures.

Methods Descriptions
TagMe The same approach that is described in (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010), which aims to annotate short
texts based on prior popularity and semantic relatedness of concepts. It is basically an unsupervised
approach, except that it needs a development set to tune the probability threshold for linkable mentions.
Meij A state-of-the-art system described in (Meij et al., 2012), which is a supervised approach based on the
random forest model. It performs mention detection and disambiguation jointly, and it is trained from
400 labeled tweets.
SSRegu1 Our proposed model based on Principle 1, using 200 labeled tweets.
SSRegu12 Our proposed model based on Principle 1 and 2, using 200 labeled tweets.
SSRegu13 Our proposed model based on Principle 1 and 3, using 200 labeled tweets.
SSRegu123 Our proposed full model based on Principle 1, 2 and 3, using 200 labeled tweets.

tions of values from 0 to 1 at 0.1 intervals1. In
order to randomize the experiments and make the
comparison fair, we conduct 20 test runs for each
method and report the average scores across the 20
trials.
The relatively low performance of the baseline
system TagMe demonstrates that only relying on
prior popularity and topical information within a
single tweet is not enough for an end-to-end wik-
ification system for the short tweets. As an exam-
ple, it is difficult to obtain topical clues in order
to link the mention “Clinton” to Hillary Rodham
Clinton by relying on the single tweet “wolfblitzer-
cnn: Behind the scenes on Clinton’s Mideast trip
#cnn”. Therefore, the system mistakenly links it
to the most popular concept Bill Clinton.
In comparision with the supervised baseline
proposed by (Meij et al., 2012), our model
SSRegu1 relying on local compatibility already
achieves comparable performance with 50% of
labeled data. This is because that our model
performs collective inference by making use of
the manifold (cluster) structure of both labeled
and unlabeled data, and that the local compat-
ibility relation is detected with high precision2
(89.4%). For example, the following three pairs
of mentions and concepts (pelosi, Nancy Pelosi),
(obama, Barack Obama), and (gaddafi, Muam-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9912742">

ent training data, a sample of them is: α = 0.4, β = 0.5, and
γ = 0.1

mar Gaddafi) have strong local compatibility with
each other since they share many similar char-
acteristics captured by the local features such as
string similarity between the mention and the con-
cept. Suppose the first pair is labeled, then its pos-
itive label will be propagated to other unlabeled
nodes through the local compatibility relation, and
correctly predict the labels of other nodes.
Incorporating coreferential or semantic related-
ness relation into SSRegu1 provides further gains,
demonstrating the effectiveness of these two re-
lations. For instance, “wh” is correctly linked to
White House by incorporating evidence from its
coreferential mention “white house”. The corefer-
ential relation (Principle 2) is demonstrated to be
more beneficial than the semantic relatedness re-
lation (Principle 3) because the former is detected
with much higher precision (99.7%) than the latter
(65.4%).
Our full model SSRegu123 achieves significant
improvement over the supervised baseline (5% ab-
solute F1 gain with 95.0% confidence level by
the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test),
showing that incorporating global evidence from
multiple tweets with fine-grained relations is ben-
eficial. For instance, the supervised baseline fails
to link “UCONN” and “Bucks” in our examples
to Connecticut Huskies and Milwaukee Bucks, re-
spectively. Our full model corrects these two
wrong links by propagating evidence through the
semantic links as shown in Figure 4 to obtain mu-
tual ranking improvement. The best performance
of our full model also illustrates that the three re-
lations complement each other.
We also study the disambiguation performance
for the annotated mentions, as shown in Table 3.
We can easily see that our proposed approach
using 50% labeled data achieves similar perfor-
mance with the state-of-the-art supervised model
with 100% labeled data. When the mentions are
given, the unpervised approach TagMe has already

6.3 Effect of Concatenated Meta Paths
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999665">
In this work, we propose a unified framework uti-
lizing meta path-based semantic relations to ex-
plore richer relevant context. Beyond the basic
meta paths, we introduce concatenated ones by
concatenating the basic ones. The performance of
the system without using the concatenated meta
paths is shown in Table 4. In comparison with
the system based on all defined meta paths, we
can clearly see that the systems using concate-
nated ones outperform those relying on the sim-
ple ones. This is because the concatenated meta
paths can incorporate more relevant information
with implicit relations into the models by increas-
ing 1.6% coreference links and 9.3% semantic re-
latedness links. For example, the mention “narita
airport” is correctly disambiguated to the concept
“Narita International Airport” with higher confi-
dence since its semantic relatedness relation with
“Japan” is detected with the concatenated meta
path as described in section 4.2.

In this subsection, we study the effect of labeled
data size on our full model. We randomly sam-

lect 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 tweets as
labeled data. 20 test runs are conducted and the
average results are reported across the 20 trials,
as shown in Figure 5. We find that as the size
of the labeled data increases, our proposed model
achieves better performance. It is encouraging to
see that our approach, with only 31.3% labeled
tweets (125 out of 400), already achieves a perfor-
mance that is comparable to the state-of-the-art su-
pervised model trained from 100% labeled tweets.

In previous experiments, we empirically set the
parameter p = 0.1. p is the regularization pa-

labels and the consistency of labels on the graph.
When p increases, the model tends to trust more in
the initial labels. Figure 6 shows the performance
of our models by varying p from 0.02 to 50. We
can easily see that the system performce is stable
when p &lt; 0.4. However, when p ≥ 0.4, the sys-
tem performance dramatically decreases, showing
that prior popularity is not enough for an end-to-
end wikification system.

A significant portion of recent work considers
the two sub-problems mention detection and men-
tion disambiguation separately and focus on the
latter by first defining candidate concepts for a
deemed mention based on anchor links. Men-
tion disambiguation is then formulated as a rank-
ing problem, either by resolving one mention at
each time (non-collective approaches), or by dis-
ambiguating a set of relevant mentions simulta-
neously (collective approaches). Non-collective
methods usually rely on prior popularity and con-
text similarity with supervised models (Mihalcea
and Csomai, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008b; Han
and Sun, 2011), while collective approaches fur-
ther leverage the global coherence between con-
cepts normally through supervised or graph-based
re-ranking models (Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and
Witten, 2008b; Han and Zhao, 2009; Kulkarni et
al., 2009; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2009; Ferrag-
ina and Scaiella, 2010; Fernandez et al., 2010;
Radford et al., 2010; Cucerzan, 2011; Guo et al.,
2011; Han and Sun, 2011; Han et al., 2011; Rati-
nov et al., 2011; Chen and Ji, 2011; Kozareva et
al., 2011; Cassidy et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2013;
Liu et al., 2013). Especially note that when apply-
ing the collective methods to short messages from
social media, evidence from other messages usu-
ally needs to be considered (Cassidy et al., 2012;
Shen et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013). Our method
is a collective approach with the following novel
advancements: (i) A novel graph representation
with fine-grained relations, (ii) A unified frame-
work based on meta paths to explore richer rele-
vant context, (iii) Joint identification and linking
of mentions under semi-supervised setting.
Two most similar methods to ours were pro-
posed by (Meij et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2013)
by performing joint detection and disambiguation
of mentions. (Meij et al., 2012) studied several
supervised machine learning models, but without
considering any global evidence either from a sin-
gle tweet or other relevant tweets. (Guo et al.,
2013) explored second order entity-to-entity rela-
tions but did not incorporate evidence from multi-
ple tweets.
This work is also related to graph-based semi-
supervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola
and Kondor, 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar
and Crammer, 2009), which has been success-
fully applied in many Natural Language Process-
ing tasks (Niu et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006).
We introduce a novel graph that incorporates three
fine-grained relations. Our work is further re-
lated to meta path-based heterogeneous informa-
tion network analysis (Sun et al., 2011b; Sun et
al., 2011a; Kong et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2013),
which has demonstrated advantages over homoge-
neous information network analysis without dif-
ferentiating object types and relational links.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999396">
We have introduced a novel semi-supervised graph
regularization framework for wikification to si-
multaneously tackle the unique challenges of an-
notation and information shortage in short tweets.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
to explore the semi-supervised collective inference
model to jointly perform mention detection and
disambiguation. By studying three novel fine-
grained relations, detecting semantically-related
information with semantic meta paths, and ex-
ploiting the data manifolds in both unlabeled and
labeled data for collective inference, our work can
dramatically save annotation cost and achieve bet-
ter performance, thus shed light on the challenging
wikification task for tweets.

<abstract confidence="0.998290214285715">Wikification for tweets aims to automatically identify each concept mention in a tweet and link it to a concept referent in a knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia). Due to the shortness of a tweet, a collective inference model incorporating global evidence from multiple mentions and concepts is more appropriate than a noncollecitve approach which links each mention at a time. In addition, it is challenging to generate sufficient high quality labeled data for supervised models with low cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised graph regularization model to incorporate both local and global evidence from multiple tweets through three fine-grained relations. In order to identify semanticallyrelated mentions for collective inference, we detect meta path-based semantic relations through social networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art supervised model trained from 100% labeled data, our proposed approach achieves comparable performance with 31% labeled data and obtains 5% absolute F1 gain with 50% labeled data.</abstract>

Therefore, a collective inference model over multiple tweets in the semi-supervised setting is desirable. For instance, the four tweets in Figure 1 are posted by the same author within a short time period. If we perform collective inference over them we can reliably link ambiguous mentions such as “Gators”, “Hawks”, and “Bucks” to basketball teams instead of other concepts such as the county Bucks County. In order to address these unique challenges for wikification for the short tweets, we employ graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Blum et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) for collective inference by exploiting the manifold (cluster) structure in both unlabeled and labeled data. These approaches normally assume label smoothness over a defined graph, where the nodes represent a set of labeled and unlabeled instances, and the weighted edges reflect the closeness of each pair of instances. In order to construct a semantic-rich graph capturing the similarity between mentions and concepts for the model, we introduce three novel fine-grained relations based on a set of local features, social networks and meta paths.

Wikification is a particularly useful task for short messages such as tweets because it allows a reader to easily grasp the related topics and enriched information from the KB. From a systemto-system perspective, wikification has demonstrated its usefulness in a variety of applications, including coreference resolution (Ratinov and Roth, 2012) and classification (Vitale et al., 2012). Sufficient labeled data is crucial for supervised models. However, manual wikification annotation for short documents is challenging and timeconsuming (Cassidy et al., 2012). The challenges are: (i) unlinkability, a valid concept may not exist in the KB. (ii) ambiguity, it is impossible to determine the correct concept due to the dearth of information within a single tweet or multiple correct answer. For instance, it would be difficult to determine the correct referent concept for “Gators” in t1 in Figure 1. Linking “UCONN” in t3 to University of Connecticut may also be acceptable since Connecticut Huskies is the athletic team of the university. (iii) prominence, it is challenging to select a set of linkable mentions that are important and relevant. It is not tri</context>

(Meij et al., 2012) studied several supervised machine learning models, but without considering any global evidence either from a single tweet or other relevant tweets. (Guo et al., 2013) explored second order entity-to-entity relations but did not incorporate evidence from multiple tweets. This work is also related to graph-based semisupervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009), which has been successfully applied in many Natural Language Processing tasks (Niu et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006).

Then we define the weight matrix representing the coreferential relation as: Wcoref ij = 4.4 Semantic Relatedness Ensuring topical coherence (Principle 3) has been beneficial for wikification on formal texts (e.g., News) by linking a set of semantically-related mentions to a set of semantically-related concepts simultaneously (Han et al., 2011; Ratinov et al., 2011; Cheng and Roth, 2013). However, the shortness of a single tweet means that it may not provide enough topical clues. Therefore, it is important to extend this evidence to capture semantic relatedness information from multiple tweets. We define the semantic relatedness score between two mentions as SR(mi, mj) = 1.0 if at least one meta path exists between mi and mj, otherwise SR(mi, mj) = 0. In order to compute the semantic relatedness of two concepts ci and cj, we adopt the approach proposed by (Milne and Witten, 2008a): log max(|Ci|, |Cj|) − log |Ci ∩ Cj| SR(ci,cj) = 1−log(|C|) − log min(|Ci|, |Cj|) , where |C |is</context>

The data set was annotated by two annotators. We randomly sample 102 tweets for development and the remaining for evaluation. We use a Wikipedia dump on May 3, 2013 as our knowledge base, which includes 30 million pages. For computational efficiency, we also filter some mention candidates by applying the preprocessing approach proposed in (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010), and remove all the concepts with prior popularity less than 2% from an mention’s concept set for each mention, similar to (Guo et al., 2013). A mention and concept pair (m, c) is judged as correct if and only if m is linkable and c is the correct referent concept for m. To evaluate the performance of a wikification system, we use the standard precision, recall and F1 measures. 6.2 Experimental Results The overall performance of various approaches is shown in Table 2.

In fact, mention detection actually is the performance bottleneck of a tweet wikification system (Guo et al., 2013). Our system performs better in identifying the prominent mention. 6.3 Effect of Concatenated Meta Paths In this work, we propose a unified framework utilizing meta path-based semantic relations to explore richer relevant context. Beyond the basic meta paths, we introduce concatenated ones by concatenating the basic ones. The performance of the system without using the concatenated meta paths is shown in Table 4. In comparison with the system based on all defined meta paths, we can clearly see that the systems using concatenated ones outperform those relying on the simple ones. This is because</context>

(Meij et al., 2012) studied several supervised machine learning models, but without considering any global evidence either from a single tweet or other relevant tweets. (Guo et al., 2013) explored second order entity-to-entity relations but did not incorporate evidence from multiple tweets. This work is also related to graph-based semisupervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009), which has been successfully applied in many Natural Language Processing tasks (Niu et al.</context>

We consider two mentions mi and mj coreferential if mi and mj share the same surface form or one is an abbreviation of the other, and at least one meta path exists between mi and mj. Then we define the weight matrix representing the coreferential relation as: Wcoref ij = 4.4 Semantic Relatedness Ensuring topical coherence (Principle 3) has been beneficial for wikification on formal texts (e.g., News) by linking a set of semantically-related mentions to a set of semantically-related concepts simultaneously (Han et al., 2011; Ratinov et al., 2011; Cheng and Roth, 2013). However, the shortness of a single tweet means that it may not provide enough topical clues. Therefore, it is important to extend this evidence to capture semantic relatedness information from multiple tweets. We define the semantic relatedness score between two mentions as SR(mi, mj) = 1.0 if at least one meta path exists between mi and mj, otherwise SR(mi, mj) = 0. In order to compute the semantic relatedness of two concepts ci and cj, we adopt the approach proposed by (Milne and Witten, 2008a): log max(|Ci|, |Cj|) − log |Ci ∩ Cj| SR(ci,cj) = 1−</context>

Compared to the state-of-the-art supervised model trained from 100% labeled data, our proposed approach achieves comparable performance with 31% labeled data and obtains 5% absolute F1 gain with 50% labeled data. 1 Introduction With millions of tweets posted daily, Twitter enables both individuals and organizations to disseminate information, from current affairs to breaking news in a timely fashion. In this work, we study the wikification (Disambiguation to Wikipedia) task (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007) for tweets, which aims to automatically identify each concept mention in a tweet, and link it to a concept referent in a knowledge base (KB) (e.g., Wikipedia). For example, as shown in Figure 1, Hawks is an identified mention, and its correct referent concept in Wikipedia is Atlanta Hawks.

(Meij et al., 2012) studied several supervised machine learning models, but without considering any global evidence either from a single tweet or other relevant tweets. (Guo et al., 2013) explored second order entity-to-entity relations but did not incorporate evidence from multiple tweets. This work is also related to graph-based semisupervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009), which has been successfully applied in many Natural Language Processing tasks (Niu et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006). We introduce a novel graph that incorporates three fine-grained relations. Our work is further related to meta path-based heterogeneous information network analysis (Sun et al., 2011b; Sun et al., 2011a; Kong et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2013), which has demonstrated advantages over homogeneous information network analysis without differentiating object types and relational links. 8 Conclusions We have introduced a novel semi-supervised graph regularization framework for wikification to simultaneously tackle the unique challenges of annotation and information shortage in s</context>

For example, as shown in Figure 1, Hawks is an identified mention, and its correct referent concept in Wikipedia is Atlanta Hawks. An end-to-end wikification system needs to solve two sub-problems: (i) concept mention detection, (ii) concept mention disambiguation. Wikification is a particularly useful task for short messages such as tweets because it allows a reader to easily grasp the related topics and enriched information from the KB. From a systemto-system perspective, wikification has demonstrated its usefulness in a variety of applications, including coreference resolution (Ratinov and Roth, 2012) and classification (Vitale et al., 2012). Sufficient labeled data is crucial for supervised models. However, manual wikification annotation for short documents is challenging and timeconsuming (Cassidy et al., 2012). The challenges are: (i) unlinkability, a valid concept may not exist in the KB. (ii) ambiguity, it is impossible to determine the correct concept due to the dearth of information within a single tweet or multiple correct answer. For instance, it would be difficult to determine the correct referent concept for “Gators” in t1 in Figure 1. Linking “UCONN” in t3 to University of Conn</context>

Therefore, a collective inference model over multiple tweets in the semi-supervised setting is desirable. For instance, the four tweets in Figure 1 are posted by the same author within a short time period. If we perform collective inference over them we can reliably link ambiguous mentions such as “Gators”, “Hawks”, and “Bucks” to basketball teams instead of other concepts such as the county Bucks County. In order to address these unique challenges for wikification for the short tweets, we employ graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Blum et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) for collective inference by exploiting the manifold (cluster) structure in both unlabeled and labeled data. These approaches normally assume label smoothness over a defined graph, where the nodes represent a set of labeled and unlabeled instances, and the weighted edges reflect the closeness of each pair of instances.

An end-to-end wikification system needs to solve two sub-problems: (i) concept mention detection, (ii) concept mention disambiguation. Wikification is a particularly useful task for short messages such as tweets because it allows a reader to easily grasp the related topics and enriched information from the KB. From a systemto-system perspective, wikification has demonstrated its usefulness in a variety of applications, including coreference resolution (Ratinov and Roth, 2012) and classification (Vitale et al., 2012). Sufficient labeled data is crucial for supervised models. However, manual wikification annotation for short documents is challenging and timeconsuming (Cassidy et al., 2012). The challenges are: (i) unlinkability, a valid concept may not exist in the KB. (ii) ambiguity, it is impossible to determine the correct concept due to the dearth of information within a single tweet or multiple correct answer. For instance, it would be difficult to determine the correct referent concept for “Gators” in t1 in Figure 1.

Concept Mention Extraction Based on the constructed lexicon, we then consider all n-grams of size ≤ n (n=7 in this paper) as concept mention candidates if their entries in the lexicon are not empty. We first segment @usernames and #hashtags into regular tokens (e.g., @amandapalmer is segmented as amanda palmer and #WorldWaterDay is split as World Water Day) using the approach proposed by (Wang et al., 2011). Segmentation assists finding concept candidates for these non-regular mentions. 3 Principles and Approach Overview Figure 2: Approach Overview. 3.1 Principles A single tweet may not provide enough evidence to identify prominent mentions and infer their correct referent concepts due to the lack of contextual information.

Therefore, a collective inference model over multiple tweets in the semi-supervised setting is desirable. For instance, the four tweets in Figure 1 are posted by the same author within a short time period. If we perform collective inference over them we can reliably link ambiguous mentions such as “Gators”, “Hawks”, and “Bucks” to basketball teams instead of other concepts such as the county Bucks County. In order to address these unique challenges for wikification for the short tweets, we employ graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Blum et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) for collective inference by exploiting the manifold (cluster) structure in both unlabeled and labeled data. These approaches normally assume label smoothness over a defined graph, where the nodes represent a set of labeled and unlabeled instances, and the weighted edges reflect the closeness of each pair of instances. In order to construct a semantic-rich graph capturing the similarity between mentions and concepts for the model, we introduce three novel fine-grained relations based on a set of local fe</context>

Then our goal is to refine Yu0 and obtain the final label vector Yu. Intuitively, if two nodes are strongly connected, they tend to hold the same label. We propose a novel semi-supervised graph regularization framework based on the graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm (Zhu et al., 2003): 2(Y) = µ n (yi − yi 0)2 + 1 2 X Wij(yi − yj)2. i=l+1 i,j The first term is a loss function that incorporates the initial labels of unlabeled examples into the model. In our method, we adopt prior popularity (section 4.1) to initialize the labels of the unlabeled examples. The second term is a regularizer that smoothes the refined labels over the constructed graph. µ is a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between initial labels and the consistency of labels on the graph. The goal of the proposed framework is to ensure that the refined labels of unlabeled nodes are consisten</context>

Two most similar methods to ours were proposed by (Meij et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2013) by performing joint detection and disambiguation of mentions. (Meij et al., 2012) studied several supervised machine learning models, but without considering any global evidence either from a single tweet or other relevant tweets. (Guo et al., 2013) explored second order entity-to-entity relations but did not incorporate evidence from multiple tweets. This work is also related to graph-based semisupervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009), which has been successfully applied in many Natural Language Processing tasks (Niu et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006). We introduce a novel graph that incorporates three fine-grained relations. Our work is further related to meta path-based heterogeneous information network analysis (Sun et al., 2011b; Sun et al., 2011a; Kong et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2013), which has demonstrated advantages over homogeneous information network analysis without differentiating object types and relational links. 8 Conclusions We have intr</context>
