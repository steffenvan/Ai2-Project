1 Tutorial Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992805">
Statistical natural language processing relies on
probabilistic models of linguistic structure. More
complex models can help capture our intuitions
about language, by adding linguistically meaning-
ful interactions and latent variables. However, in-
ference and learning in the models we want often
poses a serious computational challenge.
Belief propagation (BP) and its variants pro-
vide an attractive approximate solution, especially
using recent training methods. These approaches
can handle joint models of interacting compo-
nents, are computationally efficient, and have ex-
tended the state-of-the-art on a number of com-
mon NLP tasks, including dependency parsing,
modeling of morphological paradigms, CCG pars-
ing, phrase extraction, semantic role labeling, and
information extraction (Smith and Eisner, 2008;
Dreyer and Eisner, 2009; Auli and Lopez, 2011;
Burkett and Klein, 2012; Naradowsky et al., 2012;
Stoyanov and Eisner, 2012).
This tutorial delves into BP with an emphasis on
recent advances that enable state-of-the-art perfor-
mance in a variety of tasks. Our goal is to eluci-
date how these approaches can easily be applied
to new problems. We also cover the theory under-
lying them. Our target audience is researchers in
human language technologies; we do not assume
familarity with BP.
In the first three sections, we discuss applica-
tions of BP to NLP problems, the basics of mod-
eling with factor graphs and message passing, and
the theoretical underpinnings of “what BP is do-
ing” and how it relates to other variational infer-
ence techniques. In the second three sections, we
cover key extensions to the standard BP algorithm
to enable modeling of linguistic structure, efficient
inference, and approximation-aware training. We
survey a variety of software tools and introduce a
new software framework that incorporates many
of the modern approaches covered in this tutorial.9

Matt Gormley is a PhD student at Johns Hopkins
University working with Mark Dredze and Jason
Eisner. His current research focuses on joint mod-
eling of multiple linguistic strata in learning set-
tings where supervised resources are scarce. He
has authored papers in a variety of areas including
topic modeling, global optimization, semantic role
labeling, and grammar induction.
Jason Eisner is an Associate Professor in Com-
puter Science and Cognitive Science at Johns
Hopkins University, where he has received two
school-wide awards for excellence in teaching.
His 80+ papers have presented many models and
algorithms spanning numerous areas of NLP. His
goal is to develop the probabilistic modeling, in-
ference, and learning techniques needed for a uni-
fied model of all kinds of linguistic structure. In
particular, he and his students introduced struc-
tured belief propagation, which integrates classi-
cal NLP models and their associated dynamic pro-
gramming algorithms, as well as loss-calibrated
training for use with belief propagation.
