Chinese noun classifiers are obligatory as
a category in association with nouns.
Conventional dictionaries include
classifiers as lexical entries but
explanations given are very brief and
thus hardly helpful for L2 learners. This
paper presents a new design of an e-
dictionary of Chinese classifiers. The
design is based on both theoretical
studies of Chinese classifiers and
empirical studies of Chinese classifier
acquisition by both children and adults.
My main argument with regards to
Chinese classifier acquisition is that
cognitive strategies with a bottom-up
approach are the key to the understanding
of the complexity of classifier and noun
associations. The noun-dependent
semantic features of classifiers are
evidence to support my argument. These
features are categorically defined and
stored in a separated database in an e-
learning environment linked to the e-
dictionary. The aim of making such a
design is to provide a platform for L2
learners to explore and learn with a
bottom-up approach the associations of
classifiers with nouns. The computational
agent-based model that automatically
links noun features to that of classifiers is
the technical part of the design that will
be described in detail in the paper. Future
development of the e-dictionary will be
discussed as well.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999818377358491">
Noun classifiers are a typical feature of Chinese
that distinguishes itself from many other
languages. In simple terms, a classifier is a
morpheme or word used to classify a noun
according to its inherent semantic features. Noun
classifiers in Chinese are obligatory as a category
of its own and used to specify a noun when it is
used with a determiner or a numeral. In other
words, A Chinese classifier is never used
independently. It must occur before a noun with
a numeral (e.g., yi ‘one’, liang ‘two’, san ‘three’)
and/or a determiner (e.g., zhe ‘this’, nei ‘that’), or
certain quantifiers (e.g., ji ‘how many’, mei
‘every’). Such a combination is referred to as a
classifier phrase.
However, the definition of Chinese
classifiers is not a simple one. There are different
types of classifiers in terms of their semantic
functions. Some of them carry the unique
features of the Chinese language; others are
representatives of classifier languages, and yet all
of them have the grammatical functions of
measure words, which are a universal category in
all languages. Due to the complexity of classifier
functions, different definitions and classifications
have been found. However, generally speaking,
classifiers refer to common properties of noun
objects across domains and common relations of
objects in the world, rather than to categories
having to do solely with language-internal
relations (Lucy, 1992). Some researchers take a
functional approach and define Chinese
classifiers based on their grammatical functions.
For example, Chao (1968) divides classifiers into
nine categories. They are “classifiers or
individual measures”, “classifiers associated with
v-o”, “group measures”, “partitive measures”,
“container measures”, “temporary measures”,
“standard measures”, “quasi-measures or
autonomous measures”, and “measures for verbs
of action”. From his classification we can see
that he does not distinguish the concept of a
classifier from that of a measure word. The
advantage of such a classification is its inclusion
of all the three types of classifiers mentioned
above and being able to define them all as
measure words, but the disadvantage is that those
that are Chinese specific noun classifiers are all
treated under the universal concept of measure
words. This may be easy for learners to
understand the grammatical functions of Chinese
classifiers but the ontological nature of noun
objects that classifiers are associated with are

largely ignored. In recent decades, researchers
have started to take a cognitive approach to
understand the links between nouns and
classifiers and found it necessary to make a
distinction between classifiers and measure
words. For instance, Tai &amp; Wang (1990:38) state
that “A classifier categorizes a class of nouns by
picking out some salient perceptual properties,
either physically or functionally based, which are
permanently associated with entities named by
the class of nouns; a measure word does not
categorize but denotes the quantity of the entity
named by a noun. ” This definition makes a clear
distinction between a classifier and a measure
word, which is assumed to be helpful for L2
learners to have a better understanding of the
cognitive basis of a classifier system. This is
because there are no measure words in English or
other European languages that can also function
as classifiers in the same sense as Chinese
classifiers. A recent study done by Gao (2010)
has shown that Swedish adult learners of Chinese
had a lower proficiency in classifier application
than their general Chinese proficiency and that
most of them were not aware of the difference
between the concept of a classifier and that of a
measure word.
Other previous studies on classifiers include
descriptive and experimental studies of classifier
systems of natural languages. For example, some
descriptive studies make typological surveys of
classifier systems in different languages (e.g.
Allan, 1977; Lyons, 1977; Goddard, 1998);
others provide semantic analysis of classifiers
and their associated nouns (e.g. Downing, 1993;
Huang &amp; Ahrens, 2003; Matsumoto, 1993), and
some also propose that there is an ontological
base on which classifiers and nouns are
associated with (Sowa 2000; Philpot et al., 2003;
Nichols et al., 2005).
Experimental studies using computer
technology to apply findings of classifier
knowledge to natural language processing (NLP)
have provided a new approach for the semantic
analysis of classifiers (e.g. Nirenburg &amp; Raskin,
2004; Hwang et al., 2007, Quek, 2010) and for
computer-assisted language learning (e.g. Guo &amp;
Zhong, 2005). However, no e-learning systems
developed so far are found to be able to guide
second language learners to use the semantic
properties to understand the links between
classifiers and their associated nouns.
The emergence of computer-assisted
language learning (CALL) provides language
learners with a user-friendly and flexible e-
learning tool. CALL incorporates technology
into the language learning process and also
applies itself across a broad spectrum of teaching
styles, textbooks, and courses (Donaldson &amp;
Haggstrom, 2006). Its bidirectional and
individualized features makes it possible for
learners to use it effectively to improve different
aspects of language skills (e.g. Mallon 2006;
Chang et al., 2008).
My idea of designing the e-dictionary of
Chinese classifiers is similar to that of CALL.
Empirical studies have shown that classifier
learning is a big challenge for L2 learners of
Chinese. My argument with regards to Chinese
classifier acquisition is that cognitive strategies
with a bottom-up approach are the key to the
understanding of the complexity of classifier and
noun associations. Therefore, the design of the e-
dictionary has a focus on guiding learners to
explore the cognitive foundations of classifier-
noun relations. The e-learning system
implemented in the e-dictionary is designed to
promote self-paced accelerated learning. It
consists of a database of the decomposed
semantic features of classifiers and their
associated nouns. These well-defined unique and
non-unique features will help learners to take a
cognitive approach to explore case by case the
matched pairs of classifiers and nouns. Currently
the e-dictionary has included 168 noun classifiers
and 680 nouns, of which 80 classifiers and 560
nouns have been analysed and entered into the e-
learning database. My aim is to define and
include all Chinese classifiers and their
associated nouns&apos; and eventually link them to the
e-learning system.

2 Multi-categorization of Classifiers

<bodyText confidence="0.97023425">
In cognitive linguistics, categories are defined by
groups of features and relationships within a
same family. From this viewpoint, the
&apos; Eleven classifier dictionaries are consulted (see
References). The number of classifiers listed in them ranges
from 143 to 422 and the number of associated nouns is from
388 to 8609. However, if we follow Tai and Wang’s (1990)
definition of classifiers, 178 of them are true classifiers.

occurrence of a noun with a particular classifier
is dependent upon the categorical features of
both nouns and classifiers. However, the internal
semantic network of categories may be
ambiguous due to historical and social factors,
which makes categorization dependent on not
only noun referents’ intrinsic properties but also
their functional and human perceptual ones. In
other words, classifier and noun associations
encode as well human cognitive understandings
of the real world entities. As a result, classifiers
are found to be able to link nouns cross-
categorically. That is, one single classifier can
associate itself with a number of nouns from
different noun categories and at the same time
one single noun from certain categories can be
associated with not one but two classifiers. This
multiple-categorization nature of classifiers
complicates the classification of classifiers and
nouns for the purpose of providing an effective
learning strategy. It is also virtually impossible
for linguists to build a meta-theory for a
systematic organization of any clear logical
classifier-noun categories and thus hard for
lexicographers to find an effective way to
illustrate the semantic connections between
classifiers and nouns. However, one thing we are
clear about is that the main obstacles in classifier
acquisition are that the inhabited meaning
associations in the nature of classifiers are
opaque and that the complex classifier
associations with nouns have caused noun
categorizations to be linguistically
unconventional. Yet, from a cognitive viewpoint,
these associations and categorizations can
provide cognitive motivations to learners if we
can provide a learning tool that allows them to
pay attention to the pragmatic use of classifiers
on a cognitive basis.

3 Semantic Decomposition of Classifiers
and Nouns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863983333333">
Table 1 is a demonstration of the semantic
features of some most commonly used noun
classifiers and their associated nouns. A total of
168 classifiers are collected and sorted out
according to the number of noun categories each
classifier is associated with. One special feature
of this dictionary design is that the classifiers’
associated nouns are grouped into categories
based on the real-world entities as noun
referents. Currently I have defined the following
11 categories in the e-dictionary: “nature,
humans &amp; body parts”, “animals”, “vegetables &amp;
fruits”, “man-made objects”, “buildings”,
“clothing”, “food”, “furniture”, “tools” and
“vehicles”. A hierarchy of noun classifiers is
built up according to the number of noun
categories they enter into. For instance, the
classifier liang occurs only in the “vehicles”
category, (e.g. car, lorry, bicycle, etc.). Out of the
168 classifiers, 149 occur in fewer than 3 noun
categories. The cognitive mapping between these
149 classifiers and their associated nouns are
straightforward. Hence it is relatively easy for
users to quickly have a big picture of how a
classifier is associated with certain type(s) of
nouns. For the rest of 19 classifiers listed in
Table 1, each occurs in at least 3 noun categories.
At the current stage my work focuses on
individual noun classifiers; the other types of
classifiers will be added in the future when more
people are involved in the project. In the e-
learning part of the dictionary, I temporarily
exclude the general classifier ge because
cognitively it is not assumed to be a difficult one
to learn.
Through semantic decomposition, the
cognitive mapping between a classifier and its
associated nouns is revealed. Take the classifier
tiao for example. It is associated with nouns such
as rainbow, leg, snake, cucumber, road, scarf,
potato chip, boat and necklace, which are from 9
of the 11 noun categories listed above. Despite of
the different categories they belong to, the 9
nouns share one same cognitive property – the
shape of the noun referents that is defined as
“longitudinal”. This shows that the classifier tiao
is inhabited with this semantic feature as a
cognitive basis and links itself to the nouns
accordingly.
Similarly, the classifier gen is connected to
the nouns such as stick, bone, banana, pillar,
sausage, needle, and ribbon that belong to 7
noun categories respectively. These nouns
possess the same “longitudinal” feature as tiao.
This shows that extracting one same feature from
gen and tiao is not helpful enough for learners to
understand the difference between the two
classifiers, though classifying nouns into
categories can constrain the interference to
learners to some extent. What needs to be carried
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999936642857143">
out is to define each noun with a unique feature
of its own, no matter whether they are from its
lexical semantic meanings, pragmatic functions,
or human perceptions. For instance, besides
“longitudinal”, “for supporting walking” is added
as a feature to stick, “a piece of human skeleton”
to bone, “turns from green to yellow when ripe”
to banana, “one end stuck to the ground” to
pillar, etc. More are needed until finally each
noun is distinguished from other nouns that are
associated with the same classifier. These feature
extractions and definitions are the core part of
the database for the e-learning tool linked to the
e-dictionary.

classifier acquisition
In this section we describe an approach that can
enhance the practical use of the classifier
dictionary. Developed in the software
environment of FileMaker Pro 8.5 (see Figure 2),
the dictionary is established within a database
system. Categorical records created as data files
are used to store the associated nouns. The
records created so far include 11 categories of
nouns described in Section 3. Such a
categorization appears explicit, but its top-down
approach fails to reveal the feature-based
mapping between a classifier and its associated
nouns. However, the e-learning part of the
dictionary can guide learners to search for correct
classifier and noun pairs by looking for the
defined features of the noun referents in a
different database, firstly from those broadly
defined as “animacy”, “shape”, “size”,
“thickness”, “length”, “function”, etc., to those
specific ones extracted from each particular noun
referent.
With such a bottom-up approach, the e-
dictionary allows users to learn the particular
interrelated features of a classifier and its
associated noun referents in a case-by-case
fashion. In this way, learners can better
understand the point that a classifier reflects the
cognitive classification of its associated noun
referents. Each individual record thus contains
both general and specific information of a
classifier and its associated nouns as data entries.
The features decomposed from the noun
referents are defined and recorded as
independent data entries linked to the e-learning
tool. For instance, if a learner wants to know
which classifier is the correct one for boat, he
can enter the word boat, finds its category as
“vehicles”, choose its shape as “longitudinal”.
Then, tiao should automatically pop up in this
case because boat is the only noun referent from
the “vehicles” category (see Table 2). In other
cases where there are two or more items that are
featured as “longitudinal”, the learner will be
guided to look for a more specific or unique
feature with a few more clicks on the users’
interface.
The e-learning environment in the dictionary
also provides learners the noun-classifier phrases
that are commonly used but they may not be easy
for learners to acquire. Take the noun classifier
zhi for example. It is associated with noun
referents that belong to “animals and body-parts”,
and “man-made objects”, such as bird, hand, pen,
etc. The unique perceptual features of these noun
referents are identified and built into the e-
learning system so that users can click different
categories in the interface to make particular
associations as long as they have some general
knowledge of the entities, such as their functions
and perceptual features, etc.

4.2 Implementation of Agent-based Model in
Classifier E-learning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988862">
The e-learning tool in our classifier e-dictionary
is targeted for automatic classifier-noun
associations. By adopting an agent-based model
(Holland, 1995), wee have developed a classifier-
noun network for learners to learn step by step
classifier phrases. Included in the prototype
model will be nouns and classifiers, divided into
two groups of agents. To design a semantic
interface between the two types of agents with a
computational approach, a tag is attached to each
agent. The tags are of opposite polarity, one to a
noun, and the other to a classifier. Each tag is a
pseudo-binary-bit string of {0, 1, #}, where “#”
is the “doesn’t care” symbol. The position a
symbol occupies in the string corresponds to a
particular semantic feature of the agent, with “#”

indicating that the corresponding feature is not
critical for the formulation of the classifier
phrase, even though the noun referent owns such
a feature. When a noun agent meets a classifier
agent, we line up the two tags and match the
digits in one string with those in the other
position by position. To report a match score at
the end of this comparison, there are three match
rules to follow: (i) it scores 1 given there is a
match between two “1”s or between two “0”s;
(ii) it scores 0 given there is a match between a
“1” and a “#” or a “0” and a “#” or between two
“#”s; (iii) it scores -1 given there is a match
between a “1” and a “0”. The aggregate match
score indicates the likeliness of a correct
classifier phrase with the involved classifier and
the noun.
More specifically, in this model each tag
consists of 4 pseudo-binary bits. Out of the
noun’s many semantic features, let’s selectively
represent two of them: the first feature with the
first two symbols, and the second with the last
two. For example, a tag “1100” is assigned to the
agent (noun) leg to represent the noun’s features
defined as “longitudinal” and “body-part”
respectively. In this case, “longitudinal” might be
considered as the most salient feature of leg with
regards to the selection of a classifier. Hence, it
is represented by “11”. On the other hand, if
“longitudinal” is by no means an external or
internal feature of the associated noun referent,
the symbols at the corresponding positions would
be “00”. Other possible combinations of symbols
such as “01” and “10” are reserved for fuzzy
states, which are associated with marginally
accepted classifier phrases.
Besides, the noun referent leg also has a
“body-part” property listed, but it is not of
primary importance for finding its classifier
match. Therefore, it is represented by “##” at the
last two string positions, rather than explicitly
indicated by any of the four combinations
mentioned above.
We assign the tags to classifier agents in a
similar way. For instance, “11##” may be
assigned to the classifier tiao, due to the fact that
tiao often occurs in a classifier phrase with nouns
defined as having “longitudinal” features. On the
other hand, “##11” may be assigned to the noun
classifier zhi, which is commonly applied to
noun referents of body-part.
Regarding the agent’s interaction with those
agents of classifiers, when the tag “1100” of leg
is compared with the tag “11##” of the agent
tiao, the match score is 1+1+0+0 = 2. In contrast,
its match score with the tag “##11” of the agent
zhi is reported as 0+0+0+0 = -2. The match score
2 indicates tiao is more likely to be linked to leg,
and the match score -2 implies an undesirable
match between leg and zhi. It is noteworthy,
however, that if a user assigns “1111” to leg,
they will obtain a match score of 2 (0+0+1+1)
with zhi. They will hence conclude that, beside
tiao, zhi is another correct classifier for leg.
In addition, we include the defined features
of nouns and classifiers as a group of interactive
agents. This group is designed to facilitate the
learning process from learner’s perspective. Take
L2 learners for example. First they may learn that
tiao is the correct classifier for leg because the
noun referent of leg has the longitudinal
attribute. Next, they tend to look for other nouns
with the longitudinal feature, such as necklace
and snake, and to verify whether tiao is also the
correct classifier for these nouns. By establishing
the mapping between the defined features of
nouns and classifiers, the agent-based model
explicitly shows learners the possible
connections between these groups of agents.
Among the semantic features, some are
defined as unique features which distinguish
their corresponding nouns from the rest of the
nouns’ group. For instance, we may define
“chained jewel” as the unique feature of a
necklace, and “limbless reptile, some of which
produce venom” as that of a snake (see Figure 1).
We assign two kinds of tags respectively, one for
non-unique feature agents and the other for
unique feature agents. Each non-unique feature
agent is attached with an adhesion tag (Holland,
1995). This adhesion tag provides the possibility
of forming multi-feature agent aggregates with
individual unique feature agents. On the other
hand, each unique semantic feature is attached
with a two-segment tag. The first segment plays
the same role as the classifier/noun tag, which
controls the agent’s interaction with agents of
other groups, i.e. nouns and noun classifiers. The
second segment functions simply as an adhesion
tag. To decide whether to form a multi-feature
agent aggregate, we can match a non-unique
feature agent’s adhesion tag and the second
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996499">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931035714286">
segment of a unique feature agent’s tag. The
match score is calculated in a similar way with
that between noun’s agents and classifier’s
agents. To simplify the discussion, we assume
that adhesion only occurs between one unique
feature agent and one or more non-unique feature
agents. In other words, adhesion does not occur
between either two unique feature agents or two
non-unique feature agents.
To explicitly show the cognitive mapping
between classifiers/nouns and their features, we
use a collection of condition/action if-then rules
(Holland, 1995). In our model, both the condition
and the action are linguistic variables, which are
in turn represented by pseudo-binary-bit strings.
The rules represent the interconnection among
the agent group of classifiers, the agent group of
nouns, and the group of defined features. For
instance, the same noun classifier tiao occurs in
the classifier phrase yi tiao xianglian ‘a
necklace’. Let ①, ② and ③ respectively denote
the features of “chained jewel”, “man-made”,
and “longitudinal”, where ① is the unique
feature to identify the noun referent of necklace.
As discussed previously, the individual features
①, ②, and ③ can form a multi-feature agent
aggregate, which we denote as ①②③. The if-
then Rule 1 can be implemented as:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.344447">
Rule 1: {If (①②③) Then (necklace)}.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.905371125">
Following the tag interaction approach discussed
previously in this section, Rule 2 can be
implemented to reflect the inter-agent
communication between the noun and its
classifier:
Rule 2: {If (necklace) Then (tiao)}.
Based on these two rules, Rule 3 can be
implemented as
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.500805">
Rule 3: {If (①②③) Then (tiao)}.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939111111111">
Note that Rule 3 has the same input (condition)
with Rule 1 and the same output (action) with
Rule 2. Rule 1 outputs its action as a message,
which is subsequently received by Rule 2 as its
condition. This is an example of transitivity, a
property of the rule-based network. The
condition and action part in each of the three
rules could also be exchanged to implement three
inverse rules.
Now let’s take a look at the noun snake and
its classifier tiao. Given that ④ represents
“animate” and ⑤ represents “limbless reptile,
some of which produce venom”, we can retrieve
③, ④, ⑤ from the features’ group and form
them as another multi-feature agent aggregate as
③④⑤. Here ⑤ is the unique feature of snake.
We add another three if-then rules concerned
with snake and tiao as follows:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.939442333333333">
Rule 4: {If (③④⑤) Then (snake)};
Rule 5: {If (snake) Then (tiao)};
Rule 6: {If (③④⑤) Then (tiao)}.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999753916666667">
So far only multi-feature agent aggregate, rather
than single feature agents are used as conditions.
It is also noteworthy that non-unique feature
agents are incapable of interacting directly with
noun agents or classifier agents, since their
adhesion tags cannot be matched with the
classifier/noun tags. The property of transitivity
implies, however, that we can establish the
mapping between nouns and non-unique feature
agents indirectly. For example, we represent the
relation between the noun necklace and the
unique feature agent ① “chained jewel” by Rule

In Rule 11 and 12, the noun is taken as the input
and the non-unique semantic feature as the
output. By swapping the two kinds of agents’
roles in the message-processing rules, we may
inversely implement Rule 13 by taking the non-
unique feature as the input and the noun as the
output. If a learner chooses s0 as the single input
agent, two possible outputs pop up for his/her
selection.
Rule 13: {If (s0) Then (necklace or snake)}
More rules could be added in the classifier
network by selecting different agents from the
three groups in a similar way as we implement
Rule 1-13. In this way the if-then rule-based
network explicitly shows the cognitive mapping
between the classifiers and their associated
nouns. Learners will find out the association
between the target words and their features,
which are essential for their classifier acquisition.
So far we have tested some commonly used
classifiers and their associated nouns selected
from the e-dictionary and tried within the agent-
based model. The automatic matching is
successful, though more pairs need to be tested.

This paper presents a feature-based approach in
designing a classifier e-dictionary with an e-
learning environment created for learners to use
cognitive strategies to explore and learn the
classifier phrases.
The current dictionary is based on a database
with classes of nouns (11 classes at present) and
classifiers (168 added) that are stored as
individual records. The records are not organized
according to the lexical meanings of the words.
Instead, the classification scheme is based on the
noun referents’ semantic and salient external or
functional features. The objective of the design is
to use such features to set up a classifier network
that can automatically associate all possible
nouns. A computer-based model with such a
design is expected to show learners of Chinese
the cognitive base of linguistic combinations.
The proposed agent-based model uses the match
between pseudo-binary-bit strings to indicate the
probability of interactions between agents. It
hence predicts how likely a classifier and a noun
occurs in a classifier phrase. The relations among
the agent groups are shown within the framework
of the if-then rule-based network. Learners can
explore case by case, when using the dictionary’s
e-learning function, the classifier and noun
associations and the defined features that the
associations are based on. The future task is to
include the rest of the classifiers and all possible
associated nouns. Linguistically, a challenge to
carry out the task would be the definitions of the
unique features of the noun referents and their
classifiers that have fuzzy boundaries.
Technically, the challenge would be the solution
to making perfect matches of those cases where
one classifier agent as input is expected to link
automatically a number of noun agents as output,
which should follow a step-by-step procedure
that is interesting and effective from learners’
perspective.

<abstract confidence="0.997915942857143">Chinese noun classifiers are obligatory a category in association with nouns. Conventional dictionaries classifiers as lexical entries but explanations given are very brief and thus hardly helpful for L2 learners. This paper presents a new design of an edictionary of Chinese classifiers. The design is based on both theoretical studies of Chinese classifiers and empirical studies of Chinese classifier acquisition by both children and adults. My main argument with regards to Chinese classifier acquisition is that cognitive strategies with a bottom-up approach are the key to the understanding of the complexity of classifier and noun associations. The noun-dependent semantic features of classifiers are evidence to support my argument. These features are categorically defined and stored in a separated database in an elearning environment linked to the edictionary. The aim of making such a design is to provide a platform for L2 learners to explore and learn with a bottom-up approach the associations of classifiers with nouns. The computational agent-based model that automatically links noun features to that of classifiers is the technical part of the design that will be described in detail in the paper. Future development of the e-dictionary will be discussed as well.</abstract>

Other previous studies on classifiers include descriptive and experimental studies of classifier systems of natural languages. For example, some descriptive studies make typological surveys of classifier systems in different languages (e.g. Allan, 1977; Lyons, 1977; Goddard, 1998); others provide semantic analysis of classifiers and their associated nouns (e.g. Downing, 1993; Huang &amp; Ahrens, 2003; Matsumoto, 1993), and some also propose that there is an ontological base on which classifiers and nouns are associated with (Sowa 2000; Philpot et al., 2003; Nichols et al., 2005).

Due to the complexity of classifier functions, different definitions and classifications have been found. However, generally speaking, classifiers refer to common properties of noun objects across domains and common relations of objects in the world, rather than to categories having to do solely with language-internal relations (Lucy, 1992). Some researchers take a functional approach and define Chinese classifiers based on their grammatical functions. For example, Chao (1968) divides classifiers into nine categories. They are “classifiers or individual measures”, “classifiers associated with v-o”, “group measures”, “partitive measures”, “container measures”, “temporary measures”, “standard measures”, “quasi-measures or autonomous measures”, and “measures for verbs of action”. From his classification we can see that he does not distinguish the concept of a classifier from that of a measure word. The advantage of such a classification is its inclusion of all the three types of classifiers mentioned above and being able to define them all as measure words, but the di</context>

Experimental studies using computer technology to apply findings of classifier knowledge to natural language processing (NLP) have provided a new approach for the semantic analysis of classifiers (e.g. Nirenburg &amp; Raskin, 2004; Hwang et al., 2007, Quek, 2010) and for computer-assisted language learning (e.g. Guo &amp; Zhong, 2005).

The emergence of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) provides language learners with a user-friendly and flexible elearning tool. CALL incorporates technology into the language learning process and also applies itself across a broad spectrum of teaching styles, textbooks, and courses (Donaldson &amp; Haggstrom, 2006). Its bidirectional and individualized features makes it possible for learners to use it effectively to improve different aspects of language skills (e.g. Mallon 2006; Chang et al., 2008). My idea of designing the e-dictionary of Chinese classifiers is similar to that of CALL. Empirical studies have shown that classifier learning is a big challenge for L2 learners of Chinese. My argument with regards to Chinese classifier acquisition is that cognitive strategies with a bottom-up approach are the key to the understanding of the complexity of classifier and noun associations. Therefore, the design of the edictionary has a focus on guiding learners to explore the cognitive foundations of classifiernoun relations. The e-learning system implemented in the e-dic</context>

For instance, Tai &amp; Wang (1990:38) state that “A classifier categorizes a class of nouns by picking out some salient perceptual properties, either physically or functionally based, which are permanently associated with entities named by the class of nouns; a measure word does not categorize but denotes the quantity of the entity named by a noun. ” This definition makes a clear distinction between a classifier and a measure word, which is assumed to be helpful for L2 learners to have a better understanding of the cognitive basis of a classifier system.
