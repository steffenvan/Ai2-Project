Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999435">
We present the first stage of the discursive anno-
tation of a corpus in Spanish. In contrast with
previous annotation projects, we have applied a
feature-based description of discourse relations,
and we have focussed in the low level organiza-
tion of discourse.
This first annotation phase has served to set-
tle the annotation framework and to provide em-
pirical support to theoretical claims. Systematic
guidelines have been established for the interpre-
tation of relations between discourse units, by
tests and interpretation procedures that charac-
terize the presence of the features characterizing
discourse relations.

1 Introduction and Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98392752">
Annotated corpora have shown to be very useful
to build, evaluate or improve linguistic resources
and computational analyzers. Big corpora en-
riched with linguistic information at sentential
and sub-sentential level (morphologic, syntac-
tic, semantic) are widely available, but they are
scarce and fragmentary at discourse level.
Nevertheless, more and more efforts have been
devoted to create discursively annotated corpora
in recent years, mainly for English. Various an-
notation schemata have been developed in order
to improve the consistency of annotation and to
reduce the annotation cost (Discourse Resource
Initiative, 1997; Cooper et al., 1999; Carlson
and Marcu, 2001).
In this paper we present a schema for discur-
sive annotation of Spanish written corpora fo-
cussed in the low level organization of discourse.
Relations between discourse units are described
as a conglomerate of features, instead of assign-
ing them atomic labels.
This annotation is specially oriented to im-
prove text summarization and question answer-
ing. Therefore, we have focussed in those as-
pects of discourse that allow to identify coher-
ence relations and relative relevance, two as-
pects of discourse that are necessary to produce
readable texts and to condensate information,
respectively. We have disregarded those dis-
tinctions that are beyond the capabilities of the
state-of-the-art analyzers for Spanish.
We focus in the low level of discourse be-
cause it consitutes a natural enhancement of the
NLP pipeline towards discourse, but also be-
cause a reliable and informative representation
of low level discourse can be obtained with shal-
low linguistic information. However, this kind of
information comes short to resolve ambiguities
at higher levels.
A feature-based annotation schema seems
to be descriptively more adequate than relation-
based approaches, like those based in the
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and
Thompson, 1988). In these approaches, rela-
tions between discourse units are described by
assigning them an atomic label. However, dis-
course relations can convey various kinds of
meaning simultaneously (Moore and Pollack,
1992), which atomic labels fail to distinguish.
In contrast, if relations between discourse
units are described compositionally, heteroge-
neous meanings can be expressed in a distinct,
transparent manner. Such a description is ar-
guably more adaptable to different necessities of
representation, and also more comparable with
other theoretical frameworks. Moreover, the in-
terpretation of discourse relations can be sys-
tematized by associating tests and decision pro-
cedures to each distinct feature, in order to im-
prove the consistency of annotation.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
Our theoretical framework is sketched in Sec-
tion 2, its descriptive adequacy is discussed in
Section 3, comparing it with related work. Sec-
tion 4 describes the schema for corpus annota-
tion based in this framework. The results of an
exploratory corpus annotation are discussed in
Section 5, and implications are put forward.

Segments 6 and 7 are chosen as the condensation of the information conveyed by the text; segment
7 introduces a progression, which indicates that it conveys relevant information; segment 6 has a
coherence relation with 7, namely, the fact that it is its dominating node in the hierarchical structure
of discourse.
2 The low level of discourse
Under the term &amp;quot;low level of discourse&amp;quot; we
group those phenomena that cannot be ex-
plained within a clausal scope (like anaphora,
coherence relations, illocutionary force, etc.)
but that are realized by features of utterances
at sentential level (like syntactic constructions,
referential expressions discourse particles, etc.).
Our description of the low level of discourse
is focussed on coherence and relative relevance
relations between minimal discourse units. This
information is useful to produce coherent sum-
maries of texts, as illustrated in Figure 1.
More concretely, we aim to describe extra-
argumental relations between sentence con-
stituents&apos; that have the status of discourse
unit, and also comparable relations between sen-
tences. We believe that these relations are basic
linguistic mechanisms that hold for virtually ev-
ery kind of text, oral or written, and can be de-
scribed independently of higher-level discourse
structures, like genres or domains.

For space constraints, we are not providing ex-
tensive grounding here on the nature of dis-
course units. Our position is roughly based in
the classical Linguistic Discourse Model, as re-
cently synthesized by Polanyi et al. (2004).
Two kinds of minimal discourse units are con-
sidered: discourse segments, &amp;quot;syntactic con-

stitutents, because their distributional properties are
strongly equivalent to those of a phrase.
structions that encode a minimum unit of mean-
ing and/or discourse function interpretable rel-
ative to a set of contexts&amp;quot; (Polanyi et al., 2004)
and discourse markers, functional units that
convey information on the relations between seg-
ments. However, discourse segments can func-
tion as discourse markers, as in example (1),
where the underlined segment elicits a relation
between its matrix clause and a previous dis-
course unit, in this case, a grouping of segments.
In our annotation schema allows segments can
be characterized with the functional information
that is characteristic of discourse markers.

2.2 Proposed features of the meaning
of discourse relations
We have established eight basic features to de-
scribe the meaning of discourse relations in var-
ious dimensions of discourse meaning simulta-
neously, summarized in Table 1. These features
do not aim to provide a comprehensive descrip-
tion of relations between discourse segments, in-
stead, we have focussed in aspects of discourse
useful to identify relevance and coherence rela-
tions between discourse segments and treatable
by shallow NLP, that is, that are identifiable in
text by surface clues, like syntactical construc-
tions, lexical and referential chains and, most of
all, discourse markers.
Features are organized in three co-existing di-
mensions (Alonso et al., 2003):
structural (coordinating, subordinating) ex-
presses the relation between a discourse seg-
ment and the node where it is attached in a
tree-like structure of discourse as that pro-
posed by Webber (1978) or Polanyi (1988).
argumentation (progression, elaboration) de-
scribes the relation of segments with inten-
tions and/or topics, similar to Grosz and
Sidner (1986) intentional/attentional levels
matter (context, causality, parallelism) ac-
counts for extra-argumental relations be-
tween the propositional content of dis-
course segments. It is comparable to Hal-
liday and Hasan (1976)&apos;s internal, Mann
and Thompson (1988)&apos;s subject-matter, or
Kehler (2002)&apos;s discourse relations.

3 Discussion of features of meaning
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986885">
3.1 Relation with previous work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993780148148148">
A number of components of meaning have been
proposed in the literature to describe discourse
relations, either explicitly as distinct features
or implicitly as part of the meaning of atomic
labels. Some of them are strongly equivalent
to the ones we propose here, but some others
have been ignored, either because they are be-
yond our shallow NLP capabilities or because we
don&apos;t believe that they make relevant distinc-
tions for information condensation tasks. We
will discuss some of them in this section.
We have not distinguished subtypes of con-
text, like manner, instrument, location or the
popular family of temporal relations, because
we believe that relevant distinctions within this
range of meaning are strongly dependent on the
final application. Basic coherence and relevance
assessment seems to be independent of finer-
grained distinctions within this meaning.
We believe the distinction between voli-
tional and non-volitional relations (Mann and
Thompson, 1988) is not useful for informa-
tion condensation. Other distinctions within
the family of causal relations can be ob-
tained by combination of the proposed fea-
tures. For example, purpose can be expressed as
asymmetric+progression+ cause, consequence
as symmetric+progression+cause, and reason
as asymmetric + elaboration + cause.
In contrast, the distinction between seman-
tic and pragmatic source of coherence (Sweetser,
1990; Sanders et al., 1992; Knott, 1996) makes
useful distinctions to preserve coherence when
texts are condensated. In a semantic relation,
like that in (3.a), both related segments con-
tribute to the full understanding of the de-
scribed situation. In contrast, a segment related
to another by a pragmatic relation, as the un-
derlined segment in example (3.b), does not con-
tribute to describe the situation, but elicits a re-
lation between the illucotionary forces of the re-
lad segments. Therefore, if the target is to pro-
duce a semantically coherent text, a pragmatic
relation is useful to identify accessory segments,
while it will signal relevant segments if the tar-
get is to compare sources of information that
may be contradictory.
(3) (3.a) [..] the judge is believed to have added 25
per cent to each sentence specifically
because the police had carried out the
attack while operating in their official
capacity.
(3.b) I would be so grateful if you could tell me
the name of it, because it looks so
unusual.
Despite the utility of this distinction, we have
not included source of coherence as a basic fea-
ture of meaning because it is beyond our NLP
capabilities to distinguish pragmatic and seman-
tic relations. Indeed, these relations tend to be
signalled by the same shallow cues; for example,
most causal discourse markers can be used for
marking semantic or pragmatic relations indis-
tinctively.
Finally, structural features are not equivalent
to SDRT coordinating and subordinating (Asher
and Vieu, 2001) or to RST nuclearity. Indeed,
asymmetric does not always imply subordinating
or satellite; as in example (2.a), where the un-
derlined segment holds an asymmetric relation
with its matrix clause but is not discursively
subordinated. In our annotation schema, dis-
cursive subordination is obtained composition-
ally; typically, a subordinating relation is an
asymmetric relation of elaboration. For some
representation purposes, interactions with some
matter meaning may determine whether such a
relation is considered subordinating or not; for
example, it can be stipulated that causal rela-
tions are never subordinating, independently of
their structural and argumentative features.

3.2 Descripive adequacy of the
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991565277777778">
presented features
Our feature-based account is specially adequate
to deal with ambiguity, both for human and au-
tomated analyses. In relation-based approaches,
unclear cases are treated in an &amp;quot;all or nothing&amp;quot;
basis, that is, either they are assigned no label
or a label of dubious descriptive adequacy. In a
feature-based approach, meaning is partitioned
so that underspecification can affect only part
of the meaning of the relation.
A feature-based account is specially adequate
to integrate heterogeneous kinds of informa-
tion in a systematic way. For example, dis-
course markers are very informative of matter
and structural dimensions, but most of them
do not convey strong argumentative informa-
tion. Consequently, relations between segments
marked by a discourse marker may obtain their
argumentative information from the topical or
intentional structures of text, or from the syn-
tactical structures of the utterance, while the
rest of features can be determined by the dis-
course marker.
If a single dimension of discourse is consid-
ered, the example in Figure 2 can only be ad-
equately described by a DAG. Webber et al.
(2003) avoid to treat this kind of cases as a DAG
by exploiting the anaphoric properties of aver-
bial discourse markers like then, as shown in the
left of Figure 2. We explain it by resorting to dif-
ferent dimensions of discursive meaning, as seen
in the example in the right, where solid lines rep-
resent the matter dimension, dashed lines repre-
sent the argumentative dimension and the struc-
tural dimension is represented by the relative
level of terminal discourse units.

The corpus consists of 6 articles totalling 3541
words (from 207 to 1042 words) in 154 sen-
tences. Texts have been manually segmented
in discourse minimal units, discourse segments
and discourse markers, as defined in Section 2.1.
There are 468 intrasentential segments, of which
84 are required by the argumental structure of
the verb (as in example 2.a) and the rest are
different kinds of adjuncts, of which 226 are
dominated by a discourse marker. 261 discourse
markers have been found, corresponding to 101
different forms, the most frequent are y (and,

4.2 Annotation procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998336955555555">
Three judges have taken part in this preliminary
annotation, two naive judges, with no back-
ground in linguistics, and a linguist. The pur-
pose of having naive judges annotate the corpus
was to check the intuitivity of the proposed fea-
tures. After each text was annotated, the an-
notation was discussed between judges, but the
annotated text was not modified.
Judges made decisions basically relying on
their intuitions. However, as an aid to guide
decision-taking, an annotation manual was cre-
ated (Alonso et al., 2004), and a preparatory
text was annotated collaboratively. The man-
ual was enhanced and refined during annotation,
with issues that were specially controversial, like
the annotation of discontinuous discourse mark-
ers (so... that...) or an effective procedure to
systematize the assignment of matter features
to syntactical constructions like relative clauses
or absolute participles.
The procedure for annotation is as follows:
once a judge has read the whole text, discourse
segments are characterized one by one in order
of occurrence in the text, by the following fea-
tures: node(s) of attachment, features of
meaning and glosses for the selected features.
4.2.1 Node of attachment
The value for this attribute depends on the kind
of discourse unit: segments are assigned the
identification number(s) of the node(s) where
they are attached in the tree-like structure of
discourse. In contrast, discourse markers are
assigned the identification number of the nodes
they relate. These nodes can be minimal dis-
course segments or discourse units constituted
by continuous spans of discourse segments.
However, segments with a relating function
(as in example 1) are assigned the same kind of
value as a discourse marker, that is, the iden-
tification numbers of the segments they relate.
Contrastively, discourse markers that do not re-
late discourse segments, like those relating the
text with the author (for example luckily or of
course), can be attached to the discourse seg-
ment where they are found.

Figure 3: Decision tree for annotating features belonging to the matter dimension. It reflects the
characterization of features presented in Table 1: decisions are taken in order of markedness, so that
it is first discriminated whether the most marked feature (revision) is present or not. Finer-grained

Each segment is related to at least one other
segment. When there is no clear attachment
node or when the segment is the starting point
or main claim of a text, it is considered the top
of a local structure, and is attached to itself.
Each segment carries the information for its
own attachment to other segments, but none for
the attachment of other segments to it. The
most marked segment in a relation is the one
that carries the information, usually, segments
under the scope of a discourse marker or charac-
terized by redundant lexic or referential expres-
sions. If there is no difference in markedness be-
tween segments, those coming later in discourse
are the ones to carry the information. Note that
markedness has no relation with RST&apos;s nuclear-
ity, since marked segments can be the nucleus
or the satellite of a relation.

When judges were unsure about a feature for

sulted in an average of 2.6 features per relation,

quite low, and does not guarantee a good repro-

Interestingly, kappa agreement for discourse
markers is significantly lower than the aver-
age, except in the case of the revision feature,
which presents the highest agreement per fea-
ture. However, the number of features for char-
acterizing discourse markers was higher than the
average, which means that judges recognized
them as highly informative of discourse organi-
zation but were not able to distinguish clearly
the components of their meaning.
As can be seen by the low agreement for
segments occurring at the beginning of para-
graph, they were very difficult to characterize
for judges, which seems to indicate that the co-
herence mechanisms that apply at paragraph
level are qualitatively different from those at
sentential and inter-sentential level. This seems
a strong argument to treat the low level orga-
nization of discourse as an autonomous level of
language.
Although judges had been allowed to relate
segments to more than one discourse unit by
more than one relation, this never happened in
the corpus. This supports the claim that dis-
course can be represented as a hierarchical tree.
In our framework, the structure of discourse is
described as a superposition of the hierarchical
trees that represent each dimension, where seg-
ments have only one relation in each dimension,
although they might be attached to different
segments in different dimensions (see Figure 2).

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986818181818">
We have annotated a corpus with a feature-
based approach to the description of the orga-
nization of low level discourse. We have carried
out an annotation of a small corpus in Spanish,
and we have established an annotation frame-
work in the form of systematic procedures for
decision taking. These procedures are a direct
mapping of the theoretical characterization of
the basic components of meaning of discourse
relations.
The consistency of this preliminary annota-
tion is comparable to that of the preliminary
stages of other annotation initiatives. The fact
that two of the three annotators involved had
no background in linguistics supports the valid-
ity of the proposed features as basic components
of meaning of discourse relations.
Future work will be aimed to the application
of this annotation framework to a Spanish cor-
pus of a reasonable size, most probably a subset
of the CLiC-TALP corpus, which is currently
being annotated with syntactic functions.

The purpose of having naive judges annotate the corpus was to check the intuitivity of the proposed features. After each text was annotated, the annotation was discussed between judges, but the annotated text was not modified. Judges made decisions basically relying on their intuitions. However, as an aid to guide decision-taking, an annotation manual was created (Alonso et al., 2004), and a preparatory text was annotated collaboratively. The manual was enhanced and refined during annotation, with issues that were specially controversial, like the annotation of discontinuous discourse markers (so... that...) or an effective procedure to systematize the assignment of matter features to syntactical constructions like relative clauses or absolute participles. The procedure for annotation is as follows: once a judge has read the whole text, discourse segments are characterized one by one in order of occurrence in the text, by the following features: node(s) of attachment, feat</context>

(3.b) I would be so grateful if you could tell me the name of it, because it looks so unusual. Despite the utility of this distinction, we have not included source of coherence as a basic feature of meaning because it is beyond our NLP capabilities to distinguish pragmatic and semantic relations. Indeed, these relations tend to be signalled by the same shallow cues; for example, most causal discourse markers can be used for marking semantic or pragmatic relations indistinctively. Finally, structural features are not equivalent to SDRT coordinating and subordinating (Asher and Vieu, 2001) or to RST nuclearity. Indeed, asymmetric does not always imply subordinating or satellite; as in example (2.a), where the underlined segment holds an asymmetric relation with its matrix clause but is not discursively subordinated. In our annotation schema, discursive subordination is obtained compositionally; typically, a subordinating relation is an asymmetric relation of elaboration. For some representation purposes, interactions with some matter meaning may determine whether such a relation is considered subordinating or not; for example, it can be stipulated that causal relations are neve</context>

Unlike Carlson and Marcu (2001), we consider clausal subjects and objects of verbs and collocations of saying and opinion as discourse segments. It has been shown that their status in discourse is equal to that of a stand-alone segment (Verhagen, 2001), while their matrix clause performs a function comparable to that of lexical discourse markers.

We believe the distinction between volitional and non-volitional relations (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is not useful for information condensation. Other distinctions within the family of causal relations can be obtained by combination of the proposed features. For example, purpose can be expressed as asymmetric+progression+ cause, consequence as symmetric+progression+cause, and reason as asymmetric + elaboration + cause. In contrast, the distinction between semantic and pragmatic source of coherence (Sweetser, 1990; Sanders et al., 1992; Knott, 1996) makes useful distinctions to preserve coherence when texts are condensated. In a semantic relation, like that in (3.a), both related segments contribute to the full understanding of the described situation. In contrast, a segment related to another by a pragmatic relation, as the underlined segment in example (3.b), does not contribute to describe the situation, but elicits a relation between the illucotionary forces of the relad segments. Therefore, if the target is to produce a semantically coherent text, a pragmatic relation is useful to identify accessory segments, while it will signal re</context>

However, this kind of information comes short to resolve ambiguities at higher levels. A feature-based annotation schema seems to be descriptively more adequate than relationbased approaches, like those based in the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988). In these approaches, relations between discourse units are described by assigning them an atomic label. However, discourse relations can convey various kinds of meaning simultaneously (Moore and Pollack, 1992), which atomic labels fail to distinguish.

Unlike Carlson and Marcu (2001), we consider clausal subjects and objects of verbs and collocations of saying and opinion as discourse segments. It has been shown that their status in discourse is equal to that of a stand-alone segment (Verhagen, 2001), while their matrix clause performs a function comparable to that of lexical discourse markers. In the following example, the construction with a verb of opinion (2.a), conveys the same discursive meaning as the one with a discourse marker (2.b). feature discursive effect dimension context provides the setting for a discourse entity matter People started demonstrating as soon as the war began. parallelism establishes an equivalence between two elements A is (mod) B matter Some other governments supported the war, as in Spain. causality elicits a causal relation between two elements matter The</context>

For example, discourse markers are very informative of matter and structural dimensions, but most of them do not convey strong argumentative information. Consequently, relations between segments marked by a discourse marker may obtain their argumentative information from the topical or intentional structures of text, or from the syntactical structures of the utterance, while the rest of features can be determined by the discourse marker. If a single dimension of discourse is considered, the example in Figure 2 can only be adequately described by a DAG. Webber et al. (2003) avoid to treat this kind of cases as a DAG by exploiting the anaphoric properties of averbial discourse markers like then, as shown in the left of Figure 2. We explain it by resorting to different dimensions of discursive meaning, as seen in the example in the right, where solid lines represent the matter dimension, dashed lines represent the argumentative dimension and the structural dimension is represented by the relative level of terminal discourse units. 4 Annotation of Spanish text We have applied the presented framework to the annotation of a small journalistic corpus in Spanish.
