<bodyText confidence="0.9997688125">
Standard techniques used in multilingual
terminology management fail to describe
legal terminologies as they are bound to
different legal systems and terms do not
share a common meaning. In the LexALP
project, we use a technique defined for
general lexical databases to achieve cross
language interoperability between lan-
guages of the Alpine Convention. In this
paper we present the methodology and
tools developed for the collection, de-
scription and harmonisation of the legal
terminology of spatial planning and sus-
tainable development in the four lan-
guages of the countries of the Alpine
Space.

<bodyText confidence="0.999944117647059">
The aim of the LexALP project is to harmo-
nise the terminology used by the Alpine Conven-
tion, both for internal purposes and for commu-
nication among the member states. The Alpine
Convention is an international treaty signed by
all states of the Alpine territory (France, Monaco,
Switzerland Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany,
Italy and Slovenia) for the protection of land-
scape and sustainable development of this moun-
tain area1. The member states speak four differ-
ent languages, namely French, German, Italian,
and Slovene and have different legal systems and
traditions.
Hence arises the need for a systematization
and uniformation of terminology and clear trans-
lation equivalence in all four languages. For this
reason, the project intends to provide all

stakeholders and the wider public with an infor-
mation system which combines three main com-
ponents, a terminology data base, a multilingual
corpus and the relative bibliographic data base.
In this way the manually revised, elaborated and
validated (harmonised) quadrilingual information
on the legal terminology (i.e. complete termino-
logical entries) will be closely interacting with a
facility to dynamically search for additional con-
texts in a relevant set of legal texts in all lan-
guages and for all main legal systems involved.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991952173913">
The information system for the terminology
of the Alpine Convention, with a specific focus
on spatial planning and sustainable development,
will give the possibility to search for relevant
terms and their (harmonised or rejected)
translations in all 4 official languages of the
Alpine Convention in the first module, the term
bank. Next to retrieving synonyms and
translation equivalents within each legal system,
the user will be provided with a representative
context and a valid definition of the concept
under consideration. Source information will be
provided for each text field in the terminological
entry.
Via a link from the terminological data base
to the second module, the corpus facility, the
information system will give the possibility to
search the corpus for further contexts.
Finally, both term bank and corpus will be in-
teracting with a third module, the bibliographic
database, so as to allow retrieving full informa-
tion on text excepts cited in the term bank and to
store important meta data on corpus documents.

3.1 Data categories and motivations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99980768">
The data categories present in the terminology
database allow entering and organising relevant
information on the concept under analysis. The
term bank interface allows entering of the fol-
lowing terminological data categories: denomi-
nation/term, definition, context, note, sources
(text fields), grammatical information to the term,
harmonisation status, processing status, geo-
graphical usage, frequency and domain, accord-
ing to the appositely elaborated domain classifi-
cation structure2 (pull down menus). Again by
means of pull-down menus the terminologist will
be able to signal to the users which terms are al-
ready processed (i.e. checked by legal experts),
harmonised or rejected and - most important - to
which legal system they belong (the menu geo-
graphical usage allows to specify this informa-
tion). Furthermore it is possible to specify syno-
nyms, short forms, abbreviations etc. in the ter-
minological entry and, if necessary, link them to
the relative full information already present in
the term bank (however, no direct access to these
linked data is possible, this must be done via the
search interface). Finally, the terminologist is
given the possibility of writing general com-
ments to the entry. At the very end of one lan-
guage entry the terminologist can decide whether
to release the data to the public (by clicking on
the button ‘finish’) or keep it for further fine-
tuning (button ‘update’).
Each term is created in its ‘language volume’
and described by means of all necessary informa-
tion. As soon as one or all equivalents in the
other languages are available too, the single en-
tries can be linked to each other with the help of
an axie (see detailed description below).
Searches can be done for all languages or on a
user-defined selection of source and target lan-
guages. Presently the database allows global
searching in all text fields and filtering by source,
author, date of creation, as well as by axie name
and ids. Results can be displayed in full form, as
a short list of terms only or in XML. Some ex-
port/import functions are granted.
As the term bank serves mainly the scope of
diffusing harmonised terminology, the four trans-
lation equivalents (validated by a group of ex-
perts) are displayed together, whereas rejected
synonyms are displayed separately for each
search language. In this way the user may well

look for a non validated synonym and find it in
the database but be warned as to which is the
preferred term and its harmonised equivalents in
the other languages. Figure 1 shows such a situa-
tion where the French rejected term “transport

“trafic intra-alpin”.

Figure 2 shows the XML structure of the
French term “trafic intra-alpin”, as defined in the
Alpine Convention. The term entry is associated
to a unique identifier used to establish relations
between volume entries.
The example term belongs to the Alpine Con-

bears the information on its status (harmonised
or rejected) and its processing status (to be proc-
essed, provisionally processed or finalised).
In addition, a definition (along with its source)
and a context may be given. The definition and
context should be extracted from a legal text,
which must be identified in the source field.

3.3 Achieving language/legal system
interoperability
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99971305882353">
As the project deals with several different le-
gal terms, standard techniques used in multilin-
gual terminology management need to be
adapted to the peculiarities of the specialised
language of the law. Indeed, terms in different
languages are (generally) defined according to
different legal systems and these legal systems
cannot be changed. Hence, it is not possible to
define a common ’meaning’ that could be used
as a pivot for language interoperability5. In this
respect, legal terminology is closer to general
lexicography than to standard terminology.
In order to achieve language/legal system
interoperability we had several options that are
used in general lexicography.
Using a set of bilingual dictionaries is not an
option here, as we have to deal with at least 16

<listItem confidence="0.6824156">
3 Variants, acronyms, etc. are not considered as dif-
ferent denominations.

constitute a legal system per se.

Italian and the Austrian concepts of journalists’ pro-
fessional confidentiality. Whereas the Redaktionsge-
heimnis explicitly underlines that the journalist can
refuse to witness in court in order to keep the profes-
sional secret, in Italy the segreto giornalistico must
obligatorily be lifted on a judge’s request. The two
concepts have overlapping meanings in the two states,
however, they diverge greatly with respect to the be-
haviour in court.
language/legal system couples (with alpine Con-
vention and EU levels, but without taking into
account regional levels). Moreover, such a solu-
tion will not reflect the multilingual aspect of the
Alpine Convention or the Swiss legal system.
Finally, building bilingual volumes between the
French and Italian legal systems is far beyond the
objectives of the LexALP project.
Another solution would be to use an “Eu-
rowordnet like” approach (Vossen, 1998) where
a specific language/legal system is used as a
pivot and elements of the other systems are
linked by equivalent or near-equivalent links. As
such an approach artificially puts a language in
the pivot position, it generally leads to an “eth-
nocentric” view of the other languages. The ad-
vantage being that the architecture uses the bilin-
gual competence of lexicographers to achieve
multilingualism.
In this project, we chose to use ‘interlingual
acceptions’ (a.k.a. axies) as defined in (S6rasset,
1994) to represent such complex contrastive
phenomena as generally described in general
lexicography work. In this approach, each ‘term
meaning’ is associated to an interlingual accep-
tion (or axie). These axies are used to achieve
interoperability as a pivot linking terms of differ-
ent languages bearing the same meaning.
However, as we are dealing with legal terms
(bound to different legal systems), it is generally
not possible to find terms in different languages
that bear the same meaning. In fact such terms
can only be found in the Alpine Convention
(which is considered as a legal system expressed
in all the considered languages). Hence, we use
these terms to achieve interoperability between
languages. In this aspect, we are close to Eu-
rowordnet’s approach as we use a specific legal
system as a pivot, but in our case the pivot itself
is generally a quadrilingual set of entries.
These harmonised Alpine Convention terms
are linked through an interlingual acception. An
axie is a place holder for relations. Each interlin-
gual acception may be linked to several term en-
tries in the languages volumes through termref
elements and to other interlingual acceptions
through axieref elements, as illustrated in

official journal (date, number, page), É The bib-
liographical information of all documents is
stored in a database and can at any time be con-
sulted by the user.
The subfields have been elaborated and se-
lected by a team of legal experts, taking into ac-
count the classification specificities followed by
the Alpine Convention and the need to classify
texts from several different legal systems accord-
ing to one common structure. For this reason, the
legal experts have subdivided the fields spatial
planning and sustainable development into 5
main areas, in accordance with the Alpine Con-
vention Protocol dealing with these subjects and
subsequently adopted an EU-based model for
further subdividing the 5 main topics in such a
way that all countries involved could classify
their selected documents under a maximum of 3
main items, the first of which must be indicated
obligatorily. This classification allows an easy
selection of all subsets of documents according

inserted and, in case of multilingual documents,
alignment is done at sentence level.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999464">
4.3 Technical organization of corpus data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993931707317">
Following the bistro approach as realized for
the Corpus Ladin dl’Eurac (CLE) (Streiter et al.
2004) the corpus data is stored in a relational
database (PostgreSQL). The information present
in the XML-annotated documents is distributed
among four main tables: document_info, cor-
pus_words, corpus_structure, corpus_alignment.
The four tables can be described as follows:
document—info: This table holds the meta-
information about the documents; each category
(like full title, short title, abbreviation, legal sys-
tem, language, etc.) is represented by a separate
column. For each legal document one entry (one
row) with unique identification number is added
to the table. These identification numbers are
cited in the XML-header of the corpus docu-
ments.
corpus—words: This table holds the actual
text of the collected documents. Instead of stor-
ing entire paragraphs as it was done during the
creation of CLE, for this corpus a different ap-
proach is being tested. Every annotated text is
split into an indexed sequence of words, starting
with counter one. Once inserted into the database
a text is stored as a set of tuples composed of
word, position in text and document id (as a ref-
erence to the document information).
corpus—structure: This table holds all infor-
mation about the internal structure of the docu-
ments. Titles, sentences, paragraphs etc. are
stored by indicating starting and ending point of
the section. For each segment a tuple of segment
type, segment id, starting point (indicated by the
index of the first word), ending point (indicated
by the index of the last word) and document id is
added.
corpus—alignment: This table defines the
alignment of multilingual documents. By provid-
ing one column for each language the texts are
aligned via the document ids or via the ids of
single segments.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995084">
29
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999737333333333">
The tables are interconnected by explicitly
stated references. That means that the columns of
one table refer to the values of a certain column
of another table. As shown in figure 8 all tables
hold a column document_id that refers to the
document id of the table document_info. Fur-
thermore, the table corpus_structure holds refer-
ences to the column position of the table cor-
pus_words.

5 Searching the corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905">
Due to the fine-grained classification (see section
4.1) and the structural mark-up (see section 4.2)
of all corpus documents, corpus searches can be
restricted in the following ways:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.944483083333333">
• by specifying a subset of corpus docu-
ments over which the search should be
carried out (e.g. all documents of legal
system CH with language French);
• by choosing the type of unit to be dis-
played (whole paragraphs &lt;p&gt;, sentences
&lt;s&gt;, titles &lt;title&gt;, É);
• by searching for whole words only (ex-
act match) or parts of words (fuzzy
match);
• by restricting the number of hits to be
displayed at a time.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999647666666666">
For searches in multilingual documents it will be
possible to search for aligned segments, specify-
ing search word as well as target translation. For
example, the user could search for all alignments
of German-Italian sentences that contain the

<bodyText confidence="0.999890666666667">
Term bank and corpus are independent compo-
nents which together form the LexALP Informa-
tion System.
The interaction between corpus and term bank
will concern in particular 1) corpus segments
used as contexts and definitions in the termino-
logical entries, 2) short source references in the
term bank (and the associated sets of biblio-
graphical information) and 3) legal terms.

6.1 Entering data into term bank
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999978">
When adding citations to a term bank entry, the
relative bibliographic information will automati-
cally be counterchecked with the contents of the
bibliographical database. In case the information
about the cited document is already present in the
DB, a link to the term bank can be added. Oth-
erwise the terminologist is asked to provide all
information about the new source to the biblio-
graphic database and later create the link.
Next to static contexts and definitions present
for each terminological entry, each entry will
show a button for the dynamic creation of con-
texts. Hitting the button will start a context
search in the corpus and return all sentences con-
taining the term under consideration.

6.2 Searching the corpus

When searching the corpus the user will have the
opportunity to highlight terms present in the term

terms can be brought out. Via a link it will then

In general each corpus segment is linked to the
full set of bibliographic information of the
document that the segment is part of. Accessing
the source information will lead the user to a de-
tailed overview as shown in figure 4.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976315789474">
In this paper, we have presented the LexALP
information system, used to collect, describe and
harmonise the terminology used by the Alpine
Convention and to link it with national legal ter-
minology of the alpine Convention’s member
states. Even if we currently give a specific focus
on spatial planning and sustainable development,
the project is not restricted to these fields and the
methodology and tools developed can be adapted
to legal terminology of other fields.
In this paper we also proposed a solution to
the encoding of multilingual legal terminologies
in a context where standard techniques used in
multilingual terminology management usually
fail.
The terminology developed and the corpus
used for its development will be accessible on-
line for the stakeholders and the wider public
through the LexALP information system.

<abstract confidence="0.982516058823529">Standard techniques used in multilingual terminology management fail to describe legal terminologies as they are bound to different legal systems and terms do not share a common meaning. In the LexALP project, we use a technique defined for general lexical databases to achieve cross language interoperability between languages of the Alpine Convention. In this paper we present the methodology and tools developed for the collection, description and harmonisation of the legal terminology of spatial planning and sustainable development in the four languages of the countries of the Alpine Space.</abstract>

Furthermore, a link to the classification data (bibliographic data base) is inserted and, in case of multilingual documents, alignment is done at sentence level. The XML-annotated documents hold all the information needed for the insertion into the corpus database, such as structural mark-up and bibliographical information. The full text documents are transformed into sets of database entries, which can be imported into the database. 4.3 Technical organization of corpus data Following the bistro approach as realized for the Corpus Ladin dl’Eurac (CLE) (Streiter et al. 2004) the corpus data is stored in a relational database (PostgreSQL). The information present in the XML-annotated documents is distributed among four main tables: document_info, corpus_words, corpus_structure, corpus_alignment. The four tables can be described as follows: document—info: This table holds the metainformation about the documents; each category (like full title, short title, abbreviation, legal system, language, etc.) is represented by a separate column. For each legal document one entry (one row) with unique identification number is added to the table. These identification numbers a</context>

The two concepts have overlapping meanings in the two states, however, they diverge greatly with respect to the behaviour in court. language/legal system couples (with alpine Convention and EU levels, but without taking into account regional levels). Moreover, such a solution will not reflect the multilingual aspect of the Alpine Convention or the Swiss legal system. Finally, building bilingual volumes between the French and Italian legal systems is far beyond the objectives of the LexALP project. Another solution would be to use an “Eurowordnet like” approach (Vossen, 1998) where a specific language/legal system is used as a pivot and elements of the other systems are linked by equivalent or near-equivalent links. As such an approach artificially puts a language in the pivot position, it generally leads to an “ethnocentric” view of the other languages. The advantage being that the architecture uses the bilingual competence of lexicographers to achieve multilingualism. In this project, we chose to use ‘interlingual acceptions’ (a.k.a. axies) as defined in (S6rasset, 1994) to represent such complex contrastive phenomena as generally described in general lexicograp</context>
