Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9993885">
Geo-referenced data which are often communicated via
maps are inaccessible to the visually impaired popula-
tion. We summarise existing approaches to improving
accessibility of geo-referenced data and present the At-
las.txt project which aims to produce textual summaries
of such data which can be read out via a screenreader.
We outline issues involved in generating descriptions of
geo-referenced data and present initial work on content
determination based on knowledge acquisition from both
parallel corpus analysis and input from visually impaired
people. In our corpus analysis we build an ontology
containing abstract representations of expert-written sen-
tences which we associate with macros containing se-
quences of data analysis methods. This helps us to iden-
tify which data analysis methods need to be applied to
generate text from data.

<bodyText confidence="0.999509769230769">
Currently there is a plethora of geo-referenced sta-
tistical data such as census data publicly accessible
on the World Wide Web. Much of this data is pro-
vided by governmental organisations like National
Statistics which provides the UK census 2001 data
online1. Such organisations are legally required to
make this data accessible to user groups with visual
impairments. However the majority of this data is
currently displayed in the form of chloropleth maps
which shade regions according to the mean value of
a given variable in that region, as is typically exem-
plified in Figure 12 and is described by the expert
authored text:

close to 2 million people live in large urban areas”.
Such maps of geo-referenced data aid sighted users
to quickly comprehend spatial patterns and trends,
e.g., that the Scottish population is largely concen-
trated among the urban areas in Figure 1. How-
ever, visually impaired users have to listen to each
of the individual frequency values corresponding to
the census area units before comprehending the spa-
tial distribution of population. The Atlas.txt project
aims to improve access to such geo-referenced data
using NLG technology by determining the salient
features which best explain the data and communi-
cating this relevant information as text summaries
like the one above, which can then be read out via
a screen-reader. The project initially addresses pre-
dominantly census data, but aims to develop tech-
niques that can be applied on other geo-referenced
data such as land-use data.

tion in graphs and enables user querying. SumTime
(Sripada et al, 2003) summarises time-series data.
While there is no prior work on generating textual
descriptions of geo-referenced data, there have been
studies on describing spatial data in the context of
route directions ((Geldof, 2003); (Marciniak and
Strube, 2004)), scene descriptions (Novak, 1986),
geometric descriptions (Mitkov, 1990) and spatial
descriptions (Ebert et al, 1996). RoadSafe3, which
generates weather forecast texts for road mainte-
nance based on spatio-temporal weather prediction
data, also explores similar issues. However, in the
Atlas.txt project our main focus is on describing
geo-spatial data to visually impaired users.
Other projects address the issue of accessibility
with other user interaction paradigms in mind, for
example haptic interfaces and non-speech sonic in-
terfaces. Of these, the most closely related are soni-
fication (non-speech audio) approaches to data com-
munication. (Stockman, 2004) discusses issues in-
volved with sonification of spreadsheet data. Of
particular interest is the iSonic (Zhao, 2005) data
exploration tool which uses sonification techniques
to aid interactive exploration of geo-referenced data
displayed as chloropleth maps. Such approaches
can be seen as complementary to our approach.

In order to elicit end-user requirements and coor-
dinate evaluation subjects, we interviewed a visu-
ally impaired volunteer at the Grampian Society for
the Blind4 (GSB) who is responsible for helping
blind users with computer accessibility. He demon-
strated how he and other blind users he knows cur-
rently explore data; if the data is in tabular form,
they use spreadsheet applications which compute
descriptive statistics such as the mean and range
of a column (row) and use these statistics to grad-
ually build a mental picture of the distribution of
the data. Analysing geo-referenced data addition-
ally needs to be associated with corresponding geo-
graphical areas. Textual descriptions, he felt, would
certainly help visually impaired users to quickly
gain an overview of the underlying data provided
they present the same information a sighted person
extracts from a visual representation of the data.

to understand how humans perform this activity.
There is a huge amount of geo-referenced data on-
line, and we start by considering a few such ex-
pert (i.e., statistician) written texts and their corre-
sponding data, which can be found online via organ-
isations like National Statistics. Using such paral-
lel data and text corpora for knowledge acquisition
(KA) is a fairly common approach (Sripada et al,
2003). An example from Lambeth Council’s web-
site of the sort of texts we are looking at follows be-
low, and the corresponding data appears in Table 1.
Such pairings of sentences and tables containing the
data communicated in the sentences form our grow-
ing corpus. The corpus collection is in an initial
stage, and we currently have about 300 such pairs
of sentences and data tables gleaned from a handful
of online documents.

(1) Example 1: People from Non-white ethnic
groups constituted 30.3 % of Lambeth’s
population in 1991, compared with 6.1% of the
country as a whole.
(2) Example 2: Black African residents have
increased in Lambeth by 5.1%. This is also
reflected London wide and nationally.

<bodyText confidence="0.999985074074074">
We distinguish content depending on whether it
classifies strictly spatial data (e.g., the first sentence
in Ex. 2), compares areas (e.g., the second sentence
in Ex. 2 and the last phrase in Ex. 1), or com-
pares spatial data across different times. Another
way we can distinguish message content has to do
with whether messages describe factual information
or communicate inferences. Following (Law et al,
2005), we distinguish between descriptive messages
which are based on data analysis and factual fea-
tures of the data, and interpretative messages which
involve expert knowledge about the domain, which
can include everything from inferences on the data
to the communication of specific domain knowl-
edge. The interpretative features which arise gener-
ally involve inferences drawn by the experts about
the data, e.g., explanations, cause-effect, etc. Al-
though performing these sorts of inferences is cur-
rently beyond the project’s scope, our initial studies
show a predominance of descriptive messages like
those in Ex. 1 and 2, which seems to indicate that
addressing these sorts of messages will enable us to
address a decent proportion of the sorts of messages
we want to communicate. Another point to bear in
mind is that the documents we’re webscraping are
designed for sighted users, which means that one
cannot assume that the modalities of text and data

contain the same information. However, although
the two modes often contain complementary infor-
mation, informal analysis indicates that official re-
porting of geo-referenced data often contains both
maps and text to communicate important informa-
tion, making webscraping fairly viable for corpus
collection.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999727">
3.2 Corpus Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99826179245283">
We index data tables like the one shown in Table 1
to the corresponding texts which describe them in
a database, thereby linking information in different
modalities and forming a parallel corpus. Essen-
tially the core of KA from corpus analysis lies in
the mapping from a (manually interpreted) abstract
representation (AR) of an expert textual description
or message (Reiter and Dale, 2000) to an AR of
the data, as is shown in Figure 3. Note that the
textual analysis takes place on the sentential level
currently; we leave higher-level discourse structure
for future work. Abstract representations of data
(ADR) contain the results of applying data analysis
methods (which can range from simple descriptive
statistics to spatial data mining methods) on the raw
data found in tables in the documents.
AR of textual descriptions proceeds in several
steps. We started building up an ontology of
spatial relations by labelling texts at the senten-
tial level according to the messages communicated;
these message labels abstract over texts and in-
dicate the primary spatial relation communicated,
e.g., category : location − density, which for ex-
ample labels the text: “The Black Caribbean com-
munity is concentrated in the wards around Brix-
ton”. Here category is a higher level class in
the ontology corresponding to messages communi-
cating information to do with a category of data,
in this case the Black Caribbean population, and
location − density indicates the particular feature
(location) and property of this feature (density)
under discussion. Message labels indicate infor-
mation content. We indicate sentential rhetori-
cal/discourse content via a set of around ten mes-
sage predicates adopted from McKeown’s message
predicates (McKeown, 1985) and RST (Mann and
Thompson, 1988). These message predicates com-
municate contrast, causality, etc. Message predi-
cates and message labels constitute the highest level
of abstraction at the sentential level in our ATR.
At a lower level we create ARs for the mes-
sages which can be seen as an intermediary level
of abstraction between message labels and predi-
cates and the texts themselves and correlate roughly
to cue-phrases. We find all cue-phrases which in-
dicate spatial relations in the corpora, e.g., “con-
stituted”, “concentrated”, to get a range of the
sorts of contexts these cues can appear in and
then abstract over the cues, forming mostly syn-
onymous classes of cues which can be associated
with the same message labels and predicates. The
text above has as its message content, the frame
concentrated[Group, Location].

3.2.1 Initial Methodology and Findings
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999915">
We map from ATRs to ADRs by (manually) asso-
ciating simple sequences of data analysis methods
(which we term macros) with ATRs, so the previ-
ous text’s ATR is associated with the method spatial
segmentation. The text “A higher number of Black
African people live in the north of the borough than
in the south” would be associated with first spatial
segmentation (Haining, 2003), and then, given that
the distribution is not uniform, summation of the
population values for the category in geographic re-
gions with different frequencies.
The macros serve as an initial indication of which
data analysis methods we should apply to the data
and in which order so that we can generate the kinds
of texts produced by the experts. We expect that
the findings from data analysis will mostly lie at the
sentential level, e.g., descriptive statistical informa-
tion, or information from spatial segmentation. The
idea is that these mappings between data and text
can be used as a backbone for describing new data
sets which share similar findings from spatial data
analysis.
From an initial analysis of 70 texts, we found that
spatial segmentation was the most common method
invoked, occurring 17% of the time, followed by
comparisons of values, which occurred 14% of the
time. We found that 13% of the texts involved a
sequence of data analysis methods, e.g., segmenta-

tion followed by breakdown analysis, and another
13% invoked multiple (non-sequential) data analy-
sis methods like reporting the minimum and maxi-
mum values. This leaves the majority (74%) as sim-
ply invoking a single data analysis method. Ignor-
ing whether methods are invoked sequentially or in
multiples, we found that the largest number of meth-
ods invoked involve simply giving significant val-
ues, ranking values, summing them or comparing
them. However the extent to which these findings
(as opposed to others arising from the same data)
are significant needs to be resolved so that given a
data set, we can determine which findings are “in-
teresting”.

4 Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927071428571">
This paper describes work in progress on the At-
las.txt project, which just started in January 2007.
As such, our goal here is to introduce the project
and initial KA work in the hopes that we will re-
ceive useful feedback about our initial methodology
which will then guide future work. In this paper
we have presented initial ideas about mapping geo-
spatial data to text via the data analysis macros nec-
essary for communicating the corresponding texts
with the goal of driving generation of similar sen-
tences for unseen data. We still need to account
for discourse level structuring of these messages.
We have implemented our ATR in the SimpleNLG
framework and toolkit5, enabling us to generate text
from ATRs. However much work still needs to be
done toward implementing the data to ADR and
ADR to ATR stages.
An immediate area of future work involves
analysing more corpora in order to expand our set of
data analysis macros. We also need to specifically
investigate the extent to which the data analysis
macros we associate with ATRs actually do produce
the information communicated in the texts. Addi-
tionally we need a better understanding of the in-
formational requirements of visually-impaired end-
users, and the extent to which results from a survey
we are currently running including “think aloud”
descriptions of census data from sighted users needs

The text “A higher number of Black African people live in the north of the borough than in the south” would be associated with first spatial segmentation (Haining, 2003), and then, given that the distribution is not uniform, summation of the population values for the category in geographic regions with different frequencies. The macros serve as an initial indication of which data analysis methods we should apply to the data and in which order so that we can generate the kinds of texts produced by the experts. We expect that the findings from data analysis will mostly lie at the sentential level, e.g., descriptive statistical information, or information from spatial segmentation. The idea is that these mappings between data and text can be used as a backbone f</context>

We distinguish content depending on whether it classifies strictly spatial data (e.g., the first sentence in Ex. 2), compares areas (e.g., the second sentence in Ex. 2 and the last phrase in Ex. 1), or compares spatial data across different times. Another way we can distinguish message content has to do with whether messages describe factual information or communicate inferences. Following (Law et al, 2005), we distinguish between descriptive messages which are based on data analysis and factual features of the data, and interpretative messages which involve expert knowledge about the domain, which can include everything from inferences on the data to the communication of specific domain knowledge. The interpretative features which arise generally involve inferences drawn by the experts about the data, e.g., explanations, cause-effect, etc. Although performing these sorts of inferences is currently beyond the project’s scope, our initial studies show a predominance of descriptive messages like t</context>

Here category is a higher level class in the ontology corresponding to messages communicating information to do with a category of data, in this case the Black Caribbean population, and location − density indicates the particular feature (location) and property of this feature (density) under discussion. Message labels indicate information content. We indicate sentential rhetorical/discourse content via a set of around ten message predicates adopted from McKeown’s message predicates (McKeown, 1985) and RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988). These message predicates communicate contrast, causality, etc. Message predicates and message labels constitute the highest level of abstraction at the sentential level in our ATR. At a lower level we create ARs for the messages which can be seen as an intermediary level of abstraction between message labels and predicates and the texts themselves and correlate roughly to cue-phrases. We find all cue-phrases which indicate spatial relations in the corpora, e.g., “constituted”, “concentrated”, to get a range of the sorts of contexts these cues can appear in and then abstract over the cues, fo</context>

Essentially the core of KA from corpus analysis lies in the mapping from a (manually interpreted) abstract representation (AR) of an expert textual description or message (Reiter and Dale, 2000) to an AR of the data, as is shown in Figure 3. Note that the textual analysis takes place on the sentential level currently; we leave higher-level discourse structure for future work. Abstract representations of data (ADR) contain the results of applying data analysis methods (which can range from simple descriptive statistics to spatial data mining methods) on the raw data found in tables in the documents. AR of textual descriptions proceeds in several steps. We started building up an ontology of spatial relations by labelling texts at the sentential level according to the messages communica</context>

There is a huge amount of geo-referenced data online, and we start by considering a few such expert (i.e., statistician) written texts and their corresponding data, which can be found online via organisations like National Statistics. Using such parallel data and text corpora for knowledge acquisition (KA) is a fairly common approach (Sripada et al, 2003). An example from Lambeth Council’s website of the sort of texts we are looking at follows below, and the corresponding data appears in Table 1. Such pairings of sentences and tables containing the data communicated in the sentences form our growing corpus. The corpus collection is in an initial stage, and we currently have about 300 such pairs of sentences and data tables gleaned from a handful of online documents.
