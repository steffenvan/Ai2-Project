in Natural Language Processing.

<bodyText confidence="0.99908165">
The notion that a single grammar could be used in natural language analysis and
generation is by no means a surprising one. Intuitively we feel that it should be possible
to propose a set of rules and/or principles which would define the class of well-formed
expressions of a given language independently of any particular task. Despite the variety
of linguistic theories available today this result remained elusive, until recently. In the
past few years, however, there has been an increasing interest in reversible grammar
research, and some significant new results have emerged. This workshop is the first
international meeting entirely devoted to the problems of reversible grammar in natural
language processing as seen from various viewpoints: theoretical linguistics, computa-
tional linguistics and computer science.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all these authors who submitted papers
of such high quality, for it is they who have made this meeting possible. I am of course
especially grateful to the Program Committee, Marc Dymetman, Patrick Saint-Dizier and
Gertjan van Noord, for their careful reviewing of the papers, and their invaluable help in
organizing this workshop. We are also particularly indebted to Martin Kay, the keynote
speaker, for adding a special sparkle to our meeting.
This meeting of course would not be possible without generous help from the Asso-
ciation for Computational Linguistics, particularly Don Walker, Peter Norvig and Ralph
Grishman. The workshop has been sponsored by the Special Interest Groups on Genera-
tion (SIGGEN) and Parsing (SIGPARSE), and my special thanks go to Karen Kukich,
