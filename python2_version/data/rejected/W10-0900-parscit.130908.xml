<bodyText confidence="0.957452347826087">
It has been a long term vision of Artificial Intelligence to develop Learning by Reading systems that can
capture knowledge from naturally occurring texts, convert it into a deep logical notation and perform
some inferences/reasoning on them. Such systems directly build on relatively mature areas of research,
including Information Extraction (for picking out relevant information from the text), Commonsense
and AI Reasoning (for deriving inferences from the knowledge acquired), Bootstrapped Learning (for
using the learned knowledge to expand the knowledge base) and Question Answering (for providing
evaluation mechanisms for Learning by Reading systems). In Natural Language Processing, statistical
learning techniques have provided new solutions and breakthroughs in various areas over the last
decade. In Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, systems have achieved impressive performance
and scale in far more complex problems than the past.
Learning by Reading is a two-part process. One part deals with extracting interesting information from
naturally occurring texts, and the other is to use this extracted knowledge to expand the knowledge
base and consequently the system’s inference capabilities. Previous systems have chosen either a
”broad and shallow” or a ”narrow and deep” knowledge acquisition and reasoning strategy. These
techniques are constrained by either their limited reasoning ability or their extreme domain dependence.
The goal of this workshop is to draw together researchers to explore the nature and degree of
integration possible between symbolic and statistical techniques for knowledge acquisition and
reasoning. In particular, given these developments, what is the role of commonsense knowledge and
reasoning in language understanding? What are the limitations of each style of processing, and how
can they be overcome by complementary strengths of the other? What are appropriate evaluation
metrics for Learning by Reading systems?
