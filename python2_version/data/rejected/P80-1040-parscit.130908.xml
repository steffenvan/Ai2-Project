Experiments were conducted on a book, Current Medical
Information and Terminology, (AMA, Chicago, 1971, edited
by Burgess Gordon, M.D.), which is a compendium of 3262
diseases, each of which is defined by a collection of
attributes. The original purpose of the book was to
introduce a standard nomenclature of disease names, and
the attributes are organized in conventional medical
form: a definition consists of a brief description of
the relevant symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, and
the like. Each disease is, in addition, assigned to one
(or at most two) of eleven disease categories which en-
umerate physiological systems (skin, respiratory, card-
iovascular, etc.). While the editorial style of the
book is highly telegraphic, with many attributes being
expressed as single words, it is nevertheless easily
readable (see Figure 1).
The vocabulary employed consists of about 19,000 distinct
&amp;quot;words&amp;quot; (determined by a lexical definition), roughly
divided equally between common English words and medical
terms. We measured word frequency by &amp;quot;disease occur-
rence&amp;quot;, (the number of disease definitions in which a
given word occurs one or more times). By this measure,
only seven words occurred in more than half the disease
definitions, and about 40% of the vocabulary occurred in
only a single disease definition. (Table 1 lists the
words at the top of the frequency list together with the
number of occurrences.)
Assisted by the facilities of the 17MUNIX operating sys-
tem, we created a series of inverted files (from a
magnetic tape of the CMIT text), and developed a set of
interactive programs to form a word-and-context query
system. This system has enabled us to study the problem
of inferring term reference in this large sample of text
(some 333,000 word occurrences), within the context of
diseases.
An interesting early result was the ease with which many
medical terms could be algorithmically separated from
common English words. After adjusting for the fact that
some disease categories are larger than others, we de-
fined an entropy-like measure of the distribution of
word occurrences over the eleven physiological categor-
ies as a measure of category specificity. We reasoned
that some medical terms such as &apos;murmur&apos;, while not
specific to any particular heart disease, are specific
to heart disease generally. This term would not, for
example, be used in describing endocrine disorders.
Such a word would be expected to occur in category 04
(Cardiovascular disease) frequently, and not in the
other categories. Such a term would, by our measure,
have a low &apos;entropy&apos;. A common English word like &apos;of&apos;,
would be used in the descriptions of all kinds of dis-
ease, and would accordingly have a high &apos;entropy&apos;.
Tables 2 and 3 show the top and bottom of the list of
all words occurring in two or more diseases sorted by
this entropy measure. In these lists, as our hypothesis
seems to imply, low &apos;entropy&apos; corresponds to high
&apos;specificity&apos;, and high &apos;entropy&apos; to low &apos;specificity&apos;.
This separation of medical terms from common English
words, by algorithmic means, is facilitated by the
context supplied by the notion of &apos;disease category&apos;,
and the fact that this was represented in the CMIT text.
This work was supported in part by grants from The
Commonwealth Fund, and from the National Library of
Medicine (1 K10 LM00014).

Our second experiment investigated the co-occurrence
properties of some medical terms. Aware that many medi-
cal diagnostic programs have assumed attribute independ-
ence, we sought to shed light on the appropriateness of
the assumption by evaluating it in terms of word co-
occurrence in disease definitions.
Since the previously described procedure had given us a
means of selecting medical terms from common English
words, it was possible to produce lists of &apos;pure&apos;
medical terms. We then wrote a program which formed all
pairs of such terms (ignoring order). We defined an
&apos;association measure&apos; (A) which measured the difference
between the observed co-occurrences of term-pairs (they
could co-occur in any location in the definition and in
either order), and the co-occurrences expected from
chance alone. Tables 4 and 5 show the top and bottom of
a list of all pairs formed from the low entropy terms in
the previous experiment. The first 1120 terms were
chosen, that is, those having an entropy of 2.0 napiers
ct less. The pair list was then sorted by this associa-
tion measure, A.
Word pairs which are found to be highly associated,
appear to do so for two reasons. The test, which is
trivial, is that some word pairs are semantically one
word despite their being lexically, two. Common
examples would be &apos;white House&apos; and &apos;Hong Kong&apos;; medical
examples are &apos;vital capacity&apos;, &apos;axis deviation&apos;, and
&apos;slit lamp&apos;. These could have been avoided algorithmic-
ally by not taking adjacent words in forming the term-
pairs, without any significant overall effect. The
second reasons for high frequency word co-occurrence is
that both words are causally related through underlying
physiological mechanisms. It is these which had the
greatest interest for us, and the measure A, may be
viewed as a measure of the non-independence of the symp-
toms or signs themselves.
The term pairs which are negatively associated, have
this property for the same reason. If the two terms are
used typically in the descriptions of different diseases,
they are less likely to co-occur than by chance. (In a
baseball story on the sports page, we would not find
&apos;Pass&apos;, &apos;punt&apos;, or &apos;tackle&apos;). These negatively assoc-
iated pairs may have value in diagnostic programs for
the recognition of two or more diseases in a given
patient, a problem not satisfactorily dealt with by even
the most sophisticated of current programs.
Finally, an extension of the entropy concept permits one
to generate (algorithmically) the vocabularies used by
the medical specialties (which correspond to the disease
categories represented in CMIT. This is done by assign-
ing terms which occur predominantly in one category to a
single vocabulary and then sorting by entropy. Tables 6
and 7 show the vocabularies used in dermatology and gas-
troenterology (as derived from CmIT). These vocabular-
ies, it will be noted, can be used as &apos;hit lists&apos; for
the purpose of recognizing the content of medical texts.
In summary, we see the ability to differentiate medical
terms from common words by context, and the ability to
relate the medical words by meaning, as two of the first
steps toward text processing algorithms that preserve
and can manipulate the semantic content of words in med-
ical texts.

<abstract confidence="0.968682409448819">were conducted on a book, Medical Informationand Terminology,(AMA, Chicago, 1971, edited by Burgess Gordon, M.D.), which is a compendium of 3262 diseases, each of which is defined by a collection of attributes. The original purpose of the book was to introduce a standard nomenclature of disease names, and the attributes are organized in conventional medical form: a definition consists of a brief description of the relevant symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, and the like. Each disease is, in addition, assigned to one (or at most two) of eleven disease categories which enumerate physiological systems (skin, respiratory, cardiovascular, etc.). While the editorial style of the book is highly telegraphic, with many attributes being expressed as single words, it is nevertheless easily readable (see Figure 1). The vocabulary employed consists of about 19,000 distinct &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; (determined by a lexical definition), roughly divided equally between common English words and medical terms. We measured word frequency by &amp;quot;disease occurrence&amp;quot;, (the number of disease definitions in which a given word occurs one or more times). By this measure, only seven words occurred in more than half the disease definitions, and about 40% of the vocabulary occurred in only a single disease definition. (Table 1 lists the words at the top of the frequency list together with the number of occurrences.) by the facilities of the operating system, we created a series of inverted files (from a magnetic tape of the CMIT text), and developed a set of interactive programs to form a word-and-context query system. This system has enabled us to study the problem of inferring term reference in this large sample of text (some 333,000 word occurrences), within the context of diseases. An interesting early result was the ease with which many medical terms could be algorithmically separated from common English words. After adjusting for the fact that some disease categories are larger than others, we defined an entropy-like measure of the distribution of word occurrences over the eleven physiological categories as a measure of category specificity. We reasoned some medical terms such as &apos;murmur&apos;, specific to any particular heart disease, are specific to heart disease generally. This term would not, for example, be used in describing endocrine disorders. Such a word would be expected to occur in category 04 (Cardiovascular disease) frequently, and not in the other categories. Such a term would, by our measure, have a low &apos;entropy&apos;. A common English word like &apos;of&apos;, would be used in the descriptions of all kinds of disease, and would accordingly have a high &apos;entropy&apos;. Tables 2 and 3 show the top and bottom of the list of all words occurring in two or more diseases sorted by this entropy measure. In these lists, as our hypothesis seems to imply, low &apos;entropy&apos; corresponds to high &apos;specificity&apos;, and high &apos;entropy&apos; to low &apos;specificity&apos;. This separation of medical terms from common English words, by algorithmic means, is facilitated by the context supplied by the notion of &apos;disease category&apos;, and the fact that this was represented in the CMIT text. This work was supported in part by grants from The Commonwealth Fund, and from the National Library of Medicine (1 K10 LM00014). is a trademark of Bell Laboratories. Our second experiment investigated the co-occurrence of some medical terms. Aware that mediprograms have assumed attribute independence, we sought to shed light on the appropriateness of the assumption by evaluating it in terms of word cooccurrence in disease definitions. Since the previously described procedure had given us a means of selecting medical terms from common English words, it was possible to produce lists of &apos;pure&apos; medical terms. We then wrote a program which formed all pairs of such terms (ignoring order). We defined an &apos;association measure&apos; (A) which measured the difference between the observed co-occurrences of term-pairs (they could co-occur in any location in the definition and in either order), and the co-occurrences expected from chance alone. Tables 4 and 5 show the top and bottom of a list of all pairs formed from the low entropy terms in the previous experiment. The first 1120 terms were chosen, that is, those having an entropy of 2.0 napiers The pair list was then sorted by this association measure, A. pairs which to be highly associated, appear to do so for two reasons. The test, which is trivial, is that some word pairs are semantically one word despite their being lexically, two. Common would be and &apos;Hong Kong&apos;; medical examples are &apos;vital capacity&apos;, &apos;axis deviation&apos;, and &apos;slit lamp&apos;. These could have been avoided algorithmically by not taking adjacent words in forming the termpairs, without any significant overall effect. The second reasons for high frequency word co-occurrence is that both words are causally related through underlying physiological mechanisms. It is these which had the greatest interest for us, and the measure A, may be viewed as a measure of the non-independence of the symptoms or signs themselves. The term pairs which are negatively associated, have this property for the same reason. If the two terms are used typically in the descriptions of different diseases, they are less likely to co-occur than by chance. (In a baseball story on the sports page, we would not find &apos;Pass&apos;, &apos;punt&apos;, or &apos;tackle&apos;). These negatively associated pairs may have value in diagnostic programs for the recognition of two or more diseases in a given patient, a problem not satisfactorily dealt with by even the most sophisticated of current programs. Finally, an extension of the entropy concept permits one to generate (algorithmically) the vocabularies used by the medical specialties (which correspond to the disease represented in CMIT. This is done by assignwhich occur predominantly in one category to a single vocabulary and then sorting by entropy. Tables 6 and 7 show the vocabularies used in dermatology and gastroenterology (as derived from CmIT). These vocabularies, it will be noted, can be used as &apos;hit lists&apos; for the purpose of recognizing the content of medical texts. In summary, we see the ability to differentiate medical terms from common words by context, and the ability to relate the medical words by meaning, as two of the first steps toward text processing algorithms that preserve and can manipulate the semantic content of words in medical texts.</abstract>
