<bodyText confidence="0.999983681818182">
The past five years have seen the emergence of robust, scalable natu-
ral language processing systems that can summarize and answer
questions about online material. One key to the success of such sys-
tems is that they re-use text that appeared in the documents rather
than generating new sentences from scratch. Re-using text is abso-
lutely essential for the development of robust systems; full semantic
interpretation of unrestricted text is beyond the state of the art. Better
summaries and answers can be produced, however, if systems can
generate new sentences from the input text, fusing relevant phrases
and discarding irrelevant ones. When the underlying sources for
summarization come from multiple languages, the need for text-to-
text generation is even more pronounced.
In this invited talk I present research on query-focused summariza-
tion over a variety of sources, including news, broadcast news, talks
shows and blogs. Our research combines approaches from summari-
zation and information extraction to answer open-ended questions.
Because our sources include informal genres as well as formal genres
and draw from English, Arabic and Chinese, text-to-text generation is
critical for improving the intelligibility of responses. In our systems,
we exploit information available at question answering time to edit
sentences, removing redundant and irrelevant information and cor-
recting errors in translated sentences.
