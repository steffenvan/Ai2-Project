<newSection> Abstract This paper presents an on-going effort which aims to annotate the Wall Street Journal sections of the Penn Treebank with the help of a hand-written large-scale and wide-coverage grammar of English.
In doing so, we are not only focusing on the various stages of the semi-automated annotation process we have adopted, but we are also showing that rich linguistic annotations, which can apart from syntax also incorporate semantics, ensure that the treebank is guaranteed to be a truly sharable, re-usable and multi-functional linguistic resourceâ€ .
