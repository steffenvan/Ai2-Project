<newSection> Abstract We report on an attempt to extend a reference generation system, originally designed only for main subjects, to generate references for multiple entities in a single document.
This endeavor yielded three separate systems: one utilizing the original classifier, another with a retrained classifier, and a third taking advantage of new data to improve the identification of interfering antecedents.
Each subsequent system improved upon the results of the previous iteration.
