<newSection> Abstract We describe on-going work in the development of a cross-language question-answering framework for the open domain.
An overview of the framework is being provided, some details on the important concepts of a flexible framework are presented and two cross-cutting aspects (cross-linguality and credibility) for question-answering systems are up for discussion.
