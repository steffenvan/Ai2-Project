<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our statistical machine translation systems based on the Moses toolkit for the WMT08 shared task.
We address the Europarl and News conditions for the following language pairs: English with French, German and Spanish.
For Europarl, n-best rescoring is performed using an enhanced n-gram or a neuronal language model; for the News condition, language models incorporate extra training data.
We also report unconvincing results of experiments with factored models.
