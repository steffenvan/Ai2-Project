<newSection> Abstract Multiword Expressions present a challenge for language technology, given their flexible nature.
Each type of multiword expression has its own characteristics, and providing a uniform lexical encoding for them is a difficult task to undertake.
Nonetheless, in this paper we present an architecture for the lexical encoding of these expressions in a database, that takes into account their flexibility.
This encoding extends in a straightforward manner the one required for simplex (single) words, and maximises the information contained for them in the description of multiwords.
