<newSection> Abstract The paper investigates discourse particles on the example of German doch, assigning to them very specific semantic interpretations that still cover a wide range of their uses.
The analysis highlights the role of discourse particles in managing the common ground and crucially takes into account that discourse particles can refer not only to utterances they are a part of and to previously uttered utterances, but also to felicity conditions of these utterances.
