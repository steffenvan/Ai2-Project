<newSection> Abstract The relation between vocabulary size (V(N)) and the text size (N) has been reexamined, where the text has been presented as binary sequence.
Six different texts by three authors from different periods were taken from the Corpus of Serbian Language to be analyzed.
Statistics included regression analysis, randomness test for binary sequence and stochastic models.
Point of equivalence, where number of new and old words is equal, has been proposed as characteristic constant of the text.
This constant is independent on N and could be used as an index of vocabulary richness.
Key-words: vocabulary size, text size, binary sequence, characteristic constant of the text.
