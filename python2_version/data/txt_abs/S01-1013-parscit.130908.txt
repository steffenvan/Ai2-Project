<newSection> Abstract This paper describes two distinct attempts at the SENSEVAL-2 Japanese translation task.
The first implementation is based on lexical similarity and builds on the results of Baldwin (2001b; 2001a), whereas the second is based on structural similarity via the medium of parse trees and includes a basic model of conceptual similarity.
Despite its simplistic nature, the lexical method was found to perform the better of the two, at 49.1% accuracy, as compared to 41.2% for the structural method and 36.8% for the baseline.
