<newSection> ABSTRACT This paper presents Trace & Unification Grammar (TUG), a declarative and reversible grammar formalism that brings together Unification Grammar (UG) and ideas of Government & Binding Theory (GB) in an undogmatic way.
A grammar compiler is presented that transforms a grammar written in the TUG formalism into two different forms, one being useful for parsing, the other being useful for generation.
