<newSection> Abstract Unsupervised learning of grammar is a problem that can be important in many areas ranging from text preprocessing for information retrieval and classification to machine translation.
We describe an MDL based grammar of a language that contains morphology and lexical categories.
We use an unsupervised learner of morphology to bootstrap the acquisition of lexical categories and use these two learning processes iteratively to help and constrain each other.
To be able to do so, we need to make our existing morphological analysis less fine grained.
We present an algorithm for collapsing morphological classes (signatures) by using syntactic context.
Our experiments demonstrate that this collapse preserves the relation between morphology and lexical categories within new signatures, and thereby minimizes the description length of the model.
