<newSection> Abstract A central issue for making the content of a scientific document quickly accessible to a potential reader is the extraction of keyphrases, which capture the main topic of the document.
Keyphrases can be extracted automatically by generating a list of keyphrase candidates, ranking these candidates, and selecting the top-ranked candidates as keyphrases.
We present the KeyWE system, which uses an adapted nominal group chunker for candidate extraction and a supervised ranking algorithm based on support vector machines for ranking the extracted candidates.
The system was evaluated on data provided for the SemEval 2010 Shared Task on Keyphrase Extraction.
