<newSection> Abstract Word sense induction aims to discover different senses of a word from a corpus by using unsupervised learning approaches.
Once a sense inventory is obtained for an ambiguous word, word sense discrimination approaches choose the best-fitting single sense for a given context from the induced sense inventory.
However, there may not be a clear distinction between one sense and another, although for a context, more than one induced sense can be suitable.
Graded word sense method allows for labeling a word in more than one sense.
In contrast to the most common approach which is to apply clustering or graph partitioning on a representation of first or second order co-occurrences of a word, we propose a system that creates a substitute vector for each target word from the most likely substitutes suggested by a statistical language model.
Word samples are then taken according to probabilities of these substitutes and the results of the co-occurrence model are clustered.
This approach outperforms the other systems on graded word sense induction task in SemEval-2013.
