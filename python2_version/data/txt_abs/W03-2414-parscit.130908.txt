<newSection> Abstract Although there are two variants of Dutch, the northern variant being the one used in the Netherlands and the southern variant in Flanders (Belgium), one corpus of spoken Dutch is under construction, the Spoken Dutch Corpus (CON).
In this paper first the principles of this corpus will be discussed, thereafter a few small case studies will show what the merits of such a corpus are.
