<newSection> Abstract BART (Versley et al., 2008) is a highly modular toolkit for coreference resolution that supports state-of-the-art statistical approaches and enables efficient feature engineering.
For the SemEval task 1 on Coreference Resolution, BART runs have been submitted for German, English, and Italian.
BART relies on a maximum entropy-based classifier for pairs of mentions.
A novel entity-mention approach based on Semantic Trees is at the moment only supported for English.
