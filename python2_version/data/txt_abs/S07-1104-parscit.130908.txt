<newSection> Abstract In this paper we describe our participation in the SemEval 2007 Web People Search task.
Our main aim in participating was to adapt language modeling tools for the task, and to experiment with various document representations.
Our main finding is that single pass clustering, using title, snippet and body to represent documents, is the most effective setting.
