<newSection> Abstract The motivation of the Papillon project is to encourage the development of freely accessible Multilingual Lexical Resources by way of online collaborative work on the Internet.
For this, we developed a generic community website originally dedicated to the diffusion and the development of a particular acception based multilingual lexical database.
The generic aspect of our platform allows its use for the development of other lexical databases.
Adapting it to a new lexical database is a matter of description of its structures and interfaces by way of XML files.
In this paper, we show how we already adapted it to other very different lexical databases.
We also show what future developments should be done in order to gather several lexical databases developers in a common network.
