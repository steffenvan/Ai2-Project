<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our participation in the Chinese word segmentation task of CIPS-SIGHAN 2010.
We implemented an n-gram mutual information (NGMI) based segmentation algorithm with the mixed-up features from unsupervised, supervised and dictionary-based segmentation methods.
This algorithm is also combined with a simple strategy for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word recognition.
The evaluation for both open and closed training shows encouraging results of our system.
The results for OOV word recognition in closed training evaluation were however found unsatisfactory.
