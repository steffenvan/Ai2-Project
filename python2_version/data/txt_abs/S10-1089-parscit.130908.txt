<newSection> Abstract Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is one of the main challenges in Computational Linguistics.
TreeMatch is a WSD system originally developed using data from SemEval 2007 Task 7 (Coarse-grained English Allwords Task) that has been adapted for use in SemEval 2010 Task 17 (All-words Word Sense Disambiguation on a Specific Domain).
The system is based on a fully unsupervised method using dependency knowledge drawn from a domain specific knowledge base that was built for this task.
When evaluated on the task, the system precision performs above the First Sense Baseline.
