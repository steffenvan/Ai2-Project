<newSection> Abstract We introduce Peripheral Diversity (PD) as a knowledge-based approach to achieve multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).
PD exploits the frequency and diverse use of word senses in semantic subgraphs derived from larger sense inventories such as BabelNet, Wikipedia, and WordNet in order to achieve WSD.
PDâ€™s f-measure scores for SemEval 2013 Task 12 outperform the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) baseline for two of the five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.
Despite PD remaining under-developed and under-explored, it demonstrates that it is robust, competitive, and encourages development.
