<newSection> 1 Introduction In previous studies, we demonstrated the feasibility of using NLP techniques such as shallow parsing of adjectival modification for identifying hierarchical relations among biomedical terms (Bodenreider et al., 2001) and for extending an existing biomedical terminology (Bodenreider et al., 2002).
In these studies, the corpus was biomedical terminology or phrases extracted from the biomedical literature.
Other authors have explored adjectival modification in a clinical corpus.
Chute and Elkin (1997) note, based on empirical observation of clinical data, that many clinical terms are accompanied by modifiers, including adjectives.
The authors make a distinction between clinical modifiers (such as chronic, severe, and acute) and operational or administrative qualifiers (such as no evidence of, history of, and status post).
It appears that the class of clinical modifiers consists primarily of adjectives that provide specific information regarding condition and are distributed on a scale.
They suggest that operational modifiers be kept separate from the terms themselves in order to avoid combinatorial explosion.
Taking this idea one step further, we believe that, besides operational modifiers, other adjectives encountered in clinical phrases could receive a special treatment in applications such as information retrieval.
For example, adjectives expressing nuances useful only in the context of clinical care could be removed from the phrase when searching the biomedical literature.
This is the case of adjectives expressing degree of certainty (e.g., probable).
In other cases, adjectives specific to clinical phrases can be mapped to synonyms or closely related modifiers (e.g., greenish sputum, green
