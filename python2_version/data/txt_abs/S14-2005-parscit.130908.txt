<newSection> Abstract We present a new cross-lingual task for SemEval concerning the translation of L1 fragments in an L2 context.
The task is at the boundary of Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation and Machine Translation.
It finds its application in the field of computer-assisted translation, particularly in the context of second language learning.
Translating L1 fragments in an L2 context allows language learners when writing in a target language (L2) to fall back to their native language (L1) whenever they are uncertain of the right word or phrase.
