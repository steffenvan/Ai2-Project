<newSection> Abstract Our research aim here is to build a CLIR system that works for a language pair with poor resources where the source language (e.g. Indonesian) has limited language resources.
Our Indonesian-Japanese CLIR system employs the existing Japanese IR system, and we focus our research on the Indonesian-Japanese query translation.
There are two problems in our limited resource query translation: the OOV problem and the translation ambiguity.
The OOV problem is handled using target language’s resources (English-Japanese dictionary and Japanese proper name dictionary).
The translation ambiguity is handled using a Japanese monolingual corpus in our translation filtering.
We select the final translation set using the mutual information score and the TF×IDF score.
The result on NTCIR 3 (NII-NACSIS Test Collection for IR Systems) Web Retrieval Task shows that the translation method achieved a higher IR score than the transitive machine translation (using Kataku (Indonesian-English) and Babelfish/ Excite (English-Japanese) engine) result.
The best result achieved about 49% of the monolingual retrieval.
