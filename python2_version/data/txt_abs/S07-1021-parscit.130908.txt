<newSection> Abstract In SemEval-2007, CL Research participated in the task for Frame Semantic Structure Extraction.
Participation in this task was used as the vehicle for efforts to integrate and exploit FrameNet in a comprehensive text processing system.
In particular, this involved steps to build a FrameNet dictionary with CL Researchâ€™s DIMAP dictionary software and to use this dictionary (along with its semantic network processing capabilities) in processing text into XML representations.
Implementation of the entire integrated package is only in its initial stages and was used to make only a bare submission of frame identification.
On this task, over all texts, a recall of 0.372, a precision of 0.553, and an F-score of 0.445 were achieved.
Considering only targets included in the DIMAP FrameNet dictionary, the overall F-score is 0.605.
These results, competitive with the top scoring system, support continued attempts at a dictionary-based approach to frame structure extraction.
