<newSection> Abstract We describe the implementation and evaluation of a prototype American Sign Language (ASL) generation component that produces animations of ASL classifier predicates, some frequent and complex spatial phenomena in ASL that no previous generation system has produced.
We discuss some challenges in evaluating ASL systems and present the results of a user-based evaluation study of our system.
