<newSection> Abstract The evolution of competing lexical categories is simulated within a model in which lexical outputs are organized as sequences of articulatory gestures.
When exemplar-based categories compete for assignment and storage of incoming exemplars in a production/storage loop, contrast between categories spontaneously emerges and remains stable, driven by the differences in storage consistency between more contrastive and less contrastive variants.
Further, when lexical outputs are biased toward use of previously produced gestures, the set of exemplars in the lexicon evolve to be derived from a small set of contrastive units used in combination, despite the absence of direct selection for contrast at the sub-lexical level.
