<newSection> Abstract When executing commands, a robot has a certain level of contextual knowledge about the environment in which it operates.
Taking this knowledge into account can be beneficial to disambiguate commands with multiple interpretations.
We present an approach that uses combinatory categorial grammars for improving the semantic parsing of robot commands that takes into account the spatial context of the robot.
The results indicate a clear improvement over non-contextual semantic parsing.
This work was done in the context of the SemEval-2014 task on supervised semantic parsing of spatial robot commands.
