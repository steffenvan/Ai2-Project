<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we describe our system submitted for the semantic textual similarity (STS) task at SemEval 2012.
We implemented two approaches to calculate the degree of similarity between two sentences.
First approach combines corpus-based semantic relatedness measure over the whole sentence with the knowledge-based semantic similarity scores obtained for the words falling under the same syntactic roles in both the sentences.
We fed all these scores as features to machine learning models to obtain a single score giving the degree of similarity of the sentences.
Linear Regression and Bagging models were used for this purpose.
We used Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) as the corpus-based semantic relatedness measure.
For the knowledge-based semantic similarity between words, a modified WordNet based Lin measure was used.
Second approach uses a bipartite based method over the WordNet based Lin measure, without any modification.
This paper shows a significant improvement in calculating the semantic similarity between sentences by the fusion of the knowledge-based similarity measure and the corpus-based relatedness measure against corpus based measure taken alone.
