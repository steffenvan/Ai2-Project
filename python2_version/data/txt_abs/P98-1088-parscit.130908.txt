<newSection> Abstract The multiplicative fragment of linear logic has found a number of applications in computational linguistics: in the &quot;glue language&quot; approach to LFG semantics, and in the formulation and parsing of various categorial grammars.
These applications call for efficient deduction methods.
Although a number of deduction methods for multiplicative linear logic are known, none of them are tabular methods, which bring a substantial efficiency gain by avoiding redundant computation (c.f. chart methods in CFG parsing): this paper presents such a method, and discusses its use in relation to the above applications.
