<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we present our system description in task of Cross-lingual Textual Entailment.
The goal of this task is to detect entailment relations between two sentences written in different languages.
To accomplish this goal, we first translate sentences written in foreign languages into English.
Then, we use EDITS1, an open source package, to recognize entailment relations.
Since EDITS only draws monodirectional relations while the task requires bidirectional prediction, thus we exchange the hypothesis and test to detect entailment in another direction.
Experimental results show that our method achieves promising results but not perfect results compared to other participants.
