<newSection> Abstract In performing morpho-phonological sequence processing tasks, such as letter-phoneme conversion or morphological analysis, it is typically not enough to base the output sequence on local decisions that map local-context input windows to single output tokens.
We present a global sequence-processing method that repairs inconsistent local decisions.
The approach is based on local predictions of overlapping trigrams of output tokens, which open up a space of possible sequences; a data-driven constraint satisfaction inference step then searches for the optimal output sequence.
We demonstrate significant improvements in terms of word accuracy on English and Dutch letter-phoneme conversion and morphological segmentation, and we provide qualitative analyses of error types prevented by the constraint satisfaction inference method.
