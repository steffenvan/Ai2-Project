<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a graph-theoretic approach to the identification of yet-unknown word translations.
The proposed algorithm is based on the recursive Sim-Rank algorithm and relies on the intuition that two words are similar if they establish similar grammatical relationships with similar other words.
We also present a formulation of SimRank in matrix form and extensions for edge weights, edge labels and multiple graphs.
