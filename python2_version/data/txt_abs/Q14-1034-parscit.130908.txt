<newSection> Abstract We present MULTIP (Multi-instance Learning Paraphrase Model), a new model suited to identify paraphrases within the short messages on Twitter.
We jointly model paraphrase relations between word and sentence pairs and assume only sentence-level annotations during learning.
Using this principled latent variable model alone, we achieve the performance competitive with a state-of-the-art method which combines a latent space model with a feature-based supervised classifier.
Our model also captures lexically divergent paraphrases that differ from yet complement previous methods; combining our model with previous work significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.
In addition, we present a novel annotation methodology that has allowed us to crowdsource a paraphrase corpus from Twitter.
We make this new dataset available to the research community.
