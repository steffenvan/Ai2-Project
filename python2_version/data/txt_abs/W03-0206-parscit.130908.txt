<newSection> Abstract This paper focuses on the transformation of grammar checking technology into a learning environment for second language writing.
Our starting point is a grammar checker for Swedish, called Granska.
Two studies have been conducted aimed at exploring the use of computer support for writing in the context of second language learning.
In the first study, we developed a methodology to study naturalistic writing, and the impact of the grammar checker on the writerâ€™s text.
In the second study, we were interested in how the methodology developed earlier would work in an educational setting.
The problems with false alarms and limited recall are definitely a sensitive issue in the context of second language learners and educational settings.
Both learners and teachers are concerned about the false alarms, and without perfectly working text analyzers, new strategies for dealing with these problems have to be further explored and developed together with learners and teachers.
