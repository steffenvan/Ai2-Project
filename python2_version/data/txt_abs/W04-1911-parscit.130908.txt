<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we present empirical data from a corpus study on the linear order of subjects and objects in German main clauses.
The aim was to establish the validity of three well-known ordering constraints: given complements tend to occur before new complements, definite before indefinite, and pronoun before full noun phrase complements.
Frequencies of occurrences were derived for subject-first and object-first sentences from the German Negra corpus.
While all three constraints held on subject-first sentences, results for object-first sentences varied.
Our findings suggest an influence of grammatical functions on the ordering of verb complements.
