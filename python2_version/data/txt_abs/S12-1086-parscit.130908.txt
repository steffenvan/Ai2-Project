<newSection> Abstract The Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) shared task (Agirre et al., 2012) computes the degree of semantic equivalence between two sentences.1 We show that a simple unsupervised latent semantics based approach, Weighted Textual Matrix Factorization that only exploits bag-of-words features, can outperform most systems for this task.
The key to the approach is to carefully handle missing words that are not in the sentence, and thus rendering it superior to Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
Our system ranks 20 out of 89 systems according to the official evaluation metric for the task, Pearson correlation, and it ranks 10/89 and 19/89 in the other two evaluation metrics employed by the organizers.
