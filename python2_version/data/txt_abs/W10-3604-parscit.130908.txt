<newSection> Abstract A morphological analyzer forms the foundation for many NLP applications of Indian Languages.
In this paper, we propose and evaluate the morphological analyzer for Marathi, an inflectional language.
The morphological analyzer exploits the efficiency and flexibility offered by finite state machines in modeling the morphotactics while using the well devised system of paradigms to handle the stem alternations intelligently by exploiting the regularity in inflectional forms.
We plug the morphological analyzer with statistical pos tagger and chunker to see its impact on their performance so as to confirm its usability as a foundation for NLP applications.
