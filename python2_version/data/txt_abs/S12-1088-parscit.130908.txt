<newSection> Abstract This paper presents the UNITOR system that participated to the SemEval 2012 Task 6: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS).
The task is here modeled as a Support Vector (SV) regression problem, where a similarity scoring function between text pairs is acquired from examples.
The semantic relatedness between sentences is modeled in an unsupervised fashion through different similarity functions, each capturing a specific semantic aspect of the STS, e.g. syntactic vs. lexical or topical vs. paradigmatic similarity.
The SV regressor effectively combines the different models, learning a scoring function that weights individual scores in a unique resulting STS.
It provides a highly portable method as it does not depend on any manually built resource (e.g. WordNet) nor controlled, e.g. aligned, corpus.
