<newSection> Introduction How should we teach Natural Language Processing and/or Computational Linguistics?
Throughout the forty year history of the organization, many ACL members have responded to this question, finding solutions appropriate to a huge range of different local contexts.
The ensuing diversity in approach is in some ways extremely welcome, but could be isolating for the individual instructor.
This workshop is a forum for sharing of useful tools and experience.
We work in an &quot;interface discipline&quot;.
Most of our work is collaborative and multidisciplinary, and this has immediate consequences for training.
If we are doing our job, we should be able to answer — or at least address — most of the following questions.
better placed to understand and respond to the educational needs of the students and researchers who will create the future of our subject . We can expect the detailed answers to these questions to be site-specific, but we are siure that there are also general insights that can help us all to make our teaching relevant to and supportive of the long term goals of the CL/NLP community.
These issues are noticed by many, but little discussed, and often solved individually on an ad-hoc basis.
The point of this workshop is to facilitate sharing and discussion, and to act as a seed for a community of research and scholarship in the teaching of NLP.
This workshop was made possible, in part, by grant #0226408 from the National Science Foundation.
We are also grateful for contributions of time and effort from many people, especially Mary Taffet, Lillian Lee, Jason Eisner, Robert Dale and the whole of the program committee.
We are grateful to them (and you) for your willingness to spend time on developing an effective and relevant scholarship of teaching for NLP and CL.
