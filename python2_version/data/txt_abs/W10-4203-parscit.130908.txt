<newSection> Abstract In this paper we present a reference generation model based on Reference Domain Theory which gives a dynamic account of reference.
This reference model assumes that each referring act both relies and updates the reference context.
We present a formal definition of a reference domain, a generation algorithm and its instantiation in the GIVE challenge.
