<newSection> Abstract Many types of polysemy are not word specific, but are instances of general sense alternations such as ANIMAL-FOOD.
Despite their pervasiveness, regular alternations have been mostly ignored in empirical computational semantics.
This paper presents (a) a general framework which grounds sense alternations in corpus data, generalizes them above individual words, and allows the prediction of alternations for new words; and (b) a concrete unsupervised implementation of the framework, the Centroid Attribute Model.
We evaluate this model against a set of 2,400 ambiguous words and demonstrate that it outperforms two baselines.
