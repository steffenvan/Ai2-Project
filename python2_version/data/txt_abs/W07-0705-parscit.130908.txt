<newSection> Abstract Current statistical machine translation systems handle the translation process as the transformation of a string of symbols into another string of symbols.
Normally the symbols dealt with are the words in different languages, sometimes with some additional information included, like morphological data.
In this work we try to push the approach to the limit, working not on the level of words, but treating both the source and target sentences as a string of letters.
We try to find out if a nearly unmodified state-of-the-art translation system is able to cope with the problem and whether it is capable to further generalize translation rules, for example at the level of word suffixes and translation of unseen words.
Experiments are carried out for the translation of Catalan to Spanish.
