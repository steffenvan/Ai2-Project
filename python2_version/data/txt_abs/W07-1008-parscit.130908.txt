<newSection> Abstract We describe the annotation of chemical named entities in scientific text.
A set of annotation guidelines defines 5 types of named entities, and provides instructions for the resolution of special cases.
A corpus of fulltext chemistry papers was annotated, with an inter-annotator agreement score of 93%.
An investigation of named entity recognition using LingPipe suggests that scores of 63% are possible without customisation, and scores of 74% are possible with the addition of custom tokenisation and the use of dictionaries.
