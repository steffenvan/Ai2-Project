<newSection> Abstract The Microsoft Research translation system is a syntactically informed phrasal SMT system that uses a phrase translation model based on dependency treelets and a global reordering model based on the source dependency tree.
These models are combined with several other knowledge sources in a log-linear manner.
The weights of the individual components in the loglinear model are set by an automatic parameter-tuning method.
We give a brief overview of the components of the system and discuss our experience with the Europarl data translating from English to Spanish.
