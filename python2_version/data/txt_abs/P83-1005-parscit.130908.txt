<newSection> I INTRODUCTION The editors of the Al Journal recently hit upon the nice notion of correspondents' columns.
The basic idea was to solicit experts in various fields both within and outside of Artificial Intelligence, to provide &quot;guidance to important, interesting current literature&quot; in their fields.
For Philosophy, they made the happy choice of Dan Dennett; for natural language processing, the equally happy choice of Barbara Grosz.
Each has so far contributed one column, and these early contributions overlap in one, and as it happens, only one, particular; to wit: Situation Semantics.
Witness Dennett: ...situation semantics - [is] the hottest new topic in philosophical logic...[is] in some ways a successor or rival to Montague semantics.
In recent work, Barwise and Perry address the problem [of what information from the context of an utterance affects which aspects of interpretation and how?] in the context of a proposed model theory of natural language, one that appears to be more compatible with the needs of Al than previous theories....
[I]t is of interest to work in natural-language processing for the kind of compositional semantics it proposes, and the way in which it allows the contexts in which in an utterance is used to affect its interpretation.
What is all the fuss about?
I want to address this question, but rather indirectly.
I want to situate situation semantics in &quot;conceptual space&quot; and draw some comparisons and contrasts between it and accounts in the style of Richard Montague.
To this end, a few preliminary points are in order.
