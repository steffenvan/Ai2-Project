<newSection> Abstract Information graphics, such as bar charts and line graphs, play an important role in multimodal documents.
This paper presents a novel approach to producing a brief textual summary of a simple bar chart.
It outlines our approach to augmenting the core message of the graphic to produce a brief summary.
Our method simultaneously constructs both the discourse and sentence structures of the textual summary using a bottom-up approach.
The result is then realized in natural language.
An evaluation study validates our generation methodology.
