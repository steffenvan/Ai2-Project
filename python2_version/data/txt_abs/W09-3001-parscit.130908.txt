<newSection> Abstract Emotion computing is very important for expressive information extraction.
In this paper, we provide a robust and versatile emotion annotation scheme based on cognitive emotion theories, which not only can annotate both explicit and implicit emotion expressions, but also can encode different levels of emotion information for the given emotion content.
In addition, motivated by a cognitive framework, an automatic emotion annotation system is developed, and large and comparatively high-quality emotion corpora are created for emotion computing, one in Chinese and the other in English.
Such an annotation system can be easily adapted for different kinds of emotion applications and be extended to other languages.
