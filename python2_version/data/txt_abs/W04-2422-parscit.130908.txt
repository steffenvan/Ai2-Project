<newSection> Abstract This paper presents our work on Semantic Role Labeling using a Transformation-Based Error-Driven approach in the style of Eric Brill (Brill, 1995).
Our approach achieved an overall Fl score of 43.48 on non-verb annotations.
We believe our approach is noteworthy because of its novelty in this area and because it produces short lists of human-understandable transformation rules as its output.
