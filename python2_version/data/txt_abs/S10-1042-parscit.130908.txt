<newSection> Abstract The UvT system is based on a hybrid, linguistic and statistical approach, originally proposed for the recognition of multiword terminological phrases, the C-value method (Frantzi et al., 2000).
In the UvT implementation, we use an extended noun phrase rule set and take into consideration orthographic and morphological variation, term abbreviations and acronyms, and basic document structure information.
