<newSection> Abstract Transliteration is defined as phonetic translation of names across languages.
Transliteration of Named Entities (NEs) is necessary in many applications, such as machine translation, corpus alignment, cross-language IR, information extraction and automatic lexicon acquisition.
All such systems call for high-performance transliteration, which is the focus of the shared task in the NEWS 2009 workshop.
The objective of the shared task is to promote machine transliteration research by providing a common benchmarking platform for the community to evaluate the state-of-the-art technologies.
