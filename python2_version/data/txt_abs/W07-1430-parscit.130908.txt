<newSection> Abstract As shown in the formal semantics literature, adjectives can display very different inferential patterns depending on whether they are intersective, privative, subsective or plain non-subsective.
Moreover, many of these classes are often described using second order constructs.
In this paper, we adopt Hobbsâ€™s ontologically promiscuous approach and present a first order treatment of adjective semantics which opens the way for a sophisticated treatment of adjectival inference.
The approach was implemented and tested using first order automated reasoners.
