<newSection> Abstract In natural language generation, different generation tasks often interact with each other in a complex way.
We think that how to resolve the complex interactions inside and between tasks is more important to the generation of a coherent text than how to model each individual factor.
This paper focuses on the interaction between aggregation and text planning, and tries to explore what preferences exist among the features considered by the two tasks.
The preferences are implemented in two generation systems, namely ILEX-TS and a text planner using a Genetic Algorithm.
The evaluation emphasises the second implementation and shows that capturing these preferences properly can lead to coherent text.
