<newSection> Abstract An important problem that is related to phrase-based statistical translation models is the obtaining of word phrases from an aligned bilingual training corpus.
In this work, we propose obtaining word phrases by means of a Stochastic Inversion Translation Grammar.
Experiments on the shared task proposed in this workshop with the Europarl corpus have been carried out and good results have been obtained.
