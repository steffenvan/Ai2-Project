<newSection> Abstract We report progress on adding affect-detection to a program for virtual dramatic improvisation, monitored by a human director.
We have developed an affect-detection module to control an automated virtual actor and to contribute to the automation of directorial functions.
The work also involves basic research into how affect is conveyed through metaphor.
The project contributes to the application of sentiment and subjectivity analysis to the creation of emotionally believable synthetic agents for interactive narrative environments.
