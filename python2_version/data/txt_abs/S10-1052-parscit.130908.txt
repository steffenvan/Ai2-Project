<newSection> Abstract We describe a system which ranks human-provided paraphrases of noun compounds, where the frequency with which a given paraphrase was provided by human volunteers is the gold standard for ranking.
Our system assigns a score to a paraphrase of a given compound according to the number of times it has co-occurred with other paraphrases in the rest of the dataset.
We use these co-occurrence statistics to compute conditional probabilities to estimate a sub-typing or Is-A relation between paraphrases.
This method clusters together paraphrases which have similar meanings and also favours frequent, general paraphrases rather than infrequent paraphrases with more specific meanings.
