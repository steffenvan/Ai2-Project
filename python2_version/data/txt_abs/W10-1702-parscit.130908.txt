<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a fast consensus hypothesis regeneration approach for machine translation.
It combines the advantages of feature-based fast consensus decoding and hypothesis regeneration.
Our approach is more efficient than previous work on hypothesis regeneration, and it explores a wider search space than consensus decoding, resulting in improved performance.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across language pairs, and an improvement of up to 0.72 BLEU is obtained over a competitive single-pass baseline on the Chinese-toEnglish NIST task.
