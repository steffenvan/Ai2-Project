<newSection> Abstract We present a novel context pattern induction method for information extraction, specifically named entity extraction.
Using this method, we extended several classes of seed entity lists into much larger high-precision lists.
Using token membership in these extended lists as additional features, we improved the accuracy of a conditional random field-based named entity tagger.
In contrast, features derived from the seed lists decreased extractor accuracy.
