<newSection> Abstract We describe FSS-TimEx, a module for the recognition and normalization of temporal expressions we submitted to Task A and B of the TempEval-3 challenge.
FSS-TimEx was developed as part of a multilingual event extraction system, Nexus, which runs on top of the EMM news processing engine.
It consists of finite-state rule cascades, using minimalis-tic text processing stages and simple heuristics to model the relations between events and temporal expressions.
Although FSS-TimEx is already deployed within an IE application in the medical domain, we found it useful to customize its output to the TimeML standard in order to have an independent performance measure and guide further developments.
