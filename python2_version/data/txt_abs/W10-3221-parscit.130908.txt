<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a current status of Thai resources and tools for CG development.
We also proposed a Thai categorial dependency grammar (CDG), an extended version of CG which includes dependency analysis into CG notation.
Beside, an idea of how to group a word that has the same functions are presented to gain a certain type of category per word.
We also discuss about a difficulty of building treebank and mention a toolkit for assisting on a Thai CGs tree building and a tree format representations.
In this paper, we also give a summary of applications related to Thai CGs.
