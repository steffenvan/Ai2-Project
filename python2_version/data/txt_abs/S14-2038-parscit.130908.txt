<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our system used in the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Task 4 at the SemEval-2014.
Our system consists of two components to address two of the subtasks respectively: a Conditional Random Field (CRF) based classifier for Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) and a linear classifier for Aspect Term Polarity Classification (ATP).
For the ATE subtask, we implement a variety of lexicon, syntactic and semantic features, as well as cluster features induced from unlabeled data.
Our system achieves state-of-the-art performances in ATE, ranking 1st (among 28 submissions) and 2rd (among 27 submissions) for the restaurant and laptop domain respectively.
