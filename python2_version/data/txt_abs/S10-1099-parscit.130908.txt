<newSection> Abstract The task of extracting the opinion expressed in text is challenging due to different reasons.
One of them is that the same word (in particular, adjectives) can have different polarities depending on the context.
This paper presents the experiments carried out by the OpAL team for the participation in the SemEval 2010 Task 18 â€“ Disambiguation of Sentiment Ambiguous Adjectives.
Our approach is based on three different strategies: a) the evaluation of the polarity of the whole context using an opinion mining system; b) the assessment of the polarity of the local context, given by the combinations between the closest nouns and the adjective to be classified; c) rules aiming at refining the local semantics through the spotting of modifiers.
The final decision for classification is taken according to the output of the majority of these three approaches.
The method used yielded good results, the OpAL system run ranking fifth among 16 in micro accuracy and sixth in macro accuracy.
