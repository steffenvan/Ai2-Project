<newSection> INTRODUCTICN SEMSYN's generation module is developed within a German/Japanese MT project.
FUjitsu Research Labs.
provide semantic representations that are produced as an interim data structure of their Japanese/English MT system ATLAS/II (Uchida & Sugiyama, 1980).
The feasibility of the approach of using a semantic representation as an interlingua in a practical application will be investigated and demonstrated by translating titles of Japanese papers from the field of &quot;Information Technology&quot;.
This material comes from Japanese documentation data bases and contains in addition to titles also their respective abstracts.
Our design of the generation component is not limited to titles, but takes extensibility to abstracts and full texts into account.
The envisioned future application of a Japanese/German translation system is to provide natural language access to Japanese documentation data bases.
