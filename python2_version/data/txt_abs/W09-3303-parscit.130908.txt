<newSection> Abstract Wiktionary, a satellite of the Wikipedia initiative, can be seen as a potential resource for Natural Language Processing.
It requires however to be processed before being used efffciently as an NLP resource.
After describing the relevant aspects of Wiktionary for our purposes, we focus on its structural properties.
Then, we describe how we extracted synonymy networks from this resource.
We provide an in-depth study of these synonymy networks and compare them to those extracted from traditional resources.
Finally, we describe two methods for semiautomatically improving this network by adding missing relations: (i) using a kind of semantic proximity measure; (ii) using translation relations of Wiktionary itself.
Note: The experiments of this paper are based on Wiktionaryâ€™s dumps downloaded in year 2008.
Differences may be observed with the current versions available online.
