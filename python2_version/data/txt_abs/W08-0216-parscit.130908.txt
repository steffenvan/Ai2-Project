<newSection> Abstract This paper argues for teaching computer science to linguists through a general course at the introductory graduate level whose goal is to prepare students of all backgrounds for collaborative computational research, especially in the sciences.
We describe our work over the past three years in creating a model course in the area, called Computational Thinking.
What makes this course distinctive is its combined emphasis on the formulation and solution of computational problems, strategies for interdisciplinary communication, and critical thinking about computational explanations.
