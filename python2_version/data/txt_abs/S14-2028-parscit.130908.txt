<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the system we submitted to the SemEval-2014 shared task on sentiment analysis in Twitter.
Our system is a hybrid combination of two system developed for a course project at CMU-Qatar.
We use an SVM classifier and couple a set of features from one system with feature and parameter optimization framework from the second system.
Most of the tuning and feature selection efforts were originally aimed at task-A of the shared task.
We achieve an F-score of 84.4% for task-A and 62.71% for task-B and the systems are ranked 3rd and 29th respectively.
