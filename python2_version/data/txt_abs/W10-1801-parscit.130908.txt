<newSection> Abstract The exponential growth of the subjective information in the framework of the Web 2.0 has led to the need to create Natural Language Processing tools able to analyse and process such data for multiple practical applications.
They require training on specifically annotated corpora, whose level of detail must be fine enough to capture the phenomena involved.
This paper presents EmotiBlog – a finegrained annotation scheme for subjectivity.
We show the manner in which it is built and demonstrate the benefits it brings to the systems using it for training, through the experiments we carried out on opinion mining and emotion detection.
We employ corpora of different textual genres –a set of annotated reported speech extracted from news articles, the set of news titles annotated with polarity and emotion from the SemEval 2007 (Task 14) and ISEAR, a corpus of real-life self-expressed emotion.
We also show how the model built from the EmotiBlog annotations can be enhanced with external resources.
The results demonstrate that EmotiBlog, through its structure and annotation paradigm, offers high quality training data for systems dealing both with opinion mining, as well as emotion detection.
