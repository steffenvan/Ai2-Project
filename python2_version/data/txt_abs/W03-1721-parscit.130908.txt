<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a primarily data-driven Chinese word segmentation system and its performances on the closed track using two corpora at the first international Chinese word segmentation bakeoff.
The system consists of a new words recognizer, a base segmentation algorithm, and procedures for combining single characters, suffixes, and checking segmentation consistencies.
