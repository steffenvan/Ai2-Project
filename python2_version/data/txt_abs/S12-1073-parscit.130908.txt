<newSection> Abstract The goal of semantic dependency parsing is to build dependency structure and label semantic relation between a head and its modifier.
To attain this goal, we concentrate on obtaining better dependency structure to predict better semantic relations, and propose a method to combine the results of three state-of-the-art dependency parsers.
Unfortunately, we made a mistake when we generate the final output that results in a lower score of 56.31% in term of Labeled Attachment Score (LAS), reported by organizers.
After giving golden testing set, we fix the bug and rerun the evaluation script, this time we obtain the score of 62.8% which is consistent with the results on developing set.
We will report detailed experimental results with correct program as a comparison standard for further research.
