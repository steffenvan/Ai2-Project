<newSection> 1 HISTORY AND STATUS Machine translation research at the LRC began with the founding of the center in 1961.
For much of the history of this research, funding came from the U.S. Air Force's Rome Air Development Center and other U.S. government agencies.
In January 1979, Siemens AG began funding the current development phase of the METAL system; the project then comprised one full-time and five or six half-time workers.
As a result of Siemens's support, the existing system was scrapped and a new implementation effort was undertaken in the spring of that year; the project staff grew slowly at first, but with a recent substantial increase now numbers seven full-time and five half-time workers.
The first operational version of the system was delivered to the sponsor for market testing in January 1985.
The current system translates only from German into English, although work to add other Target Languages (Spanish and Chinese), as well as a second Source Language (English), is underway.
The German grammar in its present form contains more than 600 rules; the lexicon has well in excess of 20,000 monolingual entries for German and English, and is expected to double in size in the near future.
