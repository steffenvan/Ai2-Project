<newSection> Abstract Optimizing the production, maintenance and extension of lexical resources is one the crucial aspects impacting Natural Language Processing (NLP).
A second aspect involves optimizing the process leading to their integration in applications.
With this respect, we believe that the production of a consensual specification on multilingual lexicons can be a useful aid for the various NLP actors.
Within ISO, one purpose of LMF (ISO24613) is to define a standard for lexicons that covers multilingual data.
