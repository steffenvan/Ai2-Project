<newSection> Abstract Effective transliteration of proper names via grapheme conversion needs to find transliteration patterns in training data, and then generate optimized candidates for testing samples accordingly.
However, the top-1 accuracy for the generated candidates cannot be good if the right one is not ranked at the top.
To tackle this issue, we propose to rerank the output candidates for a better order using the averaged perceptron with multiple features.
This paper describes our recent work in this direction for our participation in NEWS2010 transliteration evaluation.
The official results confirm its effectiveness in English-Chinese bidirectional transliteration.
