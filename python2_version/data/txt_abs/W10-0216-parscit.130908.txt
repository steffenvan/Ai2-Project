<newSection> Abstract In this work, we propose a novel representation of text based on patterns derived from linguistic annotation graphs.
We use a subgraph mining algorithm to automatically derive features as frequent subgraphs from the annotation graph.
This process generates a very large number of features, many of which are highly correlated.
We propose a genetic programming based approach to feature construction which creates a fixed number of strong classification predictors from these subgraphs.
We evaluate the benefit gained from evolved structured features, when used in addition to the bag-of-words features, for a sentiment classification task.
