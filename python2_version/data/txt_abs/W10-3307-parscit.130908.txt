<newSection> Abstract Increasing biosurveillance capacity is a public health priority in both the developed and the developing world.

This paper describes the construction and preliminary evaluation of a syndromic surveillance orientated application ontology designed to facilitate the early identification of Influenza-LikeIllness syndrome from Emergency Room clinical reports using natural language processing.
