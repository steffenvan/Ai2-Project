<newSection> Abstract We present a Question Answering system for technical domains which makes an intelligent use of paraphrases to increase the likelihood of finding the answer to the userâ€™s question.
The system implements a simple and efficient logic representation of questions and answers that maps paraphrases to the same underlying semantic representation.
Further, paraphrases of technical terminology are dealt with by a separate process that detects surface variants.
