<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we describe our systems for CIPS-SIGHAN-2010 bake-off task of Chinese word segmentation, which focused on the cross-domain performance of Chinese word segmentation algorithms.
We use the online passive-aggressive algorithm with domain invariant information for cross-domain Chinese word segmentation.
