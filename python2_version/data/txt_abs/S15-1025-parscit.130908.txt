<newSection> Abstract An English entity linking (EL) workflow is presented, which combines the annotations of five public open source EL services.
The annotations are combined through a weighted voting scheme inspired by the ROVER method, which had not been previously tested on EL outputs.
The combined results improved over each individual systemâ€™s results, as evaluated on four different golden sets.
