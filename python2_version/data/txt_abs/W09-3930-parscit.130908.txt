<newSection> Abstract Given the increasing amount of conversation data, techniques to automatically acquire information about conversation participants have become more important.
Towards this goal, we investigate the problem of conversation entailment, a task that determines whether a given conversation discourse entails a hypothesis about the participants.
This paper describes the challenges related to conversation entailment based on our collected data and presents a probabilistic framework that incorporates conversation context in entailment prediction.
Our preliminary experimental results have shown that conversation context, in particular dialogue act, plays an important role in conversation entailment.
