<newSection> Abstract We perform a study of existing dialogue corpora to establish the theoretical maximum performance of the selection approach to simulating human dialogue behavior in unseen dialogues.
This maximum is the proportion of test utterances for which an exact or approximate match exists in the corresponding training corpus.
The results indicate that some domains seem quite suitable for a corpus-based selection approach, with over half of the test utterances having been seen before in the corpus, while other domains show much more novelty compared to previous dialogues.
