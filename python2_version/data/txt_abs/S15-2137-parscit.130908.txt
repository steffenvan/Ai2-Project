<newSection> Abstract The 2015 Clinical TempEval Challenge addressed the problem of temporal reasoning in the clinical domain by providing an annotated corpus of pathology and clinical notes related to colon cancer patients.
The challenge consisted of six subtasks: TIMEX3 and event span detection, TIMEX3 and event attribute classification, document relation time and narrative container relation classification.
Our BluLab team participated in all six subtasks.
For the TIMEX3 and event subtasks, we developed a ClearTK support vector machine pipeline using mainly simple lexical features along with information from rule-based systems.
For the relation subtasks, we employed a conditional random fields classification approach, with input from a rule-based system for the narrative container relation subtask.
Our team ranked first for all TIMEX3 and event subtasks, as well as for the document relation subtask.
