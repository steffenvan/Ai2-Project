<newSection> Abstract When tweeting on a topic, Twitter users often post messages that convey the same or similar meaning.
We describe TweetingJay, a system for detecting paraphrases and semantic similarity of tweets, with which we participated in Task 1 of SemEval 2015.
TweetingJay uses a supervised model that combines semantic overlap and word alignment features, previously shown to be effective for detecting semantic textual similarity.
TweetingJay reaches 65.9% F1-score and ranked fourth among the 18 participating systems.
We additionally provide an analysis of the dataset and point to some peculiarities of the evaluation setup.
