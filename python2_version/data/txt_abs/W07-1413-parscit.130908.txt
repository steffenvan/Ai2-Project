<newSection> Abstract This document contains the description of the experiments carried out by SINAI group.
We have developed an approach based on several lexical and syntactic measures integrated by means of different machine learning models.
More precisely, we have evaluated three features based on lexical similarity and 11 features based on syntactic tree comparison.
In spite of the relatively straightforward approach we have obtained more than 60% for accuracy.
Since this is our first participation we think we have reached a good result.
