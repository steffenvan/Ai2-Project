<newSection> Abstract We present a proposal for the annotation of multi-word expressions in a 1M corpus of contemporary portuguese.
Our aim is to create a resource that allows us to study multi-word expressions (MWEs) in their context.
The corpus will be a valuable additional resource next to the already existing MWE lexicon that was based on a much larger corpus of 50M words.
In this paper we discuss the problematic cases for annotation and proposed solutions, focusing on the variational properties of MWEs.
