<newSection> Abstract This paper presents the approach of the CISUC-KIS team to the SemEval 2014 task on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, more precisely subtask B - Message Polarity Classification.
We followed a machine learning approach where a SVM classifier was trained from a large and diverse set of features that included lexical, syntactic, sentiment and semantic-based aspects.
This led to very interesting results which, in different datasets, put us always in the top-7 scores, including second position in the LiveJournal2014 dataset.
