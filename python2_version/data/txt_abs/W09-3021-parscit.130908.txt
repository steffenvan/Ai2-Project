<newSection> Abstract WordNet and FrameNet are widely used lexical resources, but they are very different from each other and are often used in completely different ways in NLP.
In a case study in which a short passage is annotated in both frameworks, we show how the synsets and definitions of WordNet and the syntagmatic information from FrameNet can complement each other, forming a more complete representation of the lexical semantic of a text than either could alone.
Close comparisons between them also suggest ways in which they can be brought into alignment.
