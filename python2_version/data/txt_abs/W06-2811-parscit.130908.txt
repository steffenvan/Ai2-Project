<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a proposal for iCLEF 2006, the interactive track of the CLEF cross-language evaluation campaign.
In the past, iCLEF has addressed applications such as information retrieval and question answering.
However, for 2006 the focus has turned to text-based image retrieval from Flickr.
We describe Flickr, the challenges this kind of collection presents to cross-language researchers, and suggest initial iCLEF tasks.
