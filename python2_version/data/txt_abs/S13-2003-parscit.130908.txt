<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we describe our participation in the TempEval-3 challenge.
With our multilingual temporal tagger HeidelTime, we addressed task A, the extraction and normalization of temporal expressions for English and Spanish.
Exploiting HeidelTime’s strict separation between source code and language-dependent parts, we tuned HeidelTime’s existing English resources and developed new Spanish resources.
For both languages, we achieved the best results among all participants for task A, the combination of extraction and normalization.
Both the improved English and the new Spanish resources are publicly available with HeidelTime.
