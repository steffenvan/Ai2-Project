<newSection> Abstract We present a simple, two-steps supervised strategy for the identification and classification of thematic roles in natural language texts.
We employ no external source of information but automatic parse trees of the input sentences.
We use a few attribute-value features and tree kernel functions applied to specialized structured features.
The resulting system has an F1 of 75.44 on the SemEval2007 closed task on semantic role labeling.
