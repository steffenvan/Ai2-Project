<newSection> Abstract In this paper I shall present a treatment of lexical and grammatical tone and vowel length in Hausa, as implemented in an emerging bidirectional HPSG of the language based on the Lingo Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002).
I shall argue in particular that a systematic treatment of suprasegmental phonology is indispensible in an implemented grammar of the language, both for theoretical and practical reasons.
I shall propose an LKB representation that is strongly inspired by linguistic and computational work on Autosegmental Phonology.
Finally, I shall show that the specific implementation presented here is flexible enough to accommodate different levels of suprasegmental information in the input.
