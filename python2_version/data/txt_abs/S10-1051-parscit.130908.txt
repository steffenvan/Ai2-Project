<newSection> Abstract This paper addresses the problem of ranking a list of paraphrases associated with a noun-noun compound as closely as possible to human raters (Butnariu et al., 2010).
UCD-Goggle tackles this task using semantic knowledge learnt from the Google n-grams together with human-preferences for paraphrases mined from training data.
Empirical evaluation shows that UCD-Goggle achieves 0.432 Spearman correlation with human judgments.
