<newSection> Abstract Models of lexical semantics are core paradigms in most NLP applications, such as dialogue, information extraction and document understanding.
Unfortunately, the coverage of currently available resources (e.g. FrameNet) is still unsatisfactory.
This paper presents a largely applicable approach for extending frame semantic resources, combining word sense information derived from WordNet and corpus-based distributional information.
We report a large scale evaluation over the English FrameNet, and results on extending FrameNet to the Italian language, as the basis of the development of a full FrameNet for Italian.
