<newSection> Abstract We present an automatic multi-document summarization system for Dutch based on the MEAD system.
We focus on redundancy detection, an essential ingredient of multi-document summarization.
We introduce a semantic overlap detection tool, which goes beyond simple string matching.
Our results so far do not confirm our expectation that this tool would outperform the other tested methods.
