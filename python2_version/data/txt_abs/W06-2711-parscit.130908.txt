<newSection> Abstract We demonstrate work in progress1 using the Nite XML Toolkit on a corpus of multimodal dialogues with an MP3 player collected in a Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) experiments and annotated with a rich feature set at several layers.
We designed an NXT data model, converted experiment log file data and manual transcriptions into NXT, and are building annotation tools using NXT libraries.
