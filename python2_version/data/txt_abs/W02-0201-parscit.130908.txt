<newSection> Abstract Most dialogue architectures are either pipelined or, if agent-based, are restricted to a pipelined flow-of-information.
The TRIPS dialogue architecture is agent-based and asynchronous, with several layers of information flow.
We present this architecture and the synchronization issues we encountered in building a truly distributed, agent-based dialogue architecture.
