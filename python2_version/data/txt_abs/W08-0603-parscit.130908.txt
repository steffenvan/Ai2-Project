<newSection> Abstract An adaptable relation extraction system for the biomedical domain is presented.
The system makes use of a large set of contextual and shallow syntactic features, which can be automatically optimised for each relation type.
The system is tested on three different relation types; protein-protein interactions, tissue expression relations and fragment to parent protein relations.
