<newSection> Abstract A class of constraint-based categorial grammars is proposed in which the construction of both logical forms and strings is specified completely lexically.
Such grammars allow the construction of a uniform algorithm for both parsing and generation.
Termination of the algorithm can be guaranteed if lexical entries adhere to a constraint, that can be seen as a computationally motivated version of GB's projection principle.
