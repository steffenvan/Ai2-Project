Abstract The application-driven construction of lexicon has been emphasized as a methodology of Computational Lexicology recently.
We focus on the closed semantic constraint of the argument(s) of any verb concept by the noun concepts in a WordNet-like lexicon, which theoretically is related to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) at different levels.
From the viewpoint of Dynamic Lexicon, WSD provides a way of automatic construction for the closed semantic constraints and also benefits from the semantic descriptions.
