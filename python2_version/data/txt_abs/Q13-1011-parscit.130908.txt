<newSection> Abstract During the course of first language acquisition, children produce linguistic forms that do not conform to adult grammar.
In this paper, we introduce a data set and approach for systematically modeling this child-adult grammar divergence.
Our corpus consists of child sentences with corrected adult forms.
We bridge the gap between these forms with a discriminatively reranked noisy channel model that translates child sentences into equivalent adult utterances.
Our method outperforms MT and ESL baselines, reducing child error by 20%.
Our model allows us to chart specific aspects of grammar development in longitudinal studies of children, and investigate the hypothesis that children share a common developmental path in language acquisition.
