<newSection> Abstract Karamel is a system for finite-state morphology which is multi-tape and uses a typed Cartesian product to relate tapes in a structured way.
It implements statically compiled feature structures.
Its language allows the use of regular expressions and Generalized Restriction rules to define multi-tape transducers.
Both simultaneous and successive application of local constraints are possible.
This system is interesting for describing rich and structured morphologies such as the morphology of Semitic languages.
