<newSection> Abstract Our CoNLL-2010 speculative sentence detector disambiguates putative keywords based on the following considerations: a speculative keyword may be composed of one or more word tokens; a speculative sentence may have one or more speculative keywords; and if a sentence contains at least one real speculative keyword, it is deemed speculative.
A tree kernel classifier is used to assess whether a potential speculative keyword conveys speculation.
We exploit information implicit in tree structures.
For prediction efficiency, only a segment of the whole tree around a speculation keyword is considered, along with morphological features inside the segment and information about the containing document.
A maximum entropy classifier is used for sentences not covered by the tree kernel classifier.
Experiments on the Wikipedia data set show that our system achieves 0.55 F-measure (in-domain).
