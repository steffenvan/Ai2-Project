<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we propose a simple, language-independent and highly effective method for predicting the degree of compositionality of multiword expressions (MWEs).
We compare the translations of an MWE with the translations of its components, using a range of different languages and string similarity measures.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two types of English MWEs: noun compounds and verb particle constructions.
The results show that our approach is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art methods over standard datasets.
