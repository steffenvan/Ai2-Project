<newSection> Abstract Amharic is the Semitic language that has the second large number of speakers after Arabic (Hayward and Richard 1999).
Its writing system is syllabic with Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllable structure.
Amharic orthography has more or less a one to one correspondence with syllabic sounds.
We have used this feature of Amharic to develop a CV syllable-based speech recognizer, using Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM), and achieved 90.43% word recognition accuracy.
