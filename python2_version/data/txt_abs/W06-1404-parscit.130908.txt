<newSection> Abstract We describe an implemented generator for a spoken dialogue system that follows the ‘overgeneration and ranking’ approach.
We find that overgeneration based on bottom-up chart generation is well-suited to a) model phenomena such as alignment and variation in dialogue, and b) address robustness issues in the face of imperfect generation input.
We report evaluation results of a first user study involving 20 subjects.
