<newSection> Abstract The BioNLPÂ´09 Shared Task on Event Extraction presented an evaluation on the extraction of biological events related to genes/proteins from the literature.
We propose a system that uses the case-based reasoning (CBR) machine learning approach for the extraction of the entities (events, sites and location).
The mapping of the proteins in the texts to the previously extracted entities is carried out by some simple manually developed rules for each of the arguments under consideration (cause, theme, site or location).
We have achieved an f-measure of 24.15 and 21.15 for Task 1 and 2, respectively.
