<newSection> Abstract Recently, dependency grammar has gained renewed attention as empirical methods in parsing have emphasized the importance of relations between words, which is what dependency grammars model explicitly, but context-free phrase-structure grammars do not.
While there has been much work on formalizing dependency grammar and on parsing algorithms for dependency grammars in the past, there is not a complete generative formalization of dependency grammar based on string-rewriting in which the derivation structure is the desired dependency structure.
Such a system allows for the definition of a compact parse forest in a straightforward manner.
In this paper, we present a simple generative formalism for dependency grammars based on Extended Context-Free Grammar, along with a parser; the formalism captures the intuitions of previous formalizations while deviating minimally from the much-used Context-Free Grammar.
