<newSection> Abstract This paper seeks to draw attention to a large gap in the current spectrum of research relating to treebanks (linguistically interpreted corpora).
There has been substantial work on defining schemes of grammatical annotation, developing automatic parsers for applying those schemes to language samples, and measuring the performance of automatic parsers, but there has been next to no work on establishing the baseline of human analytic accuracy â€” although this is logically necessary as an underpinning to the other three activities.
Apart from arguing this case, the paper also briefly describes a forthcoming pilot project which will aim to begin to fill the gap it identifies.
