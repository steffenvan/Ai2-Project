<newSection> Abstract Indirect negative evidence is clearly an important way for learners to constrain over-generalisation, and yet a good learning theoretic analysis has yet to be provided for this, whether in a PAC or a probabilistic identification in the limit framework.
In this paper we suggest a theoretical analysis of indirect negative evidence that allows the presence of ungrammatical strings in the input and also accounts for the relationship between grammaticality/acceptability and probability.
Given independently justified assumptions about lower bounds on the probabilities of grammatical strings, we establish that a limited number of membership queries of some strings can be probabilistically simulated.
