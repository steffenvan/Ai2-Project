<newSection> Abstract We describe our experiments with hierarchical phrase-based machine translation for WMT 2010 Shared Task.
We provide a detailed description of our configuration and data so the results are replicable.
For English-to-Czech translation, we experiment with several datasets of various sizes and with various preprocessing sequences.
For the other 7 translation directions, we just present the baseline results.
