<newSection> Abstract This paper presents the first step to project POS tags and dependencies from English and French to Polish in aligned corpora.
Both the English and French parts of the corpus are analysed with a POS tagger and a robust parser.
The English/Polish bi-text and the French/Polish bi-text are then aligned at the word level with the Giza++ package.
The intersection of IBM-4 Viterbi alignments for both translation directions is used to project the annotations from English and French to Polish.
The results show that the precision of direct projection vary according to the type of induced annotations as well as the source language.
Moreover, the performances are likely to be improved by defining regular conversion rules among POS tags and dependencies.
