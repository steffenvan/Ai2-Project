<newSection> Abstract In the recognition of words that are typical of a specific language variety, the classic keyword approach performs rather poorly.
We show how this keyword analysis can be complemented with a word space model constructed on the basis of two corpora: one representative of the language variety under investigation, and a reference corpus.
This combined approach is able to recognize the markers of a language variety as words that not only have a significantly higher frequency as compared to the reference corpus, but also a different distribution.
The application of word space models moreover makes it possible to automatically discover the lexical alternative to a specific marker in the reference corpus.
