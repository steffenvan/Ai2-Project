<newSection> Abstract The two current approaches to language generation, template-based and rule-based (linguistic) NLG, have limitations when applied to spoken dialogue systems, in part because they were developed for text generation.
In this paper, we propose a new corpus-based approach to natural language generation, specifically designed for spoken dialogue systems.
