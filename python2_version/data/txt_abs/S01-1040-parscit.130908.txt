<newSection> Abstract This article describes the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) sense disambiguation systems that participated in seven SENSEVAL2 tasks: four supervised lexical choice systems (Basque, English, Spanish, Swedish), one unsupervised lexical choice system (Italian) and two supervised all-words systems (Czech, Estonian).
The common core supervised system utilizes voting-based classifier combination over several diverse systems, including decision lists (Yarowsky, 2000), a cosine-based vector model and two Bayesian classifiers.
The classifiers employed a rich set of features, including words, lemmas and part-of-speech informatino modeled in several syntactic relationships (e.g. verb-object), bag-of-words context and local collocational n-grams.
The allwords systems relied heavily on morphological analysis in the two highly inflected languages.
The unsupervised Italian system was a hierarchical class model using the Italian WordNet.
