Abstract


The goal of this paper is to describe how the
EuroWordNet framework for representing
lexical meaning is being modified within an
Italian National Project in order to include
information on adjectives. The focus is on
the 'new' semantic relations being encoded
and on the revisions we have made to the
EuroWordNet Top Ontology structure. We
also briefly discuss the utility of the
information which is being encoded for
computational applications.


Introduction


The Princeton WordNet (henceforth WN) is a
lexical semantic network in which the meanings
of words are represented in terms of their
conceptual and lexical relations to other words.
The basic notion around which it is developed is
that of a synset (synonyms set), i.e. a set of
words with the same Part-of-Speech (PoS) that
can be interchanged in a certain context. Various
conceptual and lexical relations are then
encoded between synsets of the same PoS: e.g.,
hyponymy, antonymy, meronymy, etc. (Miller et
al. 1990; Fellbaum 1998b).
Within the EuroWordNet (henceforth EWN)
project' a similar (multilingual) lexical resource
was developed, retaining the basic underlying
design of WN, but enriching the set of lexicalsemantic relations to be encoded for nouns and
verbs in various ways2, in order to obtain a
maximally re-usable resource for computational
applications. Thus, a) cross-PoS (xPos) relations
were added so that different surface realizations
of similar concepts within and across languages
could be matched (e.g., the noun research and
the verb to research could be linked as
EWN was a project in the EC Language
Engineering (LE-4003 and LE-8328) programme. In
a first phase, the partners involved were the


University of Amsterdam (coordinator); the Istituto
di Linguistica Computazionale, CNR, Pisa; the
Fundacion Universidad Empresa (a cooperation of
UNED, Madrid, Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona,
and the University of Barcelona); the University of
Sheffield; and Novell Linguistic Development
(Antwerp), changed to Lernout & Hauspie during the


project. In a further phase, the database was extended
with German, French, Estonian and Czech. Complete
information on EWN can be found at its web site:
http://www.hum.uva.n1/—ewn/.

'XPOS_NEAR_SYNONYMS' in EWN); b) some
relations were identified which provide detailed
information on semantic components lexicalized
within word roots (e.g., to hammer could be
linked to the noun hammer by means of an
'INVOLVED...INSTRUMENT' relation); C) some
labels were distinguished which could be added
to relations to make their semantic entailments
more explicit and precise (cf. Alonge et al.
1998). The links among the wordnets of
different languages were realized by means of an
Interlingual-Index (ILI), constituted by an
unstructured list of the Princeton WN (version
1.5) synsets. In addition, a hierarchy of
language-independent concepts, reflecting
fundamental semantic distinctions (e.g., Object
and Substance, Dynamic and Static, Cause,
Manner, etc.), was built: the Top Ontology
(TO). The TO consists of language-independent
features which may (or may not) be lexicalized
in various ways, or according to different
patterns, in different languages (Rodriguez et al.
1998). Via the LLI, all the concepts in the
monolingual wordnets are directly or indirectly
linked to the TO. The following picture shows
the EWN data structure (see also Vossen 1999):
While in WN all PoSs are represented, in EWN
detailed information was encoded only for nouns
and verbs and no analysis was carried out with
respect to lexical-semantic relations which could
be used to describe the semantics of adjectives
and adverbs. In an Italian National Project we
are building a large wordnet, ItalWordNet
(henceforth IWN)3, by extending the network
built for Italian in EWN. Thus, we are both
increasing the coverage for nouns and verbs and
adding adjectives and some adverbs4. To be able
to encode information on adjectives we have
enriched the set of the EWN lexical-semantic
relations, aiming at encoding data which can be
useful for computational applications. Moreover,
we have revised the TO in order to account for
the semantics of the new lexical categories being
encoded.
In this paper we describe the main changes made
to the EWN framework in order to encode
information on adjectives in IWN. Firstly, we
provide a brief overview of the WN treatment of
adjectives. Then, we discuss the set of relations
being encoded for this category in IWN. Finally,
we show the integration made to the EWN TO.
We then conclude the paper by adding some
remarks on the utility of the data being encoded
for computational applications.


1 Adjectives in WN


In WN adjectives are divided into two major
classes: descriptive adjectives and relational
adjectives. A descriptive adjective is &quot;one that
ascribes a value of an attribute to a noun&quot;
(Fellbaum et al. 1993:27). Descriptive adjectives
combine with nouns to express some qualities of
the thing, person or concept they designate.
Typically, in this group we find adjectives that
designate the physical dimension of an object,
its weight, abstract values etc. Besides these
referent-modifying adjectives, we also find
reference-modin,ing adjectives (cf. Bolinger
1967; Chierchia & McConnel-Ginet 1990 name
them intensional adjectives). Typical examples
of the latter are former, future, present.


3 ItalWordNet will be the reference lexical resource
among various integrated language resources and
software tools for the automatic treatment of the
Italian written and spoken language which are being
developed within the SI-TAL (Integrated System for
the Automatic Treatment of Language') National
Project.
4 Actually, we shall only encode adverbs derived
from adjectives by adding the suffix —mente, for
which a derivation relation with an adjective will be
encoded.


43


Relational adjectives, on the other hand, mean
something like &quot;relating/pertaining to, associated
with&quot;, and usually have a morphologically
strong link with a noun. Typical examples are
musical, atomic, chemical'.
Synonymy is the basic relation encoded for all
the PoSs (since it is used to build synsets).
While in WN the noun and verb networks are
then mainly developed around the superordinate
(hyper/hyponymy) relationship, the organization
of descriptive adjectives can &quot;be visualized in
terms of barbell-like structures, with a direct
antonym in the centre of each disk surrounded
by its semantically similar adjectives (which
constitute the indirect antonyms of the adjectives
in the opposed disk)&quot; (Fellbaum 1998a: 212).
The main relation encoded for these adjective
synsets is antonymy, claimed to be the most
prominent relation, both from a psycholinguistic
point of view and from a more strictly lexicalsemantic one, in the definition of the semantics
of descriptive adjectives. Hyponymy is
substituted by a 'similarity' relation.
Relational adjectives, on the contrary, are not
organized in this way, because their semantics
cannot be described by using these relations.
Indeed, they only point to the noun to which
they pertain (e.g. atomic is linked to atom).
Finally, information on the selectional
preferences of both descriptive and relational
adjectives is sometimes encoded (e.g., between
high and degree), by using an `is_attribute_of
relation.
2 The IWN relations for adjectives
As for the other lexical categories, also in IWN
the basic relation encoded for adjectives is
synonymy, on the basis of which synsets are
built. Following EWN, we also encode a
NEAR SYNONYMY relation when two synsets are
very close in meaning but their members cannot
be put in the same synset (and no other relation
results appropriate to link them; see Alonge et
5 Note that some adjectives have both a descriptive
sense and a relational one. For example, musicale
(musical) can modify the noun voce (voice) when we
want to say that a voice is sweet-sounding and
melodious, but can also be combined with the noun
strumento (instrument) when we want to indicate that
an instrument can be used to produce music.
al. 1998 for a discussion of this relation, and
Alonge et al., in prep., for a complete and
detailed discussion of the linguistic design of
IWN). Then, we encode a number of additional
relations, which have been identified by taking
into consideration i) theoretical works; ii) the
EAGLES recommendations on semantic
encoding (cf. Sanfilippo et al. 1999); iii) the data
available in our sources; iv) possible use of data
encoded in computational applications.


2.1 Hyponymy


Together with synonymy, the hyponymy relation
constitutes the 'bone structure' of both WN and
EWN. However, as we have seen, in WN the
possibility of encoding hyponymy for adjectives
is denied and the basic relation encoded for
adjectives is antonymy, while EWN did not
really deal with adjectives and a complete
network for them was not built.
Within IWN we have reconsidered the
possibility of encoding hyponymy for adjectives.
By analysing data coming from machinereadable dictionaries we find subsets of
adjectives which have a genus + differentia
definition, like nouns or verbs. That is, these
adjectives seem to be organised into classes
sharing a superordinate. This is the case, e.g., of
adjectives indicating a 'containing' property
(acquoso - watery; alcalino - alkaline), or a
'suitable-for' property (difensivo - defensive;
educativo - educational), etc. In IWN we have
decided, therefore, to encode hyponymy also for
these sets of adjectives. The taxonomies which
can be built on the basis of this relation are
different from those built for nouns or verbs,
since they are generally very flat, consisting
almost always of two levels only (an exception
is the color adjectives taxonomy). However, by
encoding a hyponymy relation for these
adjectives, we obtain classes for which it will be
possible to make various inferences. For
instance, it will be possible to infer semantic
preferences of certain classes: e.g., all the
adjectives occurring in the taxonomy of
contenente (containing) will occur as attributes
of concrete nouns; adjectives found in the
taxonomy of affetto (affected by an illness) will
never be predicated of nouns referring to
objects, etc. Furthermore, it will also be possible
to infer information on syntactic characteristics


44


of adjectives found in the same taxonomy: e.g.,
the hyponyms of atto (suitable for) are always
found in predicative position (and do not accept
any complements); the hyponyms of privo
(lacking) may occur both in attributive and in
predicative position (and may take certain
prepositional complements), etc.
As it was done for all the relations identified in
EWN, we have built substition tests or
diagnostic frames based on normality
judgements (cf. Cruse 1986). Inserting two
words in the test sentences built evokes a
'normality'! 'abnormality' judgement on the
basis of which each relation can be determined.
These tests are used by encoders both to verify
the existence of relations between synsets and to
encode them in a consistent way (for a complete
lists of the tests built see Alonge et al., in prep.)


2.2 Antonymy


As in WN, also in IWN the antonymy relation
remains an important relation to describe the
semantics of various adjectives. Following
theoretical work (Lyons 1977; Cruse 1986), we
have further distinguished between
COMPLEMENTARY ANTONYMY and GRADABLE_
ANTONYMY6. The former relation links
adjectives referring to opposing properties/
concepts: when one holds the other is excluded
(alive/dead). The latter relation is used for those
antonym pairs which refer to gradable properties
(long/short). In case it is not clear if two
opposing adjectives refer to complementary or
gradable properties, we can still use an
underspecified ANTONYMY relation. Also this
information can be useful for computational
applications since word pairs presenting one of
the two kinds of opposition may occur in
different contexts (cf. Cruse 1986).


2.3 Other relations


In WN a relation between adjectives and nouns
is encoded for relational adjectives which point
to a noun to which they 'pertain': atomic/atom,
6 A similar distinction is also made within the
SIMPLE EC project (LE-8346), whose goal is adding
semantic information to the set of harmonized
lexicons built within the PAROLE project for twelve
European languages. Of course, the sub-classification
of antonymy can also be used for nouns and verbs.
industrial/industry, etc. This relation will be
encoded also in IWN, by using the label


PERTAINS TO.


Another relation 'inherited' from WN can be
useful to distinguish both adjective senses and
their semantic preferences7:


alto, (tall) IS_A_VALUE_OF statura (stature)
alto2 (high) IS_A_VALUE_OF altezza (height).


Other relations are then being encoded which are
not in WN, but are encoded for nouns and verbs
in EWN. In WN each PoS forms a separate
system of language-internal relations and
conceptually close concepts are totally separated
only because they differ in PoS. In EWN, instead
of using as main classificatory criterion the
traditional distinction among PoSs, drawn upon
heterogeneous criteria, a purely semantic
distinction was adopted (following Lyons 1977).
Thus, a distinction was drawn among iorder
entities (1 oes - referred to by concrete nouns),
2nd order entities (2oes - referred to by verbs,
adjectives or nouns indicating properties, states,
processes or events), and rd order entities (3oes
- referred to by abstract nouns indicating
propositions existing independently of time and
space). By drawing this distinction it was
possible to relate lexical items that, either within
a language or across different languages, refer to
close concepts, although they belong to different
PoSs. Thus, as said above, the possibility to
encode 'near-synonymy' between synsets of the
same order (but different PoSs) was provided.
Furthermore, other cross-PoS relations were
identified which allow to obtain a better
description of word meanings. In IWN we
maintain the same distinction among semantic
orders and encode for adjectives some relations
which can be encoded for the other 2oes. In
particular, we encode the 'INVOLVED' and
'CAUSE' relations.
The INVOLVED relation links a 2oes with a be
or 3oe referring to a concept incorporated within
7 Furthermore, these relations being encoded between
an adjectival synset and a nominal or verbal one are
also useful to distinguish adjective classes as
described by Dixon (1991), and reported in
Sanfilippo et al. (1999). Indeed, such classes are
often indicated by the nouns linked to adjectives.


45


the meaning of the 2oe8. Examples for adjectives
are given in the following:


filoso (= pieno di flu) (thready, filamentous)
HAS_HYPERONYM pieno (full)
INVOLVED filo (thread)
imberbe privo di barba) (beardless)
HAS_HYPERONYM privo (lacking)
INVOLVED barba (beard).
Another relation which can be encoded is the
CAUSE relation:
depuratorio (= atto a depurare) (depurative,
purifying)
HAS_HYPERONYM atto, adatto
(suitable for)
CAUSES non-factive9 depurare
(to purify)
compensativo che serve a compensare)
(compensatory)
HAS_HYPERONYM atto, adatto
(suitable for)
CAUSES non-factive compensare
(to compensate)


A new relation, not present either in WN or in
EWN, will be encoded for a class of adjectives
indicating the possibility of some events
occurring:
giudicabile (= che puo essere giudicato) (triable)
LIABLE_TO giudicare (to judge)
inaccostabile, inavvicinabile (= che non pia essere
avvicinato) (which cannot be approached)
LIABLE_TO avvicinare, accostare
(to approach) negative.
8 E.g., to lapidate has as INVOLVEDINSTRUMENT
stone; to work has as INVOLVED_AGENT worker (see
Alonge et al. 1998).
9 As said above, in EWN various features were
encoded to make implications of relations explicit:
conjunction and disjunction (for multiple relations of
the same kind encoded for a synset); non-factivity (to
indicate that a causal relation does not necessarily
apply); intention (added to a cause relation to indicate
intention to cause a certain result); negation (to
explicitly encode the impossibility of a relation
occurring). These features are also used in IWN.
The table below gives an overview of the main
relations being encoded for adjectives in IWN
(for the other relations being encoded for
adjectives see Alonge et al., in prep.):

3 The IWN Top Ontology


In the EWN TO all the entities belonging to the
Tid order have been organized into two different
classification schemes, which represent the first
division below 2nd Order Entity:


• Situation Type: the event-structure or
Aktionsart (or lexical aspect) of a situation;
• Situation Components: the most salient
semantic components that characterize
situations.


The Situation Types provide a classification of
2oes in terms of the event-structure (or
Aktionsart) of the situation they refer to: a basic
distinction was drawn between Static and
Dynamic. The Situation Components represent a
more conceptual and intuitive classification of
word meanings because they can be viewed like
the most salient semantic components of a
concept. Examples of Situation Components
are: Manner, Existence, Communication, Cause.
Situation Type represents disjoint features that
cannot be combined, whereas it is possible to
assign any combination of Situation
Components to a word meaning. Here below the
Top Concepts identified for 2oes are shown:


46


2N° ORDER ENTITY
SITUATION COMPONENT
Cause
Communication
Condition
Existence
Experience
Location
Manner
Mental
Modal
Physical
Possession
Purpose
Quantity
Social
Time
SITUATION TYPE
Dynamic
BoundedEvent
UnboundedEvent
Static
Property
Relation


In order to be able to draw generalizations on
adjective meanings by using the TO, we
partially modified this scheme. First of all, we
moved the PROPERTY and RELATION nodes
under the SITUATION COMPONENT node. This
was done for two interconnected reasons: first of
all, because this distinction is not directly linked
to Aktionsart (lexical aspect), while the
distinctions under SITUATION TYPE are
Aktionsart distinctions, i.e. they are connected
with the &quot;the procedural characteristics (i.e. the
'phasal structure', 'time extension' and 'manner
of development') ascribed to any given situation
referred to by a verb phrase&quot; (Bache 1982: 70)1°.
Secondly, adjectives may refer to PROPERTIES or
RELATIONS, but they may be either stative or not
(cfr. e.g. Lakoff 1966; Quirk et al. 1985; Peters
et al. 1999). Thus, in our system it has to be
possible to specify that an adjective expresses a
PROPERTY while being DYNAMIC. In any case,
since many adjectives may have both a
DYNAMIC sense and a STATIC one, we have also
the possibility to under-specify this information


1° Of course, in EWN all 2oes (and therefore also
nouns or adjectives) can be classified according to
their Aktionsart.


by linking adjectives directly to the SITUATION
TYPE node.
Adjectives may indicate many different types of
properties: temporal (passeggiata mattutina morning walk), psychological (canzone triste sad song), social (uomo ricco - rich man),
physical (superficie legnosa - wooden surface),
physiological (bambino magro - thin child),
perceptive (minestra calda - hot soup),
quantitative (magra ricompensa - poor reward)
and intensity properties (vino forte - strong
wine). In the EWN TO there are already nodes
which may be used to represent these
distinctions (TIME, MENTAL, SOCIAL, PHYSICAL,
QUANTITY) but we needed to better specify or
also add some features. For example, we have
added, under the already present node
PHYSICAL, the node MATERIAL, to represent,
among others, some Italian adjectives ending in
—oso (for example legnoso - wooden, acquoso watery) which indicate the property of
containing a certain material. Moreover, we
added the node PHYSIOLOGICAL (to classify
adjectives corresponding to tired, hungry, sick,
etc.) under PHYSICAL. For adjectives denoting an
intensity, we then added the node INTENSITY
directly under the SITUATION COMPONENT node.
One of the main problem we had was that no
Top Concept in the EWN TO could be used to
classify the reference-modifying adjectives (cf.
above). These are a very particular kind of
adjectives, because they do not indicate a
property of the referent of the noun they modify.
So, aiming at showing the distinction between
referent-modifiers and reference-modifiers, we
created two new Top Concepts under the node
PROPERTY: ATTRIBUTE and FUNCTIONAL, where
the latter can be used for reference-modifying
adjectives (according to the definition provided
by Chierchia & McConnel-Ginet 1990 for the
category referred to by these adjectives: &quot;a
function from properties to properties&quot;).
Like all descriptive adjectives, also the
reference-modifiers classified under the node
FUNCTIONAL can be linked to other SITUATION
COMPONENTS. Functional adjectives for which
the temporal aspect prevails (ex - former,
presente - present) can be classified under the
node TIME; adjectives referring to some
'epistemological' property (potenziale potential, necessario - necessary) can be linked


47


to MODAL&quot;; etc. A particular case of functional
adjectives are the `argumental' ones. They
introduce a comparison between different
entities (e.g., simile - similar, diverso - different,
etc.). A comparison presupposes a relation
between different entities so these adjectives can
be linked to both PROPERTY and RELATION.
Since in the EWN TO these two Top Concepts
were two different kinds of SITUATION TYPE,
they were mutually exclusive; now, in the IWN
revised TO they can be conjoined.
Here below the IWN Top Concepts for 2nd Order
Entities are shown:

Concluding remarks


Although the ANTONYMY, PERTAINS_TO, and
IS_ATTRIBUTE_OF relations, already encoded in
the Princeton WN, are fundamental relations to
describe the adjective semantics, and they can be
' Since this node is used for situations involving the
possibility or likelihood of other situations.
useful for computational applications which
exploit our resource, we believe that the 'new'
relations being encoded may provide equally
relevant information, especially because many
adjectives cannot be defined by means of the
WN relations. Let's take into consideration just
a few examples.
The adjective depresso is ambiguous in that it
has (at least) three readings:
1) which has been lowered, flattened (said of a
land);
2) being in bad physical or moral conditions (said
of an area, a country);
3) affected by depression (said of a person).
For these three senses of the adjective we would
encode different relations, extractable from our
sources:


depressoi IS_CAUSED_BY deprimere (to lower)
IS_A_VALUE_OF terreno (land)
depresso2 HAS_HYPERONYM colpito (affected)
IS_CAUSED_BY depressionei
(depression - economic sense)
depresso3 HAS_HYPERONYM affetto
(affected, suffering from sthg.)


IS_CAUSED_BY depressione2
(depression - medical sense)


The relations encoded could, e.g., help
disambiguate the occurrences of the adjective in
contexts such as: Gianni era depresso (Gianni
was depressed) or Quella regione e depressa
(That area is depressed). Indeed, by checking the
semantic information encoded for the two senses
of depressione linked to depresso, it's possible
to provide the right interpretation for the
sentences under analysis; on the other hand, the
first sense of the adjective would be excluded
because of the IS_A_VALUE_OF relation
encoded. In this case, also the TO links could be
helpful: actually, depresso2 would be linked to
SOCIAL and CONDITION, while depresso3 would
be linked to MENTAL and EXPERIENCE.
Many adjectives found in our sources do not
seem to have (lexicalized) antonyms, nor cannot
be defined by using the PERTAINS_TO or
IS_A_VALUE_OF relations. These are often
linked to nouns or verbs, by various relations:


48


piumato = coperto di piume (plumed = covered with
plumage)
HAS_HYPERONYM coperto
INVOLVED piuma
distillabile = che pue essere distillato (distillable =
which can be distilled)
LIABLE_TO distillare.


For these and many other adjectives the 'new'
relations identified in 'INN are necessary, given
that we often cannot encode other relations for
them. The relations encoded provide
fundamental semantic information on them,
which can, for instance, be used to infer
semantic preferences (e.g., only certain 1 oes can
be modified by piumato, etc.). The inclusion of
this information in a large database which is
mainly intended for computational applications
can be very useful, mainly because it may help
in resolving ambiguities and may be used to
draw inferences of different nature.

The goal of this paper is to describe how the EuroWordNet framework for representing lexical meaning is being modified within an Italian National Project in order to include information on adjectives. The focus is on the 'new' semantic relations being encoded and on the revisions we have made to the EuroWordNet Top Ontology structure. We also briefly discuss the utility of the information which is being encoded for computational applications.

Alonge et al. 1998). The links among the wordnets of different languages were realized by means of an Interlingual-Index (ILI), constituted by an unstructured list of the Princeton WN (version 1.5) synsets. In addition, a hierarchy of language-independent concepts, reflecting fundamental semantic distinctions (e.g., Object and Substance, Dynamic and Static, Cause, Manner, etc.), was built: the Top Ontology (TO). The TO consists of language-independent features which may (or may not) be lexicalized in various ways, or according to different patterns, in different languages (Rodriguez et al. 1998).

These features are also used in IWN. The table below gives an overview of the main relations being encoded for adjectives in IWN (for the other relations being encoded

w generalizations on adjective meanings by using the TO, we partially modified this scheme. First of all, we moved the PROPERTY and RELATION nodes under the SITUATION COMPONENT node. This was done for two interconnected reasons: first of all, because this distinction is not directly linked to Aktionsart (lexical aspect), while the distinctions under SITUATION TYPE are Aktionsart distinctions, i.e. they are connected with the &quot;the procedural characteristics (i.e. the 'phasal structure', 'time extension' and 'manner of development') ascribed to any given situation referred to by a verb phrase&quot; (Bache 1982: 70)1°. Secondly, adjectives may refer to PROPERTIES or RELATIONS, but they may be either stative or not (cfr. e.g. Lakoff 1966; Quirk et al. 1985; Peters et al. 1999). Thus, in our system it has to be possible to specify that an adjective expresses a PROPERTY while being DYNAMIC. In any case, since many adjectives may have both a DYNAMIC sense and a STATIC one, we have also the possibility to under-specify this information 1° Of course, in EWN all 2oes (and therefore also nouns or adjectives) can be classified according to their Aktionsart. by linking adjectives directly to the SITUATION TYP

A descriptive adjective is &quot;one that ascribes a value of an attribute to a noun&quot; (Fellbaum et al. 1993:27). Descriptive adjectives combine with nouns to express some qualities of the thing, person or concept they designate. Typically, in this group we find adjectives that designate the physical dimension of an object, its weight, abstract values etc. Besides these referent-modifying adjectives, we also find reference-modin,ing adjectives (cf. Bolinger 1967; Chierchia & McConnel-Ginet 1990 name them intensional adjectives). Typical examples of the latter are former, future, present. 3 ItalWordNet will be the reference lexical resource among various integrated language resources and software tools for the automatic treatment of the Italian written and spoken language which are being developed within the SI-TAL (Integrated System for the Automatic Treatment of Language') National Project. 4 Actually, we shall only encode adverbs derived from adjectives by adding the suffix —mente, for which a derivation relation with an adjective will be encoded.

SITY directly under the SITUATION COMPONENT node. One of the main problem we had was that no Top Concept in the EWN TO could be used to classify the reference-modifying adjectives (cf. above). These are a very particular kind of adjectives, because they do not indicate a property of the referent of the noun they modify. So, aiming at showing the distinction between referent-modifiers and reference-modifiers, we created two new Top Concepts under the node PROPERTY: ATTRIBUTE and FUNCTIONAL, where the latter can be used for reference-modifying adjectives (according to the definition provided by Chierchia & McConnel-Ginet 1990 for the category referred to by these adjectives: &quot;a function from properties to properties&quot;). Like all descriptive adjectives, also the reference-modifiers classified under the node FUNCTIONAL can be linked to other SITUATION COMPONENTS. Functional adjectives for which the temporal aspect prevails (ex - former, presente - present) can be classified under the node TIME; adjectives referring to some 'epistemological' property (potenziale - potential, necessario - necessary) can be linked 47 to MODAL&quot;; etc. A particular case of functional adjectives are the `argumental' ones.

Cruse 1986). Inserting two words in the test sentences built evokes a 'normality'! 'abnormality' judgement on the basis of which each relation can be determined. These tests are used by encoders both to verify the existence of relations between synsets and to encode them in a consistent way (for a complete lists of the tests built see Alonge et al., in prep.) 2.2 Antonymy As in WN, also in IWN the antonymy relation remains an important relation to describe the semantics of various adjectives.

In IWN we maintain the same distinction among semantic orders and encode for adjectives some relations which can be encoded for the other 2oes. In particular, we encode the 'INVOLVED' and 'CAUSE' relations. The INVOLVED relation links a 2oes with a be or 3oe referring to a concept incorporated within 7 Furthermore, these relations being encoded between an adjectival synset and a nominal or verbal one are also useful to distinguish adjective classes as described by Dixon (1991), and reported in Sanfilippo et al.

Introduction The Princeton WordNet (henceforth WN) is a lexical semantic network in which the meanings of words are represented in terms of their conceptual and lexical relations to other words.

 substition tests or diagnostic frames based on normality judgements (cf. Cruse 1986). Inserting two words in the test sentences built evokes a 'normality'! 'abnormality' judgement on the basis of which each relation can be determined. These tests are used by encoders both to verify the existence of relations between synsets and to encode them in a consistent way (for a complete lists of the tests built see Alonge et al., in prep.) 2.2 Antonymy As in WN, also in IWN the antonymy relation remains an important relation to describe the semantics of various adjectives. Following theoretical work (Lyons 1977; Cruse 1986), we have further distinguished between COMPLEMENTARY ANTONYMY and GRADABLE_ ANTONYMY6. The former relation links adjectives referring to opposing properties/ concepts: when one holds the other is excluded (alive/dead). The latter relation is used for those antonym pairs which refer to gradable properties (long/short). In case it is not clear if two opposing adjectives refer to complementary or gradable properties, we can still use an underspecified ANTONYMY relation. Also this information can be useful for computational applications since word pairs presenting one of the two kind
inguish both adjective senses and their semantic preferences7: alto, (tall) IS_A_VALUE_OF statura (stature) alto2 (high) IS_A_VALUE_OF altezza (height). Other relations are then being encoded which are not in WN, but are encoded for nouns and verbs in EWN. In WN each PoS forms a separate system of language-internal relations and conceptually close concepts are totally separated only because they differ in PoS. In EWN, instead of using as main classificatory criterion the traditional distinction among PoSs, drawn upon heterogeneous criteria, a purely semantic distinction was adopted (following Lyons 1977). Thus, a distinction was drawn among iorder entities (1 oes - referred to by concrete nouns), 2nd order entities (2oes - referred to by verbs, adjectives or nouns indicating properties, states, processes or events), and rd order entities (3oes - referred to by abstract nouns indicating propositions existing independently of time and space). By drawing this distinction it was possible to relate lexical items that, either within a language or across different languages, refer to close concepts, although they belong to different PoSs. Thus, as said above, the possibility to encode 'near-synonymy

For example, musicale (musical) can modify the noun voce (voice) when we want to say that a voice is sweet-sounding and melodious, but can also be combined with the noun strumento (instrument) when we want to indicate that an instrument can be used to produce music. al. 1998 for a discussion of this relation, and Alonge et al., in prep., for a complete and detailed discussion of the linguistic design of IWN). Then, we encode a number of additional relations, which have been identified by taking into consideration i) theoretical works; ii) the EAGLES recommendations on semantic encoding (cf. Sanfilippo et al. 1999); iii) the data available in our sources; iv) possible use of data encoded in computational applications. 2.1 Hyponymy Together with synonymy, the hyponymy relation constitutes the 'bone structure' of both WN and EWN. However, as we have seen, in WN the possibility of encoding hyponymy for adjectives is denied and the basic relation encoded for adjectives is antonymy, while EWN did not really deal with adjectives and a complete network for them was not built. Within IWN we have reconsidered the possibility of encoding hyponymy for adjectives. By analysing data coming from machinereadable dicti
her cross-PoS relations were identified which allow to obtain a better description of word meanings. In IWN we maintain the same distinction among semantic orders and encode for adjectives some relations which can be encoded for the other 2oes. In particular, we encode the 'INVOLVED' and 'CAUSE' relations. The INVOLVED relation links a 2oes with a be or 3oe referring to a concept incorporated within 7 Furthermore, these relations being encoded between an adjectival synset and a nominal or verbal one are also useful to distinguish adjective classes as described by Dixon (1991), and reported in Sanfilippo et al. (1999). Indeed, such classes are often indicated by the nouns linked to adjectives. 45 the meaning of the 2oe8. Examples for adjectives are given in the following: filoso (= pieno di flu) (thready, filamentous) HAS_HYPERONYM pieno (full) INVOLVED filo (thread) imberbe privo di barba) (beardless) HAS_HYPERONYM privo (lacking) INVOLVED barba (beard). Another relation which can be encoded is the CAUSE relation: depuratorio (= atto a depurare) (depurative, purifying) HAS_HYPERONYM atto, adatto (suitable for) CAUSES non-factive9 depurare (to purify) compensativo che serve a compensare) (compensatory) HAS
