Among researchers interested in computational models of discourse, there has been a long-standing
debate between proponents of approaches based on domain-independent rhetorical relations, and
those who subscribe to approaches based on intentionality. In this paper, we argue that the main
theories representing these two approaches, RST (Mann and Thompson 1988) and G&amp;S (Grosz
and Sidner 1986), make similar claims about how speakers&apos; intentions determine a structure of
their discourse. The similarity occurs because the nucleus-satellite relation among text spans in
RST corresponds to the dominance relation among intentions in G&amp;S. Building on this similarity,
we sketch a partial mapping between the two theories to show that the main points of the two
theories are equivalent. Furthermore, the additional claims found in only RST or only G&amp;S are
largely consistent. The issue of what structure is determined by semantic (domain) relations in
the discourse and how this structure might be related to the intentional structure is discussed. We
suggest the synthesis of the two theories would be useful to researchers in both natural language
interpretation and generation.

Within the computational discourse community, there is a long-standing debate be-
tween proponents of theories based on domain-independent rhetorical relations (most
notably Rhetorical Structure Theory, Mann and Thompson 1988, henceforth RST; see
also Hobbs 1985) and those who subscribe to theories based on intentionality (most
notably that of Grosz and Sidner 1986, henceforth G&amp;S). While some researchers have
tried to integrate the two approaches (Moore and Paris 1993; Asher and Lascarides
1994; Hobbs 1993), the two are usually viewed as competing theories. Here we ar-
gue that G&amp;S and RST are essentially similar in what they say about how speakers&apos;
intentions determine a structure of their discourse.
Intentional structure describes the roles that discourse actions play in the speaker&apos;s
communicative plan to achieve desired effects on the hearer&apos;s mental state. Intentions
encode what the speaker was trying to accomplish with a given portion of discourse.
The relations between intentions indicate whether one intention contributes to the sat-
isfaction of another (dominance) or whether one intention must be satisfied before
another (satisfaction-precedence) (Grosz and Sidner 1986). In contrast, informational
structure is concerned with domain relations among the things being talked about.
Moore and Pollack (1992) argue that both intentional and informational analyses are
needed simultaneously.

Prior research has established that recognition of intentional structure, and there-
fore appropriate generation of cues to such structure, is crucial for many discourse-
processing tasks. Grosz and Sidner (1986) argued that intentional structure is crucial
for anaphora resolution and plan recognition. Hirschberg et al. (1987) show that inten-
tional structure plays a role in intonation. In addition, Moore (1995, in press) shows
that intentional structure is crucial for responding effectively to questions that refer
to prior discourse and to communication failures. Further research indicates that in-
tentional structure is an important factor in determining when to generate discourse
cues (e.g., &amp;quot;because,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;thus,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;although&amp;quot;), which discourse cues to select, and where
to place those cues (Moser and Moore 1995, in preparation).
In this paper, we compare what G&amp;S and RST say about intentional structure.
We use the term Intentional Linguistic Structure, or ILS, as a theory-neutral way
of referring to the structure of a discourse determined by the speaker&apos;s intentions.
The definition of ILS comprises one of the major claims in G&amp;S. ILS is not directly
addressed in RST, but is implicit in the RST concept of nuclearity. We argue that
the key to reconciling ILS in the two theories lies in the correspondence between
the dominance relation between intentions in G&amp;S and the nucleus:satellite relation
between text spans in RST. Roughly speaking, an RST nucleus expresses a G&amp;S in-
tention I„, a satellite expresses another intention Is and, in G&amp;S terms, I, dominates
I. The correspondence between G&amp;S dominance and RST nuclearity helps to clarify
the relationship between ILS and informational structure, the structure determined
by underlying semantic (domain) relations. In particular, the undesirable possibility
that informational structure could be incompatible with intentional structure (Moore
and Pollack 1992) is explained. Further, we argue that a synthesis of G&amp;S and RST is
possible because the correspondence between dominance and nuclearity forms a great
deal of common ground, and because the remaining claims in the two theories are
consistent.

2. Intentional Linguistic Structure in G&amp;S
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998233571428571">
G&amp;S is formulated in terms of the interdependence of three distinct structures. Of
the three structures, it is the effect of intentional structure on linguistic structure that
concerns us in this paper. This effect is an explicit claim about ILS.
In G&amp;S, the intentional structure consists of the set of the speaker&apos;s communicative
intentions throughout the discourse, and the relations of dominance and satisfaction-
precedence among these intentions. The speaker tries to realize each intention by say-
ing something; i.e., each intention is the purpose behind one or more of the speaker&apos;s
utterances. Intentions are thus an extension of the intentions in Grice&apos;s (1957) theory
of utterance meaning. Speakers intend for the intentions behind their utterances to be
recognized and for that recognition to be part of what makes their utterances effective.
A purpose I„, dominates another purpose I, when satisfying I, is part of satisfying
I. A purpose L, satisfaction-precedes another purpose L, when In must be satisfied
first. The dominance and satisfaction-precedence relations impose a structure on the
set of the speaker&apos;s intentions, the intentional structure of the discourse, and this in
turn determines the linguistic structure.
The linguistic structure of a particular discourse is made up of segments, which
are sets of utterances, related by embeddedness and sequential order. A segment DS„
originates with the speaker&apos;s intention: it is exactly those utterances that the speaker
produces in order to satisfy a communicative intention I in the intentional structure.
In other words, I„ is the discourse segment purpose (DSP) of DS,. DS„ is embed-
ded in another segment DS„, just when the purposes of the two segments are in the

For G&amp;S, dominance in intentional structure determines embedding in linguistic structure.
dominance relation, i.e., In, dominates L. The dominance relation among intentions
fully determines the embeddedness relations of the discourse segments that realize
them. For example, consider the discourse shown in Figure 1, adapted from Mann
and Thompson (1988). The whole discourse is a segment, DS0, that attempts to realize
10, the speaker&apos;s intention for the hearer to adopt the intention of attending the ballet.&apos;
As part of her plan to achieve Io, the speaker generates I, the intention for the hearer
to adopt the belief that the ballet will be very entertaining. Then, as part of her plan
to achieve Ii, the speaker generates 12, the intention that the hearer believe that the
show is made up of all new choreography. As shown on the left in Figure 1, 10 domi-
nates II, which in turn dominates 12. Due to these dominance relations, the discourse
segment that realizes 12 is embedded in the discourse segment for II, which is in turn
embedded within the discourse segment for To. as shown on the right in the figure.
The dominance of intentions directly determines embedding of segments.
When one DSP Li satisfaction-precedes another Li, then DS„ precedes DS„, in the
discourse. The satisfaction-precedes relation among intentions constrains the order of
segments in the discourse, but it does not fully determine it. In the example in Figure 1,
none of the intentions satisfaction-precedes the others.
Here we introduce a concept which is not part of the G&amp;S theory, but which will
be important to our discussion below. We coin the term core to refer to that part of the
segment that expresses the segment purpose. A segment may contain individual utter-
ances as well as embedded segments. Most likely, the core of the segment is found in
these unembedded utterances. In the example, (a) is the core of DS°, (b) the core of DS1
and (c) the core of DS2. As will be discussed, a core functions to manifest the purpose
of the segment, while the embedded segments serve to help achieve that purpose. The
defining feature of the core is its function of expressing the purpose of the segment.
While the core&apos;s position in the G&amp;S linguistic structure is most likely an unembedded
utterance, it is also possible that the core could be an embedded segment. This could
occur when the expression of the segment purpose is more elaborate than simply stat-
ing what the hearer should do or believe. To simplify our discussion, however, we
assume the core of a segment is an utterance not embedded in any subsegment.
It should be clear that the theory-independent notion of ILS as it was character-
ized above is exactly the linguistic structure in G&amp;S. ILS is something G&amp;S makes
explicit claims about. By choosing to modify the terminology from simply &amp;quot;linguistic

notation of G&amp;S.

structure&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;intentional linguistic structure,&amp;quot; we mean to suggest that consideration
of something other than speaker intentions—for example, semantic relations—could
determine another kind of structure to the discourse. Clearly, the semantic (or infor-
mational) relations among discourse entities can in principle be the determinant of a
separate linguistic structure. Whether or not such an informational structure is use-
ful or is related in an interesting way to ILS is a question requiring further research.
We discuss the relationship between ILS and possible approaches to informational
structure briefly in Section 5.

3. Intentional Linguistic Structure in RST
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950256410256">
In contrast to its explicitness in G&amp;S, ILS is only implicit in RST. To identify the
implicit claims about ILS, we must first identify the components of an RST analysis
that involve a judgement about the relation between intentions underlying text spans.
The range of possible RST text structures is defined by a set of schemas, which
describe the structural arrangement of spans, or text constituents. Schemas are basic
structural units or patterns in the application of RST relations. There are five schema
patterns, each consisting of two or more spans, a specification of each span as either
nucleus or satellite, and a specification of the RST relation(s) that exist between these
spans. In this paper, we focus on the most commonly occurring RST schema, which
consists of two text spans (a nucleus and a satellite) and a single RST relation that
holds between them. The nucleus is defined as the element that is &amp;quot;more essential
to the speaker&apos;s purpose,&amp;quot; while the satellite is functionally dependent on the nu-
cleus and could be replaced with a different satellite without changing the function
of the schema. As we argue below, this functional distinction between nucleus and
satellite is an implicit claim about ILS, and is a crucial notion in understanding the
correspondence between RST and G&amp;S.
A schema application describes the structure of a larger span of text in terms of
multiple constituent spans. Each of the constituent spans may in turn have a structure
of subconstituent spans. Thus, the application of RST schemas in the analysis of a
text is recursive, i.e., one schema application may be embedded in another. To be an
acceptable RST analysis, there must be one schema application under which the entire
text is subsumed and which accounts for all minimal units, usually clauses, of the
text. In addition, each minimal unit can appear in exactly one schema application, and
the spans constituting each schema application must be adjacent in the text. These
constraints guarantee that a correct RST analysis will form a tree structure.
An instantiated schema specifies the RST relation(s) between its constituent spans.
Each relation is defined in terms of a set of constraints on the nucleus, the satellite,
and the nucleus-satellite combination, as well as a specification of the effect that the
speaker is attempting to achieve on the hearer&apos;s beliefs or inclinations. An RST analyst
must judge which schema consists of RST relation definitions whose constraints and
effects best describe the nucleus and satellite spans in the schema application. Mann
and Thompson claimed that, for each two consecutive spans in a coherent discourse, a
single RST relation will be primary. For reasons discussed in Section 5.1, we consider
only the RST presentational relations, or what Moore and Pollack (1992) call intentional
relations, in identifying the ILS claims of RST.
To illustrate how a speaker&apos;s intentions determine discourse structure in this the-
ory, consider the RST analysis of the example discourse from Figure 1. As shown in
Figure 2, at the top level, the text is broken down into two spans: (a) and (b-c). The
span (b-c) forms a satellite that stands in a motivation relation to (a). This span can

be further broken down into the two minimal units (b) and (c), where (c) is a satellite
that stands in an evidence relation to (b).2
While there is no direct representation of intentions in RST, the asymmetry be-
tween a nucleus and its satellite originates with the speaker&apos;s intentions. The nucleus
expresses a belief or action that the hearer is intended to adopt. The satellite provides
information that is intended to increase the hearer&apos;s belief in or desire to adopt the
nucleus. Implicitly, this is a claim that the text is structured by the speaker&apos;s intentions
and, more specifically, by the difference between the intention that the hearer adopt a
belief or desire expressed in a text span and the intention that a span contribute to this
adoption. In the example, the nucleus (a) expresses an action that the speaker intends
the hearer to adopt. The satellite (b-c) is intended to facilitate this adoption by pro-
viding the hearer with a motivation for doing the suggested action. In the embedded
span, the nucleus (b) expresses a belief that the speaker intends the hearer to adopt
and the satellite (c) is intended to facilitate this adoption by providing evidence for
the belief.
The second implicit RST claim about ILS is a refinement of the first. The intentional
relations specify the ways in which a speaker can affect the hearer&apos;s adoption of a
nucleus by including a satellite. That is, not only is there a functional distinction
between nucleus and satellites, there is also a classification of satellites according to
how they help achieve the hearer&apos;s adoption of the nucleus. Translating this into a
claim about ILS, text is structured by the ways in which some utterances are intended
to help other utterances achieve their purpose.

4. Correspondence between Dominance and Nuclearity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716428571429">
Now we are in a position to compare the explicit claims of G&amp;S about ILS with the
implicit ones of RST. Both theories agree that a discourse is structured into a hierarchy
of non-overlapping constituents, segments in G&amp;S and spans in RST. Each subcon-
stituent may in turn be structured in exactly the same way as the larger constituent.
Superficially, the similarity ends there because the internal structure of segments and
spans is different. In G&amp;S, the internal structure of a segment consists of any number
of embedded segments plus what we are calling the core, the (usually unembedded)

2 As discussed in Mann and Thompson (1988), a motivation relation occurs when a speaker intends the
satellite to increase the hearer&apos;s desire to perform the action specified in the nucleus. An evidence
relation occurs when a speaker intends the satellite to increase the hearer&apos;s belief in the nucleus.

utterances that express the discourse segment purpose. In RST, the internal structure
of a span consists of a nucleus, which we have characterized as expressing a belief or
action the hearer is intended to adopt, a satellite, which is intended to facilitate that
adoption, and an intentional relation between the nucleus and satellite.
If we look more closely at the correspondence between dominance and nuclearity,
we find that the structure of spans and segments is nearly identical. Specifically, an
embedded segment corresponds to a satellite, and the core corresponds to the nucleus.
Or, because G&amp;S do not have the notion of core in their theory, a more accurate char-
acterization of the correspondence would be that the nucleus manifests a dominating
intention, while a satellite manifests a dominated intention. That is, dominance in G&amp;S
corresponds closely to nuclearity in RST. There is a relationship, which we can crudely
characterize as that of linguistic manifestation, that links the nucleus to a dominating
intention and a satellite to a dominated intention. Exactly how to derive a commu-
nicative intention from an utterance, and vice versa, is one of the main research issues
in computational linguistics. Here we simply assume that an utterance conveys either
a belief or an action p and thereby makes manifest the speaker&apos;s intention that the
hearer adopt belief in or an intention to perform p.
The correspondence suggests a mapping between G&amp;S linguistic structure and
RST text structure. An embedded segment in G&amp;S will be analyzed as a satellite in
RST, and the segment core will be the nucleus. When there are multiple embedded
segments in G&amp;S, each subsegment will be analyzed as an RST satellite. In these cases
of multiple subsegments, the RST structure will depend on whether the RST relations
are the same or different. The entire segment may be a single RST span with the G&amp;S
core as nucleus and each subsegment as a satellite of that nucleus. This occurs when
the multiple satellites bear the same RST relation to the nucleus. Alternatively, the G&amp;S
core and an adjacent subsegment may be analyzed as an RST nucleus and satellite,
forming an RST span. This span is then the nucleus of a higher span in which the
satellite is an additional G&amp;S subsegment from the same segment. This occurs when
the multiple satellites bear different relations to their nucleus.
Because cores are a central aspect of the mapping between the two theories, and
because cores are not part of the G&amp;S proposal, it is natural to ask whether a segment
necessarily has a core. Given the nature of segment purposes, a coreless segment
seems intuitively unlikely. Recall that segment purposes, like the utterance intentions
discussed by Grice, have the property that they are intended to achieve their effect
in part from being recognized. The core has an important function: it manifests the
purpose of the segment. Without a core, the segment purpose must be inferred from
the subsegments alone. In such a case, the speaker intends that the hearer recognize
a purpose, but does not supply an utterance that manifests that purpose.
The question of whether or not coreless segments actually occur, however, is best
answered by corpus analysis rather than theorizing. For our present purposes, we
wish to consider the possibility of a coreless segment only because such a segment
would complicate the mapping between the two theories presented above. In G&amp;S,
the definition of linguistic structure does not require a segment to contain a core. In
the RST schemas considered thus far, a span always consists of a nucleus and satellite.
A less common schema pattern, known as the joint schema, contains multiple spans
with no nucleus-satellite distinction among them joined into a single span. Should a
coreless segment occur in a G&amp;S analysis, it can be mapped to a joint schema in RST.
Building on the correspondence between dominance and nuclearity, we raise two
issues in the following sections. First, how do informational relations fit into the dis-
course structure? Second, what synthesis of the two theories emerges when we recog-
nize the correspondence?

<bodyText confidence="0.999980615384615">
Moore and Pollack (1992) argued that RST defines two types of relations: intentional
relations, which arise from the ways in which consecutive discourse elements par-
ticipate in the speaker&apos;s plan to affect the hearer&apos;s mental state, and informational
relations, which obtain between the content conveyed in consecutive elements of a co-
herent discourse. This is consistent with Mann and Thompson&apos;s (1988, 256) distinction
between &amp;quot;presentational&amp;quot; (intentional) and &amp;quot;subject matter&amp;quot; (informational) relations.
However, while Mann and Thompson maintain that for any two consecutive elements
of a coherent discourse, one rhetorical relation will be primary (i.e., related by an
informational or an intentional relation), Moore and Pollack showed that discourse
interpretation and generation require that intentional and informational analyses ex-
ist simultaneously. Thus, in addition to the Intentional Linguistic Structure discussed
so far, a discourse may simultaneously have an informational structure, imposed by
domain relations among the objects, states, and events being discussed.

In addition to their claim that intentional and informational analyses must co-exist,
Moore and Pollack presented an example in which the intentional and informational
relations can impose a different structure on the discourse. It is important to under-
stand, however, that their example shows that the discourse structure determined by
informational relations as defined in RST can be incompatible with the one determined
by intentional relations. Here we argue that the problem is due to the inclusion of nu-
clearity in the definition of RST subject matter (informational) relations. As shown in
Figure 3, the incompatibility arises because the nucleus and satellite of the intentional
relation may be inverted in the RST informational relation.&apos;

speaker intentions, corresponding to the G&amp;S relation of dominance among intentions.
That is, nuclearity rightly belongs in the definitions of intentional relations. In contrast,
informational relations, properly construed, should not distinguish between nucleus
and satellite in their definitions. As an example, consider the pair of RST relations
volitional-cause and volitional-result. The volitional-cause relation is defined as one
in which the nucleus presents a volitional action and the satellite presents a situation
that could have caused the agent to perform the action. The effect of this relation
is that the reader &amp;quot;recognizes the situation presented in the satellite as a cause of
the volitional action presented in the nucleus.&amp;quot; The volitional-result relation is nearly
identical except that the cause of the action is the nucleus and the result is the satellite.
Why does RST need two relations to capture this? The reason is that the same domain
relation, call it cause-effect, links a cause and effect regardless of which is the nucleus.
In Figure 4, note that, while (a) causes (b), either (a) or (b) can be the nucleus of the
relation. For a particular instance of a cause-effect in the domain, it is equally plausible
for a speaker to mention the effect to facilitate the hearer&apos;s adoption of belief in the
cause, as would be suggested by context I in Figure 4, or to mention the cause to
facilitate the hearer&apos;s adoption of belief in the effect, as suggested by context II.
Moreover, this is precisely what the intentional relations capture. By incorporat-
ing the nucleus-satellite distinction into the definitions of RST informational relations,
these relations include an implicit analysis of intentional structure. As a consequence,
strict application of the RST informational relations can result in a different structure
than that imposed by the intentional relations, and this is the source of the problem
noted by Moore and Pollack. Because nuclearity can only be determined by consid-
eration of intentions, and intentional and informational analyses of a discourse must
co-exist, we argue that the solution to the problem is to properly relegate informa-
tion about nuclearity (intention dominance) to the intentional analysis, and remove
it from definitions of informational relations. In this way, these two determinants of
discourse structure cannot conflict. In addition, note that this is preferable to adding
surplus informational relations to allow either relatum to be the nucleus (as was done
in the volitional-cause and volitional-result case) because (1) this obscures the fact that
relations such as volitional-cause and volitional-result appeal to the same underlying
domain relation and (2) the proliferation of relations weakens the restrictive power of
the framework.

relations across utterances be analyzed in the informational structure? What patterns
of informational relations are employed in realizing various kinds of intentions, and
what analysis provides a reliable means for identifying such patterns? Final answers to
these questions require further research. Because constraints may be needed in order
to make progress on these issues, we point out two approaches to constraining the
definition of informational structure. In Section 6.2 we suggest that RST informational
relations provide a version of one of these approaches.
The most inclusive definition of informational structure would contain all the
domain relations between the things being talked about. Included would be causal
relations of various sorts, set relations, relations underlying bridging inferences (Clark
and Haviland 1977), and the relation of identity between domain objects underly-
ing coreference of noun phrases across utterances. By this definition, informational
structure is a complex network of domain relations that is defined independently of
the intentional structure. Keeping track of all domain relations in a discourse is an
overwhelming task and is often infeasible. One approach to constraining informa-
tional structure is to define it as parasitic on intentional structure. The informational
structure would contain an accompanying informational relation for each intentional
relation. A second approach to constraining informational structure is to define it as
a network of domain relations with type restrictions on the relata. The informational
structure would contain only the relations among situations, events, and actions, that
is, the types of entities referred to by clauses.

The discussion in Section 4 suggests that RST and G&amp;S share a large amount of com-
mon ground. That is, many of the claims in the two theories, although formulated
differently, are essentially equivalent. To begin this section, we state the common
ground that emerges from relating dominance and nuclearity. Then we briefly re-
view the claims of each theory that are outside this common ground. Each theory has
some consistent ground, additional claims that concern issues simply not addressed
by the other theory. The actual contentious ground, claims made by one theory that
are incompatible with the other, is quite small.

6.1 Common Ground
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997606875">
Building on the correspondence between dominance and nuclearity, a partial synthesis
of G&amp;S and RST would be roughly the following: A segment/span arises because its
speaker is attempting to achieve a communicative purpose. Such purposes have the
feature that they are achieved in part by being recognized by hearers. Thus, the plan
for achieving the purpose typically has two distinct parts: (1) one or more utterances
that serve to make the purpose manifest by expressing a belief or action for the hearer
to adopt (the core/nucleus) and (2) a set of subparts that contribute to achieving
the purpose by manifesting subpurposes dominated by that purpose (the embedded
segments/satellites).
Note that this synthesis encompasses the ILS claims of both theories regarding
the example discourse in Figure 1. DS° is a segment/span designed to achieve the
purpose L. The plan for achieving Io is to first manifest 10 by expressing the action in
(a), the core/nucleus, and then to contribute to the achievement of I() by providing the
motivation in (b-c), the embedded segment/satellite. In turn, DS1 is a segment/span
designed to achieve the purpose II by first manifesting II in the expression of the
core/nucleus (b) and then providing evidence in the embedded segment/satellite (c).

6.2 Consistent Ground
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990379310345">
RST and G&amp;S each makes claims about issues not addressed by the other theory. We
review these claims briefly in order to establish that they are consistent.
First, the two theories offer different but consistent perspectives on the ordering
of segments/spans. In G&amp;S, intentions may be related by satisfaction-precedence in
addition to dominance. One intention satisfaction-precedes another when it must be
realized before the other. This relation between intentions partially constrains the order
of what is said and thus introduces a distinction between necessary order, originat-
ing with a satisfaction-precedence relation of the underlying intentions, and artifac-
tual order, additional ordering that must be imposed to produce linearized text. G&amp;S
makes no claim about the relative ordering between a core and embedded segments.
In RST, because the underlying intentions are not analyzed explicitly, the distinction
between necessary and artifactual order is not available. Instead, the relative order-
ing of core /nucleus and embedded segment/satellite is highlighted. RST&apos;s authors
claim that many relations have a typical ordering of their nucleus and satellite. The
two theories address different aspects of ordering without suggesting any points of
contention.
Second, in addition to intentional and linguistic structure, G&amp;S posits an atten-
tional structure. This component determines which discourse entities will be most
salient and thereby imposes constraints on available referents for pronouns and re-
duced definite NPs. This is an important issue, but one that RST simply does not
make claims about. As noted earlier, the recognition of intentional structure is crucial
for anaphora resolution, among other discourse-processing tasks. By synthesizing RST
and G&amp;S, work done using both approaches can be applied to accomplishing these
tasks during interpretation and generation.
Finally, while G&amp;S recognize that informational structure is a cue to recognition of
intentional structure, the theory does not provide detail. As discussed in Sections 5.1
and 5.2, the analysis of informational relations provided by RST is inadequate and
incomplete. In either theory, more research is needed to understand how informational
relations are used to achieve discourse intentions.

6.3 Contentious Ground
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986615384615">
The claims of G&amp;S and RST discussed so far have been, we argued, either equiva-
lent or compatible. We now turn to a point of contention between the two theories.
There are distinctions among the RST intentional relations that, in G&amp;S, would be
subtypes of the dominance relation among intentions. However, G&amp;S specifies that
the only relations among intentions affecting discourse structure are dominance and
satisfaction-precedence. Should the various RST intentional relations be incorporated
into a synthesized theory?
The question may be approached from either an empirical or a practical perspec-
tive, and the two perspectives may lead to different answers. To answer the question
empirically, one could code a corpus for its intentional relations and attempt to identify
linguistic cues that correlate with distinctions among the relations. To answer the ques-
tion practically, one would consider whether distinct intentional relations are useful
for computational systems that generate and/or interpret natural language. In fact, the

7. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895">
In this paper, we have argued that two of the most important theories of discourse
structure in computational linguistics, G&amp;S and RST, are not incompatible, but in fact
have considerable common ground. The key to the basic similarity between these two
theories is understanding the correspondence between the notions of dominance in
G&amp;S and nuclearity in RST. Understanding this correspondence between the theories
will enable computational models that effectively synthesize the contributions of the
theories, and thereby are useful both for interpretation and generation of discourse.

In this paper, we argue that the main theories representing these two approaches, RST (Mann and Thompson 1988) and G&amp;S (Grosz and Sidner 1986), make similar claims about how speakers&apos; intentions determine a structure of their discourse. The similarity occurs because the nucleus-satellite relation among text spans in RST corresponds to the dominance relation among intentions in G&amp;S. Building on this similarity, we sketch a partial mapping between the two theories to show that the main points of the two theories are equivalent. Furthermore, the additional claims found in only RST or only G&amp;S are largely consistent. The issue of what structure is determined by semantic (domain) relations in the discourse and how this structure might be related to the intentional structure is discussed.

Because constraints may be needed in order to make progress on these issues, we point out two approaches to constraining the definition of informational structure. In Section 6.2 we suggest that RST informational relations provide a version of one of these approaches. The most inclusive definition of informational structure would contain all the domain relations between the things being talked about. Included would be causal relations of various sorts, set relations, relations underlying bridging inferences (Clark and Haviland 1977), and the relation of identity between domain objects underlying coreference of noun phrases across utterances. By this definition, informational structure is a complex network of domain relations that is defined independently of the intentional structure. Keeping track of all domain relations in a discourse is an overwhelming task and is often infeasible. One approach to constraining informational structure is to define it as parasitic on intentional structure. The informational structure would contain an accompanying informational relation for each intentional relation. A second approach to </context>

The whole discourse is a segment, DS0, that attempts to realize 10, the speaker&apos;s intention for the hearer to adopt the intention of attending the ballet.&apos; As part of her plan to achieve Io, the speaker generates I, the intention for the hearer to adopt the belief that the ballet will be very entertaining. Then, as part of her plan to achieve Ii, the speaker generates 12, the intention that the hearer believe that the show is made up of all new choreography. As shown on the left in Figure 1, 10 dominates II, which in turn dominates 12. Due to these dominance relations, the discourse segment </context>

Both theories agree that a discourse is structured into a hierarchy of non-overlapping constituents, segments in G&amp;S and spans in RST. Each subconstituent may in turn be structured in exactly the same way as the larger constituent. Superficially, the similarity ends there because the internal structure of segments and spans is different. In G&amp;S, the internal structure of a segment consists of any number of embedded segments plus what we are calling the core, the (usually unembedded) 2 As discussed in Mann and Thompson (1988), a motivation relation occurs when a speaker intends the satellite to increase the hearer&apos;s desire to perform the action specified in the nucleus.

Introduction Within the computational discourse community, there is a long-standing debate between proponents of theories based on domain-independent rhetorical relations (most notably Rhetorical Structure Theory, Mann and Thompson 1988, henceforth RST; see also Hobbs 1985) and those who subscribe to theories based on intentionality (most notably that of Grosz and Sidner 1986, henceforth G&amp;S). While some researchers have tried to integrate the two approaches (Moore and Paris 1993; Asher and Lascarides 1994; Hobbs 1993), the two are usually viewed as competing theories. Here we argue that G&amp;S and RST are essentially similar in what they say about how speakers&apos; intentions determine a structure of their discourse. Intentional structure describes the roles that discourse actions play in the speaker&apos;s communicative plan to achieve desired effects on the hearer&apos;s mental state. Intentions encode what the speaker was trying to accomplish with a given portion of discourse.

Intentional structure describes the roles that discourse actions play in the speaker&apos;s communicative plan to achieve desired effects on the hearer&apos;s mental state. Intentions encode what the speaker was trying to accomplish with a given portion of discourse. The relations between intentions indicate whether one intention contributes to the satisfaction of another (dominance) or whether one intention must be satisfied before another (satisfaction-precedence) (Grosz and Sidner 1986). In contrast, informational structure is concerned with domain relations among the things being talked about. Moore and Pollack (1992) argue that both intentional and informational analyses are needed simultaneously. * Learning Research and Development Center, and Department of Linguistics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260.

<context position="5065" citStr="Moore and Pollack 1992" startWordPosition="736" endWordPosition="739">correspondence between the dominance relation between intentions in G&amp;S and the nucleus:satellite relation between text spans in RST. Roughly speaking, an RST nucleus expresses a G&amp;S intention I„, a satellite expresses another intention Is and, in G&amp;S terms, I, dominates I. The correspondence between G&amp;S dominance and RST nuclearity helps to clarify the relationship between ILS and informational structure, the structure determined by underlying semantic (domain) relations. In particular, the undesirable possibility that informational structure could be incompatible with intentional structure (Moore and Pollack 1992) is explained. Further, we argue that a synthesis of G&amp;S and RST is possible because the correspondence between dominance and nuclearity forms a great deal of common ground, and because the remaining claims in the two theories are consistent. 2. Intentional Linguistic Structure in G&amp;S G&amp;S is formulated in terms of the interdependence of three distinct structures. Of the three structures, it is the effect of intentional structure on linguistic structure that concerns us in this paper. This effect is an explicit claim about ILS. In G&amp;S, the intentional structure consists of the set of the speake</context>

An RST analyst must judge which schema consists of RST relation definitions whose constraints and effects best describe the nucleus and satellite spans in the schema application. Mann and Thompson claimed that, for each two consecutive spans in a coherent discourse, a single RST relation will be primary. For reasons discussed in Section 5.1, we consider only the RST presentational relations, or what Moore and Pollack (1992) call intentional relations, in identifying the ILS claims of RST. To illustrate how a speaker&apos;s intentions determine discourse structure in this theory, consider the RST analysis of the example discourse from Figure 1. As shown in Figure 2, at the top level, the text is broken down into two spans: (a) and (b-c). The span (b-c) forms a satellite that stands in a motivation relation to (a). This span can 412 Moser and Moore Discourse Structure a—c motivation a b—c evidence - — Figure 2 The RST structure assigned to the example discourse in Figure 1. be further broken down into the two minimal u</context>

Informational Structure Moore and Pollack (1992) argued that RST defines two types of relations: intentional relations, which arise from the ways in which consecutive discourse elements participate in the speaker&apos;s plan to affect the hearer&apos;s mental state, and informational relations, which obtain between the content conveyed in consecutive elements of a coherent discourse. This is consistent with Mann and Thompson&apos;s (1988, 256) distinction between &amp;quot;presentational&amp;quot; (intentional) and &amp;quot;subject matter&amp;quot; (informational) relations.

The definition of ILS comprises one of the major claims in G&amp;S. ILS is not directly addressed in RST, but is implicit in the RST concept of nuclearity.
