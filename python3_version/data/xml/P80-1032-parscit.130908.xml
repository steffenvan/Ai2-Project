In any technological field, both short-term and long-
term research can be aided by considering where that
technology might be ten, twenty, fifty years down the
pike. In the field of natural language interactive
systems, a 21 year vision is particularly apt to con-
sider, since it brings us to the year 2001. One well-
known vision [1] of 2001 includes the famous computer
named Hal - one offspring, so to speak, of the major
theoretical and engineering breakthrough in computers
that Clarke records as having occurred in the early
1980&apos;s. This computer Hal is able to understand and
converse in perfect idiomatic English (written and
spoken) with the crew of the spacecraft Discovery. And
not just cask-oriented dialogues, mind you!
Hal is a far cry from today&apos;s prototype natural language
query systems, intelligent CAI-systems, diagnostic as-
sistance systems, and Kurzweil machines. For one thing,
Hal is not just responsive: he takes the initiative.
His first documented utterance on board the spacecraft
Discovery comes at a time when the crewmen Bowman and
Poole are engrossed in a fading vision screen image of
Poole&apos;s family on Earth, on the occasion of Poole&apos;s
birthday.
&amp;quot;Sorry to interrupt the festivities,&amp;quot; said Hal,
&amp;quot;but we have a problem.&amp;quot;
Not only can Hal converse in perfect idiomatic English,
but he is a master of problem context (Panel 1) and
social context (Panel 2) as well!
Now Hal is clearly where we currently are not at, and
2001 is clearly only one man&apos;s vision (albeit a very
special man). Yet Clarke&apos;s depiction of Hal raises sev-
eral issues, which along with other ones, provide a cue
for the current panel discussion. The issues include:

1. Where is it that we want to have, must have, can ex-
pect to have, or conversely, should not have to have,
Natural Language Interactive Systems?
2. Barring Clarke&apos;s reliance on the triumph of automat-
ic neural network generation, what are the major hurdles
that still need to be overcome before Natural Language
Interactive Systems become practical?
3. What effects can we expect, deriving from the avail-
ability of, what to me seem, almost magical developments
in hardware?
4. Are there practical (and acceptable) alternatives CO

interacting with machines in natural language in the
various situations that provide a positive answer to
question 1?
5. Should we be shooting for spoken Natural Language
interactions - either input or output or both - or
should we not, like Clarke, go the whole way and expect
our machines to read lips as well.
