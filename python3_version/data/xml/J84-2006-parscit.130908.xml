Aims of the Symposium
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998082647058824">
Practical and methodological problems related to compu-
ter-assisted analysis and retrieval of information, espe-
cially in the area of textual data bases, are far from being
completely solved. In a world where the control of grow-
ing amounts of information has great importance for
every social group, there is a fundamental necessity to
enhance research and realization effopts in this domain.
This is the reason why the Centre de Hautes Etudes
Internationale d&apos;Informatique Documentaire has for
several years undertaken numerous actions for an
improved knowledge of the needs in the area, to facilitate
and promote meetings among research groups throughout
the world, and also in the industrial sector.
With the effective participation and support of high-
level scientific personalities, this Conference will allow an
understanding of the advancement of research in the
field, and an analysis of usefulness of the new systems.

Theoretical Approaches to Natural Language Under-
standing is intended to bring together active researchers
in Computational Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence,
Linguistics, Philosophy, and Cognitive Science to
discuss/hear invited talks, papers, and positions relating
to some of the &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; issues regarding the current state of
natural language understanding. The three topics chosen
for discussion are intended to form the focus for contrib-
utions to Theoretical Approaches to Natural Language
Understanding. The three topics include aspects of
grammars, aspects of semantics/pragmatics, and know-
ledge representation. Each of the three topics will
consider current methodologies: for grammars — theore-
tical developments, especially generalised phrase struc-
ture grammars and logic-based meta-grammars; for
semantics — situational semantics and Montague seman-
tics; for knowledge representation — logical systems
(temporal logics, etc.) and special purpose inference
systems.
Papers are solicited on topics in any of the areas
mentioned above. You are invited to submit four copies
of a paper (double-spaced, maximum 4000 words) to the
program chairman before 12 January 1985. Authors will
be notified of acceptances by 27 February 1985.
Accepted papers, typed on special forms, will be due 30
March 1985 and should be sent to the program chairman.
To make refereeing possible, it is important that the
abstract summarise the novel ideas, contain enough
information about the scope of the work, and include
comparisons to the relevant literature.
Accepted papers will appear in the Proceedings; those
papers so recommended by the reviewers will be consid-
ered for inclusion in a special issue of Computational
Intelligence, an international artificial intelligence journal
published by the National Research Council of Canada.
Presentation of papers at the Workshop will be at the
discretion of the program/organising committee in order
to maintain the focus and workshop flavour of this meet-
ing.
Information concerning local arrangements will be
available from the general chairman. Proceedings will be
distributed at the Workshop and subsequently available
for purchase.

Aim of the Conference
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999213">
The field of pragmatics (as originally defined by Charles
Morris) has in recent years witnessed ever-increasing
diversification. Various disciplines that make use of
pragmatic concepts and that can directly contribute to
our understanding of human communication exist side by
side, with different alleged aims and purposes, methodol-
ogies, and terminologies. It is the aim of this conference
to contribute to the theoretical coherence needed to
improve the capability and applicability of research
results.

The three topics include aspects of grammars, aspects of semantics/pragmatics, and knowledge representation. Each of the three topics will consider current methodologies: for grammars — theoretical developments, especially generalised phrase structure grammars and logic-based meta-grammars; for — situational semantics and Montague semantics; for knowledge representation — logical systems (temporal logics, etc.) and special purpose inference systems. Papers are solicited on topics in any of the areas mentioned above. You are invited to submit four copies of a paper (double-spaced, maximum 4000 words) to the chairman before January 1985. will notified of acceptances by February 1985. papers, typed on special forms, will be due 1985 should be sent to the program chairman. To make refereeing possible, it is important that the abstract summarise the novel ideas, contain enough information about the scope of the work, and include comparisons to the relevant literature. Accepted papers will appear in the Proceedings; those papers so recommended by the reviewers will be considfor inclusion in a special issue of international artificial intelligence journal published by the National Research Council of Canada. Presentation of papers at the Workshop will be at the discretion of the program/organising committee in order to maintain the focus and workshop flavour of this meeting. Information concerning local arrangements will be available from the general chairman. Proceedings will be distributed at the Workshop and subsequently available for purchase.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.772053">The IJCAI conferences are the main forum for the presentation of Artificial Intelligence research to an international audience. The goal of IJCAI-85 is to promote scientific interchange, within and between all subfields of AI, among researchers from all over the world. The conference is sponsored by the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), Inc., and co-sponsored by the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). IJCAI-85 will be held at the University of California, Los Angeles, from August 18 through August 24, 1985, with tutorials on the first two days and technical sessions on the last four days. Topics of Interest Authors are invited to submit papers on substantial, original, and previously unreported research in any aspect of Al, including • AI architectures and languages • Al and education (including intelligent CAI) • Automated reasoning (including theorem proving, automatic programming, planning, search, problem solving, commonsense, and qualitative reasoning) • Cognitive modelling • Expert systems • Knowledge representation • Learning and knowledge acquisition • Logic programming • Natural language (including speech) • Perception (including visual, auditory, tactile) • Philosophical foundations • Robotics • Social, economic, and legal implications Requirements for Submission Authors should submit four (4) complete copies of their paper. (Hard copy only, no electronic submissions.) • Long Papers: 5500 words maximum, up to 7 proceedings pages • Short Papers: 2200 words maximum, up to 3 proceedings pages Each paper will be stringently reviewed by experts in the topic area specified. Acceptance will be based on originality and significance of the reported research, as well as the quality of its presentation. Applications clearly demonstrating the power of established techniques, as well as thoughtful critiques of previously published material will be considered, provided that they point the way to new research and are substantive scientific contributions in their own right. Short papers are a forum for the presentation of succinct, crisp results. They&apos;re not a safety net for long paper rejections. In order to ensure appropriate refereeing, authors are requested to specify in which of the above topic areas the paper belongs, as well as a set of no more than five keywords for further classification within that topic area. Because of time constraints, papers requiring major revisions cannot be accepted. Details for Submission The following information must be included with each paper: • Author&apos;s name, address, telephone number and netmail address (if applicable) • Topic area (plus a set of no more than five keywords for further classification within the topic area) • An abstract of 100-200 words • Paper length (in words) Time Table</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.977868933333333">Morris) has in recent years witnessed ever-increasing diversification. Various disciplines that make use of pragmatic concepts and that can directly contribute to our understanding of human communication exist side by side, with different alleged aims and purposes, methodologies, and terminologies. It is the aim of this conference to contribute to the theoretical coherence needed to improve the capability and applicability of research results. Structure During each of the five morning sessions two lectures will be delivered by representatives of different disciplines dealing with pragmatic aspects of language.
