In the five years since it was proposed, the
MATE scheme for anaphoric annotation has
been used in a variety of annotation projects,
and the resulting corpora have been used to
study both anaphora resolution and NL gener-
ation. Annotation tools inspired by the propos-
als have been used in some of these projects.
In this paper we discuss these first experiences
with the scheme, some lessons that have been
learned, and suggest a few modifications.

The MATE ‘meta-scheme’ for anaphora annotation (Poe-
sio et al., 1999) is one of the annotation schemes devel-
oped as part of the MATE project (McKelvie et al., 2001),
whose goal was to develop annotation tools suitable for
different types of dialogue annotation. The scheme has
served as the basis for a number of annotation projects,
such as the development of the GNOME corpus (Poe-
sio, 2000a) and, more recently, of the VENEX corpus of
anaphora in Italian spoken dialogue and text (Poesio et
al., 2004a). The GNOME corpus has been used to study
salience, particularly as formalized in Centering theory
(Poesio et al., 2004c), to develop statistical models of nat-
ural language generation (e.g., (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel
et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001; Cheng, 2001; Karama-
nis, 2003)) and to evaluate anaphora resolution systems,
with a special focus on the resolution of bridging refer-
ences (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov,
2004; Poesio et al., 2004b). Aspects of the scheme have
been implemented in annotation tools including MMAX
(M¨uller and Strube, 2003) and the Annotator tool devel-
oped by ILSP. As a result of this work, many aspects
of the proposals concerning anaphoric annotation made
in MATE and GNOME have been subjected to a thorough
test. In this paper we discuss some of the lessons learned
through this work, some issues that have been raised, and
how they have been or could be addressed.

2 The MATE Proposals
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990472">
The design of an annotation scheme involves a number
of decisions: what has to be annotated, how, and how
the annotation should be recorded (the markup scheme).
One of the most important motivations behind the design
of the MATE proposals for anaphoric annotation is the be-
lief that given the variety of phenomena that go under the
name of anaphora, and the variety of possible applica-
tions, there can be no such thing as a general-purpose
anaphoric annotation instructions. On the other hand,
we also believed that it is possible to design a general
purpose markup scheme (and therefore, general-purpose
tools) that could then be used in different ways for dif-
ferent projects. The approach taken in MATE was then
to design a general markup scheme (the ‘meta-scheme’)
and then to show its basic building blocks could be used
to implement different types of anaphoric annotation, in-
cluding some of the most popular schemes for ’coref-
erence annotation,’ such as the MUC scheme (MUCCS)
(Hirschman, 1998), Passonneau’s DRAMA scheme (1997)
, and the scheme used for annotation of references to
landmarks in the MapTask corpus. In this section we
summarize the most distinctive features of the proposals
resulting from this basic assumption. The full description
of the MATE scheme is available from the MATE project
pages at http://mate.nis.sdu.dk/.

2.1 Coreference, Anaphora and Discourse
Modeling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998984375">
The MATE scheme differs from the best-known scheme
for annotating ‘coreference,’ MUCCS (Hirschman, 1998)
both in the conceptualization underlying the annotation
(i.e., what type of information should be annotated) and
in the way this information is marked up. MUCCS was
designed to encode information deemed useful for a sub-
task of information extraction, and the instructions pro-
vided to annotators were meant to ensure that all infor-
mation provided by a text about a certain entity would be
marked using a single device, the IDENT relation. As
van Deemter and Kibble (2000) point out, however, the
result is rather ad hoc; the IDENT relation as defined by
the instructions doesn’t capture any coherent definition
of ‘coreference’. (In fact, the very notion of ‘reference’
is rather difficult to formalize precisely.)
The MATE proposals, by contrast, while still labeled as
proposals for ‘coreference annotation,’ because the name
has become a de facto standard as a result of the MUC
initiative, are explicitly based on the DISCOURSE MODEL
assumption adopted almost universally by linguists (com-
putational and not) working on anaphora resolution and
generation (Webber, 1979; Heim, 1982; Kamp and Reyle,
1993; Gundel et al., 1993). This is the hypothesis that
interpreting a discourse involves building a shared dis-
course model containing DISCOURSE ENTITIES that may
or may not ‘refer’ to specific objects in the world, as well
as the relations between these entities. The type of an-
notation for which the MATE scheme was developed–and
that we’ll call here ’anaphoric annotation,’.1 is meant as
a partial representation of the discourse model evoked by
a text (hence, for example, the tag used for nominal ex-
pressions denoting discourse entities, (de)).2

2.2 The Markup Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999801866666667">
The design of the MATE workbench was strongly inspired
by the concept of STANDOFF ANNOTATION developed for
the reorganization of the MapTask. The main principle
of standoff annotation is that each level of annotation–
for example, syntactic annotation, dialogue act annota-
tion, and anaphoric annotation–should be stored indepen-
dently; in this way, annotators working on one level need
not be concerned about the other levels of annotation, and
can start immediately without having to wait for other an-
notation tasks to be completed. The separate levels of
annotation are synchronized via a base file, to which the
separate levels point using the HREF mechanism of XML.
The markup scheme for anaphoric relations is the
core aspect of the MATE proposals and its most dis-
tinctive aspect. As in the MUC scheme, it is as-

1van Deemter and Kibble (2000) give a stricly textual def-
inition of ‘anaphora’ which is very distant from the common
use of the term ‘anaphora resolution’ in computational linguis-
tics, typically used to indicate the interpretation of (parts of) the
meaning of an expression with respect to the discourse model.
2In fact, the use of the term ‘coreference annotation’ would
not be completely misguided. van Deemter and Kibble (2000)
assume the definition of ‘reference’ typically found in formal
semantics, but in functional linguistics, the term ‘referring ex-
pression’ is used to indicate expressions that introduce new dis-
course entities in a discourse model or that denote an old one
(see, e.g., (Gundel et al., 1993)).
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992775">
sumed that annotation of anaphoric information involves
identifying MARKABLES (the text constituent that real-
ize semantic objects that may enter in anaphoric rela-
tions), and marking up anaphoric relations between them.
The main difference from MUCCS is that whereas in
MUCCS anaphoric relations are annotated using an at-
tribute of the markables, in the MATE markup scheme–
following the recommendations of the Text Encoding Ini-
tiative (Burnard and Sperberg-McQueen, 2002), and of
Bruneseaux and Romary (1998)–the distinction between
these two steps of annotation is mirrored by a distinc-
tion between two XML elements: (de), used to indi-
cate the markables, and (link), used to mark informa-
tion about anaphoric relations (or any other semantic re-
lation).3 However, unlike in the TEI proposals, in the
MATE markup scheme (link) elements are structured
elements, containing one or more (anchor) element.
The (link) element specifies the anaphoric expression
(using XML’s HREF mechanism) and the relation between
the anaphoric expression and its antecedent; whereas the
(anchor) element specifies the antecedent, as in (1)
where, for example, the first (link) elements encodes
the information that the discourse entities realized by the
NPs the engine E3 and it denote the same object.

There were two main reasons for having (link) ele-
ments separated from the elements used to indicate mark-
ables. The first reason is that in this way (link) ele-
ments can be kept in a separate file from (de) elements,
in keeping with the idea of standoff annotation. The sec-
ond, and more important, reason is that in this way it is
possible to annotate multiple anaphoric relations involv-
ing the same anaphoric expression without having multi-
ple attributes for each markable.
The reason why (link) elements may have more than
one (anchor) element is to allow for the possibility to
annotate ambiguities. For some types of applications, it
may be a good idea not to ask annotators to decide upon
the interpretation of ambiguous anaphoric expressions.
3It was assumed that the tags for ‘coreference’ annotation
would be part of a special namespace, COREF–i.e., that the ac-
tual name of these tags are (coref:de), (coref:link), etc.
We omit the namespace indication in this paper.
In these cases, the multiple anchors mechanisms allows
each of the possibilities to be marked by means of a sepa-
rate (anchor) element. In (2a), for example, the pronun
it in 15.16 could refer equally well to engine E3 or the
tanker car. With the MATE mechanism, both antecedents
can be annotated, as shown in (2b).

2.3 Instantiations of the Meta-Scheme

<bodyText confidence="0.999733517241379">
As said above, the markup elements just discussed were
meant to be general enough to support different types of
annotation. Three such examples were considered.
The Core Scheme In the most basic type of corefer-
ence scheme, only anaphoric relations between NPs are
considered, and only identity relations. Schemes of this
type can be implemented by having just one anaphoric
relation, IDENT. The remaining differences between the
schemes have then mostly to do with the instructions to
annotators–for example, which types of anaphoric rela-
tions to be considered as cases of ’identity’ (see (van
Deemter and Kibble, 2000) for some problems with the
choices made in MUCCS). In the comments for the de-
signers of a scheme, it was suggested that some of the
cases marked as coreference in MUCCS, such as the rela-
tion between the temperature and 90 degrees in the tem-
perature rose to 90 degrees before dropping to 70 de-
grees, would be best marked as function-value relations
(viewing the temperature as a function from objects and
time points into values, rather than an individual-denoting
term).
Extended Relations In DRAMA, a number of associa-
tive relations are considered, such as SUBSET or PART,
together with instructions how to annotate them. This
types of anaphora can be annotated in the MATE markup
scheme using additional relations, as in (3), where the
discourse entity realized by LES FUSEES QUI ONT
BIEN VOLE‘ denotes a subset of the set denoted by dis-
course entity DE 88, LES MODELES DE FUSEES.

It was pointed out, however, that the results of
Poesio and Vieira (1998) indicated that this type of an-
notation could be highly unreliable.
References to the Visual Situation A special
(universe) element was suggested for MapTask-
style annotations of references to visible objects. The
(universe) element containing one (ue) element
for each object in the visual scene; including such
elements in an annotation makes it possible to use
(link) elements to annotate references to such objects.4
Cases in which the participants to a conversation have
different visual situations, as in the MapTask dialogues,
can be handled by having separate universes, one for
each participant to the conversation. In addition, a
WHO-BELIEVES attribute of (link) elements was
proposed to represent situations in which only one
participant believes that a particular anaphoric relation
holds, as in example (7) (Appendix A), where it’s only
the follower to believe that a gold mine refers to the same
object as diamond mine.

2.4 Instructions for Identifying Markables
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993290297297297">
Because the goal of the MATE annotation proposals was
to provide a set of tools that could be used to imple-
ment a variety of options, rather than to identify a spe-
cific scheme appropriate for all applications, it didn’t
make sense to specify detailed instructions for annota-
tion. However, a substantial effort was made to pro-
vide an exhaustive inventory of the options for identi-

fying markables that were available to the designers of
a scheme for anaphoric annotation. These suggestions
were in part derived from MUCCS and from Passonneau’s
DRAMA scheme, but a number of additional problems
were considered as well.
As in MUCCS, it was assumed that annotation of
anaphora is best separated in two steps: first the mark-
ables (the text constituent that realize semantic objects
that may enter in anaphoric relations) are agreed upon,
then anaphoric relations between them are marked.
Concerning markable identification, the main sugges-
tions were to concentrate on anaphoric expressions re-
alized as NPs and their antecedents; and to rely on the
output of a parser as much as possible. But because of
the assumption that only NPs evoking discourse entities
should be considered, it was suggested that not all NP
should be treated as markables: for example, it was rec-
ommended that NPs in post-verbal position in predica-
tive clauses (such as a policeman in John is a policeman)
should be excluded. This recommendation was later re-
considered (see below).
One of the novel aspects of the MATE instructions was
the concern for markable identification in languages other
than English. One such issue was how to deal with incor-
porated clitics and empty subjects; the suggestion was to
use a separate element, (seg), to turn verbs into non-
nominal markables, as in the following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.909427">

type=&amp;quot;ident&amp;quot;&gt;
&lt;anchor href=&amp;quot;coref.xml#id(de_157)&amp;quot;/&gt;
&lt;/link&gt;
It was also proposed that the (seg) element could be
used in more ambitious schemes as general mechanism
for specifying non-nominal markables –e.g., in ellipsis,
to indicate the antecedents of discourse deixis, etc.5

Ideas from the MATE ’scheme’ have been adopted and

3.1 Annotation work related to the GNOME project
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984763362637363">
The most direct application of the ideas discussed above
was found in the annotation work undertaken as part of
the GNOME project. GNOME was concerned with the em-
pirical investigation of the aspects of discourse that ap-
pear to affect generation, especially salience (Pearson et
al., 2000; Poesio et al., 2000; Poesio and Di Eugenio,
2001; Poesio and Nissim, 2001; Poesio et al., 2004c).
Particular attention was paid to the factors affecting the
generation of pronouns (Pearson et al., 2000; Henschel et
al., 2000), demonstratives (Poesio and Nygren-Modjeska,
To appear) possessives (Poesio and Nissim, 2001) and
definites in general (Poesio, 2004). These results, and
the annotated corpus, were applied to the development
of both symbolic and statistical natural language genera-
tion algorithms with the application of these empirical re-
sults to natural language generation, from sentence plan-
ning (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al., 2000; Cheng et al.,
2001), to aggregation (Cheng, 2001) and text planning
(Kibble and Power, 2000; Karamanis, 2003). The empir-
ical side of the project involved both psychological exper-
iments and corpus annotation, based on a scheme based
on the MATE proposals, as well as on a detailed anno-
tation manual (Poesio, 2000b), the reliability of whose
instructions was tested by extensive experiments (Poesio,
2000a). More recently, the corpus has also been used to
develop and evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with
a special focus on the resolution of bridging references
(Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004;
Poesio et al., 2004b).
The corpus The GNOME corpus currently includes
texts from three domains, about 3000 NPs were anno-
tated in each domain. The museum subcorpus consists
of descriptions of museum objects, generally with an as-
sociated picture, and brief texts about the artists that pro-
duced them. The pharmaceutical subcorpus is a selection
of leaflets providing the patients with legally mandatory
information about their medicine.
Several layers of information were annotated, includ-
ing layout in the case of text and rhetorical structure in
the case of tutorial dialogues, sentences and potential ut-
terances, noun phrases, a variety of attributes of the ob-
jects denoted by noun phrases,6 and anaphoric relation.
We concentrate here on anaphoric information, and refer
the reader to the manual for the other types of annotation.
Markup scheme The markup scheme for markables
and anaphoric relations adopted in GNOME follows very
6E.g., whether an NP denoted generically or not; whether it
denoted an animate or inanimate entity, as well as other onto-
logical properties; and whether it denoted a discourse entity, a
quantifier, or a predicate. In the case of a discourse entity, we
also annotated whether it denoted an atom, a set, or a mass term;
and whether it denoted uniquely or not.
closely that proposed in MATE, except that the (de) ele-
ment was renamed (ne) (since all NPs were marked), and
the (link) element was renamed (ante). More sub-
stantial differences are the decision not to use standoff,
and the introduction of new elements necessary for the
study of salience, such as elements that could be used to
investigate the notion of UTTERANCE used in Centering
(Poesio et al., 2004c).
Although standoff is a clear improvement over includ-
ing all annotation levels in a single file, our own expe-
riences during the creation of the GNOME corpus being
further proof of this, it’s only really possible when tools
are available both to create the annotation and–crucially–
later to ’knit back’ the separate levels when needed. As
neither the MATE workbench nor any other tools based
on standoff were available by the time the GNOME an-
notation started,7 in GNOME we didn’t use standoff, but
integrated all levels of annotation in one file; an Emacs
mode was developed for the annotation. This decision
made it very easy to use the annotated corpus for a num-
ber of studies, but did resulted in a number of problems,
the main among which were that the annotators had to be
very careful not to damage other annotations; that annota-
tors working on one level were occasionally confused by
annotations for other levels; and that the annotation work
had to be organized in a careful sequential way even for
levels that could have been annotated independently.
The main new aspect of the markup scheme, espe-
cially as far as our studies of salience were concerned,
are the elements used to annotate potential utterances
in the sense of Centering (Grosz et al., 1995). In or-
der not to prejudge the answer to the question of which
text constituents are best viewed as utterances, we used a
‘generic’ element called (unit) to mark up finite and
non-finite clauses, but also parentheticals and apposi-
tions, elements of bulleted lists, etc.
The following example illustrates both the use of
(unit) elements and of the elements (ne) and (ante)
replacing (de) and (link):

Bridging References Apart from the basic anaphoric
relations of identity, in GNOME we were concerned with
bridging references, hence our annotation scheme in-
corporated aspects of the ‘Extended Relations’ and the
‘MapTask’ instantiations of the MATE meta-scheme.
One of our aims was to continue the work on bridging
references annotation and interpretation in (Poesio and
Vieira, 1998), which showed that marking up bridging
references is quite hard. In addition, work such as (Sid-
ner, 1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999) suggested that indi-
rect realization can play a crucial role in maintaining the
CB. After testing a few types of associative reference
(Hawkins, 1978), we decided to annotate only three non-
identity relations, as well as identity. These relations are
a subset of those proposed in the ‘extended relations’ ver-
sion of the MATE scheme: set membership (ELEMENT),
subset (SUBSET), and ‘generalized possession’ (POSS),
which includes both part-of relations and ownership rela-
tions.
Coder manual Perhaps the most important aspects of
the annotation work in GNOME are the development of
detailed instructions for annotators and the reliability ex-
periments testing several aspects of the scheme, particu-
larly the annotation of bridging references.
The identification of sentences, units and markables
was done entirely by hand, without encountering particu-
lar problems. (The Emacs mode, an extension of SGML-
mode, provides some support for introducing new ele-
ments, marking regions, and attribute editing, as well as
anaphoric annotation.) Unlike in MATE, all NPs were
tagged as (ne). The instructions for (unit)s were
based on Marcu’s proposals for discourse units annota-
tion (Marcu, 1999). All attributes of sentences, (unit)s
and (ne)s in the final version of the scheme, including
DEIX, can be annotated reliably.
In order to achieve reliability on anaphoric anno-
tation, the range of anaphoric phenomena considered
was restricted in many ways. Apart from marking a
limited number of associative relations, the annotators
only marked relations between objects realized by noun
phrases and not, for example, anaphoric references to
actions, events or propositions implicitly introduced by
clauses or sentences. We also gave strict instructions
to our annotators concerning how much to mark. They
were told to mark all identity relations, but to mark as-
sociative relations only if either (i) no IDENT relation
could be marked for the anaphoric expression, or (ii)
an IDENT relation with an entity not mentioned in the
previous (unit). Furthermore, preferences were speci-
fied, e.g., for appositions: for example, in Francois, the
Dauphin, the embedding NP would be chosen as an an-
tecedent of subsequent anaphoric references, rather than
the NP in appositive position.
We found a reasonable, although by no means perfect,
agreement on identity relations. In a typical analysis (two
annotators looking at the anaphoric relations between 200
NPs) we observed no real disagreements; 79.4% of these
relations were marked up by both annotators; 12.8% by
only one of them; and in 7.7% of the cases, one of the
annotators marked up a closer antecedent than the other.
Limiting the relations did limit the disagreements among
annotators on associative relations (only 4.8% of the re-
lations are actually marked differently) but only 22% of
bridging references were marked in the same way by both
annotators; 73.17% of relations are marked by only one
or the other annotator. Reaching agreement on this infor-
mation involved several discussions between annotators
and more than one pass over the corpus (Poesio, 2000a).

3.2 Annotation tools
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987">
Although no annotation tool implementing the MATE or
GNOME schemes as described exists, in the years after
the development of the MATE guidelines tools supporting
XML standoff annotation for coreference have appeared,
including MMAX from EML (M¨uller and Strube, 2003)
and the Annotator from ILSP. Although the format used
for storing anaphoric information by these tools is not
entirely satisfactory, the files they produce can be easily
converted into MATE format.
MMAX, for example, is based on a simplified stand-
off format, in which three main files are maintained for
each annotated file in the corpus: a base file contain-
ing the words, a file identifying sentences, and a file
identifying markables. Anaphoric information is stored
as attributes of the markables. Two special attributes
are used for this purpose, and recognized by MMAX:
the MEMBER attribute, used to indicate membership in a
coreference chain (a coreference equivalence class), and
the POINTER attribute, used to mark up to one associa-
tive anaphoric relation for each anaphoric expression. We
discuss the use of MMAX in the VENEX project below.

3.3 The VENEX Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99937679245283">
The VENEX corpus is an anaphorically annotated corpus
of Italian being created in a joint project between the
Universit´a di Venezia and the University of Essex. The
corpus includes both texts (newspaper articles) and dia-
logues (an Italian version of the MapTask corpus). This
project widened our experiences of annotation with the
MATE scheme in a number of respects. First of all, a
number of proposals contained in the MATE guidelines
but not relevant for GNOME, including the suggestions
for dealing with misunderstandings and for incorporated
anaphoric expressions such as clitics, were tested. Sec-
ondly, in this project we are attempting to identify mark-
ables automatically as far a possible, and data are stored
in a standoff format, using a modern annotation tool
(MMAX) for the annotation.
Markup Scheme As MMAX doesn’t support (link)
elements, and anaphoric information is stored with mark-
ables, it is necessary to use markable attributes to repre-
sent information that would have been encoded as part of
the links. We used a separate attribute to specify the type
of associative relation used by POINTER attribute, and a
SPACE attribute to encode the information stored in the
WHO-BELIEVES attribute of links (see below). In addi-
tion, only one MEMBER and POINTER attributes can be
specified for each markable.
This latter limitation wasn’t much of a problem, given
that the annotation instructions used in VENEX are de-
rived from those developed for GNOME and also attempt
to limit annotators to mark at most one identity and one
bridging relation for each anaphoric expression. The sep-
aration of attributes of links proved, however, a problem,
as annotators often forget to annotate one or the other.
An additional problem is that the version of MMAX we
used (0.92) only allows for one type of markable, mean-
ing that (unit) elements could not be annotated, and
instead of using separate (ne) and (seg) elements for
nominal and non-nominal markables, a single markable
had to be used (see below).8
Misunderstandings The MapTask part of the VENEX
corpus contains numerous examples like (7), where the
differences between Giver and Follower map lead to one
participant believing that two objects are anaphorically
related, while the other participant either is not aware of
this or doesn’t believe this to be the case. We found that
after a few iterations of training, our annotators were able
to handle these cases properly (a more formal evaluation
is underway; we hope to report the results at the meet-
ing). Again, the only problems were caused by the fact
that these attributes had to be added to markables, which
sometimes led to annotators forgetting to set them. (This
was only required in case the default, that an anaphoric
relation was in the common ground of both participants,
didn’t hold.)

Our experience with multi-level annotation in GNOME
suggests that standoff is clearly the way to go, allowing
multiple annotators to work on the same files, and sepa-
rating logically independent tasks, but appropriate tools
are required. The annotation tools we have discussed,
such as MMAX, are therefore useful even though they do

not implement all aspects of the MATE. Knitting back is
also possible with the Discourse API.
Our experience with VENEX suggests that two of the
most beneficial aspects of having a separate (link) ele-
ment are ones that we had not originally considered: that
they can be used to mark general semantic relations, not
just anaphoric relations (for more complex types of se-
mantic annotation); and that they make it harder for an-
notators to forget to fill in aspects of the annotation. Un-
fortunately, at the moment there is no tool that can be
used to create this type of annotation directly.

4.2 Aspects already reconsidered
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99953275">
Predicative NPs During the GNOME and VENEX anno-
tations we realized that the recommendation not to mark
predicative NPs makes it impossible to do markable iden-
tification automatically. In addition, it’s often difficult
to decide whether an NP is used predicatively or refer-
entially, especially in languages like Italian where sub-
jects in such clauses are often used predicatively (as in
La soluzione e’ questa). In GNOME, a new attribute
LF TYPE was introduced to specify the type of seman-
tic object denoted by an NP: term, quant and pred.
The annotators were instructed to concentrate on term-
denoting NPs. The instructions for classifying NPs ac-
cording to their semantic type were based mostly on syn-
tactic information, but the annotation was reliable. In the
instructions for the VENEX annotation, the instructions
for recognizing term-denoting NP are further developed.
Restricting the range of associative relations The
range of associative relations tested in GNOME is much
narrower than those considered in DRAMA, but they can
be annotated reliably, at least in the sense that very few
disagreements are observed. Extending the range of re-
lations to include, for example, attributes (e.g, I am not
going to buy that. The price is too high. or situational
associations (John entered a restaurant. The waiter ap-
proached him immediately) has proven difficult.
Units and Utterances The study of Centering car-
ried in GNOME indicated quite clearly that annotation of
(unit) elements is essential for the study of anaphora.

4.3 Further Revisions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993234375">
One aspect of the markup scheme that needs revision is
the placement of the semantic relation. One problem we
observed in GNOME is that often the ambiguity is not
simply between two possible antecedents each of which
stands in the same relation to the anaphoric expression,
but between two antecedents which stand in different re-
lations. In the pharmaceutical texts, for example, it is of-
ten unclear whether a particular mention of the medicine
under consideration refers to the generic product, or to the
particular instance that the user has in their hands. In this
case, we would want annotators to mark the anaphoric ex-
pression as IDENT with one object, and ELEMENT of the
other (ELEMENT is also used in GNOME for relations be-
tween instances and types), as follows, but this is not pos-
sible in either the original MATE scheme or in the GNOME
markup scheme:

4.4 Open Issues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929958333333">
Ambiguity Offering annotators the opportunity to an-
notate anaphoric ambiguity is essential, especially for an-
notations used to study linguistic phenomena, but raises
serious theoretical and practical problems. A coreference
chain containing such links becomes a coreference (di-
rected) graph, in which each of the paths across the graph
is a potential interpretation. While having multiple paths
is not a problem as far as evaluating the results of an
anaphoric resolver (any path in the graph counts as a valid
solution), it is a serious problems both for scripts attempt-
ing to ensure consistency (e.g., that all references to the
same object are marked as either generic or non-generic–
this is of course impossible when one of the possible an-
tecedents is generic while the other isn’t) as well for an-
notation tools (the problem is of course worsened when
the tool only uses a single attribute to indicate member-
ship in a coreference chain).
Revision A second difficult problem is caused by cases,
common in the MapTask dialogues, in which after a while
a participant realizes that their previous belief that an ob-
ject was identical to another object is mistaken. In these
cases, the participant is arguably revising their previous
beliefs; it is not clear then what should be done with the
annotation of the original anaphoric information.

The main new aspect of the markup scheme, especially as far as our studies of salience were concerned, are the elements used to annotate potential utterances in the sense of Centering (Grosz et al., 1995). In order not to prejudge the answer to the question of which text constituents are best viewed as utterances, we used a ‘generic’ element called (unit) to mark up finite and non-finite clauses, but also parentheticals and appositions, elements of bulleted lists, etc. The following example illustrates both the use of (unit) elements and of the elements (ne) and (ante) replacing (de) and (link): (5) &lt;unit finite=’finite-yes’ id=’u227’&gt; &lt;ne id=’ne546’ gf=’subj’&gt; The drawing of &lt;ne id=’ne547’ gf=’np-compl’&gt;the corner cupboard &lt;/ne&gt; &lt;/ne&gt; &lt;unit finite=’no-finite’ id=’u228’&gt;, or more probably &lt;ne </context>

The main difference from MUCCS is that whereas in MUCCS anaphoric relations are annotated using an attribute of the markables, in the MATE markup scheme– following the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative (Burnard and Sperberg-McQueen, 2002), and of Bruneseaux and Romary (1998)–the distinction between these two steps of annotation is mirrored by a distinction betwe</context>

One of our aims was to continue the work on bridging references annotation and interpretation in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), which showed that marking up bridging references is quite hard. In addition, work such as (Sidner, 1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999) suggested that indirect realization can play a crucial role in maintaining the CB. After testing a few types of associative reference (Hawkins, 1978), we decided to annotate only three nonidentity relations, as well as identity. These relations are a subset of those proposed in the ‘extended relations’ version of the MATE scheme: set membership (ELEMENT), subset (SUBSET), and ‘generalized possession’ (POSS), which includes both part-of relations and ownership relations.

On the other hand, we also believed that it is possible to design a general purpose markup scheme (and therefore, general-purpose tools) that could then be used in different ways for different projects. The approach taken in MATE was then to design a general markup scheme (the ‘meta-scheme’) and then to show its basic building blocks could be used to implement different types of anaphoric annotation, including some of the most popular schemes for ’coreference annotation,’ such as the MUC scheme (MUCCS) (Hirschman, 1998), Passonneau’s DRAMA scheme (1997) , and the scheme used for annotation of references to landmarks in the MapTask corpus. In this section we summarize the most distinctive features of the proposals resulting from this basic assumption. The full description of the MATE scheme is available from the MATE project pages at http://mate.nis.sdu.dk/. 2.1 Coreference, Anaphora and Discourse Modeling The MATE scheme differs from the best-known scheme for annotating ‘coreference,’ MUCCS (Hirschman, 1998) both in the conceptualization underlying the annotation (i.e., what type of information should be ann</context>

The identification of sentences, units and markables was done entirely by hand, without encountering particular problems. (The Emacs mode, an extension of SGMLmode, provides some support for introducing new elements, marking regions, and attribute editing, as well as anaphoric annotation.) Unlike in MATE, all NPs were tagged as (ne). The instructions for (unit)s were based on Marcu’s proposals for discourse units annotation (Marcu, 1999). All attributes of sentences, (unit)s and (ne)s in the final version of the scheme, including DEIX, can be annotated reliably. In order to achieve reliability on anaphoric annotation, the range of anaphoric phenomena considered was restricted in many ways. Apart from marking a limited number of associative relations, the annotators only marked relations between objects realized by noun phrases and not, for example, anaphoric references to actions, events or propositions implicitly introduced by clauses or sentences.

In this paper we discuss these first experiences with the scheme, some lessons that have been learned, and suggest a few modifications. 1 Introduction The MATE ‘meta-scheme’ for anaphora annotation (Poesio et al., 1999) is one of the annotation schemes developed as part of the MATE project (McKelvie et al., 2001), whose goal was to develop annotation tools suitable for different types of dialogue annotation. The scheme has served as the basis for a number of annotation projects, such as the development of the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2000a) and, more recently, of the VENEX corpus of anaphora in Italian spoken dialogue and text (Poesio et al., 2004a). The GNOME corpus has been used to study salience, particularly as formalized in Centering theory (Poesio et al., 2004c), to develop statistical models of natural language generation (e.g., (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001; Cheng, 200</context>

The (universe) element containing one (ue) element for each object in the visual scene; including such elements in an annotation makes it possible to use (link) elements to annotate references to such objects.4 Cases in which the participants to a conversation have different visual situations, as in the MapTask dialogues, can be handled by having separate universes, one for each participa</context>

Bridging References Apart from the basic anaphoric relations of identity, in GNOME we were concerned with bridging references, hence our annotation scheme incorporated aspects of the ‘Extended Relations’ and the ‘MapTask’ instantiations of the MATE meta-scheme. One of our aims was to continue the work on bridging references annotation and interpretation in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), which showed that marking up bridging references is quite hard. In addition, work such as (Sidner, 1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999) suggested that indirect realization can play a crucial role in maintaining the CB. After testing a few types of associative reference (Hawkins, 1978), we decided to annotate only three nonidentity relations, as well as identity. These relations are a subset of those proposed in the ‘extended relations’ version of the MATE scheme: set membership (ELEMENT), subset (SUBSET), and ‘generalized possession’ (POSS), which includes both part-of relations and ownership relati</context>

More substantial differences are the decision not to use standoff, and the introduction of new elements necessary for the study of salience, such as elements that could be used to investigate the notion of UTTERANCE used in Centering (Poesio et al., 2004c). Although standoff is a clear improvement over including all annotation levels in a single file, our own experiences during the creation of the GNOME corpus being further proof of this, it’s only really possible when tools are available both to create the annotation and–crucially– later to ’knit back’ the separate levels when needed. As neither the MATE workbench nor any other tools based on standoff were available by the time the GNOME annotation started,7 in GNOME we didn’t use standoff, but integrated all levels of annotation in one file; an Emacs mode was developed for the annotation.

In this paper we discuss these first experiences with the scheme, some lessons that have been learned, and suggest a few modifications. 1 Introduction The MATE ‘meta-scheme’ for anaphora annotation (Poesio et al., 1999) is one of the annotation schemes developed as part of the MATE project (McKelvie et al., 2001), whose goal was to develop annotation tools suitable for different types of dialogue annotation. The scheme has served as the basis for a number of annotation projects, such as the development of the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2000a) and, more recently, of the VENEX corpus of anaphora in Italian spoken dialogue and text (Poesio et al., 2004a). The GNOME corpus has been used to study salience, particularly as formalized in Centering theory (Poesio et al., 2004c), to develop statistical models of natural language generation (e.g., (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001; Cheng, 2001; Karamanis, 2003)) and to evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with a special focus on the resolution of bridging references (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004; Poesio et al., 2004b).

Particular attention was paid to the factors affecting the generation of pronouns (Pearson et al., 2000; Henschel et al., 2000), demonstratives (Poesio and Nygren-Modjeska, To appear) possessives (Poesio and Nissim, 2001) and definites in general (Poesio, 2004). These results, and the annotated corpus, were applied to the development of both symbolic and statistical natural language generation algorithms with the application of these empirical results to natural language generation, from sentence planning (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001), to aggregation (Cheng, 2001) and text planning (Kibble and Power, 2000; Karamanis, 2003). The empirical side of the project involved both psychological experiments and corpus annotation, based on a scheme based on the MATE proposals, as well as on a detailed annotation manual (Poesio, 2000b), the reliability of whose instructions was tested by extensive experiments (Poesio, 2000a).

(In fact, the very notion of ‘reference’ is rather difficult to formalize precisely.) The MATE proposals, by contrast, while still labeled as proposals for ‘coreference annotation,’ because the name has become a de facto standard as a result of the MUC initiative, are explicitly based on the DISCOURSE MODEL assumption adopted almost universally by linguists (computational and not) working on anaphora resolution and generation (Webber, 1979; Heim, 1982; Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Gundel et al., 1993). This is the hypothesis that interpreting a discourse involves building a shared discourse model containing DISCOURSE ENTITIES that may or may not ‘refer’ to specific objects in the world, as well as the relations between these entities. The type of annotation for which the MATE scheme was developed–and that we’ll call here ’anaphoric annotation,’.1 is meant as a partial representation of the discourse model evoked by a text (hence, for example, the tag used for nominal expressions denoting discourse entities, (de)).2 2.2 The Markup Sche</context>
