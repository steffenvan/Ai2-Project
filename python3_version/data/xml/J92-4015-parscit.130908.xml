Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are
paid. Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most
ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. A late payment fee will be charged for
renewals made after 1 April; this fee does not apply to new members. Institutions now subscribe to the journal
through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; +1-617-253-2889. Back issues and
proceedings are available only from the ACL, except that institutions should backorder journals for 1988 and follow-
ing years through MIT Press. Payments for dues, back issues, and proceedings can be made in Europe and Japan as
well as the U.S. Read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify institutional
affiliation, if it is not part of your address. Also provide telephone country &amp; region codes and computer network &amp;
email address, even if you have done so before. Write legibly, please!

MEMBERSHIP DUES FOR 1993: Dues for Regular Members are $30. Couples with the same mailing address
may become Joint Members for $40; they will receive only one set of publications, but each will be eligible for all
other member benefits. Students taking a full-time program of courses and not earning a regular income may be-
come Student Members for $20 with copy of current student ID. Students who are not Student Members and pay at
the Regular rate can still participate in student activities as Student-Employed. Retired Members pay $20. Surface
mailing costs are included in the membership dues.

membership would otherwise be impossible. Contributions may be tax-deductible in various countries; check local

Prepayment is necessary; invoices are available on request. The U.S. dollar price is definitive when paying in other
currencies, although rounding off is appropriate. Checks and money orders should be made out to the Association for
Computational Linguistics (or to ACL). ALL CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS MUST BE MADE TO THE ACL
OFFICE IN THE USA; ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS ARE PREFERRED; send the information from name
through credit card above, with an identification of the items for which payment is being made, to acl@bellcore.com;
or request a form by email. Other payments can be made to one of the addresses below, as follows:

1. To Walker in the USA; mail this dues statement with credit card information or with a check or money order pay-
able to ACL. PAYMENTS MUST BE MADE IN U.S. DOLLARS, DRAWN ON A U.S. BANK OR IN U.S.
OR CANADIAN DOLLARS (CALCULATED AT THE CURRENT EXCHANGE RATE), DRAWN ON A
CANADIAN BANK.
2. To Rosner in Europe; mail this dues statement with a check or money order in Swiss francs or the equivalent in
your local currency on the day the check is written, payable to ACL. DO NOT MAKE CREDIT CARD PAY-
MENTS THROUGH EUROPE. Make sure that the check or money order is payable in Switzerland or France.
Do not issue a check or money order in U.S. dollars unless it is drawn on a U.S. Bank. Payment can also be
made by bank transfer to ACL account number 141.880.LAV at the Union Bank of Switzerland, 8 rue de Rhone,

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95450075">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.738554">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969602882352941">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language
processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the
Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, and Computational Phonology have been formed; others are likely to be
added.
