We describe the authoring tool, EasyEng-
lish, which is part of IBM&apos;s internal SGML
editing environment, Information Develop-
ment Workbench. EasyEnglish helps writ-

pointing out ambiguity and complexity as
well as performing some standard grammar
checking. Where appropriate, EasyEnglish
makes suggestions for rephrasings that may
be substituted directly into the text by us-

EasyEnglish is based on a full parse by

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999493087719299">
Like most other big corporations today, IBM is in-
terested in cost-effective, yet high-quality informa-
tion dissemination. Every year, many pages of on-
line and printed documentation are produced. No
matter what part of the world the documentation
is written in, it is normally first written in English,
and then translated into all the other supported lan-
guages. IBM has developed a number of tools to help
writers cope with this task of information develop-
ment.
In this paper, we describe EasyEnglish, a tool
that helps writers produce clearer and simpler Eng-
lish by pointing out ambiguity and complexity.
Where appropriate, EasyEnglish makes suggestions
for rephrasings. The EasyEnglish system can be
viewed as a &amp;quot;grammar checker++&amp;quot;, in that standard
grammar checking facilities such as spell-checking,
word count (sentence length), and detection of pas-
sive constructions are available in addition to the
checks for ambiguity. Furthermore, facilities for
user-defined controlled vocabulary are available. To-
tally, there are currently about forty checks.
EasyEnglish is part of IBM&apos;s internal Information
Development Workbench (IDWB), an SGML-based
document creation and document management sys-
tem. ArborText&apos;s Adept editor is used with IDWB 1.
EasyEnglish summarizes the problems encountered
in a given document by giving an overall rating, the
Clarity Index (CI). The CI has to be in a certain
range before the document can be accepted for pub-
lication.
EasyEnglish combines features from both stan-
dard grammar checkers and Controlled Language
(CL) compliance checkers with checks for structural
ambiguity in a way that we believe is general enough
to be useful for any writer., not just technical writ-
ers. It has been claimed that the restrictions found
in CLs mostly reflect the inadequacies of the MT
systems used in conjunction with CLs (Clemencin
1996; van der Eijk et al. 1996; Hayes et al. 1996). It
is certainly the case that preprocessing a document
with the same parser that is used for source analysis
improves the MT results. EasyEnglish uses the same
parser as LMT (McCord 1989a, 1989b). This offers
an obvious advantage for MT results. Other MT sys-
tems, including the KANT system (Mitamura and
Nyberg 1995; Nyberg and Mitamura 1996), see the
advantage of this. However, we claim that a docu-
ment that has been &amp;quot;EasyEnglished&amp;quot; is also easier
to understand for native speakers as well as non-
native speakers of English. A similar point has been
made for Caterpillar Technical English (Hayes et al.
1996). We think, however, that our approach is more
general because our use of a broad-coverage, general
English grammar 2 allows us to go beyond the con-
cept of CL to look for more general types of ambi-
guities.

&apos;EasyEnglish also works with the XEDIT editor on
VM and the EPM editor on OS/2. An earlier version
of EasyEnglish was written in Prolog; however, the cur-
rent version is written in pure ANSI C, and hence the
question of platform is mainly a matter of supplying an
appropriate editor interface.

2 Controlled Language Checker or
Grammar Checker?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949438596492">
The emphasis of a CL compliance checker is on
ensuring that the input text (document) conforms
to the restrictions imposed by the definition of the
CL, whereas the emphasis of a standard grammar
checker is on ensuring that the text is not ungram-
matical. Controlled Languages have been invented
to solve the problems associated with readability and
translatability, with slight regard to ensuring gram-
maticality. In fact, the point has been made that it
is up to the writer to ensure that the text is gram-
matical (Hayes et al. 1996). Or, in the words of Goy-
vaerts (1996): &amp;quot; ... it is still possible to write con-
trolled non-English.&amp;quot; A similar point has been made
for GIFAS Rationalized French (Lux and Dauphin
1996).
However, the more grammatical the text is, the
easier it is to read and translate, so it seems that
this concept of a CL checker is too narrow. On the
other hand, in many applications it may not be nec-
essary for writers to restrict themselves to a very
limited subset of English in order to write easily un-
derstandable and translatable documents. In this
sense the concept of a CL checker may be too broad.
We have developed a system that we believe
strikes a useful balance between CL checking and
standard grammar checking. It consists in restrict-
ing the CL checking to the detection of structural
(syntactic) ambiguity, complexity, and violations of
vocabulary constraints. This view is in line with the
description of Dokumentationsdeutsch in (Schachtl
1996). Dokumentationsdeutsch is not defined by a
list of allowed constructions, but rather by a list of
forbidden constructions, allowing most of standard
German syntax. In the same way, EasyEnglish al-
lows most of standard English syntax. Also (Lux
and Dauphin 1996) point out the importance of the
linguistic coverage being as broad as possible. At
the same time, we perform some of the checks that
a standard grammar checker would perform. 3
The CL checks of EasyEnglish do work better
when the text is not too ill-formed grammatically,
since ill-formedness reduces the chances of the parser
making good sense of the input. Most grammar
checkers seem to have a problem with precision, 4
and this evidently stems from the inability of the
system to make sense of the input. This is caused
not only by too narrow coverage of the parser, but
also by the ill-formed input that a standard gram-
&apos;We have conflated the notions of grammar errors and
style weaknesses. For a good discussion of the differences,
see (Ravin 1993).
&apos;We define precision to be the number of relevant er-
ror reports divided by the total number of error reports.
In other words, it is a measure of how many irrelevant
error reports the user will be bothered with. The higher
the precision, the better.
mar checker tries to deal with; it is harder to parse
non-standard constructions correctly. It has been
pointed out time and again (Richardson and Braden-
Harder 1993; Wojcik and Holmback 1996; Clemencin
1996) that user acceptance depends on suitably high
precision. Of course, the user also wants the checker
to find the problems that need to be corrected, 5
but this seems to take much lower precedence (Wo-
jcik and Holmback 1996; Clemencin 1996).
We have made a small, preliminary study compar-
ing the quality of EasyEnglish with that of Gram-
matik and the grammar checker in AmiPro. For
the study, we used a variety of text types, including
technical documents, a manager&apos;s speech, and an on-
line job advertisement written by a non-native Eng-
lish speaker. The (Precision, Recall) figures were:
EasyEnglish (0.81, 0.87), Grammatik (0.51, 0.86),
AmiPro (0.50, 0.69). There is overlap in the kinds
of checks made by these three systems, but we at-
tempted to evaluate each system on its own terms,
i.e. on the basis of the collection of checks that it
tries to do. That is, these figures show how well
each system does what it tries to do, rather than
how useful what it tries to do is. (The recall fig-
ures for Grammatik and AmiPro may be artificially
high, since we may not have been able to identify all
the problems that these grammar checkers intend to
address.)
Of course, high precision and recall alone are not
enough to ensure the usefulness of an authoring tool
such as EasyEnglish. We agree with (Adriaens and
Macken 1995; Wojcik and Holmbach 1996) that it is
also necessary to evaluate how well writers can use
the system to arrive at a satisfactory document. It
is our claim that the types of checks EasyEnglish
performs are vastly more relevant for ensuring high
document quality than a majority of the checks in
the above-mentioned grammar checkers (e.g. most
of the lexically-based checks). It has been claimed
that standard grammar checkers typically check for
stylistic issues that are relevant for writers of fic-
tion (Goyvaerts 1996). But, as Goyvaerts (1996)
puts it: &amp;quot;Industry does not need Shakespeare or
Chaucer, industry needs clear, concise communca-
tive writing — in one word Controlled Language.&amp;quot;
Of course, standard grammar checkers do also try
to supply checks that are relevant for non-fictional
genres. However, some of the standard stylistic rec-
ommendations are not entirely relevant for technical
documents at least. It is, for example, rather com-
mon for a standard grammar checker to discourage
repetition. For a company that has to pay for doc-
ument translation on a per word basis, every repeti-
&apos;We will use the term recall to mean the number of
relevant problems found divided by the number of all
problems occurring in the text. Recall thus describes
how good the checker is at identifying the problems. The
higher the recall, the better.

3 Resolution of Ambiguity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984852944954128">
EasyEnglish identifies a number of structurally am-
biguous constructions and supplies suggestions for
unambiguous rephrasings. It is then up to the user
to decide which interpretation is intended. Some
systems support automatic substitution; since we
deal with truly ambiguous constructions, we have to
involve the user in making the choice. The EasyEng-
lish editor interface, however, does allow the user
to select an offered rephrasing by mouse-clicking
and have the selection substituted automatically.
Other systems, e.g. the Attempt° System (Fuchs and
Schwitter 1996), present the user with a rephrasing
that illustrates which interpretation the system ar-
rived at. If that interpretation is not the desired one,
it is up to the user to construct a rephrasing that will
result in the desired interpretation. We think it is
more user-friendly to show the user exactly how the
construction may be ambiguous and let her make
her own choice.
In order for the disambiguation rules to work
properly, it is crucial to have a deep analysis of the
text. This deep analysis is provided by English Slot
Grammar (ESG) (McCord 1980, 1990, 1993) in the
form of parse trees expressed as a network struc-
ture. The disambiguation rules explore the network
to spot ambiguous and potentially ambiguous con-
structions.
ESG often provides more than one parse, ranked
according to a specific numerical ranking system
(McCord 1990, 1993). But, unlike some other sys-
tems, e.g. the Boeing Simplified English Checker
(Wojcik and Holmback 1996), which look at a whole
forest of trees, it is only necessary for EasyEnglish
to look at the highest-ranked parse. ESG parsing
heuristics often arrive at correct attachments in the
highest-ranked parse. But even when the attach-
ment is off, EasyEnglish can often point out other
attachment possibilities to the writer. For exam-
ple, if a present participial clause is attached to the
object of a verb, there will also be the possibility
that the participial clause actually should modify
the subject instead. However, it is not necessary
for the parse to reflect this, since this can be re-
flected in the EasyEnglish rule instead. A simplistic
view of this rule would be: &amp;quot;If a present participial
clause modifies the object, suggest two rephrasings,
one that forces the attachment to the subject, and
one that forces the attachment to the object&amp;quot;.
An example taken from an IBM manual: &amp;quot;Differ-
ent system users may operate on different objects
using the same application program.&amp;quot;
This sentence generates the following message:
Ambiguous attachment of verb phrase: &amp;quot;us-
ing the same application program&amp;quot;.
Who/what is &amp;quot;using the same applica-
tion program&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Different system users&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;different objects&amp;quot; ?
If &amp;quot;Different system users&amp;quot;, a possible
rephrasing would be: &amp;quot;by using the same
application program&amp;quot;;
If &amp;quot;different objects&amp;quot;, a possible rephrasing
would be: &amp;quot;different objects that use the
same application program&amp;quot;.
Notice the additional benefit we get from basing
the suggestion on a parse: the correct subject-verb
agreement can be inferred for use in the suggestions.
Coordination is another source of ambiguity, since
the scope is not always clear. One type of ambiguity
occurs when a conjoined noun phrase premodifies a
noun, as in this example from an IBM manual:
&amp;quot;It is the number defined in the file or result field
definition. &amp;quot;
The phrase &amp;quot;file or result field definition&amp;quot; is am-
biguous in many ways, as is shown by the output
from EasyEnglish:
Ambiguity in: &amp;quot;the file or result field defi-
nition&amp;quot;. Possible rephrasings:
&amp;quot;the result field definition or the file&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;the file definition or the result field defin-
ition&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;the file field definition or the result field
definition&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;the definition of the file&apos; or of the result
field&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;the field definition of the file or of the
result&amp;quot;
Another type of ambiguity in coordination con-
cerns combinations of coordinating conjunctions, as
illustrated by the following example: &amp;quot;The cat and
the rat or the mat sat.&amp;quot;
Ambiguous coordination; possible rephras-
ings: &amp;quot;Either the cat and the rat or the
mat&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;The cat and either the rat or the mat&amp;quot;
The above cases illustrate constructions that are
definitely ambiguous; however, some common prob-
lems involve modification that may or may not be
correct, depending on domain knowledge, which we
do not attempt to make use of at present.
For example, the implicit subject in a nonfinite
clause premodifying the main clause should be the
same as the subject of the main clause. It is gener-
ally not possible to tell, on the basis of syntax alone,
whether the author has adhered to this rule. But it
is possible to alert the user to the potential problem.
The following two examples illustrate the problem.
The first example, taken from an IBM manual, is
okay, whereas the second example, taken from (Led-
erer 1989), is not okay.

An earlier version of EasyEnglish, written in Pro-
log, included a pronoun resolution module, RAP
(Lappin and McCord 1990a,b; Lappin and Leass
1994). This module, originally written for use with
LMT, was modified slightly to point out ambiguous
pronominal references. It has not yet been included
in the C version of EasyEnglish, and we give here
an example of its use produced by the Prolog ver-
sion. The example is taken from (Lederer 1989):
&amp;quot;Guilt, vengeance, and bitterness can be emotion-
ally destructive to you and your children. You must
get rid of them.&amp;quot;
This generates the following message:

4 Vocabulary Functions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971359375">
EasyEnglish comes with a built-in general English
dictionary of about 80,000 words. In addition,
EasyEnglish has a flexible system for using dictio-
naries as it does its analysis. Users can specify in a
user profile which dictionaries they want to call up.
The specification can include any number of term
dictionaries, any number of abbreviation dictionar-
ies, any number of non-allowed word dictionaries,
and any number of controlled vocabulary dictionar-
ies. There are EasyEnglish commands for compiling
a user-maintainable format of these different kinds
of dictionaries into efficiently useable forms, and for
creating abbreviation dictionaries from terminology
dictionaries in maintainance form.
The dictionaries support three different types of
vocabulary checks. The first vocabulary check looks
for restricted words, i.e. words that the writer ei-
ther should never use, or that the writer should only
use as certain parts-of-speech. The user may spec-
ify these words in a specific user dictionary along
with preferred alternatives. In addition, this cate-
gory includes slang words, a list of which is system-
supplied. The second type of vocabulary check iden-
tifies acronyms or abbreviations in the text and
checks to see that the first occurrence is properly
spelled out according to the definition supplied in
the user dictionary for&apos; acronyms. The third check
gives the user the option to specify a controlled vo-
cabulary; all words that are not in the controlled-
vocabulary file or that are improperly used with re-
spect to part-of-speech will be flagged, should the
user decide to turn this check on. User dictionaries
for restricted words, acronyms, and controlled vo-
cabulary have been built for the IDWB for certain
domains.
The vocabulary checks rely on two things: the
parser and user dictionaries. It is crucial to be able
to determine the applicable part of speech with ac-
curacy. Take for example the word &amp;quot;beef&amp;quot;. If this
is used as a verb (&amp;quot;they beef a lot&amp;quot;), it should be
flagged as slang; on the other hand, if it is used as
a noun (&amp;quot;he ate beef&amp;quot;), it should not be flagged. A
full parse helps decide on this.
User dictionaries may be built with the help of the
separate terms module, ETerms, which is run inde-
pendently of EasyEnglish. ETerms identifies candi-
dates for new terms by looking for words not found in
any of the dictionaries6 as well as multinoun terms.
The output from ETerms is very accurate due to
the use of full ESG parsing. For each term, the fre-
quency is stated, and the user has the choice be-
tween having the terms sorted either in frequency
order or alphabetical order. The terms file has a
format that is directly usable as a user dictionary;
however, to keep terminology consistent and remove
misspellings, it is necessary that a terminologist ap-
prove the content before actual use.
The terms file may also be sent to the IBM trans-
lation centers at an early stage. This speeds up the
task of translation considerably, since their terminol-
ogists can decide on the proper translations before
the translators actually start the translation process.
This list is also a good start on an online bilingual
dictionary for an MT system.

5 Standard Grammar Checking
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999579">
In addition to spotting ambiguity and providing
terminological support, EasyEnglish also performs
more traditional grammar checking. It is a deli-
cate balance to process text that has grammatical
errors; the parser needs to be able to make reason-
ably good sense of the text in order for the checking
component not to overflag problems. The grammat-
ical checks fall into three different categories, which
we will treat separately: Syntactic problems, lexical
problems, and punctuation problems.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994269">
5.1 Syntactic problems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999902375">
This category is obviously the category most sensi-
tive to parsing problems. However, we have found
that a number of checks can be implemented success-
fully, including, but not limited to, checks for lack
of parallelism in coordination and in list elements,
passives, double negatives, long sentences, incom-
plete sentences, wrong pronoun case, and long noun
strings.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9660585">
6Since these could also be misspellings, they are also
flagged by EasyEnglish itself.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.995519">
162
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999208418604651">
To illustrate the function of these checks, let us
look at the checks for passives. When a passive
construction is encountered, an active transforma-
tion provides the desired suggested rephrasing, pro-
vided the logical subject is available. If the logical
subject is not available, the passive is pointed out,
but no rephrasing is offered. Some standard gram-
mar checkers insist on supplying an active rephrasing
even in this case, and they do that by introducing a
fake subject &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;they&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;. In our view, this
rarely provides a reasonable iephrasing.
The following sentence from an IBM manual illus-
trates both cases: &amp;quot;The format is defined in the file
which was not included by the header file.&amp;quot;
This sentence generates two messages for the pas-
sives, one without a rephrasing, and one with a
rephrasing:
Passive construction: &amp;quot;is defined in the file
which was not included by the header file&amp;quot;.
Passive construction: &amp;quot;was not included
by the header file&amp;quot;. Possible rephrasing:
&amp;quot;which the header file did not include&amp;quot;
The parse supplies the information necessary to
decide on the correct word order and tense used in
the rephrasing.
In the case of a double passive, there is the ad-
ditional problem of ambiguity, as illustrated by the
following example from (Lederer 1989): &amp;quot;Two cars
were reported stolen by the Groveton police yester-
day.&amp;quot; 7
Ambiguous passive construction. Is the
subject of &amp;quot;stolen&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;the Groveton police&amp;quot;?
In contrast to this group of syntactic problems, a
check for subject-verb agreement is much harder to
implement reliably. This is due to the ambiguity of
part-of-speech that is so prevalent in English. Many
verbs can also be nouns and vice versa. When there
then is a mistake in subject-verb agreement, it be-
comes very hard to produce a reliable parse. (We are
assuming a strictly syntactic approach). Standard
grammar checkers seem to have even worse prob-
lems with this check (on the order of a precision of
less than 10 percent).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999525">
5.2 Lexical Problems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991075">
Lexical problems, on the other hand, are not very
much affected by bad parses and can be spotted with
a high degree of reliability. These include misspelled
or unknown words, duplicated words, and the like.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998237">
5.3 Punctuation

6 The Use of Formatting Tags
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999295">
EasyEnglish works with SGML, Bookmaster, or IPF
formats as well as with plain text. Dealing with
formatting tags is a necessary, but rather complex,
task, which is often underestimated (as pointed out
by Clemencin (1996)). But the trouble of building
a good tag-handling system is well-rewarded. For-
matting tags are of great help in the segmentation
process and may be enlisted for identifying condi-
tions such as missing periods (or other sentence de-
limiters) and lack of parallelism in lists, both of
which are handled by EasyEnglish. It is also useful
to be able to identify tables and displays, thereby
allowing differential treatment of them. Further-
more, it can be helpful for the parser to take the
tags into account, especially quote and highlighting
tags, which may delimit complete phrases; header
tags can influence the parser to prefer noun phrase
analyses over sentence analysis.
Another, very important, use of formatting tags is
checking of revised text only. The so-called revis i on
tags indicate revisions to earlier versions of the doc-
ument. Being able to properly identify revised parts
means that the user can elect to check only revised
parts. This is a great time saver, considering the
extensive use of previously written documents in a
technical environment (Means and Godden 1996).

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996204">
One of our greatest concerns has been to provide a
system that is both useful and acceptable to the user.
We have addressed this issue on four fronts: High
precision, generality of the problem types EasyEng-
lish is able to identify, customizability, and user-
friendly interfaces. High precision is attained by
the use of a high-quality, robust, broad coverage
grammar (ESG) that delivers dependably consistent
parses with great detail. Generality is attained by
addressing generally ambiguous constructions rather
than restricting ourselves to a specific CL. This way,
the user does not have to learn a CL, either, which
can be a quite difficult task (Wojcik and Holmback
1996; van der Eijk et al. 1996; Douglas and Hurst
1996; Goyvaerts 1996). Customizability is attained
by allowing the user to specify in a user profile which
checks should be applied, as well as which user dic-
tionaries should be used. User-friendliness is at-
tained by integrating EasyEnglish with suitable edit-
ing environments in such a way as to make changes
easy, and to keep the EasyEnglish information up-
to-date with these changes. Error statistics are con-
stantly updated as the user corrects mistakes, so
that once a mistake is corrected the user will not
be bothered with it again.

<bodyText confidence="0.999859777777778">
Judging from the feedback from our users, this
approach seems to have paid off. Users generally ex-
press enthusiasm about using EasyEnglish, and the
IBM translation centers have reported that they find
the &amp;quot;EasyEnglished&amp;quot; documents easier to deal with.
This is informal evidence that our goal of easing the
task of translation has been accomplished; however,
we still need to make formal studies to be able to
quantify the exact savings.

EasyEnglish helps writers produce clearer and simpler English by pointing out ambiguity and complexity as well as performing some standard grammar checking. Where appropriate, EasyEnglish makes suggestions for rephrasings that may be substituted directly into the text by using the editor interface. EasyEnglish is based on a full parse by English Slot Grammar; this makes it possible to produce a higher degree of accuracy in error messages as well as handle a large variety of texts.</abstract>

That is, these figures show how well each system does what it tries to do, rather than how useful what it tries to do is. (The recall figures for Grammatik and AmiPro may be artificially high, since we may not have been able to identify all the problems that these grammar checkers intend to address.) Of course, high precision and recall alone are not enough to ensure the usefulness of an authoring tool such as EasyEnglish. We agree with (Adriaens and Macken 1995; Wojcik and Holmbach 1996) that it is also necessary to evaluate how well writers can use the system to arrive at a satisfactory document. It is our claim that the types of checks EasyEnglish performs are vastly more relevant for ensuring high document quality than a majority of the checks in the above-mentioned grammar checkers (e.g. most of the lexically-based checks). It has been claimed that standard grammar checkers typically check for stylistic issues that are relevant for writers of fiction (Goyvaerts 1996).

EasyEnglish summarizes the problems encountered in a given document by giving an overall rating, the Clarity Index (CI). The CI has to be in a certain range before the document can be accepted for publication. EasyEnglish combines features from both standard grammar checkers and Controlled Language (CL) compliance checkers with checks for structural ambiguity in a way that we believe is general enough to be useful for any writer., not just technical writers. It has been claimed that the restrictions found in CLs mostly reflect the inadequacies of the MT systems used in conjunction with CLs (Clemencin 1996; van der Eijk et al. 1996; Hayes et al. 1996). It is certainly the case that preprocessing a document with the same parser that is used for source analysis improves the MT results. EasyEnglish uses the same parser as LMT (McCord 1989a, 1989b). This offers an obvious advantage for MT results. Other MT systems, including the KANT system (Mitamura and Nyberg 1995; Nyberg and Mitamura 1996), see the advantage of this. However, we claim that a document that has been &amp;quot;EasyEnglished&amp;quot; is also easier to understand for native speakers as well as nonnative speakers of English. A similar point has been m</context>

For a good discussion of the differences, see (Ravin 1993). &apos;We define precision to be the number of relevant error reports divided by the total number of error reports. In other words, it is a measure of how many irrelevant error reports the user will be bothered with. The higher the precision, the better. mar checker tries to deal with; it is harder to parse non-standard constructions correctly. It has been pointed out time and again (Richardson and BradenHarder 1993; Wojcik and Holmback 1996; Clemencin 1996) that user acceptance depends on suitably high precision. Of course, the user also wants the checker to find the problems that need to be corrected, 5 but this seems to take much lower precedence (Wojcik and Holmback 1996; Clemencin 1996). We have made a small, preliminary study comparing the quality of EasyEnglish with that of Grammatik and the grammar checker in AmiPro. For the study, we used a variety of text types, including technical documents, a manager&apos;s speech, and an online job advertisement written by a non-native English speaker. The (Precision, Recall) figures were: EasyEnglish (0.</context>

Dealing with formatting tags is a necessary, but rather complex, task, which is often underestimated (as pointed out by Clemencin (1996)). But the trouble of building a good tag-handling system is well-rewarded. Formatting tags are of great help in the segmentation process and may be enlisted for identifying conditions such as missing periods (or other sentence delimiters) and lack of parallelism in lists, both of which are handled by EasyEnglish. It is also useful to be able to identify tables and displays, thereby allowing differential treatment of them. Furthermore, it can be helpful for the parser to take the tags into account, especially quote and highlighting tags, which may delimit complete phrases; header tags can infl</context>

We have addressed this issue on four fronts: High precision, generality of the problem types EasyEnglish is able to identify, customizability, and userfriendly interfaces. High precision is attained by the use of a high-quality, robust, broad coverage grammar (ESG) that delivers dependably consistent parses with great detail. Generality is attained by addressing generally ambiguous constructions rather than restricting ourselves to a specific CL. This way, the user does not have to learn a CL, either, which can be a quite difficult task (Wojcik and Holmback 1996; van der Eijk et al. 1996; Douglas and Hurst 1996; Goyvaerts 1996). Customizability is attained by allowing the user to specify in a user profile which checks should be applied, as well as which user dictionaries should be used. User-friendliness is attained by integrating EasyEnglish with suitable editing environments in such a way as to make changes easy, and to keep the EasyEnglish information upto-date with these changes. Error statistics are constantly updated as the user corrects mistakes, so that once a mistake is corrected the user will not be bothered with it again. 163 Judging from the feedback from our users, this approach seems t</context>

It is then up to the user to decide which interpretation is intended. Some systems support automatic substitution; since we deal with truly ambiguous constructions, we have to involve the user in making the choice. The EasyEnglish editor interface, however, does allow the user to select an offered rephrasing by mouse-clicking and have the selection substituted automatically. Other systems, e.g. the Attempt° System (Fuchs and Schwitter 1996), present the user with a rephrasing that illustrates which interpretation the system arrived at. If that interpretation is not the desired one, it is up to the user to construct a rephrasing that will result in the desired interpretation. We think it is more user-friendly to show the user exactly how the construction may be ambiguous and let her make her own choice. In order for the disambiguation rules to work properly, it is crucial to have a deep analysis of the text. This deep analysis is provided by English Slot Grammar (ESG) (McCord 1980, 1990, 1993) in the form of parse trees expressed</context>

For example, the implicit subject in a nonfinite clause premodifying the main clause should be the same as the subject of the main clause. It is generally not possible to tell, on the basis of syntax alone, whether the author has adhered to this rule. But it is possible to alert the user to the potential problem. The following two examples illustrate the problem.

Passive construction: &amp;quot;was not included by the header file&amp;quot;. Possible rephrasing: &amp;quot;which the header file did not include&amp;quot; The parse supplies the information necessary to decide on the correct word order and tense used in the rephrasing.

In contrast to this group of syntactic problems, a check for subject-verb agreement is much harder to implement reliably. This is due to the ambiguity of part-of-speech that is so prevalent in English. Many verbs can also be nouns and vice versa.

However, the more grammatical the text is, the easier it is to read and translate, so it seems that this concept of a CL checker is too narrow. On the other hand, in many applications it may not be necessary for writers to restrict themselves to a very limited subset of English in order to write easily understandable and translatable documents.

If that interpretation is not the desired one, it is up to the user to construct a rephrasing that will result in the desired interpretation. We think it is more user-friendly to show the user exactly how the construction may be ambiguous and let her make her own choice. In order for the disambiguation rules to work properly, it is crucial to have a deep analysis of the text. This deep analysis is provided by English Slot Grammar (ESG) (McCord 1980, 1990, 1993) in the form of parse trees expressed as a network structure. The disambiguation rules explore the network to spot ambiguous and potentially ambiguous constructions. ESG often provides more than one parse, ranked according to a specific numerical ranking system (McCord 1990, 1993). But, unlike some other systems, e.g. the Boeing Simplified English Checker (Wojcik and Holmback 1996), which look at a whole forest of trees, it is only necessary for EasyEnglish to look at the highest-ranked parse. ESG parsing heuristics often arrive at correct attachments in the highest-ranked parse. </context>

Another, very important, use of formatting tags is checking of revised text only. The so-called revis i on tags indicate revisions to earlier versions of the document. Being able to properly identify revised parts means that the user can elect to check only revised parts. This is a great time saver, considering the extensive use of previously written documents in a technical environment (Means and Godden 1996). 7 Conclusion One of our greatest concerns has been to provide a system that is both useful and acceptable to the user. We have addressed this issue on four fronts: High precision, generality of the problem types EasyEnglish is able to identify, customizability, and userfriendly interfaces. High precision is attained by the use of a high-quality, robust, broad coverage grammar (ESG) that delivers dependably consistent parses with great detail. Generality is attained by addressing generally ambiguous constructions rather than restricting ourselves to a specific CL. This way, the user does not </context>

In this sense the concept of a CL checker may be too broad. We have developed a system that we believe strikes a useful balance between CL checking and standard grammar checking. It consists in restricting the CL checking to the detection of structural (syntactic) ambiguity, complexity, and violations of vocabulary constraints. This view is in line with the description of Dokumentationsdeutsch in (Schachtl 1996). Dokumentationsdeutsch is not defined by a list of allowed constructions, but rather by a list of forbidden constructions, allowing most of standard German syntax. In the same way, EasyEnglish allows most of standard English syntax. Also (Lux and Dauphin 1996) point out the importance of the linguistic coverage being as broad as possible. At the same time, we perform some of the checks that a standard grammar checker would perform. 3 The CL checks of EasyEnglish do work better when the text is not too ill-formed grammatically, since ill-formedness reduces the chances of the parser making good</context>

For a good discussion of the differences, see (Ravin 1993). &apos;We define precision to be the number of relevant error reports divided by the total number of error reports. In other words, it is a measure of how many irrelevant error reports the user will be bothered with. The higher the precision, the better. mar checker tries to deal with; it is harder to parse non-standard constructions correctly. It has been pointed out time and again (Richardson and BradenHarder 1993; Wojcik and Holmback 1996; Clemencin 1996) that user acceptance depends on suitably high precision. Of course, the user also wants the checker to find the problems that need to be corrected, 5 but this seems to take much lower precedence (Wojcik and Holmback 1996; Clemencin 1996). We have made a small, preliminary study comparing the quality of EasyEnglish with that of Grammatik and the grammar checker in AmiPro. For the study, we used a variety of text types, including technical documents, a manager&apos;s speech, and an online job advertisement written by a non-native English speaker. The (Precision, Recall) figures were</context>

In order for the disambiguation rules to work properly, it is crucial to have a deep analysis of the text. This deep analysis is provided by English Slot Grammar (ESG) (McCord 1980, 1990, 1993) in the form of parse trees expressed as a network structure. The disambiguation rules explore the network to spot ambiguous and potentially ambiguous constructions. ESG often provides more than one parse, ranked according to a specific numerical ranking system (McCord 1990, 1993). But, unlike some other systems, e.g. the Boeing Simplified English Checker (Wojcik and Holmback 1996), which look at a whole forest of trees, it is only necessary for EasyEnglish to look at the highest-ranked parse. ESG parsing heuristics often arrive at correct attachments in the highest-ranked parse. But even when the attachment is off, EasyEnglish can often point out other attachment possibilities to the writer. For example, if a present participial clause is attached to the object of a verb, there will also be the possibility that the participial clause actually should modify the subject instead. However, it is not necessary for the parse to reflect this, since this can be reflected in th</context>

We have addressed this issue on four fronts: High precision, generality of the problem types EasyEnglish is able to identify, customizability, and userfriendly interfaces. High precision is attained by the use of a high-quality, robust, broad coverage grammar (ESG) that delivers dependably consistent parses with great detail. Generality is attained by addressing generally ambiguous constructions rather than restricting ourselves to a specific CL. This way, the user does not have to learn a CL, either, which can be a quite difficult task (Wojcik and Holmback 1996; van der Eijk et al. 1996; Douglas and Hurst 1996; Goyvaerts 1996). Customizability is attained by allowing the user to specify in a user profile which checks should be applied, as well as which user dictionaries should be used. User-friendliness is attained by integrating EasyEnglish with suitable editing environments in such a way as to make changes easy, and to keep the EasyEnglish information upto-date with these changes. Error statistics are constantly updated as the user corrects mistakes, so that once a mistake is corrected the user will not be bothered with it again. 163 Judging from </context>
