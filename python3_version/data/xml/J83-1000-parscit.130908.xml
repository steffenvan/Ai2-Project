A Note from the Editor:
This is the first issue of Volume 9 of the American Journal of Computational Linguistics,
and the first issue under my editorship. It is regrettably late, as a result of the complexi-
ties involved in transferring the files and in reorganizing the procedures for handling
papers. It is my intention to bring the Journal back onto schedule by the end of 1984.
Doing that may require putting out several double issues to economize on production and
distribution delays, but that will not lessen the number of pages included in a volume.
Depending on the number of such double issues, this means there will be five to seven
issues published during 1984.
There are several changes I have made in the organization of the Journal. Some of
these relate to streamlining the processing of submissions, while others deal with the
content of the Journal itself. With regard to processing papers, the editorial board has
agreed to review papers within three weeks of their receipt and I have been enforcing that
deadline. Given the time taken to select appropriate referees and to carry out other
management tasks, this means that we can process a paper from receipt by the editor to
acceptance or rejection in approximately three months. In fact, since I have assumed the
editorship, we have completed processing of ten papers with an average turnaround of 82
days from the date of receipt. Given the increased publication rate over the next year,
there will be virtually no delay from final acceptance to publication. Thus this is an ideal
time to get a paper published in a short time, probably within six months form the date of
submission!
The Journal itself will start to change over the next year as a result of a complete new
line of editorial staff. Ralph Weischedel is now The Finite String editor and Lyn Bates is
the new Book Review editor. See their statements in this issue at the beginning of their
sections. As for my part of the Journal, I want to encourage more Technical Correspon-
dences and Letters to the Editor. Technical Correspondences provide an ideal place to
describe preliminary results of a project or the results of a study relevant to computatiqn-
al linguistics. Letters include extensive discussion on a matter of opinion. Responses to
both Technical Correspondences and Letters will be actively encouraged.
I also want to encourage special issues on topics in computational linguistics. These
will usually be administered by a Guest Editor, although all submissions will still be
subject to review by the Editorial Board as usual. If you are interested in editing such an
issue, or have a suggestion of a topic area for an issue, please contact me.
As of the first issue of 1984 (Volume 10), the name of the Journal will be changed to
Computational Linguistics to reflect its international nature. We will be increasing the
proportion of non-American members on the Editorial Board over the next few years and
hope to attract many more submissions from outside the U. S.
As you can see, the next year will be one of considerable activity and change for the
Journal. Any suggestions and comments you have on what we plan to do, what we are
doing, or what we should be doing will be greatly appreciated. I thank you for your
patience and look forward to guiding the Journal through this exciting time. I trust we
will all contribute towards keeping the AJCL the foremost source covering computational
linguistics.

Guidelines for Formatting Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998282714285714">
Manuscripts submitted to the American Journal of Computational Linguistics should be
typed on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inch or A4), double-spaced throughout, including
footnotes and references. The full first name and initial of each author should be
provided, followed by the corresponding institutions and complete mailing addresses.
Manuscripts must be submitted in English.
The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
It should state the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principle
conclusions and recommendations. It is preferable that the abstract not be in the first
person, and it should not contain any mathematical notation or cite references. Work
planned but not completed should not appear. Since the abstract will be used to select
appropriate referees, it is essential to make it as informative as possible.
References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the paper according
to the following style, where the naming convention is &apos;Surname, Firstname Initial.&apos; and
multiple authors are separated by semicolons, the last one being preceded by &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;:

References in the text should have the form `surname(s) (date)&apos;, for example &amp;quot;Smith and

entheses, for example &amp;quot;The system EZPARSE (Smith and Jones 1963) ...&amp;quot;.
continued overleaf
Footnotes should be avoided as much as possible. Whenever it does not impede the logic
or readability of the paper, footnote material should be integrated into the text. When
necessary, they should be numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article and
appear at the bottom of the page on which they are referenced.
Notation should be selected so as to simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures
should be devised with consideration for whether they would require one column or two
columns in the text. All figures in the final manuscript will be the author&apos;s responsibility.
For initial submission of papers for refereeing, the figures should be integrated into the
text as much as possible, rather than being inserted at the end of the document. Original
line drawings must be drawn in black ink on white paper; the lines should be heavy
enough to reproduce well. Photographs should be in black and white on glossy paper.
Computer printout is not acceptable for figures; any such copy should be redone in a
comparable type font.
AJCL is interested in exploring the use of electronic submission for the final manuscript,
for those able to produce and transmit copy in that form. We are prepared to handle
both tape and network transmissions. For such a submission, it is essential to reduce the
problems entailed in introducing format commands. The easiest situation for our Prod-
uction Editor at the present is to eliminate all such commands, separating sections that
are handled differently by blank lines. It is, of course, essential to accompany the
electronic transmission with a graphic version that indicates the preferred format. It
should be recognized that deviations from personal preferences may occur in the interest
of ensuring a more consistent style for the Journal. Electronic submissions should be sent
directly to the Production Editor at the mailing or net addresses provided on the inside
front cover.

Ralph Weischedel is now The Finite String editor and Lyn Bates is the new Book Review editor. See their statements in this issue at the beginning of their sections. As for my part of the Journal, I want to encourage more Technical Correspondences and Letters to the Editor. Technical Correspondences provide an ideal place to describe preliminary results of a project or the results of a study relevant to computatiqnal linguistics. Letters include extensive discussion on a matter of opinion. Responses to both Technical Correspondences and Letters will be actively encouraged. I also want to encourage special issues on topics in computational linguistics. These will usually be administered by a Guest Editor, although all submissions will still be subject to review by the Editorial Board as usual. If you are interested in editing such an issue, or have a suggestion of a topic area for an issue, please contact me. As of the first issue of 1984 (Volume 10), the name of the Journal will be changed to Linguistics reflect its international nature. We will be increasing the proportion of non-American members on the Editorial Board over the next few years and hope to attract many more submissions from outside the U. S. As you can see, the next year will be one of considerable activity and change for the Journal. Any suggestions and comments you have on what we plan to do, what we are doing, or what we should be doing will be greatly appreciated. I thank you for your patience and look forward to guiding the Journal through this exciting time. I trust we all contribute towards keeping the foremost source covering computational linguistics. James F. Allen, Editor Guidelines for Formatting Submissions submitted to the Journal of Computational Linguistics be typed on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inch or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The full first name and initial of each author should be provided, followed by the corresponding institutions and complete mailing addresses. Manuscripts must be submitted in English. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. It should state the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principle conclusions and recommendations. It is preferable that the abstract not be in the first person, and it should not contain any mathematical notation or cite references. Work planned but not completed should not appear. Since the abstract will be used to select appropriate referees, it is essential to make it as informative as possible. References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the paper according to the following style, where the naming convention is &apos;Surname, Firstname Initial.&apos; and multiple authors are separated by semicolons, the last one being preceded by &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;: Articlein journal: Name. Year. Title (in initial capitals). Periodical-name (identified by underlining or italics) Volume(Issue-number): page#-page#.</abstract>

Whenever it does not impede the logic or readability of the paper, footnote material should be integrated into the text. When necessary, they should be numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article and appear at the bottom of the page on which they are referenced. Notation should be selected so as to simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures should be devised with consideration for whether they would require one column or two columns in the text. All figures in the final manuscript will be the author&apos;s responsibility. For initial submission of papers for refereeing, the figures should be integrated into the text as much as possible, rather than being inserted at the end of the document. Original line drawings must be drawn in black ink on white paper; the lines should be heavy enough to reproduce well. Photographs should be in black and white on glossy paper. printout is for figures; any such copy should be redone in a comparable type font. interested in exploring the use of electronic submission for the final manuscript, for those able to produce and transmit copy in that form. We are prepared to handle both tape and network transmissions. For such a submission, it is essential to reduce the problems entailed in introducing format commands. The easiest situation for our Production Editor at the present is to eliminate all such commands, separating sections that are handled differently by blank lines. It is, of course, essential to accompany the electronic transmission with a graphic version that indicates the preferred format. It should be recognized that deviations from personal preferences may occur in the interest of ensuring a more consistent style for the Journal. Electronic submissions should be sent directly to the Production Editor at the mailing or net addresses provided on the inside front cover.</abstract>
