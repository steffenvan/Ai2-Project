Phylogenetic analyses of languages need to
explicitly address whether the languages un-
der consideration are related to each other at
all. Recently developed permutation tests al-
low this question to be explored by testing
whether words in one set of languages are
significantly more similar to those in another
set of languages when paired up by seman-
tics than when paired up at random. Seven
different phonetic similarity metrics are im-
plemented and evaluated on their effective-
ness within such multilateral comparison
systems when deployed to detect genetic re-
lations among the Indo-European and Uralic
language families.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999648">
Because the historical development of languages is
analogous to the evolution of organisms, linguists
and biologists have been able to share much of their
cladistic theory and practice. But in at least one
respect, linguists are at a disadvantage. While all
cellular organisms on Earth are patently related to
each other, no such assumption can be made for lan-
guages. It is possible that languages were invented
multiple times, so that the proper cladistic analy-
sis of all human languages comprises a forest rather
than a single tree. Therefore historical linguists un-
dertaking a cladistic analysis – more often referred
to as subgrouping – have to ask a question that rarely
arises at all in biology: Are the entities for which I
am undertaking to draw a family tree related to each
other in the first place?
The question of whether two or more languages
are related is addressed by looking at characters that
differ between languages and asking whether ob-
served similarities in those characters are so great
as to lead to the conclusion that the languages have
a common ancestor. Researchers have investigated
many types of characters for this purpose, includ-
ing fairly abstract ones such as the structure of
paradigms, but the most commonly used charac-
ters have been the individual morphemes of the lan-
guage. Morphemes are associations between strings
of phones and specific language functions such as
lexical meanings or more general grammatical prop-
erties. Crucially, those associations are arbitrary
to a very great extent. Knowing that a ‘tree’ is
/strom/ in Czech will not help one figure out that it
is /ets/ in Hebrew; nor should Hebrew speakers con-
fronted with two Czech lexical morphemes, such as
/strom/ vs /❍rad/, be able to guess which one means
‘tree’ and which one means ‘castle’. An implica-
tion of this arbitrariness is that if one pairs mor-
phemes by meaning between two languages, that
set of pairs should not have any systematic phonetic
property that would not be obtained if morphemes
were paired up without regard to meaning. Thus, if
one does observe some systematic phonetic property
across the semantically paired morphemes, one can
conclude that there is some historical contingency
that gave those languages that property. Namely, one
can conclude that at one time the languages shared
the same morpheme for at least some of the mean-
ings, either because of borrowing or because of de-
scent from a common ancestor.
The most straightforward application of this prin-

ciple is to see whether the morphemes for the same
concept in two different languages appear unusu-
ally similar to each other. Anyone seeing that the
morpheme for ‘all’ was /æal:/ in Old English and
/al:/ in Old High German, that ‘animal’ was /de:or/
and /tior/, respectively, and that ‘back’ was /hryd:Z/
vs. /hruk:/, and so forth, might well conclude that
the languages were related to each other, as indeed
they were. Unfortunately, the universal properties
of language mean that even unrelated morphemes
have something in common; it is not always obvious
whether the amount of similarity between seman-
tically matched morphemes is significantly greater
than that between semantically mismatched mor-
phemes. For nearly two centuries now, the standard
recourse in case of doubt has been the comparative
method. One counts how many times the same pair
of sounds match up in semantically matched mor-
phemes; for example, Old English /d/ often corre-
sponds to Old High German /t/. A large number of
recurrent sound correspondences appearing in sev-
eral positions in a large number of different words
has been considered proof that languages are related.
This method is more sophisticated than eyeballing
similarities, not least because it recognizes the effect
of phonetic apomorphies − sound changes − such
as the change of /d/ to /t/ in Old High German. The
standard methodology gives no concrete guidance as
to how many recurrent sound correspondences con-
stitute proof. However, there have been attempts
to recast the comparative method in terms of mod-
ern statistical theory and experimental methodology,
providing clearcut quantification of the magnitude
and significance of the evidence that languages are
related (see Kessler, 2001, for recent developments
and a summary of earlier work).
One drawback to recent statistical adaptations of
the comparative method is that they have been lim-
ited to comparing two languages at a time. It has
been claimed, however, most prominently by Green-
berg (e.g., 1993), that when one wishes to test
whether a large set of languages are related, con-
ducting a series of bilateral tests loses power: there
may be information contained in a pattern of rela-
tions across three or more languages that is not man-
ifest in the bilateral partitioning of the set of lan-
guages. Greenberg’s approach to multilateral com-
parison was a step backward to the days before the
development of the comparative method (Poser &amp;
Campbell, 1992). By his own account, he simply
eyed the data and apparently never failed to conclude
that languages were related.
Most linguists have rejected Greenberg’s ap-
proach and many have written detailed refutations
(e.g., Campbell, 1988; Matisoff, 1990; Ringe, 1996;
Salmons, 1992). But Kessler and Lehtonen (2006)
believed that multilateral comparison could be valid
and advantageous if applied with some statistical
rigour. Adapting Greenberg’s basic approach, they
developed a methodology that involved computing
phonetic similarity between semantically matched
morphemes across several languages at a time. This
was different from the comparative method, because
recurrent sound correspondences were not sought:
large numbers of recurrences are not typically found
across large numbers of languages. However, it
is conceptually straightforward to aggregate sim-
ilarity measures across morphemes in many lan-
guages. Crucially, the similarity across semantically
matched morphemes was compared to that obtained
across semantically mismatched morphemes. Thus,
this application of multilateral comparison is based
on the same principles about sound−meaning ar-
bitrariness on which the comparative method was
based. Because the similarity computations were
completely algorithmic and applied to data collected
in an unbiased fashion, the new methodology pro-
vided a way to reliably quantify and test the signif-
icance of phonetic similarity as evidence for histor-
ical connections between two sets of multiple lan-
guages. Kessler and Lehtonen demonstrated that the
method was powerful enough to detect the relation-
ship between 11 Indo-European languages and that
between 4 Uralic languages, but it did not detect any
connection between those two families.
The core of the multilateral comparison method-
ology is the phonetic similary metric. To my knowl-
edge, Greenberg never specified any particular met-
ric. However, many different phonetic comparison
algoriths have been proposed for many purposes,
including this task of looking for similarities be-
tween words (reviewed in Kessler, 2005); in partic-
ular, Baxter and Manaster Ramer (2000) and Oswalt
(1998) developed algorithms expressly for investi-
gating language relatedness, though only in bilat-
eral tests. In this paper I explore several different

2 Multilateral Comparison

<bodyText confidence="0.999991662921349">
The basic multilateral algorithm is described in
Kessler and Lehtonen (2006); here I give a sum-
mary of the relevant facts. For each of 15 languages,
we collected all of the words expressing concepts
in the Swadesh (1952) list of 200 concepts. How-
ever, words were discarded if they violated the key
assumptions discussed in the introduction. For ex-
ample, onomatopoeia and sound symbolism would
violate the assumption of arbitrariness: languages
could easily come up with similar words for the
same concept if they both resorted to natural asso-
ciations between sounds and their meanings. Gram-
matical words were rejected because they tend to
have certain phonetic properties in common across
languages, such as shortness; this also violates arbi-
trariness. Loanwords were discarded in order to fo-
cus on genetic relationships rather than other types
of historical connection.
In addition to rejecting some words outright, we
tagged others for their relative suitability for a histor-
ical analysis. The concepts themselves were scored
for how much confidence other researchers have
placed in their suitability for glottochronological
studies. Some of the contribution to this score was
quite subjective; other parts of it were derived from
studies of retention rates: how long words express-
ing the concept tend to survive before being replaced
by other words. The words were stripped down to
their root morpheme, and then tagged for how con-
cordant that root meaning is with the target concept;
for example, if a word for ‘dirty’ literally means ‘un-
clean’, the root ‘clean’ does not express the concept
‘dirty’ very well. None of the conditions indicated
by these suitability measures invalidates the use of
a word, but low retention rates and complex seman-
tic composition mean the word has a lower chance
of being truly old and consequently of being a very
good datum in a comparison of languages suspected
of being only distantly related. These suitability
scores were combined for each word in each lan-
guage. Then, in any given comparison between lan-
guages, the suitability scores for each concept were
aggregated across words, and the 100 concepts with
the best rankings were selected for actual compari-
son. This technique both ensures the availability of a
reasonably large amount of data and also attempts to
ensure that the words themselves will be reasonably
probative without biasing the test in either direction.
In any single multilateral test, it is assumed that
we have a single specific hypothesis: whether one
group of one or more languages is related to another
group of one or more languages. The approach taken
therefore is to determine for each concept how dif-
ferent the words in one group are to the words in
the other group. If there are more than one word
in each group, then all crosspairs are computed and
their average is taken. This approach applies both
to the situation where there are multiple languages
in a group and multiple words for a given language.
These averages are then summed across all 100 con-
cepts, giving a single distance measure: a score of
how different the two groups of languages are from
each other.
It is important to note, however, that this dis-
tance measure is not meaningful in itself. Sets of
languages could get relatively low distance mea-
sures just because their phonological inventories
and phonotactics are very similar to each other’s;
such typological similarity is not, however, strong
evidence for historical connectedness between lan-
guages. Rather, what is needed is a relative compar-
ison: how dissimilar would the words be across the
two sets of languages if they were not matched by
semantics? This is computed by randomly match-
ing concepts in one set of languages with concepts
in another set of languages and recomputing the
sum of the dissimilarity measures. Each such rear-
rangement may give a different total distance, which
may not be representative, so this procedure is done
100,000 times and the distance is averaged across
all those iterations, yielding a very close estimate of
the phonetic difference between words that are not
matched on semantics. From this one can compute
the proportion by which the semantically matched
distance is less than the semantically mismatched
distance. This proportion is the magnitude m of
the evidence in favour of the hypothesis that sets
of languages are related to each other. At the same
time that the magnitude is computed, one can also

compute the significance level of the hypothesis,
by counting what proportion of the 100,000 rear-
rangements has a total distance score that is at least
as small as that between the semantically matched
words. That number estimates how likely it is that
the attested amount of evidence would have oc-
curred by chance, given the phonology of the sets
of languages. This paper follows the usual con-
vention in the social sciences of considering signifi-
cance levels, p, below .05 as being reasonably com-
fortable.
While each individual test can tell the probabil-
ity that two sets of languages are related, specific
studies may seek to find out which of three or more
sets of languages are related. To investigate that, a
nearest-neighbour hierarchical clustering is used. In
each cycle of the procedure, comparisons are made
between all pairs of sets of languages to see which
pairs have significant evidence (p &lt; .05) of being
related. Of those, the pair with the highest magni-
tude m are combined to form a new, larger, set of
languages. The cycles repeat until all languages are
grouped into one large set, or no pair of sets have
sufficiently significant evidence of being related.

3 Phonetic Distance Metrics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921898550725">
Phonetic distance metrics can be evaluated on sev-
eral different principles. The ultimate goal is that
they should result in p values that are very low when
languages are related and high when they are not re-
lated. Unfortunately, that goal is only partly evalu-
able. There are no two languages known for sure
not to be related; otherwise there would be no mono-
geneticists. The best one can test for is m values that
correlate well with our incomplete knowledge of the
degree of relatedness between languages.
Beyond basic engineering goals of simplicity and
efficiency, therefore, a good algorithm should give
a relatively low distance score for words or lan-
guages known to be related. To the extent possible,
it should take minimal account of phonetic features
that change quickly over time, and weight more
heavily features that tend to be stable over time.
It is perhaps less obvious that a phonetic dis-
tance metric should be based on features that are
widespread, both across the languages of the world
and within individual languages. To take a clearly
absurd example, a bad metric would give a distance
of 0 if two words agree in whether or not they con-
tained a click, and 1 otherwise. For the vast major-
ity of languages, all word pairs would be assigned a
distance 0, because neither word has a click. Such
a metric would find no evidence that any pair of
clickless languages are related, because the distance
of the semantically matched pairs would be no less
than the distance of the mismatched pairs. Simi-
larly, even if a feature is found in both languages,
it should be neither too common nor too rare. For
example, many languages have a contrast between
lateral and central sounds, but lateral sounds tend
to be vastly less common than central sounds. A
metric that compares sounds based on central/lateral
distinctions may again end up finding little probative
evidence. This observation may seem commonplace
for statisticians, but is worth pointing out because
the tradition in historical linguistics has always been
to look for pieces of evidence that are individually
spectacular for their rarity, such as a pair of words
whose first five sounds are all identical. It is great
to report such evidence when it is found, but bad
to demand such evidence in advance, because typi-
cally any specific type of spectacular evidence will
not show up even for related languages. In a statis-
tical analysis it is much better to look for common
pieces of evidence to ensure that their distribution
in any particular study will be typical and therefore
reasonably conducive to a reliable quantitative anal-
ysis.
A much more subtle danger is that a poorly cho-
sen phonetic distance metric might be influenced by
parts of the phonology that are not as completely ar-
bitrary as one might like them to be. Because the ar-
bitrariness hypothesis is almost always observed to
be applicable in practice, and because it has attained
the status of dogma, linguists do not know all there
is to know about conditions in which the association
between sound and meaning may not be entirely ar-
bitrary and the ways in which that non-arbitrariness
may repeat across languages, spuriously indicating
that languages are related. However, one strong con-
tender for non-arbitrariness is word length. It ap-
pears to be true that words that are longer in one
language tend to be longer in another. If a pho-
netic distance metric is sensitive to word length, it
could indicate that semantically matched words are

more or less similar than mismatched words, just be-
cause their length is similar. This study attempts
to minimize that effect by discarding grammatical
words, which tend to be systematically shorter than
lexical words. It also reduces words to their root
morpheme, in part because crosslinguistic tenden-
cies favouring longer words are probably due largely
to a tendency to use more morphemes when building
lower-frequency concepts. Nevertheless, even these
steps are not proof against matching-length effects,
and so it would be better for phonetic distance met-
rics not to be sensitive to word length.

3.1 Candidate Metrics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99943335443038">
Seven different phonetic distance metrics were eval-
uated for this study.
C1-place. The phonetic distance metric used by
Kessler and Lehtonen (2006) was based on the ob-
servations that in language change, consonants tend
to be more stable than vowels, the front of the word
tends to be more stable than the end of the word,
and place of articulation tends to be more stable than
other features. Consequently it is based on the place
feature of the first consonants (C1) found in the com-
paranda; only if a comparandum has no consonant at
all is its first vowel used instead. Places of articula-
tion are assigned integer values from 0 (lips) to 10
(postvelar), and candidate phones are assigned a list
of these values, which allows for secondary and dou-
ble articulation. The phonetic distance between two
sounds is the smallest absolute difference between
the crosswise pairings of those place values. In ad-
dition, half a point is added if the two sounds are not
identical. For example, when comparing the Old En-
glish word for ‘child’, /tfild/, with the corresponding
Old High German word, /kind/, the algorithm would
extract the first consonants, /tf/ and /k/; assign the
postalveolar /tf/ a place value of 4 and the velar /k/
a value of 9; and report the difference plus an extra
0.5 for being non-identical: 5.5.
P1-Dolg. Baxter and Manaster Ramer (2000), in
a demonstration of bilateral comparison, used a
phonetic distance metric adapted fom Dolgopol-
sky (1986). Dolgopolsky grouped sounds into 10
classes, which were defined by a combination of
place and manner of articulation. Two sounds were
considered to have a distance of 0 between them if
they fell in the same class; otherwise the distance
was 1. Instead of using the first consonant in the
word, the first phoneme (P1) is used instead, but all
vowels are put in the same class. Dolgopolsky’s idea
was to group together sounds that tend to change
into each other over time; thus one class contains
both velar stops and postalveolar affricates, because
the sound change [k] —* [tf] is common. Thus in the
example of /tfild/ vs. /kind/, the reported distance
would be 0.
C1-Dolg and P1-place. These metrics were intro-
duced in order to factor apart the two main differ-
ences between C1-place and P1-Dolg. C1-Dolg uses
Dolgopolsky classes but operates on the first conso-
nant, if any, rather than on an initial vowel. P1-place
uses the place comparison metrics of C1-place, but
always operates on the first phoneme, even if it is a
vowel. So many morphemes begin with a consonant
that this is often a distinction without a difference,
as in the ‘child’ example. But note how in compar-
ing Old English /w:g/ with Latin /o:w/, both ‘egg’,
the P1 versions would compare /w:/ with /o:/, for a
distance of 3.5 by the P1-place metric (palatal vs.
velar vowels) and 0 by the P1-Dolg metric (all vow-
els are in the same class); whereas the C1 metrics
would compare /g/ with /w/, for a distance of 0.5 by
C1-place (both sounds have velar components) and
1 by C1-Dolg.
P1-voice. This metric is designed to be as sim-
ple as possible. Two words have a distance of 0 if
their first phones agree in voicing, 1 if they disagree.
Breathy voice was counted as voiced. The idea here
is that phonation contrast is reasonably universal,
and it is a relatively simple matter to partition all
known phones into two sets.
C*-DolgSeq. In the comparative method, the best
evidence for genetic relatedness is considered to
be the presence of several words that contain mul-
tiple sounds that all evince recurrent sound cor-
respondences. In particular, multiple consonant
matches between words are often sought as partic-
ularly probative evidence. This metric implements
this desideratum by lining up all the consonants (C*)
in the words sequentially (hence Seq). Each such
pair of aligned consonants contributes a distance of
1 to the cumulative distance between the words if the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996821">
10
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956357142857">
consonants are not in the same Dolgopolsky class.
If the one word has more consonants than the other
word, alignment begins at the beginning of the word,
and the extra consonants at the end are ignored. To
avoid making this metric sensitive to word length,
the total distance is divided by the number of conso-
nant pairs. Continuing the ‘child’ example, /t❙/ and
/k/ contribute 0 because they are in the same Dol-
gopolsky class; /l/ and /n/ contribute 1 because they
are in different classes; and /d/ and /d/ contribute 0;
the sum 1 is averaged across 3 comparisons to give
a score of 0.33.
C*-DolgCross. Although the C*-DolgSeq metric
attempts to exploit information from multiple con-
sonants in each pair of words, it fails to exploit all
possible information. The extra consonants at the
end of the longer word are ignored. Further, there is
the possibility that the sequential alignment would
fail under some fairly common situations. For ex-
ample, if in one language a consonant is deleted or
vocalized, the later consonants will not be aligned
correctly. To address this issue, this metric exam-
ines all crosswise pairs of consonants and reports
their average Dolgopolsky metric. In the example,
/t❙/ is compared to /k/ (0), /n/ (1), and /d/ (1); /l/ is
compared to /k/ (1), /n/ (1), and /d/ (1); and /d/ is
compared to /k/ (1), /n/ (1), and /d/ (0). Thus the
metric is 7/9, or 0.78.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999512">
Data from 15 languages were used. These languages
were selected to give a reasonably wide range of
variation in their relatedness to each other. Eleven
of the languages were Indo-European, and four were
Uralic. Within both of those families there are
subclades that are noticeably more closely related
to each other than to other languages in the same
family. The Indo-European set contains four Ger-
manic languages (Old English, Old High German,
Gothic and Old Norse) and two Balto-Slavic lan-
guages (Lithuanian and Old Church Slavonic); all
the other languages are traditionally considered as
belonging to separate branches of Indo-European:
Latin, Albanian, Greek, Latin, Old Irish, and San-
skrit. The Uralic set contains three languages that
subgroup in a clade called Finno-Ugric (Finnish,
Hungarian, and Mari), which is rather distinct from
the Samoyedic branch, which contains Nenets. Sev-
eral linguists believe that the Indo-European and
Uralic languages are related to each other (e.g.,
Bomhard, 1996; Greenberg, 2000; Kortlandt, 2002),
though this hypothesis is far from being universally
accepted. For each of the 15 languages, transla-
tion equivalents were found for each of the Swadesh
200 concepts, as described in Kessler and Lehtonen
(2006).
The multilateral comparison algorithm described
above was performed once with each of the above-
described phonetic distance metrics. Each of the
analyses comprised a complete hierarchical clus-
tering of all 15 languages. For each metric, the
main concern was whether a multilateral analysis
performed with it would group together languages
known to be related, however remotely. A second
question was what similarity magnitudes would be
reported for languages known to be related. In gen-
eral one would expect a good phonetic distance met-
ric to yield high magnitudes and low p values for
languages known to be related, and that, all things
being equal, magnitudes should increase the more
closely related the languages are.
A large amount of information is available about
each run of the program. The algorithm begins by
performing bilateral comparisons for each pair of
languages, and it might be somewhat interesting to
compare those 105 data points across each of the
seven metrics. Perhaps more interesting and decid-
edly more succinct is to focus on the numbers for
each of the major clades described above (Table 1).
Because almost all of the runs of the program cre-
ated clusters that contained exactly the languages in
each of the clades named in the column headers, it
was possible to show the m value reported by the
program when that cluster was formed: the degree
of similarity between the two subsclusters that were
joined to form the cluster in question. For exam-
ple, when the algorithm using the Ci-place metric
joined Old Norse up with a cluster containing Old
English, Old High German, and Gothic, it reported
an m value of .65 between those two groups. Be-
cause of the nature of the clustering algorithm, this
represents the weakest link within the clade: in gen-
eral, the similarity between languages in each of
those two subclades will be higher than this number.

rics. All of them constructed the relatively easy sub-
clades (Germanic, Balto-Slavic, and Finno-Ugric),
reporting very strong significance values. All of
them except P1-voice constructed Indo-European
and Uralic, which are both fairly difficult to identify;
in fact P1-voice nearly did so, except that it mis-
classed Nenets with the Indo-European languages.
All of them assigned very low similarity magnitudes
to a proposed Indo-Uralic grouping: that is, they
found very little similarity between Indo-European
and Uralic words for the same concept. Further-
more, the magnitudes for the various clades are all
ranked in the same order. As one would hope, the
subclades within each family are given much higher
m values than the families themselves.

(C1-place vs. C1-Dolg and P1-place vs. P1-Dolg),
no very consistent patterns emerge. But the Dolgo-
polsky metrics tend to reveal the Uralic family with
much higher significance levels than do the other
measures, and they are also the only metrics that
ever posit an Indo-Uralic clade at acceptable signif-
icance levels (C1-Dolg at p = .04; C*-DolgSeq at
p = .02). An optimistic explanation is that the Dol-
gopolsky classes are better at finding subtle evidence
of language relatedness, and that this may be due
to their being constructed eclectically. Sounds were
claimed to have been grouped into classes based on
the frequency with which they are known to develop
into each other in the course of language change
(Dolgopolsky, 1986:35), not based on any a priori
principle; place of articulation clearly is a consid-
eration, but there are many other factors involved.
For example, one group comprises the coronal ob-
struents, except that sibilant fricatives are in a sep-
arate group of their own, and sibilant affricates are
grouped with the velars. One might expect a system
based on empirical data to perform better than one
based on a monothetic property such as place of par-
ticulation. However, it must also be cautioned that
Dolgopolsky did not explain how he gathered the
statistics upon which his classes are based. Since
the classes were introduced in a paper designed to
show that Indo-European and Uralic, among other
families, are related to each other, it is possible that
the statistics were informed at least in part by pat-
terns he perceived between those language families.
There is therefore some small cause to be concerned
that Dolgopolsky classes may be, if only inadver-
tently, somewhat tuned to the Indo-Uralic data and
therefore not completely unbiased with respect to
the research question.
A more consistent trend in the table is that the
metrics that attempt to incorporate more informa-
tion about the comparanda return lower similarity
magnitudes. The C*-DolgSeq metric, which aligns
the consonants and reports the average distance
across all the pairs. gave substantially lower num-
bers than the metrics that analyze single phonemes.
This observation applies even more strongly to the
C*-DolgCross metric, which reported magnitudes a
third the size of other measures. The result is not
unexpected. It is common knowledge that initial
consonants tend to be more stable than other conso-

nants in the word; incorporating non-initial conso-
nants into the metric means that a higher proportion
of the data the metric looks at will be more dissimi-
lar. This being the case, it may seem surprising that
C*-DolgSeq and C*-DolgCross showed essentially
the same connections between languages as did the
other metrics, and at strong significance levels. Even
though the similarity levels are close to background
levels (those of semantically unmatched pairs), they
are still measurably above background levels; the p
values are only concerned with whether the matched
data is more similar than the unmatched data, not by
how much they are different.
Pi-voice was introduced to experiment with a
metric that takes the other approach: instead of in-
corporating more material into the measure, it incor-
porates less. Being based on a single binary pho-
netic feature, Pi-voice is arguably the most mini-
mal metric possible. Perhaps not unexpectedly, it
has the opposite effect of that of C*-DolgSeq and
C*-DolgCross: m measures are raised. At the same
time, this metric too appears to reveal the known re-
lations between languages. The several gaps in the
table are due to a single odd choice that the algo-
rithm made: it concluded that the Uralic language
Nenets was quite similar to the Germanic languages,
at least with respect to whether the first sound is
voiced in semantically matched words. Presumably
this connection was just a chance accident; indeed,
saying that one is working with significance levels
of .05 is another way of saying that one is willing to
tolerate such errors about 5% of the time.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993962264151">
The evaluation of the methodology across 15 lan-
guages did not provide overwhelming evidence
favouring one type of phonetic distance metric over
another. Perhaps, by a small margin, the strongest
results are obtained by comparing what Dolgopol-
sky classes the first consonants − or, equally well,
the first phonemes − of the words fall into, but noth-
ing seriously warns the researcher away from other
approaches.
Conceivably further experiments with other data
sets will reveal strengths and weaknesses of different
metrics more convincingly. Until such time, how-
ever, it may be most useful to choose phonetic dis-
tance metrics primarily on theoretical, if not philo-
sophical, criteria. Metrics that look at many parts of
the word have the advantage of not missing infor-
mation, even if it turns up in unusual places. It is
not unknown for a branch of a language family to do
something unusual like drop all initial consonants;
in such an event, all the single-phoneme metrics ex-
plored here would fail entirely. One does not really
wish to change one’s metric for different sets of lan-
guages, because if one has the freedom to fish for
different metrics until a test succeeds, one can alm-
sot certainly − and spuriously − prove that almost
all languages are related. So there is some advan-
tage to having a metric that covers all the bases. But
the similarity measures returned under such circum-
stances do tend to be small, and although such re-
duction in m did not seem to have any deleterious ef-
fect in the present experiment, it is not unreasonable
to worry that weak similarity measures may cause
problems in some data sets. Further, the more of a
word one is looking at, the more likely it is that one
will inadvertently encode length information into the
metric.
The main conclusion to be drawn from this study
is that the basic methodology is very hospitable to
a variety of phonetic distance metrics and performs
adequately and stably with any reasonable met-
ric. Unlike parametric methods, this randomization-
based methodology does not require the researcher
to develop new formulas to compute strength and
significance values for each new distance metric.
The simple expedient of randomly rearranging the
data a large number of times and recomputing the
distance metric for each rearrangement provides the
most literal and straightforward way of applying the
key insight of the arbitrariness hypothesis: the pho-
netic similarity of semantically matched words will
be no greater than that of semantically mismatched
ones, unless some historical contingency such as de-
scent from a common language is involved.

In addition, half a point is added if the two sounds are not identical. For example, when comparing the Old English word for ‘child’, /tfild/, with the corresponding Old High German word, /kind/, the algorithm would extract the first consonants, /tf/ and /k/; assign the postalveolar /tf/ a place value of 4 and the velar /k/ a value of 9; and report the difference plus an extra 0.5 for being non-identical: 5.5. P1-Dolg. Baxter and Manaster Ramer (2000), in a demonstration of bilateral comparison, used a phonetic distance metric adapted fom Dolgopolsky (1986). Dolgopolsky grouped sounds into 10 classes, which were defined by a combination of place and manner of articulation. Two sounds were considered to have a distance of 0 between them if they fell in the same class; otherwise the distance was 1. Instead of using the first consonant in the word, the first phoneme (P1) is used instead, but all vowels are put in the same class. Dolgopolsky’s idea was to group together sounds that tend to change into each other over time; thus one class contains both velar stops and postalveolar affricates, because the sound change [k] —* [tf] is common.

This method is more sophisticated than eyeballing similarities, not least because it recognizes the effect of phonetic apomorphies − sound changes − such as the change of /d/ to /t/ in Old High German. The standard methodology gives no concrete guidance as to how many recurrent sound correspondences constitute proof. However, there have been attempts to recast the comparative method in terms of modern statistical theory and experimental methodology, providing clearcut quantification of the magnitude and significance of the evidence that languages are related (see Kessler, 2001, for recent developments and a summary of earlier work). One drawback to recent statistical adaptations of the comparative method is that they have been limited to comparing two languages at a time. It has been claimed, however, most prominently by Greenberg (e.g., 1993), that when one wishes to test whether a large set of languages are related, conducting a series of bilateral tests loses power: there may be information contained in a pattern of relations across three or more languages that is not manifest in the bilateral partitioning of the set of languages.

However, many different phonetic comparison algoriths have been proposed for many purposes, including this task of looking for similarities between words (reviewed in Kessler, 2005); in particular, Baxter and Manaster Ramer (2000) and Oswalt (1998) developed algorithms expressly for investigating language relatedness, though only in bilateral tests.

For each of 15 languages, we collected all of the words expressing concepts in the Swadesh (1952) list of 200 concepts. However, words were discarded if they violated the key assumptions discussed in the introduction. For example, onomatopoeia and sound symbolism would violate the assumption of arbitrariness: languages could easily come up with similar words for the same concept if they both resorted to natural associations between sounds and their meanings. Grammatical words were rejected because they tend to have certain phonetic properties in c</context>
<context position="18275" citStr="Kessler and Lehtonen (2006)" startWordPosition="2954" endWordPosition="2957">matical words, which tend to be systematically shorter than lexical words. It also reduces words to their root morpheme, in part because crosslinguistic tendencies favouring longer words are probably due largely to a tendency to use more morphemes when building lower-frequency concepts. Nevertheless, even these steps are not proof against matching-length effects, and so it would be better for phonetic distance metrics not to be sensitive to word length. 3.1 Candidate Metrics Seven different phonetic distance metrics were evaluated for this study. C1-place. The phonetic distance metric used by Kessler and Lehtonen (2006) was based on the observations that in language change, consonants tend to be more stable than vowels, the front of the word tends to be more stable than the end of the word, and place of articulation tends to be more stable than other features. Consequently it is based on the place feature of the first consonants (C1) found in the comparanda; only if a comparandum has no consonant at all is its first vowel used instead. Places of articulation are assigned integer values from 0 (lips) to 10 (postvelar), and candidate phones are assigned a list of these values, which allows for secondary and do</context>

For each metric, the main concern was whether a multilateral analysis performed with it would group together languages known to be related, however remotely. A second question was what similarity magnitudes would be reported for languages known to be related. In general one would expect a good phonetic distance metric to yield high magnitudes and low p values for languages kno</context>

The Uralic set contains three languages that subgroup in a clade called Finno-Ugric (Finnish, Hungarian, and Mari), which is rather distinct from the Samoyedic branch, which contains Nenets. Several linguists believe that the Indo-European and Uralic languages are related to each other (e.g., Bomhard, 1996; Greenberg, 2000; Kortlandt, 2002), though this hypothesis is far from being universally accepted. For each of the 15 languages, translation equivalents were found for each of the Swadesh 200 concepts, as described in Kessler and Lehtonen (2006).

The core of the multilateral comparison methodology is the phonetic similary metric. To my knowledge, Greenberg never specified any particular metric. However, many different phonetic comparison algoriths have been proposed for many purposes, including this task of looking for similarities between words (reviewed in Kessler, 2005); in particular, Baxter and Manaster Ramer (2000) and Oswalt (1998) developed algorithms expressly for investigating language relatedness, though only in bilateral tests. In this paper I explore several different 7 phonetic comparison algorithms and evaluate how well they perform in Kessler and Lehtonen’s (2006) multilateral comparison task for Indo-European and Uralic. 2 Multilateral Comparison The basic multilateral algorithm is described in Kessler and Lehtonen (2006); here I give a summary of the relevant facts.

It has been claimed, however, most prominently by Greenberg (e.g., 1993), that when one wishes to test whether a large set of languages are related, conducting a series of bilateral tests loses power: there may be information contained in a pattern of relations across three or more languages that is not manifest in the bilateral partitioning of the set of languages.

However, words were discarded if they violated the key assumptions discussed in the introduction. For example, onomatopoeia and sound symbolism would violate the assumption of arbitrariness: languages could easily come up with similar words for the same concept if they both resorted to natural associations between sounds and their meanings. Grammatical words were rejected because they tend to have certain phonetic properties in common across languages, such as shortness; this also violates arbitrariness.
