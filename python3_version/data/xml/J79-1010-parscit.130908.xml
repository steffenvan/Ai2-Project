This report deals with work performed by the Contrastive
Oemantics Project in the Department of Linruistics of the Univer-
sity of California at Berkeley. The project was supported by
Air Force Contract No. F30602-72-C-0/1-06. Associated with the
project during its entire life, in addition to the author, were
Patricia M. Clancy, Leonard M. Yaltz, Christopher Murano, and
Hasmig Seropian. Also active during more than half of this period
were Masayosti Shibatani and Linda oobek. Associated during shorter
periods of time were Teresa M. Chen, Charles J. Fillmore, Robert E.
Gaskins, and Marie-Claude Jorlatd. Masayoshi Hirose served as a
consultant on Japanese during the final two months.
This same reoort, in slightly different form, was published
by Rome Air Development Center, Griffiss Air Force Base, Aew York,
as RADC-TR-74-2&apos;71 (October 19&apos;74).

I. Overview

<bodyText confidence="0.967845388888889">
Central to the view of trdnbiation that will be presented
here is the notion of verbalization, Verbilization is the applica-
tion of processes by which som holistic conceptual chunk,
recalled from memory, is converted into sentences and words--
into a phonetically or gra;)hically communicable ling uistic repre-
sentation.(ouch a notion assumes that the underlying content of
what is being communicated is not, or need .not be, in verbal form
to begin with. At the very least it may be a complex system of
discrete elements and relations, represen able perhaps as a network
of nodes and arcs. It may also involve an important nondiscrete
or analog component, representable only in some other terms. (For
excellent summaries of both sides of thi- particular issue see
Pylyshyn 1973 and Faivio 1974.) 4vhatever may turn out to be the
case here, it seems clear that some sorts of processes must be
applied in order to transform the original form of storage into a
verbal output: that the stored materi I must be verbalized.
In any particular instance of translation there are two in-
stances of verbalization. One I&apos;S the originil verbnlization per-

formed by the Grill-tor of the source language text. The other is
the verbalization produced in the tlrget language by the t2 inslator.
3esides being in different lnguages, these two verbalizations
are fundamentally different in one other respect. 2he source
language verbalization is, we might say, autonomous. It is freely
produced by the speaker or writer in any way he decides is a)pro-
priyte to the content Ind the occasion, provided he adhere Q to the
rules of his culture and the lanpu Re he is using. 2he tarcret

language verbalization, on the other hand, is parasitic on the
source language one. Not only must the translator adhere to the
rules of his own language, he must also produce a verbalization
that communicates, so flr as possible, the same underlying content
or knowledge that was communicated by the source language verbal-
ization. .he verbalization in the target language is thus subject
to this special kind of constraint., Its producer is not free to
&amp;quot;say what he wants,&amp;quot; but must insofar as poqsible say the same
thing as the producer of the source language text. we suggested
in an earlier report that there are two dimensions of high quality
translation, which we termed naturalness and fidelity. Naturalness
is achieved when the target language verbalization adheres to all
the constraints of that language; the output will then sound
&amp;quot;natural% Fidelity is achieved to the extent that the target
language verbalization communicates the same content as the source
language one.
Verbalization in general, as we see it, consists of a mixture
of two kinds of orocesses: those which necessitate creative de-
cisions on the Dart of the verbAlizer and those wlaich do not,

might sneak of creqtive processe- and 21EoTit_hplip_ processeb.
Orea-
tive processes are ultimately governed by the content which under-
lies the verbalization; the verb lizer has to decide how best to
verbalize that content. Normally a range of choices will be open
to him, and he must decide what will most effectively convey what
he has in mind. After he has made sch choices, there are often
automatic consequences which follow from them because of the

<bodyText confidence="0.999698962962963">
particular rules of the language (but which are themselves likely
to lead to the necessity of further creative choices). We can say,
then, with respect to the two verbalizations involved in a trans-
lation, that the producer of the source language, verbalization, has
applied both creative and algorithmic processes, whereas in the
target language verbalization only algorithmic processes are auton-
omously applied, the necessary creative choices being determined
by the choices that were made in the source language verbalization.
Thus the naturalness of the fanal translation depends largely on
adherence to the algorithmic processes of the target language,
while its fidelity depends on the extent to which the translation
has been able to incorporate creative cuoices that correspond to
those originally applied in the source language. In ail proba-
bility there are cases where exact correspondence in these choices
is not possible, and where a certain amount of autonomous crea-
tivity has to be introduced into the target verb lization -1,s well.
These are the cases where automatic translation becomes most
problematic. One useful goal of machine translati,)n research can
be to determine pracisely the nature and extent of such cases.
tie are led, then, to the general picture of translation which
is shown in Figure 1. The two vertical columns represent the two
verbalizations which are involved: .)n. the left the source languao
verbalization and on the right the target verbalization, 2he inpat
to a to a translation procedure, of course, is an already produced
verbal output or text in the source language. The first major
component of the translation procedure will have to be the re-
construction from that text of the verbalization processes by

The other major convonent of the translation procedure is the
translation component. It is equivalent to a v2rbnlization-in tne
targ2t language. The processes wqich make uo tin verbalization
are to the extent that they are algorithmic, those which exnrrtns
target language constraints and, to the extent ftat they r.-e crea-
ive, those which correspond to choices already made n the re-
constructed source language verbalization. The necossity of

a prior understanding of verbalization. Any other orderin,(- of
priorities would be putting the cart before the horse. Any detailed
investigation of the parsing comoonent would be futile if we did not

the processes that went into a p.artieular verbalization. The trdns-
lation component is a verbalilaion4 thQuRh one of a soecial sort,
and there again a detailed understanding of verbalization pro-
cesses is necessary. This report, then, will be most concerned with
the nature of verbalization. We will also devote considerale space
to the nature&apos; of that special sort of verbalization which is trans-
lation. We will have the least to sAy about parsing. Examples will
be cited from English and Japanese.
For bout the last nine months of the project we were concerned
with the development of an interactive computer program that would
implement the verbalization Drocesses we nypotqesized. Aithouirla
this prOgram remained primitive, the intention was that it would
gradually achieve increased sophistication in its ability to simu-
iate verbElization, translation, and parsing. As it presently
simulates the processes of verbalization, it begins with an item
that represents the initial holistic idea which the sneaker or
writer of a text wishes o communicate. It then asks the user,
seated at a teletype, to make the series of creative choices that
are hecessary in the production of the final text. At the same
time it attempts to apply on its own the algorithmic processes
which a-e called for. It knows when cretive choices are necessary,
but must ask the user what choices to make. Ideally it should be
able to apply the alcrorithmic processes without help. As it simu-
lates translation it should likewise be able to apply the algorithmic
processes of the targlt language automatically, and also to apply
certain creative processes

on its own by looking at the source language verbalizatiAn to see
wnat creative choices were made there. Whenever it is not able to
make a creative choice, the program asks the user to do so. e find
that this kind of machine-user inter ction nrovides a valuable
research technique. Taking as out ultimate goal the eventual elim-
inRtion of the user from the translation program aqtogether, we
start with a situation in which the user intervenes at many points.
As we learn more we can graaually give the machine more to do and
tne user less. This technique can be followed not only in verbal-
ization, but also in parsing Whetner the user will .eventually
disappeax from the Picture altogether is uncertain.
However that may be, the Eoal ai a proc;ram in which the conti.i-
bution of the user is significantly diminished in relation to that
of the machine seems workable. aort of the final goal of elimi-
nating tne user altogether, an intermediate goal identifiable as
&amp;quot;human-aided&amp;quot; machine translation can more easily be foreseen.
Here the machine will do the many things for which it is suited;
but a human brain will be introduced at those points where the
machine has reached its limits. This intermediate goal has, we
believe, significant practical as well as theoretical value.
Funding for thi.s project ceased in June 1974. The report
mutt be read, therefore, as a summary of work that was interrupted
Lia mid-course, andsas a partial blueprint for further work should
the necessary funding ever materialize. At this point, six months
after the termination of the project, the need for varibus modifi-
cations is already evident. It seems best, however, to document
consistently how things stood at the time of interruption, without

II. Subconceptualization
de assume that a speaxer or writer begins with a single,
unitary; holistic concentual chunk that he has recalled from
memory and has decided, for some reason to communicate. Thus he
may nave in mind some incident in which he was involved, something
of interest he was previously told about or read about, some ex-
periment he wishes to report on, or whatever. de label such a
chunk, as well as the smaller chunks into which it will be analyzed,
with the prefix CC (for &amp;quot;conceptual chunk&amp;quot;) followed by a four-
digit gumb_er. The first digit indicates the lang:uage n which
verbalization is to take place (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; for English and &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; for
Japanese), and the remaiming three digits constitute an arbitrary
indexâfor the particular chunk. Thus-Ce--1001 might be the name
given to some particular chunk of this sort that is about to be
verbalized in English.
We assume, futhermore, that while this chunk is from one
point of view a unit, from another point of view it has a more
or less rich content&apos;, aild that it is this content which the
speaker.wishes to convey to his audience. Sometimes, though not
in most cases, the initial chunk itself may have a linguistic
label. If it is a folktale, for example, it may have a name like
&amp;quot;Cihderella&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Three Bears&amp;quot;. But someone who has decided
to tell a story is not likely to say jdst &amp;quot;Cinderella&amp;quot; and let it
go at that. (One is reminded of the old story about a convention
of comedians at which people said things like &amp;quot;119&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;178&amp;quot; and
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.670981">

<bodyText confidence="0.995294666666667">
elicited laughter each tLme because everyone knew the jokes these
numbers stood for.) Normally it is necessary instead for the
speaker to get inside the content of this initial unit--to analyze
it into smaller chunks. This kind of process can be pictured as
shown in Figure 2, wherP the initial chunk 00-1001 has been, as we
say, subconceptualized into chunks CO-1002.and (..\;-1003. In a text
of any size each of these smaller chunks will be further broken
down into still smaller ones, and sp on, so that a hierarchical
structure of succ.essively smaller subconceptualizations emerges.
Subconceptualization belongs-to the class of verbalization
processes which are creative. Normally a chunk does not auto-
matically determine a particular subconceptual breakdown, but the
speaker must creatively choose how to subconceptualize each one.
It is useful to think of the content of each chunk--each circle in
Figure 2--as if it were a mountainous landscape, with the most
slalient aspects :tanding out in bold relief and the less salient
appearing as only minor hills. All other things being equal, the
more salient some aspect of the total content is, the more likely
the speaker is to express it when he subconceptualizes. He is not
likely to make exactly the same subconceptual breakdown each time
he communicates the same initial chunk, partly because he may
judge different things &apos;,;() be salient in different contexts and
partly because the landscape itself may change over time, the
relative salience of its different aspects being modified in
long-term memory. 1de assume that any particular subconceptuali-
zation necessarily leaves out part of the content of what is
being subconceptualized, as suggested by the area that lies within

the lqrger circle but outside the two smaller circles in Figure 2.
Subconceptualization, that is, is necessarily a selective process.
No one over says everything he could say about what he has in mind.
6ubconceptualization of pi particular chunk, say 03-1001, pro-
duces two or more hew chunks, say CC-1002 and C0-1003. These new
chunks, furthermore, are conceivd of as related to each other in
some way. For example) 33-1002 might be the &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot; for 30-1003.
Suppose the entire text consisted of the sentences, &amp;quot;I bolOit a
bike yesterday. I decided I need more exercise.&amp;quot; Let us say that
the first sentence is a verbalization of 00-1003 and the second
sentence of 00-1002. vie can say that 30-1002 is the reason for
CC-1003. write a subconceptualizati,n process of this kind in
the following way:
1) ,1C-1001 S&gt; CJ-REASON (CC-1002, 00-1003)
This statement says that the initial chunk, 00-1001, is sub-
conceptualized (S&gt;) into the chunks CC-1002 and 00-1003, and th:t
these two new chunks are related by the predicate labeled CJ-IL0N.
The prefix OJ stands for &amp;quot;conjunction&amp;quot; (derived from the Erammatical,
not the logical use of this term). 1Lny relTtion between -Jj&apos;s is
labeled with this prefix.
e use a different notation to repre::ent each of the various
stages in the verbalization process. c the outset, in this example
the initial chunk 30-1001 was all that was present. This initial
representation, before any verbalization processes had been applied,
was simply:
2) CC-1001
After the subconceptualization soeffified in 1) was applied, the
16
representation became:
30 CJ-REAOON
CC-1002
CC-1003
Subconceptualization processes are &apos;;hus rewrite rules, which replace
one stage in a verb:Ilization with a subsequent stage. The format
,de to represent such stages, as in 3), shoWg predicates with
their arguments written indented below them.
In simulating verbalization our program presently asks the user
to specify- all the creative choices, restricting its own contribution
to the applicatinn or algorithmic Processea determined by the grammar
of discourse, sentences, and words in tne lanpjuage involved. fne
program is labeled VAT (for nverblizei and translatoe), and we
can illustrate conversations between VA: and the user identifying
them as V and LT respectively. he prof7rambegins by asking:

can at least introduce the decision itself into the verbalization
model at this stae.
VAT will now apply an algorithmic or, as we say, syntactic
process triggered by the presence of CJ-REAWN in 3). The process
applied is of a type th0 is also not clearly understood, but we
may view what we do at prerent a first approximation. Tit the
moment VAT simply takes the twb 30s related Iv CJ-REAWN and orders
them so that the second will be expressed before the first. That
is, for exatple, if 30-1002 is eventwaly going to be verbalize; as
&amp;quot;1 decided I need more exercise&amp;quot; and 00-1003 as &amp;quot;I bought a hike
yesterday&amp;quot;, we want the two sentences to be expressed, with 03-1003
preueding 00-1002. Thus VAT will automatically change the repre-
sentation in 3) to tne following:
.8) OC-10,03
W-1002
This kind of representation, in which no predicate is shown anove
the two COs, indicates that they (or their eventual verbalizetins)
are to occur in the final text in the order.&amp;lown, with J0-1003 preâ
ceding OC-1002.
In Japanese the corresponaing syntactic process will tyoically
lead to the attachment of CJ-&amp;quot;KAAA&amp;quot; at the end of th6 second sen-
tence. 2hus if a representation like that in 3) were produced
in a Japanese verbalization VAT lowld automatically change it to:

The creatioi of these periods is a housekeepinP; task that need not

Given a representation like tht in 10), VAT will on to ask
about the subconcentualzatiim of the first Jo- in the ordering. The
general princir)le followed here is one of &amp;quot;depth. first&amp;quot;, in the sense
that etIrlier it,msin the text are corn letely IrrbJlized before the
verbalizatim of later items is berun. 211i procedure nrobably has
some psychological validity; thNt is, a speaker is liKely to tqink
of later parts of what he is roing to say only in terms of the most
general chunks, while he is elaborating the earlier Darts in detail.
Only after ne has finished the verbalization of these earlier
parts will he turn his attention&apos;to a full verbalization of the
later ones.

however. Not only does a speaker break down larger chunks into
smaller chunks--larger &amp;quot;concepts&amp;quot; into subconcepts; one chunk may
also remind him of another, so that the organization which results
may be in part concstenative. We have been viewing concatenation
in terms of excursions away from the main hierarchy, and hnve been
calling such excursi-ns digressions. In some discourse, however,
there is no necessary constraint that the main hierarchy be re-
turned to, and the result may be a rambling text in which digression
is added to digression. In a more tightly organized text digressions
are more likely to appear as parenthetical remarks: brief gidepaths
20
which quickly return to the main hierarchy. We use the term
parenthesis for this brief and transient kind of digression.
If subconceptualization 4can be represented in terms of a tree
diagram (which does not, however, provide a convenient means of
showing the relations between subconcepts, like CJ-REASON), then
digressions can be pictured as subtroes attached to the main tree
at one point or another, as surzestod in Figure 3.
One other important modification of the strictly hierarchical
model of.subconceptualization results from the common occurrence
of summarization. It is frequently the casc in verbalization tnat
an initial chunk will be subject to two sep.]rate hierarchies of
subconcepttnlization, one of which can be identified as a summary
of the other. It is cliaracteJristic of a summary th,t its subcon-
ceptualization Processes nevr,r proceed beyond some relatively large
chunksâchunks which package a relatively large content. r4e can
contrast a subconceptu.3lization hierarchy which is a summary with
a hierarchy which constitutes the body of the text and consists of
subconceptualization processes that produce a lar,wr number of chunks
of smaller size.
A sunmary is typically expressed at the beginning or end of a
text; that is, preceding or following the body. Various conventions
for summaries are associated with difr&apos;rJ ent genres of writing. For
example, a scientific article may begin with the cel-conscious kind
of summary that is called an abstract; a news report typically con-
tains an opening paragraph telling who, whati where, and when; a
fable is likely to end with a moral, and so on. Our program at
present sirinly asks, for the initial COI whether it has an initial
21
plain hierarchy
Figure 3
22
summnry (one exprestled at the berdnninK of the tQxt). If the
answer is yes it asks first for subconceptunliiAation of the sum-
mary, and moves on to ask About the body of the text only after the
summary has been completely verbalized. At the end of the text it
asks whether there is a final summary.
Creativity within a discourse is likely to be limited by the
genre to which the discourse belongs. It would aJpear that there
is a continuum ranging from mnximally stereotyped to maximally
creative discourse. Most stereotyped are those forms of discourse,
such as rituals, in which the speaker has very little choice as to
what he is going to say or how he is going to say it: With eueh
discourse the &amp;quot;grammar&amp;quot; of the genre provides many of the answers
to the questions VAT would otherwise have to ask the us,r,r. In other
words, VAT should be able to produce ritual texts with minimum
recourse to creative decisions. At the other extreme are forms of
discourse such ns descriptions of unique personal experiences which
have never been described before, where the speaker is relatively
free to make a &apos;reat variety of creative decisions.
We believe it would be of considerable interest to incorporate
into the verbalization process the constraints imposed by several
different genres, but we hnve not as yet done this. Js it now
stands OUT program does ask ,e4HAT 13 21r1 C;ENRE: as soon as it has
established that a verbalization is to be performed. Possible
answers that we would _like to implement in the future are, for
example, NEVS REPORT, PSY3HOLOGY A_TIOLE, YALE, and the like.

that are involved in the choice of a particular linguistic expres-
sion for a JJ. &apos;:..3ubconceptualization breaks down an initial chtlak
into smaller chunks. These smaller chunks, however, remain oncep-
tual in nature, and other operati)ns are necessary to convert them

ization involves the choice of &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; thNt will anoronriately

priate to linglistic expression, and particularly to linruistic
expressiOn that will convey neither too little or too&apos; much infor-

How are cohceptual chunks communicated: One way to approach
this Question is by looking it the spatial and temporal properties
of such chunks. A chunk is typically either an event (&amp;quot;He rubbed
his left eye&amp;quot;) or a situation (&amp;quot;The glue was next to the lamp&amp;quot;)

us too far afield at tnis point.)

degree, and not as an all-or-nothing decision. %f the degree to
which a particular CO is an instance of some 0 is very high-- if
the CO is highly codable--then the use of the word provided by the
UC will succeed quite well in conveying he content which the s eak-
er has in mind. If, on the other hand, the content of the JC is
not very well captured by assigning it to the UC, then the speaker
is likely to ilant to add one or more modifiers to mold the content
&apos;tore closely to the content Of the CC he has in mind AdVw?bs are
an obvious dwice by which such molding is accomplished. Thus, the
speriker might decide that the content of JO-1053 is better captured

and not simply &amp;quot;give&amp;quot;.
Suppose: 00-1053 is a conceptual chunk that will eventually
be varbalized with the sentence:
28) Mrs. Brown gave Tommy a cookie.
&apos;Afe he said that the word &amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; is available as a label for this
CC. Up to a point that is correct; there was a giving which took
place. But sentence 28) contains more than the word &amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot;. What
kind of conceptual information is conveyed by &amp;quot;MRS. BOWN&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;TOVEY&amp;quot;,
and &amp;quot;A COOKIE&amp;quot;: Each of these items evjdently communicates a conce;Dt
that is different in nature from a 30. This other kind of 2oncept
we label a PI (for &amp;quot;particular individual&amp;quot;). The chief difference
between a PI and a CC seems to have to ao with temporal particular-
ity. A CC is conceived of as odcupying a specific and usually
fairly limited period of time. The time period ocupied by, say,
311-
irs. Brown is much less snecific, and is not likely to be some-
thing we are very interested in when we utter a sentence like 28)
In other words, although aJd may have temporal particularity in
the sense of a lifespan or total time of existence, such a time
period tends to be of a different order of magnit:ude from that
occupied by a jC, and more often than not is of little relevance
when the is communicated. Furthermore, any one 1 may par-
ticipate in an indeterminate number of different OCs. (Mrs. Brown
has done many other things besides that which was reported in
28) )
11137 do PIs play a necessary role in the communication of a
CC? The answer may have something to do with the necessity for
providing anchor points in the addressee&apos;s mind. Because of its
lack of temporal particularity, the concept of a PI is a relatively
stlble concept, ana one which is liable 17(;) enter consciousn-!ss
again and again with respect to a wide variety of Cs. Thus, the
only way a sT)eaker can effectively install. the content of a
in the addrssee s mind is to tie it to one or more PIs already
known to the addressee. That i, the usual way of communicating
information is by brinNing one or &apos;tore iI nodes into the addressee&apos;s
consciousness, and by predicating something of these nodes.
Lan Puage usually involves takin7, one PI (the &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot;) as a starting
point and either predicating something of it alone, or tying ift to
other Is through a relational nredicate.

In deciding to cateFoxize a CC in a ertain way, say -s an
instance of UC-IrGIYC&amp;quot;.1 a speaker simultineously establisher-, a
framework of PIs ehich a-e separated out from the cofttent of the
&apos;41 1 and which will have to be linguistically represented in some
way. In the case of UC-&amp;quot;G.,.VE&amp;quot; these Is will function as arent,
beneficiary, and patient (the giver, the givee, and the given).
The fact that these- three Is Ire entailed by the choice of tfl-&amp;quot;I/.
is expressed as follow.s:
29) 00-A 0&gt; UJ-&amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot;
E&gt;
CC-A F&gt; VB-&amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; (PI-Btku2, PI-0f110,
The letters A, B, C, and D in this st tement are variables rang-
ing over particular four digit nunbers. For eXa=le, CC-A might
be 03-1053, PI-B might be PI-1687, etc. The sytbol E&gt; is to be

The statement in 29), then, slys that w&apos;aen ole has chosen
to categorize a particdlar CC as a instance of UJ-&apos;IV.&amp;quot;, trlis
decision entails that the CC r1ll be framed as, or expressed by,
the verb (V3) &amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; atcompanied b three IIs, functioning as
agent, beneficiary, and patient. ottements liko that in 29)
are stored in our znglish lexicon. Thi9 statement actually forms
only part of the lexical entry for JJ-&amp;quot;Gif., The com-)let entry
for this category contains a number of additional lines which
state -vrious other entailments, for exminle that giving involves
transfer of ownership. These other asects of lexical entries will
be discussed below.
To summarize, a CC of the a ,propriate size, arrived at through
subconueotualization, will be subject to categorization in terms
of some UC, the effect of which will be to 6roate, Iv way of the
lexicon, a verbal label for the 313 top,ether with a framework of
associ:xed nouns. The framing operation, in effect, will have
factored out those elements (.PIs) having no significant temporal
particularity, leaving a word (the VB) to which alone that teworal
particularity will be assigned.
It is probably a consequence of its being left with this
temporal role that the V3 is likely to end up carrying a temfioral
marker of some kind, such as a tense and or Rspect suffix. If,
for.example, the JO occuPieq a temporal locus that )recedes the
locus of the speech act, the VB is.likely to end up with a -oast
tense suffix attached. ?his part of lexialization we &apos;all

ization takes place only when the content of the JC is such th.:it
categorization is not appropriate. 2hus the first question asked

since special considerations have to be give to CCs that do not
have temporal particularity. If the answer to 51) is no, VAI.2
presently assumes by default that CJ-1053 has a temporal locus
preceding that of the speech act. This is certainly the mdst
probable state of affairs for most kinds of discourse. 4e would
like eventually to. elaborate other )ossibilities, which are likely
to depend on adverbial and other means of establishing temporal

The user says that the decision has been to catei-orize this J ns

A second considertion at this point is to establish which PI

addressee&apos;s attention to be focuse.d and concerning which something.
will be asserted. Again the easy way out is for VT to nsk the user:

roles like subject, indirect object, and direct object. (In

Again, the identity of the topic will often be deriv;ible from the.

tendency to remain constant from one clause to the_next, agents

empirical work will be necessary before all mich, factors have been
soPted out.
If the codability of JC-1053 had been somewhat lo_aer and the
modified categorization exemplified in 28) had been chosen, the
representation at this stage would include an adverlm (AV):

The lexicalization of C-ii-1053, then, has involvud coterorizn.â¢
tion, possibly modification, inflection, and framing. The next
step in verbalization is to lexicalize- the seve,-ral PIs which are
contained in a representation like 38) or 39). &apos;vie will see that
the lexicalization of a pr involves categorization, possibly modi-
fication, and inflection. Framing is for th.#3 most part restricted
to the lexicalization of a CC.

exicalization of a PI
A PI is the concept of a concrete object, be it animate ox
inanimate, or of an abstraction which has been reified and is being
treatect linguistically in ways analoirous to the treatment of
physical objects. The surface linguistic representati.on of a PI
may be a proper noun, a common noun, a pronDun, or nothing at all.
Furthermore, bj agreement processes certain features of the PI may
be incorporated into the verb with which it is associated. .:ach
language has its own idiosyncrasies in The treatment of Pis. Some,
like Japanese, are especially fond of deleting the PI altogether
whenever it is predicable from context. Some, of the polysynthetic
type, seem to go overboard in the extent to which tqey incorporate.
features of the noun within the verb. Some 7lake a Point addihg
inflectional features expressing &amp;quot;definiteness&amp;quot;, olurality, and the
like to the surface noun, while others seem to get along welll witb-
out such expression. For illustrative -)urpose we will coniine
ourselves in this section to the main outlines Of how a _PI is
lexicalized in English.
- Much depends on whether &apos;or not the PI in nuestion is &apos;given&amp;quot;â
whether it is a piece of knowledge that-th(-2 speaker believes his

for itself. If, for exampie, II-1234 was mentioned in the preceding
sentence the answer to q0) must be yes. If the preceding sentence
was &amp;quot;Mrs. Brown came over from next doort! and we are concerned with
the lexicalization of PI-1234 within the sentence &amp;quot;PI-1234 Eave
Tommy a cookie&amp;quot;, the givenaless of PI-1234 will result in its lex-
icalization as &amp;quot;SHE&amp;quot;. We can actually go a fair distance in es-
tablishing the givenness of a PI on this baoig alone, but the
question oi how else givenness is estabLisfted, including its
introduction from knowledge external to the linguistic text al-
together, calls for extensive further work.
Let us assume first that the answer to i-0) has been yes, in
which :ase English is likely to lexiaalize PI-1234 with a orOnoun.
This is not always the case; sometimes a PI that is given will not
be pronominalized. The principal criterion here sems to be whether
pronominalizatian will produere ambiguity, and ultimately VAT-will
need to deciae whether ambiguity will result. For now, however,
we proceed on the assumption that a PI which ln Riven- will auto-
matically be pronominalized.
The procedure we are currently using for pronominalization in
English asks first:
41) 10; IS PI-1234 THE ADDRLSSEE:
This question is asked first because the pronoun &amp;quot;YOU&amp;quot; does riot
distinguish nuMber, and if the answer to 41) is yes it will not be
necessary for VAT to do anythnig beyond lexicalizing P1-123q- as
NN-&amp;quot;YOU&amp;quot;&apos; (NN, of course, for &amp;quot;noun&amp;quot;). Ifi on the other &apos;wind, the
answer to 41) is no, then VAT must ask:

42) V: WHAT r6 THI3 CARDINAL:I-TY OP P1-12347
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.979860545454545">
We assume thmt a PI is from one point of view the concept of a
set of objects, and thnt une cardinality of the set is relevant
in establishing expressions of singularity and plurality, among
other things. Actually the distinction between one and more than
one as possible answers to 42) is all that is relevant at the
moment. More interesting questions do arise-in this area. For
example, with cardinalities up to about five there is likely to be
a need for distihguislaing each member of th,E&gt; set with a specific
PI number, where&apos;s with l&apos;irger cardinalities the set is likely to
be conceived of sim )1y as -containing &amp;quot;a number of&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;many&amp;quot; members.
If we assume first that the answ.:r to 42) is one, then VAT will

ask:
43) V: IS PI-l234 THE SPEAKER?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.643440333333333">
If the answer is yes, then PI-1234 is lexicalized as NN-&amp;quot;I&amp;quot;. If
no, then we are dealing with a third person referent and VAT must
determine its gender:
44) V: IS PI-1234 ANTHROPMORPHIC?
This classificatim includes human beings, but also named animals
such as pets. If the answ-3r to 4) is no, VAT will lexicalize
PI-1234 as NN-&amp;quot;IT&amp;quot;. Otherwise it must find the sex of this referent:
/1-5)Â° V: IS PI-123 MALE OR FEMME:
and lexicalize it as NIT-&amp;quot;HE&amp;quot; or NN-&amp;quot;BLE&amp;quot; accordingly.
If theenswer to 42) was a nmber greater than one, VAT must
decide between &amp;quot;WE&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;TilEY&amp;quot;, the pronouns which are explicitly
plural. Efsentially it must ask:

There are 6cain.a variety of Ways in Which VAT&apos; miht be able

2he identity of sneaker .1.nd addressee will h&apos;sve been established
by p ovidinr ruch discourse parameters at the very beLnning of the
discourse; at present we use â¢ne arbitrary convention that P1-1001
is the sDeakr and 21-1002 the addressee. In question 41) and 43)
1LIT is asIdnr whether 21-1234 is identical to P1-1002 or 21-1001.
But, de endin on the conLext, tlis identity may already nave been

made axbl:cit through a numeral or in some her way. knd the
gender of thi referent might have been established through the
previous use of a sex-s-e-;Ific proper name, or through some other
fact that has already been supplied.
Let us row turn to the possibility that 11-1234 is not given--
that the answ-!r to Question 40) waF; no. In that c9se, lexicalization

in section &apos;VII below.
VI. The Lexicor
In all, its o-nerations Via must at ,m&apos;4ny points nake access to
a store of more or less permanent lexical knowledge which we have
formalized in terms of entailments of critegories. The strytements
in the lexicon snecify what we know about a particular JG or PI as
a result of its being identified as an instance o a certain cate-
gory. Or, to look at it from the ormosite point of view, these
statements say what properties a particularÂ°CC or II must have in
order to be catefiorized in a ceru in way. From the rirst point of
view we can say that once we know that a-particular CC has been
categorized as an instance of UC-&amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot;, for example, the lexicon
tells us a number of other thins that we must know about this
CC. From the second point of view we can say that the lexical
entry for UC-&amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; tells us what we must know about a 3J in order
to assign it to this category. 1hose two wiys of viawinF lexical
entries &apos;are not in cont-adiction, but are different sides of the
same coin.
From aosyclIological stanlpoint the lexicon approximates a
desgription of everything that is involved ina person&apos; s interpretation
of the world, at least so far as his interDretive grid is depen-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.775754">

dent on verbal cnter,ories. We are unable, of nourne, to focus
on indlxidual differences, but must attemot to deal with a core that
is common to the speakrIrs of a. particular lanuace. The leYicon is
the heart of our pro,rrnm, whether we are engar;ed in verbalization,
translation, or parsing, and everythinf7 else denends on the success
with which the lexicon has been elaborated. A snrate lexicon lias
to be develooed for eachmlanguage with 4hich the program tries to
de.11. in a full-f1edF7nd implementaton certninly a very 10.47;h pro-
portion of the total develo37.ient1 effort will,qave to be devoted
to lexiCal questions.
As a siN,)le illustration of the kind of information a,lexical
entry might contain, as well as of the formalism we have &apos;neen using
to represent such informati-)h, let us consider at least Dart of
what it means for a particular J,-; to be &apos;:,tegorized as an instance
of 113-&amp;quot;LIFT&amp;quot; +;:e will watt to say thPt when X lifts Y, this entails
that X does somethinr, which causes a chane of stlite from Y beinr
in one location to Y being in another location, and furthel_liore
that the new locatinn is 9bove the old location. The lexic1 entry
for 11:;-&amp;quot;LIPT&amp;quot;, insof-r s it capLhres this, much informatvm, is
written as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.982685222222222">
51) CC-A 0&gt; U0-&amp;quot;LIFT&amp;quot;

L,ives the case frame, saying that there will be a clause containing
tne verb &amp;quot;LIFT&amp;quot; ac&apos;:ompanied by an ar,erit (PI-B) and a patient (PI-0).
The second line under&apos;12&gt; says that it is alternatiVely possible to
subconceptalize CC-A in n certain way, wnich amounts to a nara-
phr.lse. That is, although the speakr has.cioL-n not to subcon-
ceptualize JC-A further (breStriably because the choice of U0 &amp;quot;LIFT&amp;quot;
has been judged to provide the right packaing for C0-1,.), if he had
decided to subconcOtualize farther he could have done it in the
manner specified in this line, where two new JCs, %3J-D and
are joined by Cj-CAUL)E._ In othee words JJ-D is conceived of as
causing CC-E. 2he third line under E&gt; sys something about the
content of CC-D, namely that it involves -an act by PI-B. (It may
be noted that the absence of quotes around k0T in VB-ACT indicates
that this is not a conceptual unit that will lead to a direct sur-
face structure represent3tien, as will VB-&amp;quot;LIF2&amp;quot;.) Drie fourth line
under E&gt; says that 00-2,, which is caused by this act, can be sub-
conceptualized into. twooconjoined elarients. The first of these is
a 3HANCIE from JC-F to T0-G, and he seond is J-1,1 2he fifth and
sixth lines inder E&gt; specify the nature of the prior and subsequent
states, CC-F and JC-G. Both involve 2I-J beinE at some location,
first PL-I and then PL-J (PL standing for &amp;quot;particular location&amp;quot;).
The last line elucidates cc-a stating that the new location (PL-J)
is above the old location (iIL I). Thus 51) has captured formally
the several bits of knowledge abut CC-A that were summarized dis-
cursively at the beginning of this paragraph.
Let us now turn to a more comnlicated example. This example
came up initially as a result of the observation that the Japanese
verb kasu can be translated into English as either rent (out) or
lend. In other words this verb is nonspecific as to whether the
ap;ent does or does not recive money for the goods or services he
provides. We were interested in how a translation from Je,nanese
int D English would decide whether to use rent or lend where the
Japanese had used kasu. This problem led us to consider lexicul
entries for several verbs involving transfers and transactions, and
we arrived at a System of cross-referencing and embedding within
laxicn1 entries that captures the content of abstract notions
(such as transfer and transaction) at the same time that it links
entries one tc another in a way that is renerally useful.
vie may begin by defining a transfer. we &apos;assume a category UC-
TJN$Fii which, since at does riot cont%in nuotation marks, is
understood to be abstract nd not Immediately u(invertible into a
surface structu-e verb. The lexical entry roads as follows.:

<abstract confidence="0.983775269886363">here is the notion of verbalization, Verbilization is the application of processes by which som holistic conceptual chunk, from memory, is converted and words-into a phonetically or gra;)hically communicable ling uistic representation.(ouch a notion assumes that the underlying content of what is being communicated is not, or need .not be, in verbal form to begin with. At the very least it may be a complex system of discrete elements and relations, represen able perhaps as a network nodes and arcs. It involve an important nondiscrete or analog component, representable only in some other terms. (For excellent summaries of both sides of thiparticular issue see and Faivio 1974.) 4vhatever may turn out to be the case here, it seems clear that some sorts of processes must be applied in order to transform the original form of storage into a verbal output: that the stored materi I must be verbalized. In any particular instance of translation there are two inof verbalization. originil perby the of the source language text. The other is produced in the tlrget by the 3esides being in different lnguages, these two verbalizations are fundamentally different in one other respect. 2he source verbalization is, we might say, autonomous. It by or writer in any way he decides is a)proto the content Ind the occasion, provided he adhere Q to of his culture the lanpu he is using. tarcret 6 language verbalization, on the other hand, is parasitic on the source language one. Not only must the translator adhere to the rules of his own language, he must also produce a verbalization that communicates, so flr as possible, the same underlying content or knowledge that was communicated by the source language verbalization. .he verbalization in the target language is thus subject to this special kind of constraint., Its producer is not free to &amp;quot;say what he wants,&amp;quot; but must insofar as poqsible say the same thing as the producer of the source language text. we suggested in an earlier report that there are two dimensions of high quality which we termed naturalnessand fidelity.Naturalness is achieved when the target language verbalization adheres to all the constraints of that language; the output will then sound &amp;quot;natural% Fidelity is achieved to the extent that the target language verbalization communicates the same content as the source language one. Verbalization in general, as we see it, consists of a mixture of two kinds of orocesses: those which necessitate creative decisions on the Dart of the verbAlizer and those wlaich do not, Deli:1g governed by the constraints imr)osed by the 11nruage. sneak of creqtive processeand 21EoTit_hplip_processeb. Oreative processes are ultimately governed by the content which underlies the verbalization; the verb lizer has to decide how best to verbalize that content. Normally a range of choices will be open to him, and he must decide what will most effectively convey what he has in mind. After he has made sch choices, there are often automatic consequences which follow from them because of the 7 particular rules of the language (but which are themselves likely to lead to the necessity of further creative choices). We can say, then, with respect to the two verbalizations involved in a translation, that the producer of the source language, verbalization, has applied both creative and algorithmic processes, whereas in the target language verbalization only algorithmic processes are autonapplied, the creative choices being determined the choices were made in the source language verbalization. the of the fanal translation largely on adherence to the algorithmic processes of the target language, its fidelity depends on extent to which the translation been to incorporate creative cuoices correspond to originally applied in the In ail probaare cases where exact correspondence in these choices not and where a certain amount autonomous creahas to be introduced into the target verb are the cases where automatic most One goal of machine research can nature and extent of such cases. are to the general picture of which is shown in Figure 1.

The trdnscomponent is a thQuRh one of a soecial sort, there again a detailed understanding of verbalization prois necessary. This report, then, will be most concerned the nature of verbalization. We will also devote considerale space to the nature&apos; of that special sort of verbalization which is translation. We will have the least to sAy about parsing. Examples will be cited from English and Japanese. For bout the last nine months of the project we were concerned with the development of an interactive computer program that would verbalization Drocesses we Aithouirla this prOgram remained primitive, the intention was that it would gradually achieve increased sophistication in its ability to simuiate verbElization, translation, and parsing. As it presently simulates the processes of verbalization, it begins with an item represents the initial holistic idea which sneaker writer of a text wishes o communicate. It then asks the user, seated at a teletype, to make the series of creative choices that the production of the final text. At time it attempts to apply on its own the algorithmic processes a-e called for. knows cretive choices are necessary, but must ask the user what choices to make. Ideally it should be able to apply the alcrorithmic processes without help. As it simulates translation it should likewise be able to apply the algorithmic processes of the targlt language automatically, and also to apply certain creative processes 11 on its own by looking at the source language verbalizatiAn to see wnat creative choices were made there. Whenever it is not able to make a creative choice, the program asks the user to do so. e that this kind of machine-user inter ction nrovides a valuable technique. Taking as out ultimate goal the eventual eliminRtion of the user from the translation program aqtogether, we start with a situation in which the user intervenes at many points. As we learn more we can graaually give the machine more to do and tne user less. This technique can be followed not only in verbalization, but also in parsing Whetner the user will .eventually disappeax from the Picture altogether is uncertain. However that may be, the Eoal ai a proc;ram in which the conti.ibution of the user is significantly diminished in relation to that of the machine seems workable. aort of the final goal of elimitne user altogether, anintermediate goal identifiable as &amp;quot;human-aided&amp;quot; machine translation can more easily be foreseen. Here the machine will do the many things for which it is suited; but a human brain will be introduced at those points where the machine has reached its limits. This intermediate goal has, we believe, significant practical as well as theoretical value. Funding for thi.s project ceased in June 1974. The report mutt be read, therefore, as a summary of work that was interrupted Lia mid-course, andsas a partial blueprint for further work should the necessary funding ever materialize. At this point, six months after the termination of the project, the need for varibus modifications is already evident. It seems best, however, to document how things stood at the time interruption, without 12 untested material. that a speaxer or writer begins with a single, unitary; holistic concentual chunk that he has recalled from memory and has decided, for some reason to communicate. Thus he may nave in mind some incident in which he was involved, something of interest he was previously told about or read about, some experiment he wishes to report on, or whatever. de label such a as well as smaller into which it will be analyzed, with the prefix CC (for &amp;quot;conceptual chunk&amp;quot;) followed by a fourdigit gumb_er. The first digit indicates the lang:uage n which verbalization is to take place (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; for English and &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; for and the remaiming three digits an arbitrary the particular chunk. might be the name given to some particular chunk of this sort that is about to be verbalized in English. We assume, futhermore, that while this chunk is from one of view a unit, from another of view it has a less rich content&apos;, aild that it is content which the convey his audience. Sometimes, though not most cases, the initial chunk may have a If it is a folktale, for example, it have a name like Three Bears&amp;quot;. But someone who has decided tell a story is not likely to &amp;quot;Cinderella&amp;quot; and let it at that. (One is of the old about a comedians at which said like &amp;quot;178&amp;quot; and elicited laughter each tLme because everyone knew the jokes these numbers stood for.) Normally it is necessary instead for the speaker to get inside the content of this initial unit--to analyze it into smaller chunks. This kind of process can be pictured as shown in Figure 2, wherP the initial chunk 00-1001 has been, as we subconceptualizedinto chunks CO-1002.and (..\;-1003. In a text of any size each of these smaller chunks will be further broken into still smaller ones, and sp on, so that structure of succ.essively smaller subconceptualizations emerges. Subconceptualization belongs-to the class of verbalization processes which are creative. Normally a chunk does not automatically determine a particular subconceptual breakdown, but the speaker must creatively choose how to subconceptualize each one. It is useful to think of the content of each chunk--each circle in Figure 2--as if it were a mountainous landscape, with the most slalient aspects :tanding out in bold relief and the less salient appearing as only minor hills. All other things being equal, the more salient some aspect of the total content is, the more likely the speaker is to express it when he subconceptualizes. He is not likely to make exactly the same subconceptual breakdown each time communicates the same initial chunk, partly because he judge different things &apos;,;() be salient in different contexts and because landscape itself may change over time, the relative salience of its different aspects being modified in long-term memory. 1de assume that any particular subconceptualization necessarily leaves out part of the content of what is being subconceptualized, as suggested by the area that lies within 14 x-looa, Figure 2 15 lqrger circle but outside the two smaller circles in 2. Subconceptualization, that is, is necessarily a selective process. No one over says everything he could say about what he has in mind. of particular chunk, say 03-1001, produces two or more hew chunks, say CC-1002 and C0-1003. These new chunks, furthermore, are conceivd of as related to each other in way. For 33-1002 might be the &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot; for 30-1003. Suppose the entire text consisted of the sentences, &amp;quot;I bolOit a bike yesterday. I decided I need more exercise.&amp;quot; Let us say that the first sentence is a verbalization of 00-1003 and the second sentence of 00-1002. vie can say that 30-1002 is the reason for CC-1003. write a subconceptualizati,n process of this kind the following way: 1) ,1C-1001 S&gt; CJ-REASON (CC-1002, 00-1003) This statement says that the initial chunk, 00-1001, is subconceptualized (S&gt;) into the chunks CC-1002 and 00-1003, and th:t these two new chunks are related by the predicate labeled CJ-IL0N. The prefix OJ stands for &amp;quot;conjunction&amp;quot; (derived from the Erammatical, the use this term). 1Lny relTtion between -Jj&apos;s is with this e use a different notation to repre::ent each of the various in the process. c the outset, in this chunk 30-1001 was all that was present. This initial representation, before any verbalization processes had been applied, was simply: 2) CC-1001 After the subconceptualization soeffified in 1) was applied, the 16 representation became: 30 CJ-REAOON CC-1002 CC-1003 Subconceptualization processes are &apos;;hus rewrite rules, which replace one stage in a verb:Ilization with a subsequent stage. The format to represent such stages, as in predicates with their arguments written indented below them. In simulating verbalization our program presently asks the user all the creative choices, restricting its own the applicatinn Processea determined by the grammar discourse, sentences, and words in tne involved. fne program is labeled VAT (for nverblizei and translatoe), and we illustrate conversations between the user identifying them as V and LT respectively. he prof7rambegins by asking: V: fil4T VAT TA,r: to which one possible answer is: V203.:11= Skipping several steps to illustrnt ,Anly the rotr;h outlines of we are interaP,teri just now in V: HO Li which answer is: (&amp;quot;-1002, At this point Vilf will com-truct the representation shown in 3). givinf; an answer like thnt in 7) the user of tHL,1,s proram assumed to be El_king explicit a decizion wqich a real s eraker would make Lmcone3ciQusly -In the brlsis of a variety of complex criteria. :le do not pretend to understand how such a de,:is:on is reached; &apos;Iut 1 can at least introduce the decision itself into the verbalization model at this stae.

The process applied is of a type th0 is also not clearly understood, but we may view what we do at prerent a first approximation. Tit VAT simply takes the twb 30s related and orders them so that the second will be expressed before the first. That is, for exatple, if 30-1002 is eventwaly going to be verbalize; as &amp;quot;1 decided I need more exercise&amp;quot; and 00-1003 as &amp;quot;I bought a hike we want two to be expressed, with 03-1003 preueding 00-1002.

Not only does a speaker break down larger chunks into chunks--larger &amp;quot;concepts&amp;quot; into one chunk may also remind him of another, so that the organization which results may be in part concstenative. We have been viewing concatenation in terms of excursions away from the main hierarchy, and hnve been such excursi-ns digressions.In some discourse, however, is no necessary constraint that main be returned to, and the result may be a rambling text in which digression added to digression. In more organized more likely appear as parenthetical remarks: brief gidepaths 20 which quickly return to the main hierarchy. We use the term parenthesisfor this brief and transient kind of digression. If subconceptualization 4can be represented in terms of a tree diagram (which does not, however, provide a convenient means of showing the relations between subconcepts, like CJ-REASON), then digressions can be pictured as subtroes attached to the main tree at one point or another, as surzestod in Figure 3. One other important modification of the strictly hierarchical model of.subconceptualization results from the common occurrence summarization.It is frequently the casc in verbalization tnat an initial chunk will be subject to two sep.]rate hierarchies of one of which can be identified as a It is cliaracteJristic of summary th,t its subcon- Processes proceed beyond some relatively large which package relatively large content. r4e a is a summary with hierarchy which constitutes the bodyof the text and consists of subconceptualization processes that produce a lar,wr number of chunks of smaller size. sunmary is typically at the or end of a that is, preceding or following the body. conventions summaries are with ent genres of writing. a article may begin the kind of summary that is called an abstract; a news report typically conan paragraph telling who, where, and when; a is likely to end with a moral, and on.

If the is yes it asks first for subconceptunliiAation of the mary, and moves on to ask About the body of the text only after the has been completely verbalized. end of the text it there is a final summary. Creativity within a discourse is likely to be limited by the genre to which the discourse belongs. It would aJpear that there is a continuum ranging from mnximally stereotyped to maximally creative discourse. Most stereotyped are those forms of discourse, such as rituals, in which the speaker has very little choice as to what he is going to say or how he is going to say it: With eueh discourse the &amp;quot;grammar&amp;quot; of the genre provides many of the answers the questions VAT would otherwise have to ask the In other VAT should be able to produce ritual texts with minimum to creative decisions. other extreme are forms of discourse such ns descriptions of unique personal experiences which have never been described before, where the speaker is relatively free to make a &apos;reat variety of creative decisions. We believe it would be of considerable interest to incorporate into the verbalization process the constraints imposed by several different genres, but we hnve not as yet done this. Js it now does ask 13 C;ENRE: as soon as it has established that a verbalization is to be performed. Possible answers that we would _like to implement in the future are, for REPORT, PSY3HOLOGY A_TIOLE, YALE, and like. 23 of these procedures to a real text can be based on the following United Press report taken, slightly c(ndensed, from the Lan Francisco Chronicle of May 16, 19&apos;74: 13) 1.

Its first questions will deal with tine subconceptualization of the summary (expressed in the text in 17) V: HOW LD CO-1001 SUBC.:NCEPTUiLLIZED IN TIE aTillvtiutY? YIELD JC-1003) 25 user has answered that ;he first breakdown of the summary into two subconcepts&amp;quot;, CC-1002 (to be expressed as &amp;quot;Aft using a new 6ccidentally clued his eye shut a model irplane&amp;quot;) and CC-1003 (to be expressed as doctor had to reopen the eye surgically&amp;quot;). Furthermore the relation between these two JCs has been identified as one labeled YIELD, in the first JC &amp;quot;leads to &amp;quot; or in&amp;quot; second. YIELD diCfers from another, similar relation which is labeld CAUSE in that the event conceptualized by the second CO is not a necessary consequence of the first. .It is, however, something that presumably would not have happened if the event conceptualized by the first JO had not taxen place. (Evidently YI.2111) can be equated with IKITIA2E as this term is used by Rumelhart 1974, the relationship between an external event and the willful reaction of an anthropomorbhized to that 1974 Uses INITIATE differently.) As result of the user&apos;s answ?r in 17) VAT first creates the sentation: 18) CJ-YIELD CO-1002 CC-1003 CJ-&amp;quot;.&amp;quot; and immediately apr.lies syntactic processes which thanges it to: 19) CC-1002 CJ-&amp;quot;, AND&amp;quot; CO-1003 CJ-&amp;quot;.&amp;quot; That is, the two CCs are to be expressed with the &amp;quot;yielder&amp;quot; prethe &amp;quot;yielded&amp;quot;, and they are to be with comma followed by the word &amp;quot;AJD&amp;quot;. This is not the only way YIELD tan be realized, but for the sake of the example we may re it as such. VAT will now proceed to ask aJout the subcona6 ceptualiZation of the earliest CO in 19): 20) V: HOW IS 00-1002 SUBUONCN,PTUALIZED IN THE SUMMARY? FRAME 0C-1005) The user has answered that 00-1002 is broken down into two CCs, C0-1004 (&amp;quot;building a model airplane&amp;quot;) and 00-1005 (&amp;quot;An 11-yearboy using a &amp;quot;super-glue&amp;quot; accidently glued his eye shut&amp;quot;). They are related by FRAMES, a temporal relation in Which fae first occupies period larger than and including the time period of the second. In othr words the time period ofC-1004 includes that of 00-1005. VAT creates, sequentially, th following two representations:</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.950980842105263">Although there may be several possibilities for the expression FRAME, VLT has that two factors are involved: an oraering of the two OCs so that the &amp;quot;framer&amp;quot; precedes the &amp;quot;framed&amp;quot;, a prefixing of the word the first (In this the ordering Of two OCs will be reversed in a subopertion.) If FRAME may be in other ways, assume (gratuitously, for the moment) that subtle onceptual differences are involved; that there is not, in tither words, free Variation among possible syntactic algorithms. This remains for 27 article of faith. We would expect VAT to ask next shoat the subconceptualization but by a means not yet discussed VAT will discover that ;his is a terminal CC (one not further suoconceptualized). If were followed by &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;, VAT would proceed to isk questions directed at the complete verbalization of this CC. since C0-10u4 is not followed by one of boundaries, attention is netfocused on 00-1005: V: HOW IS IN THE OUMMAJin</abstract>

These smaller chunks, however, onceptual in nature, and other operati)ns are necessary to convert them into surface linguistic reprosentltions. Roughly speakinE, 141xica1involves the choice of &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; anoronriately communicate the content of 30,s. Lexicalization of a 30 takes places at the point where the decides that he hrs subconceptualized far enoligh,. The aim of subconcetualization is to )roduce chunks of a size apor0priate to linglistic expression, and particularly to linruistic expressiOn that will convey neither too little or too&apos; much information to thE addressee. Too little informntion is, for example, by whe.re 3ubeonceptualizati)n has proceeded only to a point whe e lexicalization w1 give the a drensee a idea&amp;quot; content of the whole. At the Â°trier end of the scale, we are all filmilier with erpoitions in which too luch is conveyed, where we rlre hp.n we want to know.

Consider, for example, the amoint of content that is in an English senvenc like &amp;quot;He hit into a doubie 31 If our lanp:uage did not provide this particualr expreSsion, we have to this chunk considerably further and come up with chunks that would have to be expressed im some such way as &amp;quot;He hit the ball to the shortstop, who threw it to the second baseman before the runner previously on Cirst base could reach second. 2he second baaeman then threw the b111 to the first baseman before the batter couid reach first., Thus his hit caused two outs to be made.&amp;quot; l&apos;resumably a language makes aVailable packaging var ous leves of according to predominant needs within rmlture of its soeakers. are cohceptual chunks One way to approach Question is by looking it spatial and temporal properties such chunks. A is typically either an event (&amp;quot;He rubbed left eye&amp;quot;) or (&amp;quot;The glue was to the lamp&amp;quot;) events and aituations have a particular spice and time (the difference being that an event involves some spatial throuqh time, situation does not). then&apos;, can be rer7nrded as assignable to particular coordinates in both a suatial and a temporal continuum. (de omit consider tion here of generic chunks, expressed-in &apos;sentences like &amp;quot;Dos chase cats&apos; or &amp;quot;The house had two chimneys&amp;quot;, where -particilarity is absent. Genericness calls or extended discussion that would take us too far afield at tnis point.) we of the chunks a wants to find linguistic expression for are events or situDtions, -rnd thus have spatinl and temporal particularity, it is that fails to provide direct labels for them. in 32 the course or nubconceptualizatiQn, arrive at something like CO-1011 remember that the name for this chunk is &amp;quot;BLUR&amp;quot;, comluni it by th&apos;it âord. Particu]Ar events situatiohs fire numerous, and our experience of them too idiosyncratic have its own name. 2he way solved is thrOvgh interpretltion)of many lifferent as inst&apos;inces of the same category.Thus the tirrie last December when I gave my mothr a oresent, the time when the mail&apos;aarl a registered letter this morning, the time yesterday when the teachr gave my a note to take home, etc. etc. 9re categorizable an &apos;givi,ng&amp;quot;. the category itself UC-&amp;quot;GIV.]&amp;quot; (T.3 -Standing for &amp;quot;universal category&amp;quot;) and snezify the choice of Oils category by the s enker with the notation: C&gt; T.D-&amp;quot;GIVIE&amp;quot; a statement is to be red &amp;quot;JO-1053 is cfcteorized instance of the cate7Ory 1J-&amp;quot;GIVE&apos;ttt. It should be noted that the English word &amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; is not tho, name of this category; rather particular .,;C is so c-Jaforizd can be communicated with the word &amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot;. In other words, the decision described in 27) us to use&apos; &amp;quot;6-&amp;quot;i&amp;quot; as a name for way in which a speaker decides a particular can categorized as an instance of some of c)urse a fundamintal on. one thing that seems clear is tiat some Os are more easily categorized than others; ease of catei7orizahas been called &amp;quot;codability&amp;quot; (Brown and Lenneberg a closer approximation to hu-lan nentn1 processes, therefore, a statement like 27) ourfrIt to be qualified as valid to a certain 33 degree, and not as an all-or-nothing decision. %f the degree to which a particular CO is an instance of some 0 is very high-if the CO is highly codable--then the use of the word provided by the will succeed quite well in conveying he content which the s eaker has in mind. If, on the other hand, the content of the JC is not very well captured by assigning it to the UC, then the speaker likely to add one or more modifiersto mold the content &apos;tore closely to the content Of the CC he has in mind AdVw?bs are an obvious dwice by which such molding is accomplished. Thus, the might decide that content of JO-1053 is better captured in an intersection of UC-&amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; and UC-&amp;quot;GfflDGING&amp;quot;: 28) 00-1053 3&gt; UC-&amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; c. UO-&amp;quot;nUDGIHG&amp;quot; in. which case the eventual lexicalization will be &amp;quot;give grudgingly&apos;, and not simply &amp;quot;give&amp;quot;. Suppose: 00-1053 is a conceptual chunk that will eventually be varbalized with the sentence: 28) Mrs. Brown gave Tommy a cookie. said that word &amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; is available as a for this Up to a point correct; there was a giving which took But sentence 28) contains more than the word &amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot;. of conceptual is conveyed by &amp;quot;MRS. &amp;quot;TOVEY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A COOKIE&amp;quot;: Each of these items communicates a conce;Dt is different in nature a 30. This other kind of 2oncept label a PI (for &amp;quot;particular individual&amp;quot;). The difference between a PI and a CC seems to have to ao with temporal particularity. A CC is conceived of as odcupying a specific and usually limited period of time. time period ocupied by, say, irs. Brown is much less snecific, and is not likely to be something we are very interested in when we utter a sentence like 28) In other words, although aJd may have temporal particularity in the sense of a lifespan or total time of existence, such a time period tends to be of a different order of magnit:ude from that occupied by a jC, and more often than not is of little relevance the is communicated. Furthermore, any one 1 may ticipate in an indeterminate number of different OCs. (Mrs. Brown has done many other things besides that which was reported in 28) ) 11137 do PIs play a necessary role in the communication of a CC? The answer may have something to do with the necessity for providing anchor points in the addressee&apos;s mind. Because of its lack of temporal particularity, the concept of a PI is a relatively concept, ana one which is liable consciousn-!ss again and again with respect to a wide variety of Cs. Thus, the only way a sT)eaker can effectively install. the content of a the addrssee s mind is to tie it to or more PIs already to the addressee. That i, the usual way information is by brinNing one or &apos;tore iI nodes into the addressee&apos;s and predicating something of these nodes. Lan Puage usually involves takin7, one PI (the &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot;) as a starting and either predicating something of it alone, or tying to other Is through a relational nredicate. It should be noted in passing that not everything which is syntactically as a noun is conceptually a 2I. &amp;quot;Tuesday&amp;quot; for exam le, be used as the name for what we 35 call a PT: a &amp;quot;particular time&amp;quot; which might be used to provide temporal orientation in a sentence like &amp;quot;On Tuesday Mrs. Brown gave Tommy a cookie.&amp;quot; In deciding to cateFoxize a CC in a ertain way, say -s an of a speaker simultineously a framework of PIs ehich a-e separated out from the cofttent of the 1 which will have to be linguistically represented in some In the case of these Is will function as arent, beneficiary,and patient(the giver, the givee, and the given). The fact that thesethree Is Ire entailed by the choice of tfl-&amp;quot;I/. is expressed as follow.s: 29) 00-A 0&gt; UJ-&amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; E&gt; CC-A F&gt; VB-&amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; (PI-Btku2, PI-0f110, The letters A, B, C, and D in this st tement are variables ranging over particular four digit nunbers. For eXa=le, CC-A might be 03-1053, PI-B might be PI-1687, etc. The sytbol E&gt; is to be read &amp;quot;entails&amp;quot;, and-F&gt; is to be read &amp;quot;is framed as &amp;quot;.

These other asects of lexical entries will be discussed below. To summarize, a CC of the a ,propriate size, arrived at through will to categorization in terms of some UC, the effect of which will be to 6roate, Iv way of the a verbal label for the top,ether with a framework of associ:xed nouns. The framing operation, in effect, will have factored out those elements (.PIs) having no significant temporal particularity, leaving a word (the VB) to which alone that teworal particularity will be assigned. It is probably a consequence of its being left with this temporal role that the V3 is likely to end up carrying a temfioral marker of some kind, such as a tense and or Rspect suffix. If, for.example, the JO occuPieq a temporal locus that )recedes the locus of the speech act, the VB is.likely to end up with a -oast tense suffix attached. ?his part of lexialization we &apos;all inflection.Its imolementation will be iliustrated immmediat ly below. Our orouiam tries to establish at the outset for each whether it can be ci!eorized, on the assuration th,gt_tIle s)eaker aiming at such catep;orization as and that subconcentualization takes place only when the content of the JC is such th.:it categorization is not appropriate. 2hus the first question asked of any CO is of the sort: V: BE answer is no, Vi-E2 :oes on to .isk how this .:,&amp;quot;J is to 37 subconceptualized, the example given in section III. If, on the other hand, the user&apos;s answer i yes, VAT will (7) on to ask question âelev nt to the tense/aspect properties of the JC. At present it. asks fiPst: 31) V: Iu C(J-!2053 GENERI? since special considerations have to be give to CCs that do not temporal particularity. If the answer to 51) is no, assumes by default that a temporal locus preceding that of the speech act. This is certainly the mdst probable state of affairs for most kinds of discourse. 4e would like eventually to. elaborate other )ossibilities, which are likely to depend on adverbial and other means of establishing temporal namicularity. Our program at present will, under these circumstances, add the inflectional notation &amp;quot;PAST&amp;quot; after a slasn,as in: 32) ,3C-1053 / &amp;quot;PAST&amp;quot; It is now time for the following exchange: 33) V: HJ;,J 16 &apos;,;C-1053 3ATEGORIZED? U: GIVL user says that the decision has been to this J an instance of the category tl-&amp;quot;dIVE&amp;quot;. VAT then looks into the lexicon and, on the basis of the last line in 29), roplaces 32) with: 34) VB-&amp;quot;GIVE&amp;quot; / GT PI-CtBEN PI-DITAT Two other consideration l are relevant at this point. For one VAT will want to replace the variables in 34) with particular four digit numbers. Our easiest recourse at present is to 7p have VAT ask the user about each PI: 35) V: WHAT IL; THE ILENT? U: PI-1234 V: &apos;/JHAT 1&apos;0 THE ;3MPICIARY? U: PI-1345 V: UHAT I3 THE PA2TNT? U: PI-1456 VAT will replace 34) 36) VB--&amp;quot;GIVu / PI-1234tAGT PI-1345tBEN 2I-1456tPAQ some of the answers to the questions in 3c) ought, under circumstances, to be derivr)ble from the context. iChope gradually to teach VAT to discover such -nswers for itself whenever Dossible. A second considertion at this point is to establish which PI is the subject or topic, the 1JI on which the speaker intends the addressee&apos;s attention to be focuse.d and concerning which something. be the easy way out is for VT to the 37) V: &apos;1HAT Li TI U: 11-1234 quetion in for a subject-prominent like English. If the verbalization is in a topic-prominent language VAT will msk instead about the topic (Li 1974). In English this may be the point at which functional relations such as agent, and patient should be by surface syntactic like object, and direct object. (In</abstract>
