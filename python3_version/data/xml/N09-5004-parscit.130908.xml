After the release of the open source software
implementation of Morfessor algorithm, a se-
ries of several open evaluations has been or-
ganized for unsupervised morpheme analy-
sis and morpheme-based speech recognition
and information retrieval. The unsupervised
morpheme analysis is a particularly attrac-
tive approach for speech and language tech-
nology for the morphologically complex lan-
guag es. When the amount of distinct word
forms becomes prohibitive for the construc-
tion of a sufficient lexicon, it is important
that the words can b e segmented into smaller
meaningful language modeling units. In this
presentation w e will demonstrate the results
of the evaluations, the baseline systems built
using the open source tools, and invite re-
search groups to participate in the next eval-
uation where the task is to enhance statistical
machine translation by morpheme analysis.

1 .1 The segmentation of words into
morphemes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985595571428571">
One of the fundamental tasks in natural language
processing applications, such as large-vocabulary
speech recognition (LVCSR), statistical machine
translation (S MT ) and information retrieval (IR),
is the morphological analysis of words. It is par-
ticularly important for the morphologically com-
plex languages, where the amount of different

word forms is substantially increased by inflection,
derivation and composition. The decomposition of
words is required not only for understanding the sen-
tence, but in many languages also for just represent-
ing the language by any tractable and trainable sta-
tistical model and lexicon. The manually composed
rule-based morphological analyzers can solve these
problems to some extent, but only a fraction of the
existing languages have been covered so far, and for
many the coverage of the relevant content is insuffi-
cient.
The objective of the Morpho Challeng e1 is to de-
sign and evaluate new unsupervised statistical ma-
chine learning algorithms that discover which mor-
phemes (smallest individually meaningful units of
language) words consist of. The goal is to discover
basic vocabulary units suitable for different tasks,
such as LVCSR, SMT and IR. In unsupervised learn-
ing the list of morphemes is not pre-specified for
each language, but the optimal morpheme lexicon
and morpheme analysis of all different word forms
is statistically optimized from a large text corpus in
a completely data-driven manner.
The evaluation of the morpheme analysis alg o-
rithms is performed both by a linguistic and an ap-
plication oriented task. The analysis obtained for
a long list of words is first compared to the lin-
guistic gold standard representing a grammatically
correct analysis by verifying that the morpheme-
sharing word pairs are the correct ones (Kurimo et
al., 2 007 ). This is repeated in different languages
and then the obtained decomposition of words is
applied in state-of-the-art systems running various

NLP applications. The suitability of the morphemes
is verified by comparing the performance of the sys-
tems to each other and to systems using unprocessed
words or conventional word processing algorithms
like stemming or rule-based decompositions.
A s a baseline method in all application, w e have
built systems by applying the Morfessor algorithm,
which is an unsupervised word decomposition alg o-
rithm developed at our research group (Creutz and
Lagus, 20 0 2) and released as open source software
implementation2.

1.2 Morphemes in Information Retrieval
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985882352941">
In information retrieval (IR) from text documents a
typical task is to look for the most relevant docu-
ments for a given query. One of the key challenges
is to reduce all the inflected word forms to a common
root or stem for effective indexing. From the mor-
pheme analysis point of view this task is to decom-
pose all the words in the query and text documents
and find out those common morphemes which form
the most relevant links.
In Morpho Challenge the IR systems built using
the unsupervised morpheme analysis algorithms are
compared in state-of-the-art CLEF tasks in Finnish,
German and English (Kurimo and Turunen, 200 8 )
using the mean average precision metric. The results
are also compared to those obtained by the grammat-
ical morphemes as well as the stemming and word
normalization methods conventionally used in IR .

1.3 Morphemes in Speech Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999583357142857">
In large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition
(LVCSR) one key part of the process is the statis-
tical language modeling which determines the prior
probabilities of all the possible word sequences. An
especially challenging task is to cover all the pos-
sible word forms with sufficient accuracy, because
any out-of-vocabulary words will not only be never
correctly recognized, but also severely degrade the
modeling of the other nearby words. B y decompos-
ing the words into meaningful sub-word units, such
as morphemes, large-vocabulary language models
can be successfully built even for the most difficult
agglutinative languages, like Finnish, Estonian and
Turkish (Kurimo et al., 20 06b).

In Morpho Challenge the unsupervised mor-
pheme algorithms have been compared by using
the morphemes to train statistical language models
and applying the models in state-of-the-art LVCSR
tasks in Finnish and Turkish (Kurimo et al., 20 0 6a).
Benchmarks for the same tasks were obtained by
models that utilize the grammatical morphemes as
well as traditional word-based language models.

1.4 Morphemes in Machine Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999867076923077">
The state-of-the-art statistical machine translation
(S MT) systems are affected by the morphological
variation of words at two different stages (Virpi-
oja et al., 20 07 ). In the first stage, the alignment
of the source and target language words in a par-
allel training corpus and the training of the transla-
tion model can benefit from the decomposition of
complex words into morphemes. This is particularly
important when either the target or the source lan-
guage, or both, are morphologically complex. The
final stage where the target language text is gener-
ated, may also require morpheme-based models, be-
cause the large-vocabulary statistical language mod-
els are applied in the same way as in LVCSR.
In the on-going Morpho Challenge 200 9 compe-
tition, the morpheme analysis algorithms are com-
pared in SMT tasks, where the analysis is needed
for the source language texts. The European Par-
liament parallel corpus (Koehn, 20 0 5 ) is used in
the evaluation. The source languages are Finnish
and German and the target in both tasks is English.
To obtain a state-of-the-art performance in the tasks
the morpheme-based SMT will be combined with a
word-based SMT using the Minimum Bayes Risk
(MB R) interpolation of the N-best translation hy-
pothesis of both systems (de Gispert et al., 200 9 ).
