Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.992984486486487">
The Fourth Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST-4) was held on 28
August 2010 following the Coling 2010 conference in Beijing. Like the first three SSST workshops
in 2007, 2008, and 2009, it aimed to bring together researchers from different communities working in
the rapidly growing field of statistical, tree-structured models of natural language translation.
We were honored to have Martin Kay deliver this year’s invited keynote talk. This field is indebted to
Martin Kay for not one but two of the classic cornerstone ideas that inspired bilingual tree-structured
models for statistical machine translation: first, chart parsing, and second, parallel text alignment.
Tabular approaches to parsing, using dynamic programming and/or memoization, were heavily
influenced by Kay’s (1980) charts (or forests, packed forests, well-formed substring tables, or WFSTs).
Today’s biparsing models—the bilingual generalizations of this influential work—lie at the heart of
numerous alignment and training algorithms for inversion transduction grammars or ITGs—including
all syntax-directed transduction grammars or SDTGs (or synchronous CFGs) of binary rank or ternary
rank, such as those learned by hierarchical phrase-based translation approaches.
At the same time, Kay and R¨oscheisen’s (1988) seminal work on alignment of parallel texts led the way
in statistical machine translation’s basic paradigm of integrating the simultaneous learning of translation
lexicons with aligning parallel texts. Today’s biparsing models generalize this by simultaneously
learning tree structures as well. Once again, cross-pollination of ideas across different areas and
disciplines, empirical and theoretical, has provided mutual inspiration.
We selected 15 papers for this year’s workshop. Studies emphasizing formal and algorithmic
aspects include a method for intersecting synchronous/transduction grammars (S/TGs) with finite-
state transducers (Dymetman and Cancedda), and a comparison of linear transduction grammars
(LTGs) with ITGs (Saers, Nivre and Wu). Experiments on using syntactic features and constraints
within flat phrase-based translation models include studies by Jiang, Du and Way; by Cao, Finch
and Sumita; by Kolachina, Venkatapathy, Bangalore, Kolachina and PVS; and by Zhechev and van
Genabith. Dependency constraints are also used to improve HMM word alignments for both flat
phrase-based as well as S/TG based translation models (Ma and Way). Extensions to the features and
parameterizations in two S/TG based translation models, as well as methods for merging models, are
studied by Zollman and Vogel. The potential of incorporating LFG-style deep syntax within S/TGs is
explored by Graham and van Genabith. A tree transduction based approach is presented by Khalilov and
Sima’an. Meanwhile, Lo and Wu empirically compare n-gram, syntactic, and semantic structure based
MT evaluation approaches. An encouraging trend is an uptick in work on low-resource language pairs
and from underrepresented regions, including English-Persian (Mohaghegh, Sarrafzadeh and Moir),
Manipuri-English (Singh and Bandyopadhyay), Tunisia (Khemakhem, Jamoussi and Ben hamadou),
and English-Hindi (Venkatapathy, Sangal, Joshi, and Gali).
Once again this year, thanks are due to our authors and our Program Committee for making the SSST
workshop another success.
