This demo presents Information Extraction
from discharge letters in Bulgarian lan-
guage. The Patient history section is au-
tomatically split into episodes (clauses be-
tween two temporal markers); then drugs,
diagnoses and conditions are recognised
within the episodes with accuracy higher
than 90%. The temporal markers, which re-
fer to absolute or relative moments of time,
are identified with precision 87% and re-
call 68%. The direction of time for the
episode starting point: backwards or for-
ward (with respect to certain moment ori-
enting the episode) is recognised with pre-
cision 74.4%.

<bodyText confidence="0.999965204081632">
Temporal information processing is a challenge in
medical informatics (Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007)
and (Hripcsak et al., 2005). There is no agree-
ment about the features of the temporal models
which might be extracted automatically from free
texts. Some sophisticated approaches aim at the
adaptation of TimeML-based tags to clinically-
important entities (Savova et al., 2009) while
others identify dates and prepositional phrases
containing temporal expressions (Angelova and
Boytcheva, 2011). Most NLP prototypes for auto-
matic temporal analysis of clinical narratives deal
with discharge letters.
This demo presents a prototype for automatic
splitting of the Patient history into episodes and
extraction of important patient-related events that
occur within these episodes. We process Elec-
tronic Health Records (EHRs) of diabetic pa-
tients. In Bulgaria, due to centralised regulations
on medical documentation (which date back to
the 60’s of the last century), hospital discharge
letters have a predefined structure (Agreement,
2005). Using the section headers, our Informa-
tion Extraction (IE) system automatically iden-
tifies the Patient history (Anamnesis). It con-
tains a summary, written by the medical expert
who hospitalises the patient, and documents the
main phases in diabetes development, the main
interventions and their effects. The splitting al-
gorithm is based on the assumption that the Pa-
tient history texts can be represented as a struc-
tured sequence of adjacent clauses which are po-
sitioned between two temporal markers and re-
port about some important events happening in
the designated period. The temporal markers are
usually accompanied by words signaling the di-
rection of time (backward or forward). Thus we
assume that the episodes have the following struc-
ture: (i) reference point, (ii) direction, (iii) tem-
poral expression, (iv) diagnoses, (v) symptoms,
syndromes, conditions, or complains; (vi) drugs;
(vii) treatment outcome. The demo will show
how our IE system automatically fills in the seven
slots enumerated above. Among all symptoms
and conditions, which are complex phrases and
paraphrases, the extraction of features related to
polyuria and polydipsia, weight change and blood
sugar value descriptions will be demonstrated.
Our present corpus contains 1,375 EHRs.

Temporal information is very important in clini-
cal narratives: there are 8,248 markers and 8,249
words/phrases signaling the direction backwards
or forward in the corpus (while the drug name oc-
currences are 7,108 and the diagnoses are 7,565).

In the hospital information system, there are
two explicitly fixed dates: the patient birth date
and the hospitalisation date. Both of them are
used as antecedents of temporal anaphora:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.955877916666667">
• the hospitalisation date is a reference point
for 37.2% of all temporal expressions (e.g.
’since 5 years’, ’(since) last March’, ’3 years
ago’, ’two weeks ago’, ’diabetes duration 22
years’, ’during the last 3 days’ etc.). For
8.46% of them, the expression allows for cal-
culation of a particular date when the corre-
sponding event has occurred;
• the age (calculated using the birth date) is a
reference point for 2.1% of all temporal ex-
pressions (e.g. ’diabetes diagnosed in the
age of 22 years’).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999762538461538">
Some 28.96% of the temporal markers refer to an
explicitly specified year which we consider as an
absolute reference. Another 15.1% of the markers
contain reference to day, month and year, and in
this way 44.06% of the temporal expressions ex-
plicitly refer to dates. Adding to these 44.06%
the above-listed referential citations of the hos-
pitalization date and the birth date, we see that
83.36% of the temporal markers refer to explic-
itly specified moments of time and can be seen
as absolute references. We note that diabetes is a
chronicle disease and references like ’diabetes di-
agnosed 30 years ago’ are sufficiently precise to
be counted as explicit temporal pointers.
The anaphoric expressions refer to events de-
scribed in the Patient history section: these ex-
pressions are 2.63% of the temporal markers (e.g.
’20 days after the operation’, ’3 years after di-
agnosing the diabetes’, ’about 1 year after that’,
’with the same duration’ etc.). We call these ex-
pressions relative temporal markers and note that
much of our temporal knowledge is relative and
cannot be described by a date (Allen, 1983).
The remaining 14% of the temporal markers
are undetermined, like ’many years ago’, ’before
the puberty’, ’in young age’, ’long-duration dia-
betes’. About one third of these markers refer to
periods e.g. ’for a period of 3 years’, ’with du-
ration of 10-15 years’ and need to be interpreted
inside the episode where they occur.
Identifying a temporal expression in some sen-
tence in the Patient history, we consider it as a
signal for a new episode. Thus it is very impor-
tant to recognise automatically the time anchors
of the events described in the episode: whether
they happen at the moment, designated by the
marker, after or before it. The temporal markers
are accompanied by words signaling time direc-
tion backwards or forward as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9961422">
• the preposition ’since’ (oT) unambiguously
designates the episode startpoint and the
time interval when the events happen. It oc-
curs in 46.78% of the temporal markers;
• the preposition ’in’ (rrpea) designates the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.984761">
episode startpoint with probability 92.14%.
It points to a moment of time and often
marks the beginning of a new period. But the
events happening after ’in’ might refer back-
wards to past moments, like e.g. ’diabetes
diagnosed in 2004, (as the patient) lost 20 kg
in 6 months with reduced appetite’. So there
could be past events embedded in the ’in’-
started episodes which should be considered
as separate episodes (but are really difficult
for automatic identification);
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9986344">
• the preposition ’after’ (sleA) unambigu-
ously identifies a relative time moment ori-
ented to the immediately preceding event
e.g. ’after that’ with synonym ’later’ e.g.
’one year later’. Another kind of reference
is explicit event specification e.g. ’after the
Maninil has been stopped’;
• the preposition ’before’ or ’ago’ (npeAu) is
included in 11.2% of all temporal markers in
our corpus. In 97.4% of its occurrences it is
associated to a number of years/months/days
and refers to the hospitalisation date, e.g.
’3 years ago’, ’two weeks ago’. In 87.6%
of its occurrences it denotes starting points
in the past after which some events hap-
pen. However, there are cases when ’ago’
marks an endpoint, e.g. ’Since 1995 the hy-
pertony 150/100 was treated by Captopril
25mg, later by Enpril 10mg but two years
ago the therapy has been stopped because of
hypotony’;
• the preposition ’during, throughout’ (R
npoAT,jr}xenue na) occurs relatively rarely,
only in 1.02% of all markers. It is usually
associated with explicit time period.

3 Recognition of Diagnoses and Drugs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999143090909091">
We have developed high-quality extractors of di-
agnoses, drugs and dosages from EHRs in Bulgar-
ian language. These two extracting components
are integrated in our IE system which processes
Patient history episodes.
Phrases designating diagnoses are juxtaposed
to ICD-10 codes (ICD, 10). Major difficulties in
matching ICD-10 diseases to text units are due to
(i) numerous Latin terms written in Latin or Cyril-
lic alphabets; (ii) a large variety of abbreviations;
(iii) descriptions which are hard to associate to
ICD-10 codes, and (iv) various types of ambigu-
ity e.g. text fragments that might be juxtaposed to
many ICD-10 labels.
The drug extractor finds in the EHR texts 1,850
brand names of drugs and their daily dosages.
Drug extraction is based on algorithms using reg-
ular expressions to describe linguistic patterns.
The variety of textual expressions as well as the
absent or partial dosage descriptions impede the
extraction performance. Drug names are juxta-
posed to ATC codes (ATC, 11).
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.990655" genericHeader="method">
4 IE of symptoms and conditions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994502">
Our aim is to identify diabetes symptoms and
conditions in the free text of Patient history.
The main challenge is to recognise automatically
phrases and paraphrases for which no ”canonical
forms” exist in any dictionary. Symptom extrac-
tion is done over a corpus of 1,375 discharge
letters. We analyse certain dominant factors when
diagnosing with diabetes - values of blood sugar,
body weight change and polyuria, polydipsia
descriptions. Some examples follow:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.871391333333333">
(i) Because of polyuria-polydipsia syndrome,
blood sugar was - 19 mmol/l.
(ii) ... on the background of obesity - 117 kg...
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974885714286">
The challenge in the task is not only to iden-
tify sentences or phrases referring to such expres-
sions but to determine correctly the borders of
the description, recognise the values, the direction
of change - increased or decreased value and to
check whether the expression is negated or not.
The extraction of symptoms is a hybrid method
which includes document classification and rule-
based pattern recognition. It is done by a 6-
steps algorithm as follows: (i) manual selection
of symptom descriptions from a training corpus;
(ii) compiling a list of keyterms per each symp-
tom; (iii) compiling probability vocabularies for
left- and right-border tokens per each symptom
description according to the frequencies of the
left- and right-most tokens in the list of symp-
tom descriptions; (iv) compiling a list of fea-
tures per each symptom (these are all tokens avail-
able in the keyterms list without the stop words);
(v) performing document classification for select-
ing the documents containing the symptom of in-
terest based on the feature selection in the previ-
ous step and (vi) selection of symptom descrip-
tions by applying consecutively rules employing
the keyterms vocabulary and the left- and right-
border tokens vocabularies. For overcoming the
inflexion of Bulgarian language we use stemming.
The last step could be actually segmented into
five subtasks such as: focusing on the expressions
which contain the terms; determining the scope of
the expressions; deciding on the condition wors-
ening - increased, decreased values; identifying
the values - interval values, simple values, mea-
surement units etc. The final subtask is to deter-
mine whether the expression is negated or not.

<bodyText confidence="0.999888166666667">
The evaluation of all linguistic modules is per-
formed in close cooperation with medical experts
who assess the methodological feasibility of the
approach and its practical usefulness.
The temporal markers, which refer to absolute
or relative moments of time, are identified with
precision 87% and recall 68%. The direction of
time for the episode events: backwards or for-
ward (with respect to certain moment orienting
the episode) is recognised with precision 74.4%.
ICD-10 codes are associated to phrases with
precision 84.5%. Actually this component has
been developed in a previous project where it
was run on 6,200 EHRs and has extracted 26,826
phrases from the EHR section Diagnoses; correct
ICD-10 codes were assigned to 22,667 phrases.
In this way the ICD-10 extractor uses a dictio-
nary of 22,667 phrases which designate 478 ICD-
10 disease names occurring in diabetic EHRs
(Boytcheva, 2011a).
Drug names are juxtaposed to ATC codes with
f-score 98.42%; the drug dosage is recognised
with f-score 93.85% (Boytcheva, 2011b). This
result is comparable to the accuracy of the best

systems e.g. MedEx which extracts medication
events with 93.2% f-score for drug names, 94.5%
for dosage, 93.9% for route and 96% for fre-
quency (Xu et al., 2010). We also identify the
drugs taken by the patient at the moment of
hospitalisation. This is evaluated on 355 drug
names occurring in the EHRs of diabetic pa-
tients. The extraction is done with f-score 94.17%
for drugs in Patient history (over-generation 6%)
(Boytcheva et al., 2011).
In the separate phases of symptom description
extraction the f-score goes up to 96%. The com-
plete blood sugar descriptions are identified with
89% f-score; complete weight change descrip-
tions - with 75% and complete polyuria and poly-
dipsia descriptions with 90%. These figures are
comparable to the success of extracting condi-
tions, reported in (Harkema et al., 2009).

6 Demonstration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996366419354838">
The demo presents: (i) the extractors of diag-
noses, drugs and conditions within episodes and
(ii) their integration within a framework for tem-
poral segmentation of the Patient history into
episodes with identification of temporal mark-
ers and time direction. Thus the prototype auto-
matically recognises the time period, when some
events of interest have occurred.
Example 1. (April 2004) Diabetes diagnosed
last August with blood sugar values 14mmol/l.
Since then put on a diet but without following
it too strictly. Since December follows the diet
but the blood sugar decreases to 12mmol/l. This
makes it necessary to prescribe Metfodiab in the
morning and at noon 1/2t. since 15.I. Since then
the body weight has been reduced with about 6 kg.
Complains offornication in the lower limbs.
This history is broken down into the episodes,
imposed by the time markers (table 1). Please
note that we suggest no order for the episodes.
This should be done by a temporal reasoner.
However, it is hard to cope with expressions
like the ones in Examples 2-5, where more than
one temporal marker occurs in the same sentence
with possibly diverse orientation. This requires
semantic analysis of the events happening within
the sentences. Example 2: Since 1,5 years with
growing swelling of the feet which became per-
manent and massive since the summer of 2003.
Example 3: Diabetes type 2 with duration 2 years,
diagnosed due to gradual body weight reduction

amenorrhoea after a childbirth 12 months ago, af-
ter the birth with ceased menstruation and with-
out lactation. Example 5: Now hospitalised 3
years after a radioiodine therapy of a nodular goi-
ter which has been treated before that by thyreo-
static medication for about a year.
In conclusion, this demo presents one step in
the temporal analysis of clinical narratives: de-
composition into fragments that could be consid-
ered as happening in the same period of time. The
system integrates various components which ex-
tract important patient-related entities. The rela-
tive success is partly due to the very specific text
genre. Further effort is needed for ordering the
episodes in timelines, which is in our research
agenda for the future. These results will be in-
tegrated into a research prototype extracting con-
ceptual structures from EHRs.

Thus the prototype automatically recognises the time period, when some events of interest have occurred. Example 1. (April 2004) Diabetes diagnosed last August with blood sugar values 14mmol/l. Since then put on a diet but without following it too strictly. Since December follows the diet but the blood sugar decreases to 1</context>
