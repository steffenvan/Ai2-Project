A collection of essays on historical method, the last
written in Latin with Ciceronian cadences, may not
seem appropriate for review in a journal devoted to
computational linguistics. Yet several of the essays
deal with methods pertinent for synchronic analysis, as
those noted here may indicate.
The editors have arranged the essays under four
topics: I. Linguistic Concepts (pp. 27-160), II. Lin-
guistic Stratums (161-284), III. Linguistic Systems
(285-493) and IV. Linguistic Attitudes (495-615).
Essays have separate bibliographies. A selected bibli-
ography of Penzl&apos;s publications (11-18), an essay on
linguistic method by Rauch (19-23) and an index
(619-630) complete the work. Well-prepared and
presented, the book as a whole, as well as Rauch&apos;s
essay, testify to the affection for Penzl and to the
respect for his achievements.
The first part includes a highly interesting essay by
James W. Marchand entitled Sagena piscatoris, with
the sub-title &amp;quot;an essay in medieval lexicography&amp;quot;
(123-137). The essay begins with a reinterpretation
of the Latin phrase used as title, proposing in contrast
with a different interpretation that it meant &apos;net of the
fisherman&apos; but also that it was a &amp;quot;patristic common-
place for &apos;Church&apos;. Thereupon Marchand discusses
relationships between the SIGNANS and SIGNATUM
applying during the medieval period, at the same time
chiding medieval lexicographers for neglecting such
meanings on the grounds that they are merely figura-
tive. He vigorously presents the position that
&amp;quot;throughout the Middle Ages, particularly in the lan-
guage of the Church, but penetrating all walks of life
and every kind of discourse words were thought to
have two kinds of meaning, literal and spiritual&amp;quot;
(125). His discussion and examples will interest any-
one concerned with meaning, such as the use of
Gideon&apos;s fleece for &apos;virgin Mary&apos; â€” also &apos;an unplowed
field&apos;, whether in Latin, medieval Spanish un prado
bien sin cido or medieval German anger ungebrachot.
Marchand asks that medieval dictionaries include such
meanings, as well as more remote derivations based on
medieval etymologies which we consider utterly fanci-
ful, such as caro datur vermibus, literally &apos;flesh is given
to worms&apos; for cadaver &apos;corpse&apos; and also used when an
author simply means &apos;corpse&apos;. Besides such citations
he provides examples of faulty interpretations by read-
ers ignorant of medieval conceptions of meaning.
Apart from the exhortation to medieval lexicographers
to repair previous inadequacies, Marchand makes the
point that &amp;quot;in dealing with a passage, we must observe
not only the immediate linguistic context, but also the
type of discourse in which it is found&amp;quot; (125). Compu-
tational linguists have of course propounded such
views from the earliest days of machine translation,
when microglossaries were widely advocated, as by
Reifler, with little impact on general linguistics. It is a
pleasure to read an article on a somewhat remote area
of language concern with such illuminating examples
supporting a more realistic view of language and its
interpretation. Current texts, especially in technical
and scientific fields, may not introduce a spiritual
alongside literal meanings, but terms like bit, hardware,
program cannot always be interpreted &amp;quot;literally&amp;quot; any
more than a medieval term like sagena.
The essay by the dean of Germanic linguists, Hugo
Moser, also relates to interests of computational lin-
guists, in pointing to occupational and special lan-
guages: &amp;quot;Zur Problematik der Fach- und Sonderspra-
chen&amp;quot; (139-151). Moser discusses their twofold treat-
ment, on the one hand in sociolinguistic study, on the
other in pragmalinguistics, in this country known as
pragmatics. In his discussion, he points out that while
some occupational languages have been capably stud-
ied, such as the language of chemistry, many &amp;quot;special
languages&amp;quot; have not, and he indicates problems that
must be noted in dealing with these. Like Marchand&apos;s,
his essay also directs attention to complexities that
must be faced in dealing with lexicon of natural lan-
guages. Several articles illustrate points he is making,
e.g., Michael G. Clyne&apos;s &amp;quot;Linguistic analysis and the
1972 Bundestag election campaign&amp;quot; (163-173) and
Irmengard Rauch&apos;s &amp;quot;Semantic naturalness and word-
building: East German Nur-&amp;quot;(253-263). These illus-
trate the importance of sociolinguistic and pragmatic
attention to all linguistic materials, or as Clyne puts it,
&amp;quot;The main thing is that we do not lose sight of the
portion of reality we are investigating&amp;quot; (172).
In the area of grammar Albert L. Lloyd&apos;s article is
of broad interest. Entitled &amp;quot;Prolegomena to a theory
of Gothic verbal aspect&amp;quot; (327-346), it proposes to
deal with aspect generally, at any rate, aspect in the
Indo-European languages. The article succeeds as well
as any in this difficult and often debated area. Lloyd&apos;s
definition of aspect agrees with that of other analysts,
&amp;quot;Aspect refers to the position chosen by the reporter
as the point of observation on which his report of a
non-present phenomenon is based&amp;quot; (343). Using
&amp;quot;normal aspectual pairs in Russian&amp;quot; as a guide, he

identifies types of verbs which remain outside the
area: statals, e.g. &apos;know&apos;, and punctuals, e.g. &apos;find&apos;.
The basic problem then concerns what he calls
&amp;quot;processives.&amp;quot; These he analyzes more precisely,
chiefly with examples from Gothic but also with refer-
ence to Greek and English, in a treatment too detailed
for presentation in the space allotted here. Since,
however, the analysis of verbs in a grammar is of fun-
damental importance, especially in computational lin-
guistics and artificial intelligence with their heavy reli-
ance on case theory, Lloyd&apos;s article will repay careful
study by readers of this journal. His proposed longer
work following the &amp;quot;prolegomena&amp;quot; may also be kept in
mind.
Many other articles not mentioned here are of in-
terest, also, for specialists in computational linguistics.
Anyone teaching a course in grammar testing might,
for example, ask students to program the rules in Jo-
seph B. Voyles&apos;s &amp;quot;The phonology of the Old High
German Tatian&amp;quot; (441-493). Besides testing the com-
pleteness and accuracy of his formalizations, a pro-
grammed phonology would be of no little interest in
presenting forms in the scantily attested early period
of German. The availability in English of an article
&amp;quot;On some linguistic methods&amp;quot; (521-546) on views of
Soviet scholarship by a highly regarded scholar, G.S.
Seur, illustrates a further reason for readers of this
journal not to disregard this volume. One may dis-
agree with some of Rues statements, for example, his
&amp;quot;dissatisfaction with typology, whose chief aim is clas-
sification&amp;quot; (530); actually, typological study of syntax
has provided some of the best means for insights into
the development of language and for explanations,
especially when one moves beyond characteristics like
adjective: noun and genitive: noun, or preposi-
tion:postposition structures. Yet this and many other
articles raise important questions, in a handsome trib-
ute. In lauding a historical linguist, a highly appropri-
ate conclusion is an article on views of a major linguist
concerning the enduring problem of deep and surface
structure: &amp;quot;Quomodo superficiei grammaticae nexus
sensusque profundior in Jespersenii Syntaxi analytica
dicta tractentur&amp;quot; (601-615) by Ladislaus Zgusta.
