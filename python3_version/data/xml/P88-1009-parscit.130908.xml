<bodyText confidence="0.9999243">
An analysis of English tense and aspect is pre-
sented that specifies temporal precedence relations
within a sentence. The relevant reference points
for interpretation are taken to be the initial and
terminal points of events in the world, as well as
two &amp;quot;hypothetical&amp;quot; times: the perfect time (when
a sentence contains perfect aspect) and the pro-
gressive or during time. A method for providing
temporal interpretation for nontensed elements in
the sentence is also described.

The analysis of tense and aspect requires spec-
ifying what relations can or cannot hold among
times and events, given a sentence describing those
events.1 For example, a specification of the mean-
ing of the past-tense sentence &amp;quot;John ate a cake&amp;quot;
involves the fact that the time of the main event —
in this case, the cake-eating event — precedes the
time of utterance of the sentence. Various pro-
posals have also been made regarding the analysis
of aspect which involve auxiliary times or events,
whereby the proper relationship of these auxiliary
times or events to &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; main events is specified.
We provide an analysis of English tense and
aspect that involves specifying relations among
times rather than events. We also offer a means of
interpreting tenseless elements like nouns and ad-
jectives whose interpretation may be temporally
dependent. For example, the noun phrase &amp;quot;the
warm cakes&amp;quot; picks out different sets of cakes, de-
pending on the time relative to which it &apos;receives
an interpretation.
The analysis presented here has been imple-
mented with the Prolog data base query system

CHAT (Pereira 1983), and the representations are
based on those used in that system. We shall
show that an analysis of tense and aspect involv-
ing specification of relations among times rather
than among events results in a clean analysis of
various types of sentences.

2. Time Points
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984957848484849">
Harper and Charniak (1986) [henceforth H&amp;C]
provide an interesting and revealing analysis of
English tense and aspect involving relations be-
tween events. There are several kinds of events:
the utterance event, which is associated with the
time of the utterance; the main event, or the event
being described by the main verb of the sentence;
the perfect event; and the progressive event. The
representation of every sentence involves the ut-
terance event and the main event; sentences with
progressive or perfect aspect also involve progres-
sive or perfect events.
This treatment is quite different from the Re-
ichenbach (1947) conception of &amp;quot;reference time&amp;quot;,
which is assumed to be relevant for all sentences.
To translate between the two systems, the refer-
ence time may be thought of as being represented
by the perfect event in perfect sentences and by
the progressive event in progressive sentences. In
the case of perfect progressives, one might con-
sider that there are two reference events, while in
simple tenses there is no reference event at all.
Alternatively, in a system like Webber (1987) in
which reference points for each sentence are used
to construct an event structure, the tensed event
(what H&amp;C call the &amp;quot;anchor event&amp;quot;) is the rele-
vant one: the perfect event for sentences with per-
fect aspect; for sentences with progressive but no
perfect aspect, the progressive event; or the main
event for simple tense sentences.2
2 Although instants rather than events are used in the
representation described here, a similar strategy would be
employable in building up a Webber-style event structure.

In accordance with H&amp;C, we propose perfect
reference points for sentences with perfect aspect
and progressive reference points for sentences with
progressive aspect. Thus, the interpretation of
each sentence involves a number of relevant times:
the beginning and end of the event described by
the main verb for all sentences, the perfect time if
it has perfect aspect, and the progressive time if
it has progressive aspect. In our analysis, unlike
H&amp;C, what is relevant for the interpretation of
sentences is not a set of events (which have po-
tential duration and beginning and end points)
but a set of times or instants. Instants, unlike
events, have no beginning or end: they are one-
dimensional points. This has several advantages
over an analysis such as H&amp;C, in which the per-
fect and progressive reference points are events.
First, if the reference points for perfect and pro-
gressive sentences are events rather than instants,
it ought to be possible to predicate duration of
them. However, this is not a possible option for
perfect and progressive sentences; durational ad-
juncts are only interpreted relative to the main
event. The sentence &amp;quot;John has swum for three
hours&amp;quot; is only true when the duration of the main
event (the swimming event) is three hours.
Second, relations among events in H&amp;C&apos;s sys-
tem reduce anyway to relations between instants:
the starting and ending points of events. That is,
the primitives of systems like H&amp;C&apos;s are relations
among times. There seems to be little to be gained
from constructing hypothetical events based on
these relations when a simpler and cleaner analysis
can be constructed on the basis of these primitive
notions alone.
There might seem to be the following objection
to adopting times as relevant for the interpreta-
tion of sentences: given a sentence like &apos;John was
frosting a cake from 3:00 to 4:00 yesterday&apos;, we
know about the progressive reference point only
that it lies between 3:00 and 4:00; there are in-
finitely many instants satisfying that condition.
It would be impossible to iterate over all of these
times to determine the truth of any utterance. In
fact, though, to determine whether a sentence con-
taining perfect or progressive aspect is true, it is
unnecessary to instantiate the perfect or progres-
sive reference times to specific values; it suffices to
show that an interval exists within which such a
point can be found. That is, they are merely ex-
istentially quantified, not instantiated to a value.
In this manner, perfect or progressive times may
give the appearance of being similar to events with
a starting and an ending point, because they are
constrained only to exist within some nonnull in-
terval. Checking whether or not the sentence is
true involves determining whether the interval ex-
ists.
The following is the representation for the sim-
ple past sentence &amp;quot;John frosted a cake&amp;quot;, with
words in upper case representing variables and
words in lower case representing predicate names
or constants:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996929">
(1) exists X Start End
holds(frost(john, X), Start, End)
cake(X)
6 precede(End, now)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999172708333333">
The predicate holds in the first clause of the repre-
sentation takes three arguments, representing the
predicate and the beginning and ending times of
the event. In other words, John frosted X from
time Start to time End. The predicate cake(X)
specifies that the thing John frosted was a cake.
We do not represent this with a holds predicate
because we assume that the property of being a
cake is a static property, not one that changes over
time.3
The predicate precede(End, now) specifies that
the ending time End of the cake-frosting event
must precede now, the current time. In the course
of validating this logical form, the variable End
will be instantiated to a numerical value, and the
atom now will be replaced by the value of the cur-
rent time. The predicate precede represents the
less-than-or-equal-to relation, while the predicate
strictly_precede represents the less-than relation.
Thus, the cake-frosting event must occur in the
past.
Let us next consider the semantic representation
of a sentence with perfect aspect, &amp;quot;John will have
frosted a cake&amp;quot;:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6558524">
(2) exists X Start End Perfect
holds(frost(john, X), Start, End)
cake(X)
precede(End, Perfect)
strictly_precede(now, Perfect)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9712796">
3This is not a necessary part of the analysis; the repre-
sentation has been chosen in part for the sake of simplicity.
It would also be possible to represent the predicate cake(X)
inside a holds predicate, with the Start and End times rep-
resenting when the cake began and ceased to exist.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99981945">
The interpretation of perfect sentences involves
a perfect time Perfect. This time is constrained
to follow the main event; this is enforced by the
clause precede(End, Perfect). Since this is a future
perfect sentence, Perfect is constrained to be in
the future. The future tense is represented by the
predicate strictly_precede; the perfect time must
follow now (not coincide with it).
Note, therefore, that in the case of future per-
fect sentences the main event is required only to
end before a time in the future, and that (as with
H&amp;C) it is not a contradiction to say &amp;quot;John will
have arrived by tomorrow, and he may already
have arrived.&amp;quot; Unlike analyses in which relations
among all reference points are fully specified, this
analysis allows the main event to be in the past
even though the sentence itself is in the future per-
fect.
The following is a representation of the past pro-
gressive &amp;quot;John was frosting a cake&amp;quot;:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8416815">
(3) exists X Start End Progressive
holds(frost(john, X), Start, End)
81 cake(X)
81 precede(Start, Progressive)
6 precede(Progressive, End)
81 precede(Progressive, now)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997979375">
Here the progressive time, represented by the
variable Progressive, must occur during the cake-
frosting event; that is, it must occur after the start
and before the end of the main event. Since the
sentence is a past progressive, there is a final re-
quirement on Progressive: it must precede now.
Notice that past progressives differ from simple
past sentences in that it is the progressive time
and not the ending time of the main event that
is required to be in the past. Consequently, as in
H&amp;C, the interpretation of a past progressive like
&amp;quot;John was frosting a cake&amp;quot; does not require that
the main event lie entirely in the past, but only
that some part of it be in the past. The present
analysis allows for the possibility that sentences
like the following can be true:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8038445">
(4) John was frosting a cake at 3:00, and he is
still frosting it.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949571428571">
We shall see in the next section that what was
referred to as the progressive time in the forego-
ing example actually appears in the representation
not only of progressives, but of every sentence, as
what we shall call the during time. The during
time will be used in the temporal interpretation of
nontensed elements in the sentence. For this rea-
son, the above representations of the simple past
and future perfect sentences above were only a first
approximation; actually, their complete represen-
tations also contain a during time.
Finally, the representation of a sentence with
both progressive and perfect aspect, like &amp;quot;John
will have been frosting a cake&amp;quot;, is the following:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.923398">
(5) exists X Start End Progressive Perfect
holds(frost(john, X), Start, End)
84 cake(X)
prucede(Start, Progressive)
6 precede(Progressive, End)
6 precede(Progressive, Perfect)
strictly_precede(now, Perfect)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914315789474">
Progressive, the progressive or during time, occurs
during the cake-frosting event. Progressive is con-
strained by the clause precede(Progressive, Per-
fect) to precede the perfect time Perfect. In other
words, for a perfect progressive sentence, the re-
quirement is that some portion of the main event
lie before the perfect time. The perfect time is con-
strained by the clause strictly_precede(now, Per-
fect) to lie in the future.
In this analysis, underspecification of relations
among times yields results that match the natural-
language semantics of sentences.4 Use of a perfect
and a progressive time allows uniform treatment
of perfects and progressives without the compli-
cation of introducing unwarranted pseudo-events
into the representation of simple tenses. Also, the
progressive/during time is useful as an anchor for
the interpretation of nontensed elements, as we
will see below.

3. Temporal Interpretation of Nontensed
Elements
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.868486833333333">
Not only tensed verbs, but also other nontensed
elements in the sentence — adjectives, nouns,
prepositions, and so on — must be temporally in-
terpreted. Consider the sentence &amp;quot;Are there any
warm cakes?&amp;quot; The adjective &amp;quot;warm&amp;quot; must be in-
terpreted relative to some time: in this case, the
4 We have not yet enriched the representation of individ-
ual predicates to include inherent aspect, as described in,
fcc example, Passoneau (1987). We feel, though, that the
resulting representations will still involve the use of perfect
and during times, and will still be amenable to the treat-
ment of nontensed elements described in the next section.

present. The question is about cakes that are cur-
rently warm.
The interpretation of nontensed elements does
not always depend on the utterance time, though.
The sentence &amp;quot;The third-year students had to take
an exam last year&amp;quot; can be interpreted in two ways.
Under one interpretation, those who were third-
year students last year (the current fourth-year
students) had to take a test last year. The inter-
pretation of the noun phrase &amp;quot;the third-year stu-
dents&amp;quot; is dependent on the tense of the main verb
in this case. Under the other interpretation, those
who are currently third-year students took a test
last year, when they were second-year students.
However, the interpretation of nontensed ele-
ments with respect to the tense of the main verb
in the sentence is not entirely unconstrained. Con-
sider the sentence &amp;quot;The wife of the president was
working in K-Mart in 1975.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Wife&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;presi-
dent&amp;quot; are both predicates that must be interpreted
with respect to a particular time. The current
president is not the same as the 1975 president;
if he divorced and remarried, his 1975 wife is not
necessarily the same person as his current wife.
Given this, there ought to be four possible inter-
pretations of this sentence. In fact, there are only
three:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992762">
• He is the current president and she is his cur-
rent wife
• He is the current president and she was his
wife in 1975
• He was the president in 1975 and she was
his wife then (but perhaps he is divorced and no
longer president)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.663441">
The missing interpretation is that
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.954945">
• He was the president in 1975 and she is his
current wife (but was not his wife then)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.964392567164179">
A skeletal tree for this example is shown in Fig-
ure 1. The sentence involves the syntactic embed-
ding of one NP (&amp;quot;the president&amp;quot;) inside another
NP (&amp;quot;the wife&amp;quot;). The unavailable interpretation
is one in which the embedded NP is interpreted
with respect to the event time of the higher verb,
whereas the intervening NP is not. That is, the
unavailable interpretation involves interpreting a
discontinuous portion of the parse tree of the sen-
tence with respect to the main verb.5
5 As we will see in the next section, it is possible to con-
struct a context in which the &amp;quot;missing interpretation&amp;quot; is in
fact available for this sentence. The claim made here is that
this interpretation is not available by means of the syntactic
variable-passing mechanism discussed in this section, but
One may think of the main-verb event time as
being passed or disseminated through the tree. It
may be passed down to embedded predicates in
the tree only when it is passed through interme-
diate predicates and used in their interpretation.
If a predication is interpreted with respect to the
current time rather than to the event time of the
main verb, all predications that are syntactically
subordinate to it are also interpreted with respect
to the current time. When this happens, the main-
verb event time ceases to be passed down and may
not be reinstated for interpretation.
Note, however, that the verb time and the time
with respect to which the nontensed elements are
interpreted are not always completely coextensive.
Consider again the example &amp;quot;John will be frost-
ing a warm cake at 3:00.&amp;quot; Under the interpreta-
tion that the cake is warm while John is frosting
it, the time span during which the cake is warm
must include the time 3:00; however, the starting
and ending points of the cake-frosting event need
not coincide exactly with the starting and ending
points of the interval at which the cake is warm.
The only requirement is that both events must
hold at 3:00.
Now consider the sentence &amp;quot;John built a new
house.&amp;quot; The building event can be thought of as
beginning before the event of the house&apos;s being
new. At the start of the building event, there is
no house, nor, obviously, is there is any event of
the house&apos;s being new. In a situation like this, one
does not want to require that the building event
be coextensive with the event of the house&apos;s being
new, but rather, merely to require that the two
events should overlap.
Our claim is that, in general, temporal interpre-
tation of nontensed elements relative to the tense
of the main verb of the sentence requires only that
the event denoted by the main verb overlap (not be
coextensive with or be contained in) the events de-
noted by the nontensed elements. We shall accom-
plish this by positing a time for each tensed verb,
the during time, and passing this time through the
syntactic tree. The event denoted by the main
verb, as well as the events denoted by any predi-
cates interpreted relative to the main verb, must
hold at this during time.
For example, here is the logical form for the sen-
tence &amp;quot;John frosted a warm cake&amp;quot;:
is only available by appealing to the context constructed.
The &amp;quot;missing interpretation&amp;quot; is missing when there is no
context to refer to for additional interpretations.

There are two predicates in this example that
are interpreted with respect to a temporal inter-
val: warm and frost. There must be a during time
During that occurs during both the cake-frosting
event and the event of the cake&apos;s being warm: the
two events must overlap.
We further note that all elements within a NP
node are interpreted with respect to the same
event. It is not possible, for example, to interpret
some elements of a noun phrase with respect to the
time of utterance, others with respect to the main
verb&apos;s during time. Consider the sentence &amp;quot;John
frosted three stale warm cakes yesterday.&amp;quot; Despite
the pragmatic predilection for interpreting &amp;quot;stale&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;warm&amp;quot; at different times (it is hard to imag-
ine how cakes that are still warm could already be
stale), this sentence has only two interpretations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99076675">
• John frosted three cakes that were both stale
and warm yesterday.
• John frosted three cakes yesterday that are
both stale and warm now.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998721666666667">
It is not possible to give the sentence the interpre-
tation that the cakes he frosted were warm yes-
terday and are stale now, or were stale yesterday
and are warm now. Both adjectives must be in-
terpreted with respect to the same time.
If a system like H&amp;C, in which events and
not instants are taken to be the relevant refer-
ence points, were extended to include interpre-
tation of nontensed elements as described here,
such a system might use primitives such as those
of Allen (1984). However, none of the primi-
tives of Allen&apos;s system is suitable for defining the
relation of the during time to the main event:
during(DuringEvent, MainEvent) is not sufficient,
since Allen&apos;s &amp;quot;during&amp;quot; relation does not permit the
DuringEvent to coincide with the beginning or end
points of the main event. The example &amp;quot;John
built a new house&amp;quot; shows that this is necessary;
in this case, it is precisely the end point of the
building event that coincides with the beginning
of the event of the house being new. In a system
using Allen&apos;s primitives, the proper relation be-
tween the DuringEvent and the MainEvent would
be a disjunction:

4. Passing the During Time: Rules for
Temporal Interpretation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999575333333333">
In the previous section, we examined the tem-
poral interpretation of phrases with respect to
the during time of the main verb. In addition,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995904">
72
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999693">
we proposed a constraint on the passing of this
during time from the verb through its arguments
and adjuncts, according to which predicates inter-
preted according to the during time must occupy
a nondiscontinuous portion of the tree. From the
point of view of the tenseless phrase, however, the
same process can be seen in a different light.
We may think of the interpretation of tempo-
rally dependent elements in a phrase as proceeding
in the following manner:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.769178777777778">
• The phrase is interpreted with respect to a
temporal modifier internal to the phrase; other-
wise
• The phrase is interpreted with respect to the
closest higher tensed element (allowing for restric-
tions on the distribution of the during variable);
otherwise •
• The phrase is interpreted with respect to some
contextually relevant time.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995647826087">
Temporally dependent nontensed elements in
previous sections were always contained in phrases
that lacked internal temporal modifiers, so the first
option was not applicable. One of two interpreta-
tions was given for tenseless elements: they were
interpreted either with respect to the during time
of the main verb or with respect to now, the time
of utterance. Interpretation with respect to now
seems to be a particular instance of the general
possibility of interpretation with respect to a con-
textually relevant time; since no context was given
for the examples in the previous sections, no other
contextually relevant time was available. When a
phrase contains a phrase-internal temporal modi-
fier, the predicates in that phrase must be inter-
preted with respect to that modifier, as in the ex-
ample &amp;quot;The 1975 president is living in California.&amp;quot;
The modifier &amp;quot;1975&amp;quot; in the phrase &amp;quot;the 1975 pres-
ident&amp;quot; provides the temporal interpretation of the
phrase: it must be interpreted with respect to that
time. It is not possible to interpret &amp;quot;president&amp;quot;
relative to the during time of the main verb.
Hinrichs (1987) also proposes that noun phrases
be interpreted relative to a time restricted by the
context; the difference between his analysis and
ours is that, of the three options presented above,
he offers only the last. He contends that the only
option for temporal interpretation of nontensed el-
ements is the third one, namely, by reference to
context.
Given an analysis like that of Hinrichs, it is dif-
ficult to explain the facts noted in the preceding
section. In the absence of context (or when the
sole context is the moment of utterance), Hinrichs
would not predict the absence of one reading for
sentences such as &amp;quot;The wife of the president was
working in K-Mart in 1975.&amp;quot; In an analysis like
the one presented here, where the interpretation
of nontensed elements is determinable in some in-
stances through syntactic processes, the absence
of these readings is expected.
Enc (1981) and Hinrichs (1987) both argue con-
vincingly that there are many instances in which a
temporally dependent element is interpreted with
respect to a time that is neither the during time
nor now. Hinrichs furnishes the following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.964952">
(8) Oliver North&apos;s secretary testified before the
committee.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9971125">
At the time she testified, she was no longer his sec-
retary; she-was also not his secretary at the time
this sentence was uttered. The sentence would re-
ceive the following interpretation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.980491666666667">
(9) exists X Start! Endl During!
Stara End2 During2
holds(secretary(north, X), Start!, Endl)
&amp; precede(Startl, During!)
&amp; precede(Duringl, End!)
&amp; holds(testify(X), Start2, End2)
&amp; precede(Stard, During2)
&amp; precede(During2, Elia)
&amp; precede(Duringe, now)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922333333333">
There are two events described in the logical form
of this sentence: the event of X being North&apos;s sec-
retary and the event of X testifying. During! is a
time during the being-a-secretary event, and Dur-
ing2 is a time during the testifying event. The
events are not required to overlap, and only the
&amp;quot;testify&amp;quot; event is restricted by the tense of the
sentence to occur in the past. In a more complete
representation, appropriate restrictions would be
imposed on During!: the time during which X is
a secretary would be restricted by the context, in
line with Hinrichs&apos; suggestions.

<bodyText confidence="0.999967571428571">
It appears that the during time of the main
clause is used in the interpretation of some tensed
subordinate clauses: for example, in the interpre-
tation of relative clauses. Consider the sentence

both events take place in the future. In this case,
the interpretation of the main verb in the relative
clause depends on the during time of the main
clause. There is also another interpretation, ac-
cording to which the dog that will be caught later
is running now. In this case, the interpretation of
the relative clause depends on the time of utter-
ance of the sentence.
One remaining task is to provide a reasonable
analysis of the bare present using this system. We
feel that such an analysis awaits the incorporation
of a representation of inherent lexical aspect as in
Passoneau (1987); without a representation of the
distinction between (for example) states and activ-
ities, a coherent representation of simple present
tense sentences is not possible.

We have shown that distributing an existen-
tially quantified during time variable throughout
the tree enables interpretation of nontensed ele-
ments in the sentence according to the time of the
main verb. Further, the during time is useful in the
interpretation of several sentence types: progres-
sives, statives, and sentences containing relative
clauses. Finally, an analysis that utilizes under-
specified relations among times (not events) pro-
vides a good prospect for analyzing tense and as-
pect in English.

It is not possible to give the sentence the interpretation that the cakes he frosted were warm yesterday and are stale now, or were stale yesterday and are warm now. Both adjectives must be interpreted with respect to the same time. If a system like H&amp;C, in which events and not instants are taken to be the relevant reference points, were extended to include interpretation of nontensed elements as described here, such a system might use primitives such as those of Allen (1984). However, none of the primitives of Allen&apos;s system is suitable for defining the relation of the during time to the main event: during(DuringEvent, MainEvent) is not sufficient, since Allen&apos;s &amp;quot;during&amp;quot; relation does not permit the DuringEvent to coincide with the beginning or end points of the main event. The example &amp;quot;John built a new house&amp;quot; shows that this is necessary; in this case, it is precisely the end point of the building event that coincides with the beginning of the event of the house being new.

In the absence of context (or when the sole context is the moment of utterance), Hinrichs would not predict the absence of one reading for sentences such as &amp;quot;The wife of the president was working in K-Mart in 1975.&amp;quot; In an analysis like the one presented here, where the interpretation of nontensed elements is determinable in some instances through syntactic processes, the absence of these readings is expected. Enc (1981) and Hinrichs (1987) both argue convincingly that there are many instances in which a temporally dependent element is interpreted with respect to a time that is neither the during time nor now. Hinrichs furnishes the following example: (8) Oliver North&apos;s secretary testified before the committee. At the time she testified, she was no longer his secretary; she-was also not his secretary at the time this sentence was uttered. The sentence would receive the following interpretation: (9) exists X Start! Endl During! Stara End2 During2 holds(secretary(north, X), Start!, Endl) &amp; precede(Startl, Durin</context>

When a phrase contains a phrase-internal temporal modifier, the predicates in that phrase must be interpreted with respect to that modifier, as in the example &amp;quot;The 1975 president is living in California.&amp;quot; The modifier &amp;quot;1975&amp;quot; in the phrase &amp;quot;the 1975 president&amp;quot; provides the temporal interpretation of the phrase: it must be interpreted with respect to that time. It is not possible to interpret &amp;quot;president&amp;quot; relative to the during time of the main verb. Hinrichs (1987) also proposes that noun phrases be interpreted relative to a time restricted by the context; the difference between his analysis and ours is that, of the three options presented above, he offers only the last.

Also, the progressive/during time is useful as an anchor for the interpretation of nontensed elements, as we will see below. 3. Temporal Interpretation of Nontensed Elements Not only tensed verbs, but also other nontensed elements in the sentence — adjectives, nouns, prepositions, and so on — must be temporally interpreted. Consider the sentence &amp;quot;Are there any warm cakes?&amp;quot; The adjective &amp;quot;warm&amp;quot; must be interpreted relative to some time: in this case, the 4 We have not yet enriched the representation of individual predicates to include inherent aspect, as described in, fcc example, Passoneau (1987).

The question is about cakes that are currently warm. The interpretation of nontensed elements does not always depend on the utterance time, though.
