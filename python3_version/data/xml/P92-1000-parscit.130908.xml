PREFACE

<bodyText confidence="0.987834869565217">
This volume contains the papers prepared for the 30th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics, held 28 June-2 July in Newark, Delaware. Following on from last year&apos;s
innovation, papers presented at the separate student session are also to be found, gathered in a separate
section at the end of this Proceedings.
In keeping with the prestigious nature of the meeting, and despite a number of alternative
conferences in our area, the programme committee was once again confronted with a large number of
very high quality submissions from around the world. Balancing our desire to accept as many as possible
of those which merited inclusion with the need to present a conference programme which ordinary
mortals could reasonably be expected to benefit from proved, as always, a difficult challenge. We hope
the results, as represented by the conference itself and the papers collected here, will stand as a fair and
representative cross-section of the best work in the field today.
Many people contributed to the success of this year&apos;s meeting, and I&apos;m happy to have the
opportunity of recording our thanks to them: to Martin Kay, Karen Sparck Jones and Don Walker, for the
invited talks; to Bonnie Webber, for organising the excellent set of tutorial sessions; to Keith Devlin,
William Gale, Joseph Kruskal, Mark Liberman, Mitch Marcus, Yves Schabes and Stuart Shieber for
presenting the tutorials; to Sandra Carberry, Dan Chester and Kathleen McCoy, for handling the local
arrangements; to David Traum and Lenhard Schubert for organising the Student Sessions; and finally to
Don Walker and Betty Walker for their stalwart labours behind the scenes.
In a year when over seven hundred papers in the field were submitted for consideration by a number
of meetings, reviewers&apos; time and effort was at a premium, with many people being asked to read papers
for several different meetings. My special thanks therefore to the programme committee members who
read and diligently commented on large numbers of submissions, did so to a very tight timetable, and
then participated in the traditional pressure cooker face-to-face programme committee meeting: Peter

Also this year we introduced a new approach to getting specialist reviews as an additional source of
input into the programme selection process, making official the unofficial practice of previous years.
Those listed on the reverse of this page were all recruited by the programme committee and contributed
reviews. Their gracious acquiescence in a role thrust on them at short notice and the helpful and detailed
response they produced merit our sincere thanks.

Statistics for Computational Linguists

<bodyText confidence="0.986542">
As linguistic corpora get larger, computational linguists are turning increasingly to statistical techniques. This tutorial
focusses on statistical techniques that have been useful in linguistic research, being careful to avoid those that have not been. For
each method we review its strengths and weaknesses, and the conditions under which it it may or may not be used. The tutorial
provides references to statistical texts, but does NOT include mathematical derivations. Graphical displays are used where
possible to show the qualitative behavior of methods.
The review starts with some very basic tools, such as methods for estimating the frequency of a token (word or n-gram),
especially in the important but subtle case when the token has not occurred in the training sample. We emphasize the sometimes
underappreciated importance of uncertainty (variability, standard deviation) of estimates. The foundations of the Bayesian
approach to statistics are reviewed, because the approach has been found useful in such widely different contexts as author
identification, information retrieval, and sense disambiguation. A general orientation to such broadly useful tools as clustering,
factor analysis/principal components analysis, and multidimensional scaling is included.

The use of an adjunction operation on elementary trees as the primitive operation of a grammar formalism was first
proposed by Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi in the mid 1970&apos;s. Since then, a series of formalisms based on tree adjunction, under the
name tree-adjoining grammars (TAG), have been defined and their properties explored. Certain attractive properties of tree-
adjoining grammars have led to their being proposed as solutions to a wide variety of natural-language-processing problems.
In this tutorial, we will focus on leading issues in the use of tree adjunction and tree-adjoining grammars for computational
linguistic applications. After reviewing the basic concepts of TAGs and some standard grammatical analyses making use of the
mechanisms, the tutorial will focus on the following issues of currency in the TAG research community (and on the associated
formalisms and methods): (1) lexicalization of TAGS (lexicalized TAGs); (2) mechanisms for specifying grammatical
constraints (adjoining constraints and feature-based TAGs); (3) relation between syntactic and semantic structure (synchronous
TAGs); (4) statistical modeling with TAGs (stochastic TAGs); (5) TAG parsing algorithms. We will describe how these issues
bear on several computational applications of TAGs, including: grammatical analysis, semantic interpretation, tactical generation,
machine translation, and statistical language modeling.
Very Large Text Corpora: What You Can Do with Them, and How to Do It
Mark Liberman and Mitch Marcus, University of Pennsylvania
This tutorial aims to give researchers who are interested in working with large text corpora the information and the
resources they need to get started. We will discuss: (1) what corpora are available, and how to get them; (2) practical, legal and
technical issues in getting new material; (3) availability of annotated corpora; (4) software for simple linguistic annotation of
unrestricted text — lemmatizers, taggers, parsers — what is available, and how to create your own; (5) how to do efficient
machine-aided annotation; (6) how to index and search large (annotated or plain) corpora efficiently; (7) examples of research
based on large corpora.
Discussion of the design and implementation of a sample of useful and available software will be featured. We will
provide a bibliography and a guide to available corpora and software.

Situation Semantics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966931230769231">
Keith Devlin, Colby College
Situation semantics is a mathematically-based semantics, grounded in situation theory. Introduced by Barwise and Perry in
the early 1980s, both situation theory and situation semantics have developed considerably since the appearance of their 1983
book Situations and Attitudes. The current &amp;quot;standard text&amp;quot; is my own book Logic and Information, published by Cambridge
University Press in 1991. The tutorial will be based on that reference.
I will begin with a brief overview of situation theory, explaining how it provides a framework for a general theory of
information. Although situation theory is a mathematical theory, it does not presuppose any substantial mathematical
prerequisites, though some mathematical sophistication enables a greater appreciation of various parts of the situation-theoretic
ontology. This will be followed by an introduction to situation semantics, covering the relational theory of word and sentence
meaning. Specific topics to be covered in addition to the basic framework are definite descriptions and conditionals. Time
permitting we will also look at how situation theory can be used to handle the way speaker and listener make use of social
knowledge in natural language interaction, and possible applications of situation theory to the design of interactive information
systems.

PREFACE TO THE STUDENT SESSION PAPERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986892391304348">
Once again, these proceedings conclude with the papers accepted for short presentations at the
student sessions of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. The student
sessions differ from the main conference in their emphasis on work in progress, judged on the basis of
insight, creativity and promise.
The first ACL student sessions were held in 1991 at the 29th ACL Meeting, under the stewardship of
Bonnie Lynn Webber and Philip Resnik. The stated goals were (1) to allow student members to hone
their presentation skills in a conference setting; (2) to provide student members with reactions to their
research from the community at large at a point where such reactions could make a significant difference;
and (3) to act as &amp;quot;ice breakers&amp;quot;, giving student members an opportunity to talk with each other and with
more senior researchers. The success of the 1991 sessions in meeting these goals provided the incentive
for again including student sessions in 1992.
The response to the call for papers was quite gratifying, eliciting 48 submissions (a 26% increase
over last year). Our thanks go to all the authors, and to the members of the Student Session Committee,
who participated in planning the session organization: Tilman Becker, University of Saarbruecken; Alan
Black, University of Edinburgh; Barbara Di Eugenio, University of Pennsylvania; Eric Iverson, New
Mexico State University; Lynn Lambert, University of Delaware; Karen Lochbaum, Harvard University;
and Cameron Shelley, University of Waterloo. The student sessions were made possible by the initiative
and support of the ACL Executive Committee and the 1992 Program and Local Arrangements
Committees. We would also like to thank Sandra Carberry, Philip Resnik, and especially Don Walker for
their advice and guidance thoughout the planning of the student sessions.
Our thanks also to the Student Session Program Committee. The thoroughness, helpfulness, and
expeditiousness of the reviewing were truly exemplary. The reviewing team included the Student Session
Committee members (above) as well as the following regular ACL members: Dan Fass, Simon Fraser

<note confidence="0.6822155">This volume contains the papers prepared for the 30th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, held 28 June-2 July in Newark, Delaware. Following on from last year&apos;s</note>
<abstract confidence="0.969844523809524">innovation, papers presented at the separate student session are also to be found, gathered in a separate section at the end of this Proceedings. In keeping with the prestigious nature of the meeting, and despite a number of alternative conferences in our area, the programme committee was once again confronted with a large number of very high quality submissions from around the world. Balancing our desire to accept as many as possible of those which merited inclusion with the need to present a conference programme which ordinary mortals could reasonably be expected to benefit from proved, as always, a difficult challenge. We hope the results, as represented by the conference itself and the papers collected here, will stand as a fair and representative cross-section of the best work in the field today. Many people contributed to the success of this year&apos;s meeting, and I&apos;m happy to have the opportunity of recording our thanks to them: to Martin Kay, Karen Sparck Jones and Don Walker, for the invited talks; to Bonnie Webber, for organising the excellent set of tutorial sessions; to Keith Devlin, William Gale, Joseph Kruskal, Mark Liberman, Mitch Marcus, Yves Schabes and Stuart Shieber for presenting the tutorials; to Sandra Carberry, Dan Chester and Kathleen McCoy, for handling the local arrangements; to David Traum and Lenhard Schubert for organising the Student Sessions; and finally to Don Walker and Betty Walker for their stalwart labours behind the scenes. In a year when over seven hundred papers in the field were submitted for consideration by a number of meetings, reviewers&apos; time and effort was at a premium, with many people being asked to read papers for several different meetings. My special thanks therefore to the programme committee members who read and diligently commented on large numbers of submissions, did so to a very tight timetable, and then participated in the traditional pressure cooker face-to-face programme committee meeting: Peter</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.994334636363637">As linguistic corpora get larger, computational linguists are turning increasingly to statistical techniques. This tutorial focusses on statistical techniques that have been useful in linguistic research, being careful to avoid those that have not been. For each method we review its strengths and weaknesses, and the conditions under which it it may or may not be used. The tutorial provides references to statistical texts, but does NOT include mathematical derivations. Graphical displays are used where possible to show the qualitative behavior of methods. The review starts with some very basic tools, such as methods for estimating the frequency of a token (word or n-gram), especially in the important but subtle case when the token has not occurred in the training sample. We emphasize the sometimes underappreciated importance of uncertainty (variability, standard deviation) of estimates. The foundations of the Bayesian approach to statistics are reviewed, because the approach has been found useful in such widely different contexts as author identification, information retrieval, and sense disambiguation. A general orientation to such broadly useful tools as clustering, factor analysis/principal components analysis, and multidimensional scaling is included.</abstract>
<affiliation confidence="0.6678805">Leading Issues in Tree Adjunction Schabes, of Pennsylvania Stuart Shieber, University</affiliation>
<abstract confidence="0.996506818181818">The use of an adjunction operation on elementary trees as the primitive operation of a grammar formalism was first proposed by Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi in the mid 1970&apos;s. Since then, a series of formalisms based on tree adjunction, under the name tree-adjoining grammars (TAG), have been defined and their properties explored. Certain attractive properties of treeadjoining grammars have led to their being proposed as solutions to a wide variety of natural-language-processing problems. In this tutorial, we will focus on leading issues in the use of tree adjunction and tree-adjoining grammars for computational linguistic applications. After reviewing the basic concepts of TAGs and some standard grammatical analyses making use of the mechanisms, the tutorial will focus on the following issues of currency in the TAG research community (and on the associated and methods): lexicalization of TAGS (lexicalized TAGs); (2) mechanisms for specifying grammatical constraints (adjoining constraints and feature-based TAGs); (3) relation between syntactic and semantic structure (synchronous TAGs); (4) statistical modeling with TAGs (stochastic TAGs); (5) TAG parsing algorithms. We will describe how these issues bear on several computational applications of TAGs, including: grammatical analysis, semantic interpretation, tactical generation, machine translation, and statistical language modeling. Very Large Text Corpora: What You Can Do with Them, and How to Do It Liberman and Mitch Marcus, of Pennsylvania This tutorial aims to give researchers who are interested in working with large text corpora the information and the resources they need to get started. We will discuss: (1) what corpora are available, and how to get them; (2) practical, legal and technical issues in getting new material; (3) availability of annotated corpora; (4) software for simple linguistic annotation of unrestricted text — lemmatizers, taggers, parsers — what is available, and how to create your own; (5) how to do efficient machine-aided annotation; (6) how to index and search large (annotated or plain) corpora efficiently; (7) examples of research based on large corpora. Discussion of the design and implementation of a sample of useful and available software will be featured. We will provide a bibliography and a guide to available corpora and software.</abstract>
<note confidence="0.835119444444444">Situation Semantics Devlin, College Situation semantics is a mathematically-based semantics, grounded in situation theory. Introduced by Barwise and Perry in the early 1980s, both situation theory and situation semantics have developed considerably since the appearance of their 1983 and Attitudes. current &amp;quot;standard text&amp;quot; is my own book and Information, by Cambridge University Press in 1991. The tutorial will be based on that reference. I will begin with a brief overview of situation theory, explaining how it provides a framework for a general theory of information. Although situation theory is a mathematical theory, it does not presuppose any substantial mathematical prerequisites, though some mathematical sophistication enables a greater appreciation of various parts of the situation-theoretic</note>
