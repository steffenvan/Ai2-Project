&amp;quot;We can lick gravity, but sometimes the paperwork is overwhelming.&amp;quot; These words
of the late Wernher von Braun, during the early months of the U.S. space program,
seem to translate to the area of natural language semantics rather nicely. Here&apos;s a thick
volume that shows that one can also lick several Herculean problems of semantics,
but only if one is willing to display the equivalent of Sisyphean labor. It reports work
by Hans Kamp and Uwe Reyle, who have been busy for the last thirteen years or so
grappling with such problems and finding clever answers.
If you are a semanticist you already know that anything Kamp writes matters.
Now that there is a book in which he appears as the principal author, I&apos;ll make the
sensible prediction that this two-part magnum opus will make history. It (and a se-
quel in the making; see below) will be consulted as an essential reference for years
to come, and will surely join the ranks of distinguished books such as Montague&apos;s
celebrated Formal Philosophy (1974), Dowty et al.&apos;s orderly presentation of Montague&apos;s
ideas (1981), Barwise and Perry&apos;s elegant Situations and Attitudes (1983), and Devlin&apos;s
lucid reworking (1991) of the latter.
And all this despite the fact that Kamp and Reyle wrote a textbook (a term used
here in a nonderogatory way)—one that includes exercises, painstaking historical anal-
yses, and that has a careful, top-down design for the classroom. The book is aimed at
students (researchers are also students!) with varying degrees of proficiency in seman-
tics; in fact, it even includes the material necessary for those who were never exposed

to semantics and formal logic. (Witness Kamp and Reyle&apos;s remark (p. 4): &amp;quot;[W]e ended
up writing a book without prerequisite.&amp;quot;)
From Discourse to Logic tells, in glittering composition, the story of Discourse Rep-
resentation Theory (DRT), a particular way of thinking about the semantics of natural
language. DRT owes its origins to Kamp&apos;s consistent efforts to solve two important
problems: (i) donkey anaphora, and (ii) tense and aspect. The first problem has to do
with sentences such as If Hitler owns some book, he burns it: the anaphoric connection
between some book and it is hard to justify in the light of the logical meaning of some.
The second problem, especially manifest in French, has to do with the difficulty of ex-
plaining the nuance between the passé simple and the imparfait—two morphologically
distinct past tenses.1
Kamp and Reyle trace the enigmatic nature of these problems to the static per-
spective that classical (model-theoretic) semantics provides. It is true that Montague&apos;s
vision (going back to Frege) to characterize linguistic expressions in terms of ref-
erential relations was a breakthrough of a very high order. However, questions of
anaphora and aspect require another dimension, the dimension of what is commonly
known as &apos;interpretation&apos;: the process by which a speaker assigns a meaning to the
strings of signs or sounds that she reads or hears. Kamp and Reyle&apos;s theory of mean-
ing attempts to use both the Montagovian outlook and the interpretive outlook in a
truly integrated fashion. Accordingly, DRT can be thought of as a remedy to the one-
sidedness of the classical paradigm by combining its truth-conditional perspective
with the interpretation-oriented world-view.
Here&apos;s a structural summary of the book:

Chapter 0 offers a very instructive (informal) discussion of fundamental ideas
about logic and semantics, and their natural relationships. It also defines a phrase
structure grammar (enriched with assorted syntactic features) that is used to explicitly
describe the details of DRT. The grammar is not all-encompassing but then again, it is
not a toy either. Chapters 1 and 2 give a formal, systematic presentation of the theory;
the core of these chapters is a famous paper of Kamp&apos;s (1981). Additionally, they
offer lengthy discussions on negation, and disjunction and conjunction, respectively.
Chapters 4 and 5 extend these into new realms, namely, plural constructions, and
tense and aspect, respectively. Chapter 3 serves as a bridge between Chapters 1 and 2,
and Chapters 4 and 5. It deals with reflexives, proper names, and scope ambiguity,
to name a few. Construction of Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs) are given
for plurals and tensed sentences in Chapters 4 and 5, together with detailed model

theories. In order to understand the essentials of DRT, Part 1 is probably sufficient;
however, to see DRT at work one should study Part 2 in detail. In fact, this is where
one can see the real power of DRT, as applied to realistic problems.
I must note that Kamp and Reyle intend to publish a sequel to the book under
review. This sequel will contain, among others, the following topics:

<listItem confidence="0.9998616">
• implications of DRT for certain issues in the philosophy of language and
philosophical logic
• the proof theory of the formal representations used by DRT
• the theory of propositional attitudes
• the theory of verbal communication, of mutual information, etc.

<bodyText confidence="0.999898208333333">
Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the reader to another excellent
book that complements the volume under review rather nicely. This is the thought-
provoking treatise of Asher (1993), which presents a novel approach and scrutinizes
the ways we refer to &apos;abstract objects&apos; (things like propositions, properties, states of af-
fairs, and facts) in natural language discourse. Asher devotes about 50 pages to a crash
course on DRT and then uses this framework to give a semantic analysis of eventual-
ity (an object that is either some kind of event or state) and abstract object-denoting
nominals in English.
Yogi Berra once said &amp;quot;95% of this game is half mental.&amp;quot; I think his remark also
applies to semantics. Traditionally, semantics has been conceived as a primarily philo-
sophical discipline with little to prescribe but much to analyze. However, Asher&apos;s
book is also important for the readers of this journal because of its due regard to
implementational aspects. The following excerpt (Asher 1993, p. 11) affirms this:
Finally, DRT is a major semantic framework for which implementation
has been a consistent goal. Careful attention to the DRS construction
process has yielded computational implementations of the theory rel-
atively easily, and fragments of the DRS construction algorithm now
run in LISP and PROLOG at a variety of sites in the US and Europe.
Go and read From Discourse to Logic and follow up with Asher&apos;s book. This will be
a demanding experience, but you won&apos;t regret it. In the end, you&apos;ll know a great deal
about one of the most original and influential semantic theories of our time (I think
the primary competition comes from Situation Semantics), and furthermore, you&apos;ll
encounter along the way many interesting problems with a strongly computational
flavor. In these days of the commonplace, who can ask for more?
