&amp;quot;[These] two volumes ... document the three
components of the CHILDES Project. [The
first] is divided into two parts that pro-
vide an introduction to the use of computa-
tional tools for studying language learning.
The first part is the CHAT manual, which
describes the conventions and principles of
CHAT transcription and recommends spe-
cific methods for data collection and digitiza-
tion. The second part is the CLAN manual,
which describes the uses of the editor, sonic
CHAT, and the various analytic commands.
The book will be useful for both novice and
experienced users of the CHILDES tools, as
well as instructions and students working
with transcripts of child language.
&amp;quot;The second volume of this set describes
in detail all of the corpora included in the
CHILDES database. The conversational inter-
actions in the corpora come from monolin-
gual children arid their caregivers and sib-
lings, as well as bilingual children, older
school-aged children, adult second-language
learners, children with various types of lan-
guage disabilities, and aphasics recovering
from language loss. The database includes
transcripts in 26 different languages.
