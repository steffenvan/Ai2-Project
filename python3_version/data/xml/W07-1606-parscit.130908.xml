In this work we report on the results of a
preliminary corpus study of Italian on the
semantics of temporal prepositions, which
is part of a wider project on the automatic
recognition of temporal relations. The cor-
pus data collected supports our hypothesis
that each temporal preposition can be asso-
ciated with one prototypical temporal rela-
tion, and that deviations from the prototype
can be explained as determined by the oc-
currence of different semantic patterns. The
motivation behind this approach is to im-
prove methods for temporal annotation of
texts for content based access to informa-
tion. The corpus study described in this pa-
per led to the development of a preliminary
set of heuristics for automatic annotation of
temporal relations in text/discourse.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999812172413793">
In this work we report on the preliminary results
of a corpus study, of contemporary Italian, on tem-
poral relations that hold between a temporal ad-
junct and an event as a way to determine the se-
mantics of temporal prepositions. We claim, fol-
lowing Schilder and Habel (2001), that the seman-
tics of temporal prepositions is rel (e, t), where rel
is used to indicate the temporal relation associated
with a certain preposition, t represents the meaning
of the Temporal Expression (timex), and e the
meaning of the event description involved.
Prepositions introducing a temporal adjunct are
explicit signals of temporal relations. The ability to
determine temporal relations between timexes in-
troduced by prepositions and events is fundamental
for several NLP tasks like Open-Domain Question-
Answering systems (Hartrumpf et al. 2006, and
Pustejovsky et al. 2002) and for Textual Entail-
ment and Reasoning.
The corpus data collected seems to support our
hypothesis that each temporal preposition can be
associated with one prototypical temporal relation,
and that deviations from the prototype can be ex-
plained as determined the occurrences of different
semantic pattern.
The work described in this paper is part of a lar-
ger project we are conducting on temporal dis-
course processing in Italian, as proposed in Mani
and Pustejovsky (2004).

This section presents a brief overview of the Ti-
meML specification language (Pustejovsky et al.
2005), which has been used as the starting point for
this work, and some theoretical issues on Italian
prepositions.

<bodyText confidence="0.999940888888889">
The TimeML specification language (Pustejovsky
et al. 2005) offers a guideline for annotation of
timexes, events and their relations. Like other an-
notation schemes1, TimeML keeps separated tem-
poral expressions and events, tagged, respectively,
with TIMEX3 and EVENT. In addition, two other
tags are used: SIGNAL and LINK.
The EVENT tag is used to annotate events, de-
fined as something which occur or happen, and

states, defined as situations in which something
holds true.
Temporal expressions, or timexes, like day times
(noon, the evening, 1p.m...), dates of different
granularity (yesterday, February 2 2007, last week,
last spring, last centuries...), durations (five hours,
in recent years...) and sets (twice a day...), are
annotated with the TIMEX3 tag. This tag is based
on specifications given by Ferro et al. (2001) and
Setzer (2001). Each timex is assigned to one of the
following types: DATE, for calendar times, TIME,
for times of the day, even if indefinites (e.g. ‘the
evening’), DURATION, for timexes expressing a
duration, and SET, for sets of times. Each timex is
further assigned a value, according to the ISO 8601
specifications (for instance, 3 anni ‘3 years’ is
normalized as “P3Y”, i.e. a “period of 3 years”).
Function words which explicitly signal a relation
between two elements (timex and event, timex and
timex, or event and event) are tagged with SIG-
NAL.
Finally, the LINK tag is used to specify the re-
lation between two entities. It may indicate a tem-
poral relation (TLINK), a subordinating relation
(SLINK) or an aspectual relation (ALINK). The
TLINK tag, which is pivotal for the present work,
comprises 15 relations, only 13 of which are purely
temporal. The 13 relations can be seen as derived
from Allen’s (1984) temporal logic, and 6 of them
are binary relations - one being the inverse of the
other. These relations (simultaneous, in-
cludes, is_included, during,
inv_during, begin, end, begun_by,
ended_by, before, after) make explicit the
temporal relation holding between two elements.

2.2 Temporal PPs in Italian
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943083333333">
Italian prepositions can be divided into two main
groups: monosyllabic like a, da, in, per, tra, -and
polysyllabic ones like fino a ‘up to’, dopo ‘after’,,
prima ‘before’...This difference at a surface level
reflects a difference also at a semantic level:
monosyllabic prepositions are either semantically
empty elements (i.e. when they are particles pre-
selected by the VP), or they bear a very abstract
relational meaning, which gets specialized on the
basis of the co-text; polysyllabic prepositions, on
the other hand, have a more specific meaning of
their own. For instance, the preposition dopo ‘af-
ter’ always means “subsequently, afterwards”, dis-
regarding its co-text; which makes the identifica-
tion of the relation between the elements involved
an easier task. In addition to this, most prepositions,
both polysyllabic and monosyllabic, belong to dif-
ferent semantic fields, e.g. spatial, temporal, man-
ner or other.
For the purpose of this work, any preposition
followed by a timex, as defined in TimeML (Sec-
tion 2.1), is considered a temporal preposition.
Consequently, we will speak of Temporal PP for
any sequence of the form “preposition + timex”.
In Italian, as in many other languages, the form
that Temporal PPs, or temporal adjuncts, may take
is influenced by the aspect and actionality of the
VP. In traditional grammars, for instance, it is
claimed that they can be introduced by in if the
lexical aspect denotes a telic event (e.g. (1)) and by
per if the lexical aspect denotes a process or a par-
ticular subclass of telic events, i.e. achievements
(e.g. (2)). Moreover, these kinds of Temporal PPs
necessarily refer to the conclusion of the process
denoted by the events and thus are incompatible
with the progressive aspect:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9842112">
1) a. Maria ha pulito la stanza in mezz’ora.
[Maria cleaned the room in half an hour]
b. La pizza arriva in cinque minuti.
[The pizza will arrive in five minutes]
2) a. Marco ha lavorato per due ore.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996295941176471">
[Marco has worked for two hours]
b. Marco mi prest˜ il libro per due giorni.
[Marco lend me his book for two days]
The influence of the aspect and actionality of the
VP has an impact also in the identification of their
meaning. In particular, in example 1) a. the prepo-
sition signals that the event of cleaning the room
lasted for half an hour, while in the example 1) b.
the event of arriving takes place after five minutes
from the utterance time. In example 1), thus, the
same Temporal PP, i.e. IN + timex, has two dif-
ferent meanings, signalled by the relations in-
cludes and after. The different temporal rela-
tions are determined by two different semantic pat-
terns: [DURATIVE_Verb] + in + [TIMEX type:
DURATION] for 1) a, and [TELIC_Verb] + in +
[TIMEX type: DURATION], for 1) b.

3 The corpus study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982777777778">
In order to verify our hypothesis that the most fre-
quent temporal relations represents the prototypical
meaning of a temporal preposition2, a corpus study
has been conducted. It is important to note that we
do not refer to frequency tout court, but is fre-
quency with respect to a certain semantic pattern.
Since we want to develop a system for automatic
annotation of temporal relations, a 5 million word
syntactically shallow parsed corpus of contempo-
rary Italian, drawn from the PAROLE corpus, has
been used3.
All occurrences of a prepositional chunk with
their left contexts has then been automatically ex-
tracted and imported into a database structure us-
ing a dedicated chunkanalyser tool4. This auto-
matically generated DB was then augmented with
ontological information from the SIMPLE Ontol-
ogy, by associating the head noun of each preposi-
tional chunk to its ontological type, and has been
queried in order to extract all instances of Tempo-
ral PPs, by restricting the nouns headed by preposi-
tions to the type “TIME”, which is defined in SIM-
PLE as “all nouns referring to temporal expres-
sions” (SIMPLE Deliverable 2.1: 245).
To identify the meaning of temporal preposi-
tions, therefore, we considered sequences of the
form:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.796726">
Fin Vb Chunk + Prep Chunk: semtype= TIME
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968495466666667">
where Fin Vb Chunk is a shallow syntactic con-
stituent headed by a finite verb and corresponds to
the “anchoring” event, and Prep Chunk is the
prepositional phrase that represents an instance of
a timex. To get a more complete picture of the dis-
tribution of Temporal PPs in text, we extracted
sequences from zero up to a maximum of two in-
tervening chunks, obtaining a set of about 14,000
such sequences.
A first observation is about the distribution of
the Temporal PPs. As illustrated in Table 1 (below)
Temporal PPs tend to occur immediately after the
event they are linked to.
2 We assume and extend Haspelmath’s (forth.) proposal on the
explanatory and predictive power of frequency of use.

3.1 Annotating Temporal Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981484846153846">
To identify the semantics of temporal prepositions,
a subcorpus of 1057 sequences of Fin Vb Chunk +
Prep Chunks (Time) was manually annotated by
one investigator with temporal relations in a bot-
tom-up approach.
The tags used for the temporal relation annota-
tion were taken from the TimeML TLINK values
(see Section 2.1). This will restrict the set of possi-
ble relations to a finite set. To ease the task, we
excluded the inverse relations for includes,
during, begin, and end. In order to understand
the role of the co-text, we also marked the types of
timexes according to the TimeML TIMEX3 tag
(ibid.). In this annotation experiment we did not
consider information from the VP because it will
be relevant to explain the deviations from the pro-
totype.
. To facilitate the assignment of the right temporal
relation, we have used paraphrase tests. All the
paraphrases used have the same scheme, based on
the formula rel (e, t), illustrated in the 3):
3) The event/state of X is R timex.
where X stands for the event identified by the Fin
Vb Chunk, R is the set of temporal relations and
timex is the temporal expression of the Temporal
PP. This means that the sequence in 4):

The relative low number of real Temporal PPs
can negatively influence the analysis and the iden-
tification of the semantics of the temporal preposi-
tions. In order to verify whether the data collected
could represent a solid and consistent baseline for
further analysis, we analysed all instances of false
positive timexes. With the exception of a few
cases, which could have been easily recognized by
means of a Timex Grammar, we found out that
482/608 instances are represented by nouns which
have some sort of temporal value but whose as-
signment to the semantic type “Time” in the On-
tology do not correspond to the given definition
(Section 3), e.g: colazione ‘breakfast’, scuola
‘school’, presidenza ‘presidency’, and many others.
Therefore, we performed a new extraction of
sequences excluding all instances of false positives.
The new results are very different since more than
56.03% of all prepositional chunks are Temporal
PPs. This provides support to the fact that the se-
quences extracted from the sub-corpus, though
small in number, can be considered as a consistent
starting point for identifying the semantics of tem-
poral prepositions. In particular, the prepositions
presented in Table 2 correspond to the most fre-
quent prepositions which give rise to temporal re-
lations between timexes and events. Though small,
the 449 sequences prove to be reliable: we have
identified a total of 320 temporal relations, as illus-
trated in Table 3:

5 Inferring Preposition Semantics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990538461538">
The analysis we propose for each single preposi-
tion provides information on its semantics. Such
information is obtained on the basis of the fre-
quency5 with which a given temporal relation is
associated or coded by that preposition. We claim,
as already stated, that temporal relations coded by
prepositions are signals of a certain semantic pat-
tern. Different temporal relations coded by the
same preposition signal different semantic pattern.
According to the frequency with which a temporal
relation, or a semantic pattern, occurs, it is consid-
ered either as the prototypical (i.e. most frequent)
meaning or as a deviation from the norm, whose

explanation relies in the analysis of the semantic
pattern in which it occurs. It is for this reason that a
major role in this analysis is played by the types of
timexes which follow the preposition. Keeping
track of their types, according to the TimeML clas-
sification (Section 2.1), is very useful mainly for
cases where the same temporal preposition codes
different temporal relations depending on the type
of the timex by which it is followed. In other
words, it is a way to assess the semantic pattern
which has been used to code that meaning. In the
following sections we will focus on the semantics
of the most frequent temporal prepositions, that is
in ‘in’, a ‘at, on’, per ‘for’6, da ‘for, since, from’.
Cases of low frequency temporal relations are not
analyzed here because they would require both
more data and a separate investigation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999744333333333">
These two prepositions, although they encode dif-
ferent temporal relations, are presented in a unique
subsection due to their extremely similar coherent
distribution across temporal relations. In particular,
the 80% (40/50) of per identifies a DURING tem-
poral relation, and 83.78% (31/37) of da identifies
a BEGIN temporal relation.
From these data, we can represent the semantics
of per as follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.999647333333333">
The preposition in is by far the most used temporal
preposition. In our corpus there are 91 occurrences
of this preposition, distributed as follows:

to a subset of uses of the English preposition “for” as in
the example:

Following our idea that the most frequent rela-
tion represents the prototypical meaning of the
preposition; we claim that Temporal PPs intro-
duced by in tend to code a relation of inclusion,
semantically represented as:

10) !(e, !(t, INCLUDES( e, t)).

<bodyText confidence="0.999976366666667">
Since this preposition is not exclusively used
with this meaning, the data forces us to provide an
explanation for the other relations identified, in
particular for DURING, AFTER and BEGIN.
Considering the DURING relation, we analyzed
the types of timexes governed by the preposition
but found that type distinctions did not help. Nev-
ertheless, we observed a clearcut regularity analys-
ing the normalized values of the timexes involved:
we found that, whenever the timexes are definite
quantified intervals of time (e.g. 2 days, 3 years,
half an hour) or temporally anchored instants, in
encodes the temporal relation of DURING, thus
deviating from the default interpretation repre-
sented in 10).
The relation AFTER shares with DURING the
restriction on the normalized values of the timexes.
However, for the AFTER relation there is a strong
contribution from the VP, as claimed in traditional
grammars. In such cases, it is the actionality of the
VP that forces the interpretation of in to express
the AFTER relation. In fact, this relation appears to
occur only with achievement verbs, which inher-
ently focus on the telos – or ending point (see ex-
ample 1) b Section 1).
Finally, the BEGIN relation can be found only
with aspectual verbs, e.g. iniziare ‘begin’ or
riprendere ‘resume’. In these cases the preposition
does not really work as a temporal preposition, but
more as a particle selected by the verb.

5.3 The Preposition a
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989742666666667">
The preposition a presents a non-trivial distribu-
tion, which makes it difficult to identify a proto-
typical value:

<bodyText confidence="0.999925083333333">
However, with NoLINK relations the preposi-
tion a does not have a temporal value, rather it is
used to express either quantities of time (and it
usually corresponds to “how many times an event
occurs or happens”) or it can be considered as a
particle selected by the VP. Therefore, if we ex-
clude the NoLINK relations, we can consider that
a Temporal PP introduced by a typically expresses
a relation of inclusion. Further support to this ob-
servation can be observed in the possibility of sub-
stituting a with in, at least in the temporal domain.
The semantics of the preposition is the following:

behaviour is the same as for the preposition in, i.e.
they are activated by aspectual verbs.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982828571428">
In this preliminary study we showed that preposi-
tions heading a Temporal PP can be associated
with one default temporal relation and that devia-
tions from the norm are due to co-textual influ-
ences. The prototypical semantics of temporal
prepositions can be represented as in 8)-11).
We also showed that the normalized values of
timexes play a major role in the identification of
temporal preposition semantics, more than the bare
identification of their types. Instances of deviations
from the prototypical meaning which could not be
explained by differences in the timexes forced us
to analyse the VPs, thus providing useful informa-
tion for the definition of the heuristics.
An important result of this work is the definition
of a preliminary set of heuristics for automatic an-
notation of temporal relations in text/discourse.
Our study also suggests a possible refinement of
the SIMPLE Ontology aimed at its usability for
temporal relation identification; and it can be seen
as a starting point for the development of a Timex
Grammar.
In the next future we intend to implement this
set of heuristics with a machine learning algorithm
to evaluate their reliability. All wrongly annotated
relations could be used for the identification of the
relevant information to determine the contribution
of the VP.
Some issues are still open and need further re-
search, in particular it will be necessary to investi-
gate the role of some ‘complex’ Temporal PPs
(e.g. in questo momento ‘in this moment’, which
can be paraphrased as ‘now’), and how to extract
the meaning of Temporal PPs as suggested in
Schilder (2004).

<abstract confidence="0.999759894736842">In this work we report on the results of a preliminary corpus study of Italian on the semantics of temporal prepositions, which is part of a wider project on the automatic recognition of temporal relations. The corpus data collected supports our hypothesis that each temporal preposition can be associated with one prototypical temporal relation, and that deviations from the prototype can be explained as determined by the occurrence of different semantic patterns. The motivation behind this approach is to improve methods for temporal annotation of texts for content based access to information. The corpus study described in this paper led to the development of a preliminary set of heuristics for automatic annotation of temporal relations in text/discourse.</abstract>

Like other annotation schemes1, TimeML keeps separated temporal expressions and events, tagged, respectively, with TIMEX3 and EVENT. In addition, two other tags are used: SIGNAL and LINK. The EVENT tag is used to annotate events, defined as something which occur or happen, and 1 Filatova and Hovy (2001), Schilder and Habel (2001), Setzer (2001). 38 Proceedings of the 4th ACL-SIGSEM Workshop on Prepositions, pages 38–44, Prague, Czech Republic, June 2007. c�2007 Association for Computational Linguistics states, defined as situations in which something holds true. Temporal expressions, or timexes, like day times (noon, the evening, 1p.m...), dates of different granularity (yesterday, February 2 2007, last week, last spring, last centuries...), durations (five hours, in recent years...) and sets (twice a day...), are annotated with the TIMEX3 tag.
