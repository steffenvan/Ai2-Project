This title in the ACL-sponsored &amp;quot;Studies in Natural
Language Processing&amp;quot; series is a collection of seven-
teen papers on Machine Translation (MT). Twelve of
the papers are revised versions of presentations at the
1985 Colgate conference, and four of the papers are
completely original. The appearance of this book is
further evidence of the massive renaissance of MT,
along with which comes the serious risk of surfeit of
books and articles covering the same material. It is
important, therefore, that publications in this field have
something new to offer the experienced reader. Hap-
pily, this is the case with Nirenburg&apos;s collection, since
most of the papers either focus on theoretical and
experimental approaches to the problem, or else ad-
dress some of the less commonly considered aspects of
MT. Notable in this respect are Weischedel and Ram-
shaw&apos;s discussion of ill-formed input, McDonald on
generation, and Walker&apos;s description of tools for ex-
tracting information from large databases.
Like the book itself, the remainder of this review is
divided into six parts, as reflected in the section titles.
1. The state of the art
The editor&apos;s introduction is a rather heterogeneous
collection of introductory thoughts. First, some of the
flavor of MT is presented through the discussion of the
types of knowledge involved in an MT system and the
ways in which problems can be addressed, notably by
restricting the input, or by involving the human in the
translation process. The final section of this chapter
gives a useful overview and summary of the remainder
of the book. Tucker&apos;s contribution is a revised version
of his 1984 ARIST article, and concerns strategies for
MT together with brief sections on sublanguage and
evaluation. Various MT systems are reviewed: these
are divided into the &amp;quot;operational&amp;quot; systems SYSTRAN,
SPANAM, TAUM-METEO, and METAL, and exper-
imental projects EUROTRA, Mu, SUSY, DLT, and
TRANSLATOR. Most of these will be familiar names,
except perhaps the last two: TRANSLATOR is Tucker
and Nirenburg&apos;s own system, while DLT is a project
under way in Utrecht, which envisages the use of
Esperanto as an interlingua. Tucker is justly critical of
this project, and one wonders why it merits two pages of
discussion when other more worthy systems are not
mentioned.

Raskin discusses the relationship between linguistics
and NLP. He begins with a catalog of the various
elements of linguistics and gives examples of problems
in each domain which are relevant to NLP. He says that
linguistic treatments are never complete; furthermore,
they are rarely available in a coherent form acceptable
for immediate implementation. Therefore, NLP pro-
jects must have linguists on their staff who know about,
and can gain access to, linguistic materials. But theo-
retical linguistic work is not always useful for NLP, as
we are shown (pp. 52-3) in an interesting point-by-point
analysis of the different needs of theoretical linguistics
and NLP.
Kittredge&apos;s excellent contribution is on the signifi-
cance of sublanguage for MT. &amp;quot;Sublanguage&amp;quot; is defined
informally as a linguistic system used in a particular
domain of discourse, and is characterized by specific
recurring structures and vocabulary. Although a sub-
language is a proper subset of some natural language, it
will not necessarily be a subset of the general variety of
that language. For example, the English of weather
bulletins (as in METEO) has sentence patterns which
are not generally found in standard English (e.g., omit-
ted articles and lack of tensed verbs):
In a sublanguage, the rules for constructing sen-
tences may be quite different from (and even con-
trary to) the rules for sentences in the &apos;standard&apos;
language. (p. 63)
The main attraction of a given sublanguage for the
purposes of MT is the extent to which it can be
described by a significantly smaller grammar than that
required for the full general language, and the extent to
which lexical ambiguities are reduced by the exclusion
of non-domain-relevant alternatives. Some sublan-
guages are not so &amp;quot;well-behaved&amp;quot; in this respect,
permitting &amp;quot;seepage&amp;quot; from general language (p. 63).
Kittredge next considers the choice of sublanguages
as suitable candidates for MT, noting that not all
sublanguages are necessarily good in this respect. This
was the experience of the TAUM-AVIATION project,
where some of the characteristics of the aircraft hydrau-
lics manual sublanguage were particularly unsuitable for
MT (e.g., complex NPs). Finally, he offers some guides
to estimating the suitability of candidate sublanguages
for MT. These include comparing vocabulary size in
texts of different lengths: a vocabulary growth curve
which tends to flatten is a good indicator of a con-
strained vocabulary. Estimating the computational trac-
tability of the grammar is more difficult. Kittredge gives

The first of five contributions in this section concentrat-
ing on specific approaches to MT is from Carbonell and
Tomita. This paper, titled &amp;quot;Knowledge-based machine
translation, the CMU approach&amp;quot;, is in two distinct
halves, the first (and longer) of which is essentially an
overview of existing approaches to MT (interactive,
pre-editing and post-editing). Considering the extent to
which it covers somewhat basic material, it is rather too
long, though the accompanying pictures might usefully
be transferred to overhead projector slides for use in
introductory lectures that many of us have to give from
time to time. Nevertheless, in the midst of this is a
section on &amp;quot;the knowledge-based approach&amp;quot; (KBMT)
(p. 75) which invites a number of comments. In this
approach, translation is achieved via a &amp;quot;language-free
meaning representation&amp;quot;; it is a pity that the authors do
not address some of the more obvious drawbacks to the
&amp;quot;interlingua&amp;quot; approach, to counterbalance some of the
perhaps controversial remarks made about the transfer
approach. For example, citing two papers from Coling
1976, they state that
A transfer grammar . . . is a large, amorphous, ad
hoc set of rules, referencing specific lexical entries,
that map phrases in one language into corresponding
phrases in another language. Thus, a complete trans-
fer grammar needs to be created for each pair of
languages—over 5,000 gargantuan grammars to
translate between the 72 most active languages.
(P. 75)
To be sure, a transfer grammar &amp;quot;may&amp;quot; be large, amor-
phous, and ad hoc, but must it necessarily be so? That
the grammar should reference &amp;quot;specific lexical entries&amp;quot;
cannot be held against it (cf. LFG, which is later cited
approvingly). And one wonders where the figure of 72
for the &amp;quot;most active languages&amp;quot; comes from. The
authors may also be being a little naive (or controver-
sial) in claiming generation to be &amp;quot;the simpler, less
computationally demanding process&amp;quot;, and in claiming
that the interlingual approach
. . . reduc[es] significantly the amount of develop-
ment work required to reach eventual closure in the
number of grammars needed to translate among all
commonly spoken languages. (p. 75)
Returning to slightly less controversial terrain, the first
half of this paper continues with a discussion of inter-
active systems. The authors do make the important
point that in interactive MT systems, the nature and
frequency of interactions must be carefully controlled,
and the mechanism of interaction must be at least a little
bit &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; (p. 78). The first half of the paper ends
with a proposal for an interactive system which by-
passes source text via a system of &amp;quot;automated text
composition&amp;quot; for highly stereotyped text types. To this
reviewer&apos;s knowledge, in fact, this type of template-
based production of &amp;quot;translations&amp;quot; is indeed used in
translation agencies where there is a frequent need to
translate similar texts (e.g., birth certificates, driver&apos;s
licenses). I
The translated pro-forma is stored on a disk, and the
ndividual details entered in response to prompts which
ie translator can preset. The &amp;quot;translations&amp;quot; can there-
after be produced by clerical staff. Although of com-
mercial interest, this approach probably does not rep-
resent an important theoretical or methodological issue.
The second half of the paper concentrates on KBMT
.,ystem design at Carnegie Mellon. A frame-like &amp;quot;entity-
-iented grammar formalism&amp;quot; is used to express do-
Riain-specific syntactic and semantic information, while
domain-independent syntactic information is expressed
in functional grammar formalism, the main advantages
of which are its reversibility (i.e., the same grammar can
be used for parsing and generation) and its familiarity
for computational linguists. A problem with these for-
malisms, say the authors, is implementation ineffi-
ciency. They hope to combat this by grammar pre-
compilation and efficient on-line parsing, using
Tomita&apos;s very fast parsing algorithm (Tomita 1986).
The next paper in this section is Nirenburg, Raskin,
and Tucker&apos;s description of their interlingual TRANS-
LATOR system. Whatever one&apos;s views on the plausi-
bility on interlingua-based MT, one should admire this
chapter at least for its attempt at some rigor in defining
an interlingua (IL), and also its bold answers, in its
concluding section, to some often recurring questions.
The TRANSLATOR system is composed of three mod-
ules: source language analysis into IL, IL &amp;quot;augmen-
tation&amp;quot;, and synthesis of the target text. This augmen-
tation consists of expansion of the essentially text-based
IL taking into account possible inferences, anaphora,
and discourse structure, using knowledge found in the
IL dictionary and grammar. The main body of this paper
is concerned with explaining and defining the IL dictio-
nary and grammar. The &amp;quot;IL dictionary&amp;quot; contains de-
scriptions of the types of entities that are used, which
are of two kinds: concepts and properties. Among the
types of possible properties are links to other IL dictio-
nary entries, which give the dictionary its hierarchical
organization. The most important of these links is via
the &amp;quot;isa&amp;quot; property, with associated inheritance mecha-
nisms, and generalization possibilities in inferencing. As
the authors freely admit, this is all very familiar. The
next few pages give some examples of dictionary en-
tries.
The IL grammar is a definition of the syntax of an IL
&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;. An IL text is a network of frames, intercon-
nected by discourse markers. The slots of the frames
may themselves contain frames, as well as speech-act

and focus information. Some examples are given,
among them some interesting alternative input texts
which represent the same proposition but with differing
focus (p. 103).
The next section briefly discusses the relationship
between source texts and IL representations. Here
there are some rather worrying statements which seem
to imply close correspondence between source language
syntactic categories and IL elements; e.g., a noun
corresponds to an object frame, a verb to an action or
state frame, and so on (p. 104). It is this reviewer&apos;s
belief (Somers 1987) that a major factor in favor of an
interlingual approach is precisely the extent to which it
permits syntactic category differences to be neutralized:
the noun victory no more represents an object than does
the verb win, for example.
The paper ends with an interesting set of typical
questions and the authors&apos; responses. Most readers will
find the viewpoints expressed here interesting and pro-
vocative, and may care to think what their own answers
would have been. The next paper, by Arnold and des
Tombe, concerns the European Commission&apos;s MT proj-
ect EUROTRA, and, in particular, its basic linguistic
methodology. The paper gives a good overview of the
underlying ideas, but the uninitiated may find the ter-
minology confusing, and the rather simplistic exempli-
fication misleading. It is unfortunate the terminology
adopted by EUROTRA can only serve to confuse the
reader: both &amp;quot;translation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;language&amp;quot; are given
special meanings, though they also appear sometimes in
their everyday usages—on one occasion within the
space of two lines! Some other criticisms should be
made: at one point, some terminology is introduced
without explanation or justification (&amp;quot;A-type rules&amp;quot;),
and one of the examples has a perhaps important
misprint (missing atom for &amp;quot;the-council&amp;quot; in (18) on p.
128). Also, the discussion of important questions like
the treatment of ambiguity in this framework is re-
stricted to the most simple of examples. On the positive
side, however, careful reading of this article will pro-
vide some real insight into at least the basic theoretical
methodology of the project (which is, after all, the
theme of the whole collection), and readers who find the
linguistic approaches exemplified rather naive should
understand that these are all subject to ongoing research
which, the authors claim, is facilitated by the &amp;quot;very
orderly environment&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;high degree of modu-
larity&amp;quot; that the approach provides (p. 134).
The next two papers both concern the basic design of
interactive MT systems. The contribution of Johnson
and Whitelock centers around the idea that current MT
systems do not distribute the task of translation be-
tween human and computer in an appropriate manner.
They propose a translation expert system where the
user&apos;s and system&apos;s skills complement rather than over-
lap each other. In particular, the system should be more
like a human translator in that it be permitted, if not
expected, to compensate for gaps in its knowledge
concerning source language and subject area (real
world) by consulting other experts, but not in its target-
language and contrastive knowledge. The contribution
is a well-argued &amp;quot;position paper&amp;quot;, but readers may be
disappointed in not finding more tangible details of the
experimental English-Japanese system based on these
principles, as compared to the previous articles.
Alan Melby&apos;s contribution is on much the same
theme. He describes a three-level &amp;quot;translator&apos;s work-
station&amp;quot;, where different degrees of human or machine
involvement are concerned. Melby defines four types of
human interaction in the MT process: the usual pre- and
post-editing, the former of which may be computer-
assisted in the manner of spelling and grammar checkers
now quite widely available. To these he adds &amp;quot;intra-
processing&amp;quot;, which is the familiar interaction during
translation—e.g., for the choice of target lexical item—
and &amp;quot;para-processing&amp;quot;, by which is meant tasks such as
the production of text-oriented glossaries, concor-
dances, and other such items which are sometimes
useful especially for large-scale translations. Para-proc-
essing also includes consultation of term banks.
Melby&apos;s translator&apos;s workstation design has three
levels. The first of these is chiefly a level of para-
processing, with word-processing, on-demand dictio-
nary look-up, telecommunications facilities (for consult-
ing with clients, colleagues, etc.), and so on. The
second level involves automatic dictionary look-up,
plus morphological analysis. The third level is &amp;quot;full&amp;quot;
MT, with the possibility of pre- and post-editing and
intra-processing, all packaged together in a flexible and
efficient way. Melby concludes by reminding the reader
that there are different types of MT for different user
needs, ranging from &amp;quot;indicative translation&amp;quot;, for which
the output from a fully automatic system may be
suitable, down to legal and literary translation, for
which perhaps the only suitable level of operation is the
first.
4. MT and AI
This section contains three papers on topics not often
addressed with MT in mind. They are, however, impor-
tant and relevant areas, which, as the editor points out
in his introduction (p. 18), even if not now being faced
must be tackled before long.
The first is the question of ill-formed input, discussed
by Weischedel and Ramshaw. To be fair, it must be said
that although this paper is very interesting, the rele-
vance to MT is not brought out as it might have been:
indeed, MT is only mentioned once; a significant part of
the chapter is given over to an example of the need to
infer speakers&apos; goals when interpreting interaction with
a database (it is not obvious that there is a major need
for such processing in MT); and there is no discussion of
the varying needs for robustness in different types of
MT system (cf. Arnold and Johnson 1984). On the other
hand, much of the paper concerns different sources of
ill-formedness, and notes that for each type different

solutions may be appropriate. The relevance here for
MT does not need stating.
The authors first make a distinction between &amp;quot;ab-
solute&amp;quot; ill-formedness, such as misspellings, homonym
confusion, omission, ungrammaticality, selection re-
striction violation and presupposition violation, and
what they call &amp;quot;relative&amp;quot; ill-formedness, i.e., input
which a human would judge well-formed, but which is
ill-formed with respect to the system&apos;s capabilities.
Unknown words and constructions which we might call
&amp;quot;extra-grammatical&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;ungrammatical&amp;quot;
would be examples of relatively ill-formed input.
Ill-formed input and its corresponding treatment can
be further subclassified according to the traditional
linguistic divisions of &amp;quot;phonetics&amp;quot;, morphology, syn-
tax, semantics, and pragmatics. Phonetic (or in texts,
orthographic) errors are misspellings and other typo-
graphical errors. According to the authors, these are
often corrected in practise by random permutation of
the letters, though as they point out, such errors are
rarely in themselves random. Certain misspellings are
common, but it might have been pointed out that many
errors are due to hitting adjacent keys, and so could be
interpreted given knowledge of the layout of the key-
board. Morphological and syntactic ill-formedness can
sometimes be identified, though this is particularly
difficult in English, with its impoverished morphology
and very flexible system of word classes. The semantic
interpretation of an unknown word—a frequent source
of relative ill-formedness—can sometimes be inferred
by a system, on the basis of its domain knowledge.
Finally, the use of pragmatic knowledge to interpret
ill-formed input is exemplified. As mentioned above,
this takes the form of goal and plan prediction, the
usefulness of which for MT must be questioned. How-
ever, all in all the article holds some useful new ideas
that MT researchers would do well to keep in mind.
The next paper, Pustejovsky on discourse analysis,
suffers even more than the preceding one from a lack of
overt reference to MT. To be sure, it is an interesting
overview of work on discourse analysis, plus a descrip-
tion of the author&apos;s own approach, but MT as such is
not mentioned even once! Most MT researchers recog-
nize that eventually MT systems will have to take
&amp;quot;discourse&amp;quot; into account, but in MT circles this is
usually understood as the need to resolve problems of
pronoun and other anaphoric references, disambigua-
tion, and (thinking about generation) pronoun insertion.
Pustejovsky does not mention these elements, however:
his article is essentially about the need to maintain a
model of discourse in order to make correct choices of
focus in generation. Irrespective of the quality of the
content of this chapter, it must be said that its inclusion
in a collection of papers on MT is of dubious benefit
both to MT researchers, and to colleagues in discourse
analysis, who will probably not read it.
McDonald&apos;s chapter on generation at least makes
more explicit reference to MT. He notes that generation
programs used in state-of-the-art MT systems are very
old-fashioned, and result in texts having an &amp;quot;awkward,
mechanical style&amp;quot; (p. 192). The author gives a good
overview of past, present, and future techniques in
generation, including his own, in some detail, and this
chapter will give MT researchers a good reminder that
the effort put into developing the generation part of an
MT system should at least approach the corresponding
effort on the analysis side.
Generation in the context of MT is significantly
different from generation in its more usual setting of NL
interfaces, but, in either case, it requires an element of
&amp;quot;planning&amp;quot;, viz, the realization of goals in the presence
of certain constraints. So a generation module should
(a) identify the goals the utterance (read &amp;quot;target text&amp;quot;)
is to achieve, (b) plan the achievement of these goals,
and (c) realize the plans. The old-fashioned method of
generation, employed in MT and elsewhere, is called
&amp;quot;direct replacement&amp;quot;, and involves synthesizing text
more or less directly from some representation (in the
case of MT, the output of analysis/transfer). However
&amp;quot;deep&amp;quot; or sophisticated this representation may be,
deficiencies include the lack of an &amp;quot;internal&amp;quot; (genera-
tion-oriented) grammar, as well as the fact—not
stressed by McDonald—that in the case of MT, the
representation generally reflects the structure (whether
syntactic, logico-semantic, or topic-comment) of the
source text.
Turning to some current alternatives, McDonald
briefly describes approaches to generation using ATNs,
systemic grammar, or functional unification grammars,
and then discusses his own &amp;quot;multi-level description-
directed&amp;quot; approach. Here there is a three-level ap-
proach to generation: the message to be generated is
converted to a syntactic representation prior to word-
stream realization. Although this does not sound partic-
ularly innovative, the important point is that various
decisions regarding generation can be made at different
levels, and each might influence or determine some
other choice. For example, choice of focus might be
made at the deepest level, and this in turn may condition
a grammatical choice at the syntactic level and a lexical
choice at the realization level. Ordering choices (at the
&amp;quot;message&amp;quot; level) may help determine pronominaliza-
tion and other anaphoric devices at the syntactic level,
and so on. As a final comment, McDonald stresses
again the MT angle: noting that modern approaches to
generation require information about rhetorical and
conceptual perspectives, he suggests that output quality
may be improved if the parsers are made sensitive to
these concerns, i.e., whether information is new, sa-
lient, conventional, etc.
&amp;quot;When parsers can notice these perspectives in
source texts and associate them with the generation
decisions that could have led to them, then we can
expect that MT output should be able to be every bit
as good as any text produced from an interface.&amp;quot;

5. Research tools for MT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99971140625">
In the first of two papers in this section, John White
describes the research environment of the METAL
project. Although White gives details at rather too low
a level, the careful reader can nevertheless pick out
several points of interest. White makes the traditional
point about the segregation of grammar formalisms and
parser software, though the use in METAL of a &amp;quot;high-
er-level Lisp dialect&amp;quot; (p. 226) for the former somewhat
compromises this distinction. The author underlines the
advantages of developing tools within an established
framework—in this case that of a Lisp machine (cf.
McNaught (1986) on the use of Unix), the need to use
real texts for testing, and the need for a variety of tools,
especially for lexicon development, to reflect different
types of users (cf. Boitet 1986).
Don Walker&apos;s contribution describes two knowledge
resource tools based on a massive collection of machine
readable databases including both linguistic and ency-
clopedic data. The first tool, called FORCE4, is used to
identify text subject matter. Walker describes clearly
how it works, and discusses honestly its limitations. Its
application to MT is obvious, though one of its weak-
nesses is the absence of proper names in the lexical
database which it uses. This problem may be attacked
by the second tool, called THOTH, which displays on-
screen information coded from various encyclopedic
resources. Of the two tools discussed, the first seems to
be of more practical interest to MT researchers, but in
both cases it is interesting to see the first steps being
taken towards implementing some sort of repository of
that elusive &amp;quot;real-world knowledge&amp;quot; we read so much
about.

The first of three descriptions of experimental MT
systems is by Makoto Nagao. His main point is that the
structure-preserving approach seen in systems translat-
ing between European languages is inappropriate for a
language pair like Japanese-English. I would disagree
with Nagao only insofar as he hints that this approach is
reasonable for closely related languages; in my view,
Nagao&apos;s approach, in which significant structural trans-
formations must take place at the transfer stage, is more
widely applicable. Unfortunately, the paper mostly con-
sists simply of examples of these transformations, and
although they will be of interest to readers familiar with
Japanese, especially the suggestions (p. 273ff) for treat-
ing structures with missing arguments, they look more
like ad hoc solutions to particular problem cases, rather
than examples of some underlying general motivation.
The second contribution, by Cullingford and Onysh-
kevych, is a detailed description of an experimental
&amp;quot;lexicon-driven&amp;quot; system. The main characteristic of
this is that the analysis is directed by a kind of produc-
tion system which builds a Conceptual-Dependency-
like representation using rules associated with the
words of the source text. The system translates—or
rather, as the authors make clear, &amp;quot;retell[s] or para-
phrase[sr—simple Ukrainian sentences into English.
The level of detail given is sufficient to get a good feel
for the system, but some interesting questions remain
unanswered. For example, in the face of well-docu-
mented practical experience over the last 20 years, it is
necessary to justify the assumptions that the authors
make regarding the feasibility of designing and using for
translation an interlingua &amp;quot;encoded in terms of a rela-
tively small number of primitive meaning units&amp;quot; (p. 279,
emphasis original). A good example is given a few pages
later, where the Ukrainian verb zmyty is shown as
having the two different readings &amp;quot;wash away&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;wash off&amp;quot;; surely the &amp;quot;ambiguity&amp;quot; is translational
rather than conceptual? (Ask a Ukrainian if the verb is
ambiguous.) Another point of interest would be to see
how the large amount of information given by the
&amp;quot;conceptual representation&amp;quot; for the example sentence
(p. 300) is pruned so as to produce the appropriate
translation, for this is perhaps the main argument
against the use of such representations for MT.
The final article, by Lytinen, describes an analyzer in
which syntax and semantics are integrated. The pro-
posal is quite an interesting one, in that it suggests a way
in which the combinatorial explosion of syntactic ambi-
guities can be controlled, and although its relevance to
MT is obvious, the article is really about parsing rather
than MT.
In conclusion, it should be noted that the collection
as a whole is not appropriate as an introductory text-
book, in that it contains mostly somewhat controversial
or ambitious ideas. I found it a little biased towards
interlingua-style MT, perhaps reflecting the editor&apos;s
view of what is the most pressing theoretical issue in
MT at the moment. I was a little sorry to see nothing
about the problems of implementing a large-scale MT
system, where some of the suggestions made in these
papers are really quite difficult to put into practice, but
all in all I found the book certainly interesting and
stimulating, and a worthy addition to the MT research-
er&apos;s bookshelf.

<abstract confidence="0.9892788">Language Processing&amp;quot; series is a collection of seventeen papers on Machine Translation (MT). Twelve of the papers are revised versions of presentations at the 1985 Colgate conference, and four of the papers are completely original. The appearance of this book is further evidence of the massive renaissance of MT, along with which comes the serious risk of surfeit of books and articles covering the same material. It is important, therefore, that publications in this field have something new to offer the experienced reader. Happily, this is the case with Nirenburg&apos;s collection, since most of the papers either focus on theoretical and experimental approaches to the problem, or else address some of the less commonly considered aspects of MT. Notable in this respect are Weischedel and Ramshaw&apos;s discussion of ill-formed input, McDonald on generation, and Walker&apos;s description of tools for extracting information from large databases. Like the book itself, the remainder of this review is divided into six parts, as reflected in the section titles.</abstract>

The first is the question of ill-formed input, discussed by Weischedel and Ramshaw. To be fair, it must be said that although this paper is very interesting, the relevance to MT is not brought out as it might have been: indeed, MT is only mentioned once; a significant part of the chapter is given over to an example of the need to infer speakers&apos; goals when interpreting interaction with a database (it is not obvious that there is a major need for such processing in MT); and there is no discussion of the varying needs for robustness in different types of MT system (cf. Arnold and Johnson 1984). On the other hand, much of the paper concerns different sources of ill-formedness, and notes that for each type different 58 Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 1, Winter 1988 Book Reviews Machine Translation: Theoretical and Methodological Issues solutions may be appropriate. The relevance here for MT does not need stating. The authors first make a distinction between &amp;quot;absolute&amp;quot; ill-formedness, such as misspellings, homonym confusion, omission, ungrammaticality, selection restriction violation and presupposition violation, and what they call &amp;quot;relative&amp;quot; ill-formedness, i.e., input w</context>

Some examples are given, among them some interesting alternative input texts which represent the same proposition but with differing focus (p. 103). The next section briefly discusses the relationship between source texts and IL representations. Here there are some rather worrying statements which seem to imply close correspondence between source language syntactic categories and IL elements; e.g., a noun corresponds to an object frame, a verb to an action or state frame, and so on (p. 104). It is this reviewer&apos;s belief (Somers 1987) that a major factor in favor of an interlingual approach is precisely the extent to which it permits syntactic category differences to be neutralized: the noun victory no more represents an object than does the verb win, for example. The paper ends with an interesting set of typical questions and the authors&apos; responses. Most readers will find the viewpoints expressed here interesting and provocative, and may care to think what their own answers would have been. The next paper, by Arnold and des Tombe, concerns the European Commission&apos;s MT project EUROTRA, and, in particular, its basic linguis</context>

A frame-like &amp;quot;entity-iented grammar formalism&amp;quot; is used to express doRiain-specific syntactic and semantic information, while domain-independent syntactic information is expressed in functional grammar formalism, the main advantages of which are its reversibility (i.e., the same grammar can be used for parsing and generation) and its familiarity for computational linguists. A problem with these formalisms, say the authors, is implementation inefficiency. They hope to combat this by grammar precompilation and efficient on-line parsing, using Tomita&apos;s very fast parsing algorithm (Tomita 1986). The next paper in this section is Nirenburg, Raskin, and Tucker&apos;s description of their interlingual TRANSLATOR system. Whatever one&apos;s views on the plausibility on interlingua-based MT, one should admire this chapter at least for its attempt at some rigor in defining an interlingua (IL), and also its bold answers, in its concluding section, to some often recurring questions. The TRANSLATOR system is composed of three modules: source language analysis into IL, IL &amp;quot;augmentation&amp;quot;, and synthesis of the target text. This augmentation consists of expansion of the essentially text-based IL taking in</context>
