This paper describes a compositional semantics
for temporal expressions as part of the meaning
representation language (MRL) of the JANUS system,
a natural language understanding and generation sys-
tem under joint development by BBN Laboratoires
and the Information Sciences Institute.1 The analysis
is based on a higher order intensional logic described
in detail in Hinrichs, Ayuso and Scha (1987). Tem-
poral expressions of English are translated into this
language as quantifiers over times which bind tem-
poral indices on predicates. The semantic evaluation
of time-dependent predicates is defined relative to a
set of discourse contexts, which, following Reichen-
bach (1947), include the parameters of speech time
and reference time. The resulting context-dependent
and multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expres-
sions solves a set of well-known problems that arise
when traditional systems of tense logic are applied to
natural language semantics. Based on the principle
of rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature of
the analysis provides a straightforward and well-
defined interface between the parsing component and
the semantic interpretation component of JANUS.

JANUS is a natural language understanding and
generation system which allows the user to interface
with several knowledge bases maintained by the US
NAVY. The knowledge bases contain, among other
things, information about the deployment schedules,
locations and readiness conditions of the ships in the
Pacific Fleet.

this information is highly time-dependent: Ships
change locations in accordance with their deployment
schedules, incur equipment failures or undergo per-
sonnel changes which can lead to changes in the
ship&apos;s readiness rating. It is, therefore, imperative that
at the level of semantic representation of the natural
language input an adequate analysis can be provided
for those linguistic expressions that carry time infor-
mation, for example, tenses, temporal adverbials and
temporal adjectives.

2 Applying Classical Tense Logic To
Natural Language Semantics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99974828">
My own treatment of temporal expressions is very
much a response to the kinds of analyses that have
been provided in classical tense logic. When I refer to
classical tense logic I mean the kinds of logics that
orginate in the work of the logician Arthur Prior (Prior
1967) and that have been applied by Montague
(Montague 1973) and others to natural language
semantics.
In classical tense logic time-dependency of infor-
mation enters into the definition of the notion of a
proposition. Propositions are defined as functions
from a set of times TI to the set of truth values true
and false. Declarative sentences of natural language
are taken to express propositions. The sentence It is
raining can be taken to be that proposition which
yields the value true for those times at which it is
raining and false for those at which it is not.
Tense operators can be defined in such a logic as
in (2) and (3). (2) defines a past operator capital P
which, applied to a proposition p, yields the value true
for some time t if the proposition p is true at some
time t&apos; prior to t. Likewise, (3) defines a Y operator,
where Y is mnemonic for yesterday, with the expected
truth conditions: Yp is true at t if p is true at some time
t&apos; that falls within the prior to the day in which t falls.

All of this sounds rather plausible. However, it turns
out that if one tries to apply tense operators such as P
and Y in natural language semantics, a set of well-

3 Inadequacies Of Classical Tense Logic

3.3 Tense and Quantified NP
3.1 Interaction of Tense and Time Adverbials
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994285714286">
The first such problem, which I pointed out in Hin-
richs (1981) and which has been independently noted
by Dowty (1982), concerns the interaction between
tense and time adverbials. If for sentence (4), one
interprets the past tense in (4) by the P operator and
the adverbial yesterday by the Y operator, then one of
the two operators has to have scope over the other.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999337">
(4) Vincent left yesterday.
(5) P [V [ leave&apos; (Vincent&apos;) ] ]
(6) Y [ P [ leave&apos; (Vincent&apos;) ] ]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959416666667">
However, neither the formula in (5), nor the one in (6)
gives adequate truth conditions for (4). In (5) the P
operator shifts the temporal evaluation of the proposi-
tion YlleaveyVincent91 from the speech time to some
past time t&apos; and then the Y operator shifts evaluation
to some time r within the day prior to t&apos;, instead of the
day prior to the speech time. (6) assigns wrong truth
conditions as well. Here the Y operator shifts evalua-
tion to some time within the day prior to the speech
time. But then the P operator in turn shift evaluation
to some time prior to that, but necessarily within the
same day.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999893">
3.2 Interaction of Tense and Negation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999768">
Similar problems arise when one uses standard
tense logic for sentences in which tense interacts with
sentence negation as in (7). As was first pointed out
by Partee (1973), one can assign the past tense
operator P either narrow scope with respect to nega-
tion as in (8) or wide scope as in (9).

<bodyText confidence="0.9998522">
However, neither the formula in (8), nor the one in (9)
assigns adequate truth conditions to (7). Formula (8)
says that there exists no time in the past at which the
proposition is true, clearly not capturing the meaning
of (7). (9) makes (7) true if at any time in the past
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.519877166666667">
3In fairness to Prior, it has to be pointed out that he designed his
temporal modal logics as purely formal systems and did not design
them with idea of applying them to natural language. However,
Priorean tense logic has, nonetheless, been applied to natural
language semantics. It is those studies that are subject to the
criticisms presented in sections 3.1 - 3.4
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919">
The third type of inadequacy of standard tense
logic has to do with the interaction of tense and quan-
tified NP&apos;s and was first pointed out by Enc (1981).
Enc points out that Priorean tense operators fail to
capture certain readings of sentences such as (10).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997765">
(10) Every admiral was (once) a cadet.
(11) V x [ admirar(x) P [ cadet&apos;(x)
(12) P [ V x [ admiral&apos;(x) cadet&apos;(x) 1]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998922428571429">
Since the past tense operator P is a propositional
operator. it can take scope over the consequent of the
material implication in (11). (11) represents the read-
ing that everyone who is an admiral now was a cadet
at some time in the past. The second reading in (12),
where P has scope over the entire formula assigns
the somewhat absurd truth conditions that at some
time in the past every admiral as simultaneously a
cadet. However, as Enc observes correctly, with
propositional tense operators one cannot obtain the
perfectly natural reading that everyone who is an ad-
miral now or who was an admiral at some time in the
past was a cadet at some time prior to being an ad-
miral.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98945">
3.4 Temporal Anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998725">
There is fourth problem that arises when one uses
tense operators of standard tense logic for the seman-
tic interpretation of single sentences or pieces of dis-
course that describe multiple events.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.832047">
(13) Vincent was hit by a harpoon, was aban-
doned by its crew, and sank.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999868142857143">
The most natural interpretation of (13) is one in which
the events are understood to have happened in the
same temporal order as they are sequenced in the
sentence. However, if one uses a Priorean P
operator to interpret each occurrence of the past
tense in (13), one arrives at an interpretation, which
incorrectly allows for any temporal ordering.

4 A Tense Logic with Multiple Indices
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99965775">
It turns out that most of the problems that I have
just discussed can be solved if one recognizes more
than one parameter of temporal evaluation. In the
models given to tense logics such as the ones first
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.978450289473684">
developed by Prior, one standardly evaluates proposi-
tions with respect to a single time which one may call
the event time, the time at which an event happens or
at which a state of affairs obtains. The point of
speech is taken to be a special case of this
parameter.
An alternative to models with only one temporal
parameter has been given by Reichenbach (1947).
Reichenbach argues for distinguishing between three
parameters which he calls speech time, event time
and reference time. The meaning of the first two
parameters should be self-explanatory. It is the third
parameter, reference time, that requires explanation.
Reichenbach conceives of reference time as the tem-
poral perspective from which an event is viewed, as
opposed to event time as the time at which the event
occurs. Reference time can be either implicit in the
discourse context or explicitly specified by temporal
adverbials such as yesterday. For each individual
tense reference time is temporally ordered with
respect to the other two parameters. Reference time
plays a crucial role in Reichenbach&apos;s account of the
distinction betwen the simple past and the present
perfect in English. In both cases event time preceeds
â€¢speech time. But while for the simple past, the event
time is viewed from a perspective in the past, the
event is viewed from the perspective of the present in
the case of the present perfect.
Given the distinction between reference time and
event time, one can then formalize Reichenbach&apos;s
analysis of the past tense as in (14). The operator P
shifts evaluation of the event time t to some time t&apos; in
the past such that t&apos; falls within some reference time r.
(14) [P p]r3 T if [p]rx for some time t&apos; such that
t&apos; &lt; t and t&apos; r.
The Y operator on the other hand, does not shift the
event time t, rather it operates on the reference time r
in the obvious way.3

(15) [Y p],,,t T iff fol
...[DAY(t.)-11,t = T.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998805">
With the redefined operators P and V. one can now
give adequate truth conditions for sentences involving
tense and time adverbials. In the formula in (16) Y
specifies the reference time r to be the day prior to the
speech time, and then the P operator locates the
event time as being within that reference time.

<equation confidence="0.74061525">

some t&apos; &lt; t and t&apos; [DAV(t)-1].
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.983255833333333">
Likewise for tense and negation, the past operator
locates the event time t prior to speech time and
within some reference time r which in the case of (17)
has to be taken to be contextually specified.
&apos;Operators similar to the redefined P and Y operators have first
been suggested in the literature by Acquist (1976).

(17) is true according to (18) if there is no time within
the reference time r at which the untensed proposition
leave&apos;( Vincent) is true.
It turns out that a multi-indexed tense logic also
gives an adequate account of tense in discourse. A
detailed account of this can be found in Hinrichs
(1981, 1986); here I will only sketch the basic idea:
By ordering event times with respect to reference
times, as sketched in (20), and by updating such ref-
erence times after each event description, one can
order multiple events as described in (19) in the ap-
propriate way. The relations &lt; and in (20) are
meant to stand for temporal precedence and temporal
inclusion, respectively.

The one in (22) I have already discussed. In (22) past
tense is translated into a propositional operator whose
semantics is implicit in the truth conditions imposed
with respect to the model-theory. .In the formula in
(23) the past tense leads to existential quantification
over times. The existential quantifier binds variables
which appear as extra argument positions on predi-
cates. So, ship&apos; which is ordinarily taken to be a
one-place predicates turns into a two-place predicate
that takes individuals and times as its arguments.
The variable tr occurs as a free variable in (23) and
stands for the Reichenbachean reference time.
Although the two formulas in (22) and (23) are
logically equivalent in the sense that both are true
under the same set of models, I will adopt the style of
logical representation in (23) for remainder of this
paper This is because in the context of the JANUS
system, it is important to explicitly quantify over times
since in the database times are explicitly entered as
dates, time stamps, etc. In order to be able to access
them, it is important to incorporate time information
explicitly at the level of logical form.
A second reason for preferring the style of
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999366">
representation in (23) over the one in (22) concerns
the interaction between tenses and quantified NP&apos;s.
Since formulas such as (23) explicitly quantify over
times, scope relations with respect to quantification
over individuals become completely transparent.

5 Tense and Quantified Noun Phrases
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995146">
Using the style of representation exemplified by
formula (23), let me then return to the issue of tense
and quantification, which is still unresolved. Consider
once again the types of examples that, as Enc points
out, cannot be handled in standard tense logic.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.953609">
(24) Every admiral was (once) a cadet.
(25) V x [ admiral&apos;(x) P [ cadet&apos;(x) ]]
(26) P (V x (admiral&apos;(x) cadet&apos;(x) ]]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.970582642857143">
If tense operators like P have scope over proposi-
tions, P can either scope over an entire formula as in
(25) or over the consequent of the material implication
as in (26). Now, as we saw earlier, neither formula
captures the reading that all present or past admirals
were cadets prior to their being admirals.
Enc (1981) provides an interesting solution to the
problem posed by examples such as (24). Her solu-
tion is based on two assumptions: 1. Semantically,
tenses should have scope only over verb meanings,
but not over any larger elements in a sentence, and 2.
verb meanings as well as noun meanings are indexi-
cal in the sense their interpretations depend on the
context of the utterance in the same way that
demonstrative pronouns such as that and anaphoric
pronouns such as she and they do.
As the formula in (27) shows, which represents
the translation for (24) in my analysis, I adopt Enc&apos;s
first assumption and assign tense scope only over the
main verb of the sentence.
(27) V x [ 3 t [ admiral&apos;(x)(t) &amp; R (x)(t) j
( 3 t&apos; (t&apos; &lt; ts &amp; t&apos; e tr &amp; graduate-from&apos;(West-
Point&apos;)(x)(t&apos;) ]]
The predicate R in (27), whose role I will comment on
in more detail shortly, is meant to range over
properties which are salient in a given context. The
past tense of sentence (24) contributes the existential
quantification over times t&apos; that precede the speech
point ts and are contained in some contextually
specified reference time tr. Following Enc, tense is
thus given scope only over the predicate that cor-
responds to the main verb. However, the formula in
(27) also shows that I do not follow Enc in her second
assumption, namely her treatment of nouns as indexi-
cals. In contrast to true indexicals, whose denotation
depends solely on the context of utterance, I treat the
denotation of predicates corresponding to nouns as
being time-dependent in an absolute sense, since
predicates such as admiral do carry a time-denoting
argument position as part of their function-argument
structure. Without such an argument, it seems impos-
sible to give a satisfactory account of temporal adjec-
tives such as former and previous or last, whose func-
tion it is to shift the temporal evaluation of the predi-
cate that they combine with. However, I do recognize
an element of context dependency inherent in the in-
terpretation of noun phrases such as every admiral,
since I interpret such noun phrases with respect to
some contextually salient property R. This predicate
makes it possible to account for the well-known
phenomenon of restricted quantification, namely that
in sentences such as (28) the interpretation of
everyone does not involve the set of all students in
the world, but rather the set of all individuals in a
given context; for example everyone at a certain
party.4
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.579955">
(28) Everyone is having a good time.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9098966">
Temporal evaluation of the verbal predicate is, thus,
kept separate from the temporal evaluation of predi-
cates corresponding to other constituents in the sen-
tence. As first pointed out by Enc, this strategy
makes it possible to account for sentences such as
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995524857142857">
(29) and (30) whose translations require that the
predicates secretary and fugitive be evaluated relative
to a time which is distinct from the evaluation time of
the predicate corresponding to the verb.5
(29) Oliver North&apos;s secretary testified before the
committee.
(30) Every fugitive is now in jail.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999600666666667">
In contrast to an analysis which interprets the past
tense in terms of a Priorean P operator, the narrow
scope analysis of tense also avoids the dilemma of
inducing a simultaneity reading for sentence (31), if
the tense operator P has scope over the entire for-
mula as in the translation (32) of (31).

<listItem confidence="0.951338333333333">

<bodyText confidence="0.999899">
The reading in (32) is factually implausible for two
reasons: 1. It imposes simultaneity as part of the truth
conditions and requires that all admirals graduated at
the same time, 2. since the P operator forces tem-
poral evaluation of all predicates in its scope at the
same index, in the case of (31) it requires that every
admiral graduated from West Point as an admiral, and
not, as is actually the case, subsequent to graduation
from the Naval academy.
Notice that the formula in (33) , which represents
the translation of (31) in my analysis, avoids both
problems associated with (32).

Since temporal evaluation of the predicates admiral&apos;
and graduate-from&apos; are kept separate, the first
problem does not arise. Since the predicates are
existentially quantified over independently, (33), in
contrast to (32), also avoids having to assign a simul-
taneity reading to (31).
A crucial element of my analysis is the inclusion of
the predicate R, which is meant to restrict the denota-
tion of quantified NP &apos;s such as every ship by
properties that are salient in the context of utterance.
Apart from keeping the temporal evaluation of verbal
predicates and nominal predicates independent of
one another, it is this context dependent feature of my
analysis that makes it more flexible than a wide scope
analysis of tense. Let me illustrate how the context-
dependent evaluation of quantified NP&apos;s by once
again focusing on example (34).
(34) Every admiral graduated from West Point.
Imagine that (34) is uttered in a context in which all
current admirals assigned to the Pacific Fleet are un-
der discussion. In that context, R could be instan-
tiated as in (35), i.e. as the intension of the set of
individuals x which are assigned to the Pacific Fleet at
a time which equals the speech time ts.
(35) kt ky [assigned-torac-Fleen(y)(t) &amp; t = ts]
Substituting R by (35) in (36), one then arrives at the
formula in (37).

In a context in which all present or past admirals in
the Pacific Fleet are under discussion, a reading

The idea behind using the variable R in my analysis
is, thus, to have it instantiated appropriately by the
discourse context. One of the counterarguments that
one may raise against this context-dependent aspect
of my analysis of temporal semantics concerns the
fact that tracking the salience of objects and their
properties in natural language discourse is a
notoriously difficult problem. However, I will argue in
the next section that whatever mechanisms are
needed to track saliency, such mechanisms are
motivated independently by semantic and pragmatic
phenomena that go beyond phenomenon of temporal
interpretation.

<bodyText confidence="0.9793375">
Objects and certain of their properties can receive
or maintain salience in a discourse in any number of
ways. The notions of focus (Sidner 1983), of common
ground (Stalnaker 1978) and of mutual knowledge
(Clark and Marshall 1981) are certainly cases in point.
In this section I will concentrate on one such
mechanism which plays a role in the context-
dependent interpretation of time dependent predi-
cates. I will argue that the mechanism is needed for
purposes other than temporal interpretation and,

temporal semantics.

The person asking (39b) is not interested in being
informed about all ships that at some time in the fu-
ture will go to Hawaii. Instead, the user is interested
in a much more restricted set of ships that will go
there, namely the ones that were deployed by some
admiral the day before. In order to arrive at such an
interpretation, the free variable R in the translation
formula in (40) has to be bound appropriately by the
context.

QUERY is a speech act operator which takes the
propositional content of the question as an argument
and causes to evaluate it at some temporal index, in
this case the point of speech ts. In (40) QUERY ap-
plies to a lambda-abstract over those sets of objects x
which are the speech time ts in the Indian Ocean and
whose members y at some time t have the property of
being a ship and which are in addition distinguished
by some contextually salient property R. POW stands
for the power set operation which I use for the inter-
petation of plural nouns. Now if the reader prefers
some other approach to the semantics of plurals, say
the lattice-theoretic approach of Link (1983), over the
approach based on power sets I am not going to ar-
gue with them. The point that I want to concentrate
on with respect to the formula in (40) concerns the
instantiation of the context-dependent predicate
R. The predicate ship&apos; has to be interpreted relative to
the discourse context, and the temporal evaluation of
the predicate is determined with respect to that con-
text, rather by the tense of the sentence, in this case
the future.
It turns out that a detailed proposal for how to
track objects and their properties does, in fact, already
exist in the literature. In her work on the interpretation

of pronouns in discourse, Webber (1978,1983) has
developed a framework that constructs during the in-
terpretation of a discourse a context which consists of
a set of what she calls discourse entities. These dis-
course entities then become available as objects that
pronouns can refer to. One of the examples that
Webber discusses is the interpretation of the pronoun
they in (42) in the context of sentence (41).

Clearly they refers to the set of ships deployed by
some admiral. What is interesting, of course, about
the example is that syntactically there is no plural
noun phrase in the preceding discourse that could
serve as the referent for the plural pronoun they.
In order to derive the appropriate discourse entity
for the interpretation of they. Webber suggests the
rule schema as in (43). (43) says that for any formula
that meets this structural description, a discourse en-
tity identified by this formula is to be constructed.
(43) SD: V 3 x [P -+ Q]
ID: x 3 y1.. .k [P a Q]

the rule produces the expression in (45).

(45) denotes the set of ships that have been deployed
by some admiral. This discourse entity with that
description then becomes available for the interpreta-
tion of the pronoun they.
It turns out that the method of constructing dis-
course entities is not only relevant for the interpreta-
tion of pronouns, but also for the contextual interpreta-
tion of nouns and noun phrases that I am concerned
with here.
The discourse entity with the description in (45)
cannot only serve for interpreting pronouns, but also
for instantiating the contextually specified variable R
for the interpretation of the noun ship in (46b) in the
context of (46a).

Since the discourse entity in (45), which ranges over a
set of ships, is described in terms of the property of
having been deployed by some admiral the day prior
to the day of the speech point, that property can be
taken to be salient in the discourse context. If one
substitutes the context variable R in the translation
(47) of (46b) by this contextually salient property, the
temporal evaluation of the predicate ship&apos; in the result-
ing formula (48) is no longer governed by the existen-
tial quantifier t for the future tense, but rather by the
quantifier t&apos; introduced by the contextually salient
property. As a consequence of this instantiation of
the context variable R, the sat of ships under con-
sideration is restricted in the appropriate way. which
are assumed to be bound by the discourse context.

Notice that (48) contains two reference time
parameters tr and t&apos;r, which are associated with quan-
tifiers ranging over past and future times, respectively.
I am assuming here that each tense has associated
reference time which is updated during discourse
processing.6
The mechanism for deriving contextually salient
properties which are introduced through the previous
linguistic discourse may strike the reader as rather
complicated in detail. However, as I have argued in
this section, tracking such properties is important not
only for temporal evaluation, but is independently
motivated by other discourse phenomena such as
anaphoric reference, as Webber (1978,1983) has
convincingly shown.

Semantics of Tense

<bodyText confidence="0.9283175">
In the previous sections I have focused on the
semantic and pragmatic aspects of my analysis of
temporal expressions, that concern in particular the
feature of narrow scope assignment of tense and the
feature of context-dependent interpretation of quan-
tified NP&apos;s. In this section I will concentrate on mat-
ters of syntax and will demonstrate how the narrow
scope analysis of tense makes it possible to construct
a straightforward compositional syntax and semantics
of temporal expressions.
Syntactically tenses in English appear as inflec-
tional morphemes on verbs. In the notation of
categorial grammar, I assign a syntactic tree as in
(50) to sentence (49). The untensed form of the verb
arrive of category IV is combined with the past tense
morpheme -ed to form a tensed intransitive verb IV&amp;quot;.
Morpho-syntactically, tenses are therefore items that
apply to individual words.
(49) Every ship arrived.

Since I assign tense narrow scope in the semantics
and let temporal quantifiers bind only the temporal
index associated with the main verb, I arrive at an
analysis of tense where its syntactic domain coincides
with its semantic domain. Compared to analyses in
which tense is assigned wide scope over formulas
which correspond to entire sentences (Montague
1973) or over entire verb phrases (Bach 1980), the
narrow scope analysis, which I have developed in this
paper, has the advantage of leading to a straightfor-
ward compositional syntax and semantics of tense. In
the syntax the tense morpheme turns an untensed
verb into its tensed counterpart, while in the cor-
responding translation rule tense has the effect of ex-
istentially quantifying over the time-index of the predi-
cate which translates the untensed verb.

al Si )...(Ss)(x)(r) I.
S17 is a rule schema which ranges over untensed
intransitive verbs (IV), transitive verbs (IV/NP), ditran-
sitive verbs (IV/NP/NP), etc. The notation IV/NP,
thus, stands for an IV followed by n slashed NP&apos;s.
The corresponding translation schema T17 denotes a
function from the type of meanings associated with
object NP&apos;s, if any, to functions from individuals to
truth values. Although these rule schemata are rather
technical, their meaning should become clearer, when
one considers a concrete example. Consider once
again the example (53) whose syntax has been given
in (50).
(53) Every ship arrived.
The translation of the entire sentence can be built up
in a compositional fashion as in (54), which mirrors
the syntactic composition of (50).

every ship translates as:

Every ship arrived translates as:

The phrase every ship is formed by supplying the
predicate ship&apos; as an argument to the translation of
every. Notice that the context-variable R is introduced
by the translation of the quantifier every. The trans-
lation of the entire sentence is formed by supplying
the translation of the tensed verb arrived, which is
produced by the translation T17, to the translation of
the subject NP. The reduced translation results from
two steps of lambda-reduction.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990746">
In this paper I have argued that a logical seman-
tics for temporal expressions can provide adequate
representations for natural language input to an inter-
face such as JANUS. The temporal logic is based on
Reichenbach&apos;s models for the semantics of English
tense and uses multiple indices for semantic inter-
pretation. This multi-indexed logic overcomes the
kinds of problems that arise when systems of tense
logics are used that rely on just one index of evalua-
tion.
I have demonstrated how giving narrow scope to
tense quantifiers enables us to provide adequate
scope relations with respect to NP quantifiers and to
interpret such NP&apos;s relative to a given discourse con-
text. I have argued that the context-dependent fea-
ture of the analysis does not add extra complexity to
my treatment of time-dependent expressions, but is
needed for purposes of discourse understanding in
general. Finally, I have demonstrated how the narrow
scope of tense results in a fully compositional syntax
and semantics of tensed sentences in English.

Temporal expressions of English are translated into this language as quantifiers over times which bind temporal indices on predicates. The semantic evaluation of time-dependent predicates is defined relative to a set of discourse contexts, which, following Reichenbach (1947), include the parameters of speech time and reference time. The resulting context-dependent and multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expressions solves a set of well-known problems that arise when traditional systems of tense logic are applied to natural language semantics. Based on the principle of rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature of the analysis provides a straightforward and welldefined interface between the parsing component and the semantic interpretation component of JANUS.</abstract>

(25) V x [ admiral&apos;(x) P [ cadet&apos;(x) ]] (26) P (V x (admiral&apos;(x) cadet&apos;(x) ]] If tense operators like P have scope over propositions, P can either scope over an entire formula as in (25) or over the consequent of the material implication as in (26). Now, as we saw earlier, neither formula captures the reading that all present or past admirals were cadets prior to their being admirals. Enc (1981) provides an interesting solution to the problem posed by examples such as (24). Her solution is based on two assumptions: 1. Semantically, tenses should have scope only over verb meanings, but not over any larger elements in a sentence, and 2. verb meanings as well as noun meanings are indexical in the sense their interpretations depend on the context of the utterance in the same way that demonstrative pronouns such as that and anaphoric pronouns such as she and they do. As the formula in (27) shows, which represents the translation for (24) in my analysis, I adopt Enc&apos;s first assumption and </context>

Temporal expressions of English are translated into this language as quantifiers over times which bind temporal indices on predicates. The semantic evaluation of time-dependent predicates is defined relative to a set of discourse contexts, which, following Reichenbach (1947), include the parameters of speech time and reference time. The resulting context-dependent and multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expressions solves a set of well-known problems that arise when traditional systems of tense logic are applied to natural language semantics. Based on the principle of rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature of the analysis provides a straightforward and welldefined interface between the parsing component and the semantic interpretation component of JANUS. 1 Introduction JANUS is a natural language understanding and generation system which allows t</context>

In the models given to tense logics such as the ones first 9 developed by Prior, one standardly evaluates propositions with respect to a single time which one may call the event time, the time at which an event happens or at which a state of affairs obtains. The point of speech is taken to be a special case of this parameter. An alternative to models with only one temporal parameter has been given by Reichenbach (1947). Reichenbach argues for distinguishing between three parameters which he calls speech time, event time and reference time. The meaning of the first two parameters should be self-explanatory. It is the third parameter, reference time, that requires explanation. Reichenbach conceives of reference time as the temporal perspective from which an event is viewed, as opposed to event time as the time at which the event occurs. Reference time can be either implicit in the discourse context or explicitly specified by temporal adverbials such as yesterday. For each individual tense reference time is te</context>
