This paper proposes an English adverb
ordering method based on adverb gram-
matical functions (subjuncts, adjuncts, dis-
juncts and conjuncts) and meanings (pro-
cess, space, time etc.), preferred positions
in sentences (initial, medial, end, pre,
post), and priorities between adverbs with
the same preferred position.

Adverbsi have various complex grammatical func-
tions in sentences but they do not construct the main
parts of sentence meaning. In natural language pro-
cessing, therefore, the study of adverbs has not de-
veloped very far to date.
Linguists have examined adverb grammatical
functions and meanings in detail (Quirk et al.,
1985) (Greenbaum, 1969). Our method is based on
these studies about adverb grammatical functions
and meanings. Other adverb studies by linguists in-
clude studies which handle the meanings of specific
adverbs, such as &amp;quot;even&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;still&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;already&amp;quot; and
temporal adverb studies which handle temporal se-
mantics in sentences.
The main problems in adverb processing in
Japanese to English machine translation (Ogura et
al., 1993) are as follows:

2 Classification of English Adverbs

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998674">
2.1 Position
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998061">
In our adverb position system for English adverb
generation, 5 positions are provided. The first is
initial position (IP), the beginning of the sentence.
The second is medial position (MP), between the
subject and predicate, or if auxiliary verbs are in-
volved in the sentence just after the first auxiliary
&apos;In this paper, adverbs include idiomatic adverbial
phrase, such as &amp;quot;on purpose&amp;quot;.
verb. The third is end position (EP), after a predi-
cate. Pre position (PreP) and post position (PostP)
are provided for adverbs as modifiers. A pre posi-
tion adverb comes before a modificant and a post
position adverb comes after a modificant.

2.2 Classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998355">
Adverbs can roughly be divided into subjuncts, ad-
juncts, disjuncts and conjuncts by their grammatical
function. We classify adverbs by specifying differ-
ences in meaning and preferred positions within sen-
tences for each adverb. The classification is shown
in Figure 1.

3 Word Ordering Method for
English Adverbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9977844">
Adverbs usually have many meanings, especially ad-
verbs which are used frequently in our daily life.
Normally the difference in meaning is indicated by
the position in the sentence.
The position of an adverb depends not only on
the adverb&apos;s meaning but also on the relationship
between the adverb and other sentence elements.

tion. shows the priority at some position, the left

side of the right arrow comes before the right side of
the right arrow in the sentence. The priority reflects
the scopes of adverbs. For example, conjuncts usu-
ally have wider scope than disjuncts, so conjuncts
come before disjuncts at the initial position.

4 Experimental Results

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.976136">
4.1 Experiment 1
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999215">
The first experiment is performed on sentences with
at least one Japanese adverb taken from the &amp;quot;Dictio-
nary of Basic Japanese Usage for Foreigners&amp;quot;. The
sentences are translated by a human translator. We
manually examined whether English adverbs in the
translation would be generated correctly using the
proposed method. The results of experiment 1 are
shown in Figure 3.

Japanese adverb entries: 362 words
sentences: 1,906 sentences

The second experiment had the Japanese to En-
glish machine translation system ALT-J/E translate
Japanese sentences to test various English adverb
functions. The goal was to confirm that this adverb
ordering method could handle various types of En-
glish adverbs.
The experiment considered 200 arbitrary sen-
tences which ALT-J/E was known to analyze cor-
rectly. This method was compared to a previous ver-
sion of ALT-J/E which did not use adverbs&apos; gram-
matical functions and meanings but only this pre-
ferred adverb positions. The result is as follows.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916888888889">
A new adverb classification based on adverb gram-
matical functions, meanings and adverb preferred
positions for English adverb generation in machine
translation was proposed. The effectiveness of the
English adverb ordering method in Japanese to En-
glish machine translation based on the adverb clas-
sification and the priority of the same adverb pre-
ferred positions is shown. The priority was decided
by examining sentences with adverbs to generate En-
glish adverbs in Japanese to English machine trans-
lation. If correct English adverbs are selected after
Japanese analysis and Japanese to English transfer,
about 97% of adverbs can be put correct positions
in sentences by this adverb ordering method. Com-
pared with the previous adverb ordering method, the
accuracy rate of the proposed method is improved
12%. The proposed method can also be used for
adverbial prepositional phrases.
