An Experience-Based
Theory of Language
Data Oriented Parsing
Rens Bod
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996835">
During the past few years, a new
approach to language processing has
started to emerge, which has become
known under the name of Data Ori-
ented Parsing (DOP). This approach
embodies the assumption that human
language perception and production
works with representations of concrete
past language experiences, rather than
with abstract grammar rules.

Emiel Jacques Krahmer

<bodyText confidence="0.9997141">
In this book, two related phenomena
are studied: presupposition and ana-
phora. Dynamic semantics is by now
widely accepted as a first-rate founda-
tion for such an exercise and it forms
the backbone of most of the work in
this book. A recurring additional theme
of the present book is the usefulness
of techniques from partial logic in the
treatment of both phenomena.

Dynamic Conceptual
Semantics
A Data-oriented Theory
of Concept Formation and
Understanding
Renate Bartsch
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.96699375">
Presented in this book is a theory of
concept formation and understanding
that does not make use of a notion of
an innate mental language as a means
of concept representation. Instead,
experiental concepts are treated seman-
tically as stabilizing structuring of
growing sets of data, which are sets of
experienced satisfaction situations for
expressions, and theoretical concepts
are based on coherent sets of general
sentences held true.

This volume brings together research
from both &amp;quot;cognitive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;functional&amp;quot;
approaches to linguistics. The collec-
tion includes work from cognitive
science disciplines whose concerns
overlap with linguistics, such as arti-
ficial intelligence, neurolinguistics
and psychology. Despite their diver-
sity, the papers in this volume are all
inspired by the same fundamental
question: To what extent is the
structure of languages affected by
human cognitive structures and
language use?

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.727751">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.919821">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: ,
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.964341888888889">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to
forty double-spaced, pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electronically;
consult http:/ /www.cs.columbia.edu/—radev/acl/subrnit.txt for instructions and pointers to
the LATEX style files. The submission of ah article to CL for refereeing means that the author
certifies the manuscript is not Copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publica-
tion to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a
non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on- issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

Squibs and Discussions: This category includes short articles reporting technical results, dis-
cussions of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest to the
journal readership. Submission format is the same as for regular papers, but the length should
in no case exceed eight journal pages. Electronic submissions (LATEX source, postscript or plain

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing,
and Very Large Corpora have been formed; others are likely to be added.
