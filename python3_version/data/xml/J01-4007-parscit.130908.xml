The standard preference ordering on the well-known centering transitions Continue, Retain, Shift
is argued to be unmotivated: a partial, context-dependent ordering emerges from the interaction
between principles dubbed cohesion (maintaining the same center of attention) and salience
(realizing the center of attention as the most prominent NP). A new formulation of Rule 2 of
centering theory is proposed that incorporates these principles as well as a streamlined version
of Strube and Hahn&apos;s (1999) notion of cheapness. It is argued that this formulation provides a
natural way to handle &amp;quot;topic switches&amp;quot; that appear to violate the canonical preference ordering.

1. What Is Centering?
Centering theory (henceforth CT) is a theory of local discourse structure that models
the interaction of referential continuity and salience of discourse entities in the internal
organization of a text. The main assumptions of the theory as presented by Grosz, Joshi,
and Weinstein (1995) (GJVV) and Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998) can be summarized
as follows:
1. For each utterance in a discourse there is precisely one entity that is the
center of attention.
2. There is a preference, formalized as Rule 2, (1) for consecutive utterances
within a discourse segment to keep the same entity as the center of
attention, and (2) for the entity most prominently realized in an
utterance to be identified as the center of attention.
3. The center of attention is the entity that is most likely to be
pronominalized: this preference is formalized as Rule 1.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994409">
These principles are more precisely explicated in Section 2.
An entity may become prominent as a referential link between successive utter-
ances, or it may deliberately be made prominent, for example, through a less oblique
grammatical role or by being mentioned early in a sentence. An attraction for nat-
ural language processing practitioners has been that CT&apos;s predictions are based on
easily computable structural properties of utterances rather than costly content-based
reasoning.
Standard expositions of CT hold that there is a total preference ordering over types
of transitions between utterances defined in terms of the tests mentioned in Point 2
above and formulated as Rule 2 in Table 1. I argue in what follows that the standard

account of CT both over- and undergenerates. On the one hand, the stipulated prefer-
ence for Retain over Smooth Shift has not been confirmed by empirical evidence, and
cannot be naturally incorporated in standard generation architectures. On the other
hand, there is no mechanism within the theory to predict specific cases where a Retain
or a Shift may be preferred over a Continue transition, as in the Retain-Shift pattern
that has been argued to signal the introduction of a new discourse topic (Brennan,
Friedman, and Pollard 1987 [BFP]; Strube and Hahn 1999). I aim to overcome these
difficulties under an analysis that gives a partial ordering of the classic transitions,
incorporating a &amp;quot;streamlined&amp;quot; version of Strube and Hahn&apos;s notion of &amp;quot;cheapness&amp;quot; to
handle the Retain-Shift pattern. I do not claim to offer new empirical results; the aim
is rather to consolidate existing results in a more economic and principled formulation
of Rule 2 itself.
Finally, given that CT addresses local rather than global coherence, we need to
consider the question, How local is &amp;quot;local&amp;quot;? Two possible notions of local coherence
are (1) overall coherence of a multi-utterance discourse segment (as in the original
GJW model, which stipulates preferences for coherent sequences of transitions)—this
has been called &amp;quot;not psychologically plausible from a speaker&apos;s perspective&amp;quot; (Brennan
1998, page 231); (2) coherence between immediately adjacent utterances, as in the BFP
algorithm, which replaces the original preference for sequences of transitions with a
preference ordering on transitions. In this paper, I explore an intermediate position
put forward by Strube and Hahn (1999), which is a preference over pairs of transitions
or triples of utterances, which may or may not cross segment boundaries.

The main claims of CT are formalized in terms of Cb, the backward-looking center;
Cf, a list of forward-looking centers for each utterance Un; and Cp or preferred center,
the most salient candidate for subsequent utterances. Cf(Un) is a partial ordering on
the entities mentioned (or &amp;quot;realized&amp;quot;) in Un, ranked by grammatical role; for example,
SUBJ &gt; DIR-OBJ &gt; INDIR-OBJ &gt; COMP(S) &gt; ADJUNCT(S). Cb(Un) is defined as the
highest-ranked member of Cf( U1) that is realized in U. Cp(Un) is the highest-ranked
member of Cf(11,), and is predicted to be Cb(Un+i)•
The ranking of Cf by grammatical role has been widely adopted in the litera-

to go into the details of the latter&apos;s &amp;quot;functional centering&amp;quot; model, as both make the
same predictions for the examples considered. Strube and Hahn themselves (page 334)

2.1 &amp;quot;Salience&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Cohesion&amp;quot;
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980052631579">
Transitions are defined in terms of two tests: whether the Cb stays the same (Cb(Un) =
Cb(Un-i)), and whether the Cb is realized as the most prominent NP (grammatically
or otherwise): Cb(U) = Cp(Un). For the sake of convenience and concision, I refer to
the first of these tests as cohesion and the second as salience; it is important to keep
in mind that I use the terms in these defined and limited ways, and to disregard
(for the time being) other uses of the terms in the literature. There are four possible
combinations, which are displayed in Table 2, resulting in the named transitions Con-
tinue, Retain, Smooth Shift, and Rough Shift. The optimal case, where both salience
and cohesion obtain, is Continue; the least preferred is Rough Shift. Walker, Joshi,
and Prince (1998), following BFP, stipulate that Retain is preferred over Smooth Shift,
which implies that cohesion is a stronger requirement than salience. However, corpus
analyses reported by di Eugenio (1998, page 127), Hurewitz (1998, pages 280ff.), and
Passoneau (1998, pages 338ff.) do not support this claim. In fact, all these researchers
found a higher percentage of Smooth Shifts than Retains. In a spoken corpus, Pas-
soneau found more Shifts than Continues.
A preponderance of Shifts over Continues may reflect the domain and content of a
text rather than the author&apos;s organizational goals. In fact, it can be seen that sequences
of Smooth Shifts are rather natural in certain kinds of narrative or descriptive texts;
see Example 1 (adapted from a pharmaceutical leaflet).

This does not appear to be an incoherent text, but there is no way that the content
could be rearranged to turn the Shifts into Continues. However, we can see that the
author has maintained centering coherence as far as the content allows.
We may conclude that not only does corpus evidence fail to confirm the canonical
ordering, but in fact corpus analysis itself is not sufficient to evaluate the claims of
CT without taking into account the underlying semantic content of a text. That is,
statistics about the relative frequency of occurrences of different transition types do
not in themselves tell us much about which transitions are preferred in particular
situations since they do not take account of the choices available to an author.&apos; A
more promising approach is that of Brennan (1998), who gave subjects the controlled
narrative task of providing a running commentary on a video recording of a basketball
game, and used the videotape itself to construct a &amp;quot;propositional script&amp;quot; listing the
sequence of events and their participants, and identifying players who were likely to
continue as the center of attention over a sequence of incidents.

2.2 Rule 2 Applied to Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990977333333333">
Reiter (1994) claimed that existing generation systems converged on a &amp;quot;consensus,&amp;quot;
generic natural language generation (NLG) architecture consisting of the following
tasks:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996444857142857">
• Content determination/text planning: deciding the content of a message
and organizing the component propositions into a text tree;
• Sentence planning: aggregating propositions into clausal units and
choosing lexical items corresponding to concepts in the knowledge base,
including referring expressions;
• Linguistic realization: taking care of surface details such as agreement
and orthography.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997219916666667">
I have argued elsewhere (Kibble 1999) that if CT is to be implemented in an NLG
system, the principles I call &amp;quot;salience&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cohesion&amp;quot; belong to different tasks within
this scheme: &amp;quot;salience&amp;quot; is a matter for sentence planning, choosing a verb form or
some other construction that makes the Cb prominent within a clause or sentence,
while &amp;quot;cohesion&amp;quot;—ordering propositions in a text to maintain referential continuity—
is a matter for text planning. So there may be no single point in the generation process
where the system has a choice between Retain and Shift, for instance: rather, the terms
retain and shift describe the composite results of choices made at different stages of the
generation task. This point is discussed in more detail in the cited paper. Referential
continuity as determined by CT is only one of a number of factors determining the
fluency and acceptability of generated text; see Kibble and Power (2000) for further
discussion.

3. The &amp;quot;Cheapness&amp;quot; Principle
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881190476191">
The Cp or preferred center has a dual role in CT: in optimal transitions, where Cp =
Cb, it highlights the center of attention of the current utterance, and it is also intended
to signal the center of attention of the following utterance:
The preferred center represents a prediction about the Cb of the follow-
ing utterance. (Walker, Joshi, and Prince 1998, page 3)
It turns out that this informally stated aspect of the Cp is not actually made explicit in
the rules and constraints of CT: transitions (U„, U41) are defined in terms of the Cp
of Un±i and the Cbs of Un and Un+1, but no definition mentions the Cp of U. Strube
and Hahn&apos;s &amp;quot;cheapness&amp;quot; principle can be seen as the &amp;quot;missing link&amp;quot; of CT, making
explicit the prediction represented by the Cp. They question the canonical ordering of
transitions, partly on the grounds that this ordering fails to predict the Retain—Shift
pattern that has been claimed by some researchers to signal the introduction of a new
&amp;quot;discourse topic.&amp;quot; The principle of &amp;quot;cheapness&amp;quot; is intended to capture the intuition
that a Retain is naturally followed by a Smooth Shift and is defined as follows:
A transition pair is cheap if the backward-looking center of the current
utterance is correctly predicted by the preferred center of the immedi-
ately preceding utterance, i.e., Cb(LJ) = Cp(U,_1) . . . (Strube and Hahn
1999, page 332)
Cheapness is claimed to minimize the inferential costs of processing sequences of
utterances, and is proposed as a constraint on pairs of successive transitions as a
replacement for the canonical orderings in Rule 2, which is restated as follows:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.756655">
Rule 2&apos;
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999067952380952">
Cheap transition pairs are preferred over expensive ones. (Strube and
Hahn 1999, page 334)
This claim is supported by analysis of a variety of German texts. It turns out that
although cheapness appears to be a sensible principle, it does not neatly partition the
types of transition pairs; in particular, this principle does not necessarily hold of all
Retain—Smooth Shift sequences. Strube and Hahn propose to rectify this by redefining
the transitions, with an additional test Cp(Ui) = Cp (U_1) to subdivide Continue and
Smooth Shift, resulting in new &amp;quot;expensive&amp;quot; transitions Exp-Continue and Exp-Smooth
Shift. Strube and Hahn (1999, page 333) provide a table (not reproduced here) of 36
transition pairs, labeled as &amp;quot;cheap,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;expensive,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; (not occurring).
In fact, it seems that the way this principle is presented is unnecessarily compli-
cated, and on closer examination it appears to be rather weak. First, if cheapness is the
only criterion considered, CT would have nothing to say about texts such as Example
1 that have no cheap transition pairs. So it appears unwise to simply abandon the
canonical ordering altogether. Second, the constraint on transition pairs can be stated
more economically in terms of triples of utterances. If it is the preferred case that for
every transition pair in a discourse ((Un-1, (lin, Un+1)), Cb(Un+i) = cp (1.-4,), then
this equation also holds for each triple (Un_i, U, Un+i) and vice versa. Note also that
if Cp(Un) is mentioned at all in Un+i, it is by definition the Cb of Un+1; so the require-
ment can be stated more simply as Cp(Un) E Cf(Un+i)• I propose that the cheapness
principle should supplement rather than replace the principles of salience and cohesion.

A consequence of this is that the choice of Cp for an utterance LI, has to look backward
to Un_i (to identify the current Cb) and forward to U+1. In general, the question of
which principles take precedence in cases of conflict cannot be settled in this short
paper, but I adopt the following working hypothesis: the optimal case will be the one
where both cheapness and salience obtain; the normal case will be the one where at
least one of them is satisfied, which may be at the expense of cohesion between the
current and the subsequent utterance. If the Cp is part of a &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; sequence, correctly
predicting the upcoming Cb, but does not identify the current Cb, this will normally
be signaled by a nonanaphoric nominal form.
Example 2 (adapted from GJW, page 217) illustrates the Retain-Shift pattern,
though it does not provide unambiguous support for the proposal sketched above.
The sequence (c-d-e) seems preferable to (c-d&apos;-e&apos;) even though the latter apparently
scores better according to the canonical ranking. In both sequences, cheapness is satis-
fied wherever it is applicable, but the apparently less preferred sequence scores higher
on salience and cohesion.

<bodyText confidence="0.999860555555556">
From an interpretation perspective, we can address this apparent discrepancy by
looking again at the interaction between Rule 1 and Rule 2. Rule 1 states that if
anything is pronominalized, the Cb will be; so in (d), for example, Mike cannot be
interpreted as the Cb because the sentence contains a pronoun in addition. So in fact
the Retain transition (c-d) is maximally coherent given the options available to the
reader: salience is not tested for because the Cp is not a pronoun, but both cohesion
and cheapness obtain. This choice means that Mike is predicted to be the new Cb of (e)
so cohesion will be unavailable for (d-e). In general, it appears that cheapness is most
likely to be an available option—the expectation that the current Cp will be the next
Cb is generally plausible—but salience and cohesion are not always available. Thus,
if we take account of the options available to a reader at each stage, both versions of
the discourse conform as far as possible to the principles of cohesion, salience, and
cheapness.
From a production perspective the question remains, Why has the author chosen
the &amp;quot;lumpy&amp;quot; sequence (c-d-e) rather than a &amp;quot;smooth&amp;quot; sequence of Continues? Some
possible answers are these: the preferred sequence uses simple, canonical active verb
forms, which may be easier to process; the sequence of clause-initial pronouns He. . .
He. . ., and so on, in the variant sequence makes it appear &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; and uninteresting;

the author is realizing a communicative goal to say something about John in (a-b-c)
and something about Mike in (d-e). The bottom line is that from a generation point of
view, centering is not enough. Maximizing coherent transitions will not in itself produce
optimally fluent and readable text; instead, a number of other factors have to be taken
into consideration in order to minimize the inferential load on the reader, hold the
reader&apos;s interest, and reflect communicative intentions.
Both versions of the text are preferable to one where the last two sentences have
different subjects: for example, (d) followed by (e&amp;quot;) John. . . . The intuition is that once
the topic has changed, the discourse must stay with the new topic rather than &amp;quot;flip-
flop&amp;quot; between two entities. This intuition can be sharpened by noting that (d-e) form an
identifiable embedded discourse segment, whose subject matter is not directly related
to the main issue of John&apos;s vacation plans. I conjecture that absence of salience is not
penalized in segment-initial utterances as long as cheapness holds.

This example suggests a need for optimization over sequences of more than two
utterances. In a sequence Continue—Retain--Smooth Shift, the Shift is predicted in its
local context but the Retain is not; although Retain is a cheap transition following
Continue, another Continue would be cheap as well. The Retain is motivated as it
allows a new topic to be introduced with a &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; Smooth Shift, and so we need
to evaluate the whole sequence Continue—Retain—Smooth Shift. This illustrates that
while a sequence that conforms to the cheapness principle may reduce the cognitive
load on the hearer, it can actually increase the load on the speaker owing to the need
to plan ahead beyond the current utterance. In fact, the proposals outlined here do
not entail that speakers must plan the entire content and structure of sentences so far
in advance. Rather, they entail that a speaker knows when uttering Un that he or she
intends to express a particular fact about a particular entity E in utterance 1112+2; and
it entails that the speaker would do well to prepare the hearer for this by making E
prominent in utterance U+1. The hypothesis is that speakers will make a degree of
effort to help hearers to process their utterances smoothly, rather than opportunistically
planning and realizing sentences one by one, but not to the extent of planning all the
transitions in a discourse segment in advance of uttering anything.

4. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994866842105263">
Comparison of the standard preference ordering for centering transitions and Strube
and Hahn&apos;s (1999) variant has established the following points:
1. The strict ordering of canonical transitions assumed by GJW and others has not
(so far) been confirmed by corpus evidence and does not naturally fit into generation
architectures. There is no mechanism to predict the Retain—Shift sequence to introduce
a new discourse topic.
2. By reducing Rule 2 to a requirement for cheap transition pairs, Strube and Hahn
weaken the predictive power of the theory while complicating the apparatus with two
additional transitions and a 36-position table of cheap versus expensive pairs.
I have argued that in fact we can dispense with not only Strube and Hahn&apos;s two
new transition types but the four old ones as well, retaining them only for descriptive
convenience. The various different transitions can be seen to emerge in a partial, context-
dependent ordering as a result of the interaction of cohesion, salience, and cheapness.
Following established practice in empirical work such as that discussed in Section
2.1, centering coherence is applied to inter- as well as intrasegmental transitions. The
modified proposal is still weaker than GJW&apos;s original formulation as a wider variety
of texts is tolerated. This underscores the fact that referential continuity as specified
by CT may play an essential part in computing the overall coherence of utterance
transitions but it is only one of the determinants of discourse structure.

<abstract confidence="0.989566774193548">The standard preference ordering on the well-known centering transitions Continue, Retain, Shift is argued to be unmotivated: a partial, context-dependent ordering emerges from the interaction principles dubbed the same center of attention) and (realizing the center of attention as the most prominent NP). A new formulation of Rule 2 of centering theory is proposed that incorporates these principles as well as a streamlined version Strube and Hahn&apos;s (1999) notion of is argued that this formulation provides a natural way to handle &amp;quot;topic switches&amp;quot; that appear to violate the canonical preference ordering. 1. What Is Centering? Centering theory (henceforth CT) is a theory of local discourse structure that models the interaction of referential continuity and salience of discourse entities in the internal organization of a text. The main assumptions of the theory as presented by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) (GJVV) and Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998) can be summarized as follows: 1. For each utterance in a discourse there is precisely one entity that is the center of attention. There is a preference, formalized as 2, for consecutive utterances within a discourse segment to keep the same entity as the center of attention, and (2) for the entity most prominently realized in an utterance to be identified as the center of attention. 3. The center of attention is the entity that is most likely to be this preference is formalized as 1. These principles are more precisely explicated in Section 2. An entity may become prominent as a referential link between successive utterances, or it may deliberately be made prominent, for example, through a less oblique grammatical role or by being mentioned early in a sentence. An attraction for natural language processing practitioners has been that CT&apos;s predictions are based on easily computable structural properties of utterances rather than costly content-based reasoning. Standard expositions of CT hold that there is a total preference ordering over types of transitions between utterances defined in terms of the tests mentioned in Point 2 and formulated as Rule 2 in Table 1. in what follows that the standard</abstract>

I do not claim to offer new empirical results; the aim is rather to consolidate existing results in a more economic and principled formulation of Rule 2 itself. Finally, given that CT addresses local rather than global coherence, we need to consider the question, How local is &amp;quot;local&amp;quot;? Two possible notions of local coherence are (1) overall coherence of a multi-utterance discourse segment (as in the original GJW model, which stipulates preferences for coherent sequences of transitions)—this has been called &amp;quot;not psychologically plausible from a speaker&apos;s perspective&amp;quot; (Brennan 1998, page 231); (2) coherence between immediately adjacent utterances, as in the BFP algorithm, which replaces the original preference for sequences of transitions with a preference ordering on transitions. In this paper, I explore an intermediate position put forward by Strube and Hahn (1999), which is a preference over pairs of transitions or triples of utterances, which may or may not cross segment boundaries. 2. Transition Rules The main claims of CT are formalized in terms of Cb, the backward-looking center; Cf, a list of forward-looking centers for each utterance Un; and Cp or preferred cen</context>
<context position="9369" citStr="Brennan (1998)" startWordPosition="1502" endWordPosition="1503">tained centering coherence as far as the content allows. We may conclude that not only does corpus evidence fail to confirm the canonical ordering, but in fact corpus analysis itself is not sufficient to evaluate the claims of CT without taking into account the underlying semantic content of a text. That is, statistics about the relative frequency of occurrences of different transition types do not in themselves tell us much about which transitions are preferred in particular situations since they do not take account of the choices available to an author.&apos; A more promising approach is that of Brennan (1998), who gave subjects the controlled narrative task of providing a running commentary on a video recording of a basketball game, and used the videotape itself to construct a &amp;quot;propositional script&amp;quot; listing the sequence of events and their participants, and identifying players who were likely to continue as the center of attention over a sequence of incidents. 2.2 Rule 2 Applied to Generation Reiter (1994) claimed that existing generation systems converged on a &amp;quot;consensus,&amp;quot; generic natural language generation (NLG) architecture consisting of the following tasks: • Content determination/text planni</context>

In fact, all these researchers found a higher percentage of Smooth Shifts than Retains. In a spoken corpus, Passoneau found more Shifts than Continues. A preponderance of Shifts over Continues may reflect the domain and content of a text rather than the author&apos;s organizational goals.
