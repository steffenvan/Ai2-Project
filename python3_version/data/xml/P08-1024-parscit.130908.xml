Large-scale discriminative machine transla-
tion promises to further the state-of-the-art,
but has failed to deliver convincing gains over
current heuristic frequency count systems. We
argue that a principle reason for this failure is
not dealing with multiple, equivalent transla-
tions. We present a translation model which
models derivations as a latent variable, in both
training and decoding, and is fully discrimina-
tive and globally optimised. Results show that
accounting for multiple derivations does in-
deed improve performance. Additionally, we
show that regularisation is essential for max-
imum conditional likelihood models in order
to avoid degenerate solutions.

Statistical machine translation (SMT) has seen
a resurgence in popularity in recent years, with
progress being driven by a move to phrase-based and
syntax-inspired approaches. Progress within these
approaches however has been less dramatic. We be-
lieve this is because these frequency count based&apos;
models cannot easily incorporate non-independent
and overlapping features, which are extremely use-
ful in describing the translation process. Discrimi-
native models of translation can include such fea-
tures without making assumptions of independence
or explicitly modelling their interdependence. How-
ever, while discriminative models promise much,
they have not been shown to deliver significant gains

and do not support large sets of non-independent features.
over their simpler cousins. We argue that this is due
to a number of inherent problems that discrimina-
tive models for SMT must address, in particular the
problems of spurious ambiguity and degenerate so-
lutions. These occur when there are many ways to
translate a source sentence to the same target sen-
tence by applying a sequence of steps (a derivation)
of either phrase translations or synchronous gram-
mar rules, depending on the type of system. Exist-
ing discriminative models require a reference deriva-
tion to optimise against, however no parallel cor-
pora annotated for derivations exist. Ideally, a model
would account for this ambiguity by marginalising
out the derivations, thus predicting the best transla-
tion rather than the best derivation. However, doing
so exactly is NP-complete. For this reason, to our
knowledge, all discriminative models proposed to
date either side-step the problem by choosing simple
model and feature structures, such that spurious am-
biguity is lessened or removed entirely (Ittycheriah
and Roukos, 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007), or else ig-
nore the problem and treat derivations as translations
(Liang et al., 2006; Tillmann and Zhang, 2007).
In this paper we directly address the problem of
spurious ambiguity in discriminative models. We
use a synchronous context free grammar (SCFG)
translation system (Chiang, 2007), a model which
has yielded state-of-the-art results on many transla-
tion tasks. We present two main contributions. First,
we develop a log-linear model of translation which
is globally trained on a significant number of paral-
lel sentences. This model maximises the conditional
likelihood of the data, p(e|f), where e and f are the
English and foreign sentences, respectively. Our es-
timation method is theoretically sound, avoiding the
biases of the heuristic relative frequency estimates

scale) for each reference sentence in our training corpus.
(Koehn et al., 2003). Second, within this frame-
work, we model the derivation, d, as a latent vari-
able, p(e, d1f), which is marginalised out in train-
ing and decoding. We show empirically that this
treatment results in significant improvements over a
maximum-derivation model.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2
we list the challenges that discriminative SMT must
face above and beyond the current systems. We sit-
uate our work, and previous work, on discrimina-
tive systems in this context. We present our model
in Section 3, including our means of training and de-
coding. Section 4 reports our experimental setup and
results, and finally we conclude in Section 5.

2 Challenges for Discriminative SMT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983521611111111">
Discriminative models allow for the use of expres-
sive features, in the order of thousands or millions,
which can reference arbitrary aspects of the source
sentence. Given most successful SMT models have
a highly lexicalised grammar (or grammar equiva-
lent), these features can be used to smuggle in lin-
guistic information, such as syntax and document
context. With this undoubted advantage come four
major challenges when compared to standard fre-
quency count SMT models:
1. There is no one reference derivation. Often
there are thousands of ways of translating a
source sentence into the reference translation.
Figure 1 illustrates the exponential relationship
between sentence length and the number of
derivations. Training is difficult without a clear
target, and predicting only one derivation at test
time is fraught with danger.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9687908">
2. Parallel translation data is often very noisy,
with such problems as non-literal translations,
poor sentence- and word-alignments. A model
which exactly translates the training data will
inevitably perform poorly on held-out data.
This problem of over-fitting is exacerbated
in discriminative models with large, expres-
sive, feature sets. Regularisation is essential for
models with more than a handful of features.
3. Learning with a large feature set requires many
training examples and typically many iterations
of a solver during training. While current mod-
els focus solely on efficient decoding, discrim-
inative models must also allow for efficient
training.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999798551724138">
Past work on discriminative SMT only address
some of these problems. To our knowledge no sys-
tems directly address Problem 1, instead choosing to
ignore the problem by using one or a small handful
of reference derivations in an n-best list (Liang et al.,
2006; Watanabe et al., 2007), or else making local
independence assumptions which side-step the issue
(Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007; Tillmann and Zhang,
2007; Wellington et al., 2006). These systems all in-
clude regularisation, thereby addressing Problem 2.
An interesting counterpoint is the work of DeNero et
al. (2006), who show that their unregularised model
finds degenerate solutions. Some of these discrim-
inative systems have been trained on large training
sets (Problem 3); these systems are the local models,
for which training is much simpler. Both the global
models (Liang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007)
use fairly small training sets, and there is no evi-
dence that their techniques will scale to larger data
sets.
Our model addresses all three of the above prob-
lems within a global model, without resorting to n-
best lists or local independence assumptions. Fur-
thermore, our model explicitly accounts for spurious
ambiguity without altering the model structure or ar-
bitrarily selecting one derivation. Instead we model
the translation distribution with a latent variable for
the derivation, which we marginalise out in training
and decoding.

he does not go
This itself provides robustness to noisy data, in
addition to the explicit regularisation from a prior
over the model parameters. For example, in many
cases there is no one perfect derivation, but rather
many imperfect ones which each include some good
translation fragments. The model can learn from
many of these derivations and thereby learn from
all these translation fragments. This situation is il-
lustrated in Figure 2 where the non-translated ad-
jective red means neither segmentation is ‘correct’,
although both together present positive evidence for
the two lexical translations.
We present efficient methods for training and pre-
diction, demonstrating their scaling properties by
training on more than a hundred thousand train-
ing sentences. Finally, we stress that our main find-
ings are general ones. These results could – and
should – be applied to other models, discriminative
and generative, phrase- and syntax-based, to further
progress the state-of-the-art in machine translation.

A synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) con-
sists of paired CFG rules with co-indexed non-
terminals (Lewis II and Stearns, 1968). By assign-
ing the source and target languages to the respective
sides of a SCFG it is possible to describe translation
as the process of parsing the source sentence using
a CFG, while generating the target translation from
the other (Chiang, 2007). All the models we present
use the grammar extraction technique described in
Chiang (2007), and are bench-marked against our
own implementation of this hierarchical model (Hi-
ero). Figure 3 shows a simple instance of a hierar-
chical grammar with two non-terminals. Note that
our approach is general and could be used with other
synchronous grammar transducers (e.g., Galley et al.

3.1 A global log-linear model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999631583333333">
Our log-linear translation model defines a condi-
tional probability distribution over the target trans-
lations of a given source sentence. A particular se-
quence of SCFG rule applications which produces a
translation from a source sentence is referred to as a
derivation, and each translation may be produced by
many different derivations. As the training data only
provides source and target sentences, the derivations
are modelled as a latent variable.
The conditional probability of a derivation, d, for
a target translation, e, conditioned on the source, f,
is given by:

where Hk(d, e, f) =
rEd
Here k ranges over the model’s features, and
Λ = {Ak} are the model parameters (weights for
their corresponding features). The feature functions
Hk are predefined real-valued functions over the
source and target sentences, and can include over-
lapping and non-independent features of the data.
The features must decompose with the derivation,
as shown in (2). The features can reference the en-
tire source sentence coupled with each rule, r, in a
derivation. The distribution is globally normalised
by the partition function, ZA(f), which sums out the
numerator in (1) for every derivation (and therefore
every translation) of f:

Most prior work in SMT, both generative and dis-
criminative, has approximated the sum over deriva-
tions by choosing a single ‘best’ derivation using a
Viterbi or beam search algorithm. In this work we
show that it is both tractable and desirable to directly
account for derivational ambiguity. Our findings
echo those observed for latent variable log-linear
models successfully used in monolingual parsing
(Clark and Curran, 2007; Petrov et al., 2007). These
models marginalise over derivations leading to a de-
pendency structure and splits of non-terminal cate-
gories in a PCFG, respectively.

3.2 Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924307692308">
The parameters of our model are estimated
from our training sample using a maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimator. This maximises
the likelihood of the parallel training sen-
tences, D = {(e, f)}, penalised using a prior,
i.e., AMAP = arg maxA pA(D)p(A). We use a
zero-mean Gaussian prior with the probability
density function p0(Ak) a exp (−A2k/2�2).2 This
results in the following log-likelihood objective and
corresponding gradient:
In order to train the model, we maximise equation
(4) using L-BFGS (Malouf, 2002; Sha and Pereira,
2003). This method has been demonstrated to be ef-
fective for (non-convex) log-linear models with la-
tent variables (Clark and Curran, 2004; Petrov et al.,
2007). Each L-BFGS iteration requires the objective
value and its gradient with respect to the model pa-
rameters. These are calculated using inside-outside
inference over the feature forest defined by the
SCFG parse chart of f yielding the partition func-
tion, ZA(f), required for the log-likelihood, and the
marginals, required for its derivatives.
Efficiently calculating the objective and its gradi-
ent requires two separate packed charts, each rep-
resenting a derivation forest. The first one is the full
chart over the space of possible derivations given the

source sentence. The inside-outside algorithm over
this chart gives the marginal probabilities for each
chart cell, from which we can find the feature ex-
pectations. The second chart contains the space of
derivations which produce the reference translation
from the source. The derivations in this chart are a
subset of those in the full derivation chart. Again,
we use the inside-outside algorithm to find the ‘ref-
erence’ feature expectations from this chart. These
expectations are analogous to the empirical observa-
tion of maximum entropy classifiers.
Given these two charts we can calculate the log-
likelihood of the reference translation as the inside-
score from the sentence spanning cell of the ref-
erence chart, normalised by the inside-score of the
spanning cell from the full chart. The gradient is cal-
culated as the difference of the feature expectations
of the two charts. Clark and Curran (2004) provides
a more complete discussion of parsing with a log-
linear model and latent variables.
The full derivation chart is produced using a CYK
parser in the same manner as Chiang (2005), and has
complexity O(|e|3). We produce the reference chart
by synchronously parsing the source and reference
sentences using a variant of CYK algorithm over two
dimensions, with a time complexity of O(|e|3|f|3).
This is an instance of the ITG alignment algorithm
(Wu, 1997). This step requires the reference transla-
tion for each training instance to be contained in the
model’s hypothesis space. Achieving full coverage
implies inducing a grammar which generates all ob-
served source-target pairs, which is difficult in prac-
tise. Instead we discard the unreachable portion of
the training sample (24% in our experiments). The
proportion of discarded sentences is a function of
the grammar used. Extraction heuristics other than
the method used herein (Chiang, 2007) could allow
complete coverage (e.g., Galley et al. (2004)).

3.3 Decoding

<bodyText confidence="0.9996647">
Accounting for all derivations of a given transla-
tion should benefit not only training, but also decod-
ing. Unfortunately marginalising over derivations in
decoding is NP-complete. The standard solution is
to approximate the maximum probability translation
using a single derivation (Koehn et al., 2003).
Here we approximate the sum over derivations di-
rectly using a beam search in which we produce a
beam of high probability translation sub-strings for
each cell in the parse chart. This algorithm is sim-

ilar to the methods for decoding with a SCFG in-
tersected with an n-gram language model, which re-
quire language model contexts to be stored in each
chart cell. However, while Chiang (2005) stores an
abbreviated context composed of the n − 1 target
words on the left and right edge of the target sub-
string, here we store the entire target string. Addi-
tionally, instead of maximising scores in each beam
cell, we sum the inside scores for each derivation
that produces a given string for that cell. When the
beam search is complete we have a list of trans-
lations in the top beam cell spanning the entire
source sentence along with their approximated in-
side derivation scores. Thus we can assign each
translation string a probability by normalising its in-
side score by the sum of the inside scores of all the
translations spanning the entire sentence.
Figure 4 illustrates the search process for the sim-
ple grammar from Table 2. Each graph node repre-
sents a hypothesis translation substring covering a
sub-span of the source string. The space of trans-
lation sub-strings is exponential in each cell’s span,
and our algorithm can only sum over a small fraction
of the possible strings. Therefore the resulting prob-
abilities are only estimates. However, as demon-
strated in Section 4, this algorithm is considerably
more effective than maximum derivation (Viterbi)
decoding.

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990108695652">
Our model evaluation was motivated by the follow-
ing questions: (1) the effect of maximising transla-
tions rather than derivations in training and decod-
ing; (2) whether a regularised model performs better
than a maximum likelihood model; (3) how the per-
formance of our model compares with a frequency
count based hierarchical system; and (4) how trans-
lation performance scales with the number of train-
ing examples.
We performed all of our experiments on the
Europarl V2 French-English parallel corpus.3 The
training data was created by filtering the full cor-
pus for all the French sentences between five and
fifteen words in length, resulting in 170K sentence
pairs. These limits were chosen as a compromise
between experiment turnaround time and leaving
a large enough corpus to obtain indicative results.
The development and test data was taken from the
2006 NAACL and 2007 ACL workshops on ma-
chine translation, also filtered for sentence length.4
Tuning of the regularisation parameter and MERT
training of the benchmark models was performed on
dev2006, while the test set was the concatenation
of devtest2006, test2006 and test2007, amounting to
315 development and 1164 test sentences.
Here we focus on evaluating our model’s basic
ability to learn a conditional distribution from sim-
ple binary features, directly comparable to those
currently employed in frequency count models. As
such, our base model includes a single binary iden-
tity feature per-rule, equivalent to the p(e|f) param-
eters defined on each rule in standard models.
As previously noted, our model must be able to
derive the reference sentence from the source for it
to be included in training. For both our discrimina-
tive and benchmark (Hiero) we extracted our gram-
mar on the 170K sentence corpus using the approach
described in Chiang (2007), resulting in 7.8 million
rules. The discriminative model was then trained on
the training partition, however only 130K of the sen-
tences were used as the model could not produce
a derivation of the reference for the remaining sen-
tences. There were many grammar rules that the dis-
criminative model did not observe in a reference
derivation, and thus could not assign their feature a
positive weight. While the benchmark model has a

biguity present in the training data, with fifteen word
sentences averaging over 70M reference derivations.
Performance is evaluated using cased BLEU4
score on the test set. Although there is no direct rela-
tionship between BLEU and likelihood, it provides
a rough measure for comparing performance.
Derivational ambiguity Table 1 shows the im-
pact of accounting for derivational ambiguity in
training and decoding.5 There are two options for
training, we could use our latent variable model and
optimise the probability of all derivations of the
reference translation, or choose a single derivation
that yields the reference and optimise its probability
alone. The second option raises the difficult question
of which one, of the thousands available, we should
choose? We use the derivation which contains the
most rules. The intuition is that small rules are likely
to appear more frequently, and thus generalise bet-
ter to a test set. In decoding we can search for the
maximum probability derivation, which is the stan-
dard practice in SMT, or for the maximum probabil-
ity translation which is what we actually want from
our model, i.e. the best translation.
The results clearly indicate the value in opti-
mising translations, rather than derivations. Max-
translation decoding for the model trained on single
derivations has only a small positive effect, while for
the latent variable model the impact is much larger.6
For example, our max-derivation model trained
on the Europarl data translates carte sur la table as
on the table card. This error in the reordering of card
(which is an acceptable translation of carte) is due
to the rule (X) —* (carte X 1, X 1 card) being the
highest scoring rule for carte. This is reasonable, as

carte is a noun, which in the training data, is often
observed with a trailing adjective which needs to be
reordered when translating into English. In the ex-
ample there is no adjective, but the simple hierarchi-
cal grammar cannot detect this. The max-translation
model finds a good translation card on the table.
This is due to the many rules that enforce monotone
ordering around sur la, (X) —* (X 1 sur, X 1 in)
(X) —* (X 1 sur la X 2, X 1 in the X 2) etc.
The scores of these many monotone rules sum to be
greater than the reordering rule, thus allowing the
model to use the weight of evidence to settle on the
correct ordering.
Having established that the search for the best
translation is effective, the question remains as to
how the beam width over partial translations affects
performance. Figure 5 shows the relationship be-
tween beam width and development BLEU. Even
with a very tight beam of 100, max-translation de-
coding outperforms maximum-derivation decoding,
and performance is increasing even at a width of
10k. In subsequent experiments we use a beam of
5k which provides a good trade-off between perfor-
mance and speed.
Regularisation Table 1 shows that the per-
formance of an unregularised maximum likeli-
hood model lags well behind the regularised max-
translation model. From this we can conclude that
the maximum likelihood model is overfitting the
training set. We suggest that is a result of the degen-
erate solutions of the conditional maximum likeli-
hood estimate, as described in DeNero et al. (2006).
Here we assert that our regularised maximum a pos-

teriori model avoids such solutions.
This is illustrated in Table 2, which shows the
conditional probabilities for rules, obtained by lo-
cally normalising the rule feature weights for a sim-
ple grammar extracted from the ambiguous pair of
sentences presented in DeNero et al. (2006). The
first column of conditional probabilities corresponds
to a maximum likelihood estimate, i.e., without reg-
ularisation. As expected, the model finds a degener-
ate solution in which overlapping rules are exploited
in order to minimise the entropy of the rule trans-
lation distributions. The second column shows the
solution found by our model when regularised by a
Gaussian prior with unit variance. Here we see that
the model finds the desired solution in which the true
ambiguity of the translation rules is preserved. The
intuition is that in order to find a degenerate solu-
tion, dispreferred rules must be given large negative
weights. However the prior penalises large weights,
and therefore the best strategy for the regularised
model is to evenly distribute probability mass.
Translation comparison Having demonstrated
that accounting for derivational ambiguity leads to
improvements for our discriminative model, we now
place the performance of our system in the context
of the standard approach to hierarchical translation.
To do this we use our own implementation of Hiero
(Chiang, 2007), with the same grammar but with the
traditional generative feature set trained in a linear
model with minimum BLEU training. The feature
set includes: a trigram language model (lm) trained

d , plex
r ), a binary flag for the glue rule which al-
lows the model to (dis)favour monotone translation
(gr); and rule and target word counts (rc, wc).
Table 3 shows the results of our system on the
test set. Firstly we show the relative scores of our
model against Hiero without using reverse transla-
tion or lexical features.7 This allows us to directly
study the differences between the two translation
models without the added complication of the other
features. As well as both modelling the same dis-
tribution, when our model is trained with a single
parameter per-rule these systems have the same pa-
rameter space, differing only in the manner of esti-
mation.
Additionally we show the scores achieved by
MERT training the full set of features for Hiero, with
and without a language model.8 We provide these
results for reference. To compare our model directly
with these systems we would need to incorporate ad-
ditional features and a language model, work which
we have left for a later date.
The relative scores confirm that our model, with
its minimalist feature set, achieves comparable per-
formance to the standard feature set without the lan-
guage model. This is encouraging as our model was
trained to optimise likelihood rather than BLEU, yet
it is still competitive on that metric. As expected,
the language model makes a significant difference to
BLEU, however we believe that this effect is orthog-
onal to the choice of base translation model, thus we
would expect a similar gain when integrating a lan-
guage model into the discriminative system.
An informal comparison of the outputs on the de-
velopment set, presented in Table 4, suggests that the
7Although the most direct comparison for the discriminative
model would be with pd model alone, omitting the gr, rc and
wc features and MERT training produces poor translations.

translation optimising discriminative model more
often produces quite fluent translations, yet not in
ways that would lead to an increase in BLEU score.9
This could be considered a side-effect of optimising
likelihood rather than BLEU.
Scaling In Figure 6 we plot the scaling charac-
teristics of our models. The systems shown in the
graph use the full grammar extracted on the 170k
sentence corpus. The number of sentences upon
which the iterative training algorithm is used to esti-
mate the parameters is varied from 10k to the max-
imum 130K for which our model can reproduce the
reference translation. As expected, the more data
used to train the system, the better the performance.
However, as the performance is still increasing sig-
nificantly when all the parseable sentences are used,
it is clear that the system’s performance is suffering
from the large number (40k) of sentences that are
discarded before training.

Our model avoids the estimation biases associated
with heuristic frequency count approaches and uses
standard regularisation techniques to avoid degener-
ate maximum likelihood solutions.
Having demonstrated the efficacy of our model
with very simple features, the logical next step is
to investigate more expressive features. Promising
features might include those over source side re-
ordering rules (Wang et al., 2007) or source con-
text features (Carpuat and Wu, 2007). Rule fre-
quency features extracted from large training cor-
pora would help the model to overcome the issue of
unreachable reference sentences. Such approaches
have been shown to be effective in log-linear word-
alignment models where only a small supervised
corpus is available (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006).
Finally, while in this paper we have focussed on
the science of discriminative machine translation,
we believe that with suitable engineering this model
will advance the state-of-the-art. To do so would
require integrating a language model feature into
the max-translation decoding algorithm. The use of
richer, more linguistic grammars (e.g., Galley et al.
(2004)) may also improve the system.

<abstract confidence="0.999102">Large-scale discriminative machine translation promises to further the state-of-the-art, but has failed to deliver convincing gains over current heuristic frequency count systems. We argue that a principle reason for this failure is not dealing with multiple, equivalent translations. We present a translation model which models derivations as a latent variable, in both training and decoding, and is fully discriminative and globally optimised. Results show that accounting for multiple derivations does indeed improve performance. Additionally, we show that regularisation is essential for maximum conditional likelihood models in order to avoid degenerate solutions.</abstract>
