No! It is properly an application of linguistics, and there-
in lies the critical point that Kimmo Kettunun seems to
miss. Other than that, I have only a few problems with
what Mr. Kettunen says.
MT is an application of linguistics; as such, MT system
developers are, first and foremost, required to produce an
operational system. It is doubtful that anyone who has
not produced a real-world application can appreciate the
sacrifices of theoretical niceties that entails. More to the
point, it is unlikely that any such individual can appreci-
ate the degree to which linguistic theory fails to account
for linguistic fact. Thus, while it is incontestably the case
that theoretical advances are necessary, it is nevertheless
true that MT system developers have less time to engage
in theorizing than they might like. Theoretical linguists,
for their part, seldom if ever engage in application devel-
opment. MT system developers generally circumvent this
impasse by applying the [parts of] theories that admit
application, and either developing new theory on-the-fly
or, more often, constructing necessarily ad hoc solutions
to the problems they face. Such is the fate of developers
everywhere, who applaud the fabrication of more nearly
accurate, better specified, and more applicable theories.
My second point relates to the open-endedness of
language. If languages are open-ended to the extent that
they &amp;quot;cannot be easily — if at all — described with deter-
ministic methods, i.e., using computers and algorithms&amp;quot;,
then one can rest assured that linguistic theory will be
stymied for exactly the same reasons. After all, a theory,
properly speaking, is necessarily testable (by definition).
My third point relates to the way things are. The
statement &amp;quot;So, to be cost-effective, an MT system has to
produce output that is good enough to need little or no
human post-editing&amp;quot; is seriously flawed. As a matter of
record, it has been demonstrated, for several MT systems,
that cost-effectiveness has been achieved even though a
significant amount of post-editing is performed. More
astounding, the discussant casually assumes that one
should expect MT systems to be usable with &amp;quot; . . . no
human post-editing&amp;quot;, all the while agreeing that
&amp;quot;everyone with some experience in translation knows&amp;quot;
that &amp;quot;it is not unusual for [translation] products to be
revised many times.&amp;quot; This is the standard trap that I
worked so diligently to point out in my paper: where
organizations employe post-editing [of human trans-
lations] now, they will continue to employe it [for
machine translations] in the future. In other words, a
second opinion will be rendered, in consonance with stan-
dard translation practice today. Why should things be
otherwise, in principle or in practice?
In closing, I note the discussant&apos;s twice-stated claim
that &amp;quot;MT . . . should pay more attention to its linguistic
premises.&amp;quot; He is apparently unfamiliar with the literature
regarding recent MT systems, so I refer him to the other
papers in issues 1 through 3 of Volume 11 of this journal.
The point is, modern MT development projects most
assuredly are attending to linguistic premises. It is sad,
but true, that these are inadequate, as anyone attempting
linguistic applications knows. We all look forward to
testing newer and better theories. All to often,
&amp;quot;theories&amp;quot; as stated are not testable — or, if testable, are
falsified — so we all eagerly await the maturation of
linguistics as a science. Perhaps the discussant will join
us in contributing to this process, whether as a theoreti-
cian or an experimentalist.
