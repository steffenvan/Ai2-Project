Of the various subdisciplines in Artificial Intelli-
gence, only a few have matured to the state that prac-
tical application seems imminent. Of these, computa-
tional linguistics appears to be a leading contender for
real world applications in the immediate future. One
area of special interest to the Naval Research Labora-
tory (NRL) is the application of computational linguis-
tics in automated message systems.
The scheduled meeting of the ACL at Stanford
University June 29-July 1, provided an opportunity for
a workshop June 26-27 at Stanford. The workshop,
&amp;quot;Applied Computational Linguistics in Perspective&amp;quot;,
was organized in May 1981 as a joint effort by NRL,
ACL, and the National Science Foundation (NSF),
with funding provided by the Office of Naval Research
(ONR). The goal of the workshop was to establish an
informed consensus on realistic expectations for ap-
plied computational linguistics within a five year time
frame. The workshop program committee, consisting
of Carroll Johnson, Chairman (NRL Visiting Scien-
tist), Joan Bachenko (NRL), Henry Hamburger
(NSF), and Norman Sondheimer (Sperry Univac),
invited five panel chairmen who in turn invited the
members of their respective panels.
Discussions with several individuals from ONR,
DARPA, NSF, and the Air Force Office of Scientific
Research (AFOSR) helped focus the choice of panel
topics. These topics mapped remarkably well onto the
problem of developing automated message systems.
Therefore, this problem was used as a general theme
for the workshop discussions.
In general, the message systems problem concerns
the distribution of information among message senders
and recipients, where the information encoded in a
message is coordinated and augmented by a dynamic
knowledge base that represents the current operationalâ€¢
situation. Incoming messages update the knowledge
base, which may modify the address, the priority, or
even the content of a message before the message is
disseminated. Such a system might use computational
linguistics in several ways. For example, maintaining
an updated dynamic situation model requires a human
supervisor who can monitor the system&apos;s conclusions
and override its decisions, when necessary. A Natural
Language Interface between the situation model data-
base and the person in charge thus provides one appli-
cation for computational linguistics. If updating re-
quires that a message be modified, Text Generation
provides a second application area in which computa-
tional linguistic techniques might be used to rewrite
portions of a message or to append an update note. A
third application area is Concept Extraction, which
extracts information from an incoming message and
builds a suitable knowledge base representation. A
fourth area, Machine Translation, may increase the
effectiveness of multinational operations where the
native language of a message originator differs from
that of a message recipient. Finally, studies in Sublan-
guage provide a linguistic foundation for each of these
applications.
