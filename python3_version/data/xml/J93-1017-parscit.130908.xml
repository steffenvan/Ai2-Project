is fascinating volume comes out of the
research of the Linguistic Specifications
Group of the Eurotra Project, an EC-funded
project for machine translation between EC
languages. It finds that machine translation is
not merely a mechanical process but in fact re-
quires a high level of linguistic sophistication.
Practical reality has ensured that machine
translation will be a major growth area in the
1990s with an increasing necessity for com-
munication on a much wider scale.

Natural language generation is the
process of turning a representation of
a &amp;quot;situation&amp;quot; into an expression of some
relevant portion of that situation, in a
natural language text. This book describes
in detail the structures of a level of repre-
sentation called a Text Planner, in the
Spokesman generation system, which is an
intermediate between the representation of
the world and language itself.

Systemic linguistics interprets and repre-
sents language not as a rule-system for
generating structures but as a resource for
expressing and making meanings. Using ex-
amples from English and Japanese, the
authors explain what systemic-functional lin-
guistics is, and how it can be useful in the
task of text generation.

Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are
paid. Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most
ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. A late payment fee will be charged for
renewals made after 1 April; this fee does not apply to new members. Institutions now subscribe to the journal
through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; +1-617-253-2889. Back issues and
proceedings are available only from the ACL, except that institutions should backorder journals for 1988 and follow-
ing years through MIT Press. Payments for dues, back issues, and proceedings can be made in Europe and Japan as
well as the U.S. Read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify institutional
affiliation, if it is not part of your address. Also provide telephone country &amp; region codes and computer network &amp;

<bodyText confidence="0.95912825">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.

Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997242625">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language
processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the
Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been
formed; others are likely to be added.
