The ACL Series will offer books of high quality in the field of
natural language processing, including human and machine
speech production and understanding. It will cover a wide range
of topics, both theoretical and applied, which should interest
researchers not only in computational linguistics, but also in
formal linguistics.
The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, re-
search monographs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of
high quality papers with clear unifying themes compiled under
the editorship of distinguished researchers.
The MIT Press publishes the ACL journal, Computational Lin-
guistics. The Press also has a strong list in formal linguistics and
publishes the journal Linguistic Inquiry.
Submissions for the ACL Series should be directed to one of the
Editors, or to Henry Bradford Stanton at The MIT Press

FOUNDATIONAL ISSUES IN NATURAL

<bodyText confidence="0.892109846153846">
edited by Peter Sells, Stuart M. Shieber, and Thomas
Wctsow
William Rounds, Avarind Joshi, Janet Fodor, and
Robert Berwick are leading scholars in the
multidisciplinary field of natural language processing.
In four separate essays they address the complex and
difficult connections among grammatical theory,
mathematical linguistics, and the operation of real
natural-language-processing systems, both human and
electronic. The editors&apos; subtantial introduction details
the progress and problems involved in attempts to
relate these four areas of research.

<bodyText confidence="0.98876025">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact,the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.925366">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984894095238095">
Paper: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Technical Correspondence: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results
of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Tech-
nical correspondence should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical
correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
Letters to the Editor: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.
The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for
inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language
processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the
Lexicon, Parsing, and Generation have been formed; others are likely to be added.

<abstract confidence="0.967271153846154">The ACL Series will offer books of high quality in the field of natural language processing, including human and machine speech production and understanding. It will cover a wide range of topics, both theoretical and applied, which should interest researchers not only in computational linguistics, but also in formal linguistics. The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, research monographs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of high quality papers with clear unifying themes compiled under the editorship of distinguished researchers. MIT Press publishes the ACL journal, Linguistics. The Press also has a strong list in formal linguistics and publishes the journal Linguistic Inquiry.</abstract>

<rawString>Cambridge, MA 02238, USA (+1 617) 491-1850; weischedel@bbn.com Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, and Generation have been formed; others are likely to be added.</rawString>
