Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894272727273">
This paper describes a prototype system for
near-real-time spontaneous, bidirectional
translation between spoken English and
Pashto, a language presenting many
technological challenges because of its lack of
resources, including both data and expert
knowledge. Development of the prototype is
ongoing, and we propose to demonstrate a
fully functional version which shows the basic
capabilities, though not yet their final depth
and breadth.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969607142857">
This demonstration will present a prototype system for
bidirectional speech-to-speech translation within a
limited semantic domain, that of first encounters
between a patient and a medical professional. A major
goal of the work is to explore techniques that are
appropriate for languages that are not of great
commercial interest and that consequently are lacking in
data and resources of many kinds. The system has been
developed for American English and Pashto, one of the
major languages of Afghanistan, which presents a
variety of challenges for both data-intensive and
knowledge-based approaches.
It should be noted that the system must be viewed as
one component in a real-time transaction between two
cooperating humans. The ultimate goal of those humans
is to exchange information by whatever means is
effective: not, necessarily, to rely exclusively on the
system’s output, but to use it in combination with other,
non-speech modalities of conveying meaning and with
ordinary world knowledge.
The final system is intended to run on a handheld
device, such as a PDA, with its attendant memory and
speed limitations and restriction to integer-only
computation. Most components of the demonstration
system run in a PocketPC emulation environment on a
Windows laptop, with a few in the full Windows
environment. All aspects of the prototype system are
undergoing active development.

2 Overall Architecture
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999652909090909">
A simple description of the architecture is as follows.
The system is controlled by the English speaker, who is
expected to have greater technological familiarity and
who has the benefit of visual feedback on the system
performance. Spoken input, in either English or Pashto,
is recognized by SRI’s small-footprint DynaSpeak®
recognizer, and an ordered list of hypotheses is
produced. The most likely hypothesis is input to SRI&apos;s
Gemini natural language parser/generator (Dowding et
al. 1993), which attempts to parse the speech
recognition output. Handling of possible errors or
failures will be discussed in Section 3.
When a successful parse is obtained, Gemini creates
a quasi-logical form representing the meaning of the
sentence. In general, multiple quasi-logical forms may
be created, reflecting differing interpretations of the
input sentence. These forms, which are domain
independent and serve here as an interlingua, can be
ordered by heuristically assigning preferences or
dispreferences to the parsing rules applied to create
them. Gemini uses a grammar for the target language to
generate a translation from the most-preferred
interpretation possible, and outputs a textual
representation of the translation.
Theta, a small-footprint concatenative synthesizer
from Cepstral LLC (Cepstral LLC 2004), then produces
synthetic spoken output in the target language from the
textual representation generated by Gemini. The Pashto
voice was created specifically for this project.
An English and a Pashto version of each component
are called by a single application which includes a
graphical user interface. A screen shot of the interface
is shown in Figure 1.

3 Redundancy and Handling Infelicities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99968635">
As in any complex system, performance can differ from
the ideal in a number of ways, and it is important for the
system to provide alternative ways to support successful
communication. Some kinds of subideal performance
and recovery approaches are described here.
The most likely hypothesis output by the speech
recognizer may not be exactly what was spoken. When
the input speech is English, the English speaker can see
whether the most likely hypothesis (shown in the
&amp;quot;Input&amp;quot; box in Figure 1) is correct or approximately
correct. If the English speaker judges the hypothesis to
not be close enough to the intended text, s/he may either
repeat the utterance or click on the &amp;quot;Guesses...&amp;quot; button
to see an ordered list of the best hypotheses. A sample
list is shown in Figure 2. If the correct text is on this list,
the user may select it to submit for translation. When
the input speech is in Pashto, this functionality is less
useful, as the Pashto speaker is not assumed to be able
to read, even if the hypotheses were displayed in Pashto
script.

hypotheses.

<bodyText confidence="0.979704071428572">
Once a recognition hypothesis has been submitted
for translation, several possible problems can arise.
Pashto is a moderately inflected, split-ergative Indo-
European language, and for Pashto in particular,
recognition errors may lead to apparent lack of syntactic
agreement between elements of the sentence which
should (and did in fact) agree. As Gemini tries to
generate a full parse of the input, it has the option of
using parse rules that relax agreement requirements.
These rules are dispreferred and a parse built upon them
may be kept only if a full, grammatically correct parse
cannot be completed. Another possible problem is that
unknown words, some grammatical constructions, and
input errors may render any full parse unachievable. In
this case, fallback strategies can be applied to translate
partial parses, fragments, or any known words. Other
strategies are currently in development.
Another class of approaches for assisting
communication allows the English speaker to quickly
perform certain actions or play high-frequency phrases
to the Pashto speaker. If there is background noise or
distractions or the TTS quality is not high enough for
easy comprehension, pressing the &amp;quot;Replay&amp;quot; button will
immediately play back the last translation result. &amp;quot;Ask
for Rep&amp;quot; plays a prerecorded sentence asking the Pashto
speaker to repeat what s/he said. Several other useful
phrases are available by clicking on the &amp;quot;Phrases...&amp;quot;
button and then selecting from the screen shown in

4 Sample Interaction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95307925">
The table below shows an excerpt of a dialog between
an English and a Pashto speaker, both new to this
system, whose interaction was part of an informal trial
run by the MITRE Corporation in February 2004 for the
DARPA CAST program. The English speaker, a doctor,
had just received eighteen minutes of training in how to
use the system and had had no other exposure to it. The
Pashto speaker, playing the role of an injured patient,
had received training in complaints consistent with a
particular injury scenario and had seen others use the
system, but had not interacted with the system himself.
Except as noted, the translations are understandable.

5 Challenges
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990230769231">
Three main challenges face this project. First,
commercially nonviable languages, such as Pashto,
often offer very few linguistic resources (such as
linguistic descriptions, acoustic data, texts, language
processing tools). The lack of resources makes
development more difficult, and severely constrains the
approaches that are viable: approaches that rely on large
corpora cannot be used. In addition, there is a shortage
of literate speakers who are available to act as
consultants, and a scarcity of basic knowledge about the
language. This impedes progress and renders difficult
approaches that rely on a large body of hand-crafted
translation rules. The challenge of having no single
person who has a deep understanding of both the
language and the technology and who can serve as a
bridge between them is substantial, and causes more
iterative development than is ordinarily the case when
bilingual technologists are available, as newly
discovered phenomena or new understanding cause
revisions of previous work.
A second major challenge is due to the nature of the
domain and the underlying concept of operations. Real
speech occurs in noisy environments, has disfluencies,
and is highly variable (e.g., phrasings, dialect
differences). In addition, the output of a speech
recognizer contains more and qualitatively different
errors than typical text input to automatic translation
systems. While the problems of real speech are not
unique to this project, they are magnified by the fact
that the non-English speakers will largely be
unsophisticated users of technology, who will often be
using the system for the first and only time. The system
must work well from the very first utterance – there
cannot be much of a learning curve. This applies to the
translation quality and to other aspects of the system,
such as the synthetic speech, as speakers are not familiar
with synthesized Pashto speech. These speakers are also
not expected to be literate, and their understanding will
not be bolstered by the extra redundancy and
capabilities that the display offers to the English
speaker.
A third major challenge is posed by the handheld
device platform with its computational and storage
limitations, and the near-real-time requirement of the
envisioned usage. The restriction to integer-only
computation is most serious for the speech recognition,
as nearly all medium- or large-vocabulary speech
recognizers perform extensive floating-point
computations, and the conversion of a speech recognizer
to use only integer computation required considerable
effort. The severe memory limitations perhaps impact
most the parsing/generation components of the system.

6 Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989454545455">
We have described a prototype of a spoken language
translation system for use by English-speaking medical
personnel treating Pashto-speaking patients. The
system, which is targeted to a handheld device, is being
developed with extremely little Pashto-language data of
any kind. It builds on medium-vocabulary speaker-
independent HMM-based speech recognition, rule-
based translation and supporting methods, and
concatenative synthesis. While the system is certainly
still under development, it has provided a reasonable
proof of concept in informal trials.
