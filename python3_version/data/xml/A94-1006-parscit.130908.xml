We propose a semi-automatic tool, ter-
might, that helps professional translators
and terminologists identify technical terms
and their translations. The tool makes
use of part-of-speech tagging and word-
alignment programs to extract candidate
terms and their translations. Although the
extraction programs are far from perfect,
it isn&apos;t too hard for the user to filter out
the wheat from the chaff. The extraction
algorithms emphasize completeness. Alter-
native proposals are likely to miss impor-
tant but infrequent terms/translations. To
reduce the burden on the user during the
filtering phase, candidates are presented in
a convenient order, along with some useful
concordance evidence, in an interface that
is designed to minimize keystrokes. Ter-
might is currently being used by the trans-
lators at AT&amp;T Business Translation Ser-
vices (formerly AT&amp;T Language Line Ser-
vices).

1 Terminology: An Application for
Natural Language Technology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999626307692308">
The statistical corpus-based renaissance in compu-
tational linguistics has produced a number of in-
teresting technologies, including part-of-speech tag-
ging and bilingual word alignment. Unfortunately,
these technologies are still not as widely deployed
in practical applications as they might be. Part-of-
speech taggers are used in a few applications, such
as speech synthesis (Sproat et al., 1992) and ques-
tion answering (Kupiec, 1993b). Word alignment is
newer, found only in a few places (Gale and Church,
1991a; Brown et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993). It
is used at IBM for estimating parameters of their
statistical machine translation prototype (Brown et

al., 1993). We suggest that part of speech tagging
and word alignment could have an important role in
glossary construction for translation.
Glossaries are extremely important for transla-
tion. How would Microsoft, or some other soft-
ware vendor, want the term &amp;quot;Character menu&amp;quot; to
be translated in their manuals? Technical terms are
difficult for translators because they are generally
not as familiar with the subject domain as either
the author of the source text or the reader of the
target text. In many cases, there may be a num-
ber of acceptable translations, but it is important
for the sake of consistency to standardize on a single
one. It would be unacceptable for a manual to use
a variety of synonyms for a particular menu or but-
ton. Customarily, translation houses make extensive
job-specific glossaries to ensure consistency and cor-
rectness of technical terminology for large jobs.
A glossary is a list of terms and their translations.&apos;
We will subdivide the task of constructing a glossary
into two subtasks: (1) generating a list of terms, and
(2) finding the translation equivalents. The first task
will be referred to as the monolingual task and the
second as the bilingual task.
How should a glossary be constructed? Transla-
tion schools teach their students to read as much
background material as possible in both the source
and target languages, an extremely time-consuming
process, as the introduction to Hann&apos;s (1992, P. 8)
text on technical translation indicates:
Contrary to popular opinion, the job of
a technical translator has little in com-
mon with other linguistic professions, such
as literature translation, foreign correspon-
dence or interpreting. Apart from an ex-
pert knowledge of both languages..., all
that is required for the latter professions is
a few general dictionaries, whereas a tech-
nical translator needs a whole library of
specialized dictionaries, encyclopedias and
&apos;The source and target fields are standard, though
many other fields can also be found, e.g., usage notes,
part of speech constraints, comments, etc.

technical literature in both languages; he
is more concerned with the exact meanings
of terms than with stylistic considerations
and his profession requires certain &apos;detec-
tive&apos; skills as well as linguistic and literary
ones. Beginners in this profession have an
especially hard time... This book attempts
to meet this requirement.
Unfortunately, the academic prescriptions are of-
ten too expensive for commercial practice. Transla-
tors need just-in-time glossaries. They cannot afford
to do a lot of background reading and &amp;quot;detective&amp;quot;
work when they are being paid by the word. They
need something more practical.
We propose a tool, termight, that automates some
of the more tedious and laborious aspects of termi-
nology research. The tool relies on part-of-speech
tagging and word-alignment technologies to extract
candidate terms and translations. It then sorts the
extracted candidates and presents them to the user
along with reference concordance lines, supporting
efficient construction of glossaries. The tool is cur-
rently being used by the translators at AT&amp;T Busi-
ness Translation Services (formerly AT&amp;T Language
Line Services).
Termight may prove useful in contexts other than
human-based translation. Primarily, it can sup-
port customization of machine translation (MT) lex-
icons to a new domain. In fact, the arguments for
constructing a job-specific glossary for human-based
translation may hold equally well for an MT-based
process, emphasizing the need for a productivity
tool. The monolingual component of termight can
be used to construct terminology lists in other ap-
plications, such as technical writing, book indexing,
hypertext linking, natural language interfaces, text
categorization and indexing in digital libraries and
information retrieval (Salton, 1988; Cherry, 1990;
Harding, 1982; Bourigault, 1992; Damerau, 1993),
while the bilingual component can be useful for in-
formation retrieval in multilingual text collections
(Landauer and Littman, 1990).

2 Monolingual Task: An Application

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.940359">
for Part-of-Speech Tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904975">
Although part-of-speech taggers have been around
for a while, there are relatively few practical appli-
cations of this technology. The monolingual task
appears to be an excellent candidate. As has been
noticed elsewhere (Bourigault, 1992; Justeson and
Katz, 1993), most technical terms can be found by
looking for multiword noun phrases that satisfy a
rather restricted set of syntactic patterns. We follow
Justeson and Katz (1993) who emphasize the impor-
tance of term frequency in selecting good candidate
terms. An expert terminologist can then skim the
list of candidates to weed out spurious candidates
and cliches.
Very simple procedures of this kind have been re-
markably successful. They can save an enormous
amount of time over the current practice of reading
the document to be translated, focusing on tables,
figures, index, table of contents and so on, and writ-
ing down terms that happen to catch the translator&apos;s
eye. This current practice is very laborious and runs
the risk of missing many important terms.
Termight uses a part of speech tagger (Church,
1988) to identify a list of candidate terms which is
then filtered by a manual pass. We have found,
however, that the manual pass dominates the cost
of the monolingual task, and consequently, we have
tried to design an interactive user interface (see Fig-
ure 1) that minimizes the burden on the expert ter-
minologist. The terminologist is presented with a
list of candidate terms, and corrects the list with
a minimum number of key strokes. The interface
is designed to make it easy for the expert to pull
up evidence from relevant concordance lines to help
identify incorrect candidates as well as terms that
are missing from the list. A single key-press copies
the current candidate term, or the content of any
marked emacs region, into the upper-left screen.
The candidates are sorted so that the better ones
are found near the top of the list, and so that re-
lated candidates appear near one another.

2.1 Candidate terms and associated
concordance lines
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851793103448">
Candidate terms. The list of candidate terms
contains both multi-word noun phrases and single
words. The multi-word terms match a small set of
syntactic patterns defined by regular expressions and
are found by searching a version of the document
tagged with parts of speech (Church, 1988). The
set of syntactic patterns is considered as a parame-
ter and can be adopted to a specific domain by the
user. Currently our patterns match only sequences
of nouns, which seem to yield the best hit rate in our
environment. Single-word candidates are defined by
taking the list of all words that occur in the docu-
ment and do not appear in a standard stop-list of
&amp;quot;noise&amp;quot; words.
Grouping and sorting of terms. The list of
candidate terms is sorted to group together all noun
phrase terms that have the same head word (as in
Figure 1), which is simply the last word of the term
for our current set of noun phrase patterns. The
order of the groups in the list is determined by de-
creasing frequency of the head word in the docu-
ment, which usually correlates with the likelihood
that this head word is used in technical terms.
Sorting within groups. Under each head word
the terms are sorted alphabetically according to re-
versed order of the words. Sorting in this order
reflects the order of modification in simple English
noun phrases and groups together terms that denote
different modifications of a more general term (see

Concordance lines. To decide whether a can-
didate term is indeed a term, and to identify multi-
word terms that are missing from the candidate list,
one must view relevant lines of the document. For
this purpose we present a concordance line for each
occurrence of a term (a text line centered around
the term). If, however, a term, ti, (like &apos;point&apos;) is
contained in a longer term, t2, (like &apos;insertion point&apos;
or &apos;decimal point&apos;) then occurrences of t2 are not
displayed for ti. This way, the occurrences of a gen-
eral term (or a head word) are classified into dis-
joint sets corresponding to more specific terms, leav-
ing only unclassified occurrences under the general
term. In the case of &apos;point&apos;, for example, five spe-
cific terms are identified that account for 61 occur-
rences of &apos;point&apos;, and accordingly, for 61 concordance
lines. Only 20 concordance lines are displayed for the
word &apos;point&apos; itself, and it is easy to identify in them
5 occurrences of the term &apos;starting point&apos;, which is
missing from the candidate list (because &apos;starting&apos;
is tagged as a verb). To facilitate scanning, con-
cordance lines are sorted so that all occurrences of
identical preceding contexts of the head word, like
&apos;starting&apos;, are grouped together. Since all the words
of the document, except for stop list words, appear
in the candidate list as single-word terms it is guar-
anteed that every term that was missed by the au-
tomatic procedure will appear in the concordance
lines.
In summary, our algorithm performs the following
steps:

Using the monolingual component, a terminologist
at AT&amp;T Business Translation Services constructs
terminology lists at the impressive rate of 150-200
terms per hour. For example, it took about 10 hours
to construct a list of 1700 terms extracted from a
300,000 word document. The tool has at least dou-
bled the rate of constructing terminology lists, which
was previously performed by simpler lexicographic
tools.

2.3 Comparison with related work

<bodyText confidence="0.999992222222222">
Alternative proposals are likely to miss important
but infrequent terms/translations such as &apos;Format
Disk dialog box&apos; and &apos;Label Disk dialog box&apos; which
occur just once. In particular, mutual information
(Church and Hanks, 1990; Wu and Su, 1993) and
other statistical methods such as (Smadja, 1993)
and frequency-based methods such as (Justeson and
Katz, 1993) exclude infrequent phrases because they
tend to introduce too much noise. We have found
that frequent head words are likely to generate a
number of terms, and are therefore more important
for the glossary (a &amp;quot;productivity&amp;quot; criterion). Con-
sider the frequent head word box. In the Microsoft
Windows manual, for example, almost any type of
box is a technical term. By sorting on the frequency
of the headword, we have been able to find many
infrequent terms, and have not had too much of
a problem with noise (at least for common head-
words).
Another characteristic of previous work is that
each candidate term is scored independently of other
terms. We score a group of related terms rather than
each term at a time. Future work may enhance our
simple head-word frequency score and may take into
account additional relationships between terms, in-
cluding common words in modifying positions.
Termight uses a part-of-speech tagger to identify
candidate noun phrases. Justeson and Katz (1993)
only consult a lexicon and consider all the possible
parts of speech of a word. In particular, every word
that can be a noun according to the lexicon is con-
sidered as a noun in each of its occurrences. Their
method thus yields some incorrect noun phrases that
will not be proposed by a tagger, but on the other
hand does not miss noun phrases that may be missed
due to tagging errors.

3 Bilingual Task: An Application for
Word Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999942">
3.1 Sentence and word alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999758723404256">
Bilingual alignment methods (Warwick et al., 1990;
Brown et al., 1991a; Brown et al., 1993; Gale and
Church, 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991a; Kay and
Roscheisen, 1993; Simard et al., 1992; Church, 1993;
Kupiec, 1993a; Matsumoto et al., 1993; Dagan et al.,
1993). have been used in statistical machine transla-
tion (Brown et al., 1990), terminology research and
translation aids (Isabelle, 1992; Ogden and Gonza-
les, 1993; van der Eijk, 1993), bilingual lexicography
(Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990; Smadja, 1992),
word-sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991b;
Gale et al., 1992) and information retrieval in a
multilingual environment (Landauer and Littman,
1990).
Most alignment work was concerned with align-
ment at the sentence level. Algorithms for the more
difficult task of word alignment were proposed in
(Gale and Church, 1991a; Brown et al., 1993; Da-
gan et al., 1993) and were applied for parameter es-
timation in the IBM statistical machine translation
system (Brown et al., 1993).
Previously translated texts provide a major source
of information about technical terms. As Isabelle
(1992) argues, &amp;quot;Existing translations contain more
solutions to more translation problems than any
other existing resource.&amp;quot; Even if other resources,
such as general technical dictionaries, are available it
is important to verify the translation of terms in pre-
viously translated documents of the same customer
(or domain) to ensure consistency across documents.
Several translation workstations provide sentence
alignment and allow the user to search interactively
for term translations in aligned archives (e.g. (Og-
den and Gonzales, 1993)). Some methods use sen-
tence alignment and additional statistics to find can-
didate translations of terms (Smadja, 1992; van der
Eijk, 1993).
We suggest that word level alignment is better
suitable for term translation. The bilingual compo-
nent of termight gets as input a list of source terms
and a bilingual corpus aligned at the word level. We
have been using the output of word_align, a robust
alignment program that proved useful for bilingual
concordancing of noisy texts (Dagan et al., 1993).
Word_align produces a partial mapping between the
words of the two texts, skipping words that cannot
be aligned at a given confidence level (see Figure 2).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986726">
3.2 Candidate translations and associated
concordance lines
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996412">
For each occurrence of a source term, termight iden-
tifies a candidate translation based on the alignment
of its words. The candidate translation is defined as
the sequence of words between the first and last tar-
get positions that are aligned with any of the words
of the source term. In the example of Figure 2 the
candidate translation of Optional Parameters box is
zone Parametres optionnels, since zone and option-
nels are the first and last French words that are
aligned with the words of the English term. Notice
that in this case the candidate translation is correct
even though the word Parameters is aligned incor-
rectly. In other cases alignment errors may lead to
an incorrect candidate translation for a specific oc-
currence of the term. It is quite likely, however, that
the correct translation, or at least a string that over-
laps with it, will be identified in some occurrences
of the term.
Termight collects the candidate translations from
all occurrences of a source term and sorts them in de-
creasing frequency order. The sorted list is presented
to the user, followed by bilingual concordances for all
occurrences of each candidate translation (see Fig-
ure 3). The user views the concordances to verify
correct candidates or to find translations that are

missing from the candidate list. The latter task
becomes especially easy when a candidate overlaps
with the correct translation, directing the attention
of the user to the concordance lines of this particular
candidate, which are likely to be aligned correctly.
A single key-stroke copies a verified candidate trans-
lation, or a translation identified as a marked emacs
region in a concordance line, into the appropriate
place in the glossary.

<bodyText confidence="0.999997888888889">
We evaluated the bilingual component of termight
in translating a glossary of 192 terms found in the
English and German versions of a technical manual.
The correct answer was often the first choice (40%)
or the second choice (7%) in the candidate list. For
the remaining 53% of the terms, the correct answer
was always somewhere in the concordances. Using
the interface, the glossary was translated at a rate
of about 100 terms per hour.

3.4 Related work and issues for future
research
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947128205128">
Smadja (1992) and van der Eijk (1993) describe term
translation methods that use bilingual texts that
were aligned at the sentence level. Their methods
find likely translations by computing statistics on
term cooccurrence within aligned sentences and se-
lecting source-target pairs with statistically signifi-
cant associations. We found that explicit word align-
ments enabled us to identify translations of infre-
quent terms that would not otherwise meet statisti-
cal significance criteria. If the words of a term occur
at least several times in the document (regardless of
the term frequency) then word_align is likely to align
them correctly and termight will identify the correct
translation. If only some of the words of a term are
frequent then termight is likely to identify a transla-
tion that overlaps with the correct one, directing the
user quickly to correctly aligned concordance lines.
Even if all the words of the term were not aligned
by word_align it is still likely that most concordance
lines are aligned correctly based on other words in
the near context.
Termight motivates future improvements in word
alignment quality that will increase recall and preci-
sion of the candidate list. In particular, taking into
account local syntactic structures and phrase bound-
aries will impose more restrictions on alignments of
complete terms.
Finally, termight can be extended for verifying
translation consistency at the proofreading (editing)
step of a translation job, after the document has
been translated. For example, in an English-German
document pair the tool identified the translation of
the term Controls menu as Menu Steuerung in 4 out
of 5 occurrences. In the fifth occurrence word_align
failed to align the term correctly because another
translation, Steuernienu, was uniquely used, violat-
ing the consistency requirement. Termight, or a sim-
ilar tool, can thus be helpful in identifying inconsis-
tent translations.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997722222222">
We have shown that terminology research provides
a good application for robust natural language tech-
nology, in particular for part-of-speech tagging and
word-alignment algorithms. Although the output of
these algorithms is far from perfect, it is possible to
extract from it useful information that is later cor-
rected and augmented by a user. Our extraction al-
gorithms emphasize completeness, and identify also
infrequent candidates that may not meet some of
the statistical significance criteria proposed in the
literature. To make the entire process efficient, how-
ever, it is necessary to analyze the user&apos;s work pro-
cess and provide interfaces that support it. In many
cases, improving the way information is presented
to the user may have a larger effect on productivity
than improvements in the underlying natural lan-
guage technology. In particular, we have found the
following to be very effective:

<listItem confidence="0.8627254">
• Grouping linguistically related terms, making it
easier to judge their validity.
• Sorting candidates such that the better ones are

• Providing quick access to relevant concordance
lines to help identify incorrect candidates as well
as terms or translations that are missing from
the candidate list.

The tool makes use of part-of-speech tagging and wordalignment programs to extract candidate terms and their translations. Although the extraction programs are far from perfect, it isn&apos;t too hard for the user to filter out the wheat from the chaff. The extraction algorithms emphasize completeness. Alternative proposals are likely to miss important but infrequent terms/translations. To reduce the burden on the user during the filtering phase, candidates are presented in a convenient order, along with some useful concordance evidence, in an interface that designed to minimize keystrokes.

Part-ofspeech taggers are used in a few applications, such as speech synthesis (Sproat et al., 1992) and question answering (Kupiec, 1993b).

Glossaries are extremely important for translation. How would Microsoft, or some other software vendor, want the term &amp;quot;Character menu&amp;quot; to be translated in their manuals? Technical terms are difficult for translators because they are generally not as familiar with the subject domain as either the author of the source text or the reader of the target text. In many cases, there may be a number of acceptable translations, but it is important for the sake of consistency to standardize on a single one. It would be unacceptable for a manual to use a variety of synonyms for a particular menu or button. Customarily, translation houses make extensive job-specific glossaries to ensure consistency and correctness of technical terminology for large jobs. A glossary is a list of terms and their translations.&apos; We will subdivide the task of constructing a glossary into two subtasks: (1) generating a list of terms, and (2) finding the translation equivalents. The first task will be referred to as the monolingual task and the second as the bilingual task. How should a glossary be constructed? Translation schools teach their students to read as much background material as possible in both the source and target languages, an extremely time-consuming</abstract>

Primarily, it can support customization of machine translation (MT) lexicons to a new domain. In fact, the arguments for constructing a job-specific glossary for human-based translation may hold equally well for an MT-based process, emphasizing the need for a productivity tool. The monolingual component of termight can be used to construct terminology lists in other applications, such as technical writing, book indexing, hypertext linking, natural language interfaces, text categorization and indexing in digital libraries and information retrieval (Salton, 1988; Cherry, 1990; Harding, 1982; Bourigault, 1992; Damerau, 1993), while the bilingual component can be useful for information retrieval in multilingual text collections (Landauer and Littman, 1990). 2 Monolingual Task: An Application for Part-of-Speech Tagging Although part-of-speech taggers have been around for a while, there are relatively few practical applications of this technology. The monolingual task appears to be an excellent candidate. As has been noticed elsewhere (Bourigault, 1992; Justeson and Katz, 1993), most technical terms can be found by looking for multiword noun phrases that satisfy a rat</context>

For example, it took about 10 hours to construct a list of 1700 terms extracted from a 300,000 word document. The tool has at least doubled the rate of constructing terminology lists, which was previously performed by simpler lexicographic tools. 36 2.3 Comparison with related work Alternative proposals are likely to miss important but infrequent terms/translations such as &apos;Format Disk dialog box&apos; and &apos;Label Disk dialog box&apos; which occur just once. In particular, mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990; Wu and Su, 1993) and other statistical methods such as (Smadja, 1993) and frequency-based methods such as (Justeson and Katz, 1993) exclude infrequent phrases because they tend to introduce too much noise. We have found that frequent head words are likely to generate a number of terms, and are therefore more important for the glossary (a &amp;quot;productivity&amp;quot; criterion). Consider the frequent head word box. In the Microsoft Windows manual, for example, almost any type of box is a technical term. By sorting on the frequency of the headword, we have been able to find many infrequent terms, and have n</context>

An expert terminologist can then skim the list of candidates to weed out spurious candidates and cliches. Very simple procedures of this kind have been remarkably successful. They can save an enormous amount of time over the current practice of reading the document to be translated, focusing on tables, figures, index, table of contents and so on, and writing down terms that happen to catch the translator&apos;s eye. This current practice is very laborious and runs the risk of missing many important terms. Termight uses a part of speech tagger (Church, 1988) to identify a list of candidate terms which is then filtered by a manual pass. We have found, however, that the manual pass dominates the cost of the monolingual task, and consequently, we have tried to design an interactive user interface (see Figure 1) that minimizes the burden on the expert terminologist. The terminologist is presented with a list of candidate terms, and corrects the list with a minimum number of key strokes. The interface is designed to make it easy for the expert to pull up evidence from relevant concordance lines to help identify incorrect candidates as well as terms th</context>

The candidates are sorted so that the better ones are found near the top of the list, and so that related candidates appear near one another. 2.1 Candidate terms and associated concordance lines Candidate terms. The list of candidate terms contains both multi-word noun phrases and single words. The multi-word terms match a small set of syntactic patterns defined by regular expressions and are found by searching a version of the document tagged with parts of speech (Church, 1988). The set of syntactic patterns is considered as a parameter and can be adopted to a specific domain by the user. Currently our patterns match only sequences of nouns, which seem to yield the best hit rate in our environment. Single-word candidates are defined by taking the list of all words that occur in the document and do not appear in a standard stop-list of &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot; words. Grouping and sorting of terms. The list of candidate terms is sorted to group together all noun phrase terms that have the same head word (as in Figure 1), which is simply the last word of the term for our current set of</context>

Most alignment work was concerned with alignment at the sentence level. Algorithms for the more difficult task of word alignment were proposed in (Gale and Church, 1991a; Brown et al., 1993; Dagan </context>

Some methods use sentence alignment and additional statistics to find candidate translations of terms (Smadja, 1992; van der Eijk, 1993). We suggest that word level alignment is better suitable for term translation. The bilingual component of termight gets as input a list of source terms and a bilingual corpus aligned at the word level. We have been using the output of word_align, a robust alignment program that proved useful for bilingual concordancing of noisy texts (Dagan et al., 1993). Word_align produces a partial mapping between the words of the two texts, skipping words that cannot be aligned at a given confidence level (see Figure 2). 3.2 Candidate translations and associated concordance lines For each occurrence of a source term, termight identifies a candidate translation based on the alignment of its words. The candidate translation is defined as the sequence of words between the first and last target positions that are aligned with any of the words of the source term. In the example of Figure 2 the candidate translation of Optional Parameters box is zone Parametres</context>

An expert terminologist can then skim the list of candidates to weed out spurious candidates and cliches. Very simple procedures of this kind have been remarkably successful.

In particular, mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990; Wu and Su, 1993) and other statistical methods such as (Smadja, 1993) and frequency-based methods such as (Justeson and Katz, 1993) exclude infrequent phrases because they tend to introduce too much noise. We have found that frequent head words are likely to generate a number of terms, and are therefore more important for the glossary (a &amp;quot;productivity&amp;quot; criterion). Consider the frequent head word box. In the Microsoft Windows manual, for example, almost any type of box is a technical term. By sorting on the frequency of the headword, we have been able to find many infrequent terms, and have not had too much of a problem with noise (at least for common headwords).

Several translation workstations provide sentence alignment and allow the user to search interactively for term translations in aligned archives (e.g. (Ogden and Gonzales, 1993)). Some methods use sentence alignment and additional statistics to find candidate translations of terms (Smadja, 1992; van der Eijk, 1993). We suggest that word level alignment is better suitable for term translation. The bilingual component of termight gets as input a list of source terms and a bilingual corpus aligned at the word level. We have been using the output of word_align, a robust alignment program that proved useful for bilingual concordancing of noisy texts (Dagan et al., 1993). Word_align produces a partial mapping between the words of the two texts, skipping words that cannot be aligned at a given confidence level (see Figure 2). 3.2 Candidate translations and associated concordance lines For </context>

The correct answer was often the first choice (40%) or the second choice (7%) in the candidate list. For the remaining 53% of the terms, the correct answer was always somewhere in the concordances. Using the interface, the glossary was translated at a rate of about 100 terms per hour. 3.4 Related work and issues for future research Smadja (1992) and van der Eijk (1993) describe term translation methods that use bilingual texts that were aligned at the sentence level. Their methods find likely translations by computing statistics on term cooccurrence within aligned sentences and selecting source-target pairs with statistically significant associations. We found that explicit word alignments enabled us to identify translations of infrequent terms that would not otherwise meet statistical significance criteria. If the words of a term occur at least several times in the document (regardless of the term frequency) then word_align is likel</context>

In particular, mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990; Wu and Su, 1993) and other statistical methods such as (Smadja, 1993) and frequency-based methods such as (Justeson and Katz, 1993) exclude infrequent phrases because they tend to introduce too much noise. We have found that frequent head words are likely to generate a number of terms, and are therefore more important for the glossary (a &amp;quot;productivity&amp;quot; criterion). Consider the frequent head word box. In the Microsoft Windows manual, for example, almost any type of box is a technical term. By sorting on the frequency of the headword, we have been able to find many infrequent terms, and have not had too much of a problem with noise (at least for common headwords)</context>
