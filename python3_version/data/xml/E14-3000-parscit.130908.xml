Welcome to the EACL 2014 Student Research Workshop.
This workshop continues the tradition of providing a forum for student researchers and builds on the
success of the previous workshops held in Bergen (1999), Toulouse (2001), Budapest (2003), Trento
(2006), Athens (2009), and Avignon (2012). It is an excellent venue for student researchers investigating
topics in computational linguistics and natural language processing to present and discuss their research,
to meet potential advisors and leading world experts in their research fields, as well as to receive feedback
from the international research community.
This year we have introduced two different types of submissions: research papers and thesis proposals.
Thesis proposals are intended for advanced students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to
get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for their continuing work, while research papers can
describe completed work or work in progress with preliminary results. All accepted research papers
are presented as talks in two separate sessions allocated for the workshop during the main EACL 2014
conference, while all accepted thesis proposals are presented as posters during the main EACL 2014
poster session.
On behalf of the entire Program Committee, we are delighted to present the proceedings of the Student
Research Workshop. We received 13 thesis proposals and 29 research papers. We accepted 5 thesis
proposals and 8 research papers leading to an acceptance rate of 38% for thesis proposals and 28% for
research papers. The overall quality of the submissions was high, and we thank our program committee
for their dedicated and thorough work and excellent feedback.
We also thank our faculty advisor Sebastian Padó for his suggestions, feedback and his extremely quick
responding to all our questions. We also thank the EACL 2014 organizing committee, especially Shuly
Wintner, Stefan Riezler, Sharon Goldwater, Nina Tahmasebi, Gosse Bouma and Yannick Parmentier, for
providing us advice and assistance in planning and organizing this workshop. We also want to thank the
EACL for providing financial support for students who would otherwise be unable to attend the workshop
and the conference.
We truly hope you will enjoy the Student Research Workshop in Gothenburg!
