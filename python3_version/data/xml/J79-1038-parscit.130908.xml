Summary of &amp;quot;Verb Paradigms for Sentence Recognition&amp;quot;
by
Marianne Celce-Murcia
Department of English, UCLA
This paper describes a linguistically-based recognition
grammar model, which was developed as part of a Computer-Aided
Instruction Project, to the tasks of recognizing and analyzin,g
a variety of basic sentence types in English. Ways of extending
the model to the analysis of complex sentences are also suggested.
The procedures and the model described herein are original,
however, they owe much to insights found in the work of two
linguists, Gruber and Fillmore.
The general problem of grammar recognition is that of
going from a surface string of words to a deep representatLon
that permits semantic interpretation. More specifically, our
grammar recognition ptocedure depends on the iaentification of
the precise function or semantic role that each noun phrase
actant occurring in a given sentence exhibits with respect to
the verb of that sentence.
By assigning verbs--or, to be more precise, verb senses--
to one or more paradigms (i.e., perceptually and functionally
defined surface configurations), it becomes possible to determine
algorithmically for every sentence the functional relation (e.g.,
theme, causal actant, goal, source, locus) that each noun phrase
in the sentence bears to the verb, thereby assisting greatly In
3
arriving at a representation of the meaning of each sentence.
A nUimber of verb paradigms such as intransitive, transitive
and ergative are defined. Verbs belonging to the intransitive
paradigm such as die, fall, go, etc. always have subjects that
function as themes. Verbs belonging to the transitive Raradigm
such as kill, read, eat, etc. have subjects that function as
Causal actants and objects that function as themes. The ergative
paradigm, which is more complex, consists of change-of-state
verbs such as open, melt, increase, etc. If an ergative para-
digm verb has both a subject and. an object, the subject is a
causal actant and the object is a theme; however; if such a
verb takes only a subject, then the subject functions as a theme.
The paradigm membership of each verb sense in the data base is
determined and is recorded as a lexical feature of that verb.
The number of verb paradigms would proliferate almost in-
definitely were it not for several devices, built into the grammar.
One of these devices is the reversal of transformations such as
passive and interrogative so that subject and object functional
relations remain the same as in active, declarative sentences
Another such device is the recovery of noun phrase deletions
such as the one occurring in a sentence like&amp;quot;John ate.&amp;quot; In
this case, an indefinite object is reconstructed and the
transitive paradigm feature of the verb eat remains tntact. A
third device of this nature is use of a notion called incorpor-
ation. For example, a sentence sdch as &amp;quot;It is raining.&amp;quot; will
be analyzed as having incorporated the theme subject rain&apos; into
4
the verb with the result that a more abstract structure resembring
&amp;quot;Rain is falling&amp;quot; gets reconstructed and processed as an in-
transitive verb paradigm item.
To overview the entire procedure, we start by paratng the
surface structure of any given sentence. The major constituents
and parts of speech&apos; are identified. Next, we determine the type
af sentence involved (i.e„ declarative, interrogative, imperative)
and transform the word order where necessary. Following that
the form of the verb (i.e., voice and tense) is identified and
again the word order is transformed if need be. A surface role
(t.e., subject, object) is then assigned to each noun phrase not
preceded by a preposition. At this time the lexical entry of
the verb is consulted for features of movement, deletion, in-
corporation, etc. so that any necessary final adjustments can
be made. The paradigm membership of the verb is then identified
thereby permitting a predetermined heuristic to assign a relation
(i.e., theme, causal actant, locative, etc.) Eo every noun phrase
in the sentence. Finally, by applying the above information as
well as other lexical and grammatical information the surface
structure is transformed ihto an appropriate abstract structure
that permits semantic interpretation

Force sponsored research at System Developmeftt Corporation in
the application of natural language processing tectniques to
computer-aided instructioA (CAI). The purpose of this research
was to increase the overall effectiveness of CAI as an instruc-
tional method, with particular emphasis on extending the student
computer interface to permit student-generated free form responses
and queries. The research included experiments with a deduc-
tive question-answering system designed for use In CAI, the
modeling of the behavior of a hypothetical tutor, and lastly
the computer evaluation of constructed student responses, and a
question-answering system driven by a dynamic model of the CAI
lesson content. The subject matter used in the project was
intreductory meteorology--specifically concepts relating to the
nature of precipitation.

One of the goals of this Computer-Aided Instruction Project
was the development of an efficient recognition grammar that is
as simple and realistic as possible without gacrificing infor-
mation critical to semantic interpretation The primary purpose
of this grammar was the analysis of student responses phrased
in natural English- a necessary step in the answer-evaluation
process. This paper describes in a general way the grammar re-
cognition model developed as part of the CAI Project.
The model developed was based on the assumption that recog-
nition grammars should be constructed quite differently from
production grammars (i.e., they are something other than mere
inverse algorithms of pr,oduction grammars and involve certain
questions of heuristics that are not of concern in the consttuct-
ion of production grammars); therefore an attempt was made to
develop a unique model specifically oriented to recognition tasks.1
1The author is not a computer programmer but an applied
linguist, who collaborated on a grammar recognition model for
the computer-aided instructiom project wieb a team of oomputer
programmers and specialists in artificial intelligence that in-
olWed William J. Schoene, John S. Brown and Robert F. Simmons,
and the author is greatly indebted to these colleagues for their
assistance. Questions concerning the details of actual programs
and routines implemented should therefore be addressed to one
of these specialists rather than the author, who served the pro-
ject in a not-technical capacity as a linguist.

At the time this CAI project was undertaken two of the mos.t
successful recognition grammars that had been constructed wern
the IBM &amp;quot;Automated Recognition Grammar for English,&amp;quot; of Guli-
cover, et al. (1969), and the work done at MIT on Project MAC,
which is described in Winograd (1971). The Culicover recognitio
grammar is based largely on the generative-transformational work
of Chomsky (1965) and others, and &apos;is a highly complex mechanism
that attempts ta capture the insights ot Chomsky&apos;s generative-
transformational model from the recognition grammar point of
view. Winograd&apos;s highly pragmatic recognition procedures, on
the other hand, make use of a systemic-type of grammar a la
Halliday (1961, 1966, 1967); however, the power of Winograd&apos;s
system is much more in his limited wor11-mode1 and semantic
networks than in his grammar.
Rather than produce an imitation c) either the IBM Recog-
nition Grammar or the MIT Project--it is, in fact, possible that
neither of these approaches will ultithately be the most useful
one for recognition purposes—we tried to reexamine recent
insights, especially Fillmore&apos;s Deep Case Hypothesis (1968b),
Chafe&apos;s semantically-based grammar (1970), and Gruber&apos;s work on
the Lexicon (1965, 1967) in order to see how the functions and
co-occurrence relations. they describe might best be incorporated
into a recognition grammar without sacrificing the positional
insights that much of Chomsky&apos;s work has made explicit. In
retrospect, our greatest debt was to Gruber (1965) This re
search was, of necessity, carrzed out somewhat independent of the
9
lingtistLc descriptions presented by these authors since they
typically endeavor to remain neutral with respect to questions
of production and recognitian in their work.

INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.997269529411765">
The problem we faced is, in general terms, the following:
Given (more or less) accurate parsings of students&apos; responses,
how do we, as simply as possible, automate the reconstruction of
deeper, more abstract message representations that permit us to
make reasonable semantic interpretations? This paper outlines
the essentials of our solution to this problem. The solution
is described in terms of the surface structures and deep rep-
resentations of simple sentences because it is easiest to under-
stand and evaluate the solution at this level. The final section
will discuss some complex sentence structures and will demon,-
strate that the paradigmatic technique discussed in this paper
can be extended quite naturally to bandle complex sentences as
well es simple sentences.
Given an utterance that is a simple English sentence, or part
of a simple English sentence, the grammar driving the parser must,
first of all, be capable of recognizing constituents such as
noun phrases, prepositional phrases, finite verbs or verb phrases,

ual auxiliaries, etc.

and adverbs or adverb phrases in this surface string of wrds.
The noun phrase preceding the verb phrase is referred to as the
surface subject; and if there is one noun phrase following the
verb, it is identified as the surface object. If two noun
phrases follow the verb phrase, there are two objects, identi-
fied as surfaceobjecti 4nd surface object2 respectively. The
verb phrase, plus whatever follows it in a simple sentence, has
tradidionally been referred to as thp predicate; we shmll be
making use of the term in this sense too; however, the notions
surface subjecp, surface verb phrase,&apos; and &apos;surface object(s)
are the notions that are most critical in the development of
our approach.

All noun phrases occurring in English sentences will be
viewed as actants that bear a specific functional relation to
the verb or element of predicatio in the sentence. These func-
tional relations (e.g.., theme, causal actant, locus, etc.) will
be discussed in the next:section of the paper. We view the
identification of the precise functions that all noun phrase
actants in a given sentence exhibit to their verb as the basic
problem of sentence recognition. English, more so than languages
such as German or Russian, tends to give relatively little direct
indication in surface structure as to what the function of a
11
given noun phrase in a sentence is. This is because noun phrases
occurring as surface subjects and surface objects--with the ex-
ception of some pronominal and interrogata.ve or relative norms--
are completely unmarked in English (i.e., chey bear no inflection
that would exclude or suggest a particular function). Thus
we may have a sentence with an unmarked noun ptrase as the sur
face subject:

12
passive) of the verb.
In cases such as these, where the only information we have
about the noun phrases in a sentence has to do with their serial
order, we say that the noun phrases are unmarked.
The surface subject of any English sentence is, by definition
always unmarked (i.e., it is not preceded by a preposition);
however, it is possible for the other noun phrase(s) in a sen-
tence all to be marked (i.e., preceded by a preposition) (5), or
for the non-subject noun phrase(s) to be a combination of marked
and unmarked noun phrases (6):
(5) The object descended to the ground.

From this point of view, most prepositional phrases are
analyzed as marked noun phrases In our grammar, and the lexical
shape of a preposition preceding the noun phrase usually gives us
some information as to what Eunction the following noun phrase is
fulfilling in the sentence. This information is of a different
order from the information stated in (4); however, we believe
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.825561">
13
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.980967478260869">
that it must be fully Lntegrated with such information if sep-
tences are to be meaningfully recognized.
At the surface leVel, then, we are interested in recognizing
unmarked noun phrased and marked noun phrases (i.e., noun
phrases preceded by prepositions); within the class of Unmarked
noun pAirases we also distinguish surface subjects from surface
objects in terms of their poSition with respect to the verb.
drid where two surface objects occur, we number them objecti
and object2 on a left-to-right basis. When marked noun phrases
occur, special attention iv given to the prepos.ition that pre-
cedes the noun phrase. The voice of the verb phrase of the
sentence is also recognized at the surface level. None of this
information, however, will directly constitute the deep represen-
ation of a sentence. Exactly how this surface-structure in-
formation will be used to arrive at accurate deep representations
will become clear in subsequent sections of the paper.
Func Relat ons. Elemen ar and Derived
The elementary funttional relations in our grammar are the following:
theme
causal actant
locus
goal
source

The thfeme3 is the most neutral actant and the one obligatory
actant in A simple sentence. It is the person thing, fact, or,
statE of affairs about which something is being predicated such
as movement, location, ownership (change of location or state
of ownership), class membership, etc.
The functional relation causal actant refers to the person,
object, natural forge, fact, or state of affairs etc., that
functions to cause or bring about the action, change., or situation
described or implied in the predicate. In addition, all nouns
that may function as the causal actant in a sentence are marked
in the lexicon with the feature (A-potent)--dirvctly or by re-
dundancy rules, following Chafe (1970). Not all sentences
will have a causal actant.
Where present, the locus4 is the object or being that the
3Theme is a syntactically and semantically defined functioftal
reldtion introduced by Gruber (1965). We follow Gruber&apos;s choice
of terminology and note that a similar functional relation was
referred to as the &apos;objective case&apos; by Fillmore (1968b) and
the &apos;neutral case&apos; by the UCLA English Syntax Project (1968)
4The functional relation locus includes under one category
the two tunctional relations that Fillmore and others have called
dative and locative. This is again more closely in line with
Gruber&apos;s analysis than with othar available analyses

theme is in, at, on, near, etc. Its use also implies that there
is no motion of the theme being expressed in the sentence
(ie., the functional relation &apos;locus&apos; typically occurs with
stative predicates).
The two other elementary functional relations that may in-
teract with themes, causal actants and loci are the directional
functional relations &apos;source&apos; and igoal&apos;5--the notion of source
often being marked by the use of the prepositions &apos;(away) froth&apos;
&apos;out of&apos;, and goal being expressed by the prepositions Ito(wards)
&apos;in(to)&apos;, and &apos;on(to)&apos;
The following six sentences give several examples showing
how marked and unmarked noun phrases can be reinterpreted as. one
of the five elementary functional relations defined aboye.

The basic types of sentences that we will discuss shortly
in terms of &apos;paradigms&apos; have, as a minimum requirement, one
noun phrase functioning as a theme; and at most, one occurrenc
of any of the five functional relations described above. In
other words, a simple or basic sentence type will not have two
noun phrases functioning as themes, or two noun phrases func-
tioning as causal actants, etc.
However, English has evolved a number of derived sentence
types where two occurrences ot: a given functional relation are
possible. Consider the followln&amp; sentences1

In sentences (13) through (15), the surface subjects, regard-
less of semantic differences, are functioning as causal actants
in our analysis. It is only in sentence (16) where two causal
actants occur, that it becomes necessary to distinguish two
kinds of causal actants: direct and indirect.6
Whenever two causal actants occur in an active sentence,
the unmarked one in subject position is the obligatorily anim-
ate, direct causal actant and the one marked by &apos;with&apos; that
occurs later in the sentence is the inanimate indirect causal
actant. In Fillmore (1968b) and other case-type grammars the
preposition &apos;with&apos; has often been analyzed as indicating the
instrumental case--which we have reanalyzed as marking an &apos;in-
direct causal actant.&apos; We feel that &apos;with&apos; does not indicate
dny given functional relation consistently; rather one of the
things &apos;with&apos; indicates is a derived sentence type having more
than one occurrence of a given functional relation. In (16)
&apos;with&apos; indicated an indirect causal actant. In sentence (17),
6Fillmore in his case grammar system distinguishes between
agentive. and instrumental causal actants. For our purposes, the
functional relation causal actant is sufficient--&apos;agent&apos; and
&apos;instrument&apos; being something close to,though not identical to,
what we describe as direct and indirect causal actants respectively
A given sentence may contain both types of causal actants--in
which case the direct causal actant is subject. If only one is
present, its direct or indirect status is irrelevant; it is
simply the causal actant subject of the sentence.
&apos;with&apos; indicates a co-theme, and in. (18) &apos;with&apos; indicates a
co-causal actant:
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.966187888888889">
Note that the co-theme in sentences such as (17) and the
co-causal actant in (18) must be semantically parallel to the
primary theme or causal actant with respect to humannes.s or
animacy. In sentences such as (19) where &apos;with marks a seman-
tically non-parallel theme, two sentences are always involved--
the surface object functioning simultaneously as the theme of
S1 and the locus of S2:
(19). Mary saw the man with the cane
Locus Theme Si theme S-2

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.819155">

The fact that two sentences are involved in (19) is reinforced
by a two-sentence paraphrase of sentences such as (20) first
suggested by Lees (1960):
(20) Mary saw the man who has the cane.
The error of assigning one semantic function to &apos;with&apos;
(or to most other prepositions for that matter) is further
emphasized by the ambiguity inherent in sentences such as the
following, which have been discussed in another context by
Hall (1965):
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.958430133333333">
In one tnterpretation, (21) means the detective used thc bur-
glar&apos;s body to break the window,&apos; in which case, the &apos;burglar&apos;
is functioning as an indirect causal actant. In the other in-
terpretation, (21) means &apos;the detective and the burglar broke
the window together,&apos; in which case &apos;the burglar&apos; is a co-
causal actant.
Obviously, a good deal of semantic information about the
verb as well as semantic information about the noun phrases
involved is needed in order to specify the exact role of a
nciun phrase following &apos;with.
Before moving on to the next section of the paper, some
remarks are in nrder as to why we use only one category &apos;locus
for what others may distinguish as &apos;dative&apos; and &apos;locative&apos; on
grounds of differences in animacy. Consider the following
sentences:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.4932488">
(22) John has a new car.

(23) New York has skyscrapers.

(24) John knows the answer.

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.996611">
Sentences like (22) and (23) show us that there is a deep funt-
tional similarity between so-called &apos;datives&apos; and &apos;locatives
which justifies treating them uniformly asIXoci in precisely
the way that &apos;agents&apos; and &apos;instruments&apos; were seen to function
similarly and were uniformly labeled as causal actants. Sentences
(24) and (25) illustrate that some verbs require a primary (i.e.,
mental) locus as the subject. This suggests that there is one
functionol category &apos;locust --hut that on occasion it is neces-
sary to distinguish primary (mental) loci from secondary (phys-
ical) loci.
In this presentation of our basic and derived functional
relations, we have tried to point out that there is no need to
posit many different functional relations in order to dis-
tinguish among the kinds of causal actant8, themes, loci, etc.
When and, where features of animacy, purposiveness, etc., raise
the need for distinguishing either primary loci (animate) from
other loci or direct causal actants (agents) from other causal
actants, the apparatus is available in the form of lexical fea-
tures of nouns.

In several of Fillmore&apos;s papers (see 1968a and 1968b) it Is
suggested that each English verb be assigned a &amp;quot;case frame&amp;quot; that
would indicate what functional actants occurred obligatorily and
optionally with a given verb. Translating from Fillmore&apos;s cases
21
it)to our functional relations, this would mean that the lexical
entry of verbs like die, open, and kill, would contain infor-
mation much as is representea in terms of the case frames shown in
(26), (27), and (28) respectively.

What these lexical entries mean&apos; is that die occurs only
with one obligatory actant &apos;theme&apos; (29). The verb&apos; open, like
die, has an obligatory theme (30a) but also an optional causal
actant (30b),which may even be realized as direct causal actant
plus an indirect causal actant (30c). The verb kill again has
the obligatory theme, but, in this case, the causal actant is
also obligatory (31a); there is also the possibility of expres-
sing the required causal actant as a direct causal plus an
indirect causal actant (31b).

While agreeing in spirit with Fillmore, we propose to take
the case frame suggestion one step further and make it more use-
ful in terms of grammar recognition. Since there are numerous
verbs that behave exactly like die, many others that behave exact-
ly like open,, and a good idmber of others that. behave like kill,
we propose to establish paradigms that summarize or recapitulate
the functional relations and syntactic and semantic featgres of
large classes of verbs. Then the only feature needed in the
lexicon would be a specification of which paradigm(s) a given
verb sense belorged to.
In other words, for verbs that are like die (i.e., require
a theme which occurs in surface subject position and do not per-
mit a causal actant), we establish the intransitive paradigm.
For recognition purposes, the paradigmatic feature intransitive
tells us that the surface subject is functioning as a theme, that
23
a causal actant is impossible, and that any other actant must
be marked by an appropriate preposition.
The verb kill, however, is a membet of. the transitive7
paradigm which requires both a theme and a caqsal actant.
7N ote the difference between our use of the terms tran-
sitive and intransitive and the traditional and generative
uses. In traditional terms, &apos;transitive&apos; means merely ths.t
a verb takes both a surface subject and a surface object; in
generative terms, &apos;transitive has meant that a verb is capable
of being passrvized. Im nur system. transitive means that a
verb takes a causal actant surface subject and theme surface
object in the active voice. We stress this distinction because
many of the verbs that allow: the passive transformation do not
have causal actant subjects in the active voice (e.g., Mary
daw the men/the men were seen by Mary.). This is why we stress
that our use of the term transitive to describe the behavior
of a particular verb paradigm is more specific and functionally
or4ented than other usages of the term. While it is true that
all of our (+transitive] verbs may occur in the passive as well
as the active voice, this fact is not a defining property of
(+transitive] verbs in our system but a redundancy rule of sorts,
Likewise, intransitive means not only that the verb takes a
surface subject and no unmarked surface object but that this
surface subject is functioning as a theme.
24
Furthermore, from the recognition point of view, we know that
for all verbs marked [-I-transitive] the surface subject is the
causal actant and the surface object is the theme IA the vvrti
is in the active voice.
A large class of verbs like open, belotg to what we refer
to as the ergative paradigm. &apos;Ergative18 is a surface struc-
ture typologic-al term long used by linguists to characterize the
grammar of those languages that seem to assign the same syntactic
role or case to both the subject NP of an intransitive verb and
the object NP of a transitive verb. (Two languages typically
described as ergative are Basque and Eskimo.) In the light of
this definition, the behavior of open and the other two verbs in
the examples below appear to be &apos;ergative:

We prefer this traditional term to Lakoff&apos;s rathet uncon-
ventional use of the term &apos;inchoative&apos; in his dissertation, The
Nature ()E. Syntactic Irregularity (1965), and elsewhere to de-
scribe similar phenomena.
25
What happens in these sentences is that if the causal actant
subject of the (a) examples is present, it is the surface subject;
and the surface object, which must also occur, is the theme.
If no causal actant is present, the surface subject is the theme
and there is no surface object. Also the verb in an aptive.
declarative English sentence must, as a rule, come second.
Thus if there is no causal actant present filling the subject
slot, the theme (or a noun phrase bearing some other functional
relation) must fill the subject slot.
There are tany ergative paradigm9 verbs in English. In
particular, the vocabulary of the meteorology lessons that our
project was centrally concerned with contains many verbs belong-
ing to this ergative paradigm (e.g., move, (re)distribute, re-
duce, relate, replace, skew, slant, spread (throughout), start,
stop, decrease, transfer (in)to, weaken, break(up), boil, begin,
dry (out), dissolve, decompose, divide (into), condense, form
(out of), etc.).
9Some readers will question the need for an ergative para-
digm and suggest that each such verb be assigned to both the
intransitive and transitive paradigms. However, both the
economy gained by stating just one paradigmatic feature for verbs
like open and the apparatus which then permits us to explain
the relationship between raise/rose, kill/die at suppletive
ergative forms convinces us that this paradigm feature is
extremely useful if not necessary.
26
The above ergative paradigm verbs retain the same lexical
shape whether or not a causal actant is present in suhiect po-
sition. However, there are also a large number of pairs of
transitive-intransitive verbs that, by virtue oS their semantic
(and sometimes phonological or orthographical)similarity, should,
perhaps bc c sified as suppletive members of an ergative verb
pair. The transitive member of the pair occurs when a causal
extant i present; the intransitive member occur&apos;s when no causal
actant is present. For example:

<bodyText confidence="0.851151">
The full ergative paradigm of some verbs contains a stative
level as well as the two nonstative levels we have been discuss-
ing:

them being tha stative vs. the nonstative nature of the verb
phrase. This diffdrence sometimes has no effect on the surface
for% of the verb in irregular cases such as (37c), but it is
more generally the case that a different surfaoe form occurs
(e.g., dead of (380)-the regularly different form being not a
lexically related adjective like dead but a past participle
(e.g., the door is closed). The (a) sentences above contain what
CAafe (1970) wills activity predicates, the (b) sentences process
predicates, and the (c) sentences stative predicates.
GrUber (1965) has discussed transfer verbs at length, and
based on his discussion we have found it desirable to establish
three transfer paradigms. First of all, there are the two-way
transfer verbs which allow overt expression of both a source and
a goal:

Secondly, there are source-subject transfer paradigms which per-
mit goals but not sources to be overtly stated in the predicate
since the subject is the source of the transfer.

Thirdly, we also have the goal-subject transfer paradigm which
permits sourcds but not goals to Izie ilitectly stated in the
predicate, and the subject is the goal of the transfer since a
from phrase is implicitly or explicitly expressed.

put/tae paradigm that includes additive verbs like put in(to)/

In this paradigm virtually all of the verbs can be used in con-
junction with either galls or sources—denoting the theme&apos;s coming
to or going from a locus respectively. The preposition makes
clear which case is intended. A few of these verbs even permit
the expression of both source and goat in the predicate, and
these verbs form a separate two-way put/take paradigm (44):

There is another paradigm for verbs like &apos;have&apos; which re-
quire a locus as surface subject and a theme in object position
(45):
tas

A paradigm for the converse of (45) includes verbs such as
&apos;occupy which have surface suuject themes and take loci in
surface object position (46):

<bodyText confidence="0.91029">
There are geveral other possible paradigms which will not be
mentioned and illustrated here. The point we want to make is
that large numbers of verb senses can be classified in a way
that facilitates recognition: the semantic function of surface
subjects and objects of verbs can be easily ascertained by ref-
erence to a paradigmatic feature on the verb.

to refer to languages that treat the subject of an intransitive
verb and the subject of a transitive verb with the same inflec-

grammar the accusative case generally corresponds closely to
our notion of a surface object in English. We have borrowed
this term and are using it to specify a particular type of
deletion that occurs. in English.

reconstructed if all the functional relations expressed in the
sentence are to be explicitly staked in the deep structure.
Other examples of verbs with potential accusative deletion in
the data are: conduct, evaluate, gain, lose, observe, read, re-
call, understand, consume, etc.
Another type of transformational deletion occurs with vir-
tually all motional verbs such as run, move, stir, walk, lump,
etc., whenever the surface subject of such verb is [+ animate].

Theme and C.A
The sentences in (49) which have inanimate surface subjects con-
form perfectly to the intransitive variant of the ergative para-
digm discussed previously (i.e., the surface subject functions
as the Theme) The sentences in (50), however, are somehow dif-
ferent in that the surface subject is not only functioning as a
theme but also as a causal actant since no external causal ac-
tant has been explicitly mentioned. We can roughly paraphrase
this type of sentence as follows:
(51) a. John caused himself to run.
b. The cat caused itself to move.

(49), we assume that a reflexive&apos; deletion takes place in sen-
ttnces with transitive-paradigm verbs of motion or verbs of
self-oriented habit (e.g., wash, dress, shave, etc.) When an
animate surface subject functions both as the causal actant and
the theme of the Pi-transitive] variant of an ergative verb; then
the coreferential theme/causal actant is not stated twice in the
surface structure if the verb may undergo reflexive deletion.11
The accusative and reflexive deletions discussed above help
to explain an interesting ambiguity that occurs in sentences
such as (52):

Since the transitive paradigm verb wash will be marked in the
lexicon as additionally permitting either the accusative dele-
tion or the reflexive deletion, the two ambiguous readings of
(51) given in (52) will be automatically predicted by the re-
cognition grammar since the accusative deletion rule will re-
copstruct (52a) and the reflexive deletion rule (52b).
In addition to deletions, the grammar recognizes and effec-
tively &apos;reverses various movement transformations or permutations
that may have operated to produce the surface structure of cer-
tain sentences.
A well-known movement transformatibn is the passive trans-
formation which operates on a sentence such as (53) and produces
(54):
(53) Dick purchased the car yesterday,
(54) The car was purchased yesterday by Dick.
A subsequent transformation may optionally delete the &apos;by&apos; phrase
in (54) yielding (55).
(55) The car was purchased yesterday.
Given a sentence such as (54) our rules will &apos;reverse&apos; the pas-
sive transformation and yield (53). Given 4 sentence such as
(55) our rules will reverse the passive transformation and pro-
duce an active structure similar to (56).

<bodyText confidence="0.92391308">
The procedure seems simple enough yet thexe are many prob-
lems involved in the accurate recognition and reversal of pas-
sive sentences First of all, not all &apos;by&apos; phrases co-occurring
with a passive verb can be reanalyzed as the surface subject of
the corresponding active sentence:
I:. by John.
(57) The rations were increased b. by the sea.
c. by noon.
by 50
Of the above four &apos;by&apos; phrases, only (a) could function as sur-
face subject in the active voice version of (57); semantic
features are needed to determine whether the noun object in a
&apos;by&apos; phrase is a causal actant, a location, a time, or a measure-
ment. In our lexicon John is [+potent], sea is f+stationaryl,
noon is [+time] and percent is [+unit]12 such features will allow
our passive reversal rule to construct a reasonable active voice
variant for all the passive sentences in (57).
Another problem in passive reversal concerns the verbs in
the various transfer paradigms. For several of these verbs most
speakers of English recognize two different passive permutations
(i.e., (59) and (60)) of the same active sentence (58):
Active (58) John gave Mary the book.

and surface objects of the passive sentences is required if the
&apos;theme&apos; and the &apos;goal&apos; are to be properly labe/ed in the deep
structure. In such cases the fallowing feature hierarchy--or
something like it--seems to operate:
human
animate
(el) stationary
concrete
abstract
The two nouns involved as &apos;goal&apos; and &apos;theme&apos; seldom are at the
same level on the hierarchy in terms of their lexical features,
and the one that is higher than the other is always the goal.
Thus in (59) and (60)--irrespective of the surface order in the
passive--&apos;Mary&apos; is analyzed as goal and &apos;the book as themE.
Some readers no doubt may wonder why we have bothered to
36
write rules that depassivize13 sentences. The answer is that
we wish to get optimum efficiency and accuracy out of our para-
digms without indefinitely proliferating their number. The
paradigms are set up to assign functional relations to the
marked and unmarked noun phrases occurring in active declarative
structures. By first reversing the results of deletton trans-
formations, question transformations and other movement trans-
formations (e.g. passive), we are able to use a minimum number
of paradigms to assign accurate functional labels to all of the
noun phrases in a sentence.
The paradigms for transfer verbs just discussed above with
respect to the passive transformation are also involved in
another movement transformation which we refer to as &apos;goal focus&apos;
13We are for the moment ignoring potential ambiguities and
changes of meaning caused by changes of quantifier ordering in
active and passive sentences such as those which Chomsky has
pointed out (1965).
e.g. (1) Everyone in the room speaks two languages.
(can be interpreted as being different languages
for each person)
(2) Two languages are spoken by everyone in the room.
ttends to be interpreted as two spetific languages
that everyone speaks)
37
To explain this transformation We must first establish the
difference between immediate sources and goals on the one hand,
and remote sources and goals on the other. With verbs of trans-
fer iv the active voice, the surface subject is a source, goal,
or causal secant, The theme is the surface object. Other
aspects of the motion or transfer are usually implied. The
following examples illustrate this:
</bodyText>

Verbs like &apos;buy&apos; (e.g., get, obtain, acquire, fetch, borrow,
etc..) and verbs like &apos;sell&apos; (e.g., teach, serve, donate, give,
lend, etc.) have an immediate goal and an immediate source in
subject position respectively. In addition, they my express
a remote goal or a remote source, both of which get marked with
the preposition &amp;quot;for &amp;quot; The following examples show that, if
the subject embodies the function &amp;quot;source,&amp;quot; the optional &amp;quot;for&amp;quot;
phrase will also embody (remoteTy) the function of source. If
the subject expresses the function &amp;quot;goal, then the optional
&amp;quot;foe phrase may express (remotely) either the function &amp;quot;goal&amp;quot;
or the function &amp;quot;source.&amp;quot;

Transfer verbs like &apos;bring&apos; that express a causal actant

ambiguous when occurring with an optional &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; phrase unless
it is clear from the context that the causal actant is func-
tioning on behalf of axemote source or for the benefit of a
remote goal.

Our grammar makes use of several other deletion and move-
ment reversing transformations that will not be discussed here.
What we have tried to illustrate in this section of the paper
is that both paradigms and transformations are useful components
in a recognition grammar.
15We have reason to believe that an objeotivalization move-
ment rule like &apos;Go%1 Focus&apos; in EngUsh is also widely used in
other languages. French, for example, appears to have a move-
ment operation even more general than the goal-restricted
objectivalization transformation of English. It is for this
reason that speakers of French say sentences such as &amp;quot;Open me
the door&amp;quot; when speaking English. English does not permit the
movement of &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; to object position in this sentence because
&amp;quot;me&amp;quot; is a remote causal actant or source and not a remote goal
in &amp;quot;Open the door for me.&amp;quot; In this sentence &amp;quot;(you)&amp;quot; is the
immediate causal actant and source and the verb &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; belongs
to the ergative paradigm and not to the movement-transfer class
of verbs. Thus the rules of English do not permit &amp;quot;Goal Focus&amp;quot;
movement to apply in such a case.

Par4digms and Aspect
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970846047619048">
In the course of the development of this recognition gram-
mar we noted that completive aspect (i.e., inference of com-
pletion vs. no inference of completion) sometimes serves to
4iitinguish highly similar verb paradigms In such cases, both
the lekical shape of the verbs and the prepositions, as well as
the order of actants in the surface structure, play a role in
signaling the presence of completive aspect. Recall the para-
digm for verbs of putting and taking (71) discussed earlier in
the paper:
(71) a. John put water in the pool.
C.A. [-completive] Miiiie Goal
b. Mary took the groceries out of the bag.
C.A. [-comp/etive] Theme source
Note that the verbs of the sentences in (71) are not marked
as having completive aspect: one cannot infer that the pool in
(71a) is full of water nor that &apos;the bag&apos; in (71b) is empty of
groceries. There is, however, another paradigm similar to the
put-take&apos; paradigm but different from it in that all of its
verbs indicate completive aspect. We refer to this [+completive]
paradigm as the &apos;join-separate&apos; paradigm (72), which is the para-
digit to which the verbs fill and empty, for example, belong.

The sentences.in (72)--unlike those in (71)--do allow us
to infer that &apos;the pool&apos; in (72a) is full and that &apos;the bag&apos; in
(72b) is empty This is because_verbs of joining--which mark
their theme with the preposition &apos;with!--and verbs of separating-
which mark their theme with &apos;of&apos;--are always [4-completive]
Other examples of j6ining verbs are: fill, supply, provide,
stock, cover, present, furnish, plant, smear, sprinkle, etc.
Additional examples of separating verbs are: relieve, empty,
rob, deprive, withhold, rid, clear, drain, deplete, etc.
Some English verbs--as well as &apos;living used to express the
completive notions of joining and separation—may also be used
to express non-completive activities such as putting or taking.
This dual function of the verbs has been the source of much
confusion and unsatisfactory analysis, and is a topic we should,
therefore, like to pursue. in some detail. In gall (1965), for
example, the following sentences were considered more or less
equivalent and thus relatable via a transformational rule which
considered the object paint in (73) as basic and the object
wall&apos; in (74) as derived:
(73) John smeared paint on the wall.
(74) John smeared the wall with paint.
Fillmore (1968b, p. 48) explained these sentences by
suggesting that both &apos;wall&apos; and &apos;paint&apos; were originally supplied
with prepositions reflecting the locative and instrumental cases
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.554734">

<bodyText confidence="0.968993428571429">
respectively. This yields &apos;on the gall&apos; and &apos;with paint&apos; in the
deep structure. Fillmore then analyzed the verb smear as having
the following property: whichever of the two deep structure
elements concerned is chosen as the &apos;direct obj&apos;ect&apos;, it must
fall next to the verb and must lose its preposition.
While more or less agreeing with Hall&apos;s intuition that
&apos;paint&apos; is a basic &apos;objece--in our system &apos;theme&apos;,-in (73) and
a derived&apos;object&apos; or displaced theme in (74), we disagree with
her implicit assumption that sentences such as (73) and (74) are
syntactically or semantically equivalent or the explicit pro-
posal that they should be related by a transformational rule,
We also disagree with Fillmore&apos;s decision to analyze &apos;with&apos; in
sentences such as (74) as an instance of the instrumental case.
In our view, aspectual differences between (73) and (74) call
for a different assignment of deep structure functional relations
and necessitate the postulation of distinct paradigms. In our
analysis the surface object of (73) is a theme; the verb &amp;quot;smear&amp;quot;
expresses an activity similar to &amp;quot;putting&amp;quot; in (73) and &apos;the wall
is the goal of the theme &apos;paint&apos;. In (74) &apos;smear&apos; is being used
to express the completed joining of a displaced theme--i.e.,
&apos;paint&apos;--to the locus--i.e., &apos;wall&apos;. In other words. our Bug.-
ution will analyze verbs such as &apos;smear&apos; as belonging to two
diiferent paradigms. In one of the paradigms, &apos;smear&apos; behaves
like &apos;put&apos; and in the other it expreoses joining of a location
and a theme. In this latter sense, the displaced theme is
44
expressed optionally, though always implied as something present
but unspecified if not overtly expressed:

<bodyText confidence="0.990373647058823">
b*. John filled the gJass. (Implicit: with sftething)
Ln the non-completive sense of &apos;smear&apos; where &apos;wall&apos; fuactions as
goal, this &apos;goal&apos; element is obligatorily expressed and not
deletable. .,

<bodyText confidence="0.991630666666667">
These sentences in (80) force us to infer that the theme has
made contact with the locus; no other interpretation is possible,
In the two sets of paradigms discussed above, some unusual
phenomena have ta14en place. In those cases where the verb
signals completive action, the surface order of actants in
active surfaces is as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.820617357142857">
Surface Surface
(81) Subject Object Marked NP
VP +. NP + Prep + NP
[+completive]
C.A. Locus Theme
46
This is not the normal order of elements,. The usual surface
order for active sentences containing a causal actant, a theme,
and a locus is the following:
Surface Surface
Subject Object
(82) NP + VP + NP + Prep + NP
lirlip r 4 ,
Theme i.emi,s
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.936393724137931">
Thus is appears that we get completive aspect only when a locus
occurs in the position where one would normally expect the theme
to occur.
This hypothesis is confirmed by a completive pa/adigm with
no unmarked surface objects that has a locus in subject position
instead of a theme (83). This paradigm is similar to the non-
completive paradigm which has the theme in subject position
(84) and follows the normal order of constituents for sentences
having only a theme and a locative actant:
(83) The garden is swarming with bees.
Locus p-completive] Theme
(84) Bees are swarming in the garden.
Theme (-completive] Ldcus
The meanings of these sentences have been debated by Fill-
more (1968b) and Chomsky (1972), among others. Fillmore assigns
the same case representation to (83) and (S4) suggesting that
there is a difference of focus with perhaps some corresponding
difference in cognitive content Chomsky points out that the
47
sentences are not synonymous--that in (83) the bees are neces-
sarily all over the garden but that in (84) the bees might be
only around their hive. In light of our analyses of sentences
(71)-(80) we suggest that both Fillmore&apos;s remarks and Chomsky&apos;s
remarks are correct but incomplete. The functional relations
exhibited by the noun phrases in (83) and (84) are the same,
the verb aspect is different. This suggests that there are two
paradigms involved: a completive paradigm accounting for (83) and
(85), and a non-completive paradigm accounting for sentence (84)
and similar sentences ltke (86):
</bodyText>

b. The stream teems with fish.
c. The bag bulged with groceries.

<bodyText confidence="0.892227833333333">
With lexically diffbrent verbs and prepositions as in (85)
and (86) the two paradigms are easily distinguishable. When
there is lexical overlap in different verb senses as in (83) and
(84), the prepositions as well as semantic features will serve
to distinguish (+completive] paradigms from [-completive] paradigms

Paradigms and Incorporation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999255769230769">
In the second section of Gruber (1965: 5-27) there is a
discussion of the grammatical process of incorporation. The
term incorporation has been used most frequently by linguists
working on American Indian languages; however, Gruber&apos;s discus.
sion of incorporation along with the following discussion of cer-
tain paradigms supports the position that the concept of incor-
poration is needed to describe in full generality certain lexical
and grammatical facts about English.
Gruber discusses verbs that obligatorily or optionally in-
corporate certain adverbs or precositions. For example, Gruber
claims that the verb cross obligatorily incorporates the adverb
across. He illustrates this with paraphrase relations in accept
able sentences such as the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.90440275">
(87) John crossed the street.
(88) John went across the street.
Note also that the sentence below is impossible:
(89) *John crossed across the street.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7232712">
The lexical and grammatical facts cannot be explained with maxi-
mum generality unless the verb cross is analyzed as a motional
verb similar to Elp_ yet alsa incorporating the adverb across.
Another example of incorporation that Gruber provides con-
cerns verbs co-occurring with the preposition for. The verb
want obligatorily requires and incorporate% for, while the verb
49
yearn requires but never incorporates for. The verb wish, how-
ever, requires for 4nd allows both possibilities (i.e., incor-
poration of for is optional), Gruber&apos;s examples illustrate this:
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.9762425">
(90) a. John wants a book.
b. *John wants for a book;
c. *John yearns a book.
d. John yearns for a book.
e. John wishes a book.
d. John wished for a book.
</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.887047666666667">
These verb-preposition co-occurrences would be very difficult to
explain economically without making referedice to the notion of
incorporation.
Likewise, in setting up the paradigms needed to account
for a large number of verbs in English we realized that certain
verbs could be best described as belonging to a particular para-
digm but, in addition, incorporating a specific noun actant.
For example, the paradigm describing source-subject transfer
verbs like give, send, sell, etc. can also include verbs like
help, aid, Support, etc. if we recognize that such verbs incor-
porate the theme but are otherwise exactly like the source-
subject transfer paradigm:

The fact that these incorporating verbs can be paraphrased as

<bodyText confidence="0.907138">
The theme is not the&apos; only actant that may be incorporated.
Another such example of incorporation is found in verbs such as
map, chart, graph, stratify, etc,. which resemble two-way trans-
fer verbs like bring, trans,fer, take etc. except that the goal
actant has been incorporatdd in the verb Thus we have the
regular two-way transfer paradigm:

<abstract confidence="0.991251457142857">This paper describes a linguistically-based recognition grammar model, which was developed as part of a Computer-Aided Instruction Project, to the tasks of recognizing and analyzin,g a variety of basic sentence types in English. Ways of extending the model to the analysis of complex sentences are also suggested. The procedures and the model described herein are original, however, they owe much to insights found in the work of two linguists, Gruber and Fillmore. The general problem of grammar recognition is that of going from a surface string of words to a deep representatLon that permits semantic interpretation. More specifically, our grammar recognition ptocedure depends on the iaentification of the precise function or semantic role that each noun phrase actant occurring in a given sentence exhibits with respect to the verb of that sentence. By assigning verbs--or, to be more precise, verb senses-to one or more paradigms (i.e., perceptually and functionally defined surface configurations), it becomes possible to determine for every functional relation (e.g., theme, causal actant, goal, source, locus) that each noun phrase the sentence bears to the assisting greatly In 3 arriving at a representation of the meaning of each sentence. nUimber of verb paradigms such as transitive ergativeare defined. Verbs belonging to the intransitive such as die, fall, always have subjects that as themes.Verbs belonging to the transitive Raradigm such as kill, read, eat, etc. have subjects that function as actantsand objects that function as themes. The ergative paradigm, which is more complex, consists of change-of-state such as open,melt, increase,etc. If an ergative paradigm verb has both a subject and. an object, the subject is a causal actant and the object is a theme; however; if such a verb takes only a subject, then the subject functions as a theme. The paradigm membership of each verb sense in the data base is determined and is recorded as a lexical feature of that verb. The number of verb paradigms would proliferate almost indefinitely were it not for several devices, built into the grammar. One of these devices is the reversal of transformations such as passive and interrogative so that subject and object functional relations remain the same as in active, declarative sentences such device is the of noun phrase deletions such as the one occurring in a sentence like&amp;quot;John ate.&amp;quot; In case, an indefinite object is and the paradigm feature of the eat remains tntact. A device of this nature is use of a notion called incorporation. For example, a sentence sdch as &amp;quot;It is raining.&amp;quot; will be analyzed as having incorporated the theme subject rain&apos; into 4 the verb with the result that a more abstract structure resembring &amp;quot;Rain is falling&amp;quot; gets reconstructed and processed as an intransitive verb paradigm item. To overview the entire procedure, we start by paratng the surface structure of any given sentence. The major constituents parts of speech&apos; are identified. determine the type af sentence involved (i.e„ declarative, interrogative, imperative) and transform the word order where necessary. Following that the form of the verb (i.e., voice and tense) is identified and the word order is transformed if need be. surface role subject, object) is then assigned to noun phrase not preceded by a preposition. At this time the lexical entry of verb is consulted for features movement, deletion, inetc. so that any necessary final can be made. The paradigm membership of the verb is then identified thereby permitting a predetermined heuristic to assign a relation theme, causal actant, locative, etc.) noun phrase the sentence. Finally, by applying information as well as other lexical and grammatical information the surface transformed appropriate structure that permits semantic interpretation</abstract>
