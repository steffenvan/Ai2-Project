In machine translation and man-machine dialogue,
it is important to clarify referents of noun phrases.
We present a method for determining the referents
of noun phrases in Japanese sentences by using the
referential properties, modifiers, and possessors&apos; of
noun phrases. Since the Japanese language has
no articles, it is difficult to decide whether a noun
phrase has an antecedent or not. We had previously
estimated the referential properties of noun phrases
that correspond to articles by using clue words in
the sentences (Murata and Nagao 1993). By using
these referential properties, our system determined
the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences.
Furthermore we used the modifiers and possessors
of noun phrases in determining the referents of noun
phrases. As a result, on training sentences we ob-
tained a precision rate of 82% and a recall rate of
85% in the determination of the referents of noun
phrases that have antecedents. On test sentences,
we obtained a precision rate of 79% and a recall rate
of 77%.

This paper describes the determination of the ref-
erent of a noun phrase in Japanese sentences. In
machine translation, it is important to clarify the
referents of noun phrases. For example, since the
two &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man)&amp;quot; in the following sentences
have the same referent, the second &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old
man)&amp;quot; should be pronominalized in the translation
into English.
OJIISAN-WA JIMEN-NI KOSHI-WO-OROSHITA.
(old man) (ground) (sit down)
(The old man sat down on the ground.)
l&apos;AGATE OJIISAN-WA NEMUTTE-SHIMATTA.
(soon) (old man) (fall asleep)
(He (= the old man) soon fell asleep.)
(1)
When dealing with a situation like this, it is neces-
sary for a machine translation system to recognize
that the two &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man)&amp;quot; have the same
referent. In this paper, we propose a method that
determines the referents of noun phrases by using
(1) the referential properties of noun phrases, (2) the
modifiers in noun phrases, and (3) the possessors of
entities denoted by the noun phrases.
The possessor of a noun phrase is defined as the entity
which is the owner of the entity denoted by the noun phrase.

For languages that have articles, like English, we
can use articles (&amp;quot;the&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, and so on) to decide
whether a noun phrase has an antecedent or not.
In contrast, for languages that have no articles, like
Japanese, it is difficult to decide whether a noun
phrase has an antecedent. We previously estimated
the referential properties of noun phrases that cor-
respond to articles for the translation of Japanese
noun phrases into English (Murata and Nagao 1993).
By using these referential properties, our system de-
termines the referents of noun phrases in Japanese
sentences. Noun phrases are classified by referential
property into generic noun phrases, definite noun
phrases, and indefinite noun phrases. When the ref-
erential property of a noun phrase is a definite noun
phrase, the noun phrase can refer to the entity de-
noted by a noun phrase that has already appeared.
When the referential property of a noun phrase is an
indefinite noun phrase or a generic noun phrase, the
noun phrase cannot refer to the entity denoted by a
noun phrase that has already appeared.
It is insufficient to determine referents of noun
phrases using only the referential property. This is
because even if the referential property of a noun
phrase is a definite noun phrase, the noun phrase
does not refer to the entity denoted by a noun phrase
which has a different modifier or possessor. There-
fore, we also use the modifiers and possessors of noun
phrases in determining referents of noun phrases.
In connection with our approach, we would like to
emphasize the following points:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.974277846153846">
• So far little work has been done on determining
the referents of noun phrases in Japanese.
• Since the Japanese language has no articles, it is
difficult to decide whether a noun phrase has an
antecedent or not. We use referential properties
to solve this problem.
• We determine the possessors of entities denoted
by noun phrases and use them like modifiers in
estimating the referents of noun phrases. Since
the method uses the sematic relation between
an entity and the possessor, which is a language-
independent knowledge, it can be used in any
other language.

tence refer to the same old man, and they are in
anaphoric relation.

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965809523809">
When the system analyzes the anaphoric relation
of noun phrases like these, the referential proper-
ties of noun phrases are important. The referential
property of a noun phrase here means how the noun
phrase denotes the referent. If the system can rec-
ognize that the second &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man)&amp;quot; has
the referential property of the definite noun phrase,
indicating that the noun phrase refers to the con-
textually non-ambiguous entity, it will be able to
judge that the second &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man)&amp;quot; refers
to the entity denoted by the first &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old
man). The referential property plays an important
role in clarifying the anaphoric relation.
We previously classified noun phrases by referen-
tial property into the following three types (Murata
and Nagao 1993).
Generic noun phrase A noun phrase is classified
as generic when it denotes all members of the class
described by the noun phrase or the class itself of
the noun phrase. For example, &amp;quot;INU(dog)&amp;quot; in the
following sentence is a generic noun phrase.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.867171333333333">
INU-WA YAKUNI-TATSU.
(dog) (useful)
(Dogs are useful.)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.968557529411765">
A generic noun phrase cannot refer to the entity de-
noted by an indefinite or definite noun phrase. Two
generic noun phrases can have the same referent.
Definite noun phrase A noun phrase is classi-
fied as definite when it denotes a contextually non-
ambiguous member of the class of the noun phrase.
For example, &amp;quot;INU(dog)&amp;quot; in the following sentence
is a definite noun phrase.
INU-WA MUKOUHE ITTA.
(dog) (away) (go)
(The dog went away.)
A definite noun phrase can refer to the entity de-
noted by a noun phrase that has already appeared.
Indefinite noun phrase An indefinite noun
phrase denotes an arbitrary member of the class of
the noun phrase. For example, &amp;quot;INU(dog)&amp;quot; in the
following sentence is an indefinite noun phrase.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.7590005">
INU-GA SANBIKI IRU.
(dog) (three) (there is)
(There are three dogs.)

An indefinite noun phrase cannot refer to the entity
denoted by a noun phrase that has already appeared.
3 How to Determine the Referent of
a Noun Phrase
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.8685635">
To determine referents of noun phrases, we made the
following three constraints.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995349333333333">
1. Referential property constraint
2. Modifier constraint
3. Possessor constraint
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99944275">
When two noun phrases which have the same head
noun satisfy these three constraints, the system
judges that the two noun phrases have the same ref-
erent.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996956">
3.1 Referential Property Constraint
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.938386333333333">
First, our system estimates the referential property
of a noun phrase by using the method described
in one of our previous papers (Murata and Nagao
1993). The method estimates a referential property
using surface expressions in the sentences. For ex-
ample, since the second &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man)&amp;quot; in
the following sentences is accompanied by a particle
&amp;quot;WA (topic)&amp;quot; and the predicate is in the past tense,
it is estimated to be a definite noun phrase.
OJIISAN-WA JIMEN-NI KOSHI-WO-OROSHITA.
(old man) (ground) (sit down)
(The old man sat down on the ground.)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6292885">
YAGATE OJIISAN-WA NEMUTTE-SHIMAIMATTA.
(soon) (old man) (fall asleep)
(He soon fell asleep.)
(6)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897615384615">
Next, our system determines the referent of a
noun phrase by using its estimated referential prop-
erty. When a noun phrase is estimated to be a def-
inite noun phrase, our system judges that the noun
phrase refers to the entity denoted by a previous
noun phrase which has the same head noun. For
example, the second &amp;quot;OJIISAN&amp;quot; in the above sen-
tences is estimated to be a definite noun phrase, and
our system judges that it refers to the entity denoted
by the first &amp;quot;OJIISAN&amp;quot;.
When a noun phrase is not estimated to be a defi-
nite noun phrase, it usually does not refer to the en-
tity denoted by a noun phrase that has already been

mentioned. Our method, however, might fail to es-
timate the referential property, so the noun phrase
might refer to the entity denoted by a noun phrase
that has already been mentioned. Therefore, when
a noun phrase is not estimated to be a definite noun
phrase, our system gets a possible referent of the
noun phrase and determines whether or not the noun
phrase refers to it by using the following three kinds
of information.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.965874625">
• the plausibility(P) of the estimated referential
property that is a definite noun phrase
When our system estimates a referential prop-
erty, it outputs the score of each category (Mu-
rata and Nagao 1993). The value of the plausi-
bility (P) is given by the score.
• the weight (W) of the salience of a possible
referent
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982496">
The weight (W) of the salience is given by the
particles such as &amp;quot;WA (topic)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;GA (sub-
ject)&amp;quot;. The entity denoted by a noun phrase
which has a high salience, is easy to be referred
by a noun phrase.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.957854">
• the distance (D) between the estimated noun
phrase and a possible referent
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997121222222222">
The distance (D) is the number of noun phrases
between the estimated noun phrase and a pos-
sible referent.
When the value given by these three kinds of infor-
mation is higher than a given threshold, our system
judges that the noun phrase refers to the possible
referent. Otherwise, it judges that the noun phrase
does not refer to the possible referent and is an in-
definite noun phrase or a generic noun phrase.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993273">
3.2 Modifier Constraint
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969351285714286">
It is insufficient to determine referents of noun
phrases by using only the referential property.
When two noun phrases have different modi-
fiers, they usually do not have the same referent.
For example, &amp;quot;MIGHright)-NO HOO(cheek)&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;HIDARI(left)-NO HOO(cheek)&amp;quot; in the following
sentences do not have the same referent.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.840154714285714">
KONO OJIISAN-NO KOBU-WA MIGI-NO HOO-NI ATTA.
(this) (old man) (lump) (right) (cheek) (be on)
(This old man&apos;s lump was on his right cheek.)
TENGU-WA, KOBU-WO HIDARI-NO HOO-NI TSUKETA.
(tengu)2 (lump) (left) (cheek) (put on)
(The ntengu&amp;quot; put a lump on his left cheek)
(7)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9947155">
Therefore, we made the following constraint: A
noun phrase that has a modifier cannot refer to the
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.556475">
2A tengu is a kind of monster.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999183">
entity denoted by a noun phrase that does not have
the same modifier. A noun phrase that does not
have a modifier can refer to the entity denoted by a
noun phrase that has any modifier.
The constraint is incomplete, and is not truly ap-
plicable to all cases. There are some exceptions
where a noun can refer to the entity of a noun that
has a different modifier. But we use the constraint
because we can get a higher precision than if we did
not use it.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992206">
3.3 Possessor Constraint
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951888888889">
When a noun phrase has a semantic marker PAR (a
part of a body),3 our system tries to estimate the
possessor of the entity denoted by the noun phrase.
We suppose that the possessor of a noun phrase is
the subject or the noun phrase&apos;s nearest topic that
has a semantic marker HUM (human) or a seman-
tic marker ANI (animal). For example, we examine
two instances of &amp;quot;HOO (cheek)&amp;quot; in the following sen-
tences, which have a semantic marker PAR.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.918047153846154">
OJIISAN-NIWA {OJIISAN-N0}4 HIDARI-NO
(old man) (old man&apos;s) (left)
HOO-NI KOBU-GA ATTA.
(cheek) (lump) (be on)
(This old man had a lump on his left cheek.)
SORE-WA KOBUSHI-HODO-NO KOBU-DATTA.
(it) (person&apos;s fist) (lump)
(It is about the size of a person&apos;s fist.)
OJIISAN-GA [OJIISAN-NO] 1100-WO
(old man (subject)) (old man&apos;s) (cheek)
HUKURAMASETE IRUYOUNI-MIETA.
(puff) (look as if)
(He looked as if he had puffed out his cheek.)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998791375">
The possessor of the first &amp;quot;1100 (cheek)&amp;quot; is deter-
mined to be &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man)&amp;quot; because &amp;quot;OJI-
ISAN (old man)&amp;quot;, which has a semantic marker
HUM (human), is followed by a particle &amp;quot;NIWA
(topic)&amp;quot; and is the topic of the sentence. The posses-
sor of the second &amp;quot;1100 (cheek)&amp;quot; is also determined
to be &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man)&amp;quot; because &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old
man)&amp;quot; is the subject of the Sentence.
We made the following constraint, which is simi-
lar to the modifier constraint, by using possessors.
When the possessor of a noun phrase is estimated,
the noun phrase cannot refer to the entity denoted
by a noun phrase that does not have the same pos-
sessor. When the possessor of a noun phrase is not
estimated, the noun phrase can refer to the entity
denoted by a noun phrase that has any possessor.

For example, since the two instances of &amp;quot;1100

4 Anaphora Resolution System
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.976654">
4.1 Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999120461538462">
Before referents are determined, sentences are trans-
formed into a case structure by the case structure
analyzer (Kurohashi and Nagao 1994).
Referents of noun phrases are determined by us-
ing heuristic rules which are made from information
such as the three constraints mentioned in Section 3.
Using these rules, our system takes possible referents
and gives them points. It judges that the candidate
having the maximum total score is the referent. This
is because a number of types of information are com-
bined in anaphora resolution. We can specify which
rule takes priority by using points.
The heuristic rules are given in the following form.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.792919">
Condition { Proposal Proposal .. }
Proposal := ( Possible-Referent Point)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996425">
Here, Condition consists of surface expressions, se-
mantic constraints and referential properties. In
Possible-Referent, a possible referent, &amp;quot;Indefinite&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Generic&amp;quot;, or other things are written. &amp;quot;Indefinite&amp;quot;
means that the noun phase is an indefinite noun
phrase, and it does not refer to the entity denoted by
a previous noun phrase. Point means the plausibility
value of the possible referent.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987686">
4.2 Heuristic Rule for Estimating Referents
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.909349304347826">
We made 8 heuristic rules for the resolution of noun
phrase anaphora. Some of them are given below.
R1 When a noun phrase is modified by the words
&amp;quot;SOREZORE-NO (each)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ONOONO-NO
(each)&amp;quot;,
{(Indefinite, 25)}
R2 When a noun phrase is estimated to be a defi-
nite noun phrase, and satisfies the modifier and
possessor constraints, and the same noun phrase
X has already appeared,
{(The noun phrase X, 30)}
R3 When a noun phrase is estimated to be a generic
noun phrase,
{(Generic, 10)}
R4 When a noun phrase is estimated to be an in-
definite noun phrase,
{(Indefinite, 10)}
R5 When a noun phrase X is not estimated to be a
definite noun phrase,
{ (A noun phrase X which satisfies the modifier
and possessor constraints, P + W — D + 4)}
The values P, IV, D are as defined in Section
3.1.

</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.950145">
5.1 Experiment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979354166667">
Before determining the referents of noun phrases,
sentences were at first transformed into a case struc-
ture by the case structure analyzer (Kurohashi and
Nagao 1994). The errors made by the case analyzer
were corrected by hand. Table 1 shows the results
of determining the referents of noun phrases.
To confirm that the three constraints (referential
property, modifier, and possessor) are effective, we
experimented under several different conditions and
compared them. The results are shown in Table 2.
Precision is the fraction of noun phrases which were
judged to have antecedents. Recall is the fraction of
noun phrases which have antecedents.
In these experiments we used training sentences
and test sentences. The training sentences were used
to make the heuristic rules in Section 4.2 by hand.
The test sentences were used to confirm the effec-
tiveness of these rules.
In Table 2, Method 1 is the method mentioned in
Section 3 which uses all three constraints. Method 2
is the case in which a noun phrase can refer to the
entity denoted by a noun phrase, only when the esti-
mated referential property is a definite noun phrase,
where the modifier and possessor constraints are
used. Method 3 does not use a referential prop-
erty. It only uses information such as distance, topic-
focus, modifier, and possessor. Method 4 does not
use the modifier and possessor constraints.
The table shows many results. In Method 1, both
the recall and the precision were relatively high in
comparison with the other methods. This indicates
that the referential property was used properly in the
method that is described in this paper. Method 1
was higher than Method 3 in both recall and pre-
cision. This indicates that the information of refer-
ential property is necessary. In Method 2, the re-
call was low because there were many noun phrases
that were definite but were estimated to be indefinite
or generic, and the system estimated that the noun
phrases cannot refer to noun phrases. In Method 4,
the precision was low. Since the modifier and pos-
sessor constraints were not used, and there were
many pairs of two noun phrases that did not co-
refer, such as &amp;quot;HIDARI(left)-NO HOO(cheek)&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;MIGI(right)-NO HOO(cheek)&amp;quot;, these pairs were in-
correctly interpreted to be co-references. This indi-
cates that it is necessary to use the modifier and
possessor constraints.

judged that they do not refer to it because the mod-
ifiers of the two instances of &amp;quot;ANA (hole)&amp;quot; are dif-
ferent. In order to correctly analyze this case, it is
necessary to decide whether the two different expres-
sions are equal in meaning.

This paper describes a method for the determination
of referents of noun phrases by using their referen-
tial properties, modifiers, and possessors. Using this
method on training sentences, we obtained a preci-

termination of referents of noun phrases that have
antecedents. On test sentences, we obtained a pre-
cision rate of 79% and a recall rate of 77%. This
confirmed that the use of the referential properties,
modifiers, and possessors of noun phrases is effective.

We present a method for determining the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences by using the referential properties, modifiers, and possessors&apos; of noun phrases. Since the Japanese language has no articles, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase has an antecedent or not. We had previously estimated the referential properties of noun phrases that correspond to articles by using clue words in the sentences (Murata and Nagao 1993). By using these referential properties, our system determined the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences. Furthermore we used the modifiers and possessors of noun phrases in determining the referents of noun phrases. As a result, on training sentences we obtained a precision rate of 82% and a recall rate of 85% in the determination of the referents of noun phrases that have antecedents.

Referents of noun phrases are determined by using heuristic rules which are made from information such as the three constraints mentioned in Section 3. Using these rules, our system takes possible referents and gives them points. It judges that the candidate having the maximum total score is the referent. This is because a number of types of information are combined in anaphora resolution. We can specify which rule takes priority by using points. The heuristic rules are given in the following form.

The errors made by the case analyzer were corrected by hand. Table 1 shows the results of determining the referents of noun phrases. To confirm that the three constraints (referential property, modifier, and possessor) are effective, we experimented under several different conditions and compared them. The results are shown in Table 2. Precision is the fraction of noun phrases which were judged to have antecedents. Recall is the fraction of noun phrases which have antecedents.

Makoto Nagao Kyoto University Yoshida-Honmachi, Sakyo, Kyoto 606-01, Japan For languages that have articles, like English, we can use articles (&amp;quot;the&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, and so on) to decide whether a noun phrase has an antecedent or not. In contrast, for languages that have no articles, like Japanese, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase has an antecedent. We previously estimated the referential properties of noun phrases that correspond to articles for the translation of Japanese noun phrases into English (Murata and Nagao 1993). By using these referential properties, our system determines the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences. Noun phrases are classified by referential property into generic noun phrases, definite noun phrases, and indefinite noun phrases. When the referential property of a noun phrase is a definite noun phrase, the noun phrase can refer to the entity denoted by a noun phrase that has already appeared. When the referential property of a noun phrase is an indefinite noun phrase or a generic noun phrase, the noun phrase cannot refer to the entity denoted by a noun phrase that has already </context>

If the system can recognize that the second &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man)&amp;quot; has the referential property of the definite noun phrase, indicating that the noun phrase refers to the contextually non-ambiguous entity, it will be able to judge that the second &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man)&amp;quot; refers to the entity denoted by the first &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man). The referential property plays an important role in clarifying the anaphoric relation. We previously classified noun phrases by referential property into the following three types (Murata and Nagao 1993). Generic noun phrase A noun phrase is classified as generic when it denotes all members of the class described by the noun phrase or the class itself of the noun phrase. For example, &amp;quot;INU(dog)&amp;quot; in the following sentence is a generic noun phrase. INU-WA YAKUNI-TATSU. (dog) (useful) (Dogs are useful.) A generic noun phrase cannot refer to the entity denoted by an indefinite or definite noun phrase. Two generic noun phrases can have the same referent. Definite noun phrase A noun phrase is classified as definite when it denotes a contextually nonambiguous member of the class of the noun phrase. F</context>

Referential property constraint 2. Modifier constraint 3. Possessor constraint When two noun phrases which have the same head noun satisfy these three constraints, the system judges that the two noun phrases have the same referent. 3.1 Referential Property Constraint First, our system estimates the referential property of a noun phrase by using the method described in one of our previous papers (Murata and Nagao 1993). The method estimates a referential property using surface expressions in the sentences. For example, since the second &amp;quot;OJIISAN (old man)&amp;quot; in the following sentences is accompanied by a particle &amp;quot;WA (topic)&amp;quot; and the predicate is in the past tense, it is estimated to be a definite noun phrase. OJIISAN-WA JIMEN-NI KOSHI-WO-OROSHITA. (old man) (ground) (sit down) (The old man sat down on the ground.) YAGATE OJIISAN-WA NEMUTTE-SHIMAIMATTA. (soon) (old man) (fall asleep) (He soon fell asleep.) (6) Next, our system determines the referent of a noun phrase by using its estimated referential property</context>

Our method, however, might fail to estimate the referential property, so the noun phrase might refer to the entity denoted by a noun phrase that has already been mentioned. Therefore, when a noun phrase is not estimated to be a definite noun phrase, our system gets a possible referent of the noun phrase and determines whether or not the noun phrase refers to it by using the following three kinds of information. • the plausibility(P) of the estimated referential property that is a definite noun phrase When our system estimates a referential property, it outputs the score of each category (Murata and Nagao 1993). The value of the plausibility (P) is given by the score. • the weight (W) of the salience of a possible referent The weight (W) of the salience is given by the particles such as &amp;quot;WA (topic)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;GA (subject)&amp;quot;. The entity denoted by a noun phrase which has a high salience, is easy to be referred by a noun phrase. • the distance (D) between the estimated noun phrase and a possible referent The distance (D) is the number of noun phrases between the estimated noun phrase and a possible referent. When the value given by these three kinds of information is higher than a given threshold, our syste</context>
