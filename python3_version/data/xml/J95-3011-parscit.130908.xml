&amp;quot;Hyperproof is wondofill. With it you can
construct and check proofi in an expanded
version of the language of Tarski&apos;s
Hyperproof lets you use pictorially-presented
information and pictorially-oriented deduction
techniques in combination with sentences and
syntactic rules. It is an extraordinarily
impressive programming achievement. The
manual is well-written and contains a great
many well-designed exercises. Hyperproof will
make learning first-order logic enormously more

Dimensions of Register
Variation
A Cross-Linguistic Comparison
Douglas Biber
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999478142857143">
This book offers a linguistic analysis of
register in four widely differing languages:
English, Nukulaelae Tuvaluan, Korean, and
Somali. Striking similarities as well as
differences emerge, allowing Biber to predict
for the first time cross-linguistic universals of
register variation.

Computational Phonology
A Constraint-Based Approach
Steven Bird
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.970624">
This book is the first to survey the latest
developments in computational phonology,
in a way that is accessible to computational
linguists, phonologists and computer
scientists alike. The goal of this book is to
explore the use of constraints in modern non-
linear phonology and then – drawing on
insights from constraint-based grammar and
constraint logic programming – to formalize
and implement a constraint-based phonology.

In this examination Gorrell argues for a dis-
tinct processing component which is devoted
to the recovery of syntactic structure and
which utilizes the contrasting types of infor-
mation found within a Government–Binding
grammar. He contrasts the primary and
secondary relations in a phrase-structure tree,
and shows how this distinction is reflected in
the internal structure of the parser.

The Journal of Semantics is the leading
international forum for the rapid developments
that are taking place in the field of natural
language semantics. Increasingly, its crucial
relevance is recognized in all areas of natural
language research. High formal standards have
been set as it has striven to meet the growing
need for computational and empirical adequacy.
This process has been aided by the intense
interdisciplinary exchange and cooperation that
has simultaneously occurred, setting new
standards for the field as a whole and working
towards a true integration.
The editors and advisory board of the Journal of Semantics are composed of
internationally established specialists, and the journal is firmly rooted in the
interdisciplinary study of natural language semantics, with linguistics,
psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence as the major contributing
disciplines.

Guidelines for Submissions

<bodyText confidence="0.96454475">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.852104">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997241625">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, &apos;Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.

<abstract confidence="0.929918">This book is the first to survey the latest developments in computational phonology, in a way that is accessible to computational linguists, phonologists and computer scientists alike. The goal of this book is to explore the use of constraints in modern nonlinear phonology and then – drawing on insights from constraint-based grammar and constraint logic programming – to formalize and implement a constraint-based phonology.

<author confidence="0.997721">Paul Gorrell</author>
<abstract confidence="0.997235">In this examination Gorrell argues for a distinct processing component which is devoted to the recovery of syntactic structure and which utilizes the contrasting types of information found within a Government–Binding grammar. He contrasts the primary and secondary relations in a phrase-structure tree, and shows how this distinction is reflected in the internal structure of the parser.</abstract>
