Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934222222222">
This half-day tutorial introduces participants to data-intensive text processing with the MapReduce
programming model [1], using the open-source Hadoop implementation. The focus will be on scalability
and the tradeoffs associated with distributed processing of large datasets. Content will include general
discussions about algorithm design, presentation of illustrative algorithms, case studies in HLT
applications, as well as practical advice in writing Hadoop programs and running Hadoop clusters.
Amazon has generously agreed to provide each participant with $100 in Amazon Web Services (AWS)
credits that can used toward its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) “utility computing” service (sufficient for
1000 instance-hours). EC2 allows anyone to rapidly provision Hadoop clusters “on the fly” without
upfront hardware investments, and provides a low-cost vehicle for exploring Hadoop.

Intended Audience
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99699">
The tutorial is targeted at any NLP researcher interested in data-intensive processing and scalability
issues in general. No background in parallel or distributed computing is necessary, but a prior knowledge
of HLT is assumed.

Chris Dyer is a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park, in the Department of
Linguistics. His current research interests include statistical machine translation, machine learning, and
the relationship between artificial language processing systems and the human linguistic processing
system. He has served on program committees for AMTA, ACL, COLING, EACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ISWLT,
and the ACL Workshops on Machine translation, and is one of the developers of the Moses open source
machine translation toolkit. He has practical experience solving NLP problems with both the Hadoop
MapReduce framework and Google’s MapReduce implementation, which was made possible by an
internship with Google Research in 2008.
