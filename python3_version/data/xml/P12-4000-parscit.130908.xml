Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9994231875">
A total of 17 tutorial proposals were submitted to the ACL 2012 Tutorials track from which six were
finally accepted. I am grateful to the ACL community for the diverse, and high-quality proposals I
received. This guarantees a strong tutorials track at ACL 2012, but at the same time made the selection
process very difficult. All 17 proposals were reviewed by the chair with assistance by colleagues and
experts from the NLP community where necessary. The final selection was approved by the ACL 2012
General Chair.
The following criteria guided the selection: (1) Quality: content, scope and organization of the proposal,
competence and experience of the presenters. (2) Diversity: I tried to include diverse topics ranging
from linguistically motivated approaches to current developments in machine learning. (3) Novelty:
Tutorials recently held at ACL events were not selected.
One of my aims was to convince the presenters that they make their tutorials accessible to the novice in
the respective areas. In my acceptance email I told them: “When preparing for the tutorial, please keep
in mind that the target audience is not your buddies whom you may want to impress, but researchers
and graduate students who are not familiar with your topic.”
I would like to thank all the presenters for putting a lot of effort in the tutorials. I am indebted to the
Local Chairs, the Publication Chairs and the ACL 2012 General Chair for making it happen.
