SIMPLIFICA is an authoring tool for produc-
ing simplified texts in Portuguese. It provides
functionalities for lexical and syntactic simpli-
fication and for readability assessment. This
tool is the first of its kind for Portuguese; it
brings innovative aspects for simplification
tools in general, since the authoring process is
guided by readability assessment based on the
levels of literacy of the Brazilian population.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999964944444445">
In order to promote digital inclusion and accessi-
bility for people with low levels of literacy, partic-
ularly access to documents available on the web, it
is important to provide textual information in a
simple and easy way. Indeed, the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.01 establishes
a set of guidelines that discuss accessibility issues
and provide accessibility design solutions. WCAG
requirements address not only structure and tech-
nological aspects, but also how the content should
be made available to users. However, Web devel-
opers are not always responsible for content prepa-
ration and authoring in a Website. Moreover, in the
context of Web 2.0 it becomes extremely difficult
to develop completely WCAG conformant Web-
sites, since users without any prior knowledge
about the guidelines directly participate on the con-
tent authoring process of Web applications.

In Brazil, since 2001, the INAF index (National
Indicator of Functional Literacy) has been com-
puted annually to measure the levels of literacy of
the Brazilian population. The 2009 report pre-
sented a still worrying scenario: 7% of the individ-
uals were classified as illiterate; 21% as literate at
the rudimentary level; 47% as literate at the basic
level; and only 25% as literate at the advanced lev-
el (INAF, 2009). These literacy levels are defined
as: (1) Illiterate: individuals who cannot perform
simple tasks such as reading words and phrases;
(2) Rudimentary: individuals who can find expli-
cit information in short and familiar texts (such as
an advertisement or a short letter); (3) Basic: indi-
viduals who can read and understand texts of aver-
age length, and find information even when it is
necessary to make some inference; and (4) Ad-
vanced/Fully: individuals who can read longer
texts, relating their parts, comparing and interpret-
ing information, distinguish fact from opinion,
make inferences and synthesize.
We present in this paper the current version of
an authoring tool named SIMPLIFICA. It helps
authors to create simple texts targeted at poor lite-
rate readers. It extends the previous version pre-
sented in Candido et al. (2009) with two new mod-
ules: lexical simplification and the assessment of
the level of complexity of the input texts. The
study is part of the PorSimples project2 (Simplifi-
cation of Portuguese Text for Digital Inclusion and
Accessibility) (Aluisio et al., 2008).
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2

we describe SIMPLIFICA and the underlying
technology for lexical and syntactic simplification,
and for readability assessment. In Section 3 we
summarize the interaction steps that we propose to
show in the demonstration session targeting texts
for low-literate readers of Portuguese. Section 4
presents final remarks with emphasis on why de-
monstrating this system is relevant.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977221260869565">
SIMLIFICA is a web-based WYSIWYG editor,
based on TinyMCE web editor3. The user inputs a
text in the editor and customizes the simplification
settings, where he/she can choose: (i) strong sim-
plification, where all the complex syntactic phe-
nomena (see details in Section 2.2) are treated for
each sentence, or customized simplification, where
the user chooses one or more syntactic simplifica-
tion phenomena to be treated for each sentence,
and (ii) one or more thesauri to be used in the syn-
tactic and lexical simplification processes. Then
the user activates the readability assessment mod-
ule to predict the complexity level of a text. This
module maps the text to one of the three levels of
literacy defined by INAF: rudimentary, basic or
advanced. According to the resulting readability
level the user can trigger the lexical and/or syntac-
tic simplifications modules, revise the automatic
simplification and restart the cycle by checking the
readability level of the current version of the text.
Figure 1 summarizes how the three modules are
integrated and below we describe in more detail
the SIMPLIFICA modules.

2.1 Lexical Simplification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968279069767">
Basically, the first part of the lexical simplification
process consists of tokenizing the original text and
marking the words that are considered complex. In
order to judge a word as complex or not, we use 3
dictionaries created for the PorSimples project: one
containing words common to youngsters, a second
one composed by frequent words extracted from
news texts for children and nationwide newspa-
pers, and a third one containing concrete words.
The lexical simplification module also uses the
Unitex-PB dictionary4 for finding the lemma of the
words in the text, so that it is possible to look for it
in the simple words dictionaries. The problem of
looking for a lemma directly in a dictionary is that
there are ambiguous words and we are not able to
deal with different word senses. For dealing with
part-of-speech (POS) ambiguity, we use the
MXPOST POS tagger5 trained over NILC tagset6.
After the text is tagged, the words that are not
proper nouns, prepositions and numerals are se-
lected, and their POS tags are used to look for their
lemmas in the dictionaries. As the tagger has not a
100% precision and some words may not be in the
dictionary, we look for the lemma only (without
the tag) when we are not able to find the lemma-
tag combination in the dictionary. Still, if we are
not able to find the word, the lexical simplification
module assumes that the word is complex and
marks it for simplification.
The last step of the process consists in providing
simpler synonyms for the marked words. For this
task, we use the thesauri for Portuguese TeP 2.07
and the lexical ontology for Portuguese PAPEL8.
This task is carried out when the user clicks on a
marked word, which triggers a search in the the-
sauri for synonyms that are also present in the
common words dictionary. If simpler words are
found, they are listed in order, from the simpler to
the more complex ones. To determine this order,
we used Google API to search each word in the
web: we assume that the higher a word frequency,
the simpler it is. Automatic word sense disambigu-
ation is left for future work.

2.2 Syntactic Simplification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991351351351">
Syntactic simplification is accomplished by a rule-
based system, which comprises seven operations
that are applied sentence-by-sentence to a text in
order to make its syntactic structure simpler.
Our rule-based text simplification system is
based on a manual for Brazilian Portuguese syntac-
tic simplification (Specia et al., 2008). According
to this manual, simplification operations should be
applied when any of the 22 linguistic phenomena
covered by our system (see Candido et al. (2009)
for details) is detected. Our system treats apposi-
tive, relative, coordinate and subordinate clauses,
which had already been addressed by previous
work on text simplification (Siddharthan, 2003).
Additionally, we treat passive voice, sentences in
an order other than Subject-Verb-Object (SVO),
and long adverbial phrases. The simplification op-
erations available to treat these phenomena are:
split sentence, change particular discourse markers
by simpler ones, change passive to active voice,
invert the order of clauses, convert to subject-verb-
object ordering, and move long adverbial phrases.
Each sentence is parsed in order to identify syn-
tactic phenomena for simplification and to segment
the sentence into portions that will be handled by
the operations. We use the parser PALAVRAS
(Bick, 2000) for Portuguese. Gasperin et al. (2010)
present the evaluation of the performance of our
syntactic simplification system.
Since our syntactic simplifications are conserva-
tive, the simplified texts become longer than the
original ones due to sentence splitting. We ac-
knowledge that low-literacy readers prefer short
texts, and in the future we aim to provide summa-
rization within SIMPLIFICA (see (Watanabe et al.,
2009)). Here, the shortening of the text is a respon-
sibility of the author.

2.3 Readability assessment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996985875">
With our readability assessment module, we can
predict the readability level of a text, which cor-
responds to the literacy level expected from the
target reader: rudimentary, basic or advanced.
We have adopted a machine-learning classifier
to identify the level of the input text; we use the
Support Vector Machines implementation from
Weka9 toolkit (SMO). We have used 7 corpora
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.613198">

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999701555555556">
within 2 different genres (general news and popu-
lar science articles) to train the classifier. Three of
these corpora contain original texts published in
online newspapers and magazines. The other cor-
pora contain manually simplified versions of most
of the original texts. These were simplified by a
linguist, specialized in text simplification, accord-
ing to the two levels of simplification proposed in
our project, natural and strong, which result in
texts adequate for the basic and rudimentary litera-
cy levels, respectively.
Our feature set is composed by cognitively-
motivated features derived from the Coh-Metrix-
PORT tool10, which is an adaptation for Brazilian
Portuguese of Coh-Metrix 2.0 (free version of
Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al, 2003)) also developed
in the context of the PorSimples project. Coh-
Metrix-PORT implements the metrics in Table 1.

We also included seven new metrics to Coh-

We measured the performance of the classifier
on identifying the levels of the input texts by a
cross-validation experiment. We trained the clas-
sifier on our 7 corpora and reached 90% F-measure
on identifying texts at advanced level, 48% at basic
level, and 73% at rudimentary level.

3. A working session at SIMPLIFICA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975142857143">
In the NAACL demonstration section we aim to
present all functionalities of the tool for authoring
simple texts, SIMPLIFICA. We will run all steps
of the authoring process – readability assessment,
lexical simplification and syntactic simplification –
in order to demonstrate the use of the tool in pro-
ducing a text for basic and rudimentary readers of
Portuguese, regarding the lexical and the syntactic
complexity of an original text.
We outline a script of our demonstration at
http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/porsimples/demo/dem
o_script.htm. In order to help the understanding by
non-speakers of Portuguese we provide the transla-
tions of the example texts shown.

4. Final Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999547">
A tool for authoring simple texts in Portuguese is
an innovative software, as are all the modules that
form the tool. Such tool is extremely important in
the construction of texts understandable by the ma-
jority of the Brazilian population. SIMPLIFICA’s
target audience is varied and includes: teachers that
use online text for reading practices; publishers;
journalists aiming to reach poor literate readers;
content providers for distance learning programs;
government agencies that aim to communicate to
the population as a whole; companies that produce
technical manuals and medicine instructions; users
of legal language, in order to facilitate the under-
standing of legal documents by lay people; and
experts in language studies and computational lin-
guistics for future research.
Future versions of SIMPLIFICA will also pro-
vide natural simplification, where the target sen-
tences for simplifications are chosen by a machine
learning classifier (Gasperin et al., 2009).

The 2009 report presented a still worrying scenario: 7% of the individuals were classified as illiterate; 21% as literate at the rudimentary level; 47% as literate at the basic level; and only 25% as literate at the advanced level (INAF, 2009). These literacy levels are defined as: (1) Illiterate: individuals who cannot perform simple tasks such as reading words and phrases; (2) Rudimentary: individuals who can find explicit information in short and familiar texts (such as an advertisement or a short letter); (3) Basic: individuals who can read and understand texts of average length, and find information even when it is necessary to make some inference; and (4) Advanced/Fully: individuals who can read longer texts, relating their parts, comparing and interpreting information, distinguish fact from opinion, make inferences and synth</context>

Our rule-based text simplification system is based on a manual for Brazilian Portuguese syntactic simplification (Specia et al., 2008). According to this manual, simplification operations should be applied when any of the 22 linguistic phenomena covered by our system (see Candido et al. (2009) for details) is detected. Our system treats appositive, relative, coordinate and subordinate clauses, which had already been addressed by previous work on text simplification (Siddharthan, 2003). Additionally, we treat passive voice, sentences in an order other than Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), and long adverbial phrases. The simplification operations available to treat these phenomena are: split sentence, change particular discourse markers by simpler ones, change passive to active voice, invert the order of clauses, convert to subject-verbobject ordering, and move long adverbial phrases. Each sentence is parsed in order to identify syntactic phenomena for simplification and to segment the sentence into portions that will be handled by the operations. We use the parser PALAVRAS (Bick,</context>
