In Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), it is rea-
sonable to globally assign semantic roles
due to strong dependencies among argu-
ments. Some relations between arguments
significantly characterize the structural in-
formation of argument structure. In this
paper, we concentrate on thematic hierar-
chy that is a rank relation restricting syn-
tactic realization of arguments. A log-
linear model is proposed to accurately
identify thematic rank between two argu-
ments. To import structural information,
we employ re-ranking technique to incor-
porate thematic rank relations into local
semantic role classification results. Exper-
imental results show that automatic pre-
diction of thematic hierarchy can help se-
mantic role classification.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999799478260869">
In Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), it is evident that
the arguments in one sentence are highly corre-
lated. For example, a predicate will have no more
than one Agent in most cases. It is reasonable to
label one argument while taking into account other
arguments. More structural information of all ar-
guments should be encoded in SRL approaches.
This paper explores structural information of
predicate-argument structure from the perspec-
tive of rank relations between arguments. The-
matic hierarchy theory argues that there exists a
language independent rank of possible semantic
roles, which establishes priority among arguments
with respect to their syntactic realization (Levin
and Hovav, 2005). This construct has been widely
implicated in linguistic phenomena, such as in the
subject selection rule of Fillmore’s Case Grammar
(1968): ”If there is an A [=Agent], it becomes the
subject; otherwise, if there is an I [=Instrument],
it becomes the subject; otherwise, the subject is
the O [=Object, i.e., Patient/Theme]”. This rule
implicitly establishes precedence relations among
semantic roles mentioned and can be simplified to:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.447434">
Agent &gt;- Instrument &gt;- Patient/Theme
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999188857142857">
Emerging from a range of more basic semantic
properties of the ranked semantic roles, thematic
hierarchies can help to construct mapping from se-
mantics to syntax. It is therefore an appealing op-
tion for argument structure analysis. For example,
if the the rank of argument ai is shown higher than
aj, then the assignment [ai=Patient, aj=Agent] is
illegal, since the role Agent is the highest role.
We test the hypothesis that thematic rank be-
tween arguments can be accurately detected by
using syntax clues. In this paper, the concept
”thematic rank” between two arguments ai and aj
means the relationship that ai is prior to aj or aj is
prior to ai. Assigning different labels to different
relations between ai and aj, we formulate predic-
tion of thematic rank between two arguments as a
multi-class classification task. A log-linear model
is put forward for classification. Experiments on
CoNLL-2005 data show that this approach can
get an good performance, achieving 96.42% ac-
curacy on gold parsing data and 95.14% accuracy
on Charniak automatic parsing data.
Most existing SRL systems divide this task into
two subtasks: Argument Identification (AI) and
Semantic Role Classification (SRC). To add struc-
tural information to a local SRL approach, we in-
corporate thematic hierarchy relations into local
classification results using re-ranking technique
in the SRC stage. Two re-ranking approaches,
1) hard constraint re-ranking and 2) soft con-
straint re-ranking, are proposed to filter out un-
like global semantic role assignment. Experiments
on CoNLL-2005 data indicate that our method
can yield significant improvement over a state-of-
the-art SRC baseline, achieving 0.93% and 1.32%

2 Prediction of Thematic Rank
2.1 Ranking Arguments in PropBank
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999951">
There are two main problems in modeling the-
matic hierarchy for SRL on PropBank. On the one
hand, there is no consistent meaning of the core
roles (i.e. Arg0-5/ArgA). On the other hand, there
is no consensus over hierarchies of the roles in the
thematic hierarchy. For example, the Patient occu-
pies the second highest hierarchy in some linguis-
tic theories but the lowest in some other theories
(Levin and Hovav, 2005).
In this paper, the proto-role theory (Dowty,
1991) is taken into account to rank PropBank argu-
ments, partially resolving the two problems above.
There are three key points in our solution. First,
the rank of Arg0 is the highest. The Agent is al-
most without exception the highest role in pro-
posed hierarchies. Though PropBank defines se-
mantic roles on a verb by verb basis, for a particu-
lar verb, Arg0 is generally the argument exhibit-
ing features of a prototypical Agent while Arg1
is a prototypical Patient or Theme (Palmer et al.,
2005). As being the proto-Agent, the rank of Arg0
is higher than other numbered arguments. Second,
the rank of the Arg1 is second highest or lowest.
Both hierarchy of Arg1 are tested and discussed in
section 4. Third, we do not rank other arguments.
Two sets of roles closely correspond to num-
bered arguments: 1) referenced arguments and 2)
continuation arguments. To adapt the relation to
help these two kinds of arguments, the equivalence
relation is divided into several sub-categories. In
summary, relations of two arguments ai and aj in
this paper include: 1) ai &gt;- aj: ai is higher than
aj, 2) ai � aj: ai is lower than aj, 3) aiARaj: aj
is the referenced argument of ai, 4) aiRAaj: ai is
the referenced argument of aj, 5) aiACaj: aj is
the continuation argument of ai, 6) aiCAaj: ai is
the continuation argument of aj, 7) ai = aj: ai
and aj are labeled as the same role label, and 8)
ai — aj: ai and aj are labeled as the Arg2-5, but
not in the same type.

Assigning different labels to possible rank be-
tween two arguments ai and aj, such as labeling
ai &gt;- aj as ”&gt;-”, identification of thematic rank
can be formulated as a classification problem. De-

where ψ is the feature map and w is the param-
eter vector to learn. Note that the model pre-
dicts the rank of ai and aj through calculating
STH(ai, aj, r) rather than STH(aj, ai, r), where
ai precedes aj. In other words, the position infor-
mation is implicitly encoded in the model rather
than explicitly as a feature.
The system extracts a number of features to rep-
resent various aspects of the syntactic structure of
a pair of arguments. All features are listed in Table
1. The Path features are designed as a sequential
collection of phrase tags by (Gildea and Jurafsky,
2002). We also use Single Character Category
Path, in which each phrase tag is clustered to a cat-
egory defined by its first character (Pradhan et al.,
2005). To characterize the relation between two
constituents, we combine features of the two indi-
vidual arguments as new features (i.e. conjunction
features). For example, if the category of the first
argument is NP and the category of the second is S,
then the conjunction of category feature is NP-S.

3 Re-ranking Models for SRC

structured solutions outperform local semantic
role classifiers. Punyakanok et al. (2008) raised an
inference procedure with integer linear program-
ming model, which also showed promising results.
Identifying relations among arguments can pro-
vide structural information for SRL. Take the sen-
tence ”[Arg0 She] [V addressed] [Arg1 her hus-
band] [ArgM−MNR with her favorite nickname].”
for example, if the thematic rank of she and her
husband is predicted as that she is higher than her
husband, then her husband should not be assigned
the highest role.
To incorporate the relation information to lo-
cal classification results, we employ re-ranking ap-
proach. Assuming that the local semantic classi-
fier can produce a list of labeling results, our sys-
tem then attempts to pick one from this list accord-
ing to the predicted ranks. Two different polices
are implemented: 1) hard constraint re-ranking,
and 2) soft constraint re-ranking.
Hard Constraint Re-ranking The one picked
up must be strictly in accordance with the ranks.
If the rank prediction result shows the rank of ar-
gument ai is higher than aj, then role assignments
such as [ai=Patient and aj=Agent] will be elim-
inated. Formally, the score function of a global
semantic role assignment is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9518385">
S(a, s) = rl rlSl(ai, si) I(r*(ai, aj), r(si, sj))
i i,j,i&lt;j
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998619722222222">
where the function Sl locally scores an argument;
r* : A x A H R is to predict hierarchy of two
arguments; r : S x S H R is to point out the the-
matic hierarchy of two semantic roles. For exam-
ple, r(Agent, Patient) = ” &gt;- ”. I : R x R H
10, 11 is identity function.
In some cases, there is no role assignment sat-
isfies all predicted relations because of prediction
mistakes. For example, if the hierarchy detec-
tion result of a = (a1, a2, a3) is (r*(a1, a2) =&gt;-
, r*(a2, a3) =&gt;-, r*(a1, a3) =--&lt;), there will be no
legal role assignment. In these cases, our system
returns local SRL results.
Soft Constraint Re-ranking In this approach,
the predicted confidence score of relations is
added as factor items to the score function of the
semantic role assignment. Formally, the score
function in soft constraint re-ranking is:

We evaluated our system using the CoNLL-2005

2.1. Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) is used for
POS tagging and full parsing. UIUC Semantic
Role Labeler 1 is a state-of-the-art SRL system. Its
argument classification module is used as a strong
local semantic role classifier. This module is re-
trained in our SRC experiments, using parameters
described in (Koomen et al., 2005). Experiments
of SRC in this paper are all based on good ar-
gument boundaries which can filter out the noise
raised by argument identification stage.

Hierarchy labels for experimental corpora are automatically set according to the definition of relation labels described in section 2.1. Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) is used for POS tagging and full parsing. UIUC Semantic Role Labeler 1 is a state-of-the-art SRL system. Its argument classification module is used as a strong local semantic role classifier. This module is retrained in our SRC experiments, using parameters described in (Koomen et al., 2005). Experiments of SRC in this paper are all based on good argument boundaries which can filter out the noise raised by argument identification stage. 4.2 Which Hierarchy Is Better?

For example, a predicate will have no more than one Agent in most cases. It is reasonable to label one argument while taking into account other arguments. More structural information of all arguments should be encoded in SRL approaches. This paper explores structural information of predicate-argument structure from the perspective of rank relations between arguments. Thematic hierarchy theory argues that there exists a language independent rank of possible semantic roles, which establishes priority among arguments with respect to their syntactic realization (Levin and Hovav, 2005). This construct has been widely implicated in linguistic phenomena, such as in the subject selection rule of Fillmore’s Case Grammar (1968): ”If there is an A [=Agent], it becomes the subject; otherwise, if there is an I [=Instrument], it becomes the subject; otherwise, the subject is the O [=Object, i.e., Patient/Theme]”. This rule implicitly establishes precedence relations among semantic roles mentioned and can be simplified to: Agent &gt;- Instrument &gt;- Patient/Theme Emerging from a range of more basic semantic properties of the ranked semantic roles, thematic hierarchies can help to constru</context>

On the one hand, there is no consistent meaning of the core roles (i.e. Arg0-5/ArgA). On the other hand, there is no consensus over hierarchies of the roles in the thematic hierarchy. For example, the Patient occupies the second highest hierarchy in some linguistic theories but the lowest in some other theories (Levin and Hovav, 2005). In this paper, the proto-role theory (Dowty, 1991) is taken into account to rank PropBank arguments, partially resolving the two problems above. There are three key points in our solution. First, the rank of Arg0 is the highest. The Agent is almost without exception the highest role in proposed hierarchies. Though PropBank defines semantic roles on a verb by verb basis, for a particular verb, Arg0 is generally the argument exhibiting features of a prototypical Agent while Arg1 is a prototypical Patient or Theme (Palmer et al., 2005). As being the proto-Agent, the rank of Arg0 is higher than </context>

As being the proto-Agent, the rank of Arg0 is higher than other numbered arguments. Second, the rank of the Arg1 is second highest or lowest. Both hierarchy of Arg1 are tested and discussed in section 4. Third, we do not rank other arguments. Two sets of roles closely correspond to numbered arguments: 1) referenced arguments and 2) continuation arguments. To adapt the relation to help these two kinds of arguments, the equivalence relation is divided into several sub-categories. In summary, relations of two arguments ai and aj in this paper include: 1) ai &gt;- aj: ai is higher than aj, 2) ai � </context>

In other words, the position information is implicitly encoded in the model rather than explicitly as a feature. The system extracts a number of features to represent various aspects of the syntactic structure of a pair of arguments. All features are listed in Table 1. The Path features are designed as a sequential collection of phrase tags by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). We also use Single Character Category Path, in which each phrase tag is clustered to a category defined by its first character (Pradhan et al., 2005). To characterize the relation between two constituents, we combine features of the two individual arguments as new features (i.e. conjunction features). For example, if the category of the first argument is NP and the category of the second is S, then the conjunction of category feature is NP-S. 3 Re-ranking Models for SRC Toutanova et al.
