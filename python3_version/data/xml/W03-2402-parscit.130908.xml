In this paper we present some specific problems
concerning the annotation of a Spanish treebank.
It is our aim to build a 100,000-word Spanish tree-
bank (Cast3LB) which will be enriched in the fu-
ture with semantic as well as pragmatic informa-
tion, and which will be free for research purposes.
The construction of such a treebank is part of the
3LB projectl , funded by the Spanish government,
whose goals are to build three treebanks: one for
Catalan (Cat3LB), one for Spanish (Cast3LB)
and finally another for Basque (Eus3LB).
To start working with our corpus we need a se-
ries of NLP tools described in (Civit and Marti,
2002): a morphological analyser, a tagger and a
chunker for Spanish. In order to build the tree-
bank the AGTK toolkit (Cotton and Bird, 2002) is
being used, since it allows us to use our tagset and
our chunker output.
I PROFIT (FIT-150500-2002-244);

There are four levels of annotation:
level 1: syntactic annotation: constituents;
level 2: syntactic annotation: functions;
level 3: semantic annotation: words senses;
level 4: pragmatic annotation: coreference.
This paper is centered on the first level: annotation
of syntactic constituents.
In the establishment of our framework we have
taken into account preceding works covering a
wide range of languages in order to cope with dif-
ferent kinds of syntactic phenomena: (Abeill &apos;e et
al., 2002), (Bies et al., 1995), (Brants et al., 2002),
(Hajic, 1998), (Montemagni et al., 2001), (Moreno
et al., 2001)2.
Our main goal has been to define consistent
criteria for the syntactic annotation (Civit, 2002),
especially in what concerns the treatment of co-
ordination, comparative structures, complex verb
forms, etc. and the establishment of general prin-
ciples to handle with some specific problems such
as punctuation marks that, so far, have neither re-
ceived an homogeneous nor an unified treatment.
These are the points we concentrate on in this pa-
per.

Corpus Linguistics and more concretely the de-
velopment of treebanks have a short background.
That is why there is not a well-established method-
ology for developing such linguistic resources.
There is a wide range of choices for researchers

freely available and that the annotaions we propose are com-
pletely different.

when the definition of the annotation criteria is to
be done, or the units of analysis and the repre-
sentation system are to be chosen. In Cast3LB
we follow an incremental process in the levels of
annotation. We have taken decisions in order to
make our system flexible and transportable to dif-
ferent romance languages and to new cases that
may appear, but also consistent in all levels of an-
notation and with regard to linguistic data. This
viewpoint justifies the methodological decisions
presented in what follows.
We annotate explicit elements and only add new
nodes for elliptical subjects of finite sentences.
Since Spanish is a pro-drop language, the subject
may not appear explicitly, although it is always
recoverable from verbal inflexion because of the
agreement in person and number with the verb.
Information about the subject is necessary espe-
cially for further annotation of anaphora and coref-
erence. Apart from that, we do not add new nodes
to the tree (see section 3.1 for more details about
this phenomenon).
As for concrete annotation of sentences, it
should be noticed that we do not alter the sur-
face word order of elements because it could mean
a loss of pragmatic information. However, hav-
ing taken this decision, we need to face different
problems, all of them related to discontinuous con-
stituents. We have adopted some conventions to
mark the syntactic function of such elements (see
section 3.3).
We decided to follow the constituency annota-
tion scheme, instead of annotating dependencies.
Constituency seems better for Spanish, which is a
free constituent order language but has a quite fix
word order within the constituents.
We do not only label constituents with tags such
as noun phrase, prepositional phrase, etc., but also
give them a functional tag subject, object, etc3.
However, we do not deal with nominal comple-
ments. Our main goal now is to acquire knowl-
edge of language performance in real text in order
to infer a full and deep grammar for Spanish and
to build a verbal lexicon with subcategorisation in-
formation.
Due to this reason, we do not follow any con-

crete theoretical framework. Instead, we want
Cast3LB to be useful for as many people as pos-
sible, linguists as well as computer scientists or
anyone interested in the Spanish language.
Verbal phrases pose a very in-depth problem re-
garding the relationship between the verb and its
arguments and between the subject and the ver-
bal phrase. Theoretically speaking, the latter con-
tains the verb, its arguments and some of the ad-
juncts, so this situation should be reflected in the
syntactic annotation. We found several reasons to
justify the decision of not taking into considera-
tion the verbal phrase node and to adopt a more
neutral solution in which all the main constituents
of the sentence (subject, verb, arguments and ad-
juncts) are daugthers of the root node. Firstly, lan-
guage use shows that in many cases it is not easy to
differentiate between arguments and adjuncts (as
stated in (Marcus et al., 1994)). Secondly, there
is a long discussion about whether the subject is
an argument or not. Thirdly, there is a lack of a
wide coverage lexicon for Spanish with rich infor-
mation about argument structure of verbs. Finally,
since, in Spanish adjuncts can appear at any place
of the sentence, we should alter the surface word
order to reflect this relationship. All in all, as said
above, our decision was not to take into consider-
ation the verbal phrase and give a quite flat repre-
sentation of sentences4,5:

4This is the real representation of trees. However, in order
to simplify the examples, in what follows we provide simpler
forms of analysed sentences. Moreover, tags for syntactic
functions appear only when functions are involved; if not, we
only reproduce the constituent labeling.

3 Issues in the annotation process
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996454">
In this paper we would like to concentrate on
concrete issues on annotation, those that showed
a high degree of variation among the different
Cast3LB annotators. We discuss here problems
concerning the general structure of the sentence:
ellipsis, punctuation marks, complex verb forms
and some kinds of structures such as comparative
clauses and coordinated elements. In next subsec-
tions these problems are discussed and the adopted
solution is given.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.97359">
3.1 Ellipsis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967872838709678">
Ellipsis is a phenomenon that may appear in all the
sentence constituents. Only subject ellipsis is re-
covered in our framework (see section 2). In the
other cases, no node is added to the trees. The
main reasons for such a decision are that we do
not wish to alter linguistic data from corpus; that
recovering elliptical elements requires subjective
interpretation and results may differ among anno-
tators; that there is a huge amount of such elements
and one may find more elliptical elements than ex-
plicit ones; and, finally, that one should follow one
grammatical theory. However, when the elliptical
element is the verb, we mark the sentence node
with a * symbol. The rest of the cases are left un-
specified.
We can distinguish four main cases in verbal
ellipsis. The first one happens in coordinated
clauses sharing the same verb. In this case the
second clause has no verbal form (example-1). A
second case of elliptical verb appears in coordi-
nated sentences having a complex verb form: an
auxiliary finite verb and a main verb in a non-
finite form. In this case, the auxiliary verb may be
elided in the second sentence (example-2). A third
kind of verbal ellipsis occurs in comparative sen-
tences, because they share the verb with the main
clause too (example-3). Finally, in general, this
phenomenon may occur in any kind of sentence,

cussion about the general framework.

3.2 Punctuation marks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994046722222222">
In the tradition of Corpus Linguistics, punctuation
marks are considered one among other elements
of the text and are usually treated as another class
of words (i.e. they receive a specific tag). In the
Cast3LB framework, they maintain their POS-tag
and no more labels are added to them at the syn-
tactic annotation level.
Up to now, the solution they have received has
been limited to the place they fill in the tree. In
the literature (see (Bies et al., 1995), (Abeill&apos;e et
al., 2002) and (Moreno et al., 1999)) different so-
lutions are proposed, all of them being different.
It is true that strong marks (full stop, question and

exclamation marks8 and three dots) usually are the
last element of the sentence; but, as for medium
marks (colons, semicolons and commas), given
solutions differ extensively.
If we concentrate on colons, in the PennTree-
Bank guidelines (Bies et al., 1995) only two &apos;pos-
sibilities&apos; are presented: colons in appositions and
colorful environments. In the Spanish treebank
(Moreno et al., 1999), colons are treated the same
way than other punctuation marks: they will be the
sister or the daugther of their closer constituent,
depending on their position inside the sentence.
Finally, in the Corpus Le Monde (Abeill&apos;e et al.,
2002) it is stated that colons, and punctuation
marks in general, are usually not included inside
any constituent. However, some commas belong
to the subordinate clauses.
Handling with punctuation marks is not a triv-
ial matter, and if one wants to provide a consis-
tent annotation, a critical analysis about this issue
is required. We have endeavoured to relate their
place in the tree with the function they have in
the sentence. In some cases, punctuation marks
are used for delimiting and identifying a specific
structure. In other cases, they provide some kind
of semantics to the understanding of the whole
sentence. In the first case, our general rule is to
include the punctuation mark in the node it paren-
thesises: at the beginning or at the end of subor-
dinated clauses; at the beginning and at the end of
parenthetical elements; etc. In coordinations with-
out conjunctions, punctuation marks are given the
same place than conjunctions; in the other cases,
they are siblings of the coordinated nodes.
The second case refers mostly to colons, which
we interpret differently taking into account their
semantics. According to the correct use stated by
the Spanish Academy of Language the main uses
they have in Spanish are the following: before or
after an enumeration; as introductory elements of
direct speech; as a delimiter of an example from
the rest of the sentence; and, in general, as connec-
tive elements to link clauses, which may express
different relationships: cause, consequence, con-
clusion, summary, explanation of what precedes,
etc.
8Notice than in Spanish these marks appear at the begin-
ning and at the end of the sentence.
In order to systematise the analysis of colons,
we extracted 35 sentences containing colons out
of the corpus. After a detailed analysis we get this
typology:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99494875">
1. Colons introduce direct speech. Then, they
are treated as if they were a subordinating
conjunction and so are the first element of a
completive clause.

<listItem confidence="0.980003666666667">
2. Colons are the beginning (sometimes the
end) of an enumeration. This is the so-called
shopping-list model, and is, by far, the most
frequent use of colons. Here, they are the first
element of the series (example a) or the last,
if the series precedes the head (example b).

Four of the found examples did not match ex-
actly any of the described situations, but they
showed similar characteristics.
We consider all of them as belonging to the
shopping-list kind, but the noun they referred to
did not immediately precede them. For instance,
Los demas ya son conocidos: la composicion del resto
del podio, la probabilidad de que Toni_Rominger se apunte
tambien la montatia y la regularidad.13
In these cases, we adopted the adjunction model
representation, even though, conceptually speak-
ing, they should be sorted out in the second group.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.981888">
3.3 Complex verb forms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996402025">
The Spanish language has an important number
of so-called periphrastic verb forms. These are a
combination of a finite verb form, optionally fol-
lowed by a preposition or a conjunction, plus a
non-finite verb form. The finite form gives the in-
flexion and adds some modal meaning; the non-
finite one not only brings the meaning of the com-
pound but also selects the complements of the
whole form.
The grammar used by the chunker deals with
the main periphrastic forms in Spanish. A set of
35 different complex verb forms was established
there. However, periphrastic phenomenon is more
a continuum than a set of clear-cut cases. Two of
the main tests to check whether a given sequence
of verbs is a periphrasis are: (1) it is not possible to
substitute the non-finite verb form by a pronoun or
a nominal expression; (2) clitics might appear be-
fore or after the whole compound. Let&apos;s consider
the sentence
desea comprar an libro14.
It is possible to replace the infinitive form (coin-
prar) and its complements by a demonstrative pro-
noun, even by a clitic: desea esto / lo desea15. In-
stead, in
puede comprar an libro 16
the substitution of the infinitive is impossible, and,
however, it is possible to substitute el libro by
a clitic, which may appear after or before the
compound: puede comprarlo / lo puede comprar.
Such substitution is also possible in the first exam-
ple, but the clitic has to appear after the compound:
desea comprarlo / *lo desea comprar.
Although almost all the examples conform to
the rules, there are some cases in which one of the
two rules does not work. This happens with the se-
quence querer + infinitive17, like in the sentence
quiere comprar un libro 18.
On the one hand, the clitic accepts the two posi-
tions: to quiere comprar—quiere comprarlo; but on
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9987964">
14fle/she wishes to buy a book.
15He/she wishes this / it.

18&apos;He/she wants to buy a book&apos;.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.999345">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994355">
the other, the infinitive admits to be replaced by a
pronoun: quiere esto19
There are some other middle-case periphrases
like this one. As a general criterion we decided to
consider complex verb forms only those following
the two criteria, so querer + infinitive will not be
considered as a periphrasis.
In this case, we will find sequences such as clitic
+ inflected verb + infinitive20 where the clitic de-
pends on the infinitive. Given our flat represen-
tation of sentences, we face here a discontinuous
constituent: the clitic is the direct object of the in-
finitive, which is the direct object of the finite verb
form. The solution taken in the Cast3LB frame-
work is to adopt a convention to mark this relation
in the functional tag (CD.NF):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.924424333333333">
lo quiere comprar:
S_[
sn.e-SUBJ [ *0*
sn-CD.NF_[ lo ]
cav_[ quiere
S.NF.C-CD_[ comprar
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998367">
Periphrastic forms entail other problems. Even
if they behave as compounds, it is quite usual in
Spanish to find embedded adverbs or noun phrases
in the compound:
puede quizci comprar / puede alguien comprar21.
As we do not alter the word order, these atypical
verbal groups having a non-verbal element in the
middle are analysed as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.976416833333333">
gv_[ puede

where the embedded element appears between
the auxiliary verb form and the infinitive.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.965687">
3.4 Comparative sentences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.792606666666667">
Comparative structures epitomize discontinuous
constituents. In Spanish, more than in English,
comparison is a syntactic phenomenon22. In the

basic case, adverbs mcis / menos23 depend on an
adjective and then the conjunction que24 intro-
duces the comparative clause:
se muestren mcis frcigiles que la moral del suizo25
Moreover, the clause has only one element, usu-
ally a noun phrase and the rest of the structure has
to be inferred from the first part of the sentence.
Spanish linguistic tradition considers comparative
clauses to be sentential adjuncts (together with
conditionals, concessive and consecutive clauses).
However, in our framework, comparative elements
are adjoined to the element containing the compar-
ative adverb. The reason why we do so is because
we think that we cannot split both elements (the
adverb and the conjunction) in two different con-
stituents; so the analysis for the sentence is:

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999742666666667">
As shown in the example, the comparative
clause belongs to the same constituent than the ad-
jective in an adjoined structure.

3.5 Coordinated elements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992764705882">
We consider coordinated elements to be equivalent
in the syntactic structure, so they are always rep-
resented as siblings (i.e. there is no head in coor-
dinated structures). The tag of the mother node is
the same than that for the daughters with the suffix
.co. However, sometimes it happens that siblings
do not belong to the same grammatical category.
In this case we give the mother the less marked
tag of her daughters according to their syntactic
function. For instance, if coordinated nodes are
an adverbial and a prepositional phrase (sadv and
sp), the mother node is sadv.co, if the structure is
a verb complement; instead, if it is a noun comple-
ment the tag is sp.co. If coordinated nodes are an
adverbial sentence with a finite verb form (S.F.A)
and an adverbial sentence with a non-finite verb
form (S.NF.A), the tag for the mother is S.F.A.co.

Sometimes, in coordinated sentences, there is
a shared complement: compra y vende casas26
As in our framework we have as many sentences
as verbal forms, the only way to show that casas
depends on the two verbs is to include the noun
phrase as a daughter of the coordinated node:

Sometimes, however, the two coordinated verbs
have different structures, and one of them requires
a preposition for the complement while the other
does not: ... minando o acabando con sus Hu-
.siones27 . In this case, the solution has been to
attach the prepositional phrase only to the sec-
ond verb, even though, semantically speaking, the
complement is related to both verbal forms:

4 Conclusions and futher work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99817">
In this paper we have presented some of the cru-
cial problems concerning the syntactic annotation
of corpora in Spanish. So far, there are 2,300 an-
notated sentences with constituent and functional
labels. Further work will consist, on the one hand,
on the semantic tagging of nouns, verbs and ad-
jectives using Spanish EuroWordNet (Alonge et
al., 1998) and, on the other, on the annotation of
anaphora and correference phenomena.

In the Cast3LB framework, they maintain their POS-tag and no more labels are added to them at the syntactic annotation level. Up to now, the solution they have received has been limited to the place they fill in the tree. In the literature (see (Bies et al., 1995), (Abeill&apos;e et al., 2002) and (Moreno et al., 1999)) different solutions are proposed, all of them being different.

The construction of such a treebank is part of the 3LB projectl , funded by the Spanish government, whose goals are to build three treebanks: one for Catalan (Cat3LB), one for Spanish (Cast3LB) and finally another for Basque (Eus3LB). To start working with our corpus we need a series of NLP tools described in (Civit and Marti, 2002): a morphological analyser, a tagger and a chunker for Spanish. In order to build the treebank the AGTK toolkit (Cotton and Bird, 2002) is being used, since it allows us to use our tagset and our chunker output.

Theoretically speaking, the latter contains the verb, its arguments and some of the adjuncts, so this situation should be reflected in the syntactic annotation. We found several reasons to justify the decision of not taking into consideration the verbal phrase node and to adopt a more neutral solution in which all the main constituents of the sentence (subject, verb, arguments and adjuncts) are daugthers of the root node. Firstly, language use shows that in many cases it is not easy to differentiate between arguments and adjuncts (as stated in (Marcus et al., 1994)). Secondly, there is a long discussion about whether the subject is an argument or not. Thirdly, there is a lack of a wide coverage lexicon for Spanish with rich information about argument structure of verbs. Finally, since, in Spanish adjuncts can appear at any place of the sentence, we should alter the surface word order to reflect this relationship. All in all, as said above, our decision was not to take into consideration the verbal phrase and give a quite flat representation of sentences4,5: (S (an (espec.fs (diOfs0 Una)) (grup.nom.fs (ncfs000 informaci6n) (s.a.fs (agOfs0 periodistica)))</context>
