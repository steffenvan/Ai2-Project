ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999445958333333">
This study presents an original and penetrat-
ing analysis of the complex problems surround-
ing the automatic generaton of natural language
text. Laurence Danlos provides a valuable criti-
cal review of current research in this important
and increasingly active field, and goes on to
describe a new theoretical model that is
thoroughly grounded in linguistic principles.
The model emphasizes the semantic, syntac-
tic and lexical constraints that must be dealt
with when establishing a relationship between
meaning and form, and it is consideration of
such linguistic constraints that determines
Danlos&apos; generation algorithm. The book con-
cludes with a description of a generation system
based on this algorithm which produces texts in
several domains and also a system for the syn-
thesis of spoken messages from semantic
representations.
The book is a significant addition to the
literature on text generation, and will be of par-
ticular interest to all computational linguists
and Al researchers who have wrestled with the
problem of vocabulary selection.
