The problem of style is highly relevant to computational linguistics, but current systems deal
only superficially, if at all, with subtle but significant nuances of language. Expressive effects,
together with their associated meaning, contained in the style of a text are lost to analysis and
absent from generation.
We have developed an approach to the computational treatment of style that is intended
to eventually incorporate three selected components—lexical, syntactic, and semantic. In this
paper, we concentrate on certain aspects of syntactic style. We have designed and implemented a
computational theory of goal-directed stylistics that can be used in various applications, including
machine translation, second-language instruction, and natural language generation.
We have constructed a vocabulary of style that contains both primitive and abstract elements
of style. The primitive elements describe the stylistic effects of individual sentence components.
These elements are combined into patterns that are described by a stylistic meta-language, the
abstract elements, that define the concordant and discordant stylistic effects common to a group of
sentences. Higher-level patterns are built from the abstract elements and associated with specific
stylistic goals, such as clarity or concreteness. Thus, we have defined rules for a syntactic stylistic
grammar at three interrelated levels of description: primitive elements, abstract elements, and
stylistic goals. Grammars for both English and French have been constructed, using the same
vocabulary and the same development methodology. Parsers that implement these grammars have
also been built.
The stylistic grammars codify aspects of language that were previously defined only descrip-
tively. The theory is being applied to various problems in which the form of an utterance conveys
an essential part of meaning and so must be precisely represented and understood.

<bodyText confidence="0.99989925">
Understanding a text requires more than just understanding its propositional content.
It requires a sensitivity to the interaction of semantic content, emotional expression,
and interpersonal and situational attitudes. This interaction is reflected in the style of
the text. Style in language is not just surface appearance, a decorative veneer. Rather, it
is an essential part of meaning, part of the author&apos;s communication to the reader. So to
fully understand the nuances of a text, one must determine not only the propositional
content, but also how its communicative effect is colored by the form, which reflects
affective content. While propositional content provides the basic tone, the expressive

form provides the tonal quality. Together, form and content create style, that which
distinguishes both an individual text and a collective body of writing.
Style is created through subtle variation, seemingly minor modulations of exactly
what is said, the words used to say it, and the syntactic constructions employed, but
the resulting effect on communication can be striking. Consider the following versions
of the same text, Matthew 7:27:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9991361">
1. And descended the storm and came the floods and blew the winds and
beat against that house and it fell and the fall of it was great. (Literal
translation of the Hellenistic Greek.)
2. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. (Revised
Standard Version, 1952.)
3. The rain came down, the floods rose, the wind blew, and beat upon that
house; down it fell with a great crash. (The New English Bible, 1970.)
4. Rain came down, floods rose, gales blew and struck that house, and it
fell; and what a fall it had! (The New Jerusalem Bible, 1985.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.976129586206896">
5. The rains fell, the torrents came, the winds blew and lashed against his
house. It collapsed under all this and was completely ruined. (The New
American Bible, 1973.)
The first variation, a word-by-word translation from the Hellenistic Greek, is actually
a good deal less striking than subsequent, widely accepted versions. The placement
of the verbs before their subjects is quite normal and the closing is also quite usual.
The sense of discord and resulting poetic effect is not as evident as it is in the second
variation, from the Revised Standard Version, which is resoundingly poetic in the
imitative form of the first five clauses, followed by the inverted form of the final clause.
The text begins in strong concord and dissolves into discord, but not unpleasingly so.
Discord, as we use the term in this paper, refers to a deviation from the norm, but such
deviations can be used to good effect. As we will see, in language as in music, it is often
through the construction of patterns of concord and discord, particular combinations
of order and disorder that create an overall harmonious arrangement, that certain
stylistic effects are achieved.
In versions 3 and 4, the dramatic effect of the closing has been retained from the
RSV translation but through different choices of words and structure. In 3, the last
clause is inverted, but the translator has chosen to place more emphasis upon the
fall itself (down it fell) than its magnitude (great). Example 4 ends on an intense note,
achieved through the use of an exclamation (what a fall it had!), rather than an inversion
of syntactic structure. And no single word expresses the degree of magnitude of the
fall. In the final example, 5, the drama and intensity of the RSV has been lost with
the removal of the dissolution from initial concord to final discord. In this case, the
translator has opted for plainness and clarity, even at the expense of beauty.
In English, example 1 sounds odd and disjointed; and examples 2, 3, and 4 are
dramatic in a way that example 5 is not. But all have the same essential content. What
then causes the differences in effect? What is being varied? There are at least four
parameters that play a role in these stylistic variations: lexical, syntactic, thematic, and
semantic aspects.

Lexical aspects: Compare example 4 to the following constructed versions:1

The differences between 4, 6, and 7 are primarily lexical. Example 6 uses rather ele-
gant words, while 7 opts for a more commonplace vocabulary, and 4 lies somewhere
between the two in lexical formality.
Syntax: Comparing example 2 to example 5, we see that the former uses syntactic
structures that create more dramatic effects: a short climactic sentence, and it fell, and
a striking inversion, great was the fall of it, close the text on a powerful note. In contrast,
5 ends with a very ordinary, unremarkable, construction.
Thematic aspects: Comparing example 2 to example 3, we observe that the two sen-
tence structures bring different elements into focus: greg was the fall of it, in contrast
to down it fell with a great crash. In general, variations in thematic structure can create
different stylistic effects.
Semantics: The exact choice of what is said, or not said, also has stylistic consequences.
Compare example 4 to the following two constructed versions:

of rain, flood, and wind were too great and caused so much structural
damage that the house collapsed.
These variations differ in their semantic content: example 4 merely reports the events,
but 8 evaluates, a serious storm, while 9 emphasizes technical details, structural damage.
These semantic differences are reflected in the texts; and stylistic differences result.
Given that these four parameters—lexical choice, syntax, theme, and semantics—
control stylistic variations, two questions arise:

<listItem confidence="0.9984595">
• How do we characterize each type of variation?
• How does each variation contribute to an overall stylistic effect?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998456833333333">
In considering these questions in this paper, we will concentrate on variations of the
syntactic parameter.
We emphasize that our intent here is not any form of literary analysis or literary
theory. Our main concern will be ordinary, everyday text. It is true that, in the Biblical
texts above, we saw how different syntactic forms carry different stylistic import to the
point that one form may be poetry while another is just dull, plodding prose. But style

isn&apos;t just a matter of achieving poetry or not. Every text, large or small, interesting or
dull, effective or not, has its own style. Nor are we talking about style in any of its
normative senses: the common tenets dictating standard forms (e.g., Chicago 1982), or
the textbook prescriptions for &apos;good&apos; style: be clear, be simple, be precise (e.g., Strunk
and White 1979). For people aim to convince, to persuade, to impress, and, even,
sometimes to obscure, and standard textbooks tell us very little about such varied and
subtle stylistic and pragmatic goals.
Rather than a study of literary or normative style, our intent is to determine
what gives any ordinary piece of text its stylistic &apos;feel.&apos; The following examples will
demonstrate what we have in mind. These texts are all from newspaper feature articles:
10. Silvia, a commanding woman in her 50&apos;s, a shrew falsely mellowed by
religion, promptly organized prayer sessions on the lines of Tupperware
meetings.&apos;
11. The artist provides a dreamy background done in yellow and bistre
brushstrokes to a blue gown with woodenly rigid folds or the profile of
a brown angel painted so mineral hard and modeled so carefully that the
incoherence of virtue does it injury.&apos;
12. Crazed with fear, he tried to purify her by dunking her in the ocean and
holding her under the water; then in desperation he threw her on the
still-smoking pyre.&apos;
In a newspaper, we might have expected the writer and translator to have simply
aimed for clarity. In fact, we find a variety of effects. The first text, 10, emphasizes a
sense of harmony by repeating the same kind of structure, a nominal group, in the
postmodification of Silvia. The second, 11, is more complex, and achieves a certain
balance in the judicious use of conjunctions; but the result is so difficult to understand
that it doesn&apos;t really make sense. Text 12 has a stark initial participle clause, crazed
with fear, that emphasizes the intensity of the subject&apos;s emotional state.
To account for the kinds of complex stylistic effects that occur even in everyday
writing, we propose a goal-directed understanding of style. That is, an author&apos;s in-
tent can vary with respect to a number of stylistic goals, such as clarity or obscurity,
abstraction or concreteness, staticness or dynamism. Particular choices of words, syn-
tactic structure, and semantic structure make a text more—or less—stylistically varied
and effective. We believe that these choices, goals such as abstraction or concreteness,
and the stylistic elements that are used to realize them can be recognized and repre-
sented in a formal notation. They are, in a word, codifiable. It is this codification that
is at the heart of computational stylistics.&apos;

5 The term computational stylistics has been used by Milic (1982) to describe what might better be called
computer-aided stylistics, in which computer-generated data and pattern-matching aid human analysis
and judgment of style in literary studies (see Section 2.2). In contrast, our use of the term entails fully
automatic computer analysis of the style of any kind of text.

and de Souza 1990). Even after the propositional content has been decided upon, there
are still many linguistic, syntactic, and even semantic decisions that the language pro-
ducer must make before a sentence can be formed. These decisions are assumed by
the audience not to have been made randomly, but rather in specific, deliberate ways
that encode additional information, such as opinion, emotional affect, and interper-
sonal relationships.&apos; To the extent that a piece of text exhibits a particular, recognizable
style, it also reflects the author&apos;s presumed intent to convey the effect associated with
that style. Therefore, full understanding of a text must represent not only propositional
content, but also stylistic effects.
This becomes most apparent in the case of machine translation. If a translation is
to be faithful, the stylistic effects of the source language text must be transferred to the
target language text, making appropriate use of the stylistic conventions of the target
language. But a dilemma arises:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.893846">
• One wants to preserve the original author&apos;s stylistic intent, the

information being conveyed through the manner of presentation.
However, different languages might realize this effect in different ways.
So the source and target texts should both aim for the author&apos;s stylistic
goal, but might have to achieve it through different linguistic means.&apos;

&apos;natural&apos; way to express an idea. For example, French tends to prefer
more abstraction, English more concreteness (Vinay and Darbelnet 1958).
The best translation, therefore, might modify the original author&apos;s stylistic
intent and express a different effect.
Sometimes, there is no way to resolve this dilemma, and one is left with an unsat-
isfactory translation. But, with a knowledge of the comparative stylistics of a language
pair, and of the stylistic resources of each language and the possible range of effects
they can create, one can substantially improve the quality of a translation.

Our goal is to create a formal representation of stylistics for use in natural language
systems, and, moreover, to do so in a manner applicable to different languages. The
solution we will propose is a codification of syntactic stylistic knowledge in the form
of a stylistic grammar.
In the next section, we will review the current status of the codification of style.
In Section 3, we will construct a vocabulary for stylistics. The definition of concepts
and the attempt to organize them into a recognizable structure is a necessary first step
toward understanding the problem. Then we will develop in Section 4 a methodology
for converting stylistic knowledge into a formal representation. The methodology will

6 Thus the speaker or writer is accountable for his or her stylistic decisions, in the sense that that term is
used in Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis. A person encountering friends on the street,
for example, may choose to greet them or not, but is held accountable either way—failure to greet is a
snub; it is not possible to opt out of the situation altogether (Heritage 1984). Similarly, a speaker or
writer is accountable for all the stylistic nuances of his or her utterances; it is not possible to utter a
sentence in such a way that only the propositional content counts and not the form in which it is
expressed.

expressed lexically in one language may be realized through syntactic means in the other, and vice
versa&amp;quot; (Vinay and Darbelnet 1958, p. 185, authors&apos; translation).

tence and paragraph levels; appropriate for lexical, syntactic, and semantic style; and
applicable to both English and French. The methodology will be used in conjunction
with the stylistic vocabulary to guide the systematic collection and creation of stylistic
rules. This grammar will provide a formal description of the syntactic patterns that
differentiate the various stylistic goals.
In addition to theoretical problems, there are implementation issues to be ad-
dressed as well. In Section 5, we will describe the development of a stylistic parser that
uses the formal bodies of rules to analyze complex English text.

2. Background to the Study of Style
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999086">
2.1 Views of Style
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989574411764706">
2.1.1 The Classical View. The study of style has an ancient history, for the concept
first appeared in the fifth century B.C. Scholars of the time conceived the notion that
the rhetorical form of a writer&apos;s text should reflect his thoughts and intentions. This
was to be achieved through the appropriate choice and organization of words and
syntactic structures in order to &amp;quot;evoke the desired response&amp;quot; (Corbett 1971). Content
and form were recognized as inseparable, and as exerting a reciprocal influence upon
each other.
Beginning with Corax of Syracuse, rhetoricians developed methods for systematic
instruction in the art of writing. The classical scholars, from Isocrates and Aristotle
to Cicero and Quintilian, established standards of rhetoric that influenced curricula
for centuries. The contribution of Aristotle was particularly notable. He countered
Plato&apos;s argument that rhetoric was mere sophistry, deceitful reasoning, by providing a
system of instruction that treated the theory and practice of style as a valid discipline,
designed to appeal simultaneously to reason and emotion.
This classical approach to style flourished into the Middle Ages, for it formed part
of a standard university education. The teaching of formal rhetoric in schools and
universities continued to play a significant role throughout the Renaissance and into
the 18th century. However, in the 19th century, the teaching of rhetoric gave way to
the teaching of composition, which came to be associated merely with a set of basic
prescriptive rules. This approach was in direct contrast to the original classical theory
that stressed the education of the whole person as a preparation for achieving style in
writing (Corbett 1971).
2.1.2 The Modern View. Today, the common view of style is still one of conformity
to standard good taste and an avoidance of bad form. Textbooks (Fowler 1968; Strunk
and White 1979; Kane 1983; Grevisse 1986) promote the idea that there is a universal
and correct mode of expression. However, normative rules, while necessary in some
degree so that communication is possible at all, may, if too inflexible, deaden the
expression of a writer&apos;s individual voice. Universal rules of good style are best used,
we suggest, simply as a guide to avoiding bad constructions and obstacles to clear
writing, but not as a basis for a theory of stylistic effects in text.
2.1.3 Our View. In computational applications, where we expect to deal with large
amounts of similar types of text, the analysis of group style is of more interest than the
idiosyncratic style of any one writer. Group style can be subdivided into two major
types, each associated with a different view of stylistics: literary style and utilitarian

(or functional) style. Utilitarian group styles are distinguished from the literary type by
their association with a genre of text that has a particular function or purpose, such as
medical textbooks or political newspaper writing. In such styles, the writer adjusts her
language to what readers expect in a specific situation. The fact that functional group
styles are somewhat more restrictive than literary group styles, as they are characteristic
of a particular genre, suggests that the problem of codifying utilitarian style will be
more tractable than the literary case. For this reason, we will focus on utilitarian texts
in general, drawing most of our examples from newspaper and magazine journalism
(Our main source of examples is the English translations, published in The Guardian
Weekly,&apos; of articles from Le Monde.)

2.2 The Current State of Computational Stylistics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999786472222222">
Most of the research to date in computational stylistics has been the development
of so-called style-checkers. The UNIX-based Writer&apos;s Workbench, Grammatik I and II,
RightWriter, PC-Style, Punctuation and Style, Electric Webster, and CRITIQUE are ex-
amples (Raskin 1986). However, none of these systems is appropriate for our purposes.
These programs enforce the basic virtues: be clear, be simple, be precise. They merely
check for common grammatical errors such as number disagreement, pronoun case
problems, unbalanced punctuation, split infinitives, excessive sentence length, and ex-
cessive sentence complexity. There is no systematic approach to constructing a vocab-
ulary of style, no structured representation of stylistic rules. Stylistic knowledge may
simply consist, as in the case of CRITIQUE, of an unstructured mass of rules (Jensen
et al. 1986, p. 190). These programs have no real understanding of the significance of
stylistic parameters.
The other main kind of computational research in stylistics has been statistical (e.g.,
Cluett 1976, 1990; Milic 1982; Biber 1988, 1989). With this approach, a count is made of
the number of occurrences in a sample text of a stylistically significant feature, such
as an initial prepositional phrase. A statistical analysis is done to compare the count
and type of stylistic features with the corresponding parameters of texts written by
authors working in the same or different genres. But the interpretation of the statistical
results must be done by a human; the computer system has no real understanding of
what the variations in style mean.
Although virtually all computational research in stylistics takes a non-AI approach
to the representation and use of stylistic knowledge, the usefulness and degree of so-
phistication of some of these programs should not be underestimated. The York Com-
puter Inventory of Prose Style (Cluett 1976, 1990) has been undergoing development
since 1970. The principal contribution of the project is its convincing demonstration
that the richness and subtlety of literary style could in fact be correlated, to a perhaps
surprising degree of accuracy, with a catalog of syntactic patterns. But the program
that performs the stylistic analysis has no understanding of the meaning of its statis-
tical results; it relies on human interpretation of the statistics computed. Nevertheless,
the York project&apos;s findings are still very useful, as they have catalogued the syntactic
features that produce particular stylistic effects.
Thus, most current approaches in computational stylistics have not included for-
mal stylistic rules, which are clearly a desirable prerequisite. We now review the extent
to which such rules have been developed in theoretical stylistics and used in compu-
tational stylistics.

l&apos;anglais, is somewhat misleading, for their purpose was not just to deal with com-
parative stylistics in translation, but also to enumerate the more common rules and
procedures in the overall translation process. But they did not construct a specific vo-
cabulary for comparative stylistics and, in fact, virtually all of their &apos;stylistic&apos; terms refer
to basic syntactic constituents. Using their vocabulary of terms, Vinay and Darbelnet
defined rules, expressed in ordinary natural language, that encoded knowledge about
French—English comparative stylistics. The rules certainly fell short of the repertoire
needed by a professional translator, but no one has yet improved upon their codi-
fication of comparative stylistics (Brian Fitch, personal communication). Their book
is still used as a prescribed text in translation courses. Vinay and Darbelnet did not
take an explicitly goal-directed approach, but their book does contain a great deal of
information about the correlation of stylistic goals with particular lexical, syntactic,
and semantic choices. Unfortunately, however, their rules proved to be too language-
dependent for the framework that is proposed in this paper. But the success of a
goal-directed codification, albeit an implicit one, supports the approach that we will
take below.
Crystal and Davy (1969) hypothesized the creation of a formal stylistic grammar,
built upon a vocabulary of stylistic terms and intended to represent the sentence
structures characteristic of a particular stylistic sublanguage. However, the grammar
that they sketched contained virtually no terms other than purely syntactic ones and
no correlations with stylistic goals; it was only a first step, although an ambitious
one, toward a codification of the stylistic rules that define a sublanguage. What we
have found especially useful to adapt from their work is the overall methodology, the
approach to formalizing style, even the belief that style can be formalized
Kane&apos;s (1983) rhetoric and handbook of style represents the typical textbook that
aims to teach the rules of classic good writing. Kane, too, did not take an explicitly
goal-directed approach in his stylistic rules, but nevertheless gave numerous references
to the stylistic goals associated with particular syntactic structures. The systematic con-
struction of a stylistic vocabulary seems not to have been an explicit goal, but he used
many terms unique to stylistics. However, his terminology was apparently augmented
whenever the need arose to describe a new feature; there was no underlying struc-
ture, no formal representation of rules. The stylistic rules were expressed in ordinary
English and achieved, as the author intended, good coverage of plain writing style.
This body of rules was &apos;structured&apos; to the extent that there were hierarchies of stylistic
sentence types, but, in general, Kane&apos;s rules appear to be just an enumeration of stylis-
tic tenets, not a deliberately constructed organization. Nevertheless, we have found
it useful to draw upon these rules as justification for the syntactic coverage of our
grammar.
In computational stylistics, an application area of particular interest to us is ma-
chine translation (MT). In suggesting the applicability of computational stylistics to MT,
Loffler-Laurian (1986) emphasized an important point: although corresponding group
styles may exist across languages, the realization of the style can be different for each
language. Tsutsumi (1990) presented a methodology for bridging stylistic gaps (stylistic
differences) between the syntax of the source and target languages in MT. An impor-
tant contribution of Tsutsumi&apos;s work is the recognition that computational stylistics
is useful for the translation of pairs of languages that are not in the same language
group.
Hovy&apos;s (1988) PAULINE system was the first computational system that imple-
mented goal-directed style. PAULINE was able to generate text that conformed to vari-
ous stylistic and pragmatic constraints that it was given. The system was goal-directed,
able to correlate such stylistic goals as formality, simplicity, and respect with the lexical

and syntactic characteristics of the text produced. Hovy&apos;s method was based on the
definition of rhetorical goals of style, such as formality, force, and partiality, that control
broader pragmatic goals. For example, a low degree of formality combined with high
degrees of force and partiality gives a &apos;no-nonsense&apos; effect.
To achieve a particular rhetorical goal, PAULINE examined the options at various
points during the production of text and applied the appropriate strategies. For ex-
ample, to achieve formality, the generator would perform the following actions:
Organization of topics: Make long complex sentences by subordinating them in
relative clauses or by conjoining two or more sentence topics.
Organization of sentences: Make sentences seem weighty by including a number
of adverbial clauses, by placing these clauses toward the beginning of a
sentence, by building parallel clauses, by using the passive voice, by using
more &apos;complex&apos; tenses such as the perfect tenses, and by avoiding ellipsis.
Choice of words and phrases: Select formal words and phrases. Avoid doubtful
grammar, popular idioms, slang, and contractions.
Although structured in its correlation of the generator&apos;s actions with decision points,
this approach to representing a goal-directed knowledge of style is essentially heuristic.
Hovy&apos;s success in implementing a goal-based notion of style, even though lim-
ited in scope and informal in the mode of knowledge representation, encouraged our
development of a computational approach to goal-directed style.

<listItem confidence="0.803957611111111">
• From existing research in theoretical stylistics, we have seen that there is
a basis for the codification of group-based, utilitarian, goal-directed
stylistics.
• The need for a vocabulary of stylistic terms is an accepted idea.
However, the nature and structure of such a vocabulary for
computational use, which must describe more than basic syntax and be
amenable to systematic construction, have not yet been addressed. These
issues will be subjects of the next section.
• Similarly, while large bodies of stylistic rules already exist, they have not
been organized into the formal structure necessary to a computational
approach. Section 4 will develop a structured method for representing
stylistic rules by constructing formal grammars.
• The feasibility of a goal-directed analysis of style is supported by
previous research, but an actual goal-based codification has not
previously been attempted. In the grammar that we will develop in
Section 4, we will incorporate such a goal-directed knowledge of
stylistics.

understood clearly. We will construct a vocabulary from terms that are associated with
utilitarian, group-based, goal-directed stylistics. We will start by considering the kinds
of stylistic goals to be dealt with in the lexicon.
When a writer composes text, she has certain stylistic goals in mind; such goals
might include clarity, or informality, or even the clouding of an unpalatable message.
To achieve her various goals, she will choose specific words (outplacement or firing,
for example), syntactic constructions (heavily modified or sparse noun phrases), and
semantic organization (Thirty percent of the class failed or The majority of students passed).
In applications such as machine translation, we want to understand why a writer
has used language in a particular way, what specific effects she intended to convey,
and which linguistic choices were made to achieve these goals. There are a multitude
of goals that could be considered; indeed, the space of possibilities has never been
fully explored. For this study, we have chosen six goals that Vinay and Darbelnet
(1958) consider to be among the most commonly used, representing the opposite ends
of three dimensions. The goals are listed as follows, with an intuitive description of
the corresponding characteristics that a sentence of each type would display:

• Staticness: Uniformity, predictability, continuity.

3.2 From Theoretical Stylistics to Computational Stylistics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999685">
We will now develop a vocabulary of basic terms that will describe stylistically sig-
nificant aspects of syntax. Our development is guided by much in classical rhetorical
theory; often, our definitions will be extensions of those of the classical theory. We do
this in two stages: first, we outline abstract properties of style suggested by classical
rhetoric; second, we convert these properties into definitions of abstract elements that
will be used in a grammar of style.
Our starting point is the notion of stylistic norm, which is defined as the most
commonly used structures in a given genre. This notion is intrinsic to the work of the
majority of descriptive stylists such as Crystal and Davy (1969) and Cluett (1976, 1990).
From this, we derive the notions of stylistic concord and discord as the fundamental
principles of our formalization. Concord simply means conformity with the norm, and
discord, deviation from the norm.
Each genre has its own particular norm; for example, the style characteristic of
scientific texts may seem disruptive if used in general newspaper writing. This view
goes beyond the tenet of prescriptive rhetoric that the stylistic norm merely represents
standard, &apos;good,&apos; style, independent of the use of the text. Rather, we agree with
Lanham (1974) that style should be viewed as the tailoring of a text to a specific
audience and a specific situation; &apos;good&apos; style can in fact be quite inappropriate.
The concept of norm will be useful as a means of anchoring the development of
our stylistic rules. It is simply the usual, the typical, the stable and concordant. Indeed,
discord, deviation from the norm, will play an essential role in our formalization of
style, for it is our contention that style arises from the construction of patterns of

concord and discord, particular combinations of order and disorder that create an
overall harmonious arrangement (Crystal and Davy 1969; Cluett 1976, 1990).
3.2.1 The Divisions of the Vocabulary. As the first step in constructing a vocabulary
of style for computational use, we will look at the descriptive terms that stylists have
developed over many centuries of use.
One of the most important rhetorical influences on sentence style that has been
identified is syntactic parallelism, or coordination: the balancing of syntactically similar
forms to achieve a harmonious stylistic effect, an idea dating back to the rhetorical
schemes of balance (Corbett 1971, p. 463).
But if parallelism or coordination plays an important role in style, so too does
subordination: variations in the hierarchical structure of a sentence that can produce
correspondingly different stylistic effects. One part of a sentence can dominate an-
other. As with parallelism, the importance to style of syntactic hierarchy is also a
well-established principle in classical rhetoric, evident in the schemes of parenthesis,
apposition, and climax (Corbett 1971, pp. 466, 468, 476). Thus, modulations in coordinate
and subordinate structure are major factors in achieving stylistic expressiveness.
A third major contributor to syntactic style is linear ordering: varying the order
of components within a sentence to produce quite marked stylistic differences. The
rhetorical terms of anastrophe and parenthesis (Corbett 1971, p. 466) attest to the stylistic
importance of the ordering of sentence components.
Thus, we can see that three factors influencing syntactic style are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999996">
• Balance: Parallelism of structure.
• Dominance: Structural hierarchy.
• Position: Linear ordering of structure.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992070318181818">
We will adapt these factors from theoretical stylistics as the divisions of our vocabulary
of style. Now, we will classify commonly used stylistic terms into these three groups
in order to identify and abstract the general properties of style characteristic of each
group.
3.2.2 Abstract Properties of Style. In the balance group, we classify the terms symmetric
construction (Hendricks 1976), serial sentence (Kane 1983), parallel sentence (Kane 1983),
balanced sentence (Kane 1983), and intersentence coordination (Crystal and Davy 1969).
All of these terms suggest a stylistic imitation, the balancing of syntactically similar
clauses. We also find evidence of stylistic parallelism below the clause level in the use
of terms such as paired adjectives (Kane 1983), balanced phrases (Crystal and Davy 1969),
and intrasentence coordination (Hendricks 1976). As well as identifying similar struc-
tures, stylists have recognized characteristic asymmetric constructions (Hendricks 1976)
or syntactic counterpoint (Hendricks 1976). These types of structures are most often in-
terrupted or convoluted sentences (Kane 1983). For inclusion in our vocabulary, we will
choose the most representative terms in the balance group: intersentence coordination
and intrasentence counterpoint.
There are a variety of terms that can be classified into the dominance group. First,
there are sentences that have one trivially dominant clause. These are the simple sen-
tences (Kane 1983) that have only one main, or central, clause with no subordinate
clauses. Next, there are many and varied types of sentences built up around a central,
dominant clause. The complex sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause and at least
one dependent clause. The loose sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause followed by
</bodyText>

</page>
<note confidence="0.357564">

</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.998290208333333">
a subordinate clause. The centered sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause flanked by
subordinate clauses. The cumulative sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause accom-
panied by a series of appositive, modifying, or absolute constructions. Finally, there
are more-complicated sentences with more than one dominant clause. The compound-
complex sentence (Kane 1983) can be much more elaborate than a simple compound
sentence, as it contains at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent
clause. For inclusion in our vocabulary, we abstract from these three types of hierarchi-
cal terms to identify trivial single-clause dominance, complex single-clause dominance,
and multiple-clause dominance.
The position group appears to contain the largest number of terms, as any basic
term can be qualified to an arbitrarily fine degree by the exact intrasentence position to
which it refers. We will use only three qualifiers, associated with initial, medial, and final
positions (Quirk et al. 1985). At the sentence level, we can have any word or phrase in
initial, medial, or final position. Within the sentence, there are almost infinite variations
of position terms. A small sample includes postpositive adjectives, and pre-verbal, post-
verbal, or post-clause adverbs (Crystal and Davy 1969), and complex premodification and
postmodification (Crystal and Davy 1969). We will generalize from these many subtle
variations and define terms that have either a concordant or discordant effect, at a
particular position in a sentence, according to whether or not their usage is normal.
From this grouping of terms into the three divisions of balance, dominance, and
position, we have abstracted general properties of style that we want to describe in
our vocabulary. The abstract elements of style that we will now define will classify the
unstructured mass of stylistically significant sentence types into groups of sentences
with similar stylistic properties.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999941">
3.3 Abstract Elements of Style
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9844991">
We will present the abstract elements in three groups, according to their properties of
balance, dominance, and position, which we now define formally as follows:
Balance: A balance term characterizes a stylistic effect created by the juxtaposition
of similar or dissimilar sentence components.
For example, parallelism in sentence structure is the juxtaposition of syn-
tactically similar components.
Dominance: A dominance term describes a stylistic effect created by the particular
hierarchical structure of a sentence.
In a simple sentence, for example, there is an effect of simplicity associated
with the single and therefore, by default, dominant clause.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.575123">
Position: A position term describes a stylistic effect created by the particular place-
ment of a syntactic component within a sentence.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.904739875">
For example, in English, a postmodifying adjective, as in the house ablaze, can
be more emphatic than the more usual premodifying type, as in the blazing
house.
Now we shall propose a set of stylistic terms, correlated with this classification,
that will make explicit those abstract stylistic properties that are now only implicit
in existing terminology. These stylistic terms will be based on effects of concord and
discord, which we formally define as follows:
Concord: A stylistic construction that conforms to the norm for a given genre.

<bodyText confidence="0.797629333333333">
Discord: A stylistic construction that deviates from the norm.
We will now use these notions to define abstract elements that are related, in turn, to
effects of balance, dominance, and position.

3.3.1 Balance Elements. The first group of abstract elements is related to effects of
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997006387096774">
balance within a sentence. Here, we will be looking at relationships that tend to either
perturb or reinforce the balance of a sentence. The first and simplest type of balance
element is a homopoise (&amp;quot;same weight&amp;quot;):
Homopoise: A sentence with interclausal coordination of syntactically similar
components.
In other words, there are one or more stylistic &apos;shapes&apos; in a hornopoisal sentence, each
contributing the same type of effect to the concordant parallelism of the sentence. In
the example below, two very simple clauses, with identically shaped parse trees, are
conjoined:
13. The style was formed and the principles were acquired.&apos;
Sentences that are more complex can have their balance interrupted or perturbed
by a heteropoisal (&amp;quot;different weight&amp;quot;) component:
Heteropoise: A sentence in which one or more parenthetical components are syn-
tactically &apos;detached&apos; and dissimilar from the other components at the same
level in the parse tree.
It is difficult to formally characterize this class of structures and the underlying notion
of a component being &apos;detached.&apos; Quirk et al. (1985) also rely on this word to define
what they call disjuncts but make no attempt to define it:
Disjuncts ... have a superior role as compared with the sentence el-
ements; they are syntactically more detached and in some respects
&apos;superordinate,&apos; in that they seem to have a scope that extends over
the sentence as a whole. (Quirk et al. 1985, p. 613)i°
Similarly, Nunberg (1990), in defining the related idea of the delimiter comma, can do
no better than to characterize the class &amp;quot;in a rough way&amp;quot;:
There is the class of elements delimited by commas, either at both ends
(when the elements occur clause-internally) or at one end (roughly,
when the elements are either clause-initial or -final) IF). 361.... It is
obviously not possible here to provide an analysis of the syntax and
semantics of each of these constructions, much less to try to charac-
terize them in such a way as to say what they have in common. In
a rough way, however, we observe that they all involve constituency

10 An example of a disjunct is the interrupting prepositional phrase in all frankness in the sentence Your son
is not, in all frankness, succeeding in his present job (Quirk et al. 1985, p. 612).

problems, so that they do not behave as constituents, for example,
under such tests as verb-phrase ellipsis. What is more, all of them
can be characterized as supplying material that is communicatively
supererogatory to the bare propositional content of the lexical clause
in which they appear. .. . This is all very rough, but it does suggest
that the content of these comma-delimited elements plays a distinctive
role in the representation of the [rhetorical] argument structure of the
text. [pp. 38-391
Despite the difficulty of formal characterization, we agree with Quirk et al. and
Nunberg that there is an intuitively clear class of constructions here, and, like these
authors, hope that it can be conveyed to the reader by sufficient use of examples.
We divide the class of heteropoise sentences into three types, depending upon the
position of the parenthetical component: a heteropoise may be medial, initial, or final.
Moreover, we will distinguish between two subtypes at each position: concordant and
discordant.
Medial heteropoise: A heteropoise in which the parenthetical component is in
medial position.
Concordant medial heteropoise: A medial heteropoise in which the
parenthetical component is cohesively linked to the rest of the sen-
tence. (This notion will be made precise when we have introduced
the primitive elements in Section 3.4.)
Discordant medial heteropoise: A medial heteropoise in which the
parenthetical component is not cohesively linked to the rest of the
sentence.
In example 14 below, the relative clause which brought no protests interrupts the main
clause, yet, as a postmodifier, it is still a part of the subject noun phrase and so the
sentence is a concordant medial heteropoise. But now consider the medial adverbial phrase
according to a company spokesman; as a sentence modifier, it is quite detached from the
rest of the sentence and so the sentence is simultaneously a discordant medial heteropoise:
14. The measure, which brought no protests, was decided, according to a
company spokesman, because of the dangers to which these employees
are exposed in travelling to particularly exposed subtropical countries.&apos;
Initial heteropoise: A heteropoise, concordant or discordant, in which the paren-
thetical component is in initial position.
Sentence 15 contains an initial parenthesis, an appositive noun phrase, that is cohe-
sively linked to the rest of the sentence because it refers to the subject of the main
clause. Thus, the sentence is a concordant initial heteropoise:
15. The heir to a fortune, her friend did not care about passing
examinations.&amp;quot;

<bodyText confidence="0.890315">
Final heteropoise: A heteropoise, concordant or discordant, in which the paren-
thetical component is in final position.
Sentence 16 contains a final parenthesis, an &apos;extraneous&apos; phrase, that is distinct from
the main clause, as it is not cohesively linked to the rest of the sentence. Thus, the
sentence is a discordant final heteropoise:

<listItem confidence="0.580995">
16. Stephen and Jennifer are not going to buy the house, according to a
spokesman.

<bodyText confidence="0.998633">
We saw in 14 that a heteropoise can contain more than one parenthetical, and one
of them might be concordant while another is discordant. Likewise, it can be the case
that one parenthetical is, say, medial, while another is initial or final. The following
example shows two successive medial parentheticals rather stridently interrupting the
main text—the effect is heightened by the use of dashes—as well as a final parenthetical
in the same sentence:
17. The idea of combined French and British patrols by nuclear
submarines—a proposal once made by the Social Democrat
leader David Owen—let alone the plan for &amp;quot;sharing the work&amp;quot;
where the targets and missiles carried by these submarines are
concerned was not even raised, according to a French military
spokesman.13

3.3.2 Dominance Elements. The second type of abstract element deals with stylis-

tic dominance, which is concerned with the hierarchical structure of a sentence. A
common type of dominance element is the monoschema tic, a very simple sentence:
Monoschematic: A sentence with a single main clause with simple phrasal sub-
ordination and no accompanying subordinate or coordinate clauses.
Here is an example of a canonical monoschematic sentence:
18. Posterity has not been kind to him.&apos;
The most common dominance element in the texts that we have studied is the
centroschematic:
Centroschematic: A sentence with a central, dominant clause with one or more
of the following optional features: complex phrasal subordination, initial
dependent clauses, final dependent clauses.
Centroschematic sentences can be quite varied in structure, but their shared charac-
teristic is a predominant component that serves as the organizational center for all
other components. Such structures are built with subordination and coordination. In

the first example below, the main clause is supported by a complex, but subordinate
and coordinate, relative clause structure:
19. Neither these devices nor the cramped viewing rooms which are too
narrow and whose ceilings are much too low for the big altarpieces
manage to spoil the works.&apos;
Two subordinate clauses, the first of them adverbial and the second of them relative,
accompany but do not dominate the main clause in the following sentence:
20. Not all that long ago, the famous collector Charles de Bestegui,
when unable to get hold of certain paintings, was quite prepared to
adorn the walls of his Venetian palace with copies, which happily
rubbed shoulders with his numerous genuine canvases.16
Finally, the complex but imitative postmodification in the next example incorporates
a substantial amount of information without weakening the dominance of the main
clause:
21. Silvia, a commanding woman in her 50&apos;s, a shrew falsely mellowed by
religion, promptly organised prayer sessions on the lines of Tupperware
meetings.&amp;quot;
Given that we have a progression in complexity from monoschematic to cen-
troschematic sentences, a natural extension is to the polyschematic:
Polyschematic: A sentence with more than one central dominant clause and at
least one dependent clause.
Such sentences occur much less frequently than the monoschematic or centroschematic
varieties, at least in the corpus used in this research. However, a sentence with obvi-
ously disparate components occasionally occurs, as in the following example. There are
two dominant clauses (we could think . . . and we should not forget . . .) and a dependent
clause (if we consider the progress . .
22. If we consider the progress already achieved, the opposition that had to
be overcome, for example, in order to open schools for girls, and the fact
that Saudi Arabia is less than 60 years old, we could think that time will
permit resolving the contradictions between the most liberal aspirations
of one part of society and the ulemas&apos; determination to keep the country
as it is, and we should not forget to mention the Islamic fundamentalist
movements which are threatening Saudi Arabia.18

3.3.3 Position Elements. The third group of abstract elements that we will look at are

the position elements. The most common types of position element describe concordant
or discordant stylistic effects in particular positions. Thus, we have initial concord, medial
concord, and final concord. Similarly, we have a range of discord elements. The definitions
of these elements are closely tied to the primitive-level descriptions of our vocabulary,
so we will delay their precise characterizations until Section 3.5, after the primitive-
level descriptions are introduced. Here, it will be sufficient for the reader to know
only that the concords describe constructions, at a particular position in the sentence,
that conform to normal usage while the discords describe constructions that deviate
from the norm.
In addition to effects created by a single concord or discord in a particular po-
sition within the sentence, we can observe other kinds of effects pertaining to the
relationships between concords and discords:
Resolution: A shift in stylistic effect that occurs at the end of a sentence and is a
move from a relative discord to a stylistic concord.
We can see an example of a resolution in 23 below. There is an initial discord, created
by the unusual placement of the adverb entirely, which is not normally found in the
initial position and is not cohesively linked to the rest of the sentence (cf. Section 3.4.3
below). However, there is a final concord, as the subsequent main clause contains no
such incongruities:
23. Entirely in the spirit of protective support, could we suggest you pass on
an appropriate comment to the personnel concerned.&apos;
And the complementary effect is dissolution:
Dissolution: A shift in stylistic effect that occurs at the end of a sentence and is
a move from a relative concord to a stylistic discord.
We have already seen an example of a dissolution in one of the Biblical texts of
Section 1.1, repeated below as 24. A strong initial concord, created by imitative clauses,
is set against a final discord, produced by an uncommon syntactic inversion:
24. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.&apos;

of stylistics, we observed that two analyses of stylistic structure are possible: connective
and hierarchic orderings:
Connective ordering: The result of cohesive bonds drawing together components
in a linear ordering.
Hierarchic ordering: The result of bonds of subordination and superordination
drawing together components in a nested ordering.
These two complementary kinds of analysis are implicit in the work of most stylists
and rhetoricians, such as Cluett (1976) and Bureau (1976) (Neil Randall, personal com-
munication).
We will now use these notions of connective and hierarchic orderings to guide the
definition of more-primitive stylistic elements that provide a precise syntactic basis to
the vocabulary, yet also allow a mapping to the abstract elements.

of Style. We believe that to establish stylistic classifications and construct a practical
stylistic grammar, one must undertake corpus studies in the style of Cluett (1976) and
Biber (1988, 1989) to support the exact classifications of stylistic effects. But we also
agree with Crystal and Davy that:
It is perhaps worth emphasising right away that the first step in any
stylistic analysis must be an intuitive one. The stylistician is on pre-
cisely the same footing as anyone else here: he notices a linguistic
feature which he feels to be stylistically significant. The difference be-
tween his approach and that of the untrained observer is that he will
have a clearer idea of what is likely to be significant, and will know
what to do with his observations once they are made. This last point
is the stylistician&apos;s main competence: he is able to interrelate his obser-
vations within the framework of some theory, and thus piece together
any general pattern of linguistic variation which may exist. (Crystal
and Davy 1969, p. 12)
Thus, although we have built our grammar of style upon accepted theory, it is currently
a prototype for the formal representation of stylistic knowledge, not yet developed as
a tool for practical stylistic analysis.21 For, like Crystal and Davy, our initial objective
is to provide a methodology, a vocabulary and apparatus, that will allow others to
integrate our approach with analytic procedures to construct useful formalizations of
style:
All we can do is systematically point to certain significant facts in the
language being analysed, suggest some theoretical principles which
will account for the occurrence of these facts, emphasise the need for
further analysis to validate or refute these preliminary soundings, and
illustrate a procedure which will allow people to do this. (Crystal and
Davy 1969, p. 13)

In the manner of Crystal and Davy, we agree that statistical verification must
follow such research, but we believe that, initially, we can use well-motivated intuitions
about stylistic frequencies to classify our stylistic elements:
Such a [statistical] method would be prerequisite for any serious re-
search work, but it is too detailed for our present purposes. Conse-
quently we make use of the alternative method of expression, making
our statements of frequency in more informal terms, using such quan-
tifiers as &apos;rarely&apos;, &apos;commonly&apos;, &apos;often&apos;, &apos;very often&apos;, and so on. This
range of adverbials in English cuts up a continuum of frequency very
clearly, with very little overlap, and is readily intelligible. It should
not be forgotten, however, that any statements of relative frequency
in these terms can be referred if necessary to the precise statistical
situation which underlies them. (Crystal and Davy 1969, p. 22)
3.4.3 Primitive Stylistic Elements. Primitive stylistic elements are individual con-
stituents that have a particular stylistic effect. But what should we use as the basis
for the definition of &apos;stylistic effect&apos;? We have said that the two analyses of sentence
structure, connective and hierarchic, can provide the appropriate guidance. We will
define the stylistic effect of an individual component in terms of its contribution to
each ordering:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997492">
• For the connective view, a component acquires its stylistic effect from its
degree of cohesiveness, its bonding with other components in the sentence.
• For the hierarchic view, a component acquires its stylistic effect from its
degree of subordination, its dependence on other components in the
sentence.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9908463">
We introduce the terms conjunct, antijunct, subjunct, and superjunct (to be defined in
the following sections) and we use superscripts on all the terms to indicate the degree
of connectivity or subordination. In the connective view, we classify syntactic com-
ponents as either conjunct4 (excessively connective), conjunct3 (strongly connective),
conjunct2 (moderately connective), conjunctl (mildly connective), and conjunct° (neu-
tral). Similarly, we use the terms antijunct° through antijunct4 to indicate increasingly
disconnective effects; conjunct° and antijunct° are the same.
There is a complementary vocabulary of primitive elements for the hierarchic view.
The stylistic effects of syntactic components are correlated with the degree of subordi-
nation or superordination; the classifications are analogous to the connective: subjunct4
through subjunct° (decreasingly subordinate) and superjunct° through superjunct4 (in-
creasingly superordinate); subjunct° and superjunct° are the same.
Connective primitive elements. In assigning connective effects to syntactic compo-
nents, we adapt Halliday and Hasan&apos;s (1976) work on cohesion. Although Halliday
and Hasan focused on definitions of cohesion in whole texts, we can apply these
definitions to cohesion within the sentence, for, as they point out:
Since cohesive relations are not concerned with structure, they may
be found just as well within a sentence as between sentences. They
attract less notice within a sentence, because of the cohesive strength
of grammatical structure; since the sentence hangs together already,

the cohesion is not needed in order to make it hang together. But the
cohesive relations are there all the same. (Halliday and Hasan 1976,
p.8)
Halliday and Hasan enumerate five types of cohesion: substitution, ellipsis, reference,
conjunction, and lexical cohesion. We will use all of these except lexical cohesion and
will add a new factor, interpolation, that works against cohesion.
Halliday and Hasan define substitution as the &amp;quot;replacement&amp;quot; (p. 88) of one item
by another. We suggest that such intrasentence phenomena as apposition and extra-
position can be considered as types of substitution. For example, in 25, either of the
two postmodifying noun phrases could substitute for the head noun Silvia:
25. Silvia, a commanding woman in her 50s, a shrew falsely mellowed by
religion, promptly organized prayer sessions on the lines of Tupperware
meetings.&apos;
And, in 26, the clausal subject for anyone to escape could substitute for the anticipatory
pronoun it:
26. It was considered impossible for anyone to escape.&apos;
Ellipsis is defined as the omission of an item. Many forms of ellipsis are possible
within the sentence, including the omission of elements of clause structure. In the
following sentence, the ellipsis is marked by &amp;quot; &amp;quot;:
27. I&apos;ll gladly pay for the hotel, if you will for the food.&apos;
Items that have the cohesive property of reference are not interpreted semantically
in their own right, but make reference to something else for their interpretation (Halli-
day and Hasan 1976, p. 31). In English, such items are personal pronouns, demonstra-
tives, and comparatives. These &apos;directive&apos; elements presuppose the existence of some
other element from which information is to be retrieved; whether or not the other
element is within the same sentence, the referential item will be cohesive.
Conjunctive elements are defined as:
elements [that] are not cohesive in themselves but indirectly, by virtue
of their specific meanings; they are not primarily devices for reaching
out into the preceding (or following) text, but they express certain
meanings which presuppose the presence of other components in the
discourse. (Halliday and Hasan 1976, p. 226)
Halliday and Hasan cite the conjunction and, certain adverbs, and certain prepositional
expressions as instances of conjunction. Many of these elements can promote cohesion
within the sentence.
To the principles of cohesion described above, we will add interpolation, a discon-
nective relation that works against cohesion. Interpolated elements are certain instances

The cohesive relations described above can be ranked from the most to the least
cohesive. Halliday and Hasan (pp. 226-227) consider substitution, including ellipsis,
to be the most strictly cohesive relation, followed by reference, and then conjunction.
We adopt this ranking, and so we classify intrasentential substitution and ellipsis
as strongly connective (conjunct3), reference as moderately connective (conjunct2), and
conjunction as mildly connective (conjunct1). We classify interpolation as disconnective
(antijunct2).28
As an illustration of our method of classification of connective primitive elements,
we will use the following sentences, in which the underlined components exhibit dis-
tinct stylistic effects. In the first sentence, the postmodifying construction is a strongly
connective, conjunct3 reduced relative clause, as it is an instance of ellipsis for which
the presupposed items are who is. The postmodifying relative clause in 32 is a moder-
ately connective, conjunct2 referential element, as the relative pronoun &apos;points&apos; to the
preceding noun phrase the man. Lastly, the postposed adjectival in 33 is a disconnec-
tive, antijunct instance of interpolation, as it is detached from the rest of the sentence
and has none of the cohesive properties. (The property of ellipsis is not present, as a
postposed adjective, unlike a reduced relative clause, does not have the same element
of presupposition of specific missing items.):

Halliday distinguishes two types of subordination: embedding (or rank-shifting) and
hypotaxis. These phenomena will be used to classify the hierarchic primitive elements
in our stylistic grammar. Embedding is described as:
the &apos;rank shift&apos; by which a clause or phrase comes to function within
the structure of a group, like who came to dinner in the man who came to
dinner. (Halliday 1985, P. 219)
There are various types of embeddings, including prepositional phrases, as in John
might arrive as early as tomorrow, but Halliday focuses on those within the nominal
group:
[The embedded prepositional phrase] is the only instance of embed-
ding other than in a nominal group. All other embedding in English
is a form of nominalization, where a group, phrase, or clause comes
to function as part of, or in place of (i.e., as the whole of), a nominal
group. (Halliday 1985, p. 187)
Examples of embedded subordination are finite and nonfinite clauses&apos; that function
as postmodifiers, as in the house that Jack built, or as the head of a nominal group, as in
For Jack to build a house would be the best thing (Halliday 1985, p. 220).
Halliday defines hypotaxis as:
the binding of elements of unequal status. The dominant element is
free, but the dependent element is not. [p. 198] In a hypotactic structure
the elements are ordered in dependence, and this ordering is largely
independent of the sequence. [p. 199]
There are many types of hypotaxis, at the clause, phrase, and word levels. Examples
of hypotactic subordination include a dependent clause following a dominant clause,
preceding the dominant, enclosed in the dominant, or enclosing the dominant:

<bodyText confidence="0.99173625">
It should be emphasized that the two types of subordination are quite different:
It is important to distinguish between embedding on the one hand and
hypotaxis on the other. Whereas hypotaxis [is a relation] BETWEEN
clauses (or other ranking elements), embedding is not. Embedding is

a mechanism whereby a clause or phrase comes to function as a con-
stituent WITHIN the structure of a group, which itself is a constituent
of a clause. (Halliday 1985, p. 219)
Consequently, the stylistic effects of embedding and hypotaxis will be subtly different.
Because an embedded structure is a constituent of the dominant structure, we will clas-
sify embeddings as strongly subordinate, subjunct3 . On the other hand, in hypotaxis,
one component is dependent on another, but &amp;quot;in no sense is it a constituent part of
it&amp;quot; (Halliday 1985, p. 219), so we will classify hypotactic structures as only mildly
subordinate, subjunctl
To the factors of embedding and hypotaxis, we add another factor, superordination,
that accounts for structures that are somehow &apos;superior&apos; to the main clause.&amp;quot; That such
phenomena exist is supported by Quirk et al.&apos;s (1985) definition of disjunct, which we
repeat here from Section 3.3.1:
Disjuncts ... have a superior role as compared with the sentence el-
ements; they are syntactically more detached and in some respects
&apos;superordinate,&apos; in that they seem to have a scope that extends over
the sentence as a whole. (Quirk et al. 1985, p. 613)
Disjuncts can be divided into two main classes, style disjuncts and content disjuncts:
Style disjuncts convey the speaker&apos;s comment on the style and form
of what he is saying, defining in some way under what conditions
he is speaking as the &apos;authority&apos; for the utterance. Content disjuncts
(also known as attitudinal disjuncts) make observations on the actual
content of the utterance and its truth conditions. (Quirk et al. 1985,
p. 615)
Examples of these superordinate elements are underlined in the following sen-
tences (the first three contain style disjuncts, the fourth, a content disjunct):

In our grammar, we classify these types of superordinate elements as superjunct.

we will use the following sentences, which display distinct stylistic effects due to the

3.5 Concords and Discords
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955315789474">
In Section 3.3.3, we gave an informal description of the abstract elements of concord
and discord. As these elements are closely tied to the primitive-level descriptions of
our vocabulary, we delayed their precise characterizations until after the primitive
elements of style were introduced. Now, we can define the nature of concords and
discords for both the connective and hierarchic views. In both views, the concords
represent constructions, at a particular position in the sentence, that conform to normal
usage, while the discords describe constructions that deviate from the norm.
In the connective view, the concords are associated with constructions that are
connective, for we assume that cohesion is the default usage, while the discords are
disconnective structures, as a lack of cohesion is less usual. Thus, a concord, which
may be initial, medial, or final, is produced by a conjunct construction; a discord, which
may also appear in any of the three positions, is caused by an antijunct construction.
For the hierarchic view, concords are associated with structures that display a
&apos;normal&apos; degree of subordination or superordination, while discords are produced
by excessive subordination or excessive superordination. Excessive subordination and
superordination are difficult to characterize, but, as a first attempt, we propose that
nesting of dependent structures to a depth greater than three will be considered dis-
cordant subordination and that &apos;detachment&apos; of superordinate structures by &apos;intrusive&apos;
punctuation (e.g., long dashes) will be considered discordant superordination.

we use a single vocabulary of abstract elements, stylistic terms that are maximally
expressive. Rules relate these abstract elements to patterns of lexical, syntactic, and
semantic primitive elements. This level is the unifying core of the grammar; as we
will note later, the same abstract elements can describe both English and French style,
and both syntactic and semantic aspects of style. Finally, at the top level, rules correlate
individual stylistic goals with patterns of abstract elements. Together, these levels form

work has already been done on the development of the lexical and semantic branches

the development of the syntactic component of the stylistic grammar, beginning with
the most detailed and most closely syntactic level, the grammar of primitive elements.
As we proposed earlier, we will consider two analyses of sentence structure, connective
and hierarchic, each with its own stylistic classifications. In this base-level grammar of

primitive elements, the rules are based on syntactic and stylistic rules of Crystal and
Davy (1969), Kane (1983), and Quirk et al. (1985).
In the full grammars given by DiMarco (1990) and subsequently by Hoyt (1993),
each syntactic category is given both a connective and a hierarchic primitive classifi-
cation by corresponding rules. Here, we will present only selected rules, mainly those
associated with the stylistic effects of various types of premodification and postmodifi-
cation in the nominal group. We will begin with the elementary components and work
up to full sentences. In the presentation of the grammar rules, we will first give the
connective rules, then their hierarchic counterparts. Often, we will annotate rules with
relevant examples. (Explanatory notes on the terminology are given in Appendix A.)
Adjectivals. Adjectivals and adverbials are the simplest classes of primitive elements.
To demonstrate that even the smallest syntactic components have individual stylistic
effects, we give selections from the rules for the adjectivals.
Connective view. Adjectivals can be classified within a range of connectivity. In
the moderately connective case, there are a number of alternatives, two of which are
shown below. The first alternative, the genitive form, is a referential element, as it
presupposes the existence of the noun to which it refers. Whether or not this noun is
in the same sentence, a referential personal pronoun is cohesive and so it is classified
as a conjunct2 element. The second alternative, a demonstrative determiner, is also
classified as moderately connective because it too is a referential element.

The less-conjunct case has only one alternative, an adjective. An adjective is usually
used as a premodifier of a noun, so that it presupposes the presence of the noun.

it is classified as conjunctl

Hierarchic view. Adjectivals are generally hypotactic rather than embedded ele-
ments. That is, they are linked to an element (the noun) of different status that could
stand as an independent whole, whereas the adjectival could not. Therefore, we will
classify most adjectivals as subjunctl , mildly subordinating. However, nominal adjec-
tives, which have been rank-shifted, are instances of embedding and so are subjunct3 ,
more strongly subordinating.

The following stylistic variations of noun phrases are defined in the obvious way,
according to the corresponding types of their premodification and postmodification:
monoschematic noun phrase
centroschematic noun phrase
heteropoisal noun phrase
concordant noun phrase
discordant noun phrase
A question that arises at this point is the projection problem; that is, the problem of
how the stylistic effect of a sentence, or even a sentence component, is modified by the
stylistic characteristics of the components nested within it. Our solution is to assume
that if a component is concordant then all its components, to all levels of nesting, must
be concordant, but if a component is discordant then at least one of its components,
at some level of nesting, must have been discordant. Thus, if we have a noun phrase
consisting of concordant premodification, a noun, and discordant postmodification,
the whole noun phrase will be classified as discordant.
We realize this is a very simplified solution, but we believe it will be acceptable in
our work, for our sample corpus, although drawn from high-quality magazine writing,
has few examples of nesting to more than one or two levels.
Verb phrases. The basic verb phrase is defined as follows:

these structures is the major, a single main clause; the next is the complete, which adds
dependent clauses to the main clause. In some rules, we introduce specializations

As well as observing localized effects of concord and discord, we can recognize
more-global shifts from concord to discord, or discord to concord. That is, a specific
part of the sentence seems incongruous, discordant, but this discord is interpreted
within the context of the rest of the sentence, so that it may either be &apos;resolved&apos; by a
return to a usual form, or left unresolved. We have formalized these two situations
in the abstract elements of resolution and dissolution. A resolution is a shift in stylistic
effect that occurs at the end of a sentence and is a move from a relative discord to a
concord. A dissolution is a shift in stylistic effect that occurs at the end of a sentence
and is a move from a relative concord to a discord.

4.4 Grammar of Stylistic Goals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972333333333">
Having completed the central level in the stylistic grammar, the grammar of abstract
elements, we can now define the rules at the top level that correlate patterns of the
abstract elements with the writer&apos;s specific goals.
Stylistic goals, such as clarity, are elusive qualities that up to now have been
defined by stylists by means of examples and informal rules. However, with the vo-
cabulary and formal grammar that we have defined, we now have a way of seeing and
abstracting what these examples have in common. We can abstract from a plethora
of low-level syntactic rules that stylists traditionally have used, and can now define
formal rules for specific stylistic goals.
Note that stylistic goals can be organized along orthogonal dimensions. For ex-
ample, a writer might try to be clear, or obscure, or make no effort either way. Clarity
and obscurity are thus opposite ends of a stylistic dimension. Likewise, the goals of
concreteness and abstraction form a dimension, and so do staticness and dynamism. Be-
low, we look at one end of each of these dimensions; for details of their duals, see
DiMarco (1990) and Hoyt (1993).
Clarity. Clarity is a very pervasive stylistic goal. Almost all the advice in textbooks
of style and rhetoric is aimed at teaching the writer how to achieve clarity. Clarity,
in other words, is thought to be the norm that a writer should strive for. To be clear
is to be plain, precise, and predictable. In keeping with stylistic theory, therefore, we
interpret the goal of clarity as adherence to the stylistic norm and incorporate accepted
definitions of norm, that is, cohesive and concordant structures, in our grammar rule
for clarity.
Thus, we can use our stylistic grammar to give precise definitions to the kinds of
sentences that Kane (1983), for example, associates with clarity:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999623625">
• Simple sentences, which consist of one independent clause: these are our
monoschema tic sentences.
• Centered sentences, which consist of dependent constructions, followed
by a main clause, followed by additional dependent clauses. We expand
the notion of &apos;centered sentence&apos; to include any sentence in which there
is a dominant, concordant core: these are our centroschematic sentences.
• Parallel sentences, which reduce ambiguity by stressing the same
grammatical form: these are our homopoisal sentences.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9196685">

<bodyText confidence="0.994198">
Concreteness. Kane (1983) associates concreteness with sentences that suggest an effect
of immediacy, in which the writer has arranged elements to reflect the natural order
of events or ideas, so that syntax mirrors events. In the terms of our grammar, con-
creteness is associated with sentences that emphasize a particular component, which
may be highlighted either because it is discordant or because it is parenthetical, as in a
hetero poise.

elaborate but strictly balanced structures, the homopoisal sentences.

5. STYLISTIQUE: A Syntactic Stylistic Parser
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997921">
So far, we have developed a vocabulary and methodology for constructing a stylistic
grammar and we have shown how these tools have been applied to the construction
of an English syntactic stylistic grammar. In DiMarco (1990), we applied the same vo-
cabulary and methodology to develop a French syntactic stylistic grammar. However,
these grammars provide only a theoretical foundation for a computational theory of
stylistics. Now we describe the implementation of the stylistic grammars in a com-
putational system. In this section, we will describe the organization of STYLISTIQUE, a
syntactic stylistic parser that interprets the stylistic grammar. We will present a short
example to illustrate STYLISTIQUE&apos;s method of analysis.

over 9,000 lines of QUINTUS PROLOG code. Each stylistic parser consists of the following
three major modules:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998641611111111">
• Lexicon: In addition to conventional information, the lexical entries are
augmented by annotations indicating the connective and hierarchic
primitive stylistic classifications associated with each word. Figure 2
shows several sample lexical entries.
• Syntactic analysis: The parser performs a conventional syntactic analysis,
building a parse tree that identifies the grammatical structure of a
sentence.&amp;quot;
• Stylistic analysis: The stylistic analysis proceeds in tandem with the
syntactic parse. The primitive-element analysis assigns connective and
hierarchic classifications to each sentence component as it is added to the
parse tree. The abstract-element analysis builds higher-level patterns from
these connective and hierarchic primitive elements. The stylistic-goal
analysis correlates these patterns of abstract elements with the author&apos;s
possible stylistic goals. It chooses one goal from each of the following
three dimensions:
- Clarity / neutrality/ obscurity;
- Concreteness! neutrality / abstraction;
- Staticness / neutrality/ dynamism.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983368444444444">
The translation from the grammar rules that were shown in Section 4 to the im-
plementation was straightforward. In most cases, there was an easy way of mapping
between the theoretical rules and the PROLOG rules. For example, heteropoisal postmodifi-
cation is described in the grammar as postmodification that is parenthetical and either
conjunct or antijunct, such as a nominal group or a nonfinite clause. The grammar
rules and corresponding PROLOG rule for one alternative in the definition of postmod-
ification that is both heteropoisal and concordant is shown in Figure 3.48
Although STYLISTIQUE can usually run unaided, it does require punctuation in the
input sentences to assist in disambiguation during parsing. The underlying stylistic
grammar is highly complex, and so, lacking the aid of semantics, the stylistic parser
can produce a number of syntactically grammatical, but not necessarily stylistically
correct, parses for a given sentence. The standard PROLOG cut might have constrained
backtracking and reduced the number of correct parses, but it seemed too crude and
unpredictable to be easily applied to so complex and interdependent a system of rules
47 The English parser is based on a conventional parser written by Kern Luther and Rick MacLean at the
University of Toronto, with supplementary rules suggested by Crystal and Davy (1969) and Quirk
et al. (1985). The French parser is also based on Luther and MacLean&apos;s code, with supplementary rules
adapted from Dubois and Dubois-Charlier (1970) and Galichet (1970).

as STYLISTIQUE. As a simpler solution, we introduced explicit markers of punctuation
that provide a form of partial disambiguation, as they do what the system should have
done unaided but couldn&apos;t, because of the limitations mentioned above. STYLISTIQUE
requires this prior disambiguation mostly for reasons of efficiency. For example, most
parsers are unable to handle the conjunction and by any means other than trying
all possible parses (Snarr 1984). The problem is analogous for or and for the comma
(which can be considered a word). In our parser, the situation is complicated by the
same conjunctions and the same punctuation markers playing different roles according
to their level in the sentence structure. As a consequence, different conjunctions and
punctuation markers are used at the sentence, clause, complement, and noun phrase
level.

initial disjunct, the sentence continues with the bare noun posterity, which, lacking both
premodification and postmodificatioe is a minimal, and therefore concordant, noun
phrase. The sentence ends with the basic verb phrase has been kind, consisting of only
the copula&apos; been, and the concordant, conjunctl adjective kind; this is an inherently
concordant verb phrase.
The sentence is concordant from the hierarchic view as well, for it has the form
of a concordant initial heteropoisal complete sentence. This indicates that the sentence
begins with a parenthetical construction, which in this case is the disjunct, true, a
superordinate adjectival. The bare noun posterity, lacking both premodification and
postmodification, is a monoschematic noun phrase. The verb phrase has been kind is
basic and therefore monoschematic.

<footnote confidence="0.437321666666667">
50 STYLISTIQUE must assign a primitive classification to the postmodification so that this information
can be passed up to the higher levels of the noun phrase. As a consequence, the absence of
postmodification must be marked as (trivially) centroschernatic postmodification, in the connective
view, and (trivially) monoschematic postmodification, in the hierarchic view.
51 The stylistic effects of auxiliary verbs are not taken into account, and so these verb forms are not
recorded in the stylistic parse.

ements are initial and medial concords. The significant dominance elements are cen-
troschematic and monoschematic. That is, this sentence has one dominant shape, which
is, in fact, the whole sentence: it is monoschematic but also trivially centroschematic.
STYLISTIQUE produces the most detailed analysis it can and does not prune extraneous
information. The single important balance element is an initial heteropoise.
In the hierarchic view, STYLISTIQUE finds no significant position elements, but rec-
ognizes one dominance and one balance element: the sentence is centroschematic and
an initial heteropoise. It is the initial disjunct, true, that introduces a superordinate
effect; this feature makes the sentence slightly too complex to be monoschematic.
5.2.3 Stylistic-Goal Analysis. First, we consider the analysis of the sentence on the
clarity/obscurity dimension. The presence of the concords in the connective view,
together with the connective and hierarchic centroschematic structures, gives the sen-
tence an effect of clarity. In a less obvious manner, the presence of an initial disjunct
affects stylistic goals on the other dimensions. Because a superordinate parenthetical
component is present, the sentence is a heteropoise and therefore considered to be con-
crete. On the staticness/dynamism dimension, the sentence has no definite leaning in
either direction.
To summarize, this is a simple clear sentence with the slight incongruity of an
initial parenthesis to relieve its blandness.

5.3 Limitations of the Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983685">
STYLISTIQUE&apos;s limitations arise from the following characteristics of the system:

<listItem confidence="0.9019835">
• The implementation of the grammar is incomplete.
• The grammar is too coarse-grained.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960857142857">
In the first case, the incomplete implementation of the grammar, STYLISTIQUE can
sometimes produce analyses that are inaccurate, though not incorrect, because, due
to time constraints, only about 90% of the full English and French syntactic stylistic
grammars was implemented.
In the second case, the coarse grain of the stylistic grammar reflects theoretical
limitations. The effect of coarse-grainedness was observed in the parses of some of the
sentences in the sample corpus:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984736888888889">
• Some sentences were parsed as simultaneously having both an initial
concord and an initial discord. For example, both the following sentences
were analyzed in this inconsistent manner:
46. To tell everybody is the best thing.
47. Telling lies is wrong.
• Some position elements were incorrectly identified: for example, a final
discord was recorded as an initial discord.
• Some sentences with obviously different degrees of cohesiveness
received the same analysis at the abstract-element level.

stractness of the abstract elements and the resulting coarse grain of the grammar. It
was a deliberate choice to define elements that were quite abstract. A major limitation
of previous work in stylistics was the use of terms that were so specific and so numer-
ous that it was not possible to identify general stylistic features that were common to
sentences that were stylistically similar, but not obviously syntactically similar. How-
ever, our stylistic terms have occasionally erred on the side of being too abstract. For
example, an initial discord in a STYLISTIQUE analysis may correctly identify the presence
of a discord in the sentence but, because the scope of the element can be so broad,
STYLISTIQUE sometimes cannot distinguish between a true initial discord, which occurs
at the start of a sentence, and a noninitial discord that seems to be &apos;initial&apos; because it
affects the whole sentence.
The excessive abstractness of the stylistic elements was further demonstrated by
the rules in Section 4.4, where we used the same patterns of elements to define both
clarity and staticness. That there may be different types of monoschematic sentences,
some merely clear, others static as well, has been overlooked in a stylistic analysis that
relies on maximally expressive descriptions. Our grammar currently does not allow
for such subtleties; although it fulfills our objective of a formalization of style that
captures many generalities, it is not yet sufficiently expressive to distinguish all the
subtleties we would wish.

6.1 Contributions of the Research
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999801833333333">
The problem of style presented advantages as a focus for new research. The codifica-
tion of stylistic knowledge had been a virtually unexplored problem even within the
general research area of computational linguistics. With very few exceptions, previous
work had been unambitious (for example, counting word frequencies, or advocating
basic rules of composition).
Our aim was to create a formal representation of goal-directed, nonliterary stylis-
tics and, moreover, to do so in a manner applicable to different languages. The solution
we proposed was the codification of stylistic knowledge in the form of a stylistic gram-
mar. The construction of a stylistic grammar constitutes a theoretical advance over
previous work in stylistics, for researchers had not attempted to produce a formal
treatment of style, but had relied simply on unstructured normative or descriptive
&apos;rules.&apos; The work we have done toward a grammar of style has brought together ideas
from stylistic theory and knowledge representation and applied them to a hitherto
unformalized body of knowledge.
As a result of building English and French stylistic grammars, we were able to
give more-formal definitions of stylistic goals. Previously, our understanding had been
either purely subjective or based on established but unformalized usage. Now we have
a grammar that correlates stylistic goals with specific patterns of abstract properties of
text. Our contribution to more-formal definitions of stylistic goals was demonstrated
for both syntactic and semantic style, as Ryan (1989, 1992) adapted our vocabulary
and methodology to construct a semantic stylistic grammar that correlated the focus
structure of paragraphs with the abstract elements, and the abstract elements with
specific stylistic goals. In so doing, he augmented the definitions of stylistic goals.
The English and French syntactic stylistic grammars were implemented in STYLIS-

6.2 Applications of the Research
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990159333333333">
6.2.1 Style in Machine Translation. We have developed separate English and French
stylistic grammars and parsers. DiMarco and Hirst (1990) describes the application
of our ideas to machine translation. Given the current French and English stylistic
grammars, the next step in building a system that could preserve style in translation
was to define a mapping between these grammars. Mah (1991, 1992) adapted and
extended our work to add a practical, computational treatment of French—English
comparative stylistics to the theory. This work will eventually make possible machine
translation systems that would be able to preserve or modify style in translation.
Makuta-Giluk (1991; Makuta-Giluk and DiMarco 1993) developed a computational
theory of rhetoric that builds upon our theory to deal with the codification of higher-
level pragmatic effects of language, such as formality, persuasion, and sincerity. Her
work is also applicable to the preservation of stylistic effects in translation.

with stylistic and pragmatic aspects of language is important not only in natural
language understanding, but in generation as well. Our stylistic grammar provides a
formal representation of stylistic knowledge that was previously lacking in generation
systems that attempted to deal with pragmatic issues. BenHassine (1992) adapted
our knowledge representation for stylistics in order to incorporate stylistic constraints
into the Penman language generation system (Penman 1988). Green (1992a, 1992b)
extended and refined our theory of style by adapting work from functional grammar.
Hoyt (1993) and Green have implemented the new theory in an integrated stylistic
analyzer and generator, respectively. DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) are looking at
lexical choice in natural language generation, including considerations of lexical style.
6.2.3 Second-Language Teaching. What has been learned from developing STYLIS-
TIQUE has also been applied to machine-aided language instruction. Existing language-
teaching systems focus almost exclusively on the basics of composition. An instruc-
tional version of STYLISTIQUE could systematically develop a student&apos;s understanding
of the more advanced aspects of language composition. Payette (1990; Payette and
Hirst 1992) developed an instructional system that, applying some of our ideas, ana-
lyzes input sentences for basic normative style and clarity, and offers feedback to the
student.

6.3 Conclusion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966083333333">
Stylistic and pragmatic aspects, though necessary in complete understanding of lan-
guage, have been neglected in computational linguistics research. These problems had
been too vague and ill-defined to be dealt with by computational systems. However,
in this work, we have developed a novel, formal representation of stylistic knowledge
that makes the problem of stylistic analysis more amenable to computational solution.
It is hoped that this research will lead to a system sophisticated enough to deal
with a range of stylistic problems. Long-term applications include the development of a
stylistic post-editor for use in a machine translation system. In addition, the continuing
enhancements of the stylistic analyzer should contribute to a better understanding of
the role style plays in language generation and teaching. The ongoing development
of a formal framework for the representation of knowledge about stylistics should
provide a partial computer model of how people produce style in language.

At all levels of the grammar, the left-hand side of each rule identifies what is being
defined, and the right-hand side lists one or more alternative realizations, one per line.
Sometimes, a particular alternative will be illustrated by an accompanying example.
For instance, the following rule describes the conjunct2 type of adjectival:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.7742116">

conjunct2 adjectival

<bodyText confidence="0.998492">
In this rule, the first alternative realization of a conjunct2 adjectival is a premodifying
genitive, such as the possessive his in his religious works. The second alternative is a
demonstrative determiner, such as this in this substantial selection.
In the grammar, we will use various shorthand notations to simplify the presen-
tation of the rules. However, these abbreviated forms can be expanded into standard
context-free grammar rules. The shorthand notations are as follows; they are illustrated
by particular examples, but are intended for general use:

1. adjectival intensifier adjective
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.964827666666667">
The juxtaposition of terms on the right-hand side of a rule indicates a concatenation
of instances of these terms. For example, the rule above allows the intensifier very to
be followed by the adjective happy to form an adjectival, very happy.
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.9200705">
2. adjectival --&gt; (intensifier) adjective
Parentheses indicate that the form is optional. In this example, an adjectival could be
either an intensifier followed by an adjective or an adjective alone.
3. adjectival —+ (intensifier)+ adjective
The Kleene cross indicates one or more occurrences of the form within parentheses.
4. adjectival (intensifier)* adjective
The Kleene star indicates zero or more occurrences of the form within parentheses.
5. postmodification with parenthesis
Where a rule has several alternatives, this shorthand notation using with abbreviates
a long sequence of alternatives (here, the many types of parenthesis).

<abstract confidence="0.996491545454545">The problem of style is highly relevant to computational linguistics, but current systems deal only superficially, if at all, with subtle but significant nuances of language. Expressive effects, together with their associated meaning, contained in the style of a text are lost to analysis and absent from generation. We have developed an approach to the computational treatment of style that is intended to eventually incorporate three selected components—lexical, syntactic, and semantic. In this paper, we concentrate on certain aspects of syntactic style. We have designed and implemented a computational theory of goal-directed stylistics that can be used in various applications, including machine translation, second-language instruction, and natural language generation. We have constructed a vocabulary of style that contains both primitive and abstract elements of style. The primitive elements describe the stylistic effects of individual sentence components. These elements are combined into patterns that are described by a stylistic meta-language, the abstract elements, that define the concordant and discordant stylistic effects common to a group of sentences. Higher-level patterns are built from the abstract elements and associated with specific stylistic goals, such as clarity or concreteness. Thus, we have defined rules for a syntactic stylistic grammar at three interrelated levels of description: primitive elements, abstract elements, and stylistic goals. Grammars for both English and French have been constructed, using the same vocabulary and the same development methodology. Parsers that implement these grammars have also been built. The stylistic grammars codify aspects of language that were previously defined only descriptively. The theory is being applied to various problems in which the form of an utterance conveys an essential part of meaning and so must be precisely represented and understood.</abstract>

Her work is also applicable to the preservation of stylistic effects in translation. 6.2.2 Natural Language Generation with Stylistic Constraints. The ability to deal with stylistic and pragmatic aspects of language is important not only in natural language understanding, but in generation as well. Our stylistic grammar provides a formal representation of stylistic knowledge that was previously lacking in generation systems that attempted to deal with pragmatic issues.

In the last section, we will review the contributions of the paper and discuss completed and ongoing extensions to the research. 2. Background to the Study of Style 2.1 Views of Style 2.1.1 The Classical View. The study of style has an ancient history, for the concept first appeared in the fifth century B.C. Scholars of the time conceived the notion that the rhetorical form of a writer&apos;s text should reflect his thoughts and intentions. This was to be achieved through the appropriate choice and organization of words and syntactic structures in order to &amp;quot;evoke the desired response&amp;quot; (Corbett 1971). Content and form were recognized as inseparable, and as exerting a reciprocal influence upon each other. Beginning with Corax of Syracuse, rhetoricians developed methods for systematic instruction in the art of writing. The classical scholars, from Isocrates and Aristotle to Cicero and Quintilian, established standards of rhetoric that influenced curricula for centuries. The contribution of Aristotle was particularly notable. He countered Plato&apos;s argument that rhetoric was mere sophistry, deceitful reasoning, by providing a system of instruction that treated the theory and practice of style </context>
<context position="19285" citStr="Corbett 1971" startWordPosition="3086" endWordPosition="3087">ical approach to style flourished into the Middle Ages, for it formed part of a standard university education. The teaching of formal rhetoric in schools and universities continued to play a significant role throughout the Renaissance and into the 18th century. However, in the 19th century, the teaching of rhetoric gave way to the teaching of composition, which came to be associated merely with a set of basic prescriptive rules. This approach was in direct contrast to the original classical theory that stressed the education of the whole person as a preparation for achieving style in writing (Corbett 1971). 2.1.2 The Modern View. Today, the common view of style is still one of conformity to standard good taste and an avoidance of bad form. Textbooks (Fowler 1968; Strunk and White 1979; Kane 1983; Grevisse 1986) promote the idea that there is a universal and correct mode of expression. However, normative rules, while necessary in some degree so that communication is possible at all, may, if too inflexible, deaden the expression of a writer&apos;s individual voice. Universal rules of good style are best used, we suggest, simply as a guide to avoiding bad constructions and obstacles to clear writing, b</context>

But if parallelism or coordination plays an important role in style, so too does subordination: variations in the hierarchical structure of a sentence that can produce correspondingly different stylistic effects. One part of a sentence can dominate another. As with parallelism, the importance to style of syntactic hierarchy is also a well-established principle in classical rhetoric, evident in the schemes of parenthesis, apposition, and climax (Corbett 1971, pp. 466, 468, 476). Thus, modulations in coordinate and subordinate structure are major factors in achieving stylistic express</context>

Their book is still used as a prescribed text in translation courses. Vinay and Darbelnet did not take an explicitly goal-directed approach, but their book does contain a great deal of information about the correlation of stylistic goals with particular lexical, syntactic, and semantic choices. Unfortunately, however, their rules proved to be too languagedependent for the framework that is proposed in this paper. But the success of a goal-directed codification, albeit an implicit one, supports the approach that we will take below. Crystal and Davy (1969) hypothesized the creation of a formal stylistic grammar, built upon a vocabulary of stylistic terms and intended to represent the sentence structures characteristic of a particular stylistic sublanguage. However, the grammar that they sketched contained virtually no terms other than purely syntactic ones and no correlations with stylistic goals; it was only a first step, although an ambitious one, toward a codification of the stylistic rules that define a sublanguage.

We will adapt these factors from theoretical stylistics as the divisions of our vocabulary of style. Now, we will classify commonly used stylistic terms into these three groups in order to identify and abstract the general properties of style characteristic of each group. 3.2.2 Abstract Properties of Style. In the balance group, we classify the terms symmetric construction (Hendricks 1976), serial sentence (Kane 1983), parallel sentence (Kane 1983), balanced sentence (Kane 1983), and intersentence coordination (Crystal and Davy 1969). All of these terms suggest a stylistic imitation, the balancing of syntactically similar clauses. We also find evidence of stylistic parallelism below the clause level in the use of terms such as paired adjectives (Kane 1983), balanced phrases (Crystal and Davy 1969), and intrasentence coordination (Hendricks 1976). As well as identifying similar structures, stylists have recognized characteristic asymmetric constructions (Hendricks 1976) or syntactic counterpoint (Hendricks 1976). These types of structures are most often interrupted or convoluted sentences (Kane 1983). For inclusion in our </context>

The position group appears to contain the largest number of terms, as any basic term can be qualified to an arbitrarily fine degree by the exact intrasentence position to which it refers. We will use only three qualifiers, associated with initial, medial, and final positions (Quirk et al. 1985). At the sentence level, we can have any word or phrase in initial, medial, or final position. Within the sentence, there are almost infinite variations of position terms. A small sample includes postpositive adjectives, and pre-verbal, postverbal, or post-clause adverbs (Crystal and Davy 1969), and complex premodification and postmodification (Crystal and Davy 1969). We will generalize from these many subtle variations and define terms that have either a concordant or discordant effect, at a particular position in a sentence, according to whether or not their usage is normal. From this grouping of terms into the three divisions of balance, dominance, and position, we have abstracted general properties of style that we want to describe in our vocabulary.

This last point is the stylistician&apos;s main competence: he is able to interrelate his observations within the framework of some theory, and thus piece together any general pattern of linguistic variation which may exist. (Crystal and Davy 1969, p. 12) Thus, although we have built our grammar of style upon accepted theory, it is currently a prototype for the formal representation of stylistic knowledge, not yet developed as a tool for practical stylistic analysis.21 For, like Crystal and Davy, our initial objective is to provide a methodology, a vocabulary and apparatus, that will allow others to integrate our approach with analytic procedures to construct useful formalizations of style: All we can do is systematically point to certain significant facts in the language being analysed, suggest some theoretical principles which will a</context>

Consequently we make use of the alternative method of expression, making our statements of frequency in more informal terms, using such quantifiers as &apos;rarely&apos;, &apos;commonly&apos;, &apos;often&apos;, &apos;very often&apos;, and so on. This range of adverbials in English cuts up a continuum of frequency very clearly, with very little overlap, and is readily intelligible. It should not be forgotten, however, that any statements of relative frequency in these terms can be referred if necessary to the precise statistical situation which underlies them.

But what should we use as the basis for the definition of &apos;stylistic effect&apos;? We have said that the two analyses of sentence structure, connective and hierarchic, can provide the appropriate guidance.

Here, we will present only selected rules, mainly those associated with the stylistic effects of various types of premodification and postmodification in the nominal group. We will begin with the elementary components and work up to full sentences.

We have developed separate English and French stylistic grammars and parsers. DiMarco and Hirst (1990) describes the application of our ideas to machine translation. Given the current French and English stylistic grammars, the next step in building a system that could preserve style in translation was to define a mapping between these grammars. Mah (1991, 1992) adapted and extended our work to add a practical, computational treatment of French—English comparative stylistics to the theory. This work will eventually make possible machine translation systems that would be able to preserve or modify style in translation.

All other embedding in English is a form of nominalization, where a group, phrase, or clause comes to function as part of, or in place of (i.e., as the whole of), a nominal group.

Whereas hypotaxis [is a relation] BETWEEN clauses (or other ranking elements), embedding is not. Embedding is 30 If the clause is relative, then it must be defining (restrictive) to be an embedded clause; a non-defining relative clause is an instance of hypotaxis (to be defined below). 31 Halliday 1985, p. 200. 32 Halliday 1985, p. 200. 33 Halliday 1985, p. 200. 34 Halliday 1985, p. 200. 472 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax a mechanism whereby a clause or phrase comes to function as a constituent WITHIN the structure of a group, which itself is a constituent of a clause.

They attract less notice within a sentence, because of the cohesive strength of grammatical structure; since the sentence hangs together already, 469 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 the cohesion is not needed in order to make it hang together. But the cohesive relations are there all the same. (Halliday and Hasan 1976, p.8) Halliday and Hasan enumerate five types of cohesion: substitution, ellipsis, reference, conjunction, and lexical cohesion. We will use all of these except lexical cohesion and will add a new factor, interpolation, that works against cohesion. Halliday and Hasan define substitution as the &amp;quot;replacement&amp;quot; (p. 88) of one item by another. We suggest that such intrasentence phenomena as apposition and extraposition can be considered as types of substitution. For example, in 25, either of the two postmodifying noun phrases could substitute for the head noun Silvia: 25. Silvia, a commanding woma</context>

It was considered impossible for anyone to escape.&apos; Ellipsis is defined as the omission of an item. Many forms of ellipsis are possible within the sentence, including the omission of elements of clause structure. In the following sentence, the ellipsis is marked by &amp;quot; &amp;quot;: 27. I&apos;ll gladly pay for the hotel, if you will for the food.&apos; Items that have the cohesive property of reference are not interpreted semantically in their own right, but make reference to something else for their interpretation (Halliday and Hasan 1976, p. 31). In English, such items are personal pronouns, demonstratives, and comparatives. These &apos;directive&apos; elements presuppose the existence of some other element from which information is to be retrieved; whether or not the other element is within the same sentence, the referential item will be cohesive. Conjunctive elements are defined as: elements [that] are not cohesive in themselves but indirectly, by virtue of their specific meanings; they are not primarily devices for reaching out into the preceding (or following) text, but they express certain meanings which presuppose the presence of</context>

Thus, we can see that three factors influencing syntactic style are: • Balance: Parallelism of structure. • Dominance: Structural hierarchy. • Position: Linear ordering of structure. We will adapt these factors from theoretical stylistics as the divisions of our vocabulary of style. Now, we will classify commonly used stylistic terms into these three groups in order to identify and abstract the general properties of style characteristic of each group. 3.2.2 Abstract Properties of Style. In the balance group, we classify the terms symmetric construction (Hendricks 1976), serial sentence (Kane 1983), parallel sentence (Kane 1983), balanced sentence (Kane 1983), and intersentence coordination (Crystal and Davy 1969). All of these terms suggest a stylistic imitation, the balancing of syntactically similar clauses. We also find evidence of stylistic parallelism below the clause level in the use of terms such as paired adjectives (Kane 1983), balanced phrases (Crystal and Davy 1969), and intrasentence coordination (Hendricks 1976). As well as identifying similar structures, stylists have recognized characteristic asymmetric constructions (Hendricks 1976) or synta</context>

As we proposed earlier, we will consider two analyses of sentence structure, connective and hierarchic, each with its own stylistic classifications. In this base-level grammar of 40 We expect that a particular stylistic grammar will be applicable to a family of stylistically similar languages. 475 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 primitive elements, the rules are based on syntactic and stylistic rules of Crystal and Davy (1969), Kane (1983), and Quirk et al. (1985). In the full grammars given by DiMarco (1990) and subsequently by Hoyt (1993), each syntactic category is given both a connective and a hierarchic primitive classification by corresponding rules. Here, we will present only selected rules, mainly those associated with the stylistic effects of various types of premodification and postmodification in the nominal group. We will begin with the elementary components and work up to full sentences. In the presentation of the grammar rules, we will first give the connective rules, then their hierarchic counterparts. Often, we will annotate rules with relevant examples. (Explanatory notes on the terminology are given in Appendix</context>

Note that stylistic goals can be organized along orthogonal dimensions. For example, a writer might try to be clear, or obscure, or make no effort either way. Clarity and obscurity are thus opposite ends of a stylistic dimension. Likewise, the goals of concreteness and abstraction form a dimension, and so do staticness and dynamism. Below, we look at one end of each of these dimensions; for details of their duals, see DiMarco (1990) and Hoyt (1993). Clarity. Clarity is a very pervasive stylistic goal. Almost all the advice in textbooks of style and rhetoric is aimed at teaching the writer how to achieve clarity. Clarity, in other words, is thought to be the norm that a writer should strive for. To be clear is to be plain, precise, and predictable. In keeping with stylistic theory, therefore, we interpret the goal of clarity as adherence to the stylistic norm and incorporate accepted definitions of norm, that is, cohesive and concordant structures, in our grammar rule for clarity.

Our stylistic grammar provides a formal representation of stylistic knowledge that was previously lacking in generation systems that attempted to deal with pragmatic issues. BenHassine (1992) adapted our knowledge representation for stylistics in order to incorporate stylistic constraints into the Penman language generation system (Penman 1988). Green (1992a, 1992b) extended and refined our theory of style by adapting work from functional grammar. Hoyt (1993) and Green have implemented the new theory in an integrated stylistic analyzer and generator, respectively. DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) are looking at lexical choice in natural language generation, including considerations of lexical style. 6.2.3 Second-Language Teaching.

These programs enforce the basic virtues: be clear, be simple, be precise. They merely check for common grammatical errors such as number disagreement, pronoun case problems, unbalanced punctuation, split infinitives, excessive sentence length, and excessive sentence complexity. There is no systematic approach to constructing a vocabulary of style, no structured representation of stylistic rules. Stylistic knowledge may simply consist, as in the case of CRITIQUE, of an unstructured mass of rules (Jensen et al. 1986, p. 190). These programs have no real understanding of the significance of stylistic parameters. The other main kind of computational research in stylistics has been statistical (e.g., Cluett 1976, 1990; Milic 1982; Biber 1988, 1989). With this approach, a count is made of the number of occurrences in a sample text of a stylistically significant feature, such as an initial prepositional phrase. A statistical analysis is done to compare the count and type of stylistic features with the corresponding parameters of texts written by authors working in the same or different genres.

However, in the 19th century, the teaching of rhetoric gave way to the teaching of composition, which came to be associated merely with a set of basic prescriptive rules. This approach was in direct contrast to the original classical theory that stressed the education of the whole person as a preparation for achieving style in writing (Corbett 1971). 2.1.2 The Modern View. Today, the common view of style is still one of conformity to standard good taste and an avoidance of bad form. Textbooks (Fowler 1968; Strunk and White 1979; Kane 1983; Grevisse 1986) promote the idea that there is a universal and correct mode of expression. However, normative rules, while necessary in some degree so that communication is possible at all, may, if too inflexible, deaden the expression of a writer&apos;s individual voice. Universal rules of good style are best used, we suggest, simply as a guide to avoiding bad constructions and obstacles to clear writing, but not as a basis for a theory of stylistic effects in text. 2.1.3 Our View. In computational applications, where we expect to deal with large amounts of similar types of text, the analysis of </context>

Thus, we can see that three factors influencing syntactic style are: • Balance: Parallelism of structure. • Dominance: Structural hierarchy. • Position: Linear ordering of structure. We will adapt these factors from theoretical stylistics as the divisions of our vocabulary of style. Now, we will classify commonly used stylistic terms into these three groups in order to identify and abstract the general properties of style characteristic of each group. 3.2.2 Abstract Properties of Style. In the balance group, we classify the terms symmetric construction (Hendricks 1976), serial sentence (Kane 1983), parallel sentence (Kane 1983), balanced sentence (Kane 1983), and intersentence coordination (Crystal and Davy 1969). All of these terms suggest a stylistic imitation, the balancing of syntactically similar clauses. We also find evidence of stylistic parallelism below the clause level in the use of terms such as paired adjectives (Kane 1983), balanced phrases (Crystal and Davy 1969), and intrasentence coordination (Hendricks 1976). As well as identifying similar structures, stylists have recognized characteristic asymmetric constructions (Hendricks 1976) or syntactic counterpoint (Hendricks </context>

For inclusion in our vocabulary, we will choose the most representative terms in the balance group: intersentence coordination and intrasentence counterpoint. There are a variety of terms that can be classified into the dominance group. First, there are sentences that have one trivially dominant clause. These are the simple sentences (Kane 1983) that have only one main, or central, clause with no subordinate clauses. Next, there are many and varied types of sentences built up around a central, dominant clause. The complex sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause and at least one dependent clause. The loose sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause followed by 461 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 a subordinate clause. The centered sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause flanked by subordinate clauses. The cumulative sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause accompanied by a series of appositive, modifying, or absolute constructions. Finally, there are more-complicated sentences with more than one dominant clause. The compoundcomplex sentence (Kane 1983) can be much more elaborate than a simple compound sentence, as </context>

We expand the notion of &apos;centered sentence&apos; to include any sentence in which there is a dominant, concordant core: these are our centroschematic sentences. • Parallel sentences, which reduce ambiguity by stressing the same grammatical form: these are our homopoisal sentences.

From this, we derive the notions of stylistic concord and discord as the fundamental principles of our formalization. Concord simply means conformity with the norm, and discord, deviation from the norm. Each genre has its own particular norm; for example, the style characteristic of scientific texts may seem disruptive if used in general newspaper writing. This view goes beyond the tenet of prescriptive rhetoric that the stylistic norm merely represents standard, &apos;good,&apos; style, independent of the use of the text. Rather, we agree with Lanham (1974) that style should be viewed as the tailoring of a text to a specific audience and a specific situation; &apos;good&apos; style can in fact be quite inappropriate. The concept of norm will be useful as a means of anchoring the development of our stylistic rules. It is simply the usual, the typical, the stable and concordant. Indeed, discord, deviation from the norm, will play an essential role in our formalization of style, for it is our contention that style arises from the construction of patterns of 460 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax concord and discord, particular c</context>

This body of rules was &apos;structured&apos; to the extent that there were hierarchies of stylistic sentence types, but, in general, Kane&apos;s rules appear to be just an enumeration of stylistic tenets, not a deliberately constructed organization. Nevertheless, we have found it useful to draw upon these rules as justification for the syntactic coverage of our grammar. In computational stylistics, an application area of particular interest to us is machine translation (MT). In suggesting the applicability of computational stylistics to MT, Loffler-Laurian (1986) emphasized an important point: although corresponding group styles may exist across languages, the realization of the style can be different for each language. Tsutsumi (1990) presented a methodology for bridging stylistic gaps (stylistic differences) between the syntax of the source and target languages in MT. An important contribution of Tsutsumi&apos;s work is the recognition that computational stylistics is useful for the translation of pairs of languages that are not in the same language group.

For inclusion in our vocabulary, we abstract from these three types of hierarchical terms to identify trivial single-clause dominance, complex single-clause dominance, and multiple-clause dominance. The position group appears to contain the largest number of terms, as any basic term can be qualified to an arbitrarily fine degree by the exact intrasentence position to which it refers. We will use only three qualifiers, associated with initial, medial, and final positions (Quirk et al. 1985). At the sentence level, we can have any word or phrase in initial, medial, or final position. Within the sentence, there are almost infinite variations of position terms. A small sample includes postpositive adjectives, and pre-verbal, postverbal, or post-clause adverbs (Crystal and Davy 1969), and complex premodification and postmodification (Crystal and Davy 1969). We will generalize from these many subtle variations and define terms that have either a concordant or discordant effect, at a particular position in a sentence, according to whether or not their usage is normal.

It is difficult to formally characterize this class of structures and the underlying notion of a component being &apos;detached.&apos; Quirk et al.

Now that a set of abstract stylistic elements has been defined, we must next consider how to use them in practical stylistic analysis. So far, these elements are too general to apply to the interpretation of an arbitrary sentence. We must relate these stylistic elements to more-basic syntactic elements, whose stylistic characteristics are more specific and concrete. In our reading of the literature 19 Quirk et al. (1985, p. 652). 20 Matthew 7:27, Revised Standard Version (1952). 467 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 of stylistics, we observed that two analyses of stylistic structure are possible: connective and hierarchic orderings: Connective ordering: The result of cohesive bonds drawing together components in a linear ordering. Hierarchic ordering: The result of bonds of subordination and superordination drawing together components in a nested ordering. These two complementary kinds of analysis are implicit in the work of most stylists and rhetoricians, such as Cluett (1976) and Bureau (1976) </context>

(Halliday and Hasan 1976, p. 226) Halliday and Hasan cite the conjunction and, certain adverbs, and certain prepositional expressions as instances of conjunction. Many of these elements can promote cohesion within the sentence. To the principles of cohesion described above, we will add interpolation, a disconnective relation that works against cohesion.

(Quirk et al. 1985, p. 613) Disjuncts can be divided into two main classes, style disjuncts and content disjuncts: Style disjuncts convey the speaker&apos;s comment on the style and form of what he is saying, defining in some way under what conditions he is speaking as the &apos;authority&apos; for the utterance. Content disjuncts (also known as attitudinal disjuncts) make observations on the actual content of the utterance and its truth conditions.

As a result of building English and French stylistic grammars, we were able to give more-formal definitions of stylistic goals. Previously, our understanding had been either purely subjective or based on established but unformalized usage. Now we have a grammar that correlates stylistic goals with specific patterns of abstract properties of text. Our contribution to more-formal definitions of stylistic goals was demonstrated for both syntactic and semantic style, as Ryan (1989, 1992) adapted our vocabulary and methodology to construct a semantic stylistic grammar that correlated the focus structure of paragraphs with the abstract elements, and the abstract elements with specific stylistic goals. In so doing, he augmented the definitions of stylistic goals.

As a simpler solution, we introduced explicit markers of punctuation that provide a form of partial disambiguation, as they do what the system should have done unaided but couldn&apos;t, because of the limitations mentioned above. STYLISTIQUE requires this prior disambiguation mostly for reasons of efficiency. For example, most parsers are unable to handle the conjunction and by any means other than trying all possible parses (Snarr 1984). The problem is analogous for or and for the comma (which can be considered a word). In our parser, the situation is complicated by the same conjunctions and the same punctuation markers playing different roles according to their level in the sentence structure. As a consequence, different conjunctions and punctuation markers are used at the sentence, clause, complement, and noun phrase level. 5.2 A Sample Stylistic Parse A corpus of 75 sentences (52 English, 23 French) was used to test the parser.

Every text, large or small, interesting or dull, effective or not, has its own style. Nor are we talking about style in any of its normative senses: the common tenets dictating standard forms (e.g., Chicago 1982), or the textbook prescriptions for &apos;good&apos; style: be clear, be simple, be precise (e.g., Strunk and White 1979). For people aim to convince, to persuade, to impress, and, even, sometimes to obscure, and standard textbooks tell us very little about such varied and subtle stylistic and pragmatic goals. Rather than a study of literary or normative style, our intent is to determine what gives any ordinary piece of text its stylistic &apos;feel.&apos; The following examples will demonstrate what we have in mind.

However, in the 19th century, the teaching of rhetoric gave way to the teaching of composition, which came to be associated merely with a set of basic prescriptive rules. This approach was in direct contrast to the original classical theory that stressed the education of the whole person as a preparation for achieving style in writing (Corbett 1971). 2.1.2 The Modern View. Today, the common view of style is still one of conformity to standard good taste and an avoidance of bad form. Textbooks (Fowler 1968; Strunk and White 1979; Kane 1983; Grevisse 1986) promote the idea that there is a universal and correct mode of expression. However, normative rules, while necessary in some degree so that communication is possible at all, may, if too inflexible, deaden the expression of a writer&apos;s individual voice. Universal rules of good style are best used, we suggest, simply as a guide to avoiding bad constructions and obstacles to clear writing, but not as a basis for a theory of stylistic effects in text. 2.1.3 Our View.

Nevertheless, we have found it useful to draw upon these rules as justification for the syntactic coverage of our grammar. In computational stylistics, an application area of particular interest to us is machine translation (MT). In suggesting the applicability of computational stylistics to MT, Loffler-Laurian (1986) emphasized an important point: although corresponding group styles may exist across languages, the realization of the style can be different for each language. Tsutsumi (1990) presented a methodology for bridging stylistic gaps (stylistic differences) between the syntax of the source and target languages in MT. An important contribution of Tsutsumi&apos;s work is the recognition that computational stylistics is useful for the translation of pairs of languages that are not in the same language group. Hovy&apos;s (1988) PAULINE system was the first computational system that implemented goal-directed style. PAULINE was able to generate text that conformed to various stylistic and pragmatic constraints that it was given. The system was goal-directed, able to correlate such styli</context>

However, different languages might realize this effect in different ways. So the source and target texts should both aim for the author&apos;s stylistic goal, but might have to achieve it through different linguistic means.&apos; • Yet one wants to produce a text whose style is appropriate and natural to the particular target language. Languages differ as to the most &apos;natural&apos; way to express an idea. For example, French tends to prefer more abstraction, English more concreteness (Vinay and Darbelnet 1958). The best translation, therefore, might modify the original author&apos;s stylistic intent and express a different effect. Sometimes, there is no way to resolve this dilemma, and one is left with an unsatisfactory translation. But, with a knowledge of the comparative stylistics of a language pair, and of the stylistic resources of each language and the possible range of effects they can create, one can substantially improve the quality of a translation. 1.3 The Structure of the Paper Our goal is to create a formal representation of stylistics for use in natural language systems, and, moreover, to </context>

Similarly, a speaker or writer is accountable for all the stylistic nuances of his or her utterances; it is not possible to utter a sentence in such a way that only the propositional content counts and not the form in which it is expressed. 7 &amp;quot;Economy is expressed at two levels, lexical and syntactic, which may, however, be related: what is expressed lexically in one language may be realized through syntactic means in the other, and vice versa&amp;quot; (Vinay and Darbelnet 1958, p. 185, authors&apos; translation). 455 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 be as general as possible, ideally applicable to the codification of style for the sentence and paragraph levels; appropriate for lexical, syntactic, and semantic style; and applicable to both English and French. The methodology will be used in conjunction with the stylistic vocabulary to guide the systematic collection and creation of stylistic rules. This grammar will provide a formal description of the syntactic patterns that differentiate the various stylistic goals. In addition to theoretical problems, ther</context>

In applications such as machine translation, we want to understand why a writer has used language in a particular way, what specific effects she intended to convey, and which linguistic choices were made to achieve these goals. There are a multitude of goals that could be considered; indeed, the space of possibilities has never been fully explored. For this study, we have chosen six goals that Vinay and Darbelnet (1958) consider to be among the most commonly used, representing the opposite ends of three dimensions. The goals are listed as follows, with an intuitive description of the corresponding characteristics that a sentence of each type would display: • Clarity: Simplicity, harmony, and no ambiguity. Obscurity: Complexity, incongruity, and difficulty of understanding. • Concreteness: Specificity, with an emphasis on certain components. Abstraction: Generality, with no particular emphasis on any one sentence component. • Staticness: Uniformity, predictability, continuity. Dynamism: Deviation from the nor</context>
