Automatically detecting dialogue structure
within corpora of human-human dialogue is
the subject of increasing attention. In the do-
main of tutorial dialogue, automatic discovery
of dialogue structure is of particular interest
because these structures inherently represent
tutorial strategies or modes, the study of
which is key to the design of intelligent tutor-
ing systems that communicate with learners
through natural language. We propose a
methodology in which a corpus of human-
human tutorial dialogue is first manually an-
notated with dialogue acts. Dependent adja-
cency pairs of these acts are then identified
through χ2 analysis, and hidden Markov mod-
eling is applied to the observed sequences to
induce a descriptive model of the dialogue
structure.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999922152173913">
Automatically learning dialogue structure from
corpora is an active area of research driven by a
recognition of the value offered by data-driven ap-
proaches (e.g., Bangalore et al., 2006). Dialogue
structure information is of particular importance
when the interaction is centered around a learning
task, such as in natural language tutoring, because
techniques that support empirical identification of
dialogue strategies can inform not only the design
of intelligent tutoring systems (Forbes-Riley et al.,
2007), but also contribute to our understanding of
the cognitive and affective processes involved in
learning through tutoring (VanLehn et al., 2007).
Although traditional top-down approaches (e.g.,
Cade et al., 2008) and some empirical work on
analyzing the structure of tutorial dialogue
(Forbes-Riley et al., 2007) have yielded significant
results, the field is limited by the lack of an auto-
matic, data-driven approach to identifying dialogue
structure. An empirical approach to identifying
tutorial dialogue strategies, or modes, could ad-
dress this limitation by providing a mechanism for
describing in succinct probabilistic terms the tuto-
rial strategies that actually occur in a corpus.
Just as early work on dialogue act interpretation
utilized hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture
linguistic structure (Stolcke et al., 2000), we pro-
pose a system that uses HMMs to capture the
structure of tutorial dialogue implicit within se-
quences of already-tagged dialogue acts. This ap-
proach operates on the premise that at any given
point in the tutorial dialogue, the collaborative in-
teraction is in a dialogue mode that characterizes
the nature of the exchanges between tutor and stu-
dent. In our model, a dialogue mode is defined by
a probability distribution over the observed sym-
bols (e.g., dialogue acts and adjacency pairs).
Our previous work has noted some limitations
of first-order HMMs as applied to sequences of
individual dialogue acts (Boyer et al., in press).
Chief among these is that HMMs allow arbitrarily
frequent transitions between hidden states, which
does not conform well to human intuition about
how tutoring strategies are applied. Training an
HMM on a sequence of adjacency pairs rather than
individual dialogue acts is one way to generate a

more descriptive model without increasing model
complexity more than is required to accommodate
the expanded set of observation symbols. To this
end, we apply the approach of Midgley et al.
(2006) for empirically identifying significant adja-
cency pairs within dialogue, and proceed by treat-
ing adjacency pairs as atomic units for the
purposes of training the HMM.

This analysis uses a corpus of human-human tuto-
rial dialogue collected in the domain of introduc-
tory computer science. Forty-three learners
interacted remotely with a tutor through a key-
board-to-keyboard remote learning environment
yielding 4,864 dialogue moves.
The tutoring corpus was manually tagged with
dialogue acts designed to capture the salient char-
acteristics of the tutoring process (Table 1).

The correspondence between utterances and dia-

Schlegoff &amp; Sacks, 1973), and adjacency pair
analysis has illuminated important phenomena in
tutoring as well (Forbes-Riley et al., 2007). For
the current corpus, bigram analysis of dialogue acts

The keyboard-to-keyboard tutorial interaction re-

tated with dialogue acts. We have hypothesized
that a higher-level dialogue structure, namely the
tutorial dialogue mode, overlays the observed dia-
logue acts. To build an HMM model of this struc-

and train a hidden Markov model to induce the
dialogue modes and their associated dialogue act
emission probability distributions.
An adjacency pair joining algorithm (Figure 1)
was applied to each sequence of dialogue acts.
This algorithm joins pairs of dialogue acts into
atomic units according to a priority determined by
the strength of the adjacency pair dependency.

The final set of observed symbols consists of 39

It was desirable to learn n, the best number of
hidden states, during modeling rather than specify-
ing this value a priori. To this end, we trained and
ten-fold cross-validated seven models (each featur-

number of hidden states n from 2 to 15, inclusive.2

models (Scott, 2002). The best fit was obtained
with n=4 (Figure 3). The transition probability
distribution among hidden states is depicted in
Figure 4, with the size of the nodes indicating rela-
tive frequency of each hidden state; specifically,
State 0 accounts for 63% of the corpus, States 1
and 3 account for approximately 15% each, and

This exploratory application of hidden Markov
models involves training an HMM on a mixed in-
put sequence consisting of both individual dialogue
acts and adjacency pairs. The best-fit HMM con-
sists of four hidden states whose emission symbol
probability distributions lend themselves to inter-
pretation as tutorial dialogue modes. For example,
State 0 consists primarily of tutor statements and
positive feedback, two of the most common dia-
logue acts in our corpus. The transition probabili-

ties also reveal that State 0 is highly stable; a self-
transition is most likely with probability 0.835.
State 3 is an interactive state featuring student re-
flection in the form of questions, statements, and
requests for feedback. The transition probabilities
show that nearly 60% of the time the dialogue
transitions from State 3 to State 0; this may indi-
cate that after establishing what the student does or
does not know in State 3, the tutoring switches to a
less collaborative “teaching” mode represented by
State 0.
Future evaluation of the HMM presented here
will include comparison with other types of
graphical models. Another important step is to
correlate the dialogue profile of each tutoring ses-
sion, as revealed by the HMM, to learning and af-
fective outcomes of the tutoring session. This type
of inquiry can lead directly to design recommenda-
tions for tutorial dialogue systems that aim to
maximize particular learner outcomes. In addition,
leveraging knowledge of the task state as well as
surface-level utterance content below the dialogue
act level are promising directions for refining the
descriptive and predictive power of these models.

The Akaike Information Criterion measure steadily worsened above n = 5, confirming no need to train models with n &gt; 15. likelihood Zn was used to compute the Akaike Information Criterion, a maximum-penalized likelihood estimator that penalizes more complex models (Scott, 2002). The best fit was obtained with n=4 (Figure 3). The transition probability distribution among hidden states is depicted in Figure 4, with the size of the nodes indicating relative frequency of each hidden state; specifically, State 0 accounts for 63% of the corpus, States 1 and 3 account for approximately 15% each, and State 2 accounts for 7%.

Dialogue structure information is of particular importance when the interaction is centered around a learning task, such as in natural language tutoring, because techniques that support empirical identification of dialogue strategies can inform not only the design of intelligent tutoring systems (Forbes-Riley et al., 2007), but also contribute to our understanding of the cognitive and affective processes involved in learning through tutoring (VanLehn et al., 2007). Although traditional top-down approaches (e.g., Cade et al., 2008) and some empirical work on analyzing the structure of tutorial dialogue (Forbes-Riley et al., 2007) have yielded significant results, the field is limited by the lack of an automatic, data-driven approach to identifying dialogue structure.
