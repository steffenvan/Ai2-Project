1 Evolutionary Approach to Attribute
Selection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989882352941">
We propose the use of evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) (Holland, 1992) to deal with the attribute
selection task of referring expression generation.
Evolutionary algorithms operate over a population
of individuals (possible solutions for a problem)
that evolve according to selection rules and ge-
netic operators. The fitness function is a metric
that evaluates each of the possible solutions, en-
suring that the average adaptation of the popula-
tion increases each generation. Repeating this pro-
cess hundreds or thousands of times leads to very
good solutions for the problem.
We encode as a fitness function the specific con-
straints required for the reference to be acceptable.
The crossover and mutation genetic operators en-
sure a reasonable variation between the different
options much as a human-generated text would.
Each individual is represented by a set of genes
that are the list of possible attributes in the refer-
ence. Each gene has an associated value of 0 (if the
attribute is not included in the reference), or 1 (if
the attribute is included in the reference). The ini-
tial population should have a low number of genes
set to 1, because references tend to be short and the
use of all the possible attributes should be avoided.
For the crossover operator, two individuals are
selected randomly and crossed by a random point
of their structure. For the mutation operator, some
of the genes are chosen randomly to be mutated
from 1 to 0, or vice versa.
The fitness function must find a balance be-
tween the univocal identification of a referent, and
a natural use of attributes. The formula used as
fitness function is defined in Equation 1:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.871483">
fitindi = fatti *weightatt+ident*weightid (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999711">
where ident represents whether the reference is
univocally identifying the target among the dis-
tractors, and fatti computes the role of attributes
as the normalised sum of the weight (depending
on its absolute frecuency in ATTRIBUTE-SET
elements in the corpus) of all attributes present
(gene=1), as defined by Equation 2:

2 Case-Based Reasoning for Realization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999839342857143">
Template-based solutions for natural language
generation rely on reusing fragments of text ex-
tracted from typical texts in a given domain, apply-
ing a process of abstraction that identifies which
part of them is common to all uses, and leaving
certain gaps to be filled with details correspond-
ing to a new use. A case-based solution (Aamodt
and Plaza, 1994) to reference realization can ob-
tain the information needed to realize a reference
from the original examples of appropriate use that
originated the templates.
In our approach, a case consists of a de-
scription of the problem (ATTRIBUTE-SET) and
a solution (ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING inter-
preted as a template). Cases are stored in a
Case Retrieval Net (CRN) (Lenz and Burkhard,
1996), a memory model developed to improve
the efficiency of the retrieval tasks of the
CBR cycle. Each attribute-value pair from the
ATTRIBUTE-SET is a node in the net. Templates
in ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING are considered
as solutions to the cases. Similarities between the
nodes are established for the retrieval stage of the
CBR process. For example, we have considered
that ‘back’ and ‘right’ orientation values have a
higher similarity than ‘back’ and ‘front’ that are
exactly the opposite.
The attribute-value pairs of ATTRIBUTE-SET
that must be realized in a final string are used
to query the net, which returns the more similar
cases. Only one of them must be chosen to be
adapted for the solution. We consider four differ-
ent types of retrieved cases: preferred (cases with
exactly the same attributes than the query), more
(cases with the same attributes as the query and

tribute from the query but have some extra ones),
and lessNoExtra (cases that lack some attribute
from the query and have no extra ones). The or-
der given is the preferred order to chose the most
suitable case for the query.
Adaptation of the chosen case depends on its
type. The idea is to keep all the parts of the tem-
plate that correspond to attributes common to the
query and the case. Extra attributes in the case
that do not appear in the query are discarded. At-
tributes in the query not appearing in the case are
lost.

ent systems, relying on solutions presented in last
year’s challenge.

using the NIL-UCM-MFVF solution (Gerv´as

approach.
• NIL-UCM-EvoCBR. Selects attributes us-

The results obtained by the three systems over
development data are shown in Table 1.
The evolutionary approach performs poorly but
might be improved by using a more refined al-
gorithm for calculating attribute weights, such as
done in the last year NIL-UCM-MFVF solution.
The reported CBR results were obtained over
a case base built from a selection of the avail-
able training data (samples that relied on data
not available in the input were omitted). This
approach could be further refined by generating
style-specific subsets of the case base.
