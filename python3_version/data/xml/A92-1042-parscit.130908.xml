This paper presents a model for Flexible Interactive
Guidance System (FIGS) that provides people with
instructions about natural tasks. The model is de-
veloped on the basis of a phenomenological analy-
sis of human guidance and illustrated by a system
that gives directions in geographical domains. The
instructions are provided through a dialog adapted
both in form and content to user&apos;s needs. The main
problem addressed is how to provide a user—adapted
guidance during the normal course of the guidance
dialog, without introducing a special time consuming
sub-dialog to gain information about the user&apos;s state
of knowledge.
A user-adapted guidance system must collect in-
formation about the user&apos;s knowledge of the guid-
ance domain and build a User Model (UM). It is
known that a UM can improve the behavior of dia-
log systems and contribute to the ease of their usage
and the naturalness of their response ( (Rich, 1979)).
However, a UM may also have negative effects on the
system&apos;s behavior, since the process of its acquisition
may increase both the time and the effort the user
must invest in the interaction. The model suggested
here addresses this problem by weighing the effort
required to acquire the UM against the benefits of
its usage.

2 Background

<bodyText confidence="0.999903217391304">
User modeling systems that were built during the
80s were developed for advisory systems. Early sys-
tems used an explicit method to acquire the UM (e.g.,
(Rich, 1979)). In such a method facts about the user
are provided to the UM by the user himself. This
method however, has a major drawback, since the
user who is interested in obtaining information from
the system, is forced to provide answers to a sequence
of questions posed by the system. Recently, several
methods to infer facts about the user implicitly were
suggested (see (Kass, 1990) for an overview). These
methods exploit the user&apos;s questions and the user&apos;s
answers to questions posed by the system, to indi-
rectly infer new facts about him, and are thus able to
construct a detailed UM based on a relatively short
dialog.
The explicit acquisition method was described
in the recent literature as inferior to the implicit
method because of its consumption of the user&apos;s time.
However, implicit acquisition includes a risk of miss-
ing essential facts about the user, and hence may
cause the system to provide unnecessary information
that is already known to the user.

3 Integrating Explicit and Im-
plicit Methods

The model suggested here integrates the explicit ac-
quisition method with a variety of implicit methods
in a context of a Guidance dialog. In contrast to
advisory dialogs that usually contain an interview
phase aiming to elicit from the user information re-
quired for the advice generation, in guidance interac-
tions most of the dialog consists of instructions pro-
vided by the system, and user&apos;s responses to these
instructions. Although questions to the guidance re-
cipient — the guidee — do occur, they do not con-
stitute a separate phase but are rather scattered in
the instruction sequence. In the current study and

in other studies of human guidance dialogs it was
found that in such dialogs any instruction made by
the guide is followed by a guidee&apos;s response such as
question, interruption, or confirmation-signal. In hu-
man interaction confirmation-signals are provided by
either verbal (e.g., &amp;quot;ahm&amp;quot;) or non-verbal (e.g., head
nodding) means, this can be simulated in human-
computer interaction by a special &amp;quot;continue&amp;quot; button
that is used to signal the system to move to the next
instruction.
We claim that any instruction-response pair in the
guidance sequence can serve as a basis for inferences
about the guidee. In general, each such pair type
triggers different inferences and consumes a differ-
ent amount of the user&apos;s resources (time, effort, pa-
tience). For example, inferences can be drawn from
an instruction/confirmation-signal pair; the confir-
mation signal shows that the user understands the
instruction and thus affirms the assumptions which
led to its production. Such default inferences are less
certain than those based on answers to explicit ques-
tions, but they do not consume the resources of the
guidee: No special action from him is required; in
fact the guidee may not even be aware to the fact
that inferences about him are being made. A strat-
egy of explicit questioning is justified only when the
needed fact is informative, and there was no way in
which the system could infer it from the previous
dialog. In any other case a more implicit strategy
should be preferred.
This view extends the explicit-implicit distinction
mentioned above since each utterance pair type facil-
itates a different acquisition method, and each such
method has a different level of explicitness. Our
model provides therefore, a new definition of the no-
tion of explicitness which extends the previous no-
tion in two ways. First, we distinguish between Ac-
quisition Explicitness and Transmission Explicitness,
this way the notion can be applied both for informa-
tion flowing from guide to guidee (guidance infor-
mation), and for information flowing from guidee to
guide (user modeling information). Second, we al-
low various levels of explicitness, rather than the two
extremes only. The system&apos;s explicitness level is de-
fined in terms of the interactive effort that is invested
in the dialog. This can either be the effort required
to provide a fact to the guidee, or the effort required
to acquire a fact about him.
We define FIGS as a system that provides inter-
active, user-adapted guidance, and satisfies the fol-
lowing two conditions: (1) It is equipped with a set
of instruction-acquisition strategies, each of which is
characterized by a different level of acquisition ex-
plicitness and transmission explicitness; and (2) It
has a mechanism to dynamically select a strategy.
This mechanism attempts to reach optimality with
respect to the interactive effort required for providing
the information needed by the guidee.
The suggested model implements the forego-
ing considerations, it includes four instruction-
acquisition strategies: (1) Question - the user pro-
vides a needed fact, (2) Explanation - no facts about
the user are used, (3) Explicit Assumption - the in-
struction is based on an assumption about the user,
and the assumption is mentioned, and (4) Implicit
Assumption - an assumption is used without men-
tioning it.
A major feature of our model is that UM acqui-
sition considerations are integrated into the FIGS&apos;s
utterance planning process. Hence, the user mod-
eling and the instruction generation are done incre-
mentally by inter-related processes. We use heuris-
tic rules to select among the four strategies; these
rules weigh four discourse parameters: information
content, user knowledge (as described by the current
UM), likelihood to acquire new facts about the user,
and consumption of user&apos;s resources.
The computational model we suggested was imple-
mented by a computer program (called FIGS1) that
offers directional instructions in a complex university
building. FIGS1 uses heuristic rules to control both
the strategy selection and the UM construction. A
more detailed exposition of our model and its im-
plementation can be found in (Shifroni &amp; Shanon,
1991), and (Shifroni &amp; Oman, 1991).
