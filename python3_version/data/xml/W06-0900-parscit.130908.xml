Workshop Description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873565217391">
The computational analysis of time is a challenging and very topical problem, as the needs of applications
based on information extraction techniques expand to include varying degrees of time stamping and
temporal ordering of events and/or relations within a narrative. The challenges derive from the combined
requirements of a mapping process (text to a rich representation of temporal entities), representational
framework (ontologically-grounded temporal graph), and reasoning capability (combining common-
sense inference with temporal axioms).
Usually contextualized in question-answering applications (with obvious dependencies of answers on
time), temporal awareness directly impacts numerous areas of NLP and AI: text summarization over
events and their participants; making inferences from events in a text; overlaying timelines on document
collections; commonsense reasoning in narrative and story understanding.
Interest in temporal analysis and event-based reasoning has spawned a number of important meetings,
particularly as applied to IE and QA tasks (cf. at COLING 2000; ACL 2001; LREC 2002; TERQAS
2002; TANGO 2003, Dagstuhl 2005). Significant progress has been made in these meetings, leading to
developing a standard for a specification language for events and temporal expressions and their orderings
(TimeML). While recent research in the broader community (as indicated, for instance, in the most
recent symposium on Annotating and Reasoning about Time and Events) highlights TimeML’s status
as an interchange format, this workshop, however, is not intended to focus on TimeML exclusively.
Likewise, while the ultimate goal of temporal analysis is to facilitate reasoning about time and events,
the formal aspects of this problem are being addressed by other meetings (see, for instance, the TIME
2006 Symposium). Instead, the workshop will explore largely the linguistic implications for temporal-
analytical frameworks.
The goal of the meeting, therefore, is to address issues already raised, but not fully explored – including
but not limited to the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9989608">
• infrastructure questions: temporal annotation methodology, tools; reliable measures of inter-
annotator agreement; community resources.
• analytical frameworks: temporal information extraction; approaches to temporal expression
normalization; relationship between named entity recognition and temporal entities analysis;
dependency (or not) upon syntactic and discourse structure.
• mapping to time ontology(ies): completeness of the representation framework; formalization of
the process; additional temporal reasoning capabilities required.
• reasoning over time: in particular, (robust) reasoning within representational schemes
demonstrably derivable with current IE/analytical frameworks.
• applications of temporal analytics and reasoning: in addition to NL tasks, of particular interest are
studies of temporal information as it manifests in, and impacts, different domains: beyond news,
time is intrinsically essential in e.g., legal, health-care, intelligence, financial contexts.
• national language: relationship between language characteristics and representational frameworks;
generalizations of temporal analytics across multiple languages; multi-/cross-lingual resource
development.

Target Audience and Participants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932142857143">
This workshop will be of interest to those creating or exploiting temporally annotated corpora; those
developing information extraction, question answering, and summarization systems relying on temporal
and event ordering information; researchers involved in creating chronicles and timelines from textual
data (legal, health-care, intelligence); semantic web designers and developers wanting to link web
ontologies and standards to temporal markup from natural language; researchers interested in temporal
properties of discourse and narrative structure; and those interested in annotation environments and
development tools. For more details, refer to http://www.acl2006time.org.
