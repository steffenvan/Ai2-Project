<bodyText confidence="0.999972933333333">
A multimedia blog creation system is de-
scribed that uses Japanese dialogue with an
intelligent robot. Although multimedia
blogs are increasing in popularity, creating
blogs is not easy for users who lack high-
level information literacy skills. Even
skilled users have to waste time creating
and assigning text descriptions to their
blogs and searching related multimedia
such as images, music, and illustrations. To
enable effortless and enjoyable creation of
multimedia blogs, we developed the system
on a prototype robot called PaPeRo. Video
messages are recorded and converted into
text descriptions by PaPeRo using continu-
ous speech recognition. PaPeRo then
searches for suitable multimedia contents
on the internet and databases, and then,
based on the search results, chooses appro-
priate sympathetic comments by using
natural language text retrieval. The re-
trieved contents, PaPeRo&apos;s comments, and
the video recording on the user&apos;s blog is
automatically uploaded and edited. The
system was evaluated by 10 users for creat-
ing travel blogs and proved to be helpful
for both inexperienced and experienced us-
ers. The system enabled easy multimedia-
rich blog creation and even provided users
the pleasure of chatting with PaPeRo.

ganizations. A multimedia blog, which contains
videos, music, and illustrations, is increasing in
popularity because it enables users to express their
thoughts creatively. However, users are unsatisfied
with the current multimedia blog creation methods.
Users have three requirements. First, they need
easier methods to create blogs. Most multimedia
blogs are created in one of two ways: 1) A user
creates audio-visual contents by cameras and or
some other recording devices, and then assigns a
text description to the contents as indexes. 2) A
user creates a text blog, and then searches for mul-
timedia contents on the internet and databases to
attach them to his blog. Both methods require
high-level information literacy skills. Second, they
would like to reduce their blog-creation time. Even
skilled users have to waste time assigning text de-
scription and searching related multimedia con-
tents. Third, they like to be encouraged by other
peoples’ comments on their blogs. Although some
users utilize pet-type agents making automatic
comments to their blogs, the agents do not always
satisfy them because the comments do not consider
users&apos; moods. To meet the three requirements, we
developed a multimedia blog creation system using
Japanese dialogue with an intelligent robot. The
system was developed on a prototype robot called
PaPeRo (Fujita, 2002), which has the same CPU
and memory as a mobile PC. In this paper, we de-
scribe the multimedia blog creation method and
the evaluation results in a practical setting.

2 Multimedia Blog Creation

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.972131">
2.1 Outline of system processes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98148776">
The system has four sequential processes: video
message recording, continuous speech recognition,
natural language text retrieval, and blog coordina-

tion. The first process is activated when a user be-
gins a conversation with PaPeRo. The process
stores a video message recorded on PaPeRo&apos;s mi-
crophones and CCD cameras, and the second
process converts the speech contents of the video
message into a text description to extract important
keywords. Then, the third process searches for
suitable multimedia contents on pre-specified web
sites and databases based on the text description.
The first three processes can simplify multimedia
blog creation and reduce creation costs. The last
process detects a user’s mood, such as delight, an-
ger, sorrow, and pleasure, by extracting typical
expressions from the text description, and then
chooses appropriate sympathetic comments to en-
courage the user. Finally, the last process coordi-
nates uploading the recorded video message, the
text description, the extracted keywords, the
searched contents, and the sympathetic comments
on the user&apos;s blog.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999747">
2.2 Continuous Speech Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999073235294117">
The system converts the speech content of the
video message into text descriptions and extracts
important keywords based on their lexical infor-
mation. The system should, therefore, be equipped
with a large-vocabulary continuous speech recog-
nition engine capable of dealing with spontaneous
speech. This is because blog messages usually con-
tain various kinds of words and expressions. As
this kind of engine needs a large amount of mem-
ory and computational resources, it is generally
difficult to install the engine on small intelligent
robots because the robot requires its own computa-
tional resources for their own intelligent operations,
such as image recognition and movement control.
To solve this problem, we used a compact and
scalable large-vocabulary continuous speech rec-
ognition framework, which has been shown to
work on low-power devices, such as PDAs (Isotani
et al.,2005). The framework achieves compact and
high-speed processing by the following techniques:
- Efficient reduction of Gaussian components us-
ing MDL criterion (Shinoda, et al., 2002)
- High-speed likelihood calculation using tree-
structured probability density functions (Wata-
nabe, et al., 1995)
- Compaction of search algorithm using lexical
prefix tree and shared usage of calculated lan-
guage model scores (Isotani et al., 2005)
The framework we developed contained a Japanese
lexicon of 50,000 words typically used in travel
conversations based on a speech translation system
(Isotani, et al., 2002). We were able to evaluate the
developed system by making a travel blog using
Japanese dialogue with PaPeRo.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998049">
2.3 Natural Language Text Retrieval
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997825">
The system generates a query sentence from a
text description converted using the above-
mentioned framework. As few multimedia contents
contain retrieval keywords, the system matches the
query to text in web pages and documents contain-
ing multimedia contents. The system then chooses
multimedia contents located adjacent to the highly-
matched text as retrieval results. To achieve high
precision for avoiding user interaction with the
retrieved results, the system is enhanced using the
Okapi BM25 model (Robertson, et al., 1995) by
the following techniques (Ikeda, et al., 2005):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977476">
(1) Utilization of syntactic relationships
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99962">
The system needs to distinguish illustrations
based on the context. For example, an illustration
of fish to be eaten in a restaurant should be differ-
ent from that of fish to be seen in an aquarium. To
achieve this, the system utilizes the syntactic rela-
tionships between a pair of words. The system
produces a higher score for text containing the
same syntactic relationship as that of a pair of
words in a query sentence when calculating the
matching score.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.869865">
(2) Distinction of negation and affirmation
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976108">
The system needs to distinguish negative and af-
firmative expressions because their meanings are
clearly opposite. To achieve this, the system
checks adjuncts attached to the expressions when
matching a query sentence and text.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.970739">
(3) Identification of synonyms
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999295">
As different expressions have the same meaning,
the system normalizes expressions by using a
synonym dictionary containing 500 words before
matching a query sentence and text.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992248">
2.4 Blog Coordination
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999326428571429">
The system detects users’ mood to choose en-
couraging comments. Users’ moods are sometimes
detected by the expressions used and the manner in
which the utterances are spoken. Although speak-
ing manner can clearly detect emotions, such as
laughing or crying, some emotions are not always
indicated. Expressions that clearly identify a per-

son’s mood can be indicated (Nakamura, 1993).
By studying moods that are easily detectable from
expressions, including modality, we developed a
database of 10 moods (delight, anger, sorrow,
pleasure, desire, fear, shame, relief, surprise, and
normal) individually linked with 100 kinds of spe-
cific expressions. The database is searched based
on the above-mentioned natural language text re-
trieval, which considers syntactic relationships,
negative and affirmative responses, and synonyms.
The database is also linked to PaPeRo’s response
to convey the most appropriate sympathy for each
mood. The response includes verbal comments,
such as “I&apos;m happy for you” and “It&apos;s really too
bad”, and gestures, such as dancing and crying de-
picted using GIF animation files. Responses are
chosen based on the mood detected. Finally, the
system coordinates uploading a recorded video
message, the text description, the extracted impor-
tant keywords, the searched multimedia contents,
and PaPeRo’s responses on the user&apos;s blog.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.925461" genericHeader="method">
3 Example Use in Practical Setting
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975176">
We developed a prototype system for creating a
travel blog on PaPeRo, which can retrieve 2000
web pages containing 1500 illustrations and 550
songs. PaPeRo is activated by hearing the phrase,
“can you help me make my blog please?”, as listed
in Table. 1, and creates a blog, as shown in Figure
1. Figure 1 shows a screen shot of a video message
attached to the blog, a text description converted
by the speech recognition and a button for playing
the video message (A). Keywords, in this case Yo-
semite, Las Vegas, and Roulette, extracted from
the text description are displayed (B). Three illus-
trations searched based on a query using the text
description are displayed (C). A button for playing
a searched song is available (D). PaPeRo’s com-
ments, such as “I hope that happens”, are displayed
(E). The user’s mood is detected as desire from her
saying “I would like to go there again.” The com-
ment is displayed together with the appropriate
PaPeRo’s response.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996322">
4.1 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996133333333">
The system needs to be evaluated from two per-
spectives. The first is to individually evaluate the
performance of each process mentioned in section
2. The second is to evaluate total performance, in-
cluding the users’ subjective opinions. As per-
formance has been evaluated using different appli-
cation systems, such as an automatic speech trans-
lation system (Isotani, et al., 2002) and a speech-
activated text retrieval system (Ikeda, et al., 2005),
we concentrated on evaluating the total perform-
ance based on surveying users’ opinions about the
blogs they created using the developed system. The
survey results were analyzed in terms of speech
recognition accuracy and users’ blog making ex-
perience to improve the system.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.906071">
4.2 Results and Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929214285714">
The system was evaluated by 10 users. Half had
blog making experiences, and the other half had
no experience at all. All users input 20 sentences,
and half of the sentences input were on travel is-
sues, but the other half were unrelated because we
needed opinions based on the results from low
speech recognition accuracy. Users were inter-
viewed on their automatically created blogs.
Their opinions are listed in Table 2. The first row
contains opinions about blogs created based on
speech recognition results that had high word ac-
curacy (85-95%). The second row contains opin-
ions that had low accuracy (50-84%). The third
row shows opinions regardless of the accuracy.

The left column contains opinions of users with
blog-making experience. The middle column con-
tains opinions of inexperienced users. The right
column shows opinions regardless of the experi-
ence. The table leads to the following discussion:
(1) Expectations for multimedia blog creation
Users were satisfied with the system when high
speech recognition accuracy was used regardless
of their blog-making experience. Some users ex-
pected that the system could promote spread of
multimedia contents with index keywords, even
though few multimedia contents currently have
indexes for retrieval.
(2) Robustness and tolerability for low accuracy
Users understood the results when low speech
recognition accuracy was used because the mul-
timedia content search is still fairly successful
when keywords are accurately recognized, even
though the total accuracy is not high. Users can
appreciate the funny side of speech recognition
errors and unexpected multimedia contents from
PaPeRo’s mistakes. However, as the errors do not
always lead to amusing results, an edit interface
should be equipped to improve keywords, illus-
trations and the total blog page layout.
(3) More expectations of dialogue with PaPeRo
Users would like to more enjoy themselves with
PaPeRo, regardless of the speech recognition ac-
curacy. They expect PaPeRo to give them more
information, such as track-back and comments,
based on dialogue history. As PaPeRo stores all
the messages in himself, he has the ability to gen-
erate more sophisticated comments and track-
back messages with users. Also, when the dia-
logue scenario is improved, he can ask the users
some encouraging questions to make their blog
more interesting and attractive while recording
their video messages.

We developed a multimedia blog creation system
using Japanese dialogue with an intelligent robot.
The system was developed on PaPeRo for creating
travel blogs and was evaluated by 10 users. Results
showed that the system was effective for inexperi-
enced and experienced users. The system enabled
easy and simple creation of multimedia-rich blogs,
while enabling users the pleasure of chatting with
PaPeRo. We plan to improve the system by sup-
porting the edit interface and enhancing the dia-
logue scenario so that users can enjoy themselves
with more sophisticated and complex interaction
with PaPeRo.
