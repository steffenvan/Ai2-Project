in this book as machine translation for
dissemination, with particular emphasis on
choosing a target-language term that not
only adequately renders the source language
term, but also is the going term in the partic-
ular sub-language of that text. The high-level
goal is to produce translations that read as
fluently and as competently as text on the
same topic written in the target language.
The introduction argues for separating lin-
guistic from world knowledge, claiming that
linguistic knowledge alone can yield full-
blown semantic modeling, at least within the
somewhat limited domain of a sub-language.
The author claims that semantic modeling
is required for machine translation and sets
his sub-language to be party political programs
in German. This sub-language, he argues, is
rich enough to be more than a toy domain
but stylized enough to limit the size of the
dictionary to be developed.
Chapter 2 details the importance of the
co-text for disambiguation and the impor-
tant role of coherence and cohesion in the
reception of text, thought to be embodied
in a thesaurus of synonyms. Chapter 3 then
tears into the &amp;quot;sentence-based&amp;quot; approach of
most traditional machine translation systems
because it leads to a statistical determina-
tion of the equivalence of isolated signs in
two languages and cannot yield pragmatic
equivalence. Chapter 4 introduces some of
the technical contributions of the book. A dic-
tionary of thesaural relations of 200 nouns is
compiled for the selected &amp;quot;corpus&amp;quot; of party
programs of 60,000 words. The stylistically
pure corpus is intended to yield stylistically
adequate thesaural relations, i.e., pragmat-
ically equivalent translations. Disambigua-
tion proceeds by weighting and counting
co-occurrence of the noun with any of the
synonyms, near synonyms, or significantly
co-occurring adjectives of the analysis dic-
tionary that occur within a window which
varies from four words to seven sentences,
depending on the phase of the attempted dis-
ambiguation process. Three phases with in-
creasingly relaxed constraints on the match-
ing procedure are possible; the process stops
when disambiguation is achieved.
A separate transfer dictionary is described
in Chapter 5, again of the form of thesaural
relations paired with translation equivalents,
now for the noun in question when occurring
in the environment of one or more of the con-
textually relevant terms. These translation
equivalents are found by poring over &amp;quot;par-
allel texts,&amp;quot; by which Laffling means texts
of the same sub-language and style that ad-
dress similar points. Chapter 6 summarizes
the effort as based on linguistic principles
and points out several shortcomings, such
as not testing the system on texts that were
not part of the corpus from which the dic-
tionaries were compiled, differences in per-
formance when dealing with (wordy) party
programs (good performance) and (concise)
party manifestos (worse performance), and
lack of any attempt to put together the pro-
posed translation equivalents to actually pro-
duce a target-language text.
The book presents these ideas awkwardly
hidden in a text that violates all the expec-
tations I have for a computational linguistics
volume. The algorithms and procedures are
not declared explicitly; the data are not de-
scribed in detail; no attempt at evaluation of
the procedures or the resulting dictionaries
is made; the discussion of the literature fo-
cuses on old work (Schank&apos;s original scripts
are discussed at length) and tends to set up
straw men for easy rebuttal. The tone is at
times unnecessarily polarizing. But most ag-
gravating is the style of presentation. The
author does not state his points clearly and
gives no data-supported arguments for and
against his claims. Instead he selects disem-
bodied quotes from a wide range of authors
to stand in for what he wants to say. These
quotes are frequently in German, sometimes
in French, without any translation. The work
of the quoted authors is not summarized and
does not always lend credence to the point
Laffling has in mind. (Most amusing to me
was the use of a quote by Pustejovsky to ex-
emplify how &amp;quot;R. Schank and others involved
on the Yale Project argue that connectivity is
only implicit in a text... &amp;quot; [p. 48].)
The system is implemented on a PC in
Basic, and much of the (little) technical dis-
cussion centers on working around these ar-

tificial limitations. The presented dictionar-
ies appear to have been compiled by hand
from some corpus analysis (concordances are
hinted at) and (arbitrarily?) refined until they
perform the task of disambiguating occur-
rences in the corpus and suggesting the most
suitable translation for that word (or phrase).
The 22-page bibliography (over 10% of the
length of the book!) was out of date even
at the date of publication (1991), the newest
reference being from 1989. But with its focus
on older and European publications, it does
provide a complementary set of references
that are often unavailable in North Ameri-
can libraries (and publications). The useful-
ness of this extensive bibliography is, how-
ever, lessened by the fact that the text cannot
be trusted to serve as an annotation to it.
Overall, the book leaves the reader with
the uneasy feeling of having missed out
on a thorough introduction into interesting
research and having been forced to read
through a thesis.—Sabine Bergler, Concordia

Walker, a kind, gentle soul, and a man of in-
telligence and vision whom we have been
privileged to know and to work with. The
technical content of these papers clearly re-
flects his guidance and direction: his under-

based analysis. This led to one of his most
interdisciplinary roles, as a primary mover
in the push to standardize the acquisition
and tagging of electronic text, an endeavor
that brought together people from fields as
distinct as publishing, the humanities and
computer science. His wide-spread interests
are mirrored in the rich and diverse collec-
tion of papers in this volume which por-
tray many different approaches and many
different styles. These papers co-exist in har-
mony here, united by the goal of paying trib-
ute to Don as well as actualizing part of
this dream.&amp;quot;—From the introduction by Martha
