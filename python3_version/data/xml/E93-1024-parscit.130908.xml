Kaplan et al. (1989) present a framework
for translation based on the description
and correspondence concepts of Lexical-
Functional Grammar (Kaplan and
Bresnan, 1982). Certain phenomena, in
particular the head-switching of adverbs
and verbs, seem to be problematic for that
approach. In this paper we suggest that
these difficulties are more properly
considered as the result of defective
monolingual analyses. We propose a new
description-language operator, restriction,
to permit a succinct formal encoding of the
informal intuition that semantic units
sometimes correspond to subsets of
functional information. This operator, in
conjunction with an additional recursion
provided by a description-by-analysis rule,
is the basis of a more adequate account of
head-switching that preserves the
advantages of correspondence-based
translation.

Kaplan et al. (1989) present a framework for
translation based on the description and
correspondence concepts of Lexical-Functional
Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). LFG
formulates the syntactic dependencies and
generalizations of natural languages in terms of
the properties of formal structures of different
types: ordinary phrase-structure trees represent
the surface constituency of sentences while
hierarchical finite functions represent their
underlying grammatical relations. The
structures for a particular sentence are those that
satisfy descriptions produced from annotated
phrase-structure rules and lexical entries. The
description of the more abstract functional
structure is determined by the dominance and
precedence relations of the superficial
constituent structure, given the assumption that
there is a piecewise correspondence function that
maps the nodes in the c-structure tree into the
units of the f-structure. Kaplan (1987) and
Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988) extend this
structure/description/correspondence architec-
ture to provide modular and declarative
characterizations of the relationships between
syntactic structures and other levels of linguistic
representation. Kaplan et al. (1989) suggest that
this architecture can provide a formal basis for
specifying complex source-target translation
relationships in a declarative fashion that builds
on monolingual grammars and lexicons that are
independently motivated and theoretically
justified. In particular, the approach permits
features from different linguistic levels to affect
translation without requiring that reflexes of
those disparate features appear together in an
otherwise unmotivated transfer or interlingual
representation.
Kaplan et al. (1989) offer several examples
to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach to
translation. These examples involve changes in
grammatical functions from source to target,
differences in control, and differences in
embedding (or head-switching). The Kaplan et
al. solutions depend on monolingual
representations of phrasal, functional, and
semantic information related by the
correspondences 4:1) and a, with translation

<bodyText confidence="0.985351">
These solutions utilize the formal device of
codescription to specify the target structure
constraints in terms of simple compositions of the
-c and me mappings with the monolingual source
correspondences. For instance, the fact that the
object of the German beantworten corresponds to
the AOBJ of the French repondre is indicated by
associating the following transfer equations with
the normal monolingual lexical entry for
beantworten:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.906274">
(2) (&amp;quot;u PRED FN) = repondre
SUBJ) = &amp;quot;c( t SUBJ)
AOBJ) = OBJ)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917952380953">
The last line asserts that the AOBJ in the target
f-structure is the translation of the source OBJ.
The metavariable in LFG is an abbreviation
for 4)(M(*)) and thus denotes the f-structure that
corresponds to the mother of the beantworten
lexical node in the German c-structure (indicated
by *). The expression -c can then be seen as
T(4)(M(*))) = 4)(M(*)) and thus as incorporating
the composition c 4). Significantly, the M(*)
term is also present, which means that the target
constraints are determined in the same recursive
analysis of the source c-structure that is used to
derive the source f-structure description. The
codescription device crucially involves both a
composition of correspondences and a single
recursive analysis of common ancestor
structures. This contrasts with description-
by-analysis, another technique mentioned by
Kaplan and Halvorsen (1988) and Kaplan et al.
(1989) for deriving descriptions of abstract
structures.

2. Difficulties with the
correspondence approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838131578948">
This proposal for correspondence-based
translation has been scrutinized by a number of
researchers (e.g. Sadler et al., 1989, Sadler et al.,
1990, Sadler and Thompson, 1991), and several
difficulties have been pointed out. These
difficulties arise particularly in cases where the
independently motivated source and target
structures are not very closely aligned, where
single units in a source structure map to multiple
units in the target (so-called splitting) or where
hierarchical relationships are interchanged in
mapping from source to target (switching). If
such discrepancies are both locally bounded and
predictable, then they can in principle be handled
by means of codescription statements involving
the ordinary monolingual description-language
constructs of function-application and equality.
But even if possible, such conservative
treatments may not permit obvious
generalizations about the translation relation to
be naturally expressed. Sadler et al. (1990)
demonstrate this point by examples in which the
translation of a lexical head differs according to
its dependents in the source sentence (English
commit suicide translates to French (se) suicider
whereas commit a crime translates to cornmettre
une crime). They suggest refining the basic
correspondence approach by separating such
idiosyncratic source-target interactions into a
separate transfer lexicon whose stipulations will
override (perhaps via the priority union operator)
the generic transfer specifications that might
still be associated with the source-language
predicates.
Sadler et al. (1989) and Sadler and
Thompson (1991) focus on another case of
structural misalignment in translation, as
illustrated in (3):
</bodyText>

(3) (a) The baby just fell.
(b) Le bebe vient de tomber.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999568714285714">
The syntactic head of the English sentence (fell)
corresponds to the head of the French embedded
complement (tomber), while the English adjunct
just corresponds to the head of the French matrix.
Other well-known contrasts show syntactic
embeddings in English corresponding to
sentential adjuncts in Dutch (and German):

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.962786352941176">
Kaplan et al. (1989) discussed such differences in
embedding and offered two alternative analyses
that rely only on codescriptive specifications. On
one account, head-switching is accomplished by
mapping the source S node to an f-structure that
contains information about the central clausal
relations but excludes adjunct information. The
ADV node maps to an f-structure that has the
adverb as its main predicate with the central
clausal f-structure appearing in argument
position. The &apos;just&apos; f-structure, though not
accessible from the S node, maps through t to the
outermost target f-structure. This complex
interchange is specified in the lexical entry and
rule in (5) and is diagrammed in Figure 1
(ignoring such details as person, number, case,
and tense).

<listItem confidence="0.934158">

(b) S NP (ADV) VP
( T SUBJ) = ARG)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875142857143">
In the second proposal, a completely integrated
source f-structure maps to a single integrated
target structure. As specified by the rule (6), the
adverb is assigned an adjunct grammatical
function in the source and its translation includes
the translation of the enclosing source f-structure
as its XCOMP, as shown in Figure 2.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.96199">

( T SUBJ) = (i&apos; ADJ) =

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999565375">
inadequacy of both these arrangements. Even
though the proper target embeddings are derived
under both correspondence configurations, in
neither case does the translation of the
f-structure of the source S node include the
translation of the adverb. This shows up as a
problem when such examples are embedded as
complements in larger sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9998725">
(7) (a) I think that the baby just fell.
(b) Je pense que le bebe vient de tomber.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9262822">
To maintain modularity, the codescriptive lexical
entry for think must provide a direct mapping to
the French penser that is not sensitive to the
internal structure of the complement, along the
lines of (8):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.91779425">

(I PRED) = &apos;think &lt;( mu) ( I COMP ) &gt;

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99780175">
But then the translation f-structure constraints
will characterize the pair of structures (9); these
share the common tomber substructure but are
otherwise unrelated.

The t constraints thus leave unspecified the
relative scopes of the penser and venir predicates.
As Sadler et al. (1989) observe, the problem is
even worse when several adverbs appear
together: there is no obvious way to modify
either of the rules (5b) or (6) to account for the
scope interactions among the adverbs, let alone
their relations to higher predicates.
Sadler et al. (1989) and Sadler and
Thompson (1991) consider several ways in which
the translation constraints might be modified to
circumvent these difficulties yet remain faithful
to the spirit of the correspondence-based
approach. While each of their proposals is
carefully worked out, they conclude (and we
agree) that none of them is completely
satisfactory or particularly compelling. The
reason, we believe, is that the head-switching
with adverbial modifiers that shows up as a
problem in correspondence-based translation is
actually a symptom of a more fundamental error
in the syntactic and semantic analysis of the
source language. In sentences with adverbial
modifiers, the syntactic head (which controls
subcategorization and enters into agreement
relations) is not the same as the semantic head
(the predicate with widest scope). Moreover,
normal linguistic arguments would assign a flat
f-structure to sentences with several adverbs
while meaning relations would be represented in
a hierarchical semantic structure. Thus on this
view, if translation codescriptions map from the
proper hierarchical semantic structures via if
instead of from flat f-structures via 1, adverbial
head-switching disappears as a special problem
for correspondence-based translation.
Sadler and Thompson (1991, footnote 1)
mention the arrangement we are proposing, and
observe that the translation codescription
problems may then merely be displaced to
equivalent difficulties in characterizing the
monolingual a instead oft: the problems may be
moved around and renamed, but not solved. This
may be so, but any conceptual clarification in
such a murky domain must be regarded as an
advance, if only because it helps to spotlight the
issues that are relevant to a solution and to
connect them to other related phenomena.
Indeed, we now suggest that adverbial
head-switching is a special case of the general
problem of mapping flat syntactic structures to
hierarchical semantic ones. So-called &amp;quot;light
verbs&amp;quot;, complex-predicates, and clause-union
phenomena in many languages are similarly
difficult to handle in LFG using only
codescription, attribute-value function-
application, and equality constraints (or using
the analogous formal devices of other theories,
such as attribute-value unification over signs or
categories). In the next section of this paper, we
extend LFG&apos;s f-structure description language by
introducing a new formal operator, called
restriction. We illustrate its properties by
applying it to a simple light-predicate sentence in
Urdu. In Section 4 we combine restriction with
description-by-analysis to characterize the
appropriate hierarchical semantic structures for
English sentential adverbs. At the end, we
return to the head-switching problem of
correspondence-based translation, providing a
simple solution in terms of the if correspondence.

3. The restriction operator and

<bodyText confidence="0.999915333333333">
A simple kind of syntax/semantics misalignment
is exemplified by constructions involving
light-verbs or complex predicates. These are
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995748">

<bodyText confidence="0.999972333333333">
constructions formed by two or more verbs
involving two or more semantic relations, but
with the notable peculiarity that the complex
behaves as a single, monoclausal syntactic unit
according to standard tests of subcategorization
and agreement. Butt et al. (1990) have argued
persuasively that Urdu complex predicates are
syntactically monoclausal and further, that the
complex predicate cannot be formed in the
lexicon. The details of the argument do not
matter for present purposes, and we will simply
accept their analysis of sentence (10a) whose
English translation is given in (10b). The c-, f-,
and semantic-structures, according to their
analysis, are shown in Figure 3.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99922">

(b) Anjum let Saddaf write a letter.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999832586206897">
The crucial feature of this analysis is that there is
a single set of governed grammatical functions in
the f-structure, and these are derived
systematically from the normal
subcategorization of the main predicate likhne
&apos;write&apos;. The governable functions of diyaa when it
stands as an independent predicate (usually
glossed as the ditransitive predicate &apos;give&apos;) are
not represented in the f-structure. The second
obvious feature is that the flat f-structure maps
to the hierarchical semantic structure, where the
outer predicate has the permissive reading
conveyed by diyaa in its light-verb sense and the
inner proposition contains the main predicate
and its arguments. This analysis cannot be
formulated using standard codescription,
function-application, and equality because there
is no separate level in the f-structure that the
inner semantic proposition can correspond to and
thus no way to describe its properties.
While there may be a technical problem in
finding a structure that the inner proposition can
correspond to, there is a very clear intuition
about what parts of the f-structure carry the
information that constrains that piece of the
semantic structure, namely, the sub-f-structure
obtained by eliminating the SUBJ attribute and
value. The following diagram depicts this
intuition:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.804821">
(11)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999138125">
In this arrangement the semantic correspondence
a relates each level of the semantic structure to a
unit in f-structure space, and that unit is the
source of constraints on the properties of the
corresponding element of the semantic structure.
The ARG3 hierarchy in the semantic structure is
not the image of an attribute embedding in the
f-structure as is usually the case; rather, the
semantic hierarchy here corresponds to a
subsumption relation in the f-structure lattice.
This organization of informational dependencies
can be expressed by means of the restriction
operator.
Restriction is a new operator in the
f-structure description language notated by 1 and

(12) If f is an f-structure and a is an attribute:

The restriction of a given f-structure f by a

Restriction is a designator analogous to ordinary
function-application in that it provides a way of
referring to elements of f-structure space by
virtue of their relations to other f-structures. If f
and g are two f-structure designators and a
denotes an attribute, then
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.820015">

attribute a with exactly the same
value; they may or may not have other
attributes and values in common.
f la= gla
asserts that f and g have all attributes
and values in common other than a;
they may or may not have values for a
and those values may or may not be
identical.
Thus, restriction and function-application can be
used to impose complementary constraints on
f-structure values. We note that restriction is
associative and commutative in its second
(attribute) argument, so that [f\al\b = [f\bl\a =
f\fa bl, and that for any f-structure f and
attribute a it is always the case that f\a
subsumes f (f \a E f).
Returning now to the Urdu example, we see
that if the top-level f-structure (the one
corresponding to the S node) is denoted by f, the
subsidiary f-structure to which corresponds the
inner proposition in (11) is the restriction off by
SUBJ and can be referred to by the expression
rsuBJ. The restriction operator can be used in
codescription statements so that exactly the
configuration in (11) is assigned to the Urdu
sentence. A lexical redundancy rule can be
introduced to systematically modify the lexical
entries for normal verbs like likhne to make them
suitable for combination with a light-verb:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.848268">
(15) (1 SUBJ) —+ ( OBJ2 )
a &apos;t \SUBJ]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918">
This rule replaces all references to the
grammatical function SUBJ with OBJ2, thus
avoiding conflict with the SUBJ introduced by the
light verb, and it replaces all occurrences of the
term a with the term a( t \sum. This indicates
that the main predicate provides constraints on
the semantic structure corresponding to the
subject-free f-structure. As a result of this rule,
the usual equations for likhne in (16a) would give
rise to the alternatives in (16b):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.74934925">
(16) (a) (at ARGO = a( SUBJ)

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999654333333333">
The lexical rule would also make other minor
adjustments to fill out the entry; the details do
not concern us here.

<bodyText confidence="0.999849142857143">
Sentence with adverbial modifiers can also be
characterized intuitively as having a flat
syntactic structure with hierarchical semantic
relations, and restriction can also be used to
describe the appropriate structural
configurations. The adverbial examples above
involve only single sentential adjuncts, but our
analysis allows for any number of adverbs with
all possible scope ambiguities, and it can easily
be extended to handle VP modifiers as well. We
start with a c-structure rule that assigns
arbitrarily many adverbs to the set-value of the
ADJ attribute, consistent with the original LFG
account of adjuncts (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982):

<bodyText confidence="0.999687666666667">
Intuitively, the innermost proposition in both
(19a) and (19b) is based on the f-structure
information in (18b) ignoring the adjuncts; the
middle proposition in (19a) is exactly what we
would expect for a sentence that included just but
not obviously, and the middle proposition in (19b)
would be appropriate for a sentence containing
only obviously. Thus the semantic structures
again seem to correspond to subsets of f-structure
information, and we begin by completing the
definition of the restriction operator. In addition
to restricting an f-structure by an attribute, as
defined in (12), we also define the restriction of an
f-structure by an element of an attribute&apos;s
set-value:

The restriction of a given f-structure f by a
particular member of an attribute a&apos;s set-value is
the f-structure that results from deleting that
member of the set and also deleting the attribute
itself if the set would then be empty. The
relationships in (21) exemplify the pattern:

the outermost REL and ARG1 configuration in

The innermost proposition can be described by
interpreting (or redundantly rewriting) a in the
cod escription equations in the fall lexical entry as
a( \ADJ], that is, by interpreting the a
specifications for all basic predicates as
characterizing the semantics of an unmodified
f-structure.
The restriction constraints in (23) are
sufficient to map f-structure sub sumption
relations into the desired hierarchical semantic
structures, but the number of such constraints
depends on the size of the initial adjunct set;
indeed, (23d) suggests that the size of individual
constraints used in this construction also grows
in proportion to the number of modifiers.
Constraints of this general form cannot be
produced by the normal recursive analysis of the
c-structure because the c-structure itself, by
linguistic argumentation, does not have the
degree of embedding that these constraints would
require. The restriction operator can encode the
intuitively desirable constraints, but an
additional recursive process is needed to generate
those constraints. This recursion can arise from
an explicit traversal of the f-structure in the style
of Halvorsen&apos;s (1983) semantic interpretation
procedure. It can also come from lexical
expressions of inside-out functional uncertainty;
this formal device was introduced by Kaplan
(1988) and has been applied to problems of
quantifier scope (Halvorsen and Kaplan, 1988)
and anaphoric dependencies (Dalrymple, 1993).

generate codescriptive assertions:
(24) For fan f-structure, g E (f ADJ), and g a
sentence adverb,
crf = ckg and

According to this rule, a single element is chosen
(nondeterministically) from an adjunct set to
contribute the relation for the semantic structure
of the enclosing f-structure, and the semantic
structure corresponding to the f-structure
without the chosen element becomes that
relation&apos;s argument. One application of the rule
gives rise to additional structures to which the
rule might also apply, and this recursion
generates the appropriate set of constraints. For
example, suppose f is the f-structure in (18b) and
the obviously f-structure o is chosen as the
instantiation of g in the rule. This produces the
equations (23a,b) which define the configuration
shown in (25). The rule then matches again
against the lower f-structure, thereby completing
the picture (26).

however, is to provide a natural hierarchical

These involve the codescriptive composition of
and a together with the 4:1 and M that are implicit

the lexicon, grammar, and description-
by-analysis rules, these define the translation
configuration outlined in Figure 4. The
restriction f-structure that the fall semantic
substructure corresponds to is not shown in the
figure, but as we have seen, it is crucial to the
declarative, order-free construction of the
embedded head-switching translation. This
arrangement shifts the translation burden for
adverbial modifiers from the f-structure to the
semantic structure and from the t correspondence
to I&apos;. However, despite its somewhat diminished
role with respect to modifiers, the z
correspondence is still important in controlling
the translation of simpler grammatical function

We have suggested in this paper that certain
problems of correspondence-based translation, in
particular the difficulty of adverb and verb
interchanges, are more properly considered the
result of defective monolingual analyses. We
have proposed a new description-language
operator, restriction, to permit a succinct formal
encoding of the informal intuition that semantic
units sometimes correspond to subsets of
functional information. This operator, in
conjunction with an additional recursion
provided by a description-by-analysis rule, is the
basis of a more adequate account of
head-switching phenomena.

Introduction Kaplan et al. (1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). LFG formulates the syntactic dependencies and generalizations of natural languages in terms of the properties of formal structures of different types: ordinary phrase-structure trees represent the surface constituency of sentences while hierarchical finite functions represent their underlying grammatical relations. The structures for a particular sentence are those that satisfy descriptions produced from annotated phrase-structure rules and lexical entries.

The adverbial examples above involve only single sentential adjuncts, but our analysis allows for any number of adverbs with all possible scope ambiguities, and it can easily be extended to handle VP modifiers as well. We start with a c-structure rule that assigns arbitrarily many adverbs to the set-value of the ADJ attribute, consistent with the original LFG account of adjuncts (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982): (17) S NP ADV* VP suB.o.J, E(t AD1) The sentence (18a) will be assigned the f-structure (18b) by virtue of this rule. Our goal is to associate with this f-structure the 198 alternative semantic structures in (19). We note that set-element restriction also has commutative and associative properties: (18) (a) John obviously just fell.

The restriction operator can encode the intuitively desirable constraints, but an additional recursive process is needed to generate those constraints. This recursion can arise from an explicit traversal of the f-structure in the style of Halvorsen&apos;s (1983) semantic interpretation procedure. It can also come from lexical expressions of inside-out functional uncertainty; this formal device was introduced by Kaplan (1988) and has been applied to problems of quantifier scope (Halvorsen and Kaplan, 1988) and anaphoric dependencies (Dalrymple, 1993).

In this paper we suggest that these difficulties are more properly considered as the result of defective monolingual analyses. We propose a new description-language operator, restriction, to permit a succinct formal encoding of the informal intuition that semantic units sometimes correspond to subsets of functional information. This operator, in conjunction with an additional recursion provided by a description-by-analysis rule, is the basis of a more adequate account of head-switching that preserves the advantages of correspondence-based translation. 1. Introduction Kaplan et al. (1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). LFG formulates the syntactic dependencies and generalizations of natural languages in terms of the properties of formal structures of different types: ordinary phrase-structure trees represent the surface constituency of sentences while hierarchical finite functions represent their underlying grammatical relations. The structures for a particular sentence are those that satisfy descriptions produced from annotated phrase-structure rules and lexical</context>

(1989) suggest that this architecture can provide a formal basis for specifying complex source-target translation relationships in a declarative fashion that builds on monolingual grammars and lexicons that are independently motivated and theoretically justified. In particular, the approach permits features from different linguistic levels to affect translation without requiring that reflexes of those disparate features appear together in an otherwise unmotivated transfer or interlingual representation. Kaplan et al. (1989) offer several examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach to translation. These examples involve changes in grammatical functions from source to target, differences in control, and differences in embedding (or head-switching). The Kaplan et al. solutions depend on monolingual representations of phrasal, functional, and semantic information related by the correspondences 4:1) and a, with translation 193 correspondences t and 1&apos; mapping source to target structures, as shown in the configuration in (1): (1) Source Target &amp;quot; semantic structure 0 / -c These solutions utilize the forma</context>

The expression -c can then be seen as T(4)(M(*))) = 4)(M(*)) and thus as incorporating the composition c 4). Significantly, the M(*) term is also present, which means that the target constraints are determined in the same recursive analysis of the source c-structure that is used to derive the source f-structure description.

They suggest refining the basic correspondence approach by separating such idiosyncratic source-target interactions into a separate transfer lexicon whose stipulations will override (perhaps via the priority union operator) the generic transfer specifications that might still be associated with the source-language predicates.
