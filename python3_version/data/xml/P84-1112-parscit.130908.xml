ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999905041666666">
It seems rather natural to admit that
language use is governed by rules that relate
signs, forms and meanings to possible intentions
or possible interpretations, in function of
utterance situations. Not less natural should seem
the idea that the meaning of a natural language
expression conveys enough material to the input of
these rules, so that, given the situation of
utterance, they determine the appropriate
interpretation. If this is correct, the semantic
description of a natural language expression
should output not only the &apos;informative content&apos;
of that expression, but also all sorts of
indications concerning the way this expression may
be used or interpreted. In particular, the
argumentative power of utterances is due
to argumentative indications conveyed by the
sentences uttered, indications that are not part
of their informative content . This paper
emphasizes the role of argumentation in language
and shows how it could be accounted for in a
formal Representation Semantics framework. An
&apos;example of an analysis is provided in order to
show the &amp;quot;system at work&amp;quot;.

I. ARGUMENTATION AND THE SEMANTIC PROGRAM.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991503">
A. What is linguistic in argumentation.
The theory of argumentation developped by
Jean-Claude Anscombre and Oswald Ducrot is an
attempt to describe some aspects of language that
have not been carefully studied yet, in spite of
their importance for linguistic theory, discourse
representation, as well as simulation of
understanding.
In their framework, utterances are seen to be
produded in order to argue for some particular
conclusions with a certain force, depending on the
situation of utterance. Thus, when I utter
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.812921">
(1) This is beautiful but expensive
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.936286450980392">
in front of a shop window and pointing to some
item, I present my utterance as a reason for not
buying this item, while if I say
(2) This is expensive but beautiful
*This work has been supported in part by a
contract with the Centre National de la Recherche
Scientifique (contrathn° 95.5122)
I am giving a reason to buy the iteml.
Note that after uttering(1), I can perfectly
walk into the store and buy the item : what is odd,
in normal situations is to say (1&apos;)
(1&apos;) This is beautiful but expensive, and
therefore, I will buy it.
Anscombre and Ducrot unburied the old
Aristotelician concept of topoi to describe the
movement from the utterance to the conclusion. They
take these topoi to be of the form :
(To) The more X is P, the more Y is Q.
where &apos;X is P&apos; is the idea expressed by the
original utterance, and &apos;Y is Q&apos; is the
argumentative orientation (the conclusion argued
for by producing the original utterance in the
particular situation in which it is uttered). In
Raccah 84, I have argued for the adequacy of a
slightly different form for the topoi, which takes
into account the epistemical relation of the
speaker to the premiss :
(T) The more evidence I have in favor of X being P
The more arguments I&apos;have in favor of Y
being Q.
Topoi of this kind are shown to avoid problems with
non-gradual properties and, I argue, are closer to
the intuition we have about the argumentative
process2.
The description of argumentative connectives
provides rules to select the argumentative
orientation of a compounded utterance in function
of the more basic utterances that they connect.
Thus, the analysis of (1), (1&apos;), and (2)
suggests the following description of the
argumentative aspects of but :
in any utterance of P but Q, the presence of
but
II am talking here of normal situations , where
expensiveness is a reason not to buy, while beauty
is a reason to buy
2The idea is that it is not the degree of P-ness of
X (when this means something) that makes Y (more or
less) Q, but the degree to which the speaker
believes X is P that entitles him (her) to believe
(more or less) that Y is Q.

- requires that the utterances of P and Q be
interpreted as oriented towards opposite
conclusions,
- indicates that the complex utterance is oriented
towards the conclusion towards which Q is
oriented.
Following the example of Ocean&apos;s -disposable-
razor, / think that when there is a common
property for all utterances of the same sentence,
there ought to be, in the description of the
sentence, some features that enable the utterance
description to state this common property of the
different utterances. In other words, at the
output of the sentence semantics level of
analysis, there ought to be something that should
be taken as input to the pragmatic level and will
enable it to formulate the argumentative
properties common to all utterances of the same
sentence. I call the study of this something
&amp;quot;pre-argumentative analysis&amp;quot;. The reason why I
talk of &amp;quot;disposable&amp;quot; razor is that it is through
utterance analysis that we discover the
interesting properties of sentences. So that we
need, for heuristic reasons, to use the pragmatic
analysis in order to know what kind of output we
want for the sentence analysis : we dispose of the
razor only after using it...
B. What is argumentative in semantics.
In spite of this slight methodological
incursion into pragmatics, my concern is for
sentence semantic analysis. I postulate a semantic
level of sentence analysis such that :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8180385">
- no information about the world or the speaker&apos;s
(or hearer&apos;s) beliefs are taken into account at
this level;
- all of the informative meaning carried by the
sentence can be represented at this level (in
particular, the logical information as well as the
conventional implicature ;
- the pre-argumentative aspects of the sentence
are described at this level;
- the representation of meaning and the
description of pre-argumentation are both
compositional ;
- information about the world and beliefs only
need to be added at the next level of analysis to
get full interpretations of the utterances of the
sentence.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.964155114754098">
Note that I do not claim that models of this kind
have any psychological reality, not even any
chance to be good candidates, as such, for
computer simulating of 4naerstanding. Thus my
claim of autonomy of semantics (including
pre-argumentation) towards pragmatics is neither
an ontological claim nor a claim of technical
efficiency, but rather an epistemic one. This way
of analyzing language aims at answering some
linguistic and methodological questions, and it is
as such that I wish it be tested for its
applicability to Artificial Intelligence.
Among the theories sharing these assumptions,
I would like to speak about what I
call Representation Semantics : a theory of
meaning representation for sentences, inspired by
Montague 73 for its formal aspects, but diverging
from it in its more fundamental issues.
Representation Semantics uses the tools developped
by Montague but, instead of aiming at describing
the meaning of a sentence, as a result of its
semantic analysis, it only pretends to give, as
its output, a representation of some aspects of
its meaning : partial models of the
presuppositional content,the informative content,
and the pre-argumentative content of the
sentence&apos;. I use Karttunen and Peters&apos;
conventional implicature framework2, as a
pre-selection of possible models for representing
the meaning of sentences. This is shown to avoid
the classical paradox of the
presupposition/entailment relationship3. Meaning
representations for sentences include
pre-argumentative features in such a way that,
given the situation and the adequate topoi, the
argumentation of an utterance -in that situation
and within the corresponding cultural frame- of
the sentence analyzed can be computed.
II. OUTLINE OF A THEORY OF MEANING
REPRESENTATION.
A. Ingredients.
A detailed presentation of the theory would
require a long and careful discussion of the
concepts involved in it (some of which have
already been discussed in Raccah 80, 82 and 83), a
justification of their raison d&apos;être and of their
articulation within the theory. However
interesting, these technical and foundational
aspects do not fit this paper (both for material
and strategical reasons). Nevertheless, I would
like to briefly sketch the great lines of the
analysis process suggested by the theory .
The following diagram should partially
illustrate this point.
1See Kamp 80, for the informative content ; Raccah
80 or 83 for the presuppositional and informative
contents and Bruxelles-Raccah 83 and Raccah 84 for
preliminary discussions about the
Rre-argumentative content.

Each sentence is given one (or more, if ambiguous)
analysis tree by the syntactic module. Each tree
is then &apos;decomposed&apos; into four formulae : one for
the presupposition, one for the asserted
informative content, one for conditions on
argumentation, and one for pre-argumentation. The
first two &apos;decompositions&apos; can be obtained by the
use of Karttunen and Peters&apos; method, inspired by
Montague&apos;s translation function2. They both lead
to the construction of a partial model, say one of
the smallest models satisfying PI for the
presupposition, and one of the smallest models
satisfying both PI and P2, for what is asserted.
An example of constructions of this kind is given
by Kamp&apos;s discourse representations (Kamp 80)
B. Yes, but what about argumentation ?
Conditions on argumentation are imposed mainly
by the use of connectives (like but, however,
even etc.). A semantic description of these
connectives states, among other things, the
relationship between the possible argumentatiye
orientations of the utterances connected&apos;.
Formulae expressing these conditions on
argumentation will only appear in sentences
containing this kind of connectives, since I
haven&apos;t found, as yet, simple sentences imposing
conditions on argumentation. The form of this kind
of formulae is shown in the discussion of the
example.
Pre-argumentation is a theorical construct
much harder to justify on empirical grounds than
anyone of the other threed. Its theoretical
justification, however, is easy to see : The topoi
apply to some semantic indications in order to
1 Please recall that this process is not intented
to be a model of how humans actually deal with
language nor a suggestion about how a computer
should be structured : it stems from an external
epistemic view of language.
2 See Montague 73, Karttunen and Peters 79, and
Raccah 80.
form argumentative orientations of utterances.
These indications cannot be equated with
the informative content of the sentence, for two
reasons :
(0 the same sentence, say &amp;quot;It is 8 o&apos;clock&amp;quot;, can
be used in an argumentation whose premiss is &apos;it
is late&apos;, as well as in an argumentation whose
premiss is &apos;it is early&apos;. We will have to take the
sentence &amp;quot;It is 8 o&apos;clock&amp;quot; to be
pre-argumentatively ambiguous, while
its informative content is not.
(ii) Adverbs of degree (rather, yery,
extremely,...) usualy do not modify the
argumentative orientation of utterances (while
they change the informative content of the
sentence uttered) : they indicate the force with
which the utterance, as it is presented, argues
for the orientation. For example, if I say &amp;quot;This
car is very expensive&amp;quot; as an argument for not
buying it, it is not the very-expensiveness of the
car that makes the argument, but its
expensiveness; what the use of &amp;quot;very&amp;quot; says is that
my arguments for not buying the car are stronger
because my evidence for its expensiveness is
stronger : in fact I even have enough evidence to
say that it is very expensive.
Formulae expressing the pre-argumentation
will also express the pre-argumentative value
ascribed to it by these indications. The form of
these formulae (which can certainly be improved)
iswhere c is a logical expression
(stanfil e
l&apos; for the pre-orientation) and is an
index standing for the pre-argumentative value.
III. AN EXAMPLE.
I will now show, in an example analysis of a
particular sentence, how the theory builds
descriptions of the different aspects of the
meaning, and how these descriptions are connected
to one another and to eventual pragmatic
information, in order to allow an interpretation
of the possible utterances of the sentence.
Suppose we want to analyse the sentence
&apos; This position, however, assumes the hypothesis
that any utterance of a complex sentence
containing an argumentative connective can be
considered as a complex utterance, i.e. an
utterance which can be decomposed into two
utterances linked with this connective. See
Bruxelles-Raccah 83 for a discussion of this
hypothesis.
4Fortunately, this kind of justifications do not
concern us here, but I realize that even the ugly
notion of informative content seems to have more
intuitive backup than this one : a story to be
continued...

pre-oriented towards whatever conclusion can be
infered from the present king of France being old,

Similarily, suppose that the analysis of (5):

used is not defined) and incomplete (for instance,
there should be an indication of conditions on the

If, in addition, we have a formal description
of but in accordance to what has been suggested in
section I, we account, in a compositional way, for
all of the four aspects of (3) which are examined
here : let us see this in some detail.

following
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99974875">
P1 (X but Y) : P1(x)AP1(Y)
P2 (X but Y) : P2(x)AP2(Y)

the second expression says that what is asserted

by X and what is asserted by Y ; the third
expression says that the topoi that can be
selected are those which are such that their
application to the respective pre-orientations of
X and Y leads to opposite formulae (i.e. such that
the argumentative orientations of the
corresponding utterances of X and Y are opposite);
the last expression says that the pre-orientation
of X but Y,is that of Y.
(5) leads to the following description of (3) :

<bodyText confidence="0.999969384615385">
which corresponds to the actual interpretations of
(3). In particular, this description correctly
predicts that, without further information about
the context of utterance, the pair of topoi that
are naturally selected to interpret (3) is (Ta,Tb)
rather than the other three possibilities
mentioned here. In fact, to elect (Ta,Tb&apos;) , we
would have to believe thaeh,eito like Jazz and to
wake up late in the morning are incompatible while
believing that people who play Jazz tend to wake
up late in the morning. If we wanted to select
(Ta&apos;,Tb) we would have to believe that to be wise
and to like Jazz are opposed : this is a possible

choice, and an utterance of (3) where these topoi
were forced by some additional contextual
information would be likely to shock some people
(including myself). Finally, if we wanted to
select (Ta&apos;,Tb&apos;) , we would have to believe that
to be wise and to wake up late in the morning are
opposed : another possible choice, that might have
more adepts than 4limma the last one.
The theory is still young ; its formal version is
even younger, and certainly very imperfect.
However, it is the only theory on the &amp;quot;market&amp;quot;
(and for that reason, the first one...) which
examines this aspect of semantics, and offers a
basis for a conception of a Natural Language
Processor that might &amp;quot;grasp the idea&amp;quot; expressed by
a text and not only retrieve pieces of
information.
A computer version of a small fragment of
French is now at study. The programming languages
used for this study are PROLOG and LISP. The
programming of syntax and of the informative
aspects of semantics follows the ideas of Friedman
and Warren 78 an479 and of Hobbs and Rosenschein
78. For the pre-argumentative aspects and topoi
rules, nothing had been done before and much
remains to be done...

A detailed presentation of the theory would require a long and careful discussion of the concepts involved in it (some of which have already been discussed in Raccah 80, 82 and 83), a of their d&apos;être of their articulation within the theory. However interesting, these technical and foundational aspects do not fit this paper (both for material and strategical reasons). Nevertheless, I would like to briefly sketch the great lines of the analysis process suggested by the theory . The following diagram should partially illustrate this point. Kamp 80, for the informative content ; Raccah 80 or 83 for the presuppositional and informative contents and Bruxelles-Raccah 83 and Raccah 84 for preliminary discussions about the Rre-argumentative content. and Peters 79. Raccah 82. 526 semantic analysis Creel PI RI represen /Ml\ tree2-1 trans- -4p2 tation M2 lation R2 S is a senten41 expresses what is presupposed P2 expresses what is asserted R1 expresses conditions on argumentation R2 expresses pre-argumentation MI is a model representing P1 M2 is a model representing P2. Each sentence is given one (or more, if ambiguous) analysis tree by the syntactic module. Each tree is then &apos;decomposed&apos; into four formulae : one for the presupposition, one for the asserted informative content, one for conditions on argumentation, and one for pre-argumentation. The first two &apos;decompositions&apos; can be obtained by the use of Karttunen and Peters&apos; method, inspired by translation They both lead to the construction of a partial model, say one of the smallest models satisfying PI for the presupposition, and one of the smallest models satisfying both PI and P2, for what is asserted. An example of constructions of this kind is given Kamp&apos;s discourse 80) but what about argumentation? Conditions on argumentation are imposed mainly the use of connectives (like but, however, even etc.). A semantic description of these connectives states, among other things, the relationship between the possible argumentatiye orientations of the utterances connected&apos;. Formulae expressing these conditions on argumentation will only appear in sentences containing this kind of connectives, since I haven&apos;t found, as yet, simple sentences imposing conditions on argumentation. The form of this kind of formulae is shown in the discussion of the example. Pre-argumentation is a theorical construct much harder to justify on empirical grounds than anyone of the other threed. Its theoretical justification, however, is easy to see : The topoi apply to some semantic indications in order to 1Please recall that this process is not intented to be a model of how humans actually deal with language nor a suggestion about how a computer should be structured : it stems from an external epistemic view of language. 2See Montague 73, Karttunen and Peters 79, and Raccah 80. form argumentative orientations of utterances. These indications cannot be equated with content the sentence, for two reasons : same sentence, say &amp;quot;It is 8 o&apos;clock&amp;quot;, can be used in an argumentation whose premiss is &apos;it is late&apos;, as well as in an argumentation whose is &apos;it is early&apos;. We will have to sentence &amp;quot;It is 8 o&apos;clock&amp;quot; to be pre-argumentatively ambiguous, while content not. Adverbs of degree yery, extremely,...)usualy do not modify the argumentative orientation of utterances (while they change the informative content of the sentence uttered) : they indicate the force with which the utterance, as it is presented, argues for the orientation. For example, if I say &amp;quot;This car is very expensive&amp;quot; as an argument for not it, it is not the very-expensivenessof the car that makes the argument, but its expensiveness;what the use of &amp;quot;very&amp;quot; is that my arguments for not buying the car are stronger because my evidence for its expensiveness is stronger : in fact I even have enough evidence to that it is veryexpensive. Formulae expressing the pre-argumentation will also express the pre-argumentative value ascribed to it by these indications. The form of these formulae (which can certainly be improved) iswhere c is a logical expression (stanfil e for the pre-orientation) and is an index standing for the pre-argumentative value. III. AN EXAMPLE. will now show, in an example particular sentence, how the theory builds different aspects of the meaning, and how these descriptions are connected to one another and to eventual pragmatic in order to allow of the possible utterances of the sentence. want to sentence &apos; This position, however, assumes the hypothesis of a complex sentence containing an argumentative connective can be considered as a complex utterance, i.e. an utterance which can be decomposed into two utterances linked with this connective. See Bruxelles-Raccah 83 for a discussion of this hypothesis. 4Fortunately, this kind of justifications do not us I realize that even the ugly of content to have more intuitive backup than this one : a story to be continued... 527 (3) The present king of France is very old but he plays Jazz. in a cultural context where it is believed that a) old people tend not to like Jazz, and b) people who play Jazz tend to like it. Note that there are very many other things believed about old people, such as (a&apos;) (a&apos;) old people tend to be wise, and many other things believed about people who play Jazz, such as (b&apos;) (b&apos;) people who play Jazz tend to wake up late in the morning. We will take the topos expressing (a) to be the rule : for old, like and for and the topos expressing be the rule (Tb) i,x)h P stands for play. Suppose now that the analysis of (4) (4) The present king of France is very old gives the following four formulae : 310/1 P2(4) : [V(0))(91K(M R1(4) : : I where K,V69 mean &amp;quot;present king of France&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;very old&amp;quot;, 71c P(x) means &amp;quot;the unique x such that (W.&apos; , 1 is truth. P1(4) says that (4) presupposes that there is a unique entity which is the present king of France ; P2(4) says that (4) asserts that this entity is very old ; R1(4) says that (4) imposes no conditions on argumentation ; and R2(4) says that (4) is pre-oriented towards whatever conclusion can be infered from the present king of France being old, and that the conclusion will obtain with a force. Similarily, suppose that the analysis of (5): 1This is terribly sloppy (the symbolic language used is not defined) and incomplete (for instance, there should be an indication of conditions on the application of the topos), but it doesn&apos;t affect my purpose. (5) He (the present king of France) plays Jazz gives the following four formulae : P1(5) : 37L71 : R1(5) R2(5) with similar interpretation. If, in addition, we have a formal description of but in accordance to what has been suggested in section I, we account, in a compositional way, for all of the four aspects of (3) which are examined here : let us see this in some detail. The formal description of but is the following P1 (X but Y) : P1(x)AP1(Y) P2 (X but Y) : P2(x)AP2(Y) R1 (X but Y) : Topos/R2 (Y) = ew Topos/R2 (x) R2 (X but Y) : R2(Y) Where the first expression says that what is by but Yis the conjunction of what is presupposed by X and what is presupposed by Y ; the second expression says that what is asserted but Yis the conjunction of what is asserted by X and what is asserted by Y ; the third expression says that the topoi that can be selected are those which are such that their application to the respective pre-orientations of X and Y leads to opposite formulae (i.e. such that the argumentative orientations of the corresponding utterances of X and Y are opposite); the last expression says that the pre-orientation but that of Y. (5) leads to the following description of (3) : Applying this description of but to (4) and : : v(0)) k( (3) : Toms/0(11 Xki)) : P(i,71 which corresponds to the actual interpretations of (3). In particular, this description correctly predicts that, without further information about the context of utterance, the pair of topoi that are naturally selected to interpret (3) is (Ta,Tb) rather than the other three possibilities mentioned here. In fact, to elect (Ta,Tb&apos;) , we have to believe like Jazz and to wake up late in the morning are incompatible while believing that people who play Jazz tend to wake up late in the morning. If we wanted to select (Ta&apos;,Tb) we would have to believe that to be wise and to like Jazz are opposed : this is a possible 528 choice, and an utterance of (3) where these topoi were forced by some additional contextual information would be likely to shock some people (including myself). Finally, if we wanted to select (Ta&apos;,Tb&apos;) , we would have to believe that to be wise and to wake up late in the morning are opposed : another possible choice, that might have adepts than last one. The theory is still young ; its formal version is even younger, and certainly very imperfect. However, it is the only theory on the &amp;quot;market&amp;quot; (and for that reason, the first one...) which examines this aspect of semantics, and offers a basis for a conception of a Natural Language Processor that might &amp;quot;grasp the idea&amp;quot; expressed by a text and not only retrieve pieces of information. A computer version of a small fragment of French is now at study. The programming languages used for this study are PROLOG and LISP. The programming of syntax and of the informative aspects of semantics follows the ideas of Friedman and Warren 78 an479 and of Hobbs and Rosenschein 78. For the pre-argumentative aspects and topoi rules, nothing had been done before and much remains to be done...</abstract>
