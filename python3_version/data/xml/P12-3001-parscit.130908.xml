<bodyText confidence="0.99999512">
We demonstrate applications of psycholin-
guistic and sublexical information for learn-
ing Chinese characters. The knowledge
about the grapheme-phoneme conversion
(GPC) rules of languages has been shown to
be highly correlated to the ability of reading
alphabetic languages and Chinese. We build
and will demo a game platform for
strengthening the association of phonologi-
cal components in Chinese characters with
the pronunciations of the characters. Results
of a preliminary evaluation of our games
indicated significant improvement in learn-
ers’ response times in Chinese naming
tasks. In addition, we construct a Web-
based open system for teachers to prepare
their own games to best meet their teaching
goals. Techniques for decomposing Chinese
characters and for comparing the similarity
between Chinese characters were employed
to recommend lists of Chinese characters
for authoring the games. Evaluation of the
authoring environment with 20 subjects
showed that our system made the authoring
of games more effective and efficient.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999802411764706">
Learning to read and write Chinese characters is a
challenging task for learners of Chinese. To read
everyday news articles, one needs to learn thou-
sands of Chinese characters. The official agents in
Taiwan and China, respectively, chose 5401 and
3755 characters as important basic characters in
national standards. Consequently, the general pub-
lic has gained the impression that it is not easy to
read Chinese articles, because each of these thou-
sands of characters is written in different ways.
Teachers adopt various strategies to help learn-
ers to memorize Chinese characters. An instructor
at the University of Michigan made up stories
based on decomposed characters to help students
remember their formations (Tao, 2007). Some take
linguistics-based approaches. Pictogram is a major
formation of Chinese characters, and radicals carry
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999778468085107">
partial semantic information about Chinese charac-
ters. Hence, one may use radicals as hints to link
the meanings and writings of Chinese characters.
For instance, “河”(he2, river) [Note: Chinese char-
acters will be followed by their pronunciations,
denoted in Hanyu pinyin, and, when necessary, an
English translation.], “海”(hai3, sea), and
“洋”(yang2, ocean) are related to huge water sys-
tems, so they share the semantic radical, 氵, which
is a pictogram for “water” in Chinese. Applying
the concepts of pictograms, researchers designed
games, e.g., (Lan et al., 2009) and animations, e.g.,
(Lu, 2011) for learning Chinese characters.
The aforementioned approaches and designs
mainly employ visual stimuli in activities. We re-
port exploration of using the combination of audio
and visual stimuli. In addition to pictograms, more
than 80% of Chinese characters are phono-
semantic characters (PSCs, henceforth) (Ho and
Bryant, 1997). A PSC consists of a phonological
component (PC, henceforth) and a semantic com-
ponent. Typically, the semantic components are the
radicals of PSCs. For instance, “讀”(du2),
“i”(du2), “犢” (du2), “牘”(du2) contain different
radicals, but they share the same phonological
components, “賣”(mai4), on their right sides. Due
to the shared PC, these four characters are pro-
nounced in exactly the same way. If a learner can
learn and apply this rule, one may guess and read
“黷”(du2) correctly easily.
In the above example, “賣” is a normal Chinese
character, but not all Chinese PCs are standalone
characters. The characters “檢”(jian3), “撿”
(jian3), and “儉”(jian3) share their PCs on their
right sides, but that PC is not a standalone Chinese
character. In addition, when a PC is a standalone
character, it might not indicate its own or similar
pronunciation when it serves as a PC in the hosting
character, e.g., “賣” and “讀” are pronounced as
/mai4/ and /du2/, respectively. In contrast, the pro-
nunciations of “匋”, “ij”, “陶”, and “啕” are
/tao2/.
Pronunciations of specific substrings in words of
alphabetic languages are governed by grapheme-
phoneme conversion (GPC) rules, though not all
languages have very strict GPC rules. The GPC
rules in English are not as strict as those in Finish

(Ziegler and Goswami, 2005), for instance. The
substring “ean” are pronounced consistently in
“bean”, “clean”, and “dean,” but the substring “ch”
does not have a consistent pronunciation in
“school”, “chase”, and “machine.” PCs in Chinese
do not follow strict GPC rules either, but they re-
main to be good agents for learning to read.
Despite the differences among phoneme systems
and among the degrees of strictness of the GPC
rules in different languages, ample psycholinguis-
tic evidences have shown that phonological aware-
ness is a crucial factor in predicting students’ read-
ing ability, e.g., (Siok and Fletcher, 2001). Moreo-
ver, the ability to detect and apply phonological
consistency in GPCs, including the roles of PCs in
PSCs in Chinese, plays an instrumental role in
learners’ competence in reading Chinese. Phono-
logical consistency is an important concept for
learners of various alphabetic languages (Jared et
al., 1990; Ziegler and Goswami, 2005) and of Chi-
nese, e.g., (Lee et al., 2005), and is important for
both young readers (Ho and Bryant, 1997; Lee,
2009) and adult readers (Lin and Collins, 2012).
This demonstration is unique on two aspects: (1)
students play games that are designed to strengthen
the association between Chinese PCs and the pro-
nunciations of hosting characters and (2) teachers
compile the games with tools that are supported by
sublexical information in Chinese. The games aim
at implicitly informing players of the Chinese GPC
rules, mimicking the process of how infants would
apply statistical learning (Saffran et al., 1996). We
evaluated the effectiveness of the game platform
with 116 students between grade 1 and grade 6 in
Taiwan, and found that the students made progress
in the Chinese naming tasks.
As we will show, it is not trivial to author games
for learning a GPC rule to meet individualized
teaching goals. For this reason, techniques reported
in a previous ACL conference for decomposing
and comparing Chinese characters were employed
to assist the preparation of games (Liu et al., 2011).
Results of our evaluation showed that the author-
ing tool facilitates the authoring process, improv-
ing both efficiency and effectiveness.
We describe the learning games in Section 2,
and report the evaluation results of the games in
Section 3. The authoring tool is presented in Sec-
tion 4, and its evaluation is discussed in Section 5.
We provide some concluding remarks in Section 6.

most relevant to the demonstration.
Figure 1 shows a screenshot when a player is
playing the game. This is a game of “whac-a-
mole” style. The target PC appears in the upper
middle of the window (“里”(li3) in this example),
and a character and an accompanying monster (one
at a time) will pop up randomly from any of the six
holes on the ground. The player will hear the pro-
nunciation of the character (i.e., “裡”(li3)), such
that the player receives both audio and visual stim-
uli during a game. Players’ task is to hit the mon-
sters for the characters that contain the shown PC.
The box at the upper left corner shows the current
credit (i.e., 3120) of the player. The player’s credit
will be increased or decreased if s/he hits a correct
or an incorrect character, respectively. If the player
does not hit, the credit will remain the same. Play-
ers are ranked, in the Hall of Fame, according to
their total credits to provide an incentive for them
to play the game after school.
In Figure 1, the player has to hit the monster be-
fore the monster disappears to get the credit. If the
player does not act in time, the credit will not
change.
On ordinary computers, the player manipulates
the mouse to hit the monster. On multi-touch tablet
computers, the play can just touch the monsters
with fingers. Both systems will be demoed.

2.1 Challenging Levels
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958478260869">
At the time of logging into the game, players can
choose two parameters: (1) class level: lower class
(i.e., grades 1 and 2), middle class (i.e., grades 3
and 4), or upper class (i.e., grades 5 and 6) and (2)
speed level: the duration between the monsters’
popping up and going down. The characters for
lower, middle, and upper classes vary in terms of
frequency and complexity of the characters. A stu-
dent can choose the upper class only if s/he is in
the upper class or if s/he has gathered sufficient
credits. There are three different speeds for the
monsters to appear and hide: 2, 3, and 5 seconds.
Choosing different combinations of these two pa-
components such
as the manage-
ment of players’
accounts and the
maintenance of
players’ learning

2.2 Feedback Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999891512820513">
After finishing a
game, the player
receives feed-
back about the
correct and in-
correct actions
that were taken
during the game.
Figure 2 shows
such an example.
The feedback informs the players what characters
were correctly hit (“fllt”(mai2), “理”(li3),
“裡”(li3), and “鯉”(li3)), incorrectly hit
(“婷”(ting2) and “袖”(show4)), and should have
been hit (“狸”(li2)). When the player moves mouse
over these characters, a sample Chinese word that
shows how the character is used in daily lives will
show up in a vertical box near the middle (i.e.,
“裡面”(li3 mian4)).
The main purpose of providing the feedback in-
formation is to allow players a chance to reflect on
what s/he had done during the game, thereby
strengthening the learning effects.
On the upper right hand side of Figure 2 are four
tabs for more functions. Clicking on the top tab
(繼續玩) will take the player to the next game. In
the next game, the focus will switch to a different
PC. The selection of the next PC is random in the
current system, but we plan to make the switching
from a game to another adaptive to the students’
performance in future systems. Clicking on the
second tab (看排W) will see the player list in the
Hall of Fame, clicking on the third tab
(AQ主選單) will return to the main menu, and
clicking on the fourth (ho分題) will lead to games
for extra credits. We have extended our games to
lead students to learning Chinese words from char-
acters, and details will be illustrated during the
demo.

The data structure of a game is simple. When com-
piling a game, a teacher selects the PC for the
game, and prepares six characters that contain the
PC (to be referred as an In-list henceforth) and
four characters as distracter characters that do not
contain the PC (to be referred as an Out-list hence-
forth). The simplest internal form of a game looks
like {target PC= “X”, In-list= “裡理鯉浬哩鋰”,
Out-list= “t鰓嘿鉀” }. We can convert this struc-
ture into a game easily. Through this simple struc-
ture, teachers choose the PCs to teach with charac-
ter combinations of different challenging levels.
During the process of playing, our system ran-
domly selects one character from the list of 10
characters. In a game, 10 characters will be pre-
sented to the player.

3.1 Procedure and Participants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978731259259259">
The evaluation was conducted at an elementary
school in Taipei, Taiwan, during the winter break
between late January and the end of February
2011. The lunar new year of 2011 happened to be
within this period.
Students were divided into an experimental
group and a control group. We taught students of
the experimental group and showed them how to
play the games in class hours before the break be-
gan. The experimental group had one month of
time to play the games, but there were no rules
asking the participants how much time they must
spend on the games. Instead, they were told that
they would be rewarded if they were ranked high
in the Hall of Fame. Table 2 shows the numbers of
participants and their actual class levels.
As we explained in Section 2.1, a player could
choose the class level before the game begins.
Hence, for example, it is possible for a lower class
player to play the games designed for middle or
even upper class levels to increase their credits
faster. However, if the player is not competent, the
credits may be deducted faster as well. In the eval-
uation, 20 PCs were used in the games for each
class level in Table 1.
Pretests and posttests were administered with the

Table 3 shows the statistics for the control group.
After the one month evaluation period, the perfor-
mance of the control group did not change signifi-
cantly, except participants in the upper class. This
subgroup improved their speeds in RAN. (Statisti-
cally significant numbers are highlighted.)
Table 4 shows the statistics for the experimental
group. After the evaluation period, the speeds in
RAN of all class levels improved significantly.
The correct rates in RAN of the control group
did not improve or fall, though not statistically sig-
nificant. In contrast, the correct rates in RAN of
the experimental group improved, but the im-
provement was not statistically significant either.
The statistics for the CCRT tests were not statis-
tically significant. The only exception is that the
middle class in the experimental group achieved
better CCRT results. We were disappointed in the
falling of the performance in CCRT of the lower
class, though the change was not significant. The
lower class students were very young, so we con-
jectured that it was harder for them to remember
the writing of Jhuyin symbols after the winter
break. Hence, after the evaluation, we strengthened
the feedback by adding Jhuyin information. In Fig-
ure 2, the Jhuyin information is now added beside
the sample Chinese words, i.e., “#ffa” (li3 mian4).

4 An Open Authoring Tool for the Games
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980380952381">
Our game platform has attracted the attention of
teachers of several elementary schools. To meet
the teaching goals of teacher in different areas, we
have to allow the teachers to compile their own
games for their needs.
The data structure for a game, as we explained
in Section 2.3, is not complex. A teacher needs to
determine the PC to be taught first, then s/he must
choose an In-list and an Out-list. In the current im-
plementation, we choose to have six characters in
the In-list and four characters in the Out-list. We
allow repeated characters when the qualified char-
acters are not enough.
This authoring process is far less trivial as it
might seem to be. In a previous evaluation, even
native speakers of Chinese found it challenging to
list many qualified characters out of the sky. Be-
cause PCs are not radicals, ordinary dictionaries
would not help very much. For instance, “fft”
(mai2), “V_”(li2), “#”(li3), and “,”(li3) belong
to different radicals and have different pronuncia-
tions, so there is no simple way to find them at just
one place.
Identifying characters for the In-list of a PC is
not easy, and finding the characters for the Out-list
is even more challenging. In Figure 1, “X” (li3) is
the PC to teach in the game. Without considering
the characters in In-list for the game, we might
believe that “T” (jia3) and “I” (cheng2) look
equally similar to “X”, so both are good distract-
ers. If, assuming that “31”(li3) is in the In-list,
“JT” (jia3) will be a better distracter than “A”
(cheng2) for the Out-list, because “JT” and “31”
are more similar in appearance. By contrast, if we
have “#” in the In-list, we may prefer to having
“.*” (cheng2) than having “JT” in the Out-list.
Namely, given a PC to teach and a selected In-
list, the “quality” of the Out-list is dependent on
the characters in In-list. Out-lists of high quality
influence the challenging levels of the games, and
will become a crucial ingredient when we make the
games adaptive to players’ competence.

In a realistic teaching situation, a teacher will be
teaching new characters and would like to provide
students games that are related to the structures of
the new characters. Hence, it is most convenient
for the teachers that our tool decomposes a given
character and recommends the PC in the character.
For instance, given “理”, we show the teacher that
we could compile a game for “里”. This is achiev-
able using the techniques that we illustrate in the
next subsection.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995778">
4.2 Character Recommendation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999746">
Given a selected PC, a teacher has to prepare the
In-list and Out-list for the game. Extending the
techniques we reported in (Liu et al., 2011), we
decompose every Chinese character into a se-
quence of detailed Cangjie codes, which allows us
to infer the PC contained in a character and to infer
the similarity between two Chinese characters.
For instance, the internal codes for “里”, “理”,
“裡”, and “玾” are, respectively, “WG”,
“MGWG”, “LWG”, and “MGWL”. The English
letters denote the basic elements of Chinese char-
acters. For instance, “WG” stands for “田土”,
which are the upper and the lower parts of “里”,
“WL” stands for “田中”, which could be used to
rebuild “甲” in a sense. By comparing the internal
codes of Chinese characters, it is possible to find
that (1) “理” and “裡” include “里” and that (2)
“理” and “玾” are visually similar based on the
overlapping codes.
For the example problem that we showed in
Figures 1 and 2, we may apply an extended proce-
dure of (Liu et al., 2011) to find an In-list for “里”:
“鋰裡浬狸埋理娌哩俚”. This list includes more
characters than most native speakers can produce
for “里” within a short period. Similar to what we
reported previously, it is not easy to find a perfect
list of characters. More specifically, it was relative-
ly easy to achieve high recall rates, but the preci-
sion rates varied among different PCs. However,
with a good scoring function to rank the characters,
it is not hard to achieve quality recommendations
by placing the characters that actually contain the
target PCs on top of the recommendation.
Given that “里” is the target PC and the above
In-list, we can recommend characters that look like
the correct characters, e.g., “鈿鉀鍾” for “鋰”,
嘿” for “裡 “湮湩渭&amp;quot; for “浬”,
“狎猥狠狙” ”.
for “狸” , and “黑墨&amp;quot; for “ 里
We employed similar techniques to recommend
characters for In-lists and Out-lists. The database
that contains information about the decomposed
Chinese charac-
ters was the
same, but we
utilized different
object functions
in selecting and
ranking the
characters. We
considered all
elements in a
character to rec-
ommend charac-
ters for In-lists, but focused on the inclusion of
target PCs in the decomposed characters to rec-
ommend characters for Out-lists. Again our rec-
ommendations for the Out-lists were not perfect,
and different ranking functions affect the perceived
usefulness of the authoring tools.
Figure 3 shows the step to choose characters in
the Out-list for characters in the In-list. In this ex-
ample, six characters for the In-list for the PC “ ”
had been chosen, and were listed near the top:
“搖遙謠瑤鷂搖”. Teachers can find characters
that are similar to these six correct characters in
separate pull-down lists. The screenshot shows the
operation to choose a character that is similar to
“遙” (yao2) from the pull-down list. The selected
character would be added into the Out-list.

judged by psycholinguists who have experience in
teaching. The highest possible scores for the In-list
and the Out-list were both 30 for a game.

Table 5 shows the results of the evaluation. The
experimental group outperformed the control
group in both the quality of the games and in the
time spent on the authoring task. The differences
are clearly statistically significant.
Table 6 shows the scores for the In-list and Out-
list achieved by the control and the experimental
groups. Using the authoring tools helped the evalu-
ators to achieved significantly higher scores for the
Out-list. Indeed, it is not easy to find characters
that (1) are similar to the characters in the In-list
and (2) cannot contain the target PC.
Due to the page limits, we could not present the
complete authoring system, but hope to have the
chance to show it during the demonstration.

6 Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983954545454">
We reported a game for strengthening the associa-
tion of the phonetic components and the pronun-
ciations of Chinese characters. Experimental re-
sults indicated that playing the games helped stu-
dents shorten the response times in naming tasks.
To make our platform more useable, we built an
authoring tool so that teachers could prepare games
that meet specific teaching goals. Evaluation of the
tool with college and graduate students showed
that our system offered an efficient and effective
environment for this authoring task.
Currently, players of our games still have to
choose challenge levels. In the near future, we
wish to make the game adaptive to players’ compe-
tence by adopting more advanced techniques, in-
cluding the introduction of “consistency values”
(Jared et al., 1990). Evidence shows that foreign
students did not take advantage of the GPC rules in
Chinese to learn Chinese characters (Shen, 2005).
Hence, it should be interesting to evaluate our sys-
tem with foreign students to see whether our ap-
proach remains effective.

<abstract confidence="0.999363115384615">We demonstrate applications of psycholinguistic and sublexical information for learning Chinese characters. The knowledge about the grapheme-phoneme conversion (GPC) rules of languages has been shown to be highly correlated to the ability of reading alphabetic languages and Chinese. We build and will demo a game platform for strengthening the association of phonological components in Chinese characters with the pronunciations of the characters. Results of a preliminary evaluation of our games indicated significant improvement in learners’ response times in Chinese naming tasks. In addition, we construct a Webbased open system for teachers to prepare their own games to best meet their teaching goals. Techniques for decomposing Chinese characters and for comparing the similarity between Chinese characters were employed to recommend lists of Chinese characters for authoring the games. Evaluation of the authoring environment with 20 subjects showed that our system made the authoring of games more effective and efficient.</abstract>

For instance, “讀”(du2), “i”(du2), “犢” (du2), “牘”(du2) contain different radicals, but they share the same phonological components, “賣”(mai4), on their right sides. Due to the shared PC, these four characters are pronounced in exactly the same way. If a learner can learn and apply this rule, one may guess and read “黷”(du2) correctly easily.

Hence, it is most convenient for the teachers that our tool decomposes a given character and recommends the PC in the character. For instance, given “理”, we show the teacher that we could compile a game for “里”. This is achievable using the techniques that we illustrate in the next subsection. 4.2 Character Recommendation Given a selected PC, a teacher has to prepare the In-list and Out-list for the game. Extending the techniques we reported in (Liu et al., 2011), we decompose every Chinese character into a sequence of detailed Cangjie codes, which allows us to infer the PC contained in a character and to infer the similarity between two Chinese characters. For instance, the internal codes for “里”, “理”, “裡”, and “玾” are, respectively, “WG”, “MGWG”, “LWG”, and “MGWL”. The English letters denote the basic elements of Chinese characters. For instance, “WG” stands for “田土”, which are the upper and the lower parts of “里”, “WL” stands for “田中”, which could be used to rebuild “甲” in a sense.

The substring “ean” are pronounced consistently in “bean”, “clean”, and “dean,” but the substring “ch” does not have a consistent pronunciation in “school”, “chase”, and “machine.” PCs in Chinese do not follow strict GPC rules either, but they remain to be good agents for learning to read. Despite the differences among phoneme systems and among the degrees of strictness of the GPC rules in different languages, ample psycholinguistic evidences have shown that phonological awareness is a crucial factor in predicting students’ reading ability, e.g., (Siok and Fletcher, 2001). Moreover, the ability to detect and apply phonological consistency in GPCs, including the roles of PCs in PSCs in Chinese, plays an instrumental role in learners’ competence in reading Chinese. Phonological consistency is an important concept for learners of various alphabetic languages (Jared et al., 1990; Ziegler and Goswami, 2005) and of Chinese, e.g., (Lee et al., 2005), and is important for both young readers (Ho and Bryant, 1997; Lee, 2009) and adult readers (Lin and Collins, 2012).

The official agents in Taiwan and China, respectively, chose 5401 and 3755 characters as important basic characters in national standards. Consequently, the general public has gained the impression that it is not easy to read Chinese articles, because each of these thousands of characters is written in different ways. Teachers adopt various strategies to help learners to memorize Chinese characters. An instructor at the University of Michigan made up stories based on decomposed characters to help students remember their formations (Tao, 2007). Some take linguistics-based approaches. Pictogram is a major formation of Chinese characters, and radicals carry 1 partial semantic information about Chinese characters. Hence, one may use radicals as hints to link the meanings and writings of Chinese characters. For instance, “河”(he2, river) [Note: Chinese characters will be followed by their pronunciations, denoted in Hanyu pinyin, and, when necessary, an English translation.], “海”(hai3, sea), and “洋”(yang2, ocean) are related to huge water systems, so they share the semantic radical, 氵, which is a pictogram for “water” in Chinese.
