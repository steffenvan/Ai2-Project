It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the 2010 Human Language Technologies conference of
the North American chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics. An enormous amount
of effort has gone into organizing the conference, and the result is the rich set of intellectual and social
experiences that you will enjoy this week.
The NAACL HLT 2010 conference is an orchestrated production of many events. The centerpiece is
the collection of carefully chosen papers, posters, and demonstrations that will be presented during
the three days of the main conference. This includes the papers and posters of the Student Research
Workshop, a setting that gives encouragement and opportunity for new members of our community to
present their work. The main conference is preceded by a day of tutorials on topics of current interest
in the field, and it is followed by a very full program of specialized workshops.
Many people have volunteered their time and energy to ensure the success of the conference. Indeed,
the community as a whole has contributed by submitting papers and proposals for workshops, demos,
and tutorials, by making thoughtful judgments as members of the many review committees, and for
coming to participate in the events this week. These contributions are very much appreciated. The
heaviest burdens have been shared by the people who agreed to lead the major subcommittees of the
conference, and I want to recognize them here and explicitly thank them for their service.
To begin, I want to express my gratitude to Jill Burstein, Mary Harper, and Gerald Penn, the co-
Chairs of the Program Committee. They supervised the selection of papers and scheduling for the main
conference, recruiting the Area Chairs and managing the overall process. They chose the Noisy Genre
theme of the conference, collaborated with the Area Chairs to select the Invited Speakers, administered
the START reviewing system, and worked with the Area Chairs and the Local Arrangements Committee
to assemble the final program. They also added a new feature to the program, a ”one-minute madness”
session to raise awareness and excitement about the poster and demo presentations.
The Program Committee co-Chairs and Area Chairs recommended a small number of papers for further
consideration by the Best Papers Committee, chaired by Aravind Joshi. Tremendous thanks go to
Aravind, Eugene Charniak, Michael Collins, Diane Litman, Daniel Marcu, and Drago Radev for their
work in identifying the best examples of current work in the field.
The main-conference days include some other important activities. I appreciate Kristina Toutanova’s
effort to organize a second lunch-time Industry Panel, a follow-on to the successful panel at NAACL
HLT 2009. I thank Carolyn Penstein Ros´e, Chair of the Demonstration Committee, for soliciting
candidates for the Demo Session and overseeing the rigorous process of review. For organizing the
Student Research Workshop I thank Adriane Boyd, Mahesh Joshi, and Frank Rudzicz, the student co-
Chairs, and also Julia Hockenmaier and Diane Litman for the assistance and guidance they provided
as Faculty Advisors. Financial support for the student workshop came from a grant from the National
Science Foundation.
I thank Richard Sproat and David Traum for serving as co-Chairs of the Workshop Committee. The
workshop proposal and selection process was a joint activity of committees representing all three of
this year’s computational linguistics conferences, the ACL conference in Uppsala, Coling in Beijing,
and NAACL HLT. Their challenge was to honor the location requests of the workshop proposers while
iii
arranging for each conference to have a broad and balanced collection of workshops. A full complement
of 16 workshops were chosen for NAACL HLT, and Richard and David then became the interface
with the organizers of the individual workshops as they put out their calls, reviewed submissions, and
assembled final papers for the Publications Committee.
I am grateful to Jason Baldridge, Peter Clark, and Gokhan Tur for volunteering to co-Chair the Tutorial
Committee and for attracting and selecting tutorials that introduce a range of novel techniques and
address a number of theoretical and practical problems.
The Publications Committee is responsible for constructing the written Proceedings of the conference
from the materials that come from the many sources. The Publications Committee, with Claudia
Leacock and Richard Wicentowski as co-Chairs, comes in at the end of the preparation stage and
must operate on a strict schedule if the Proceedings are to be available by the time the conference
begins. This year Claudia and Richard have been the pioneers for two major departures from past
procedure. ACL proceedings in the past have been produced by a stand-alone community-developed
software package, ACLPUB; this year we are using a version of that package that has been integrated
directly into the START conference-management system. This should simplify the publication process
for future conferences, but Claudia and Richard endured a fair amount of first-user suffering. The
second departure from past practices is that for the first time we are providing the proceedings only on
a USB memory stick, unaccompanied by a hardcopy volume. I deeply appreciate the care and attention
with which Claudia and Richard have carried out their responsibilities.
We are all very much indebted to David Chiang, Jason Riesa, Jonathan May, and Eduard Hovy, the
co-Chairs of the Local Arrangements Committee, and to the other members of the committee from the
USC Information Sciences Institute. They have been hard at work for the longest time, and the comfort
and elegance of the conference setting is the result of the many decisions they have made. To highlight
just a few, they selected the hotel, made sure that the session rooms are properly laid out and equipped,
and planned for the reception and banquet. They also designed and maintained the very attractive and
informative conference web site. Liang Huang served as Coordinator of the Student Volunteers, and
Jillian Gerten and Kenji Sagae served as Exhibit Coordinators.
I am grateful to the sponsoring organizations listed above for their financial support of the conference,
and to the members of the Sponsorship Committee for identifying and nurturing those important
relationships. The Sponsorship Committee–Srinivas Bangalore, Christy Doran, Eduard Hovy, Stephen
Pulman, and Fr´ed´erique Segond–raised money jointly for NAACL HLT and ACL this year.
The NAACL executive committee, chaired by Owen Rambow and Rebecca Hwa, provides overall
supervision and maintains the continuity and traditions of the conference from year to year. They
helped by identifying candidates for many of the committee positions, by resolving several significant
issues of conference policy, and by overseeing the budgeting process.
Finally, my heartfelt thanks go to Priscilla Rasmussen, the Business Manager of the ACL office and
for the ACL conferences, for her steady guidance through all the stages of conference preparation.
Priscilla, as always, played a critical role as the voice of experience and the source of wise advice that
kept everything moving in the right direction.

Thanks for attending NAACL HLT 2010! As can be seen in the Conference Program, the
NAACL HLT program contains innovative, high-quality work spanning a large array of disciplines
within computational linguistics and human language technology. This year, we have included a special
Noisy Genre theme to acknowledge the significant work in that area across several disciplines. We
would like to thank L.Venkata Subramaniam of IBM Research-India for this suggestion.
NAACL HLT 2010 consists of oral and poster presentations of full and short papers, tutorials,
application demonstrations, and workshops. A one-minute madness session has been introduced this
year to highlight the poster and demo contributions. We are excited to have two very interesting and
diverse keynote speakers: David Temperley, University of Rochester, whose talk is entitled, “Music,
Language, and Computational Modeling: Lessons from the Key-Finding Problem”, and Steve Renals,
University of Edinburgh, “Recognition and Understanding of Meetings.” In addition, we have a panel
session Recent and Future HLT Challenges in Industry, chaired by Kristina Toutanova, which very
appropriately reflects the conference theme.
This year, 291 full papers were submitted and reviewed, of which 90 papers were accepted (a 30.9%
acceptance rate); 159 short papers were submitted and reviewed, of which 56 were accepted (a 35.2%
acceptance rate). One of the accepted short papers was withdrawn to appear elsewhere, leaving a total
of 55 short papers in the proceedings. Eighty-six full papers and 25 short papers will be presented
orally. The remaining 34 accepted full and short papers will be presented as posters. We would like to
thank all of the authors for submitting such remarkable papers to the conference.
Two best papers have been selected this year, and will be presented at the conference in a special
awards session. The Best Full Paper, entitled Coreference Resolution in a Modular, Entity-Centered
Model, was written by Aria Haghighi and Dan Klein. The Best Short Paper, entitled “cba to check
the spelling”: Investigating Parser Performance on Discussion Forum Posts, was written by Jennifer
Foster. Congratulations to the authors! The selection process worked as follows. The Senior Program
Committee (SPC) nominated an initial set of best paper candidates for the awards; the final decisions
were then made by a separate committee: Aravind Joshi (chair), Eugene Charniak, Michael Collins,
Diane Litman, Daniel Marcu, and Dragomir Radev. We would like to thank the committee for reading,
discussing, and contributing to the final selection process. The committee was selected to handle the
breadth of expertise required to review the nominated best papers. Once the camera-ready versions of
the papers were submitted by the authors, the Best Paper committee chair used the following process:
(a) Committee members were asked to notify the chair about conflicts of interest. Members with
conflicts of interest did not rank or discuss those papers with which they were conflicted. (b) Short
papers were ranked first by committee members, and additional discussions were held to make a final
decision. (c) Next, long papers were ranked by members and a smaller set of top papers were identified.
Discussions were then held to make the final decision. (d) The committee chair was available to break
any ties.
The review process was organized as a two-tier system with 18 SPC members and 382 reviewers.
The SPC members managed the review process for both the full and short paper submissions: each
paper received at least three reviews. Strict conflict-of-interest policies were in place during the review
process. Specifically, authors who served on the Program Committee in any capacity were removed
v
from any responsibility related to their paper. Any such conflict-of-interest paper was handled by
another committee member. In addition, the author was prohibited from participating in any discussion
or decision making related to the paper. A similar policy also applied if a Program Committee member
had an institutional or personal conflict with an author. All decisions on papers with these types of
conflicts were made by members without conflicts. We would not have been able to produce such an
interesting conference program without the dedicated SPC members who spent many weeks handling
and evaluating the submission reviews, nor without the reviewers who provided such thoughtful
evaluations. The full list of the SPC members and reviewers is listed elsewhere in these Proceedings.
We would also like to thank the SPC members for their best paper recommendations and suggestions
for the program, and Chris Dyer for his suggestions on the Machine Translation sessions.
There were, of course, a number of additional people with whom we directly interacted, and who
made significant contributions to the success of this conference. So, here are some well-deserved
acknowledgements. We would like to thank Rich Gerber and the START team for their help with
the system that managed paper submissions and reviews, and the Local Arrangement co-chairs, David
Chiang, Eduard Hovy, Jonathan May, and Jason Riesa, for their help with organizing the program,
the preparation and publication of the conference handbook, handling the NAACL HLT 2010 website,
and various other tasks – a list too lengthy to name here. We would also like to thank the Publication
Co-chairs, Claudia Leacock and Richard Wicentowski, for forging through a number of obstacles, and
doing an excellent job of handling the preparation and printing of these proceedings. We would like to
thank the Workshop Co-chairs, David Traum and Richard Sproat, the Demo Chair, Carolyn Penstein
Ros´e, the Tutorial Co-chairs, Jason Baldridge, Peter Clark and Gokhan Tur, and the Student Research
Workshop Faculty Co-chairs, Julia Hockenmeier and Diane Litman, and Student Co-chairs, Adriane
Boyd, Mahesh Joshi, and Frank Rudzicz. The hard work of all of these co-chairs contributed to the
quality of the entire conference program. We would also like to thank Chris Callison-Burch for handling
Student Author Support, and to Liang Huang for serving as the Student Volunteer Coordinator. We are
grateful to Priscilla Rasmussen for supporting the visa application process, as well as answering a
variety of our questions and concerns around general conference logistics and event planning. Finally,
we would like to express our deepest thanks to the General Chair, Ron Kaplan, for his continual support
and patience throughout this process.
We hope that you will have a unique and enriching conference experience!

<abstract confidence="0.997003569620253">It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the 2010 Human Language Technologies conference of the North American chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics. An enormous amount of effort has gone into organizing the conference, and the result is the rich set of intellectual and social experiences that you will enjoy this week. The NAACL HLT 2010 conference is an orchestrated production of many events. The centerpiece is the collection of carefully chosen papers, posters, and demonstrations that will be presented during the three days of the main conference. This includes the papers and posters of the Student Research Workshop, a setting that gives encouragement and opportunity for new members of our community to present their work. The main conference is preceded by a day of tutorials on topics of current interest in the field, and it is followed by a very full program of specialized workshops. Many people have volunteered their time and energy to ensure the success of the conference. Indeed, the community as a whole has contributed by submitting papers and proposals for workshops, demos, and tutorials, by making thoughtful judgments as members of the many review committees, and for coming to participate in the events this week. These contributions are very much appreciated. The heaviest burdens have been shared by the people who agreed to lead the major subcommittees of the conference, and I want to recognize them here and explicitly thank them for their service. To begin, I want to express my gratitude to Jill Burstein, Mary Harper, and Gerald Penn, the co- Chairs of the Program Committee. They supervised the selection of papers and scheduling for the main conference, recruiting the Area Chairs and managing the overall process. They chose the Noisy Genre theme of the conference, collaborated with the Area Chairs to select the Invited Speakers, administered the START reviewing system, and worked with the Area Chairs and the Local Arrangements Committee to assemble the final program. They also added a new feature to the program, a ”one-minute madness” session to raise awareness and excitement about the poster and demo presentations. The Program Committee co-Chairs and Area Chairs recommended a small number of papers for further consideration by the Best Papers Committee, chaired by Aravind Joshi. Tremendous thanks go to Aravind, Eugene Charniak, Michael Collins, Diane Litman, Daniel Marcu, and Drago Radev for their work in identifying the best examples of current work in the field. The main-conference days include some other important activities. I appreciate Kristina Toutanova’s effort to organize a second lunch-time Industry Panel, a follow-on to the successful panel at NAACL HLT 2009. I thank Carolyn Penstein Ros´e, Chair of the Demonstration Committee, for soliciting candidates for the Demo Session and overseeing the rigorous process of review. For organizing the Student Research Workshop I thank Adriane Boyd, Mahesh Joshi, and Frank Rudzicz, the student co- Chairs, and also Julia Hockenmaier and Diane Litman for the assistance and guidance they provided as Faculty Advisors. Financial support for the student workshop came from a grant from the National Science Foundation. I thank Richard Sproat and David Traum for serving as co-Chairs of the Workshop Committee. The workshop proposal and selection process was a joint activity of committees representing all three of this year’s computational linguistics conferences, the ACL conference in Uppsala, Coling in Beijing, and NAACL HLT. Their challenge was to honor the location requests of the workshop proposers while iii arranging for each conference to have a broad and balanced collection of workshops. A full complement of 16 workshops were chosen for NAACL HLT, and Richard and David then became the interface with the organizers of the individual workshops as they put out their calls, reviewed submissions, and assembled final papers for the Publications Committee. I am grateful to Jason Baldridge, Peter Clark, and Gokhan Tur for volunteering to co-Chair the Tutorial Committee and for attracting and selecting tutorials that introduce a range of novel techniques and address a number of theoretical and practical problems. The Publications Committee is responsible for constructing the written Proceedings of the conference from the materials that come from the many sources. The Publications Committee, with Claudia Leacock and Richard Wicentowski as co-Chairs, comes in at the end of the preparation stage and must operate on a strict schedule if the Proceedings are to be available by the time the conference begins. This year Claudia and Richard have been the pioneers for two major departures from past procedure. ACL proceedings in the past have been produced by a stand-alone community-developed software package, ACLPUB; this year we are using a version of that package that has been integrated directly into the START conference-management system. This should simplify the publication process for future conferences, but Claudia and Richard endured a fair amount of first-user suffering. The second departure from past practices is that for the first time we are providing the proceedings only on a USB memory stick, unaccompanied by a hardcopy volume. I deeply appreciate the care and attention with which Claudia and Richard have carried out their responsibilities. We are all very much indebted to David Chiang, Jason Riesa, Jonathan May, and Eduard Hovy, the co-Chairs of the Local Arrangements Committee, and to the other members of the committee from the USC Information Sciences Institute. They have been hard at work for the longest time, and the comfort and elegance of the conference setting is the result of the many decisions they have made. To highlight just a few, they selected the hotel, made sure that the session rooms are properly laid out and equipped, and planned for the reception and banquet. They also designed and maintained the very attractive and informative conference web site. Liang Huang served as Coordinator of the Student Volunteers, and Jillian Gerten and Kenji Sagae served as Exhibit Coordinators. I am grateful to the sponsoring organizations listed above for their financial support of the conference, and to the members of the Sponsorship Committee for identifying and nurturing those important relationships. The Sponsorship Committee–Srinivas Bangalore, Christy Doran, Eduard Hovy, Stephen Pulman, and Fr´ed´erique Segond–raised money jointly for NAACL HLT and ACL this year. The NAACL executive committee, chaired by Owen Rambow and Rebecca Hwa, provides overall supervision and maintains the continuity and traditions of the conference from year to year. They helped by identifying candidates for many of the committee positions, by resolving several significant issues of conference policy, and by overseeing the budgeting process. Finally, my heartfelt thanks go to Priscilla Rasmussen, the Business Manager of the ACL office and for the ACL conferences, for her steady guidance through all the stages of conference preparation. Priscilla, as always, played a critical role as the voice of experience and the source of wise advice that kept everything moving in the right direction.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.9369535">Thanks for attending NAACL HLT 2010! As can be seen in the Conference Program, the NAACL HLT program contains innovative, high-quality work spanning a large array of disciplines within computational linguistics and human language technology. This year, we have included a special Noisy Genre theme to acknowledge the significant work in that area across several disciplines. We would like to thank L.Venkata Subramaniam of IBM Research-India for this suggestion. NAACL HLT 2010 consists of oral and poster presentations of full and short papers, tutorials, application demonstrations, and workshops. A one-minute madness session has been introduced this year to highlight the poster and demo contributions. We are excited to have two very interesting and diverse keynote speakers: David Temperley, University of Rochester, whose talk is entitled, “Music, Language, and Computational Modeling: Lessons from the Key-Finding Problem”, and Steve Renals, University of Edinburgh, “Recognition and Understanding of Meetings.” In addition, we have a panel session Recent and Future HLT Challenges in Industry, chaired by Kristina Toutanova, which very appropriately reflects the conference theme. This year, 291 full papers were submitted and reviewed, of which 90 papers were accepted (a 30.9% acceptance rate); 159 short papers were submitted and reviewed, of which 56 were accepted (a 35.2% acceptance rate). One of the accepted short papers was withdrawn to appear elsewhere, leaving a total of 55 short papers in the proceedings. Eighty-six full papers and 25 short papers will be presented orally. The remaining 34 accepted full and short papers will be presented as posters. We would like to thank all of the authors for submitting such remarkable papers to the conference. Two best papers have been selected this year, and will be presented at the conference in a special awards session. The Best Full Paper, entitled Coreference Resolution in a Modular, Entity-Centered Model, was written by Aria Haghighi and Dan Klein. The Best Short Paper, entitled “cba to check</abstract>
<note confidence="0.626171">the spelling”: Investigating Parser Performance on Discussion Forum Posts, was written by Jennifer Foster. Congratulations to the authors! The selection process worked as follows. The Senior Program Committee (SPC) nominated an initial set of best paper candidates for the awards; the final decisions were then made by a separate committee: Aravind Joshi (chair), Eugene Charniak, Michael Collins, Diane Litman, Daniel Marcu, and Dragomir Radev. We would like to thank the committee for reading,</note>
<abstract confidence="0.97363025">discussing, and contributing to the final selection process. The committee was selected to handle the breadth of expertise required to review the nominated best papers. Once the camera-ready versions of the papers were submitted by the authors, the Best Paper committee chair used the following process: (a) Committee members were asked to notify the chair about conflicts of interest. Members with conflicts of interest did not rank or discuss those papers with which they were conflicted. (b) Short papers were ranked first by committee members, and additional discussions were held to make a final decision. (c) Next, long papers were ranked by members and a smaller set of top papers were identified. Discussions were then held to make the final decision. (d) The committee chair was available to break any ties. The review process was organized as a two-tier system with 18 SPC members and 382 reviewers. The SPC members managed the review process for both the full and short paper submissions: each paper received at least three reviews. Strict conflict-of-interest policies were in place during the review process. Specifically, authors who served on the Program Committee in any capacity were removed v from any responsibility related to their paper. Any such conflict-of-interest paper was handled by another committee member. In addition, the author was prohibited from participating in any discussion or decision making related to the paper. A similar policy also applied if a Program Committee member had an institutional or personal conflict with an author. All decisions on papers with these types of conflicts were made by members without conflicts. We would not have been able to produce such an interesting conference program without the dedicated SPC members who spent many weeks handling and evaluating the submission reviews, nor without the reviewers who provided such thoughtful evaluations. The full list of the SPC members and reviewers is listed elsewhere in these Proceedings. We would also like to thank the SPC members for their best paper recommendations and suggestions for the program, and Chris Dyer for his suggestions on the Machine Translation sessions. There were, of course, a number of additional people with whom we directly interacted, and who made significant contributions to the success of this conference. So, here are some well-deserved acknowledgements. We would like to thank Rich Gerber and the START team for their help with the system that managed paper submissions and reviews, and the Local Arrangement co-chairs, David Chiang, Eduard Hovy, Jonathan May, and Jason Riesa, for their help with organizing the program, the preparation and publication of the conference handbook, handling the NAACL HLT 2010 website, and various other tasks – a list too lengthy to name here. We would also like to thank the Publication Co-chairs, Claudia Leacock and Richard Wicentowski, for forging through a number of obstacles, and doing an excellent job of handling the preparation and printing of these proceedings. We would like to thank the Workshop Co-chairs, David Traum and Richard Sproat, the Demo Chair, Carolyn Penstein Ros´e, the Tutorial Co-chairs, Jason Baldridge, Peter Clark and Gokhan Tur, and the Student Research Workshop Faculty Co-chairs, Julia Hockenmeier and Diane Litman, and Student Co-chairs, Adriane Boyd, Mahesh Joshi, and Frank Rudzicz. The hard work of all of these co-chairs contributed to the quality of the entire conference program. We would also like to thank Chris Callison-Burch for handling Student Author Support, and to Liang Huang for serving as the Student Volunteer Coordinator. We are grateful to Priscilla Rasmussen for supporting the visa application process, as well as answering a variety of our questions and concerns around general conference logistics and event planning. Finally, we would like to express our deepest thanks to the General Chair, Ron Kaplan, for his continual support and patience throughout this process. We hope that you will have a unique and enriching conference experience!</abstract>
