Minutes of the 1979 ACL Meeting
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999012">
Following are the minutes of the 17th Annual Busi-
ness Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics, held at the University of California at San
Diego, in La Jolla, California, on August 11, 1979,
with Ronald Kaplan, President, presiding.

<bodyText confidence="0.999650967741935">
Don Walker reviewed the financial status of the
Association for 1978 and the period of 1979 through
6-30. The income figures for the two periods are
$16,634 and $9,193, respectively; the corresponding
expenses are $10,560 and $5,070; and the balances
are $6,074 and $4,123. The current assets (as of 6-
30-79) are $20,595. In perspective, the Association
can be viewed as financially healthy. A more detailed
report on financial status is included as an attachment
to these Minutes (on page 116).
Walker presented the membership status for 1977
and 1978, and for 1979 through 8-9. For those three
periods, the values for individual members were 500,
444, and 457; for institutional members, they were
201, 218, and 206; with total membership figures of
701, 662, and 663. Membership declined during
1978, but seems on the increase for 1979. A more
detailed report on membership status is included as an
attachment to these Minutes (on page 116).
According to a change in the By-Laws of the
American Federation of Information Processing Socie-
ties (AFIPS) of several years ago, for ACL to retain
its membership status, it will be necessary to reach a
total of 1500 individual members by the end of 1980.
There is a possibility that we may be able to satisfy
these requirements if we can get 900 members. Both
goals seem difficult to achieve, although it is expected
that the new phototypeset printed version of the Amer-
ican Journal of Computational Linguistics will provide a
weapon for the membership campaign. Members were
urged to encourage their colleagues to join.

Editor&apos;s Report
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989370277777778">
George Heidorn reported on the status of the
American Journal of Computational Linguistics. The
first issue is expected in September. It will include
three papers, three book reviews, and 25 abstracts,
plus a variety of announcements. Its appearance has
been delayed by the necessity to make decisions about
formats, since everything is being done for the first
time. The three papers for this issue were submitted
in machine-readable form, a practice that can provide
substantial savings on the time required for input.
Heidorn stated that the delay in publication should be
attributed to the editor; the authors, referees, and
reviewers were not to be held responsible. Some pa-
pers for future issues were already in hand; of those
submitted, three are being reviewed, eight were reject-
ed, and ten are being evaluated by the Editorial Board.
Eighteen books of the thirty received from publishers
have been assigned to reviewers.

Program Committee Report

<bodyText confidence="0.9997545">
Norman Sondheimer, as Chairman, described the
activities of the Program Committee (which consisted
of himself, Barbara Sangster, Bonnie Webber, and
Ralph Weischedel) in the organization of the Meeting.
Twenty-four of the sixty-three papers submitted were
accepted for presentation; others of good quality had
to be rejected because of time limitations and the ne-
cessity for balance in the program. Although not orig-
inally anticipated, it proved possible to prepare a Pro-
ceedings for the Meeting, copies of which have been
distributed to attendees. Many of the papers are re-
produced there in full, together with introductory
statements prepared by the people who chaired the
sessions. [The program is listed in the January-March
1980 issue of the AJCL, Volume 6, Number 1, on
page 50. Some copies of Proceedings at $5 are still
available and can be ordered from the Secretary-
Treasurer.]

Local Arrangements Committee Report

James Levin reported briefly on local arrangements,
describing the facilities available at UCSD, and the
plans later in the evening for the Banquet and for
Kaplan&apos;s presentation of the presidential address,
&amp;quot;Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science,&amp;quot;
immediately after the dinner. [The final figures for
attendance at the Meeting are as follows: 162 total,
including 73 members, 42 new-members (nonmember
registration fee credited toward membership), and 47
students (15 of whom are members).]

Executive Committee Report
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981863492753623">
Kaplan reported on the discussions at the Executive
Committee meeting which took place on 10 August.
With regard to AFIPS, he observed that the member-
ship goal they required seemed unreachable, although
114 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 2, April-June 1980
The FINITE STRING Newsletter Minutes of the 1979 ACL Meeting
the benefits of continued affiliation with that organi-
zation would make efforts toward that goal worth-
while. In any case, since additional members are of
value to the Association itself, we should try to ac-
quire as many as possible. In reference to support of
Abacus, a popular journal on computing (similar to the
Scientific American) being considered for publication
by AFIPS, he remarked that several years ago ACL
had pledged $5,000 as a guaranteed loan toward its
production. However, the Association does not have
the resources to respond to a more recent request for
venture capital funds to satisfy the requirements for an
additional $700,000. [Subsequent decisions by AFIPS
have resulted in cancellation of the plans for producing
Abacus.]
In discussing COLING-80, which is scheduled for
29 September to 4 October 1980 in Tokyo, Japan,
Kaplan noted that the relation of COLING as an or-
ganization to ACL has never been clearly established.
The Association has always provided free publicity for
those meetings, but this year it also has given $500 to
Dave Hays, the current Program Chairman, in support
of his Committee operations. While the COLING
meetings do constitute competition with ACL for pa-
pers during the years they occur, it is felt that the
cooperation is worth continuing. Kaplan also re-
marked that it may be possible for the ACL to host a
COLING meeting in the United States in conjunction
with our regular annual meeting some time in the next
few years.
The initial planning for the next ACL meeting had
considered the possibility of taking the form of a third
TINLAP (Theoretical Issues in Natural Language
Processing), following the very successful meetings in
1975 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in
1978 at the University of Illinois. However, the con-
vening of the La Jolla Conference on Cognitive Sci-
ence [which immediately followed the current meeting]
made that inappropriate. Instead, the Association is
planning to combine a meeting with submitted papers
and a parasession of invited papers on issues in inter-
active discourse. It is scheduled for the second or
third week of June, 1980, in Philadelphia. The possi-
bility of coordination with other societies to increase
the attendance is being considered.
Kaplan pointed out that there are a number of or-
ganizations whose interests overlap with those of the
ACL: AFIPS, COLING, ACM&apos;s SIGART (Special
Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence) and SI-
GLASH (Special Interest Group on Language Analysis
and Studies in the Humanities), ASIS&apos;s SIGALP
(Special Interest Group on Automated Language Proc-
essing), the Cognitive Science Society (which is just
being formed), the Association for Computers and the
Humanities, the International Joint Conferences on
Artificial Intelligence, AISB (the British/European
Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the
Simulation of Behavior), CSCSI/SCEIO (The Canadi-
an Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence),
and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Com-
puting. He said that the Executive Committee was
considering what kinds of relationships might be estab-
lished with some or all of these other groups.
