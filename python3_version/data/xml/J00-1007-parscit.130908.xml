The architectures and mechanisms
underlying language processing form
one important part of the general
structure of cognition. This book,
written by leading experts in the field,
brings together linguistic, psychological,
and computational perspectives on some
of the fundamental issues. Several general
introductory chapters offer overviews on
important psycholinguistic research
frameworks and highlight both shared
assumptions and controversial issues.
Subsequent chapters explore syntactic
and lexical mechanisms, the interaction
of syntax and semantics in language
understanding, and the implications
for cognitive architecture.

International
Phonetic Association
This book is a comprehensive guide to the
International Phonetic Alphabet, widely
used for over a century to transcribe the
sounds of languages. The Handbook is in
three parts: Part I contains an introduction
to phonetic description and exemplification
of the use of phonetic symbols; Part II
consists of twenty-nine &amp;quot;Illustrations&amp;quot; of
the application of the International Phonetic
Alphabet to a range of languages; and Part
III covers speech pathology, computer
codings, and the history of the IPA. This is
an essential reference work for phoneticians
and linguists more generally.

causation with enthusiasm and creativity.
His work is always thought provoking and
worth careful study. This book proves to be
no exception. Time and again I found myself
disagreeing both with his assumptions and
with his conclusions, but I was also fascinated
by new insights into problems I thought I
already understood well. This book illustrates
the rich contributions Pearl has made to statis-
tical literature and to our collective under-
standing of models for causal reasoning.&amp;quot;

Written by one of the preeminent scientists in
the field, this book provides a comprehensive
exposition of modern analysis of causation.
It shows how causality has grown from a
nebulous concept into a mathematical theory
with significant applications in diverse fields.
Causality will be of interest to professionals
and students in the fields of statistics, artificial
intelligence, philosophy, cognitive science,
and the health and social sciences; and, more
generally, anyone who wishes to elucidate
meaningful relationships from data, predict
effects of actions and policies, assess explana-
tions of reported events, or form theories of
causal understanding and causal speech.

Ehud Reiter and Robert Dale
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.850787846153846">
This book explains how to build
Natural Language Generation (NLG)
systems—computer software systems that
automatically generate understandable texts
in English or other human languages. NLG
systems use knowledge about language and
the application domain to automatically
produce documents, reports, explanations,
help messages, and other kinds of texts. The
book covers the algorithms and representations
needed to perform the core tasks of document
planning, microplanning, and surface realiza-
tion, using a case study to show how these
components fit together. It is essential reading
for researchers interested in NLP, Al, and
HCI; and for developers interested in
advanced document-creation technology.

Coarticulation
Theory, Data and Techniques
William J. Hardcastle and
Nigel Hewlett, Editors
Coarticulation means the overlapping
that occur during the pronunciation of any
sequence of speech sounds. This topic in
the science of phonetics provides a challenge
to speech production theory as well as to
various projects in the field of speech tech-
nology, including that of building a natural
sounding speech synthesizer. The eighteen
chapters in this book cover the experimental
techniques used for investigating the
phenomenon, the experimental findings
to date, and the theoretical background.

of natural, formal, and programming languages, as well as the different forms of
human and mechanized inference. It covers the logical, linguistic, and information-
theoretic parts of the cognitive sciences. Examples of main subareas are Intensional
Logics including Dynamic Logic; Nonmonotonic Logic and Belief Revision;
Constructive Logics; Complexity Issues in Logic and Linguistics; Theoretical Problems
of Logic Programming and Resolution; Categorial Grammar and Type Theory;
Generalized Quantification; Information-Oriented Theories of Semantic Structure
like Situation Semantics, Discourse Representation Theory, and Dynamic Semantics;
Connectionist Models of Logical and Linguistic Structures. The emphasis is on the
theoretical aspects of these areas. The purpose of the journal is to act as a forum
for researchers interested in the theoretical foundations of the above subjects and
their interdisciplinary connections, with an emphasis on general ideas increasing
coherence.

BENEFITS, PAYMENT AND ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS
Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are paid
Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal, Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsorei
conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Payments for membership dues, fund donations, back issues, am
proceedings may be made in Europe or the USA. IMPORTANT NOTE: Renewals must be received no later than I Apri
2000 to avoid late payment fee assessment. Membership categories include Regular Members and the following: Couple!
with the same mailing address may be Joint Members; they will receive only one set of publications, but each will be eligiblo
for all other member benefits. Students taking a full-time program of courses and not earning a regular income may becomi
Student Members WITH COPY OF CURRENT STUDENT ID. Students who are not Student Members because of thei
income can still participate in student activities as Student-Employed. Also available are Retired and Unemployei
memberships. We now offer MULTI-YEAR MEMBERSHIPS to Regular and Joint members. If no indication is providel
of multi-year membership preference, one-year membership will be presumed for Regular and Joint. Late payment fee doe

Guidelines for Submissions
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</note>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.851333">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960066117647059">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to
forty double-spaced.pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electroni-
cally; consult http:/ /www.aclweb.org/cl/submit.txt for instructions and pointers to the L TEX
style files. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies
the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to
another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-
refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing
Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring
frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural
language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics
of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language
Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed;
others are likely to be added.

This book, written by leading experts in the field, brings together linguistic, psychological, and computational perspectives on some of the fundamental issues. Several general introductory chapters offer overviews on important psycholinguistic research frameworks and highlight both shared assumptions and controversial issues. Subsequent chapters explore syntactic and lexical mechanisms, the interaction of syntax and semantics in language understanding, and the implications for cognitive architecture.</abstract>
