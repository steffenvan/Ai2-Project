As electronic communications is now increasing, the term Natural Language Processing should be
considered in the broader aspect of Multi-Language processing system. Observation of the language
behavior will provide a good basis for design of computational language model and also creating cost-

As electronic communications are now
increasing, the term Natural Language Processing
should be considered in the broader aspect of
Multi- Language Processing system. An important
phase in the system development process is
requirement engineering, which can define as the
process of analyzing the problems in a certain
language. An essential part of the requirement-
engineering phase is computational language
modeling which is an abstract representation of
the behavior of the language. In order to have a
good language model for creating cost-effective
solutions to the practical problems, the language
resources are necessary for the language behavior
analysis.
This paper intended to express what we
have and what we have done by the desire to
make a bridge between the languages and to
share and make maximal use of the existing
lexica, corpus and the tools. Three main topics
are, then, focussed:

• A State of the Art of Thai language
Resources that will give an overview of what we
have in Corpus, Lexicon and tools for corpus

New word formation and Phrase/Sentence
construction, and
• The computational models providing
for those behaviors, which consist of Unknown
Word Extraction and Name Entities identification,
New word generation and Noun phrase

2.1 Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999831730769231">
The existing Thai corpus is divided into 2
types; speech and text corpus developed by many
Thai Universities. Thai Language Audio Resource
Center of Thammasart University (ThaiARC)
(http:// thaiarc.ac.th) developed speech corpus
aimed to provide digitized audio information for
dissemination via Internet. The project pioneers
the production and collection of various types of
audio information and various styles of Thai
speech, such as royal speeches, academic lectures,
oral literature, etc.
For Text corpus, originally, the goal of the
corpus collecting is used only inside the
laboratory. Until 1996, National Electronics and
Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) and
Communications Research Laboratory (CRL) had
a collaboration project with the purpose of
preparing Thai language corpus from technical
proceedings for language study and application
research. It named ORCHID corpus (NECTEC,
1997). NAiST Corpus began in 1996 with the
primary aim of collecting document from
magazines for training and testing program in
Written Production Assistance (Asanee, 1995).
The existing corpus can be summarized as shown
in Table 1.

3.1 Lexicon Growth
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981435">
The lexicon growth is studied by using Word
list Extraction tool to extract word lists from a
large-scale corpus and mapping to the Royal
Institute Dictionary (RID). It is noticeable that
there are two types of lexicon: common and
unknown words. The common word lists are some
words in RID, which occur in almost every
document, and use in daily life. They are primitive

The lexicon growth is observed from corpus
size, 400,000, 2,154,700 and 60,511,974 words
from Newspaper, Magazine and Agriculture text.
We found that common word lists increased from
111,954 to 839,522 and 49,136,408 words
according to the corpus size, while the unknown
word lists increased from 288,046 to 1,315,178
and 11,375,566 words respectively as shown in
table3.

Regarding to 60,511,974 words corpus in the
table 3, it composes of 35,127,012 words from
Newspaper, 18,359,724 words from Magazine and
7,025,238 words from Agricultural Text.
Unknown words occur in each category as shown
in table 4.

According to table 3 and 4, we could observe that
not only unknown words increase but common
words also increase and the main categories of
increasing unknown word are proper names and
foreign words. Consequently, a computational
model of unknown word extraction and name
entity identification has been developed and also
of new word construction.

Regarding to the growth of common word
shown in table 3, we studied how the new words
come from.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.528778">
3.2.1 Basic Information about Thai
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999065142857143">
Thai words are multi-syllabic words which
stringing together could form a new word. Since
Thai has no inflection and no word delimiters,
Thai morphological processing is mainly to
recognize word boundaries instead of recognizing
a lexical form from a surface form as in English.
Let C be a sequence of characters
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.977514">
C = c1c2c3...cn : n&gt;=1
Let W be a sequence of words
W = w1w2w3...wm : m&gt;=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994613444444444">
Where wi = c1ic2i...ci r: i&gt;=1, r&gt;=2
Since Thai sentences are formed with a
sequence of words with a stream of characters,
i.e., c1c2c3...cn mostly without explicit
delimiters, the word boundary in “c1c2c3c4c5“
pattern as shown below could have two
ambiguous forms. One is “c1c2“ and “c3c4c5“.
The other one is “c1c2c3“ and “c4c5“
(Kawtrakul, 1997)
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999367">
Figure 1: Word Boundary Ambiguity
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.996539285714286">
From the figure 1, if characters were grouped
differently, the meaning of words will be changed
too. For example, “กอดอก” can be grouped to “กอด-
อก(fold one&apos;s arms across the chest)” and “กอ-ดอก (a
clump of flower)”. From our corpus, we found
that the sentence with 45 characters has 30
combinations of words sequence.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.897595">
3.2.2 New word construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999806666666667">
Almost all-Thai new words are formed by
means of compounding and nominalization, by
using a set of prefixes.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.683071" genericHeader="method">
3.2.2.1 Nominalization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995694444444445">
Nominalization is a process by which a word
can be formed as a noun by using prefixes added.
Noun words formed by using prefixes “การ(ka:n)”
and “ความ(khwa:m)”are nouns which signal state or
action. Words formed by using prefixes “ผู(phu:)”
“ชาว(tha:w)” and “นัก(nak)”are nouns which signal
human or profession.
Prefix “ การ(ka:n)” “ ความ(khwa:m)” are used in
the process of forming a noun from verb or verb

phrase and sometimes from noun
(Nominalization). การ(ka:n) that co-occur with
noun, represents the meaning about duty or
function of noun it relates to. การ(ka:n) that co-
occur with verbs, always occur with action verbs.
ความ(khwa:m) always co-occur with state verbs.

Prefix “ ผู(phu:) “ “ นัก(nak)” and “ชาว(t9ha:w)”

<bodyText confidence="0.752789625">
are used in the process of new word formation. ผู
(phu:) and นัก(nak) co-occur with verb phrase. นัก
(nak) sometimes can occur with a few fields of
nouns, such as sport and music. So at the first time
we kept words, which constructed from prefix “นัก
(nak)” plus noun in the lexicon for solving the
problem. Prefix “ชาว(t9ha:w)” can co-occur with
noun only.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.571234">
3.2.2.2 Compounding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.959948444444444">
Thai new words can, also, be combined to
form compound nouns and are invented almost
daily. They normally have at least two parts. The
first part represents a pointed object or person
such as คน(man), หมอ(pot), หาง(tail), พืช(plant). The
second part identifies what kind of object or
person it is, or what its purpose is like ขับรถ(drive a
car), หุงขาว(cook rice), เสือ(tiger), นํ้ า(water). Table 5
shows the examples of compound noun in Thai.

<bodyText confidence="0.964173833333333">
From Table 6, it has shown that some
compound nouns maintain some parts of those
primitive word meaning but some changed to a
new meaning. In this paper, we are only interested
in compound noun grouping from primitive words
which were changed the meaning to more abstract
but still maintain some parts of those primitive
word meanings, e.g. “คนรถ(driver) คนครัว(cooker)
etc.” The word “คน” maintains its meaning which
has a concept of human, but when it was
compounded with “รถ(car)” and “ครัว(kitchen)”,
their meanings have changed to the occupation by
the word relation in the equivalent level. In case of
compound noun that change a whole meaning
such as “ลูกเสือ (a boy scout)”, it will be kept in the
lexicon.
3.2.2.3 Compound noun extraction problems
There are three non-trivial problems
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999946666666667">
• Compound Noun VS Sentence Distinction

</listItem>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.308086">
Compound Noun VS Sentence
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977265571428571">
Several NP structures have the same pattern as
sentences. Since Thai language is flexible and has
no word derivation, including to preposition in
compound noun can be omitted, etc. This causes a
compound noun having the same pattern as
sentence. Thus, Thai NP analysis in IR system is
more difficult than English. (See Figure 2)

In figure 2, compound noun “โตะกินขาว” (a
dining table) actually omit the preposition “สํ าหรับ
(for)”, which is a relation that point to the purpose
of the first noun “โตะ(table)”.

that noun phrase into sub noun phrase or
compound noun in order to specify the core noun
as index and its modifier as sub-index. For
example, compound noun with “noun + noun +
verb” structure: เด็ก(child/N)ผม(hair/N)ยาว (long/V)
etc. In this case, the second noun and verb have to
be grouped firstly since it behaves similarly to a
modifier by omitting the relative pronoun that
represents its purpose, i.e., “who has”.
Another case of Compound Noun Boundary
Ambiguity is word combination. Consider the
sequence of words as the example of NP that
composes of four words as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.912521">
NP = N1N2N3N4
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998164">
There are 8 word combinations of compound
noun as shown in figure 3.

<figureCaption confidence="0.998555">
Figure 3: Patterns of noun phrase analysis
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9827324375">
In figure 3, word string has to be grouped
correctly for the correct meaning.
The ambiguity of noun phrase boundary has
also directly effected the efficiency of text
retrieval.
Core Noun detection
Due to the Information Retrieval, a head or
core of noun phrase detection is necessary. In this
paper, core noun refers to the most important and
specific word that the information retrieval and
extraction can directly retrieve or extract without
over generating candidate words. However, by
the observation, the core of noun phrase needs not
to be the initial words. Some of them are at the
final position and some have word relation in the
equivalent level (As shown in Table 7).

units, which are parts of a larger unit.
Constituency is usually shown by a tree diagram
or by square brackets:
Ex. [[�ns�s��������ss��ns] [td-n snlvs��U]]
[[meeting committee] [very smoothly]].
Constituent acts as a chunk that can be moved
together and it often occurs in Thai language (see
Fig. 4). The constituents can be moved to the
front, the middle or the end of the sentence.

a pro-form. It is often described as “referring

Thai relative pronouns “ที่” (thi) ”ซึ่ง(sung)” and ”
อัน(un)” relate to group of nouns or other pronouns
(The student “ที่” (thi) studies hardest usually does
the best.). The word “ที่” (thi) connects or relates
the subject, student, to the verb within the
dependent clause (studies). Generally, we use “ที่”
(thi) and ” ”ซึ่ง(sung)” to introduce clauses that are
parenthetical in nature (i.e., that can be removed
from the sentence without changing the essential
meaning of the sentence. The pronoun “ที่” (thi) and
”ซึ่ง(sung)” refers to things and people and ”อัน(un)”
usually refers to things, but it can also refer to
event in general.
The relative pronoun is sometimes omitted
because it makes the sentence more efficient and

The hybrid model approach has been used for
unknown word recognition. The approach is the
combination of a statistical model and a set of
context based rules. A statistical model is used to
identify unknown word’s boundary. The set of
context based rules, then, will be used to extract
the unknown word’s semantic concept. If the
unknown word has no context, a set of unknown
word information, which has defined through
corpus analysis, will be generated and the best one
will be selected, as its semantic concept, by using
the semantic tagging model. Unknown word
recognition process is shown in figure 6.

4.2 New Word Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859153846154">
Word formation is proposed to reduce the
lexicon size by constructing new words or
compound noun from the existing words. Based
on word formation rules and common dictionary,
the shallow parser will extract a set of candidate
compound nouns. Then probabilistic approach
based on syntactic structure and statistical data is
used to solve the problem of over- and under-
generation of new word construction and prune
the erroneous of compound noun from the
candidate set. The process of new word
construction is shown in figure 8. See more detail
in (Pengphon, N. et al, 2002)

<bodyText confidence="0.999391944444444">
After unknown words have been extracted,
Named Entity (NE) Identification will define the
category of unknown word. The model based on
heuristic rules and mutual information. Mutual
information or statistical analysis of word
collocation is used to solve boundary ambiguity
when names were composed with known and
unknown words. We use Knowledge based such
as list of known name (such as country names),
clue word list (such as person’s title) to support
the heuristic rules. Using clue word or common
noun that precedes the name can specify NE
categorization. Based on the case grammar, NE
categories can also defined. Moreover, the lists of
the names from predefined NE Ontology can be
used for predicting category too. The overview of
our system is shown in figure 7. More detail sees

The first step is morphological analysis for
word segmentation and POS tagging. At the
second step, the compound word is grouped into
one word by using word formation module (see
4.2). The third step, statistical-based technique is
used to identify phrase boundary. This step was
provided for identifying the phrase boundary by
using NP rules. Next step is Noun Phrase
Segmentation. The condition of noun phrase
segmentation is shown in figure 10.
Figure 10 Noun phrase Segmentation
After noun phrase is correctly detected, the
relation in noun phrases will be extracted. There
are 2 types of relation: head-head noun phrase and
head-modifier noun phrase. The process is based
on statistical techniques by considering the
frequency (fi) of each word (wi) in the document
(See figure 11).

<bodyText confidence="0.999345333333333">
The computational language models for
Thai in word and phrase level, consisting of
Unknown Word Extraction and Name Entities
identification, New word generation and Noun
phrase recognition, are studied on the basis of
their behavior analysis from the varieties of
corpus. We expected that it could create cost-
effective solutions to the practical problems in the
application developments especially in Thai
Information Retrieval and Information extraction
system. We also give the gateway to access Thai
language resources with hoping that it could be
the bridge of the international collaboration for
developing Multi-Language Processing
applications.

Observation of the language behavior will provide a good basis for design of computational language model and also creating costeffective solutions to the practical problems. In order to have a good language modeling, the language resources are necessary for the language behavior analysis. This paper intended to express what we have and what we have done by the desire to make a bridge between the languages and to share and make maximal use of the existing lexica, corpus and the tools.
