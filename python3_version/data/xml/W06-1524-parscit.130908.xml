In this paper, structures involving the rais-
ing verb seem, are examined. Specifically,
it is shown that previously-proposed ele-
mentary trees for seem with an experiencer
argument are inadequate, based upon syn-
tactic testing. In Storoshenko (2006), new
articulated structures for the seem pred-
icate are proposed, modelled upon the
treatment of ditransitive verbs. This pa-
per recapitulates and further motivates the
ditransitive-style analysis, while illustrat-
ing its potential value in issues surround-
ing extraction and the raising construction
in TAG.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999814">
The raising predicate seem is often cited as one of
the core examples in discussions of TAG’s appli-
cation to natural language syntax. Under a gener-
ative/minimalist account, a sentence such as (1a)
will have the underlying structure in (1b):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.858421">
(1) a. John seems to like coffee.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998024">
In TAG, the subject John remains local to the ele-
mentary tree headed by like, the elementary tree in
which its theta role is assigned. The observed dis-
placement effect is a result of the extension of the
like-headed tree after the adjunction of an auxil-
iary tree headed by seem (Kroch and Joshi, 1985).
In the more recent analysis of Frank (2002), a sen-
tence such as (1a) is derived through the composi-
tion of the elementary trees of Figure 1 to derive
the final tree in Figure 2.

At issue in this paper will be the structure of sen-

Here, a prepositional phrase to me now appears
in the clause; as illustrated, its position is vari-
able. The individual introduced in this preposi-
tional phrase is interpreted as being an experiencer
of the verb seem, in no way dependent upon the
embedded like predicate. As such, according to
the Fundamental TAG Hypothesis (Frank, 2002),
this experiencer must be composed as a part of the
seem auxiliary tree. For discursive ease, the case
in (2a) will be termed a medial experiencer, and
the (2b) case will be a final experiencer. What is
now required is an auxiliary tree for seem which
retains the desired recursivity, and supports this
experiencer in either possible position. Further
syntactic diagnostics will be used to determine the
necessary shape of such an auxiliary tree.

1.2 An Existing Account

In Frank (2002), a structure is given for this type
of raising verb with an experiencer, as in Figure 3.
this structure: first of all, are the complements of
the verb straightforwardly interchangeable (to ac-
count for the variable position of the experiencer),
and is there any evidence for or against the ternary
branching structure? These questions emerge to be
inter-related, and in exploring the consequences of
the ternary structure, it will be shown that simple
transposition of the verb’s complements is not an
option within a flat ternary structure.

2 Establishing Argumenthood
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999864384615385">
Before embarking upon a discussion of the con-
sequences of Frank’s ternary branching structure,
a more straightforward solution must be consid-
ered. Instead of treating it as a part of the seem-
headed tree, one could attempt to formulate an
argument that the prepositional phrase bearing
the experiencer is introduced as a syntactic ad-
junct. This could be conceivably be accomplished
through the use of one of the two trees of Figure
4. These are adjunct auxiliary trees, recursive on
VP, which would introduce an experiencer prepo-
sitional phrase at either the left or right periphery
of the VP, respectively.

This tree would adjoin into the T node of an in-
finitival clause tree, as in Figure 1, yielding the
correct string order (after substitution of the fron-
tier DP-experiencer), for a raising sentence with a
medial experiencer (2a). Frank’s discussion of this
ternary structure is essentially limited to the well-
formedness of its functional architecture, and the
fact that a stipulation will need to be put in place to
obviate the satisfaction of the T head’s EPP feature
by the experiencer. While a valid point, there are
still two key unanswered questions with regards to
to

periencer prepositional phrase
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998534">
While an anonymous reviewer points out that
considering the experiencer to be an argument of
seem is quite uncontroversial, there does appear
to be some evidence that a prepositional phrase of
this form, serving to introduce something akin to
an experiencer, can exist independent of the pred-
icate seem:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9946925">
(3) a. ? John to me likes coffee.
b. John likes coffee to me.
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.988192">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989228">
While the first example here sounds quite marginal
to the ears of most native speakers, the second sen-
tence is perfectly acceptable, and is a likely para-
phrase of a sentence such as John seems/appears
to like coffee to me. This suggests at least the pos-
sibility that the prepositional phrase bearing the
experiencer might be considered an adjunct&apos;.
However, in the case of a sentence such as (2a),
it can be easily demonstrated that adjunction of
the prepositional phrase as an independent auxil-
iary tree is not an option. Adjunction of the right-
recursive VP tree of Figure 4 into the VP node of
either tree of Figure 1 would, after all the trees
were composed, yield one of the following string
orders:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9805915">
(4) a. * John seems to to me like coffee.
b. * John to me seems to like coffee.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999447772727272">
As shown, there is no way to derive the me-
dial experiencer string-order using a simple VP-
adjunction tree. This provides clear evidence that
the mechanics of TAG derivation force an analysis
where at least the medial experiencer must enter
the derivation as a part of the seem auxiliary, giv-
ing further thrust to the contention that the experi-
encer here is indeed an argument of seem.
In turning to the experiencer in final position,
matters are less clear-cut, as there is a viable struc-
ture in which the prepositional phrase can adjoin
to the seem auxiliary and appear at the end of
the sentence, using the left-recursive tree of Fig-
ure 4. Recalling the examples of (3), it is pos-
sibly even more important to establish the argu-
menthood of this position, as there are strikingly
similar sentences in which the equivalent prepo-
sitional phrase appears to be a bona fide adjunct.
For the final experiencers of seem, evidence can
be provided to show that the prepositional phrase
is not opaque to extraction, and therefore not an
adjunct:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.91744025">
(5) a. The woman whom John seemed to
like coffee to t kept refilling his cup.
b. John seems to like coffee to the wait-
ress. Her boss, too.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989026192307693">
&apos;The possibility that sentences such as those in (3) are de-
rived from a raising structure from which the raising predicate
seem was subsequently elided can be easily dismissed. Aside
from employing a host of tests to identify elision phenomena,
one must simply observe that the verb like appears with finite
tense, a distinct anomaly if one were to treat it as having been
part of a raising structure.
c. Who is it that you saw the woman
who seemed to like coffee to him ?
In (5a), it is quite clear that the experiencer can be
relativised out of the final position with no diffi-
culty at all. Similarly, the stripping case in (5b),
where it also seems to Mary’s boss that John likes
coffee, indicates that the experiencer her boss can
be extraposed from the sentence final position, and
the rest of the sentence stripped away. Finally, the
use of a resumptive pronoun to repair the com-
plex noun phrase constraint violation in (5c) pro-
vides further proof that the final-position prepo-
sitional phrase is not opaque to extraction. This
is thus an argument position, part of the seem-
headed auxiliary. As such, the question left at the
end of Section 1 must now be answered: can the
ternary-branching auxiliary tree account for inde-
pendent syntactic observations related to this par-
ticular structure?

3 An Alternative View
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965428571429">
At first glance, Frank’s ternary branching struc-
ture is reminiscent of early accounts of ditransi-
tive verbs. Such structures were famously argued
against in Larson (1988), and subsequently re-
examined in Harley (2002). In these treatments, a
ternary structure is replaced with a VP-shell struc-
ture, as schematised in Figure 5.

In the lower VP, the goal and theme of a di-
transitive verb are projected as the specifier and
complement, respectively. The verb itself then
raises to an upper VP, which supports the agent
of the ditransitive predicate. The motivation for
adopting this structure lay in the observation of c-
command phenomena between the goal and theme

positions. In a flat ternary structure, mutual c-
command between these two positions would be
expected, however Larson gives considerable data
to argue that mutual c-command does not exist be-
tween these two positions.
In looking at the tree from Figure 3, it is clear
that straightforward considerations of mutual c-
command will not be informative, as one of the
ternary branches of the seem-headed tree will con-
tain the remainder of the embedded clause ma-
terial which exists below the T adjunction site.
However, what can be observed is whether or not
a c-command relation exists between the experi-
encer of seem and the embedded clause theme.
This will speak to the matter of the possible trans-
position of the VP complements: if they do indeed
exist in a flat structure, then the experiencer should
c-command the embedded clause theme from both
the medial and final positions2.
In Storoshenko (2006), it is argued that a seem
auxiliary with an experiencer should be analysed
with a similar VP-shell analysis. Among the ev-
idence provided, three of Larson’s c-command
tests are employed to illustrate that the experiencer
of seem does c-command the embedded clause ob-
ject when in the medial position:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998922166666667">
(6) a. John seems to nobody to like any-
thing. (NPI Licensing)
b. John seems to every boy to like him .
(Bound Variable)
c. * What does John seem to whom to
like t ? (Superiority)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932545454545">
For negative polarity licensing and bound vari-
able readings to obtain in these cases, the expe-
riencer must c-command the direct object. Sim-
ilarly, the fact that extraction of the embedded
clause theme (which would not in itself be the
product of an ill-formed elementary tree), is un-
grammatical here. This is a straightforward supe-
riority violation, again illustrating that the experi-
encer c-commands the embedded theme.
The opposite is demonstrated to be the case
where the experiencer is in the final position:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.78929">
(7) a. * John seems to like anything to no-
body.
b. John seems to like him to every boy .
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.961171666666667">

<bodyText confidence="0.991160466666667">
c. What does John seem to like t to
whom?
Here, the negative polarity item is not licensed,
and a bound variable reading does not obtain.
However, the embedded theme can be extracted
in the case where the experiencer is in the final
position. These results demonstrate that in the fi-
nal position, the experiencer does not c-command
the embedded object, contrary to what would be
expected of a flat ternary structure like that of Fig-
ure 4. The experiencer must not be in a position
where it c-commands the embedded clause mate-
rial beneath T . The elementary trees for seem
with an experiencer in medial and final position,
respectively, are given in Figure 6.

As in the case of the ditransitive structure of
Figure 5, there is verb movement here. The lower
VP supports the experiencer and the T foot node,
essential if recursivity is to be maintained, while
seem itself raises to an upper VP projection. Un-
like the ditransitive case, seem projects no position
for an agent argument, which retains Frank’s argu-
mentation for having an elementary tree rooted in

T . Crucially, this movement is licensed within
TAG, as it remains local to this one elementary
tree, and has no impact upon the recursive nature
of the tree.
In terms of the relationship between the two
experiencer positions, there are two possibilities,
both of which have been explored in the paral-
lel literature on ditransitives. In the pattern of
Larson (1988), the two trees of Figure 6 would
be derivationally related, one having been derived
from the other. Countering this is the approach
of Harley (2002), in which similar alternations are
argued to be the result of lexically distinct (yet
phonetically indistinguishable) predicates project-
ing different syntactic structures. The second ar-
gument is taken in Storoshenko (2006): there is
no derivational relationship between the two trees
Figure 6. Each is headed by a seem predicate
which specifies whether the experiencer appears
in the medial or final position.
Beyond c-command facts, there is additional
evidence that such an articulated structure for
seem may be required. An anonymous reviewer
comments that the opening of potential adjunction
sites is a common motivation for binarism over
ternary structures in TAG-based syntax. In this
case, neither the seem-headed tree of Figure 1 or
3 will account for the position of a VP-adjoined
manner or temporal adjunct modifying the raising
predicate:
(8) a. John seems for all intents and pur-
poses to be a professor to me.
b. John seemed for as long as we knew
him to like coffee.
Assuming these adjuncts to be introduced through
elementary trees recursive on VP, only the pres-
ence of the lower VP node in the shell structure
allows for an adjunction into the seem auxiliary
which yields the correct string order. Indeed, (8b)
may indicate that the shell structure is required
even in cases where there is no experiencer.

4 Extending the Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999815833333333">
Thus far, this discussion has been limited to cases
in which seem is adjoined into an infinitival clause.
There are at least two other types of structure on
which this analysis needs to be tested: those where
seem adjoins into a small clause, and those where
seem takes a finite clause complement:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.747816">
(9) a. John seems happy.
b. It seems that John likes coffee.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913928571429">
In exploring these cases, a further challenge to the
ditransitive-style analysis arises. While the expe-
riencer is licit in both positions where the seem-
headed tree is adjoined into an infinitival clause,
apparent asymmetries can be noted in these other
constructions, calling into question the broader ap-
plicability of the structures in Figure 6. Where the
seem auxiliary has adjoined into a small clause,
the experiencer is degraded in the position imme-
diately following seem, and is more acceptable in
the sentence-final position, as in (10). Conversely,
in the finite complement case, the experiencer is
marginal at best in the sentence-final position, il-
lustrated in (11).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8742896">
(10) a. ? John seems to me happy.
b. John seems happy to me.
(11) a. It seems to me that John likes coffee.
b. ? It seems that John likes coffee to
me.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823428571428">
However, it has been pointed out (Tatjana Schef-
fler, p.c.) that considerations of phonetic weight
may be at work in these cases. For the small clause
cases, replacing the simple adjective with a more
complex element yields a more comfortable sen-
tence with the medial experiencer, and the experi-
encer in final position now seems more awkward:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.602668333333333">
(12) a. John seems to me competent enough
to finish the task at hand.
b. John seems competent enough to fin-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9979655">
ish the task at hand to me.
The same reversal can be observed with the finite
clause cases where a heavier experiencer appears
alongside the complement clause. The sentence
final experiencer is made to seem much more nat-
ural than in the simpler case above:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989112">
(13) a. It seems to all of the cafe’s customers
that John likes coffee.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.954851555555556">
b. It seems that John likes coffee to all of
the cafe’s customers.
Taking this into consideration, these apparent
variations are nothing more than red herrings, with
the relative positioning of experiencer and embed-
ded material demonstrating sensitivity to consid-
erations of phonetic weight. Such considerations
may determine which seem-headed auxiliary is the
better choice for native speakers in a given context.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996836">
163
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992230769231">
Furthermore, difficulties in the case of (11b)
may be a function of ambiguity. An alternative
derivation does exist in which the PP to me is not
an argument of seem. Recalling the cases where
a “pseudo-”experiencer appeared without an ac-
companying raising predicate, it is possible that
the to me of (11b) and to all the cafe’s customers
of (13b) are adjuncts to the embedded clause VP,
in the same pattern as (3b). Extraction tests along
the lines of those employed earlier can be used to
show that the experiencer can be an argument, but
this still will not negate the fact that a derivation
exists wherein it may simply be an adjunct.

5 Conclusion and Implications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984">
With the elimination of challenges to this new
analysis of seem, the conclusion is that the struc-
tures in Figure 6 are justified, and generalisable to
many uses of the verb. Potential counterexamples
are either functions of weight considerations, or
interference from ambiguous analyses.
Having used extraction-based tests to reach this
conclusion, it is worth noting that accounting for
extraction from the seem auxiliary tree remains a
problem for TAG (Frank, 2002). A Wh-question
formed through the extraction of the experiencer
argument would necessarily be extended all the
way to CP, thus sacrificing recursivity. While this
problem has not been solved here, the refinements
to the structure of seem will contribute to future
accounts. Specifically, any account of extraction
which is sensitive to issues such as superiority or
crossover will benefit from this analysis. Consider
the sentences in (14):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978933333333333">
(14) a. Bill seems to John to like him .
b. Bill seems to like him to John .
c. To whom does Bill seem to like him ?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966">
In theory, either of (14a) or (14b) could repre-
sent the underlying structure of (14c). Binding,
as shown in (14c), is possible for this question,
though only the (14a) sentence shows equivalent
binding. Extraction of the experiencer in the
(14b) case would result in a weak-crossover vio-
lation, should the extracted experiencer bind the
embedded object. This asymmetry between (14a)
and (14b) would not be predicted by a ternary-
branching analysis, but is captured by the struc-
tures in Figure 6. These sorts of alternations, and
their implications, will need to be kept in mind as
further work on extraction from raising predicates
progresses.

As such, according to the Fundamental TAG Hypothesis (Frank, 2002), this experiencer must be composed as a part of the seem auxiliary tree. For discursive ease, the case in (2a) will be termed a medial experiencer, and the (2b) case will be a final experiencer. What is now required is an auxiliary tree for seem which retains the desired recursivity, and supports this experiencer in either possible position. Further syntactic diagnostics will be used to determine the necessary shape of such an auxiliary tree. 1.2 An Existing Account In Frank (2002), a structure is given for this type of raising verb with an experiencer, as in Figure 3. this structure: first of all, are the complements of the verb straightforwardly interchangeable (to account for the variable position of the experiencer), and is there any evidence for or against the ternary branching structure? These questions emerge to be inter-related, and in exploring the consequences of the ternary structure, it will be shown that simple transposition of the verb’s complements is not an option within a flat ternary structure. 2 Establishing Argumenthood Before embarking upon a discus</context>

Potential counterexamples are either functions of weight considerations, or interference from ambiguous analyses. Having used extraction-based tests to reach this conclusion, it is worth noting that accounting for extraction from the seem auxiliary tree remains a problem for TAG (Frank, 2002). A Wh-question formed through the extraction of the experiencer argument would necessarily be extended all the way to CP, thus sacrificing recursivity. While this problem has not been solved here, the refinements to the structure of seem will contribute to future accounts. Specifically, any account of extraction which is sensitive to issues such as superiority or crossover will benefit from this analysis. Consider the sentences in (14): (14) a. Bill seems to John to like him . b. Bill seems to like him to John . c. To whom does Bill seem to like him ? In theory, either of (14a) or (14b) could</context>

The opposite is demonstrated to be the case where the experiencer is in the final position: (7) a. * John seems to like anything to nobody. b.

Under a generative/minimalist account, a sentence such as (1a) will have the underlying structure in (1b): (1) a. John seems to like coffee. In TAG, the subject John remains local to the elementary tree headed by like, the elementary tree in which its theta role is assigned. The observed displacement effect is a result of the extension of the like-headed tree after the adjunction of an auxiliary tree headed by seem (Kroch and Joshi, 1985). In the more recent analysis of Frank (2002), a sentence such as (1a) is derived through the composition of the elementary trees of Figure 1 to derive the final tree in Figure 2.

However, what can be observed is whether or not a c-command relation exists between the experiencer of seem and the embedded clause theme. This will speak to the matter of the possible transposition of the VP complements: if they do indeed exist in a flat structure, then the experiencer should c-command the embedded clause theme from both the medial and final positions2. In Storoshenko (2006), it is argued that a seem auxiliary with an experiencer should be analysed with a similar VP-shell analysis. Among the evidence provided, three of Larson’s c-command tests are employed to illustrate that the experiencer of seem does c-command the embedded clause object when in the medial position: (6) a. John seems to nobody to like anything. (NPI Licensing) b. John seems to every boy to like him . (Bound Variable) c. * What does John seem to whom to like t ?
