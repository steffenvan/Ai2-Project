<bodyText confidence="0.999376133333333">
A framework for translating speaker&apos;s
meaning or intention is proposed based on two
notions, Illocutionary Force Types (IFTs) for
analysis and Decision Parameters (DPs) for
generation. IFTs are a certain kind of
classification of utterances concerning speaker&apos;s
meaning. DPs present background information
of language use in order to derive an appropriate
expression from speaker&apos;s meaning. In Japanese,
IFTs can be derived automatically through
syntactical constraints. To generate appropriate
expressions, language-specific communication
strategies related to DP values should be given a
priori. The whole process is performed in a
unification-based framework.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999930804347826">
In devising a machine translation system of
telephone dialogues, one of the problems is how to
adequately translate the underlying meaning of
the source utterance, or the speaker&apos;s intention,
into the target language. Such a concern is rarely
observed in conventional machine translation
research, which has focused on strictly
grammatical translation divorced from
consideration of the speaker&apos;s situation and
intentions (Tsujii and Nagao 1988). However, in
dialogue, smoothness of communication depends
on perceiving the speaker&apos;s intention. Especially
when dealing with different language family
pairs such as Japanese and English, it is
necessary to have a methodology of treating
language-specific communication strategies in a
universal framework.
Although the input of our machine translation
system is spoken dialogue, here we leave aside
the issues of speech processing and limit our
discussion to linguistic processing. Extra-
grammatical sentence patterns such as intra-
sentential correction, stammering, and inversion
are not treated either. Our framework fo,
translating speaker&apos;s intention is based on twc
notions, Illocutionary Force Types (IFTs), i.e. e
classification of the .speaker&apos;s intentions, and
Decision Parameters (DPs), i.e. feature,
representing different factors relevant to speech-
act-related expressions. Though plan-based
approaches to speech acts such as Allen and
Perrault (1980) are ideal, too little is known in
this field to apply it to actual natural languag(
processing. Therefore, we adopt here a moderate
intrasentential, syntactic method that can servE
as further input to plan-based approaches.
In section 2 of this paper we discuss th(
relation between intention and speech-act
indirectness, and call intention thus describec
&amp;quot;speaker&apos;s meaning.&amp;quot; In section 3 we define IFTs
In section 4 we fully utilize syntactic constraint,
in Japanese in order to extract Ins from input
utterances. In section 5 we present DPs am
strategies for expressing IFTs in the target
language. Finally, we make conclusions on thit
framework.

2.1. What is speaker&apos;s meaning?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957921772727273">
When the speaker utters a sentence, th(
hearer receives communicative signs in additior
to propositional content. According to speech adl
theory, these signs are classified as illocutionar3
forces governed by certain felicity condition!
(Searle 1969). Speech act theory is one of th(
main themes of pragmatics, but it remains to(
conceptual to be of practical assistance to natura
language processing. However, illocutionar3
forces can be useful to machine translation i&apos;
propositional content is distinguished fron
structure in the analysis of intention.
- 264 -
We begin by noting that intentions and
surface expressions have multiple
correspondences. As the following example
shows, a single surface expression can convey
several intentions:
(2-1) gakusei waribiki wa nai no desy6 ha?
student discount TOP exist-NOT EXPL-POL QUEST
Isn&apos;t there a student discount?

</bodyText>

REQUESTING
COMPLAINING
ADVISING
CONFIRMING
...etc.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.951021333333333">
Conversely, the same intention can be conveyed
through various surface expressions, as in the
following variations of (2-1):
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.940436076923077">
REQUESTING

<bodyText confidence="0.954490636363636">
N.I3. Concerning a &apos;discount&apos; request, (2-2) seems a bit
strong for a real situation although there is no specific
contextual condition to decide definitely if it is or not. (2-1)
(2-3) and (2-4) are seen in our data.
These examples clearly show that intention is
context-dependent, and that to understand the
speaker&apos;s meaning correctly, an inference
mechanism is necessary.
Various surface expression patterns give clues
for ascertaining illocutionary forces (Wierzbicka
1986).

<bodyText confidence="0.999126076923077">
Negau in (2-5), a verb for request, and ka, the
sentence-final particle of questions, indicate
request. Kindly in (2-6) signals a request in
English. In other words, even without knowledge
of the context of an utterance, knowledge of
communicative strategies of language and their
expression patterns allow the derivation of
intentions from utterances.
In the above examples, we can see there are
various ways of expressing requests. This
indirectness derives from social patterns in
requesting things common to all cultures to some
degree. On the other hand, however, it depends
on each specific society. In this paper we accept
indirectness as an unavoidable and basic feature
of spoken utterances, and deal with indirect
patterns such in (2-1) and (2-3) that will be called
speech-act indirectness. Indirect expressions such
as (2-4), which are called propositional
indirectness, are not treated for the reason given
in the next subsection. We use the term speaker&apos;s
meaning to refer to intention expressed by
speech-act indirectness. Using this notion, we try
to capture syntactically the major portion of
speech-act-related expressions in spoken
Japanese.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996165">
2.2. Translation of speaker&apos;s meaning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995676">
We assume that for machine translation it is
sufficient to understand utterances on the level of
speech-act indirectness, without referring to
propositional indirectness. On the one hand,
when there is a large degree of indirectness such
as the omission of propositional content in (2-4)
where the topic &amp;quot;discount fee for students&amp;quot; is not
actually mentioned, we must be content with a
direct translation of what has been stated. This is
because a sentence-based translation cannot
compensate for the missing content. In addition,
since the hearer will no doubt be able to infer
something about the omitted content anyway, the
speaker is best served by a direct translation
closest to the original. On the other hand, when
the propositional content is explicitly phrased but
requires indirectness to make an appropriate
translation into the target language, a system
that concentrates on speech-act indirectness will
again be the most useful, because socio-linguistic
differences will be expressed typically in speech-
act indirectness as in (2-1) and (2-3).
Consequently, we develop a framework aimed at
extracting speaker&apos;s meaning in terms of speech-
act indirectness.

An experiment has been carried out on
collected data of spoken-style inter-terminal
dialogues to extract illocutionary acts. The
subject of the conversations was limited to
- 265 -
application for an international conference, and
the content was mainly on inquiry, request, and
confirmation about the conference between a
secretary and an applicant.
We classify surface IFTs into six types (Table
1). This is the immediate result of the analysis
made intrasententially by means of Head-Driven
Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)/Japanese
Phrase Structure Grammar (JPSG). The six
types are differentiated from each other only by
means of the uppermost predicate value that is
the result of the surface-based analysis. For
example, an indirect request with an inter-
rogative sentence pattern such as
(2-5) torohuyosi o o-oleuri negae masu ha?

is classified simply as an INTERROGATIVE
type, though it is OPTATIVE at the deep 1FT

pursue machine translation problems concerning

As a grammar for surface-level analysis, we
have adopted HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987) and
JSPG (Gunji 1987), that is a modification of the
former for dealing with Japanese. On the basis of
a unification parser developed at ATR (Kogure et
al. 1988), the grammar has been written and
proven capable of analyzing all fundamental
sentence patterns in spoken-style Japanese
conversation (Yoshimoto, Kogure and Iida 1989).
This grammar analyzes sentence (3-2) as (3-3)
by means of syntactic rules and lexical
descriptions, of which only those for the
subsidiary verb morau are given as (3-4).

token identity of feature structures. In (3-4), the
third member of the SUBCAT value specifies the
conjugational form and modality type of the
complement verb. The feature MODL imposes
conditions on the modality type that plays a key
role in Japanese syntax by dominating mutual
predicate component subcategorization and
subordination. In order to handle the unordered-
ness of Japanese case phrases, the SUBCAT
value is a set, following JPSG, instead of an
ordered list in the HPSG for English. The set is
expanded by a rule reader into its corresponding
possible ordered list descriptions. Since Japanese
case phrases are always postposed by a case-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997680615384615">
The surface analysis result such as (3-3)
serves as an input to plan schemata called IFT-
Schemata that identify deep IFTs (or merely
WI&apos;s) syntactically by means of predicate-
internal collocation, adjunction, tense, and modal
information. An IFT-Schema consists of a goal
whose value is a partial description of a deep IFT,
and a decomposition whose value is a disjunction
of partial descriptions of surface IFTs,
preconditions, and effects as in (4-1), (4-2) and (4-
3). A surface IFT is searched for which unifies
with one of the descriptions in the decompostion.
The goal in the same schema is the resulting deep
IFT. Adoption of the unification method enables
bi-directional flow of information between the
deep speech act type and the decomposition. This
leads to an easier disambiguation and
supplementation of surface analysis results by
linguistically specifying IFTs (Kogure et a/.
1988).
The difference between surface analyses and
deep IFTs is absorbed by a &amp;quot;thesaurus&amp;quot;, as in (4-
4), that relates the two. This specifies that
MORAU-RECEIVE-FAVOR is a subtype of
RECEIVE-FAVOR. (4-5) is the result of the wr
inference.

In identifying deep IFTs, syntactic constraints
in Japanese are fully utulized.
On the one hand, IFTs SUBJECTIVE and
OPTATIVE are universally limited to
expressions with first person singular subject and
present tense and without modal information,
and Japanese surface predicates reflect them
restrictions very well. Also, OPTATIVE io
limited to second person recipient. For example,

While sentence (4-6) with the present, non-moda
auxiliary tai (want to) belongs to tho
SUBJECTIVE type, (4-7) with the evidentia
modality belongs to the ASSERTIVE type. Thil
fact is utilized, by means of two lexica
descriptions of tai and IFT-Schemata restrictini
the decomposition members&apos; person, tense, an*
modal information, to identify the omitted subjec
of (4-6) as the first person, and that of (4-7) as till
third person.
On the other hand, adverbials that exclusive&apos;:
modify deep IFTs are also utilized it
disambiguating IFTs. For example, a sentenco
with o-negai simasu (request, implore)
ambiguous among OPTATIVE, ASSERTIVE
and PROMISE. If it is modified by dazo (please)
however, the sentence is always an OPTATIVI
type.
Deep Ins with their corresponding syntactil
constraints are diagramed by Table 2. Instance

By so specifying the IFT, information absent
in surface utterances such as zero anaphora are
compensated for and in some cases multiple
analyses are disambiguated. (3-3), the surface
analysis of (3-2), is analyzed as (4-5). This
enables an adequate English translation (4-8)
instead of an inappropriate literal translation (4-

We can summarize the difference between
Japanese and English communication behavior
as follows:
Japanese interpersonal relation is the most
essential factor
English interpersonal relation is
essential, but how to convey or
read intentions is more
important
For example, (5-1) is an utterance from a boss to a
secretary to request him to work overtime. This
Japanese utterance is not an order because it is
expressed in a polite way using the negative
interrogative. This kind of request is not unusual
in Japanese because of the priority given to social
standing. Because Japanese think a request
phrased like this is normal, the English
translation shown in (5-1) using can and sorry
seems appropriate to them, too. But actually an
appropriate translation requires a more polite
expression that addresses the secretary&apos;s
inconvenience, as in (5-1)&apos;. Thus, to get an
appropriate translation of (5-1), we must
reconsider from the viewpoint of the target
language interpersonal relations between the
speaker and the hearer and the inconvenience of
requested action for the hearer.
(5-1) sumanaiga, zangyo site syorui o
sorry work overtime documents OBJ
taipu site kure nai ka na?
type do-ClVFEV NEC QUEST
Sorry, but can you stay late to type these documents?
(5-1)&apos; Do you think you could possibly stay late
to type these documents?
To resolve these communicative differences
between Japanese and English, we assume four
kinds of parameterized factors, which we call
Decision Parameters (DPs). These are:
interpersonal relation, cost-benefit relation,
definiteness of propositional content, and
topicality of propositional content. Interpersonal
relation indicates the situational relationship
between utterance participants as constituted by
age, social status, familiarity, gender, and the
other factors governing use of Japanese
honorifics. Cost-benefit relation indicates
whether the action intended by the speaker&apos;s
utterance is convenient to the speaker or to the
hearer. Definiteness of propositional content
means whether propositional content is routine
or easily performed work, or whether it requires
additional or unusual work. Topicality of
propositional content is related to the position of
an utterance in discourse, which means whether
or not the speaker&apos;s intention is already implied.
Table 4 shows these four parameters and their
values. In particular, DP4 or topicality presents
discourse information which affects the
politeness level of surface expressions. In the
present experimental situation, extraction of
speaker&apos;s meaning is limited to isolated
utterances separate from discourse structure, but
- 269 -
to get appropriate expressions in generation, we
need DP4 in connection with a discourse model.

In the plan inference method of generation, we
use DPs in order to get appropriate English
surface IFTs to convey IFTs in English. Since we
are limiting the input to a task-oriented domain
like conferences, we can re-state input in terms
of propositional content. This propositional
content is then measured in terms of the three DP
values as a default (Table 5).

In business telephone conversations in English, the
hearer is always considered to be in a higher position,
even in the case of a boss to a secretary. So the value of
DPI for (Al is always IIR.
We suppose that differences between Japanese
and English consist in the different amount of
DPs we should refer to when extracting surface
IFTs. Japanese surface IFTs will be concerned
with DP1 and DP2 since Japanese expressions do
not stress speaker&apos;s intention, whereas English
surface IFTs will range over all four DPs and
produce a larger range of appropriate translation
choices.
For example, (1) and (7) of Table 5 which differ
in definiteness of propositional content (i.e.
routine or unusual), can be generated in the same
way in Japanese, which involves only DP1 and
DP2. That is,

In English, however, these propositional contents
will be generated in different expressions. In case

&apos;picking up&apos; request, an adequate expression
requires more politeness.

With reference to discourse information, DP4,
the appropiate English surface IFT will be graded
up or down depending on its position in the
discourse. The mapping from Japanese surface
IFT to English surface IFT is schematized as in
Table 6. We can categorize English request
expressions into two kinds. One is direct
expressions with please, which we call PLEASE,
and others are expressions containing several
levels of politeness such as could you...?, is it
possible to...?, lam wondering, etc., which we call
PLEASE-PLUS. Japanese surface IFTs are
separated into two types, INTERROGATIVE and
others, i.e. declarative requests using
OPTATIVE, SUBJECTIVE or ASSERTIVE type.
When a Japanese surface IFT is
INTERROGATIVE as in (5-4) and (5-5), and if
the IFT is already implied in preceding
utterances, the English surface IFT can be
- 270 -
expressed simply with PLEASE type as in (5-4)&apos;
and (5-5)&apos;, otherwise it should be expressed in
PLEASE-PLUS type such as several kinds of
English speech-act indirectness as in (5-4)&amp;quot; and
(5-5)&amp;quot;. On the other hand, when the Japanese
surface IFT is others such as OPTATIVE or
SUBJECTIVE as in (5-2) and (5-3), and if IFT is
already implied in preceding utterances, the
English surface IFT should be expressed in
PLEASE-PLUS as in (5-2)&amp;quot; and (5-3)&amp;quot;.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999886333333333">
We proposed in this paper a descriptive
framework for translating speaker&apos;s meaning in a
dialogue translation system. This framework is
based on two notions, Illocutionary Force types
and Decision Parameters, and is aimed at
extracting speaker&apos;s meaning in terms of speech-
act indirectness since we believe that
propositional and speech-act indirectness must
both be processed separately.

<abstract confidence="0.99796775">A framework for translating speaker&apos;s meaning or intention is proposed based on two notions, Illocutionary Force Types (IFTs) for analysis and Decision Parameters (DPs) for generation. IFTs are a certain kind of classification of utterances concerning speaker&apos;s meaning. DPs present background information of language use in order to derive an appropriate expression from speaker&apos;s meaning. In Japanese, IFTs can be derived automatically through syntactical constraints. To generate appropriate expressions, language-specific communication strategies related to DP values should be given a priori. The whole process is performed in a unification-based framework.</abstract>

The whole process is performed in a unification-based framework. 1. Introduction In devising a machine translation system of telephone dialogues, one of the problems is how to adequately translate the underlying meaning of the source utterance, or the speaker&apos;s intention, into the target language. Such a concern is rarely observed in conventional machine translation research, which has focused on strictly grammatical translation divorced from consideration of the speaker&apos;s situation and intentions (Tsujii and Nagao 1988). However, in dialogue, smoothness of communication depends on perceiving the speaker&apos;s intention. Especially when dealing with different language family pairs such as Japanese and English, it is necessary to have a methodology of treating language-specific communication strategies in a universal framework. Although the input of our machine translation system is spoken dialogue, here we leave aside the issues of speech processing and limit our discussion to linguistic processing.
