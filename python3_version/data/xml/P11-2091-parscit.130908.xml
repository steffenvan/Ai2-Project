The number of users on Twitter has drasti-
cally increased in the past years. However,
Twitter does not have an effective user group-
ing mechanism. Therefore tweets from other
users can quickly overrun and become in-
convenient to read. In this paper, we pro-
pose methods to help users group the peo-
ple they follow using their provided seeding
users. Two sources of information are used to
build sub-systems: textural information cap-
tured by the tweets sent by users, and social
connections among users. We also propose
a measure of fitness to determine which sub-
system best represents the seed users and use
it for target user ranking. Our experiments
show that our proposed framework works well
and that adaptively choosing the appropriate
sub-system for group suggestion results in in-
creased accuracy.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999984804347826">
Twitter is a well-known social network service that
allows users to post short 140 character status update
which is called “Tweet”. A twitter user can “follow”
other users to get their latest updates. Twitter cur-
rently has 19 million active users. These users fol-
lows 80 other users on average. Default Twitter ser-
vice displays “Tweets” in the order of their times-
tamps. It works well when the number of tweets
the user receives is not very large. However, the
flat timeline becomes tedious to read even for av-
erage users with less than 80 friends. As Twitter
service grows more popular in the past few years,
users’ “following” list starts to consist of Twitter ac-
counts for different purposes. Take an average user
“Bob” for example. Some people he follows are his
“Colleagues”, some are “Technology Related Peo-
ple”, and others could be “TV show comedians”.
When Bob wants to read the latest news from his
“Colleagues”, because of lacking effective ways to
group users, he has to scroll through all “Tweets”
from other users. There have been suggestions from
many Twitter users that a grouping feature could be
very useful. Yet, the only way to create groups is
to create “lists” of users in Twitter manually by se-
lecting each individual user. This process is tedious
and could be sometimes formidable when a user is
following many people.
In this paper, we propose an interactive group cre-
ating system for Twitter. A user creates a group by
first providing a small number of seeding users, then
the system ranks the friend list according to how
likely a user belongs to the group indicated by the
seeds. We know in the real world, users like to group
their “follows” in many ways. For example, some
may create groups containing all the “computer sci-
entists”, others might create groups containing their
real-life friends. A system using “social informa-
tion” to find friend groups may work well in the lat-
ter case, but might not effectively suggest correct
group members in the former case. On the other
hand, a system using “textual information” may be
effective in the first case, but is probably weak in
finding friends in the second case. Therefore in
this paper, we propose to use multiple information
sources for group member suggestions, and use a
cross-validation approach to find the best-fit sub-

There is no previous research on interactive sug-
gestion of friend groups on Twitter to our knowl-
edge; however, some prior work is related and can
help our task. (Roth et al., 2010) uses implicit so-
cial graphs to help suggest email addresses a person
is likely to send to based on the addresses already
entered. Also, using the social network informa-
tion, hidden community detection algorithms such
as (Palla et al., 2005) can help suggest friend groups.
Besides the social information, what a user tweets is
also a good indicator to group users. To character-
ize users’ tweeting style, (Ramage et al., 2010) used
semi-supervised topic modeling to map each user’s
tweets into four characteristic dimensions.

3 Interactive Group Creation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99978425">
Creating groups manually is a tedious process.
However, creating groups in an entirely un-
supervised fashion could result in unwanted results.
In our system, a user first indicates a small number
of users that belong to a group, called “seeds”, then
the system suggests other users that might belong to
this group. The general structure of the system is
shown in Figure 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.99993952">
As mentioned earlier, we use different informa-
tion sources to determine user/group similarity, in-
cluding textual information and social connections.
A module is designed for each information source to
rank users based on their similarity to the provided
seeds. In our approach, the system first tries to detect
what sub-system can best fit the seed group. Then,
the corresponding system is used to generate the fi-
nal ranked list of users according to the likelihood of
belonging to the group.
After the rank list is given, the user can adjust the
size of the group to best fit his/her needs. In addition,
a user can correct the system by specifically indicat-
ing someone as a “negative seed”, which should not
be on the top of the list. In this paper, we only con-
sider creating one group at a time with only “positive
seed” and do not consider the relationships between
different groups.
Since determining the best fitting sub-system or
the group type from the seeds needs the use of the
two sub-systems, we describe them first. Each sub-
system takes a group of seed users and unlabeled
target users as the input, and provides a ranked list
of the target users belonging to the group indicated
by the seeds.

<bodyText confidence="0.999992727272727">
In this sub-system, user groups are modeled using
the textual information contained in their tweets. We
collected all the tweets from a user and grouped
them together.
To represent the tweets information, we could use
a bag-of-word model for each user. However, since
Twitter messages are known to be short and noisy,
it is very likely that traditional natural language pro-
cessing methods will perform poorly. Topic mod-
eling approaches, such as Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), model document as a
mixture of multinomial distribution of words, called
topics. They can reduce the dimension and group
words with similar semantics, and are often more
robust in face of data sparsity or noisy data. Be-
cause tweet messages are very short and hard to infer
topics directly from them, we merge all the tweets
from a user to form a larger document. Then LDA
is applied to the collection of documents from all
the users to derive the topics. Each user’s tweets
can then be represented using a bag-of-topics model,
where the ith component is the proportion of the ith

Given a group of seed users, we want to find target
users that are similar to the seeds in terms of their
tweet content. To take multiple seed instances into
consideration, we use two schemes to calculate the
similarity between one target user and a seed group.

this sub-system models the real-life friend groups,
we only consider bi-directional following relation

between users when both of them follow each other.

ified list (more than 20 and less than 200 list mem-

After applying these filtering criteria, we found 87

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999386681818182">
In our experiment, we evaluate the performance of
each sub-system and then use group type detection
algorithm to adaptively combine the systems. We
use the Twitter lists we collected as the reference
user groups for evaluation. For each user group, we
randomly take out 6 users from the list and use as
seed candidate. The target user consists of the rest of
the list members and other “friends” that the list cre-
ator has. From the ranked list for the target users, we
calculate the mean average precision (MAP) score
with the rank position of the list members. For each
group, we run the experiment 10 times using ran-
domly selected seeds. Then the average MAP on all
runs on all groups is reported. In order to evaluate
the effect of the seed size on the final performance,
we vary the number of seeds from 2 to 6 using the 6
taken-out list members.
In the tweet based sub-system, we optimize its hy-
per parameter automatically based on the data. After
trying different numbers of topics in LDA, we found
optimal performance with 50 topics (α = 0.5 and
Q = 0.04).

Table 1 shows the performance of each sub-
system as well as the adaptive system. We include
the baseline results generated using random ranking.
As a stronger baseline (BOW baseline), we used co-
sine similarity between users’ tweets as the similar-
ity measure. In this baseline, we used a vocabulary
of 5000 words that have the highest TF-IDF values.
Each user’s tweet content is represented using a bag-
of-words vector using this vocabulary. The ranking
of this baseline is calculated using the average simi-
larity with the seeds.
In the tweet-based sub-system, “Cos” and “Euc”
mean cosine similarity and inverse Euclidean dis-
tance respectively as the similarity measure. “Cent”
and “Avg” mean using centroid vector and average
similarity respectively to measure the similarities
between a target user and the seed group. From the
results, we can see that in general using a larger seed
group improves performance since more informa-
tion can be obtained from the group. The “CosAvg”
scheme (which uses cosine similarity with average
similarity measure) achieves the best result. Using
cosine similarity measure gives better performance
than inverse Euclidean distance. This is not surpris-
ing since cosine similarity has been widely adopted
as an appropriate similarity measure in the vector
space model for text processing. The bag-of-word
baseline is much better than the random baseline;
however, using LDA topic modeling to collapse the
dimension of features achieves even better results.
This confirms that topic modeling is very useful in
representing noisy data, such as tweets.
In the adaptive system, we also used “CosAvg”
scheme in the tweet based sub-system. After the au-
tomatic sub-system selection, we observe increased
performance. This indicates that users form lists
based on different factors and thus always using
one single system is not the best solution. It also
demonstrates that our proposed fitness measure us-
ing cross-validation works well, and that the two in-
formation sources used to build sub-systems can ap-
propriately capture the group characteristics.

We introduced two sub-systems, based on tweet text

posed a group type detection procedure that is able
to use the most appropriate system for group user
ranking. Our experiments show that by using differ-
ent systems adaptively, better performance can be
achieved compared to using any single system, sug-
gesting this framework works well. In the future, we
plan to add more sophisticated sub-systems in this
framework, and also explore combining ranking out-
puts from different sub-systems. Furthermore, we
will incorporate negative seeds into the process of
interactive suggestion.

(Roth et al., 2010) uses implicit social graphs to help suggest email addresses a person is likely to send to based on the addresses already entered. Also, using the social network information, hidden community detection algorithms such as (Palla et al., 2005) can help suggest friend groups. Besides the social information, what a user tweets is also a good indicator to group users. To characterize users’ tweeting style, (Ramage et al., 2010) used semi-supervised topic modeling to map each user’s tweets into four characteristic dimensions. 3 Interactive Group Creation Creating groups manually is a tedious process. However, creating groups in an entirely unsupervised fashion could result in unwanted results. In our system, a user first indicates a small number of users that belong to a group, called “seeds”, then the system suggests other users that might belong to this group. The general structure of the system is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Overview of the system architecture As mentioned earlier, we use different information so</context>

Our results show that automatic group suggestion is feasible and that selecting approximate sub-system yields additional gain than using individual systems. 2 Related Work There is no previous research on interactive suggestion of friend groups on Twitter to our knowledge; however, some prior work is related and can help our task.
