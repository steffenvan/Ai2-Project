<bodyText confidence="0.9998472">
This paper addresses an unsupervised learning
method which acquires knowledge about the
deletion possibility of adnominal verb phrases
from corpus. Actually, our method deletes an
adnominal verb phrase with which the noun
modified by the phrase can be associated eas-
ily. Experimental results show that our method
is able to delete adnominal verb phrases appro-
priately, as the precision and the recall attain
79.3% and 72.7%, respectively.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936604651163">
Recent rapid progress of computer and com-
munication technologies enabled us to access
enormous amount of machine-readable infor-
mation easily. This, however, has caused so
called the information overload problem. Under
these circumstances, the necessity for automatic
summarization has been increasing and has
been intensively studied recently (see e.g,(Mani
and T.Maybury, 1999)). No all-purpose au-
tomatic summarization method for summariz-
ing any type of documents appropriately exists,
thus, in many cases, we must combine several
summarization methods as components when
we develop an automatic summarization sys-
tem. Deletion of some unnecessary parts from a
sentence is among such important summariza-
tion methods(Yamamoto et al., 1995)(Jing and
McKeown, 2000).
In this paper, we propose an unsupervised
learning method which acquires knowledge
about the deletion possibility of adnominal verb
phrases in order to summarize a document by
deleting unimportant segments from a sentence
in the document. As a method of summariza-
tion which deletes unimportant segments from
a sentence, Ohtake et al.(Ohtake et al., 2001)
proposes a method which deletes one of double
modification segments modifying the same noun
by using manually constructed rules. Knight
et al.(Knight and Marcu, 2000) and Jing(Jing,
2000) and Takeuchi et al. (Takeuchi and Mat-
sumoto, 2001) propose methods which extract
rules for reducing a sentence from aligned cor-
pus of human-made summaries and their orig-
inal manuscripts. As for such application of
supervised learning using aligned corpus, Ka-
toh et al.(Katoh and Uratani, 1999) proposes a
method which acquires knowledge about para-
phrasing by using an aligned corpus of captions
and original manuscripts which correspond to
the captions. However, these previously pro-
posed methods have the following drawbacks for
practical use.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.811605555555555">
• To make a complete list of rules manually
in order to delete unimportant segments
from a sentence is a hard task.
• Aligned corpus between original
manuscripts and summaries is useful. But
it is not necessarily available. Moreover,
constructing summaries manually for ob-
taining such aligned corpus is a time-
consuming and costly task.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993262">
By these reasons, we propose an unsuper-
vised learning method which acquires knowl-
edge from general corpus (e.g., news paper ar-
ticles), about the deletion possibility of ad-
nominal verb phrases to summarize by delet-
ing unimportant segments from a sentence. We
define, in this paper, adnominal verb phrases
as phrases which modify a noun and include a
verb modifying the noun. An example is shown
as follows.

The method proposed by Ohtake et al.(Ohtake
et al., 2001) deletes one of double adnominal
modification expressions which are part of noun
phrases by using manually-constructed rules.
The method can only apply to sentences hav-
ing structures matching the rules. In contrast,
our method deletes adnominal verb phrases hav-
ing unimportant contents by using statistical in-
formation obtained from single corpus. Conse-
quently, more flexibility in deletion of adnomi-
nal verb phrases is attained.
Our method extracts knowledge about dele-
tion of adnominal verb phrases from general
corpus, e.g., news paper articles provided as
a machine-readable form, documents obtained
from WWW which are easily available.
We introduce our method in Sec. 2 and its
implementation and experiments for evaluation
are illustrated in Secs. 3 and 4, respectively. We
analyze the results of the experiments in Sec. 5.
Sec. 6 concludes this paper.

2 Proposed method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999345571428571">
Our method is based on an intuition that ad-
nominal verb phrases with which the modified
noun is easily associated can be deleted. Here,
an adnominal verb phrase is a phrase which
modifies a noun and includes a verb modifying
the noun (see Example 1). Among such adnom-
inal verb phrases we consider, in this method,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9996265">
• those modifying nouns not frequently mod-
ified by adnominal verb phrases and modi-
fied by only a few kinds of verbs,
• those modifying nouns having important
contents,
• those having important contents.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996675">
Adnominal verb phrases modifying nouns not
frequently modified by verbs and modified by
only a few kinds of verbs can be deleted, as it
is easy to associate such a noun with adnomi-
nal verb phrases modifying the noun and then
deletion does not cause serious information loss.
Our method gets, for each noun, &amp;quot;frequency
of modification of the noun by adnominal verb
phrases&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;variety of adnominal verb phrases
modifying the noun&amp;quot; etc., from news paper cor-
pus provided as a machine-readable form, and
acquires knowledge for deleting adnominal verb
phrases by using their statistical information.
In order to reflect &amp;quot;frequency of modification of
the noun by adnominal verb phrases&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;va-
riety of adnominal verb phrases modifying the
noun&amp;quot;, the entropy based on a probability of
verbs to modify noun is employed. And, adnom-
inal verb phrases modifying nouns which have
large entropy are deleted by our method.
Adnominal verb phrases modifying nouns
having important contents can be deleted, as
meaning of such a noun is understood only by
the noun itself, and then deletion of modifier
does not cause serious information loss. Our
method deletes adnominal verb phrases modify-
ing nouns having important contents. In order
to measure the importance of the content of a
noun, we use idf (Salton, 1988) method. And,
the adnominal verb phrases modifying nouns
with large idf value (the nouns have important
contents) are deleted.
We regard an adnominal verb phrase has im-
portant contents when
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.938018571428571">
• it has nouns having large idf value,
• it has nouns appearing in some sentence
after its position in the documents.
On the other hand, the importance of an ad-
nominal verb phrase is reduced when
• it has nouns appearing in some sentence
before its position in the documents.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999902666666667">
The adnominal verb phrases having impor-
tant contents and having noun appearing af-
ter its position in the documents tend not to
be deleted. On the other hand, the adnominal
verb phrases having noun appearing before its
position in the documents tend to be deleted.

2.1 Algorithm to delete adnominal
verb phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.92893725">
Based on the above observations, our method
of deleting adnominal verb phrases is defined as
follows:
Algorithm to delete adnominal verb
phrases
Step 1: Weight value W(VP(v, n)) of adnom-
inal verb phrase VP(v, n) is calculated by
the following expression (1):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999228333333333">
, , E(1(n)) x M (V P(v,n))
W (V P(1),n11&apos; idf(n) x J(n)
x (1 + C R(V P(v, n))), (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.988642220930233">
where
VP(v, n): an adnominal verb phrase hav-
ing verb v modifying noun n,
1(n): a noun contained at the end of com-
pound noun n modified by adnominal
verb phrases,
E(1(n)): entropy based on the probability
that verbs modify noun 1(n), which
will be defined by expression (3).
idf(n): weight value calculated by the idf
(Salton, 1988) method to increase the
weight value of noun n dispersed in the
document set. This is defined by the
following expression (2).
where
D: the set of general documents used
to acquire knowledge about the
deletion possibility of adnominal
verb phrases,
df (n): frequency of documents con-
taining noun n in documents set D,
J(n): the number of nouns contained in
compound noun n,
M(VP(v, n)): the number of verb phrases
modifying verb v,
CR (VP(v, n)): a factor to reflect context
of the document. This will be ex-
plained in subsection 2.3.
Step 2:
Delete adnominal verb phrase VP(v, n)
having weight value W(VP(v, n)) smaller
than a threshold value predetermined by
trial and error.
0
W(VP(v, n)) shows degree of importance
of adnominal verb phrase VP(v, n) and if
W(VP(v, n)) is large, VP(v, n) is not able to
be deleted.
For example, 1(n) is &amp;quot;Tougou(14`1-: unifica-
tion)&amp;quot;, when noun n is &amp;quot;Shijo Tougou(M 1-:
market unification)&amp;quot;. (The &amp;quot;Shijo Tougou(M
market unification)&amp;quot; is a compound noun
composed of a noun:&amp;quot;Shijo(M: market)&amp;quot; and
a noun:&amp;quot; Tougou(-: unification)&amp;quot;)
Entropy E (1(n)) reflects &amp;quot;frequency of modifi-
cation of noun 1(n) by adnominal verb phrases&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;variety of adnominal verb phrases modi-
fying noun 1(n)&amp;quot;. By our method, &amp;quot;frequency
of modification of noun 1(n) by adnominal
verb phrases&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;variety of adnominal verb
phrases modifying noun 1(n)&amp;quot; is expressed by
the entropy based on a probability that verbs
modify noun 1(n). Entropy E(1(n)) has a large
value if noun 1(n) is modified by various kinds of
verbs. The verbs modified by noun 1(n) having
a large entropy value can not be predicted eas-
ily. Similarly, it is hard to associate noun 1(n)
having a large entropy value with an adnomi-
nal verb phrase modifying noun 1(n). Informa-
tion loss may become serious if such adnominal
verb phrases modifying noun 1(n) having a large
entropy value are deleted. Hence, the adnom-
inal verb phrases modifying noun 1(n) having
a large entropy value are not deleted, because
weight value W(VP(v, n)) increases as E(1(n))
increases. But, it is easy to associate noun 1(n)
having a small entropy value with an adnom-
inal verb phrase modifying noun 1(n). Con-
sequently, the adnominal verb phrases modify-
ing noun 1(n) having a small entropy value are
deleted, because weight value W(VP(v, n)) de-
creases as E(1(n)) decreases. We will illustrate
the entropy based on a probability that verbs
modify a noun in subsection 2.2.
Noun n with a large idf(n) value is important.
Deletion of the adnominal verb phrases modify-
ing noun n with a large idf(n) value does not
cause serious information loss, because meaning
of such noun n is understood without any mod-
ifier. Thus, the adnominal verb phrases modify-
ing noun n with a large idf(n) value are deleted
because weight value W(VP(v, n)) decreases as
idf(n) increases.
For example, when n is &amp;quot;Shijo Tougou(M
market unification)&amp;quot;, J(n) = 2. If noun
n is not compound noun, J(n) = 1. If noun n

(2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999227181818182">
is compound noun, deletion of adnominal verb
phrases modifying noun n does not cause serious
information loss, because meaning of noun n is
understood only by noun n. Thus, it is easy to
delete adnominal verb phrases modifying such
noun n, because weight value W(VP(v,n)) de-
creases as J(n) increases.
M(VP(v,n)) is the number of verb phrases
modifying verb v, which is contained in adnom-
inal verb phrase VP(v, n). M(VP(v,n)) is il-
lustrated in the following example.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.757269428571429">
Example 2:
Adnominal verb phrase VP(v, n): Koremade EC

Verb v: bundansuru (1331*--4-6: divide),
Verb phrase 1: koremade (L-Ail-e: so far),
Verb phrase 2: EC shijo (E CfritZ: EC market).
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986043">
Value M(VP(v,n)) for this example is 2. If
the adnominal verb phrase VP(v, n) has a large
M(VP(v,n)) value, the VP(v, n) has much in-
formation. Information loss may become serious
if such adnominal verb phrase VP(v, n) having
a large M(VP(v,n)) value is deleted. Conse-
quently, the adnominal verb phrase VP(v, n)
with a large M(VP(v,n)) value is not deleted
because weight value W(VP(v,n)) increases as
M(VP(v,n)) increases.

CR(VP(v, n)) has small value if noun p is

2.4 Constraints on deletion for
improving precision
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978481703703704">
We impose the following constraints on deletion
for improving precision.
Constraint 1: Adnominal verb phrases where
CR(VP(v,n)) = 1 are not able to be
deleted.
Constraint 2: if adnominal verb phrase
VP(v1, n1) contains a first noun modi-
fied by another adnominal verb phrase
VP(v2, n2) in VP(v1, n1), VP(v1, n1) is
not able to be deleted.
Constraint 3: Adnominal verb phrases modi-
fying a noun listed in Table 1, are not able
to be deleted.
The case of CR(VP(v,n)) = 1 occurs when an
adnominal verb phrase has no noun. If an ad-
nominal verb phrase having no noun is deleted,
the cohesion among sentences may be destroyed.
Thus, we impose Constraint 1.
The reason why we impose Constraint 2 is to
prevent excessive deletion. That is, without this
constraint, if adnominal verb phrase VP(v1, n1)
is deleted, the VP(v2, n2) must be also deleted.
Nouns having no substantial meaning, e.g.,
the nouns listed in Table 1, is used for Con-
straint 3. Note that some Japanese nouns in
the table do not correspond to English nouns
when translated.

Next, we calculate the average of reduction
rate which results from the deletion of adnomi-

the reduction rate Rrate is defined as follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.9672391875">
We consider that our method is able to delete
adnominal verb phrases appropriately, because
the precision and the recall attain 79.3% and
72.7%, respectively. And we conclude that
Method A is superior to Method B, because the
precision of Method A is higher than that of
Method B. Experimental results show that our
method is useful for deleting adnominal verb
phrases.
Moreover, we conclude that CR(VP(v, n)) is
useful for this task, because the precision and
the recall of Method A are higher than those of
Method C. The correct adnominal verb phrase
deleted by our method is as follows.
Example 5: Kantan ni rokuga yoyaku ga dekiru
koudo naizou gata no VTR wo tounyuu site iru
(ftVi:Nail-gtW--e- 6 G-1,&apos;PWftlo&apos;DVTR
: G code built-in type VTR which is
able to reserve videotape-recording is thrown in...)
The adnominal verb phrase: &amp;quot;Kantan ni rokuga
yoyaku ga dekiru(it 7-- a T 6 : be
able to reserve videotape-recording)&amp;quot; modify-
ing the noun &amp;quot;G koudo naizou(G
G code built-in)&amp;quot; is deleted by our method.
We consider that this adnominal verb phrase
is able to be deleted, because we can easily
supplement the &amp;quot;Kantan ni rokuga yoyaku ga
dekiru(it*LaLdi T 6 : be able to re-
serve videotape-recording)&amp;quot; from general knowl-
edge. The reason why our method deletes it
is that the weight value of &amp;quot;Kantan ni rokuga
yoyaku ga dekiru(it 7-- a T 6 : be
able to reserve videotape-recording)&amp;quot; is small,
because the entropy value of noun &amp;quot;naizou( PJ):
built-in)&amp;quot; is small. (The entropy value of noun
&amp;quot;naizou(JO: built-in)&amp;quot; is 0.693. In contrast,
the entropy value of noun &amp;quot;an(: plan)&amp;quot; is
4.13.) The noun &amp;quot;naizou(114-: built-in)&amp;quot; is sel-
dom modified by adnominal verb phrases. Con-
sequently, the entropy value of noun &amp;quot;naizou( PJ
built-in)&amp;quot; is small. It is easy to associate a
noun having a small entropy value with an ad-
nominal verb phrase modifying the noun. Thus,
the adnominal verb phrases modifying the noun
having a small entropy value are deleted.
The incorrect deletion of an adnominal verb
phrase by our method is illustrated in the fol-
lowing example.

We consider that the adnominal verb phrase
&amp;quot;kokunai, kokugai no hantai de tsuburetekita( II
,LI 51- 0-) L: have been
crushed by objection from the domestic and for-
eign people)&amp;quot; is not able to be deleted, because
the noun &amp;quot;ikisatsu(lt\ -0: circumstances)&amp;quot;
has no substantial meaning. However, the noun
&amp;quot;ikisatsu(lt\ -0: circumstances)&amp;quot; is recog-
nized as an important noun by our method,
because the noun &amp;quot;ikisatsu(lt\ -0: circum-
stances)&amp;quot; has a large idf value. Hence, the
weight value of this adnominal verb phrase is
small, and it is deleted by our method. If a
noun &amp;quot;keii(na: circumstances)&amp;quot; which has the
same meaning with &amp;quot;ikisatsu(lt\ -0: circum-
stances)&amp;quot; is modified by the adnominal verb
phrase, the adnominal verb phrase may not be
deleted. Because the noun &amp;quot;keii(na: circum-
stances)&amp;quot; has a small idf value and has a large
entropy value. (The entropy value of noun &amp;quot;ik-
isatsu(lt\ : circumstances)&amp;quot; is 1.61. On
the other hand, the entropy value of noun
&amp;quot;keii(na: circumstances)&amp;quot; is 4.17. ) We con-
sider that this problem is solvable by adding
constraint that if a noun &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; with a similar
meaning of a noun &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;to which our method is
applied exists and noun &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; has a small idf
value and a large entropy value. The adnom-
inal verb phrase modified by noun &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; is not
deleted.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999824266666667">
We proposed an unsupervised learning method
which acquires knowledge about the deletion
possibility of adnominal verb phrases from news
paper corpus provided in a machine-readable
form in order to summarize by deleting unim-
portant segment from a sentence. Actually, our
method deletes adnominal verb phrases modify-
ing nouns not frequently modified by verbs, not
modified by many kinds of verbs. We evaluate
our method, and we conclude that our method is
able to delete adnominal verb phrases appropri-
ately, because the precision and the recall attain
79.3% and 72.7%, respectively. Experimental
results show that our method is useful to delete
adnominal verb phrases.
