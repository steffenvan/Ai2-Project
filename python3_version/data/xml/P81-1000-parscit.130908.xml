This volume is the official record of the proceedings of the 19th
Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,
held on the campus of Stanford University, from June 29 to July
1, 1981. It contains both the refereed papers presented at the
meeting and the position statements of the participants to the
two invited panels, the first on the evaluation of natural
language interfaces to databases, and the second on parsing.
The conference is the result of the efforts of many individuals
and institutions, all of whom get my thanks and those of the
Association. The program committee consisted of Chip Bruce,
Jaime Carbonell, Mitch Marcus, Ellen Prince, Ralph Weischedel,
and myself. Jane Robinson and Norman Sondheimer organized the
panels. Norman also oversaw the production of these proceedings.
Jerry Kaplan handled the local arrangements. Don Walker produced
the Call for Papers and the Advanced Program, and was always
available to make sure the rest of us didn&apos;t forget what to do
next.
I could never have undertaken to be program chairman without the
support I received from my hosts, SRI International and Bolt
Beranek and Newman, Inc., while I was on sabbatical from the
University of Toronto. My special thanks go to Jane Perry of SRI
and Beverly Tobiason of BBN for their secretarial assistance.
Financial assistance came from several sources. SRI
International produced the Call for Papers and the Advanced
Program. Bolt Beranek and Newman provided secretarial support to
the program committee. Sperry Univac produced the proceedings.
The Department of Computer Science at Stanford provided support
for the local arrangements.
Most importantly, thanks to all who took the time to write and
submit papers. Particular thanks go to those whose submissions
could not be accommodated in our limited schedule. Finally,
thanks to those who in these days of soaring transportation costs
attended the meeting. You make it all worthwhile.
