<bodyText confidence="0.999924545454546">
We present the new THOT toolkit for fully-
automatic and interactive statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT). Initial public ver-
sions of THOT date back to 2005 and did
only include estimation of phrase-based
models. By contrast, the new version of-
fers several new features that had not been
previously incorporated. The key innova-
tions provided by the toolkit are computer-
aided translation, including post-editing
and interactive SMT, incremental learn-
ing and robust generation of alignments
at phrase level. In addition to this, the
toolkit also provides standard SMT fea-
tures such as fully-automatic translation,
scalable and parallel algorithms for model
training, client-server implementation of
the translation functionality, etc. The
toolkit can be compiled in Unix-like and
Windows platforms and it is released un-
der the GNU Lesser General Public Li-
cense (LGPL).

<bodyText confidence="0.999921933333333">
Open-source software constitutes a valuable re-
source for researchers or companies. Due to the
inherent difficulties of developing good quality
software (correct, efficient, modular, extensible,
well-documented, etc.), there are interesting re-
search ideas that not always receive enough atten-
tion from the open-source software community.
We present the THOT toolkit for statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT). The first public version
of THOT was initially created in 2005 (Ortiz et
al., 2005) and its functionality was restricted to
train phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003).
Here we present a new version of THOT which
includes several new features related to phrase-
based translation. More specifically, the set of fea-

tures provided by THOT can be classified into ad-
vanced features and standard features. Advanced
features correspond to sophisticated functionality
that has received poor or no attention in existing
SMT toolkits. By contrast, standard features cor-
respond to functionality already provided by pop-
ular tools such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). In
this regard, THOT neither is based on Moses nor
shares any source code with it.
THOT includes the following advanced features:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9981898">
• Computer-aided translation, including post-
editing and interactive machine translation
(IMT). This functionality has been inte-
grated in a translation tool developed in the
CasMaCat project1 (the so-called CasMaCat
Workbench).
• Incremental estimation of all of the models
involved in the translation process.
• Robust generation of phrase-based align-
ments.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9979160625">
Computer-aided translation and more specifi-
cally two of its applications, post-editing and IMT,
constitute a field of increasing interest in SMT. In
particular, IMT has been studied in numerous re-
search papers during the last years. In spite of
this, this application has not previously been im-
plemented in open-source software tools.
Incremental (or online) learning is a hot re-
search topic in SMT due to the great interest of
quickly incorporating incoming data into exist-
ing translation systems. In spite of the fact that
the Moses toolkit already implements incremental
learning techniques, such techniques are designed
to work by incrementally processing large blocks
of data and not in a sentence-wise manner, as it is
pointed out in (Mirking and Cancedda, 2013). By

contrast, the incremental learning techniques im-
plemented by THOT allows to process new train-
ing samples individually in real time.
Finally, the necessity of generating phrase-level
alignments is present in a wide range of tasks,
from multisource SMT to discriminative training.
However, as far as we know this functionality also
is not included in existing SMT tools.
In addition to the above mentioned advanced
features, THOT offers a set of standard features:

2 The THOT toolkit
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976268">
THOT can be downloaded from GitHub2 and is
distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL). It has been developed using C++
and shell scripting. The design principles that have
led the development process were:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.877826863636364">
• Modularity: The THOT code is organised
into separate packages for each main func-
tional component (training of phrase-based
and language models, decoding, etc.). Each
component can be treated as a stand-alone
tool and does not rely on the rest of the code.
• Extensibility: The functionality provided by
each package is structured into classes. Ab-
stract classes are used when appropriate to
define the basic behaviour of the functional
components of the toolkit, allowing us to eas-
ily extend the toolkit functionality.
• Scalability: THOT is able to train statisti-
cal models from corpora of an arbitrary size.
Moreover, the toolkit takes advantage of par-
allel and distributed computing to reduce the
time cost of the implemented algorithms. Ad-
ditionally, the parameters of the resulting
models can be pruned or accessed from disk
during the decoding process.
• Portability: It is known to compile on Unix-
like and Windows (using Cygwin) systems.

In the rest of the paper we give additional details
about the different toolkit features that have been
mentioned above.

3 Computer-Aided Translation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907583333333">
Current MT systems are not able to produce ready-
to-use texts. Indeed, they usually require hu-
man post-editing in order to achieve high-quality
translations. This motivates an alternative applica-
tion of MT in which the MT system collaborates
with the user to generate the output translations.
This alternative application receives the name of
computer-assisted translation (CAT).
CAT can be instantiated in different ways. The
THOT toolkit incorporates tools that are useful
in two different CAT instantations, namely, post-
editing and interactive machine translation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999415">
3.1 Post-Editing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998216">
Post-editing (PE) involves making corrections and
amendments to machine generated translations
(see (TAUS, 2010) for a detailed study). In the
PE scenario, the user only edits the output of the
MT system without further system intervention.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980151">
3.2 Interactive Machine Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999302965517241">
In the IMT framework (Foster et al., 1997;
Langlais et al., 2002), the user obtains her desired
translations in a series of interactions with an MT
system. Specifically, the system initially generates
a translation without human intervention and af-
ter that, the user validates a prefix of the transla-
tion and introduce the next correct character of it.
With this information, the IMT system returns the
suffix which best completes the user prefix. This
process is repeated until the user gets the sentence
she has in mind. In (Barrachina et al., 2009), SMT
techniques were embedded within the interactive
translation environment.
A common problem in IMT arises when the
user sets a prefix which cannot be explained by the
statistical models. This problem requires the in-
troduction of specific techniques to guarantee that
the suffixes can be generated. The majority of the
IMT systems described in the literature use error-
correcting techniques based on the concept of edit
distance to solve the coverage problems. Such
error-correction techniques, although they are not
included in the statistical formulation of the IMT
process, are crucial to ensure that the suffixes com-
pleting the user prefixes can be generated.
THOT implements an alternative formalisation
that introduces stochastic error-correction models
in the IMT statistical formulation. Such a formal-
isation was introduced in (Ortiz-Martinez, 2011)
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996897">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999557181818182">
and it generates the suffixes required in IMT by
partially aligning a prefix of the target hypotheses
with the user prefix. Once the partial alignment
is determined, the suffix is given by the unaligned
portion of the target sentence.
Experiments to test the above mentioned IMT
proposal were carried out using THOT. The re-
sults showed that the proposed IMT system out-
performs the results of other state-of-the-start IMT
systems that are based on word graphs (see (Ortiz-
Martinez, 2011) for more details).

3.3 Integration with the CasMaCat
Workbench

THOT can be combined with the CasMaCat Work-
bench3 that is being developed within the project
of the same name. The CasMaCat Workbench of-
fers novel types of assistance for human transla-
tors, using advanced computer aided translation
technology that includes PE and IMT.

4 Incremental Learning for SMT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982681818182">
Thot incorporates techniques to incrementally up-
date the parameters of the statistical models in-
volved in the translation process. Model updates
can be quickly executed in a sentence-wise man-
ner allowing the system to be used in a real time
scenario. For this purpose, a log-linear SMT
model where all its score components are incre-
mentally updateable is defined. The implemented
proposal uses the incremental version of the EM
algorithm (Neal and Hinton, 1998) and the spe-
cific details can be found in (Ortiz-Mart´ınez et al.,
2010; Ortiz-Martinez, 2011).
Empirical results obtained with THOT and re-
ported in (Ortiz-Mart´ınez et al., 2010; Ortiz-
Martinez, 2011) show that incremental learning al-
lows to significantly reduce the user effort in IMT
tasks with respect to that required by a conven-
tional IMT system.
Additionally, the incremental learning tech-
niques provided by THOT are currently being used
in other sophisticated applications such as active
learning for SMT (Gonz´alez-Rubio et al., 2012).

cations, including multi-source SMT, Viterbi-like
estimation of phrase-based models or discrimina-
tive training, just to name a few.
A very straightforward technique can be pro-
posed for finding the best phrase-alignment.
Specifically, the search process only requires a
regular SMT system which filters its phrase table
in order to obtain those target translations for the
source sentence that are compatible with the given
target sentence. Unfortunately, this technique has
no practical interest when applied on regular tasks
due to problems with unseen events.
To overcome the above-mentioned difficulty, an
alternative technique that is able to consider every
source phrase of the source sentence as a possi-
ble translation of every target phrase of the target
sentence can be defined. The THOT toolkit imple-
ments the proposal described in (Ortiz-Mart´ınez et
al., 2008), which combines a specific search al-
gorithm with smoothing techniques to enable ef-
ficient exploration of the set of possible phrase-
alignments for a sentence pair.
Phrase-based alignment quality was difficult to
evaluate since there is not a gold standard for this
task. One way to solve this problem consists in re-
fining the phrase alignments to word alignments
and compare them with those obtained in exist-
ing shared tasks on word alignment evaluation.
Results obtained with THOT reported in (Ortiz-
Martinez et al., 2008) clearly show the efficacy of
the implemented method.

6 Standard Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991780882352941">
THOT incorporates a number of standard features
that are present in existing translation tools. Such
standard features are briefly enumerated and de-
scribed in the following paragraphs.
Phrase-Based SMT Decoder The toolkit im-
plements a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT de-
coder. The decoder uses a log-linear model with
a complete set of components similar to those im-
plemented in other tools such as Moses. Results
reported in (Ortiz-Martinez, 2011) show that the
translation quality obtained by THOT is compara-
ble to that obtained by means of Moses.
Scalable Training and Search Algorithms
Due to the increasing availability of large train-
ing corpora, it is necessary to implement scalable
training and search algorithms. THOT incorpo-
rates tools to train statistical models from corpora

<bodyText confidence="0.999913578947369">
of an arbitrary size. Such tools can take advan-
tage of the availability of multiple processors or
computer clusters. The parameters of the result-
ing models can be pruned or accessed from disk
during the decoding stage.
Client-Server Implementation An important
part of the functionality provided by the toolkit can
be accessed using a client-server model. This is a
useful feature to build web applications offering
SMT services.
Miscellaneous SMT tools THOT reduces de-
pendencies with third-party software by integrat-
ing most critical components of a typical machine
translation pipeline, from the estimation of phrase-
based and language models to the generation of
translations and their automatic evaluation. The
estimation of word-alignment models using the in-
cremental EM algorithm is also implemented by
the toolkit.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961538461539">
THOT is an open-source toolkit for SMT de-
signed for its use in Unix-like and Windows sys-
tems. It has been developed using C++ and shell
scripting, and it is released under LGPL license.
THOT incorporates three advanced features that
have received little attention in previous publicly-
available SMT tools, namely, interactive machine
translation, incremental learning and generation of
phrase-based alignments. Additionally, THOT also
implements standard features such as training of
statistical models or decoding. The functionality
of the toolkit has been empirically tested, showing
its efficacy in different SMT-related tasks.

Advanced features correspond to sophisticated functionality that has received poor or no attention in existing SMT toolkits. By contrast, standard features correspond to functionality already provided by popular tools such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). In this regard, THOT neither is based on Moses nor shares any source code with it. THOT includes the following advanced features: • Computer-aided translation, including postediting and interactive machine translation (IMT). This functionality has been integrated in a translation tool developed in the CasMaCat project1 (the so-called CasMaCat Workbench). • Incremental estimation of all of the models involved in the translation process. • Robust generation of phrase-based alignments. Computer-aided translation and more specifically two of its applications, post-editing and IMT, constitute a f</context>

CAT can be instantiated in different ways. The THOT toolkit incorporates tools that are useful in two different CAT instantations, namely, postediting and interactive machine translation. 3.1 Post-Editing Post-editing (PE) involves making corrections and amendments to machine generated translations (see (TAUS, 2010) for a detailed study). In the PE scenario, the user only edits the output of the MT system without further system intervention. 3.2 Interactive Machine Translation In the IMT framework (Foster et al., 1997; Langlais et al., 2002), the user obtains her desired translations in a series of interactions with an MT system. Specifically, the system initially generates a translation without human intervention and after that, the user validates a prefix of the translation and introduce the next correct character of it. With this information, the IMT system returns the suffix which best completes the user prefix. This process is repeated until the user gets the sentence she has in mind. In (Barrachina et al., 2009), SMT techniques were embedded within the interactive translation environment. A common problem in IMT arises when</context>

In spite of this, this application has not previously been implemented in open-source software tools. Incremental (or online) learning is a hot research topic in SMT due to the great interest of quickly incorporating incoming data into existing translation systems. In spite of the fact that the Moses toolkit already implements incremental learning techniques, such techniques are designed to work by incrementally processing large blocks of data and not in a sentence-wise manner, as it is pointed out in (Mirking and Cancedda, 2013).

Model updates can be quickly executed in a sentence-wise manner allowing the system to be used in a real time scenario. For this purpose, a log-linear SMT model where all its score components are incrementally updateable is defined. The implemented proposal uses the incremental version of the EM algorithm (Neal and Hinton, 1998) and the specific details can be found in (Ortiz-Mart´ınez et al., 2010; Ortiz-Martinez, 2011). Empirical results obtained with THOT and reported in (Ortiz-Mart´ınez et al., 2010; OrtizMartinez, 2011) show that incremental learning allows to significantly reduce the user effort in IMT tasks with respect to that required by a conventional IMT system. Additionally, the incremental learning techniques provided by THOT are currently being used in other sophisticated applications such as active learning for SMT (Gonz´alez-Rubio et al., 2012). 5 Generation of Phrase-Based Alignments The generation o</context>

Due to the inherent difficulties of developing good quality software (correct, efficient, modular, extensible, well-documented, etc.), there are interesting research ideas that not always receive enough attention from the open-source software community. We present the THOT toolkit for statistical machine translation (SMT). The first public version of THOT was initially created in 2005 (Ortiz et al., 2005) and its functionality was restricted to train phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003). Here we present a new version of THOT which includes several new features related to phrasebased translation. More specifically, the set of feaFrancisco Casacuberta Dpto. de Sist. Inf. y Comp. Univ.
