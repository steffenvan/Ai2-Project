This paper describes a compositional semantics for temporal expressions as part of the meaning
representation language (MRL) of the JANUS system, a natural language understanding and generation
system under joint development by BBN Labs and ISI. The analysis is based on a higher-order
intensional logic described in detail in Hinrichs (1987a). Temporal expressions of English are translated
into this language as quantifiers over times that bind temporal indices on predicates. The semantic
evaluation of time-dependent predicates is defined relative to a set of discourse contexts, which,
following Reichenbach (1947), include the parameters of speech time and reference time. The resulting
context-dependent and multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expressions solves a set of well-known
problems that arise when traditional systems of tense logic are applied to natural language semantics.
Based on the principle of rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature of the analysis provides a
straightforward and well-defined interface between the parsing component and the semantic-interpre-
tation component of JANUS.

1 INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.999744714285714">
JANUS is a natural language understanding and gener-
ation system that allows the user to interface with
several knowledge bases maintained by the U.S. Navy.
The knowledge bases contain, among other things,
information about the deployment schedules, locations,
and readiness conditions of the ships in the Pacific
Fleet.

f. Every admiral has to deploy a ship today.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978694444445">
As the sample queries in (1) demonstrate, much of this
information is highly time-dependent: ships change lo-
cations in accordance with their deployment schedules.
They can incur equipment failures or undergo personnel
changes. Such events, in turn, can affect the ships&apos;
readiness ratings, which are expressed by codes such as
C3 or C4. Much of the information that the JANUS user
is trying to access is time-dependent in that an appro-
priate answer can be given only if the time of the query
and/or the time of the events in question are taken into
account. It is, therefore, imperative that at the level of
semantic representation of the natural language input an
adequate analysis can be provided for those linguistic
expressions that carry time information: for example,
tenses, temporal adverbials, and temporal adjectives.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In
Section 2, I will sketch the basic ideas of the framework
of logical semantics, or more specifically, of Montague
Grammar, the framework that I will use for my analysis.
Section 2 also gives a brief overview of the conceptual
modularity of the JANUS system, which demonstrates
how Montague Grammar as a linguistic theory can be
applied in natural-language processing research. In sec-
tions 3-8, I will address the subject matter of temporal
semantics itself. My own analysis of temporal semantics
is very much a response to the kinds of analyses that
have been provided in classical tense logic. Section 3,
therefore, provides a brief overview of analyses of the
latter type. In Section 4, I will review some well-known
problems that arise when one applies classical tense
logics to the semantics of natural language. In Section 5,
I will show how a logic with multiple indices that is
based on Reichenbach&apos;s analysis of English tense can
overcome most of the problems that standard tense
logic cannot. While this richer logic will solve most of
our problems, the issue of tense and noun-phrase (NP)

quantification does require additional refinements of the
analysis. Section 6 will show how giving narrow scope
to tense quantifiers enables us to provide adequate
scope relations with respect to NP quantifiers. In addi-
tion, I will show how a contextual analysis of nouns and
noun phrases lets us account for the kind of temporal
phenomena that were first discussed in Enc 1981, 1986.
In Section 7, I argue that the context-dependent feature
of the analysis does not add extra complexity to my
treatment of time-dependent expressions, but is needed
for purposes of discourse understanding in general.
Finally, I will demonstrate in Section 8 how the narrow
scope of tense also leads to a compositional syntax and
semantics of tensed sentences in English.

2 THE SEMANTIC FRAMEWORK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999601">
The semantic theory that I have adopted in my research
is that of truth-conditional semantics. More specifically,
I have adopted the framework of Montague Grammar, a
version of truth-conditional semantics that has been
developed by the logician Richard Montague (cf. Mon-
tague 1973).1 Montague Grammar shares the fundamen-
tal assumption of all truth-conditional theories of mean-
ing, namely that natural language semantics has to
relate in a systematic fashion linguistic expressions such
as words, phrases, and sentences to nonlinguistic, real-
world objects, events, and states of affairs. In particu-
lar, a semantic theory has to provide a rigorous defini-
tion of the truth conditions for the sentences of a
language. The emphasis in Montague Grammar lies on
the descriptive aspect of language use. Sentences say
something true or false about the world. For a speaker
to know the meaning of a sentence amounts to knowing
what state of affairs has to obtain in the world, in order
for the sentence to be true.
In a Montague Grammar the meanings of sentences,
phrases, and words are interpreted relative to a model
that assigns meanings of the appropriate type to such
linguistic entities. In his papers Montague develops
various instantiations of his theory. The one that is most
commonly used by linguists is the one that Montague
(1973) uses in his paper &amp;quot;The Proper Treatment of
Quantification in Ordinary English&amp;quot; (commonly abbre-
viated as PTQ). In that paper Montague associates
meanings with linguistic expressions in an indirect fash-
ion. As shown in Figure 1, syntactic expressions of
English are first translated into a language of higher-
order intensional logic, which in turn is interpreted
model-theoretically. This indirect method of semantic
interpretation obeys Frege&apos;s Principle of Composition-
ality, , which says that the meaning of a complex phrase
is a function of two things: (1) the meanings of its
constituent parts, and (2) the way in which these parts
are syntactically combined. Formally speaking, the
meaning of a complex expression is the homomorphic
image of its syntactic composition. In more practical

terms, a translation procedure from English into inten-
sional logic that is based on Frege&apos;s Principle has to
specify two things: (1) for each lexical item, the proce-
dure has to specify a translation into the appropriate
type of the logic, and (2) for each syntactic rule, the
procedure has to specify how the translations of the
input constituents combine in the translation for the
output constituent of the syntactic rule.
Montague Grammar provides a simple and elegant
interface between the syntactic and semantic compo-
nents of a grammar. Since each syntactic operation is
mirrored by a semantic operation, semantic interpreta-
tion is in a sense syntax-driven. Moreover, syntactic
analysis and semantic interpretation can proceed in
parallel: while a sentence or phrase is being parsed in
accordance with the syntactic rules, its logical form can
be computed by the translation rules. This inherent
parallelism is one of the features that makes Montague
Grammar an attractive theory for natural language
processing. Everything else being equal, a system in
which syntax and semantics can operate in parallel is
computationally more efficient than one in which they
have to operate sequentially.
Another attractive feature is the strict modularity
between syntax and semantics. Modularity is not only
good practice in software engineering, it is particularly
important in building natural language interfaces. If one
wants to extend the coverage of the grammar of a given
system, one wants to do so in an incremental fashion
and without having to modify the control structure
between major components. Montague Grammar allows
one to upscale a system in this way: in order to extend
the coverage of the grammar, one simply writes addi-
tional syntactic rules and translation rules that cover the
new data.
Apart from these methodological considerations, it
turns out that the same three components (syntax,
translation, and model-theoretic interpretation) that are
of importance in Montague&apos;s theory form an integral
part in the functional components of natural language
interface systems such as JANUS.2 Figure 2 shows that

the English input is fed into the syntactic parser of
JANUS, which yields as output a parse tree, which in
turn forms the input to the translation component. The
translation component generates some logical expres-
sion that represents the meaning of the English input.
This logical expression is then evaluated with respect to
the database, which one can take to be a proxy for a
partial model of the real world, in the case of JANUS a
model of the objects and states of affairs pertaining to
the Pacific Fleet.
The translation component of JANUS is somewhat
more elaborate than the one Montague 1973 formulates.
At the first level of translation, every lexical item of
English is translated into some logical expression of an
English-oriented formal language called EFL. At the
EFL level, no attention is given to the context that may
contribute to the interpretation of the English input.
Neither is any attempt made at the EFL level to
disambiguate lexical meanings. Lexical disambiguation
is provided by a domain model, which, among other
things, captures all the information about lexical mean-
ings known to the system.3
Apart from domain knowledge, the system keeps
track of those aspects of a user&apos;s question-answer
session that are relevant for determining the reference
of context-dependent queries such as (2).

2. a. Question: Where were the carriers yesterday?
b. Answer: In the Indian Ocean.
c. Question: How long have they been there?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9967713">
The discourse model contains parameters such as the
time at which the question-answer session is taking
place. This parameter is necessary to calculate the
referent of deictic time adverbials such as yesterday in
(2a). In addition, the discourse model keeps track of
locations such as the Indian Ocean and referents of
noun phrases such as the carriers in order to interpret
locational adverbs such as there and anaphoric pro-
nouns such as they in (2c).
Input from the domain model and the discourse
model leads to translation to a world-model language
(WML), which in turn is translated into expressions of
the query language of the appropriate knowledge base:
a database IDB, an expert system FRESH, or a display
knowledge base OSGP. In this paper I will for the most
part concentrate on the level of syntax to EFL transla-
tion, although the context-dependent aspects of my
treatment of temporal semantics will lead to some
discussion of the discourse model of JANUS in sections
6 and 7 below.

3 APPLYING CLASSICAL TENSE LOGIC TO NATURAL
LANGUAGE SEMANTICS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999558192307692">
With this much of an introduction, let me now turn to
the topic of temporal semantics itself. My own analysis
is very much a response to the kinds of analyses that
have been provided in classical tense logic. When I refer
to classical tense logic, I mean the kinds of logics that
originate in the work of the logician Arthur Prior (cf.
Prior 1967) and that have subsequently been applied to
natural language semantics (cf. Montague 1973 and
Mott 1973).
In classical tense logic time-dependency of informa-
tion enters into the definition of the notion of a propo-
sition. Propositions are defined as functions from a set
of times (TI) to the set of truth values (T—&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;) and
(F—&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;). Declarative sentences of natural language
are taken to express propositions. The sentence It is
raining can be taken to be that proposition that yields
the value true for those times at which it is raining, and
false for those at which it is not.
Tense operators can be defined in such a logic as in
(3) and (4). Formula 3 defines a past operator P, which,
applied to a proposition p, yields the value true for some
time t if p is true at some time t&apos; prior to t. Likewise, (4)
defines a Y operator, where Y is mnemonic for yester-
day, with the expected truth conditions: Yp is true at t
if p is true at some time t&apos; that falls within the day prior
to the day in which t falls.

4. [Y p], = T iff [p]t, = T for some time
t&apos; C [DAY (t) — 1].
All of this sounds rather plausible. However, it turns
out that if one tries to apply tense operators such as P
and Y in natural-language semantics, a set of well-
known problems arises.4

4. INADEQUACIES OF CLASSICAL TENSE LOGIC
4.1 INTERACTION OF TENSE AND TIME ADVERBIALS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909142857143">
The first such problem, which I pointed out in Hinrichs
1981 and which was independently noted in Dowty
1982, concerns the interaction between tense and time
adverbials. If for Sentence 5, one interprets the past
tense in (5) by the P operator and the adverbial yester-
day by the Y operator, then one of the two operators
has to have scope over the other.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999267">
5. Vincent left yesterday.
6. P [ Y [ leave&apos; (Vincent&apos;) ] ]
7. Y [ P [ leave&apos; (Vincent&apos;) ] ]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99929905">
However, neither the formula in (6), nor the one in (7)
gives adequate truth conditions for (5). The truth con-
ditions imposed by (6) are inadequate, since the sen-
tence in (5) would, for example, count as true when
uttered on January 15, 1988, if the ship Vincent left not
on January 14, 1988, but instead on May 23, 1986. This
is because the P operator can shift the temporal evalu-
ation of the proposition Y [leave&apos; (Vincent&apos;)] from the
speech time to any past time (t&amp;quot;), for example to some
time (t&amp;quot;) on May 24, 1986. In this case the Y operator
will, in turn, shift evaluation to t&apos; within the day prior to
t&amp;quot;, i.e., to some time on May 23, 1986. Hence the
proposition leave&apos; (Vincent&apos;) will be evaluated with
respect to that day, instead of the day prior to the
speech time.
Formula 7 can assign wrong truth conditions as well.
Here the Y operator shifts evaluation to some time
within the day prior to the speech time. But the P
operator, in turn, shifts evaluation to some time prior to
that, but necessarily not within the same day.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.931512">
4.2 INTERACTION OF TENSE AND NEGATION
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997285">
Similar problems arise when one uses standard tense
logic for sentences in which tense interacts with sen-
tence negation as in (8). As was first pointed out in
Partee 1973, one can assign the past-tense operator (P)
either narrow scope with respect to negation as in (9), or
wide scope as in (10).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993516666666667">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860666666667">
However, neither the formula in (9), nor the one in (10)
assigns adequate truth conditions to (8). Formula 9 says
that there exists no time in the past at which the
proposition is true, clearly not capturing the meaning of
(8). Formula 10 makes (8) true if at any time in the past
Vincent did not leave. Given that ships participate in
events other than arrivals at some point during their
existence, (10) will be trivially satisfied, but does not
capture adequately the truth conditions of (8).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999566">
4.3 TENSE AND QUANTIFIED NOUN PHRASES
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992812">
The third type of inadequacy of standard tense logic has
to do with the interaction of tense and quantified NPs
and was first pointed out in Enc 1981, 1986. Enc points
out that Priorean tense operators fail to capture certain
readings of sentences such as (11).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.937859">
11. Every admiral was (once) a cadet.
12. V x [ admiral&apos; (x) —&gt; P [ cadet&apos; (x) ]]
13. P [ V x [ admiral&apos; (x) —&gt; cadet&apos; (x) ]]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999636384615385">
Since P is a propositional operator, it can take scope
over the consequent of the material implication in (12).
Formula 12 represents the reading that everyone who is
an admiral now was a cadet at some time in the past.
The second reading in (13), where P has scope over the
entire formula, assigns the somewhat absurd truth con-
ditions that at some time in the past every admiral was
simultaneously a cadet. However, as Enc observes
correctly, with propositional tense operators we cannot
obtain the perfectly natural reading that everyone who
is an admiral now or who was an admiral at some time
in the past was a cadet at some time prior to being an
admiral.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998211">
4.4 TEMPORAL ANAPHORA
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.934546230769231">
There is a fourth problem that arises when one uses
tense operators of standard tense logic for the semantic
interpretation of pieces of discourse or of single sen-
tences that describe multiple events.
14. Vincent was hit by a harpoon, was abandoned by
its crew, and sank.
The most natural interpretation of (14) is one in which
the events are understood to have happened in the same
temporal order as they are sequenced in the sentence.
However, if one uses a Priorean P operator to interpret
each occurrence of the past tense in (14), one arrives at
an interpretation, which incorrectly allows for any
temporal ordering.

5 A TENSE LOGIC WITH MULTIPLE INDICES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885533333333">
It turns out that most of the problems that we have just
discussed can be solved if one recognizes more than one
parameter of temporal evaluation. In the models given
to tense logics such as the ones first developed by Prior,
one standardly evaluates propositions with respect to a
single time that we may call the event time, the time at
which an event happens or at which a state of affairs
obtains. The point of speech is taken to be a special case
of this parameter.
An alternative to models with only one temporal
parameter was given in Reichenbach 1947. Reichenbach
argues for distinguishing between three parameters,
which he calls speech time, event time, and reference
time. The meaning of the first two parameters should be
self-explanatory. It is the third parameter, reference

time, that requires explanation. Reichenbach conceives
of reference time as the temporal perspective from
which an event is viewed, as opposed to the event time,
the time at which the event occurs. Reference time can
be either implicit in the discourse context or explicitly
specified by temporal adverbials such as yesterday. For
each individual tense, reference time is temporally
ordered with respect to the other two parameters.
Reference time plays a crucial role in Reichenbach&apos;s
account of the distinction between the simple past and
the present perfect in English. In both cases event time
precedes speech time. But while for the simple past, the
event time is viewed from a perspective in the past, the
event is viewed from the perspective of the present in
the case of the present perfect.
As first shown in Aqvist 1976 and Guenthner 1979,
Reichenbach&apos;s analysis can be formalized in a tense
logic in which tense operators are evaluated with re-
spect to multiple indices. For example, a Reichen-
bachean past operator (P) can be defined as in (15).
15. [P Pits,tr,te = T iff [Pits,tr,t&apos; for some time t&apos; such
that t&apos; &lt; ts and t&apos; C tr.
The parameters of evaluation in (15), ts, tr, and te, stand
for speech time, reference time, and event time, respec-
tively. The operator P shifts evaluation of the event time
te to some time (t&apos;) in the past such that t&apos; falls within
some reference time tr. Note that contrary to Reichen-
bach&apos;s original account of the past tense, the parameters
of reference time and speech time are not directly
ordered in (15), but only indirectly by virtue of the
temporal ordering between event time t&apos; and the speech
time ts. This weaker ordering between tr and ts is
motivated by sentences such as (16), in which the
reference time denoted by the adverbial today contains
the speech time ts.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.524865">
16. Vincent arrived today.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.919143434782609">
In the intended models of interpretation for the P
operator in (15), times are taken to be time intervals.
Since (15) requires that the event time t&apos; be located prior
to ts and be contained in tr, (15) imposes as a restriction
on tr that a subinterval of tr be ordered prior to ts. In
order for (16) to be true, the subinterval of tr that lies in
the past has to be a proper subinterval of tr, whereas for
(17) all of tr has to precede ts.
17. Vincent left yesterday.
Given Reichenbach&apos;s parameters, the definition of the
Y operator, given earlier in (5), can be modified as in
(18).
18. [Y P]ts,tr,te = T iff [Plts,DAY(ts)-1,te = T.
Unlike the P operator in (15), Y in (18) does not shift te;
instead, it operates on tr and shifts that parameter to
day prior to ts.
With the redefined operators P and Y, one can now
give adequate truth conditions for sentences involving
tense and time adverbials. The logical form for (17), for
example, can be evaluated as in (19): Y specifies the
reference time to be the day prior to the speech time,
and the P operator, in turn, correctly locates the event
time as being within that reference time.

<equation confidence="0.9585454">

<bodyText confidence="0.989259860465116">
for some t&apos; &lt; t and t&apos; C [DAY (ts)-1].
The P and Y operators, defined in (15) and (18) above,
differ from the operators found in Aqvist, Guenthner,
and Dowty in that in my analysis all three of Reichen-
bach&apos;s parameters are taken to be separate for purposes
of evaluation, while Aqvist, Guenthner, and Dowty
define operators that are evaluated with respect to two
parameters only. This is because Dowty considers the
speech time as a special case of the reference time,
while Aqvist and Guenthner consider speech time to be
a special case of the event time.
As I have argued elsewhere (cf. Hinrichs 1981, 1986)
and as was noted independently in Dowty 1982, the
need for tense operators with three separate parameters
arises in the context of sentences such as (20).
20. Vincent rescued a ship yesterday which is now in
Hawaii.
As first noted in Kamp 1971, the interpretation of now
requires that the speech point of the utterance be
carried along at every stage of evaluating sentences
such as (20), whose logical form can be represented as
in (21).
21. Y [P [3x [ship&apos; (x) &amp; rescue&apos; (Vincent&apos;, x) &amp; NOW
[be-in&apos; (x,Hawaii&apos;)]]]]
In the evaluation of (21), the Y operator, as defined in
(18), fixes the reference time as the day prior to ts, while
the P operator from (15) shifts the event time to some
time within that reference time. NOW, the third tempo-
ral operator in (21), appears in the scope of the Y and
the P operator. NOW, which can be defined as in (22),
can be interpreted correctly in the context of (20), only
if the speech time is kept as a separate index and held
constant even though reference time and event time
have been changed by the P and Y operators.
22. [NOW nol
,,ts,tr,te = T iff [Pits,te,te = T for ts C tr&apos;.
Using temporal operators with multiple indices of eval-
uation, one can also account correctly for the interac-
tion of tenses and negation. In the evaluation of (23)
shown in (24), the past operator locates the event time
t&apos; prior to speech time and within some reference time
tr, which in the case of (23) has to be taken to be
contextually specified.

no time within tr at which the untensed proposition

It turns out that a multi-indexed tense logic provides
the basis for an adequate account of tense in discourse.
By associating event times with respect to temporally
ordered reference times, as sketched in (26), one can
indirectly induce an ordering among the events them-
selves. Moreover, by updating such reference times
after each event description, one can order multiple
events as described in (25) in the appropriate way. The
relations &lt; and C in (26) are meant to stand for temporal
precedence and temporal inclusion, respectively.

In order to induce the correct temporal orderings among
events and states of affairs in a given discourse, refer-
ence times have to be updated appropriately during
discourse processing. Formula 26 shows the simplest
case of such updating. A new reference time is intro-
duced after processing each event so that the temporal
order of the events becomes isomorphic to the order in
which the events are introduced. However, for more
complicated pieces of discourse the conditions under
which new reference times are introduced can be far
more complex. The aspectual properties of the events in
question, event-subevent relations, causal connections
obtaining among events and states of affairs, as well as
the overall structure of the discourse itself are among
the conditioning factors. It will not be possible to give a
detailed account of these issues here; for a more thor-
ough discussion of how to interpret temporal structures
in discourse on the basis of a multi-indexed tense logic,
I refer the reader to Hinrichs 1981, 1986 and Partee
1984.
Let us consider next two alternative logical represen-
tations for Sentence 27 in such a multi-indexed logic.

The formula in (28) we have already discussed. In (28)
past tense is translated into a propositional operator
whose semantics is implicit in the truth conditions
imposed with respect to the model-theory. In (29) the
past tense leads to existential quantification over times.
The existential quantifier binds variables which appear
as extra argument positions on predicates. Thus, leave&apos;,
which is ordinarily a one-place predicate, turns into a
two-place predicate that takes individuals and times as
its arguments. The variables ts and tr occur as free
variables in (29) and, as stated earlier, stand for the
Reichenbachean speech time and reference time, re-
spectively.
Although the two formulas in (28) and (29) are
logically equivalent in the sense that both are true under
the same set of models, I will adopt the style of logical
representation in (29) for the remainder of this paper.
This is because in the context of the JANUS system it
is important to explicitly quantify over times, since in
the database times are explicitly entered as dates, time
stamps, etc. In order to be able to access them, it is
important to incorporate time information explicitly at
the level of logical form.
A second reason for preferring the style of represen-
tation in (29) over the one in (28) concerns the interac-
tion between tenses and quantified NPs. Since formulas
such as (29) explicitly quantify over times, scope rela-
tions with respect to quantification over individuals
become completely transparent.

Using the style of representation exemplified by for-

If tense operators such as P have propositional scope, P

over any larger elements in a sentence, and 2. verb
meanings as well as noun meanings are indexical in the

In accordance with the Reichenbachean analysis of
tense outlined in the previous section, the past tense of
sentence (30) contributes to (33) the existential quanti-
fication over times t&apos; that precede the speech point ts
and are contained in some contextually specified refer-
ence time tr. Following Enc, tense is thus given scope
only over the predicate that corresponds to the main
verb. However, I do not follow Enc in her second
assumption, namely, her treatment of nouns and verbs
as indexicals. It is characteristic of true indexicals such
as I, there, or you that their denotation is completely
determined by a certain aspect of the context of the
utterance. / refers to the speaker, you to the address-
ee(s), there to some contextually salient location, etc. In
contrast to such indexical expressions, the (temporal)
evaluation of nouns and verbs does not always depend
on a single contextual parameter. In the case of complex
nouns such as former admiral, last readiness rating, or
previous nautical position, temporal evaluation has to
be shifted twice: first from the speech point to some
contextually salient reference point and then in turn to
some second time relative to which the nouns admiral,
readiness rating, and nautical positions themselves are
evaluated. In order to accommodate complex temporal
evaluations of nouns and verbs, their corresponding
predicates in logical form, such as admiral&apos; and gradu-
ate-from&apos; in (36), carry a time-denoting argument posi-
tion as part of their function-argument structure. Since
the temporal evaluation of such predicates can be
shifted freely, their interpretation differs crucially from
that of true indexicals whose interpretation can be
completely determined with respect to a single contex-
tual parameter.
Even though I do not follow Enc in treating nouns
and verbs as indexical expressions, I do recognize that
the interpretation of noun phrases such as every admiral
in (30) is in part dependent on the context in which the
sentence is used. Speakers asserting (30) are not likely
to make the claim that every admiral who ever served in
the navy of any country that has naval forces graduated
from the Naval Academy in Annapolis. Typically, (30)
will be used to make a claim about a much restricted set
of admirals, say all the admirals in the U.S. Navy or all
admirals in the Pacific Fleet. Exactly which set of
admirals a speaker focuses on will depend on the
discourse context in which the sentence is used. This
phenomenon of restricted quantification of noun
phrases is certainly not restricted to the interpretation
of every admiral in (30), but applies to quantified noun
phrases in general, as Stalnaker (1973), who cites ex-
amples such as (34), was among the first to point out.
34. Everyone is having a good time.
In (34) the interpretation of everyone typically does not
involve the set of all individuals currently alive, but
rather the set of all individuals in a given context; for
example, everyone at a certain party, at a certain
location, and at a given time.
In order to accommodate this contextual aspect of
the interpretation of noun phrases in my analysis, I
introduce into the translation of quantified NPs a pred-
icate (R), which is meant to range over properties that
are salient in a given context and which serve to narrow
down the reference of the noun phrase in question. Let
me illustrate the context-dependent evaluation of quan-
tified NPs by once again focusing on Sentence 30 and its
translation in (33).

Imagine that (30) is uttered in a context in which all

In a context in which all present or past admirals in the
Pacific Fleet are under discussion, a reading that, as we
pointed out in Section 4.3, one cannot capture using
Priorean tense operators, we can capture by instantiat-
ing R as in (37), where stands for the relation
temporally preceding or equal to.
37. At Ay [be-in&apos; (Pac-Fleet&apos;) (y) (t) &amp; t ts ]
Notice that the contextual variable R serves double
duty in my analysis. This double role derives from the
fact that R is a two-place predicate with individuals and
time intervals as its two arguments. The argument
ranging over individuals serves to restrict the denota-
tion of the noun that R is associated with; for example,
it restricts the denotation of admiral in (33). The argu-
ment of R that ranges over time intervals, on the other
hand, serves to restrict the time interval at which the
associated noun denotation is evaluated; for example, if
R is instantiated by (35) or (37), temporal evaluation of
the associated predicate admiral in (33) is restricted to
the speech point or to time intervals prior to or including
the speech point.
Temporal evaluation of the verbal predicates is, thus,

kept separate from the temporal evaluation of predi-
cates corresponding to other constituents in the sen-
tence. As first pointed out by Enc, this strategy makes
it possible to account for sentences such as (38) and
(39), whose translations require that the predicates
secretary and fugitive be evaluated relative to a time
that is distinct from the evaluation time of the predicate
corresponding to the verb.5

In contrast to an analysis that interprets the past tense
in terms of a Priorean P operator, the narrow-scope
analysis of tense also avoids the dilemma of inducing a
simultaneity reading for Sentence 30, if P has scope
over the entire formula, as in the Translation 40 of (30).

The reading in (40) is factually implausible for two
reasons: 1. It imposes simultaneity as part of the truth
conditions and requires that all admirals graduated at
the same time, and 2. since the P operator forces
temporal evaluation of all predicates in its scope at the
same index, in the case of (40) it requires that every
admiral graduated from Annapolis as an admiral, and
not, as is actually the case, subsequent to graduation
from the Naval Academy.
Notice that the formula in (33), which represents the
translation of (30) in my analysis, avoids both problems
associated with (40).

Since temporal evaluation of the predicates admiral&apos;
and graduate-from&apos; are kept separate, the first problem
does not arise. Since the predicates are existentially
quantified over independently, (33), in contrast to (40),
also avoids having to assign a simultaneity reading to
(30).
As I have outlined in this section, my treatment of
tense and quantification is based on two basic assump-
tions: 1. Verbal predicates and nominal predicates both
have an argument position that ranges over time inter-
vals; however, evaluations of verbal and nominal pred-
icates are independent of one another. The evaluation of
verbal predicates is governed by quantification over
time intervals that involve Reichenbach&apos;s parameters of
speech time, event time, and reference time. 2. The
denotation of quantified NPs is restricted by the predi-
cate R, which ranges over properties that are salient in
the context of utterance. In conjunction with the nar-
row-scope analysis of tense, it is this context dependent
feature of my analysis that makes it more flexible than
a wide-scope analysis of tense.
One of the counterarguments that one may raise
against this context-dependent aspect of my analysis of
temporal semantics concerns the fact that tracking the
salience of objects and their properties in natural-
language discourse is a notoriously difficult problem.
However, I will argue in the next section that whatever
mechanisms are needed to track saliency, such mecha-
nisms are independently motivated by semantic and
pragmatic phenomena that go beyond the phenomenon
of temporal interpretation.

7 EVALUATING TIME-DEPENDENT PREDICATES IN

Objects and certain of their properties can receive or
maintain salience in a discourse in any number of ways.
The notions of focus (Sidner 1983), of common ground
(Stalnaker 1973), and of mutual knowledge (Clark and
Marshall 1981) are certainly cases in point. In this
section I will concentrate on two such mechanisms that
play a role in the context-dependent interpretation of
time-dependent predicates. In each case I will argue
that the mechanism is needed for purposes other than
temporal interpretation and, therefore, does not add
complexity to my analysis of temporal semantics.
The first such mechanism concerns the way in which
objects and their properties can become salient in the
discourse context by virtue of the goals that the dis-
course participants are trying to accomplish over the
course of a given interaction. Consider a user of the
JANUS system whose goal it is to deploy a set of ships.
As part of achieving this goal, the user interacts with
JANUS by asserting (41a) and then by querying (41b),
whose translation is given by the formula in (42).

Following Scha 1983, I base the semantics of questions
on speech-act operators, such as QUERY, which take
the intensional meaning of the question as an argument.
The &apos; symbol in (42) stands for the intension operator as
defined in Montague 1973. POW stands for the power-
set operation, which I use for the interpretation of plural
nouns.6 POW in (42) is used to form the set of those
objects that at some time t have the property of being a
ship.7 For the technical details concerning the seman-
tics of the QUERY operator I refer the reader to Scha
1983. For the purposes of this paper, it should suffice
that QUERY has the effect of consulting the underlying
knowledge bases of the system as to which members of
the power set of ships, if any, have the property of being
in the Indian Ocean at the time of the query.

The point that I want to concentrate on with respect
to the formula in (42) concerns the instantiation of the
context-dependent predicate (R) that is associated with
the translation of the noun phrase which ships. Given
that the system recognizes the user&apos;s goal to be that of
immediate ship deployment for a search-and-rescue
mission, ships with a current readiness rating of C3 or
better are salient in the context, since only such ships
are deployable. By instantiating R appropriately, the
formula in (42) turns into (43).

The instantiation of R in (42) follows from recognizing
the user&apos;s plan as that of immediate ship deployment.
The importance of plan recognition for designing ques-
tion-answering systems that generate cooperative re-
sponses was emphasized in Allen/Perrault 1980, Allen
1983, and Pollack 1986. In the context of Example 41, if
it turned out that two ships, Frederick and Vincent, are
in the Indian Ocean, but both ships are rated C4, then a
cooperative response would be (44), instead of merely
listing the ship names.

<bodyText confidence="0.999708222222222">
Recognizing the user&apos;s intention, which in the given
context leads to the recognition of the current readiness
rating of ships as a salient property, will make such a
response possible. It, therefore, turns out that tracking
properties that are salient in context is needed not only
for evaluating predicates in the approach to temporal
semantics that I have developed in this paper, but
constitutes a task that is independently needed for the
purposes of generating cooperative responses in ques-
tion-answering.
The issue of plan recognition in discourse demon-
strates that objects and their properties can become
salient implicitly in discourse, that is, without explicit
linguistic reference. However, salience of objects and
properties can, of course, also be achieved at any point
within a discourse by virtue of the previous linguistic
context. Consider a sequence of user-system interac-
tions as in (45).

The person who asks the follow-up query (45c) to the
system&apos;s affirmative answer to the initial query (45a) is
not interested in being informed about all ships that at
some time in the future will arrive in Hawaii. Instead,
the user is interested in a much more restricted set of
ships that will arrive there, namely, the ones that were
deployed by some admiral the day before. The noun
ship in the final query in (45) has to be interpreted
relative to the discourse context, and the temporal
evaluation of the predicate is determined with respect to
that context, rather by the tense of the sentence, in this
case, the future. It turns out that a detailed proposal for
how to construct such a mechanism does, in fact,
already exist in the literature. Webber (1978, 1983) in
her work on the interpretation of pronouns in discourse,
has developed a framework that constructs during the
interpretation of a discourse a context that consists of a
set of what she calls discourse entities. These discourse
entities then become available as objects that pronouns
can refer to. One of the examples that Webber discusses
is the interpretation of the pronoun they in (47) in the
context of sentence (46).

Clearly, they refers to the set of ships deployed by some
admira1.8 In order to derive the appropriate discourse
entity for the interpretation of they, Webber suggests
the rule schema such as (48). Formula 48, which is a
slightly simplified version of Webber&apos;s original rule
schema, says that for any formula that meets the
structural description (SD), a discourse entity identified
by the ID formula is to be constructed.

Formula 50 imposes as truth conditions for (49) that
each member of a contextually specified set of admirals
deployed some contextually salient ship at some time t&apos;
within the day prior to the given speech time ts.
Contextual salience enters into the translation in (50)
since the predicates ship&apos; and admiral&apos; are associated
with distinct occurrences of the contextual variable R.
Which ships and which admirals are salient will, once
again, depend on the particular context. In a context in
which activities within the Pacific Fleet on the day prior
to the speech time are at issue, R1 and R2 in (50) will be
instantiated in such a way that the denotations of ship&apos;
and admiral&apos; are restricted to ships and admirals from
that particular fleet. Formula 51, the output of Rule

Schema 48 applied to (50), further restricts which ships
are salient, namely, the set of ships contextually spec-
ified by R1, which, in addition, were deployed on the
previous day by one of the admirals in question. The
discourse entity with the description, in turn, becomes
available for the interpretation of the pronoun they in a
follow-up sentence such as (47).
It turns out that the method of constructing discourse
entities is not only relevant to the interpretation of
pronouns, but also to the contextual interpretation of
nouns and noun phrases that I am concerned with here.
In particular, the discourse entity with the description in
(51) can serve not only for interpreting pronouns, but
also for instantiating R for the interpretation of the noun
ship in (45c) in the context of (45a).9

Since the discourse entity in (51), which ranges over a

R in Translation 52 of (45c) by this contextually salient
property, the temporal evaluation of the predicate ship&apos;

existential quantifier t for the future tense, but rather by
the quantifier t&apos; introduced by the contextually salient

The mechanism for deriving contextually salient prop-
erties that are introduced through the previous linguistic
discourse may strike the reader as rather complicated in
detail. However, the point that I made earlier in this
section with respect to tracking saliency as a side effect
of plan recognition applies to the tracking of properties
introduced by the linguistic context as well: tracking
such properties is important not only for temporal
evaluation, but is independently motivated by other
discourse phenomena such as anaphoric reference, as
Webber (1978, 1983) has convincingly shown.

TENSE
In the previous sections I have focused on the semantic
and pragmatic aspects of my analysis of temporal ex-
pressions, which concern in particular the features of
narrow-scope assignment and of context-dependent in-
terpretation of quantified NPs. In this section I will
concentrate on matters of syntax and will demonstrate
how the narrow-scope analysis makes it possible to
construct a straightforward compositional syntax and
semantics of tense in the framework of Montague
Grammar, the linguistic theory on which my analysis is
based.
Syntactically, tenses in English appear as inflectional
morphemes on verbs. In the notation of categorial
grammar, we may assign a syntactic tree as in (55) to
Sentence 54. The infinitival form of the verb arrive of
Category IV is combined with the past-tense morpheme
-ed to form a tensed intrasensitive verb IV*. Morpho-
syntactically, tenses are therefore items that apply to
individual words.
54. Every ship arrived.
55. Every ship arrived, S
Every ship, S/IV* arrived, IV*
Every, S/IV*/CN ship, CN arrive, IV
Since I assign tense narrow scope in the semantics and
let temporal quantifiers bind only the temporal index
associated with the main verb, I arrive at an analysis of
tense whose syntactic domain coincides with its seman-
tic domain. Compared to analyses in which tense is
assigned wide scope over formulas that correspond to
entire sentences (Montague 1973) or over entire verb
phrases (Bach 1980), the narrow-scope analysis, which
I have developed in this paper, has the advantage of
leading to a straightforward compositional syntax and
semantics of tense. In the syntax the tense morpheme
turns an untensed verb into its tensed counterpart,
while the corresponding translation rule existentially
quantifies over the time index of the predicate that
translated the untensed verb.

Rule Schema 56 ranges over untensed intrasensitive
verbs (IV), transitive verbs (IV/NP), ditransitive verbs
(IV/NP/NP), etc. The notation IV/NP thus stands for
an IV followed by n slashed NPs. The corresponding
translation schema in (57) denotes a function from the
type of meanings associated with object NPs, if any, to
functions from individuals to truth values. Although
these rule schemata are rather technical, their meaning
should become clear when one considers a concrete
example. Consider once again Example 54, whose syn-
tax has been given in (53).

The translation of the entire sentence can be built up in
a compositional fashion as in (57), which mirrors the
syntactic composition of (53).

The phrase every ship is formed by supplying the
predicate ship&apos; as an argument to the translation of
every. Notice that R is introduced by the translation of
the quantifier every. The translation of the entire sen-
tence is formed by supplying the translation of the
tensed verb arrived, which is produced by the transla-
tion rule in (57), to the translation of the subject NP.
The reduced translation results from two steps of
lambda reduction.

9 CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99965115">
In this paper I have argued that a logical semantics for
temporal expressions can provide adequate representa-
tions for natural-language input to an interface such as
JANUS. The temporal logic is based on Reichenbach&apos;s
models for the semantics of English tense and uses
multiple indices for semantic interpretation. This multi-
indexed logic overcomes the kinds of problems that
arise when systems of tense logics are used that rely on
just one index of evaluation.
I have demonstrated how giving narrow scope to
tense quantifiers enables us to provide adequate scope
relations with respect to NP quantifiers and to interpret
such NPs relative to a given discourse context. I have
argued that the context-dependent feature of the analy-
sis does not add extra complexity to my treatment of
time-dependent expressions, but is needed for purposes
of discourse understanding in general. Finally, I have
demonstrated how the narrow scope of tense results in
a fully compositional syntax and semantics of tensed
sentences in English.

NOTES
1. For a detailed introduction to Montague&apos;s theory, see Dowty,
Wall, and Peters 1981.
2. The components shown in the diagram are based on the architec-
ture of the PHLIQUA system described in Scha 1983.
3. For details on how the domain model functions in the overall
system see Ayuso, Shaked; and Weischedel 1987.
4. In fairness to Prior, it has to be pointed out that he designed his
temporal modal logics as purely formal systems and did not design
them with idea of applying them to natural language. However,
Priorean tense logic has, nonetheless, been applied to natural
language semantics. It is those studies that are subject to the
criticisms presented in sections 4.1-4.4.
5. Recall that Fawn Hall, North&apos;s secretary, testified before the
committee when she was no longer North&apos;s secretary. The
example is due to an editorial in the Boston Globe.
6. The reader may prefer some other approach to the semantics of
plurals or questions, say the lattice-theoretic approach to plurality
developed in Link 1983 or the analysis of questions found in
Groenendijk/Stokhof 1982 over the approach based on power sets
and the QUERY operator, respectively. These approaches are
also consistent with the point that I want to concentrate on with
respect to the formula in (42)-that is, the instantiation of the
context-dependent predicate (R).
7. Note that it follows from the narrow-scope analysis of tense
developed in Section 4 that the time at which the set of objects x
are ships need not be the same as the time at which that set of
objects is in the Indian Ocean. This aspect of (42) may strike the
reader as counterintuitive. Notice, however, that (42) represents
the first level of translation (the EFL level of Figure 2 with no
input from the domain model). It will be part of the domain
knowledge, however, that there are two kinds of properties: a.
properties such as being an admiral, which can hold of an
individual for certain subperiods; and b. properties such as being
a ship, which hold of an entity throughout its existence. It is on
the basis of such domain knowledge that at lower levels of
translation the two evaluation times at issue in (42) can, in fact, be
equated.
8. What is interesting about the example in its own right is that
syntactically there is no plural noun phrase in the preceding
discourse that could serve as the referent for the plural pronoun
they.
9. I am indebted to Bonnie Webber for pointing out to me that the
discourse entity evoked by (45a) can be used to restrict the
interpretation of the noun phrase which ships in (45c), only if the
answer to (45a) is affirmative. Thus, whether a discourse entity
can serve as a restrictor for the interpretation of subsequent NP&apos;s
is in part a function of the type of sentence that evokes the
discourse entity. If the expression that evokes a discourse entity
occurs in a declarative sentence, the discourse entity will auto-
matically be available as a potential restrictor for the interpreta-
tion of subsequent NPs. However, if the discourse entity is
evoked within an interrogative sentence and the existence of the
entity is not already presupposed by the question, the discourse
entity is licensed as a potential restrictor, only if the question has
an affirmative answer.

The analysis is based on a higher-order intensional logic described in detail in Hinrichs (1987a). Temporal expressions of English are translated into this language as quantifiers over times that bind temporal indices on predicates. The semantic evaluation of time-dependent predicates is defined relative to a set of discourse contexts, which, following Reichenbach (1947), include the parameters of speech time and reference time. The resulting context-dependent and multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expressions solves a set of well-known problems that arise when traditional systems of tense logic are applied to natural language semantics. Based on the principle of rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature of the analysis provides a straightforward and well-defined interface between the parsing component and the semantic-interpretation component of JANUS.</abstract>

But while for the simple past, the event time is viewed from a perspective in the past, the event is viewed from the perspective of the present in the case of the present perfect.

The notions of focus (Sidner 1983), of common ground (Stalnaker 1973), and of mutual knowledge (Clark and Marshall 1981) are certainly cases in point.

Hinrichs Tense, Quantifiers, and Contexts 4. INADEQUACIES OF CLASSICAL TENSE LOGIC 4.1 INTERACTION OF TENSE AND TIME ADVERBIALS The first such problem, which I pointed out in Hinrichs 1981 and which was independently noted in Dowty 1982, concerns the interaction between tense and time adverbials. If for Sentence 5, one interprets the past tense in (5) by the P operator and the adverbial yesterday by the Y operator, then one of the two operators has to have scope over the other. 5. Vincent left yesterday. 6. P [ Y [ leave&apos; (Vincent&apos;) ] ] 7. Y [ P [ leave&apos; (Vincent&apos;) ] ] However, neither the formula in (6), nor the one in (7) gives adequate truth conditions for (5). The truth conditions imposed by (6) are inadequate, since the sentence in (5) would, for example, count as true when uttered on January 15, 1988, if the ship Vince</context>

This is because Dowty considers the speech time as a special case of the reference time, while Aqvist and Guenthner consider speech time to be a special case of the event time. As I have argued elsewhere (cf. Hinrichs 1981, 1986) and as was noted independently in Dowty 1982, the need for tense operators with three separate parameters arises in the context of sentences such as (20). 20. Vincent rescued a ship yesterday which is now in Hawaii. As first noted in Kamp 1971, the interpretation of now requires that the speech point of the utterance be carried along at every stage of evaluating sentences such as (20), whose logical form can be represented as in (21). 21. Y [P [3x [ship&apos; (x) &amp; rescue&apos; (Vincent&apos;, x) &amp; NOW [be-in&apos; (x,Hawaii&apos;)]]]] In the evaluation of (21), the Y operator, as defined in (18), fixes the reference time as the day prior to ts, while the P ope</context>

Hinrichs Tense, Quantifiers, and Contexts quantification does require additional refinements of the analysis. Section 6 will show how giving narrow scope to tense quantifiers enables us to provide adequate scope relations with respect to NP quantifiers. In addition, I will show how a contextual analysis of nouns and noun phrases lets us account for the kind of temporal phenomena that were first discussed in Enc 1981, 1986. In Section 7, I argue that the context-dependent feature of the analysis does not add extra complexity to my treatment of time-dependent expressions, but is needed for purposes of discourse understanding in general. Finally, I will demonstrate in Section 8 how the narrow scope of tense also leads to a compositional syntax and semantics of tensed sentences in English. 2 THE SEMANTIC FRAMEWORK The semantic theory that I have adopted in my research is that of truth-conditional semantics.

Formula 9 says that there exists no time in the past at which the proposition is true, clearly not capturing the meaning of (8). Formula 10 makes (8) true if at any time in the past Vincent did not leave. Given that ships participate in events other than arrivals at some point during their existence, (10) will be trivially satisfied, but does not capture adequately the truth conditions of (8). 4.3 TENSE AND QUANTIFIED NOUN PHRASES The third type of inadequacy of standard tense logic has to do with the interaction of tense and quantified NPs and was first pointed out in Enc 1981, 1986. Enc points out that Priorean tense operators fail to capture certain readings of sentences such as (11). 11. Every admiral was (once) a cadet. 12. V x [ admiral&apos; (x) —&gt; P [ cadet&apos; (x) ]] 13. P [ V x [ admiral&apos; (x) —&gt; cadet&apos; (x) ]] Since P is a propositional operator, it can take scope over the consequent of the material implication in (12). Formula 12 represents the reading that everyone who is an admiral now was a cadet at some time in the past. The second reading in (13), where P has scope over the entire formula, assigns the somewhat absurd truth conditions that at some time in the </context>

P [Vx [admiral&apos; (x) —&gt; graduate-from&apos; (x,Annapolis&apos;)]] If tense operators such as P have propositional scope, P can either scope over an entire formula, as in (32), or over the consequent of the material implication, as in (31). Now, as we saw earlier, neither formula captures the reading that all present or past admirals graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis prior to their being admirals. Enc 1981 provides an interesting solution to the problem posed by examples such as (30). Her solution is based on two assumptions: 1. Semantically, tenses should have scope only over verb meanings, but not over any larger elements in a sentence, and 2. verb meanings as well as noun meanings are indexical in the sense that their interpretations depend on the context of the utterance in the same way that demonstrative pronouns such as that and anaphoric pronouns such as she and they do. As shown in Formula 33, which represents the translation for (30) in my analysis, I adopt Enc&apos;s first 8 Computational </context>

For each individual tense, reference time is temporally ordered with respect to the other two parameters. Reference time plays a crucial role in Reichenbach&apos;s account of the distinction between the simple past and the present perfect in English. In both cases event time precedes speech time. But while for the simple past, the event time is viewed from a perspective in the past, the event is viewed from the perspective of the present in the case of the present perfect. As first shown in Aqvist 1976 and Guenthner 1979, Reichenbach&apos;s analysis can be formalized in a tense logic in which tense operators are evaluated with respect to multiple indices. For example, a Reichenbachean past operator (P) can be defined as in (15). 15. [P Pits,tr,te = T iff [Pits,tr,t&apos; for some time t&apos; such that t&apos; &lt; ts and t&apos; C tr. The parameters of evaluation in (15), ts, tr, and te, stand for speech time, reference time, and event time, respectively. The operator P shifts evaluation of the event time te to some time (t&apos;) in the past such that t&apos; falls within some reference time tr.

The P and Y operators, defined in (15) and (18) above, differ from the operators found in Aqvist, Guenthner, and Dowty in that in my analysis all three of Reichenbach&apos;s parameters are taken to be separate for purposes of evaluation, while Aqvist, Guenthner, and Dowty define operators that are evaluated with respect to two parameters only. This is because Dowty considers the speech time as a special case of the reference time, while Aqvist and Guenthner consider speech time to be a special case of the event time. As I have argued elsewhere (cf. Hinrichs 1981, 1986) and as was noted independently in Dowty 1982, the need for tense operators with three separate parameters arises in the context of sentences such as (20). 20.

However, for more complicated pieces of discourse the conditions under which new reference times are introduced can be far more complex. The aspectual properties of the events in question, event-subevent relations, causal connections obtaining among events and states of affairs, as well as the overall structure of the discourse itself are among the conditioning factors. It will not be possible to give a detailed account of these issues here; for a more thorough discussion of how to interpret temporal structures in discourse on the basis of a multi-indexed tense logic, I refer the reader to Hinrichs 1981, 1986 and Partee 1984. Let us consider next two alternative logical representations for Sentence 27 in such a multi-indexed logic. 27. Vincent left yesterday. 28.

In (28) past tense is translated into a propositional operator whose semantics is implicit in the truth conditions imposed with respect to the model-theory. In (29) the past tense leads to existential quantification over times. The existential quantifier binds variables</context>

Finally, I will demonstrate in Section 8 how the narrow scope of tense also leads to a compositional syntax and semantics of tensed sentences in English. 2 THE SEMANTIC FRAMEWORK The semantic theory that I have adopted in my research is that of truth-conditional semantics. More specifically, I have adopted the framework of Montague Grammar, a version of truth-conditional semantics that has been developed by the logician Richard Montague (cf. Montague 1973).1 Montague Grammar shares the fundamental assumption of all truth-conditional theories of meaning, namely that natural language semantics has to relate in a systematic fashion linguistic expressions such as words, phrases, and sentences to nonlinguistic, realworld objects, events, and states of affairs. In particular, a semantic theory has to provide a rigorous definition of the truth conditions for the sentences of a language. The emphasis in Montague Grammar lies on the descriptive aspect of language use. Sentences say something true or false about the world. For a speaker to know the meani</context>

The translation component generates some logical expression that represents the meaning of the English input. This logical expression is then evaluated with respect to the database, which one can take to be a proxy for a partial model of the real world, in the case of JANUS a model of the objects and states of affairs pertaining to the Pacific Fleet. The translation component of JANUS is somewhat more elaborate than the one Montague 1973 formulates. At the first level of translation, every lexical item of English is translated into some logical expression of an English-oriented formal language called EFL. At the EFL level, no attention is given to the context that may contribute to the interpretation of the English input. Neither is any attempt made at the EFL level to disambiguate lexical meanings. Lexical disambiguation is provided by a domain model, which, among other things, captures all the information about lexical meanings known to the system.3 Apart from domain knowledge, the system keeps track of those aspects of a u</context>

My own analysis is very much a response to the kinds of analyses that have been provided in classical tense logic. When I refer to classical tense logic, I mean the kinds of logics that originate in the work of the logician Arthur Prior (cf. Prior 1967) and that have subsequently been applied to natural language semantics (cf. Montague 1973 and Mott 1973). In classical tense logic time-dependency of information enters into the definition of the notion of a proposition. Propositions are defined as functions from a set of times (TI) to the set of truth values (T—&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;) and (F—&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;). Declarative sentences of natural language are taken to express propositions. The sentence It is raining can be taken to be that proposition that yields the value true for those times at which it is raining, and false for those at which it is not. Tense operators can be defined in such a logic as in (3) and (4). Formula 3 defines a past operator P, </context>

The &apos; symbol in (42) stands for the intension operator as defined in Montague 1973. POW stands for the powerset operation, which I use for the interpretation of plural nouns.6 POW in (42) is used to form the set of those objects that at some time t have the property of being a ship.7 For the technical details concerning the semantics of the QUERY operator I refer the reader to Scha 1983. For the purposes of this paper, it should suffice that QUERY has the effect of consulting the underlying knowledge bases of the system as to which members of the power set of ships, if any, have the property of being in the Indian Ocean at the time of the query. 10 Computational Linguistics</context>

Compared to analyses in which tense is assigned wide scope over formulas that correspond to entire sentences (Montague 1973) or over entire verb phrases (Bach 1980), the narrow-scope analysis, which I have developed in this paper, has the advantage of leading to a straightforward compositional syntax and semantics of tense. In the syntax the tense morpheme turns an untensed verb into its tensed counterpart, while the corresponding translation rule existentially quantifies over the time index of the predicate that translated the untensed verb. 56.

Here the Y operator shifts evaluation to some time within the day prior to the speech time. But the P operator, in turn, shifts evaluation to some time prior to that, but necessarily not within the same day. 4.2 INTERACTION OF TENSE AND NEGATION Similar problems arise when one uses standard tense logic for sentences in which tense interacts with sentence negation as in (8). As was first pointed out in Partee 1973, one can assign the past-tense operator (P) either narrow scope with respect to negation as in (9), or wide scope as in (10). 8.

My own analysis is very much a response to the kinds of analyses that have been provided in classical tense logic. When I refer to classical tense logic, I mean the kinds of logics that originate in the work of the logician Arthur Prior (cf. Prior 1967) and that have subsequently been applied to natural language semantics (cf. Montague 1973 and Mott 1973). In classical tense logic time-dependency of information enters into the definition of the notion of a proposition. Propositions are defined as functions from a set of times (TI) to the set of truth values (T—&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;) and (F—&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;). Declarative sentences of natural language are taken to express propositions. The sentence It is raining can be taken to be that proposition that yields the value true for those times at which it is raining, and false for those at which it is not. Tense operator</context>

The analysis is based on a higher-order intensional logic described in detail in Hinrichs (1987a). Temporal expressions of English are translated into this language as quantifiers over times that bind temporal indices on predicates. The semantic evaluation of time-dependent predicates is defined relative to a set of discourse contexts, which, following Reichenbach (1947), include the parameters of speech time and reference time. The resulting context-dependent and multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expressions solves a set of well-known problems that arise when traditional systems of tense logic are applied to natural language semantics. Based on the principle of rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature of the analysis provides a straightforward and well-defined interface between the parsing component and the semantic-interpretation component of JANUS. 1 INTRODUCTION JANUS is a natural language understanding and generation system that allows t</context>

In the models given to tense logics such as the ones first developed by Prior, one standardly evaluates propositions with respect to a single time that we may call the event time, the time at which an event happens or at which a state of affairs obtains. The point of speech is taken to be a special case of this parameter. An alternative to models with only one temporal parameter was given in Reichenbach 1947. Reichenbach argues for distinguishing between three parameters, which he calls speech time, event time, and reference time. The meaning of the first two parameters should be self-explanatory. It is the third parameter, reference 6 Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 Erhard W. Hinrichs Tense, Quantifiers, and Contexts time, that requires explanation. Reichenbach conceives of reference time as the temporal perspective from which an event is viewed, as opposed to the event time, the time at which the event occurs. Reference time can be either implicit in the discourse cont</context>

Consider a user of the JANUS system whose goal it is to deploy a set of ships. As part of achieving this goal, the user interacts with JANUS by asserting (41a) and then by querying (41b), whose translation is given by the formula in (42). 41. a.

The &apos; symbol in (42) stands for the intension operator as defined in Montague 1973. POW stands for the powerset operation, which I use for the interpretation of plural nouns.6 POW in (42) is used to form the set of those objects that at some time t have the property of being a ship.7 For the technical details concerning the semantics of the QUERY operator I refer the reader to Scha 1983.

Exactly which set of admirals a speaker focuses on will depend on the discourse context in which the sentence is used. This phenomenon of restricted quantification of noun phrases is certainly not restricted to the interpretation of every admiral in (30), but applies to quantified noun phrases in general, as Stalnaker (1973), who cites examples such as (34), was among the first to point out. 34.

However, the point that I made earlier in this section with respect to tracking saliency as a side effect of plan recognition applies to the tracking of properties introduced by the linguistic context as well: tracking such properties is important not only for temporal evaluation, but is independently motivated by other discourse phenomena such as anaphoric reference, as Webber (1978, 1983) has convincingly shown. 8 A COMPOSITIONAL SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS OF TENSE In the previous sections I have focused on the semantic and pragmatic aspects of my analysis of temporal expressions, which concern in particular the features of narrow-scope assignment and of context-dependent interpretation of quantified NPs. In this section I will concentrate on matters of syntax and will demonstrate how the narrow-scope analysis makes it possible to construct a straightforward compositional syntax and semantics of tense in the framework of Montague Grammar, the linguistic theory on which my analysis i</context>

<rawString>6. The reader may prefer some other approach to the semantics of plurals or questions, say the lattice-theoretic approach to plurality developed in Link 1983 or the analysis of questions found in Groenendijk/Stokhof 1982 over the approach based on power sets and the QUERY operator, respectively. These approaches are also consistent with the point that I want to concentrate on with respect to the formula in (42)-that is, the instantiation of the context-dependent predicate (R).</rawString>

<title>Note that it follows from the narrow-scope analysis of tense developed in Section 4 that the time at which the set of objects x are ships need not be the same as the time at which that set of objects is in the Indian Ocean. This aspect of (42) may strike the reader as counterintuitive. Notice, however, that (42) represents the first level of translation (the EFL level of Figure 2 with no input from the domain model). It will be part of the domain knowledge, however, that there are two kinds of properties: a. properties such as being an admiral, which can hold of an individual for certain subperiods; and b. properties such as being a ship, which hold of an entity throughout its existence.

<title>I am indebted to Bonnie Webber for pointing out to me that the discourse entity evoked by (45a) can be used to restrict the interpretation of the noun phrase which ships in (45c), only if the answer to (45a) is affirmative. Thus, whether a discourse entity can serve as a restrictor for the interpretation of subsequent NP&apos;s is in part a function of the type of sentence that evokes the discourse entity. If the expression that evokes a discourse entity occurs in a declarative sentence, the discourse entity will automatically be available as a potential restrictor for the interpretation of subsequent NPs. However, if the discourse entity is evoked within an interrogative sentence and the existence of the entity is not already presupposed by the question, the discourse entity is licensed as a potential restrictor, only if the question has an affirmative answer.</title>
