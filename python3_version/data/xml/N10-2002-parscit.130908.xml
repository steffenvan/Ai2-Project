Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999612">
This demo describes the summarization of
textual material about locations in the context
of a geo-spatial information display system.
When the amount of associated textual data is
large, it is organized and summarized before
display. A hierarchical summarization frame-
work, conditioned on the small space availa-
ble for display, has been fully implemented.
Snapshots of the system, with narrative de-
scriptions, demonstrate our results.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999939525">
Geospatial display systems are increasingly gain-
ing attention, given the large amounts of geospatial
data and services available online. Although geos-
patial imagery and maps show geometric relations
among entities, they cannot be used to present oth-
er kinds of knowledge about the temporal, topic,
and other conceptual relations and entities. Given
an entity on a map, a description of what happened
there, in what order in time, when, and why, re-
quires additional types of information, typically
contained in text, in order to support varied search
and decision tasks.
In this demo, we apply text summarization to a
geo-spatial information display system with poten-
tially large amounts of textual data. By summariz-
ing the textual material linked to each location, we
demonstrate the ways one can organize this ma-
terial for optimal display and search.
Of the many different types of text-oriented re-
sources available, some are structured and others
unstructured. This textual data can be linked to
locations based on different reasons (containing
place names, addresses, real objects with geo-
graphical features, etc.). Appropriately grouping
and presenting the different aspects of the textual
information in summarization is a challenging task.
A second challenge stems from the huge amounts
of web material related to some geographical ob-
jects. For example, one may find millions of pages
for a famous place or event at a specific map loca-
tion. Given the common limitations of display
space in most geospatial display systems, one must
also design the interface to support dynamic
browsing and search.
All these challenges bring new problems to exist-
ing summarization techniques. In the following
sections, we demonstrate a hierarchical summari-
zation framework that reduces displayed text and
fully utilizes the small display space available for
textual information.

Associating each news page individually to its lo-
cation(s) may overwhelm the amount of informa-
tion displayable at any point and thereby limit the
scalability of the system. Existing systems pre-
sented in (Teitler et al., 2008) and GeoTracker
(Chen et al, 2007) organize material (at the area
level) by time instead of somehow aggregating
over larger numbers of related content. Since fre-
quently the associated news contents overlap at
least in part, a natural solution is to aggregate the
content somehow to remove duplication. Moreo-
ver, the aggregation of news provides a global
view of the textual information about the specific

location. Our system is the first available geo-
spatial text aggregation system to our knowledge.
Within geospatial display systems, the space avail-
able to display textual information is often quite
limited. We therefore need to summarize the most
important and relevant information about each lo-
cation, drawing from all the web pages linked to it.
However, directly applying a multi-document
summarization (Lin and Hovy, 2001) to the web
pages will generate poor results, due to unrelated
titles, duplicate articles, and noisy contents con-
tained in web pages. When several different events
have occurred at a location, more than one distinct
summary may be needed. It is therefore important
to deploy topic recognition (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
and/or topic clustering (Osinski and Weiss, 2005)
to identify and group relevant pieces of each text
into single-topic ‘chunks’. We develop a novel
hierarchical summarization system to improve the
interactivity and browsability.

3.1 Content Extraction and Summarization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939347826087">
Multi-webpage summarization is different from
traditional multi-doc summarization. First, most
web pages are much more complex than pure text
documents. Since the web contains a combination
of types of information—static text, image, videos,
dynamic layout, etc.—even a single page can be
treated as multiple documents. Current linking
functions are based on keywords, making the rele-
vant content of each relevant web page only a li-
mited block within the page. Second, our task is
oriented to locations, and hence differs from gen-
eral content summarization. Hence, we need to
identify and extract the essential part(s) of the
webpage linked to the geospatial imagery for
summarization and display. In our work, we utilize
two important features, layout and semantics, to
identify and extract the relevant content.
By rendering each web page into a DOM tree, we
segment the page into large blocks based on its
layout, including header, footer, left bar, right bar,
main block, etc. We implemented a rule-based ex-
tractor to extract the most relevant block from the
web page based on the relevance to the location.
</bodyText>

3.2 Clustering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968612903226">
Given a list of text blocks relevant to a local point
of interest, one can employ traditional text summa-
rization techniques to produce a short summary for
each one. This solution may not be helpful, how-
ever, since a long list of pages associated with each
point of interest would be very hard for users to
browse. Especially when the space allocated to text
display by the geospatial system is also limited, a
high compression ratio is typically required for the
summarization system.
The solution we adopt is to deploy cluster-based
multi-document summarization. Clustering must
observe two criteria: first, the location of interest,
and second, the text topic. Different clustering me-
thods can be employed. To delimit topics, a simple
heuristic is to introduce as additional criterion the
event/article date: when the difference in document
dates within a topical cluster is (far) larger than the
actual duration of the topic event, we are probably
dealing with multiple separate events at the same
location. Better performance is obtained by using a
topic detection module first, and then clustering
documents based on the topics identified.
Unfortunately, documents usually contain multiple
locations and multiple topics. The problem of ‘top-
ic drift’ can cause confusion in a short summary.
As in (Hearst, 1997), we segment each document
into several ‘mini-documents’, each one devoted to
a single topic, and then to perform location- and
topic-based clustering over the (now larger) set of
mini-documents.

3.3 Hierarchical Summary Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987066666667">
Whatever the clustering approach, the result is a
potentially rather large set of individual topics as-
sociated with each location. Since screen space for
the summaries may be very limited next to the
maps / imagery, they have to be formatted and pre-
sented for maximal interpretability. To address this
problem, we adopt a hierarchical structure to dis-
play incrementally longer summaries for each loca-
tion of interest. At present we have found three
levels of incrementally longer summaries to be
most useful.
Thumbnail: a very short ‘topic’ that characte-
rizes the (clusters of) documents or segments asso-
ciated with each location. We present essentially
one or two single keywords -- the most informative

words for each cluster. We implemented a new
version of our topic signature technology, one that
uses tf.idf instead of the entropy ratio, as scoring
measure to rank each cluster’s words.
Title: a headline-length phrase or short sen-
tence (or two). The original titles of the web pages
are often noisy or even unrelated to the current top-
ic cluster. Sometimes, the title may be meaningless
(it might for example contain the website’s name
“Pr Newswire”), or two different web pages may
share the same title. We implemented a topic-
related headline generator based on our previous
work (Lin and Hovy, 2000) by incorporating a top-
ic-based selector.
Snippet: a paragraph-length excerpt characteriz-
ing the cluster. To produce paragraph-length sum-
maries, we implemented an extraction-based text
summarizer. We built a new version of previously
investigated technology (Lin and Hovy, 2001),
implementing several sentence scoring techniques
and a score combination function.

The user can enter an address in the top search
box, or search by business name. The system then
centers the imagery at that address or business.
Clicking on “Get Features” invokes the web ser-
vices to get all features about the displayed image
and displays the features in the “AREA: Features
Found” list, and also draws them as points on the
maps.
The user can explore the map using the navigation
controller. On clicking the marker of an identified
building, an information window pops up contain-
ing the associated structured web information
(building name, business type, website, online im-
ages, and so on), as shown in Figure 2.

Clicking on “Get News” retrieves all news related
to the displayed features; features with associated
news show a small newspaper icon (see next to
“Sony Pictures Entertainment” in Figure 4). Click-

with the feature, sorted by date.
The hierarchical summarization system, described
in this paper extends the GeoXRAY system to
show a summarized view of the news. The user can
click on the “Cluster News” link. The results are
displayed in a tree, showing the title of the cluster
(thumbnail and title), under which appears a small
summary of the cluster, under which appear links
to all the news articles belonging to that cluster.

the 126 news articles that contain the words “Sony
Pictures Entertainment”. As described above, these
documents are clustered based on topics. Using our
current parameter settings, 20 multi-result clusters
are formed, leaving 34 results unclustered. (The
size of clusters, or the number of clusters desired,
can be varied by the user.) As mentioned above,
each cluster is presented to the users by a minimal
length thumbnail summary consisting of a few cha-
racteristic keywords; a partial list of these is shown
in Figure 3(b). Figure 3(c) shows the result of se-
lecting the cluster labeled “solar electrical system”
(second from the bottom in Figure 3(b)), which
contains two results. The summary contains the 5
top-ranked sentences from the two documents, pre-
sented in document order. In addition, the sum-
mary includes two hyperlinks to the two full texts
for further inspection.

The summary illustrates some of the strengths but
also the shortcomings of the current system. It is
clearly about a solar energy system installed in
2007 on top of the Jimmy Stewart Building by EI
Solutions. This is enough detail for a user to de-
termine whether or not to read the texts any fur-
ther. However, two of the extracted sentences are
not satisfactory: sentence 2 is broken off and sen-
tence 3 should not be part of the news text at all.
Premature sentence breaks result from inadequate
punctuation and line break processing, which is
still a research problem exacerbated by the com-
plexity of web pages.
By showing the summary results, we merely dem-
onstrate the improvement on browsability of the
search system. We are relatively satisfied with the
results. While the summaries are not always very
good, they are uniformly understandable and com-
pletely adequate to prove that one can combine
geospatial information access and text summariza-
tion in a usable and coherent manner.

All these challenges bring new problems to existing summarization techniques. In the following sections, we demonstrate a hierarchical summarization framework that reduces displayed text and fully utilizes the small display space available for textual information. 2 Related Work Associating each news page individually to its location(s) may overwhelm the amount of information displayable at any point and thereby limit the scalability of the system. Existing systems presented in (Teitler et al., 2008) and GeoTracker (Chen et al, 2007) organize material (at the area level) by time instead of somehow aggregating over larger numbers of related content. Since frequently the associated news contents overlap at least in part, a natural solution is to aggregate the content somehow to remove duplication. Moreover, the aggregation of news provides a global view of the textual information about the specific 5 Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2010: Demonstration Session, pages 5–8, Los Angeles, California, June 2010. c�2010 Association for Computational Linguistics location.
