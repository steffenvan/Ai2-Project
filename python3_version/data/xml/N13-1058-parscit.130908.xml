This paper examines the efficacy of the appli-
cation of a pre-existing technique in the area
of event-event temporal relationship identifi-
cation. We attempt to both reproduce the re-
sults of said technique, as well as extend the
previous work with application to a newly-
created domain of biographical data. We find
that initially the simpler feature sets perform
as expected, but that the final improvement to
the feature set underperforms. In response, we
provide an analysis of the individual features
and identify differences existing between two
corpora.

<bodyText confidence="0.999990857142857">
As natural language systems continue to grow,
so too does the importance of extracting temporal
information from text. Narratives often contain a
wealth of temporal information, linking specific
events to each other and to individual named enti-
ties of importance, but such information is often
implicitly conveyed, rather than explicitly stated.
The continued interest in Question Answering and
other data extraction systems has emphasized the
need to better understand these relations to move
past superficial understanding to a level of deeper
comprehension. For native speakers, the temporal
clues hidden in the text are relatively simple to
comprehend. However, even for human annotators,
the task of identifying and classifying the specific
relationship between two events can be problemat-
ic. This complexity, of course, only exacerbates the
problem of trying to automate the process for any
information extraction system.
The creation of the TimeBank Corpus
(Pustejovsky et al, 2003a), a fully-annotated
newswire domain, opened up the possibility of ap-
plying machine learning techniques to the task of
automatically extracting temporal relations. We
look to the standards of the TimeBank Corpus to
create a corpus of biographical accounts, and apply
techniques that have been shown to work on
TimeBank to the new domain.

Domain-independent approaches have often
focused on events that can be bound to a global
timeline (Mani et al, 2003). This includes dates and
times, but often neglects phrases that indicate
events occurring in relative time (e.g. “during
school,” “before the crash,” or “recently”). Re-
search conducted on news articles attempted to
identify the specific temporal relationships be-
tween two events, as seen in (Mani et al, 2006).
Further work in that domain extended this start by
identifying additional features that better predicted
those temporal relations. (Lapata &amp; Lascarides
2007; Chambers et al, 2007).
In this work, we are primarily interested in
applying event ordering techniques to documents
less structured than news articles, specifically bi-
ographies. It is the intention of our work to validate
the efficacy of previous techniques in a different
domain, and thus we attempt to extend the work
completed by Chambers et al through application
to a newly created corpus of biographical data. In
the previous work, Chambers reports best results of
59.43% accuracy with gold standard features on
TimeBank. We attempt to reproduce these results,
and also adopt the policy of including incremental
results against features selected based on the work

3 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993925">
For purposes of validation of our implementa-
tion, we adopt the use of the TimeBank corpus
(v1.1), which consists of 186 newswire documents
and 3,406 identified event pairs with temporal rela-
tionships. The number of identified event pairs
differs slightly from the previous work, which re-
ports only 3,345. We cannot account for this dis-
crepancy.
Furthermore, we oversee the creation of the
Bio Corpus, consisting of 17 biographical accounts
and annotated with 1,594 event pairs. Despite the
small size of the corpus, we feel that the greatly
increased event relationship density of our samples
compared to a similar number of TimeBank docu-
ments offsets the disadvantage of the small docu-
ment count.
The accounts are drawn from those available at
Biography.com, and describe multiple aspects of
the subject’s life. Because the style of the biog-
raphies tends to explore one aspect of life fully,
before moving on to another, we frequently see
references to events contained in previous sections.
These relations, which are not only across sentence
boundaries but often in entirely different para-
graphs, are one of the most striking differences
between TimeBank documents and those of the
new corpus.
To prepare the corpus, each document was au-
tomatically event tagged through the adoption of
EVITA, the Events in Text Analyzer (Sauri et al,
2005). EVITA was previously found to perform
with 80.12% accuracy, a result comparable to the
accuracy of graduate student annotators with basic
training. The temporal relations between event
pairs were then hand-annotated according to the
TimeML standard (Pustejovsky et al, 2003b).

4 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999585423076923">
In an attempt to reproduce the event relation-
ship classification techniques of the previous work,
we first implement the approach and test it on our
version of the TimeBank corpus. We then demon-
strate that the validated techniques are applicable
to the biographical domain, and that where dis-
crepancies do occur, the specific feature set can be
modified to elicit improvements not seen in the
TimeBank data. In all possible cases we utilize the
same techniques and tools as the earlier work, ex-
cept where sufficient information is lacking, such
as in the specific implementation of the machine
learning techniques. In such situations, assump-
tions are made as deemed necessary.
Chambers’ work attempts to identify the rela-
tionships between event pairs according to a previ-
ously defined set consisting of Before, iBefore,
Includes, Begins, Ends, and Simultaneous. The set
of event pairs are pre-selected and chosen for
preexisting relationships, so a classification of No
Relation is not required. In order to achieve classi-
fication, a support vector machine (SVM) is im-
plemented via the Library for Support Vector
Machines (Chang &amp; Lin, 2011) and is trained on
an extensive set of thirty-five features, as detailed
below.

The feature set was incrementally built by a
number of previous experiments, as detailed in
Table 1, above. Initially, five temporal attributes
originally identified by TimeML as having tem-
poral significance, are adopted. These include the
tense, aspect, and class of each event, as well as
the modality and polarity of each. However, per
the previous work, which demonstrated modality
and polarity performing with high majority base-
lines, we exclude them from consideration. While
Chambers et al include the task of automating the
identification of these features, we report results
versus the gold standards taken from TimeBank.
Mani et al (2006) added features indicating an
agreement between the two events in the case of
tense and aspect, and Chambers extends this to
include a class agreement variable. In addition to
simple agreement, bigrams of tense, aspect, and
class are first included by Chambers to more fully
represent the relationship between the event attrib-
utes (e.g. &amp;quot;Past Present,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Perfect Prog&amp;quot;).

selves, extracted verbatim, and the corresponding

Also included are the parts-of-speech for both
event words, the two words immediately preceding
each event, and that of the token immediately fol-
lowing the events. Bigrams for part-of-speech from
each event and its preceding token are also includ-
ed, as well as a bigram for the part-of-speech of the
two events as related to each other.
Lapata and Lascarides (2006) first added a fea-
ture indicating whether or not two events were in a
subordinate relationship, which Chambers&apos; in-
cludes, and extends it with the addition of one in-
dicating a dominating relationship. This
information is extracted by considering the parse
tree as defined by an intermediate stage of the
Stanford Parser. Similar to these two linguistic or-
dering features, we include another feature indicat-
ing the textual ordering of the two events (true if
Event 1 is before Event 2, and false if not), and one
indicating whether the two events are intra- or in-
ter- sentential (same sentence or different sentenc-
es). Finally, we adopt Chambers&apos; use of a feature
for identifying whether or not each event is a part
of a prepositional phrase.
All of these features are extracted from the text
via regular expressions and application of the
aforementioned third-party tools (such as WordNet
and the Stanford Parser). With the features extract-
ed, the first experiment on TimeBank uses only
those features identified by Mani et al. Experi-
ments two and three incrementally grow the fea-
ture set with those identified by Lapata &amp;
Lascarides and Chambers, respectively. The fea-
ture sets can be seen in Table 1, above. Results of
this reproduction of the previous work are used as
a point of comparison to the results of classifica-
tion on our own Bio Corpus, using the same in-
cremental growth classification scheme as before.
Furthermore, we provide independent feature
analysis of a selection of the new features added by
Chambers over the Mani+Lapata set, leveraging
the results to draw some conclusions as to the lin-
guistic differences existing between the two corpo-
ra.

5 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987443275862069">
We first perform classification on TimeBank
with the feature set attributed to Mani, the results
of which can be seen in Table 2. Our system re-
turns an accuracy of 51.97%, outperforming
Chambers’ reported result by one full point. This
over-performance is extended to the Lapata feature
set in a 1.82 point increase over our results for
Mani’s features, versus the 1.32 increase seen in
Chambers’ reported results, which at least main-
tains a similar magnitude of improvement.
With the full set of features, including Cham-
bers’ additions, our system exhibits a reversal in
the previous trend of over-performance. As seen in
Table 2, when Chambers’ reported results of
60.45%, our own system returns results of only
58.22%. Not only does this leave a void of over
two percent between the expected and actual accu-
racies, but it represents a much smaller increase in
performance between Lapata’s and Chambers’ fea-
ture sets on Bio. In an effort to identify an under-
performing feature, although without point of
comparison from previous work, we explore an
independent analysis of the new features, and
found all features to be performing with at least
some measure of improvement, as can be seen in
Table 3.
Mani’s feature set, when applied to the Bio
Corpus, returns similar results as on TimeBank,
with slightly higher accuracy at 53.14%. This
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999915964285714">
translates to a smaller improvement over the base-
line than we see in the newswire domain, but main-
tains approximately the same level of accuracy.
Also following the same trend that is exhibited on
TimeBank, the new features attributed to Lapata
yield results with a small degree of improvement
over the expected values at 55.4% versus Time-
Bank’s 53.79%.
The application of the full feature set returns
the expected reversal of trend, but underperforms
by an even greater degree at 56.65%, leading us to
suspect linguistic differences between the two cor-
pora. In an effort to confirm this, we perform the
same independent feature analysis as we performed
on TimeBank. Notable results of re-classification
(seen in Table 3) came from the part-of-speech
features, as well as from the prepositional phrase
heads. Part-of-speech was found to degrade per-
formance and drop accuracy from 55.40% to
54.77%. Omission of the part-of-speech from a full
feature set classification does not, however, im-
prove performance over the initial classification.
The prepositional phrase feature, on the other
hand, returned the opposite result from part-of-
speech – an improvement over the full feature set
accuracy at 57.34%, strongly suggesting the im-
portance of prepositional phrases in classification
in the Bio Corpus.

<bodyText confidence="0.999990574468086">
On TimeBank, results of temporal relationship
classification return results similar to what was
expected. In the simpler feature sets of Mani and
Lapata, our own experiments over-perform by a
small margin in each case, maintaining a similar
magnitude of improvement at each step. This small
but interesting variation is likely the result of the
61 additional event pairs in our version of the
TimeBank corpus. Given our lack of justification
for the difference, this claim is merely speculative.
On the final feature set, with the inclusion of all
features set out by Chambers, we still see a small
improvement over the prior feature sets, but a
small magnitude of change, coming in at a high of
58.22% compared to Chambers’ 60.45%. While
still reasonable, a sudden underperformance com-
pared to the previous slight over-performances is
unusual. Justification for this discrepancy could be
attributed to the differences in the data set, but
there is also a possibility that ambiguity in the de-
scription of the features led to improper extraction
techniques. Our analysis of the individual feature
fails to return what we can identify as an under-
performing feature, however.
In the case of the Bio Corpus, we initially see a
similar trend in performance, with the feature sets
attributed to Mani and Lapata performing as ex-
pected, while the full Chambers set returns a less
than impressive result. Additional analysis of the
individual improvements from Chambers’ new
features, however, identifies two outliers to per-
formance on Bio. The underperformance of part-
of-speech, and the surprising improvement based
solely on the prepositional phrase feature, would
suggest different linguistic trends between the two
corpora.
In future explorations of this topic, we would
like to expand the size of the biographical corpus
and reaffirm its correctness through the use of
cross-validation between multiple annotators. This
would help to ensure that no unintentional biases
have skewed our results. In addition, we would like
to further investigate feature selection to find a
best-case subset for performance on the Bio cor-
pus. While we initially began such an analysis, the
sheer number of potential combinations rendered it
outside of the scope of this work.

In this work, we are primarily interested in applying event ordering techniques to documents less structured than news articles, specifically biographies. It is the intention of our work to validate the efficacy of previous techniques in a different domain, and thus we attempt to extend the work completed by Chambers et al through application to a newly created corpus of biographical data. In the previous work, Ch</context>

Initially, five temporal attributes originally identified by TimeML as having temporal significance, are adopted. These include the tense, aspect, and class of each event, as well as the modality and polarity of each. However, per the previous work, which demonstrated modality and polarity performing with high majority baselines, we exclude them from consideration. While Chambers et al include the task of automating the identification of these features, we report results versus the gold standards taken from TimeBank. Mani et al (2006) added features indicating an agreement between the two events in the case of tense and aspect, and Chambers extends this to include a class agreement variable. In addition to simple agreement, bigrams of tense, aspect, and class are first included by Chambers to more fully represent the relationship between the event attributes (e.g. &amp;quot;Past Present,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Perfect Prog&amp;quot;). Next to be included are the event strings themselves, extracted verbatim, and the corresponding 530 Baseline Mani Lapata Chambers TimeBank – Chambers 37.22 50.97 52.29 60.45 TimeBank – New 37.11 51.97 53.79 58.22 Bio Corpus 45.67 </context>

For native speakers, the temporal clues hidden in the text are relatively simple to comprehend. However, even for human annotators, the task of identifying and classifying the specific relationship between two events can be problematic. This complexity, of course, only exacerbates the problem of trying to automate the process for any information extraction system. The creation of the TimeBank Corpus (Pustejovsky et al, 2003a), a fully-annotated newswire domain, opened up the possibility of applying machine learning techniques to the task of automatically extracting temporal relations.
