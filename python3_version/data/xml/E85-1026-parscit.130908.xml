The present paper provides a report on
a new system of an automated morphemic
analysis of technical texts in Czech as
a hiEhly inflectional language, which is
being prepared by the linguistic team of
the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in
Prague, within the project of man-machine
communication without a pre-arranged data
base (TIBAQ). The kind of morphemic
analysis presented here is based on
a retrograde (right-to-left) analysis of
words by means of morphemically unambi-
guous or irresolvably ambiguous word-ends,
which do not coincide with the etymologi-
cal word-endina7s but correspond to the
structure of the accidental cases of
mornhemic ambiguity in an inflectional
language (word-endings being accountable
for in a certain way by word-ends). The
algorithm of analysis can thus dispense
with any dictionary (of morphemic
Irregularities and exceptions), economi-
cally accounting especially for productive
word-endings. The word-ends of the
analysis are assigned several kinds of
morphemic information, concerning
morphemic categories and lemmatization.
The analysis is based on the absolute
frequency of word-ends in technical texts
and able to interact with the semantic
analyeis.

The ,Iresent paper provides a report on
a new system of an automated morphemic
analysis of technical texts in Czech,
which is being prepared by the linguistic
team of the Faculty of Mathematics and
-hyaice in rraEue. The morphemic enalysis
of Czech, which is a highly inflectional
lanEuage, constitutes the starting point
fse. any kind of automated processing of
raning from automatic
information retrieval to natural language
understanding.
There is a previous project of morphe-
mic analysis of Czech described in
(7;eisheitelova, Xralikova and 3gall,
1982), which is based on an analLsis of
etymological word-stems and word-endings
(suffixes). The present system, on the
other hand, is based on a retrograde
(right-to-left) analysis of words, which
makes it nossible to dispense both with
the dictionary of stems and the dictiona-
ry of endings; it was partly inspired ta
the system MOSAIC (Kirschner, 1982)
(intended first of all for automatic
indexing of technical texts), which is
also based on a kind of retrograde
analysis; namely, on singling out the
four rightmost symbols of the word-forms
of autosemantic words, which are then
matched against a list of word-endinrs.
This kind of analysis, however, cannot
avoid the danger of ambiguity, which is
prevented by a number of ad-hoc
restrictions, for example reducing the
universe of discourse.
The present system of morpnemic
analysis differs from the previous ones
in several essential respects:
(i) The algorithm of the present type
of morphemic analysis can be viewed as
a structured list of morphemically un-
ambiguous or irresolvably ambiguous
word-ends of Czech words (which may be
accidentally identical with full word-
forms) including information concerning
their morphemic categories and leLnati-
zation. We believe that this princirle
can be considered as adequate for the
morphemic analysis of any inflectional
language.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.910179761904762">
(ii) In the present system, it is also
easier to carry out lemmatization: there
are only several tens of simple end
highly general lemmatization rules
appended to the morphemic information
accompanying every word-end in the
algorithm.
(iii) In the present system, the burden
of the analysis lies entirely on the
algorithm. There is no need of any
dictionary in which etymological irreo7u-
larities would be listed.
(iv) The algorithm is based on the
absolute freqUency of word-ends in
technical texts. It consists of two
parts; the first of them involves about
two hundred word-ends by means of which
it is possible to resolve about fifty
percent of a technical text.
(v) By means of the algorithm it is
possible to analyze an unlimited number

<bodyText confidence="0.999941285714286">
.of new (newly coined) words with product-
ive etymological word-endings. Thus, both
the user and the linguist are relieved of
the work which must be usually done when
a new lexical item is being incorporated
into a system of morphemic analysis of an
inflectional language.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.972686083333333">
(vi) The algorithm is going to be
implemented in PL/I within a system of
natural language understanding, namely
the project of man-machine communication
called TIBAQ (Text-and-Inference Based
Answering of Questions, cf. (Haji6ova
and Sga11,1981)) with no pre-arranged
data base and with the capacity of self-
-enriching by information drawn from the
text; the project is based on the
linguistic theory of the Functional
Generative Description.
(vii) Underlying the algorithm is
a large amount of empirical work; it
analyzes several tens of thousands of
(autosemantic and synsemantic) words
(drawn from a retrograde dictionary of
Czech, of. (S1avt6kova, 1975)), including
the word-forms of inflected words. The
choice of the autosemantic lexical units
to be analyzed was carried out with
respect to technical texts concerning
microelectronics.
2. THE PHILCSOPHY OF THE SYSTEM
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999416677419355">
The major novelty of the present
approach consists in the conception of
(morphemically unambiguous or irresol-
vably ambiguous) word-ends, which do not
correspond to the (etymological) word-
-inflection and word-formation endings
but to the cases of accidental morphemic
ambiguity in an inflectional language,
every word-ending being accountable for
by at least one word-end (piece of output
information). On the other hand, every
word-end corresponds to (stands for) at
least one lexical word, and due to the
cases of morphemic ambiguity, it repre-
sents at least one word-form. A word-end
ia usually equivalent to a part of a
word-form, but accidentally it may be
equivalent to a full word-form.
The algorithm of analysis, embodying
a, conception of procedural morphemics,
can be viewed as a structured list of
word-ends arranged in a branching struct-
ure consisting of yea-no answers to
queries, with corresporiaing sequences
(strings) of symbols of increasing
length, which is due to the retrograde
adding of symbols (we use 40 letters
of the Czech alphabet, including the
ones with diacritics), until morphemi-
cally unambiguous or irresolvably
ambiguous word-ends are found (morphemic
ambiguity counting as a valid result of
the analysis, since it can be resolved,
in most cases, by means of the syntactic
analysis). The word-ends are assigned
the kinds of information as described in
section 3.
In the present system of morphemic ana-
lysis, there is no place for the notion of
(etymological) irregularity, all word-ends
being equally &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot;; the differences
between them can be accounted for e.g. in
terms of their length or of their positi-
ons on the scale of absolute frequency
(cf. section 5). It may even be the case
that an etymologically highly irregular
word-form can be analyzed by a relatively
small number of symbols (of its word-end),
and the other way round.
In the horizontal progress of the algo-
rithm (which corresponds to the answer
xfts - a new symbol is added) the output
-1H-formation concerns a single word-end,
while in the vertical progress (corres-
ponding to the answer no - different sym-
bols than the one(s) in question are
added) it usually concerns more than one
word-end. These word-ends can be labelled
as complementary word-ends with respect
to the horizontal word-end(s) in question;
they consist of the same sequence of
symbols as the correlated horizontal word-
-ends with the exception of their respect-
ive leftmost symbols, which belong to the
complementary set of symbols of the alpha-
bet with respect to the leftmost symbol(s)
of the horizontal word-end(s), according
to the combinatorics of letters in exist-
ing Czech words (for example, the comple-
mentary word-ends to the horizontal word-
-ends Air, Um5r,im.er are only four:
am6r, omer umer (the symbol /
=as= tfirelld-ZT-the word, i.e. indi-
cates a word-end in the form of a full
word-form)). Throughout the algorithm,
the notation concerning the complementary
word-ends is abbreviated in that in their
place only their common output informat-
ion is written (cf. the three occurrences
of A in Figure 1 below).
The conception just discussed can be
illustrated by a chunk of the algorithm
accounting for the frequent word- .
-inflection ending (which is an adje-
ctival word-ending, ambiguous among nomi-
native and accusative singular masculine-
-inanimate, and nominative singular
masculine-animate, thus representing the
adjectival &amp;quot;normal form&amp;quot;), which clas&apos;aes
only with Lai (adverb), being accounted
for by the three occurrences of the out-
put information A (standing for the mor-
phemic information in question) in ngurel.

3. KINDS OF INFORMATION
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991542952830189">
The word-ends (i.e. the horizontal
word-ends and the complementary word-ends
with respect to the given horizontal
word-ends) are assigned the following
kinds of information.
A. 7.orphemic information.
(i) The information concerning part-of-
-speech categories includes the distinct-
ion between Nouns, Verbs (these kinds of
information are further subcategorized),
Adjectives (A), Adverbs (B), Prepositions
(C), Conjunctions (D) and Pronouns (Zj)
(there are distinguished three kinds of
pronouns, namely those which function as
nouns, those which function- as adjectives,
and those which function both ways).
(ii) The information concerning gram-
matical categories includes the following
distinctions (with respect to the part-
-of-speech categories).
(a) Declension.
(aa) Case (six cases, indicated as 1,
2, 3, 4, 6 and 7) is distinguished not
only with nouns, but due to grammatical
agreement, also with adjectives and pro-
nouns.
(bb) Number (singular and plural, indi-
cated as sg and pl, respectively) is
distinguished with nouns, and due to
grammatical agreement, also with adjecti-
ves, pronouns and verbs.
(cc) Gender (combined with animateness)
is distinguished with nouns, and due to
grammatical agreement, partly also with
adjectives, pronouns and verbs (with
verbs, for example, in the past and pas-
sive participles plural). With nouns,.
four genders are distinguished: masculine-
-inanimate (N), masculine-animate (2),
feminine (F), and neuter (S). The cate-
gory of animateness is involved rather
with masculine than with feminine and
neuter nouns because with plural masculi-
ne nouns the difference in animateness is
present, due to grammatical agreement,
also with verbs and adjectives in the
above mentioned way, and because in tech-
nical texts substantially more masculine-
-animate than feminine-animate nouns are
found.
(b) Conjugation.
With verbs, there is distinguished
person (three persons, with the exception
stated in section 4), number (cf. (bb)
above), tense (present, past and future),
mood (indicative and imperative), and
voice (active and passive). As concerns
notation, usually several kinds of infor-
mation are collapsed in a single abbrevi-
ation, cf. K standing for the third per-
son singular active indicative present.
There is no need of information
concerning the inflectional types of
nouns, adjectives and verbs; for example
the word-ends corresponding to the class
of nouns represented by the word-forms
katodami (by cathodes) and vlastnostmi
(by properties) (both 7 pl) are assigned
the same morphemic information, though
the word-forms in question belong to
etymologically quite different types of
inflection of (feminine) nouns (cf. the
difference between the word-inflection
endings, ami and mi, respectively).
B. Lemmatization information.
Lemmatization, i.e. convering an in-
flected word-form into the normal form
(i.e. 1 sg with nouns, 1 sg masculine
with adjectives and pronouns, and the
infinitive form with verbs) has a speci-
fic purpose, being connected with those
applications of morphemic analysis which
concern the terminological elements of
technical texts (such as automatic inde-
xing).
In the present system, lemmatization
is carried out by a retrograde erasing of
a certain number of symbols (possibly
zero) and by adding a number of specific
symbols (possibly zero) to what has been
left after the erasing; in lemmatization
(unlike in the rest of the algorithm) we
work with diacritic marks as specific
symbols. In this way, lemmatization can
be accounted for by means of several
tens of simple and highly general rules,
cutting across the inflectional endings
and also across the inflectional types
of different part-of-speech categories.
It should be pointed out that lemmatizat-
ion concerns rather the concrete words
(word-forms) found in a text than the
word-ends themselves: though the majority
of the lemmatization rules operate on
word-ends (concerning usually only a part
of a word-end, which is close to a word-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993708">
181
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997532384615385">
-ending, cf. the symbol in the word-end
tody, corresponding to the word-form
katod-,) in exceptional cases, for e 1
xamp e
where the stem of a word is affected by an
alternation, the erasing may reach to the
left of the concrete word, i.e. behind the
word-end; cf. the word-end ste (consisting
of three symbols), which, with some
simplifications, unambiEuously indicates
a verb (K), but which is not sufficient
for the lemmatization of such verb-forms
as roste (grows) to their infinitives
(rATF-(-To crow)), where four rightmost
s7,77,12 of the concrete word should be
considered.
The rules of leamatization have general-
ly the form EX; abc...], where X stands
for the number of the symbols to be
erased, and abc..., for the specific
symbols to be added. In the algorithm, the
rules are usually referred to by numbers,
and listed in an appendix. Thus, for
example, Rule 2 (El; a]) converts katod,
(cathodes; F 2 sg 1 .e 4 pl) into katoda
(cathode; F 1 sg) by erasing one sy3677--
(namely ;,:,) and by adding one symbol
(namely a). (;, stands for the relation of
ambiguity).
:very lemmatization rule has at least
one aPplication to various tyres of
mor-hemic categories concerning not only
different distinctions within a single
part-of-speech category (typically,
different genders with nouns) but also
different part-of-speech categories
(for example, a single lemmatization rule
can be applied to nouns, adjectives, and
verls;: this means that a lemmatization
rule may concern, in any of the part-of-
speech categories in question, more than
an.. word-ending (e.g. of different gender),
and these word-endings may be in tarn
ambiguoue between various case-and-number
aeeigne.ents.
f.e.a can be illustrated by Rule 6 and
aule 3. ault. 6 (El; - erase one
eyml:ol, add nothing) cuts across nouns,
adjectivez, and verbs, converting e.g.
eee4e (communicaticns) to spoj (communi-
o-tion,; (ly to :,oung
...) to 4.:;7L (young), and yysat4- (sucked
to ,i777-5(&apos;- &apos;Lick uo). Rule d
(P; - erase two symbols, add nothing)
&apos;plications (to all genders of
nouns and to ad,jectivoa) and corresponds,
on the whole, to 16 word-endings, out of
which two arc two-ways ambiguous as
concerns caee and number. The 16 word-
-eudin,s are illustrated by the word-
-ore in Figure 2 (where obvod . cir-
cuit, odbornik = expert, kl-Tcsaz

In the above survey, the words which
are assigned common information (e.g.
katodami, vlastnostmi, relacemi).belong
to etymolegically different types of in-
flection, which, however, need nct be
distinguished here: thour:h the lemmatiza-
tion rules can be arranged in a scale
according to their complexity or range cf
application, the present method of
lemmatization covers both simrle (recalar)
and complicated (irregular) types of
word-inflection and word-formation in
an equally economic manner.
C. Semantic information.
The semantic analysis by means of the
retrograde morphemic analysis is a yet
unfinished, but presumably smoothly
feasible task, which will be based on the
account of productive word-endings by
means of word-ends.
The considerations concerning the
semantic analysis should start from
establishing a set of semantic categories
(classes) of nouns and -ssibly also
adjectives which are considered to be
relevant for the analysis of technical
texts. In addition to the cgnsiderTticn
of productive word-endings, there can be
also introduced into the algorithm such
word-ends which account for semantically
relevant but only restrictedly productive
word-formation endins (such
(meter)), if such word-ends have been
&amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; in the complementary word-ends
Of the algorithm (for example, it may
happen that a productive word-endinr:
coinciding with a single word-end (such
as tko, cf. below) is &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; in this
way77-
In establishing the set of semantic
categories, we can draw from (Turiiiova,
1980) and (Kirschner, 1983), prorosing
that there should be introduced for
example the category of Instrument (Tool)
(as expressed by the productive word-
-endings die, tko, a6, i6,&apos;aka, 6r, or,
and by the resTFrct7Ily productive
word-endin:s metr, =f, fon, and skop),
Action (Proce77)-(a-C-e7-kc7-ani, Ana,
eni, AE and z377 frorerty (est, ita
and ance), etc.
The information concerning semantic
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996407">
182
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.94281326">
analysis can be rendered by indicating
certain pieces of output information as
semantically relevant (with respect to the
classification of semantic categories),
but presumably it will be even possible to
state this kind of information essentially
only in an appendix to the algorithm. Such
an appendix should consist of the specifi-
cation that every word-end (this concerns
also complementary word-ends) whose right-
most symbols coincide with the word-ending
in question (because a word-end is usually
longer than, or identical to, the word-
ending which is accounted for by it) and
which is assigned certain morphemic infor-
mation (concerning usually gender)
corresponds to the semantic category in
question; of. all word-ends whose three
rightmost symbols are aci and which are.
assigned the output in=mation F 7 sg
2 pl (such as lad, which is &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; in
the complementary word-ends) correspond
to the semantic category of nouns of
action (in this case, aci is correlated
to the normal form with ace, which is the
Czech equivalent of the English ation).
Possible exceptions to the semantic infor-
mation concerning the word-ends which
account for the word-endings in question
should be indicated directly in the algo-
rithm (e.g. by superscripts in the output
information); for example, the above-
-reentioned nominal word-ending aci (which
systematically clashes with theectival
word-endind aci N F S 1, 4 sg t
1 sg F 2, 3, 6, 7 sg N F S
1, 4 pl, and thus is accounted for by
about 30 pieces of output information)
has about five semantic exceptions to it
(such as nadaci (nadace . grant, support
- Ilither-777.3n nor result of action)),
for which there should be established
word-ends in the algorithm, with
the indication, in the output information,
-&amp;quot; their semantic exceptionality (with
f,s.,.ct to the other word-ends whose
riEhtmot symbols are mei and which ore
.:.ssiEned the output in=ation in
auastion), i.e. of their non-membership
in the class of nouns of action.

of Czech, where only a single lexical
item (masculine-inanimate noun) is hypo-
thesized to occur, as corresponding to
the two surface normal forms (i.e.
masculine-inanimate and feminine), the
two surface genders accidentally yielding
ambiguity in the word-end (word-form)
Ifadky,
(cc) Ambiguity concerning gender in
combination with animateness (and case),
cf. the word-end /61en (member), which is
ambiguous between masculine-inanimate and
masculine-animate noun (N 1, 4 sg t
1 sg). (In the majority of the other
cases of the inflection of masculine
nouns, the ambiguity in animateness is
not accompanied by the case ambiguity.)
(e) Ambiguity concerning only case (and
number), not accompanied by any other
kinds of ambiguity, cf. the word-end tody
(F 2 sg S 1 ;, 4 pl).
(f) Systematic ambiguity concerning the
distinction between geographical names
and possessive adjectives derived from
lexically corresponding personal names,
of. the word-end /Bene5ova (N 2 sg
A N 2 sg; F 1 sg; 5 1, 4 pl: of Bene&apos;gov
of Bene E s).
(E) Ambiguity concerning lemmatization,
of. the word-end yvAil (K), corresponding
to a single word-form vyvAH, between
lemmatization rules (1; t) and [2; et],
corresponding to the infinitives vyvAftt
(to balance) and vyvAlet (to export),
respectively. Cf. also the surface-syntax
ambiguity in lemmatization with the
word-end /T:Adky (cf. (bb) above), which
is surface-syntax ambiguous in gender
(N: fAdek F: fadka).
The present treatment of ambiguity is
characteristic of the procedural
conception of morphemics in that the
method of accounting for every etymologi-
cal word-ending by means of at least one
word-end (piece of output information)
removes from the analysis the systematic
ambiguity as well as morphemic irregula-
rities (exceptions) concerning etymologi-
cal word-inflection and word-formation
endings, which have been usually treated
by means of various restrictions and
other ad-hoc means. :very case of the
systematic etymological ambiguity is
accountable for by several tens or even
hundreds of pieces of output information
(cf. the systematic ambiguity of the
word-formation ending aci as mentioned in
section 3, or that of TEg word-inflection
ending z among masculine-inanimate,
masculine-animate and feminine nouns with
additional morphemically irresolvable
ambiguity concerning case and number:
N 1, 4 7 pl Â§ t 4, 7 pl Â§ F 2 sg; 1, 4
pl); on the other hand, exceptions to
word-endings (in the form of word-ends
with different output information) are
accountable for by several pieces of
output information (cf. the word-inflect-
ion ending as mentioned in section 2,
which is accountable for by three pieces
of output information, representing one
exception, or the word-formation ending
eni as mentioned in section 5, which is
accountable for by five pieces of output
information, representing six except-
ions).
After resolving the cases of the syste-
matic etymological ambiguity and of
irregularity, it is possible to list the
remaining (about one hundred) cases of
morphemically irresolvable ambiguity
(with the exception of the case-number
ambiguity accompanying gender ambiguity);
such a list can be compared to the list
by (PanevovA, 1981) invo1vinc,m1Aguous
word-f&apos;..srms in Czech. FanevovA s list,
not being lexically restricted with
respect to specific applications, inclu-
des also proper names, words not occur-
ring in technical texts and forms not
analyzed by the present algorithm (such
as singular imperative with verbs), but
on the other hand, it consists only of
full word-forms, thus intersecting with
the present list, where first of all
ambiguous word-ends in the form of parts
of words are involved.

The present conception of the algorithm
of morphemic analysis is based on the
absolute frequency of word-ends in tech-
nical texts. In the ideal case, the word-
-ends should be arranged with respect to
the frequency of their last (rightmost),
last-but-one, etc., symbols - a task
which itself would require the aid of
a computer; for the time being, we must

<bodyText confidence="0.997064966101695">
work with an approximation, which makes
it necessary to divide the algorithm into
two parts according to the assumption
that the first two hundred word-ends on
the scale of absolute frequency, arranged
according to a statistical examination
concerning the whole word-ends, could
resolve about fifty percent of the words
of a technical text, while the other
word-ends of the algorithm (pieces of
output information), arranged according
to the frequency of their last symbols,
should resolve the remaining portion of
a technical text. We assume that out of
the about twenty thousand . pieces of
output information of the broadly concei-
ved nreliminary version of the algorithm,
only several thousands will be sufficient
to cover the words which may occur in
a standard technical text (this will lead
to a substantial reduction of the preli-
minary version of the algorithm).
The words included into the analysis
fall into four major semantic hyper-
-categories (not used in the semantic
analysis); (i) words with the most
general semantics (including the forms of
categorial verbs, Such as1221 (to be),
prepositions, such as v (ifiL- etc.);
(ii) general terms typical of technical
texts (such as metoda (method), sntem
(system), etc.)T-ciii) words specific
to the given technical domain, e.g.
microelectronics (such as katoda
(cathode), obvod (circuit), etc.), and
(iv) words 7777a1 of other (possibly
affiliated) domains (such as cihla
(&apos;rick), strecha (roof), etc.-Y.:â€”
The conception of the most frequent
two hundred word-ends (which are
arnanoed in a special algorithm) can be
illustrated by a list involving ten most
frequent word-ends; in Czech technical
texts, they belong to the first hy72er-
category. These word-ends are of throe
&apos;minds; (i) word-ends in the form of parts
of word-forms (which maL accidentally
coincide with etymological word-endings,
such as 1cl or 6ho); (ii) word-ends
in the form of Tirl word-forms (such os
Lee or /4e), and (iii) word-ends in the
form of parts of word-forms resolvable

We have described a not yet im-olementef
but promising system of a right-to-left
morphemic analysis intended for technical
texts in Czech and based on a conception
of morphemically unambignous or irresol-
vably ambiguous word-ends as embodying
the cases of morphemic ambiguity in an
inflectional language. The present system
seems to be more economic than the
previous systems (which are fully or
partly based on the conception of etymo-
logical word-endings (and word-stems) or
on the conception of word-ends as
consisting of a fixed, apriori established
number of symbols) in that it can dispense
with any dictionary as well as with the
notion of morphemic irregularity; more-
over, it is capable of an interaction
with the other levels of analysis, as
well as of various adjustments.
The advantages of the present system
vis-a-vis the previous systems can be
summarized as follows.
(i) Due to the fact that every set of
complementary word-ends (with respect to
the Liven horizontal word-end(s)) is
assigned a common piece of output infor-
mation, and also to the fact that even
a single word-end often corresoonds to
several words (lexical units) an(Vcr
to several word-forms, the number of th
pieces of output information necessary
for resolving a standard technical text
is presumably considerably lower than the
number of the word-forms of both inflect-
ed and uninflected words) occurring in
such a text.
(ii) The present system is able to
account for the word-forms of new (new1L
coined) words with productive word-
-endings automatically, without consi-
dering their stems.
(iii) The account of productive word-
-endings also enables to account for
semantically relevant word-endings by
indicating the semantically relevant
pieces of output information.

<abstract confidence="0.998911076836162">The present paper provides a report on a new system of an automated morphemic analysis of technical texts in Czech as inflectional language, which is being prepared by the linguistic team of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in Prague, within the project of man-machine communication without a pre-arranged data base (TIBAQ). The kind of morphemic analysis presented here is based on a retrograde (right-to-left) analysis of words by means of morphemically unambiguous or irresolvably ambiguous word-ends, which do not coincide with the etymological word-endina7s but correspond to the structure of the accidental cases of mornhemic ambiguity in an inflectional language (word-endings being accountable for in a certain way by word-ends). The algorithm of analysis can thus dispense with any dictionary (of morphemic Irregularities and exceptions), economically accounting especially for productive word-endings. The word-ends of the analysis are assigned several kinds of morphemic information, concerning morphemic categories and lemmatization. The analysis is based on the absolute frequency of word-ends in technical texts and able to interact with the semantic analyeis. 1. INTECDUCTION The ,Iresent paper provides a report on a new system of an automated morphemic analysis of technical texts in Czech, which is being prepared by the linguistic team of the Faculty of Mathematics and in rraEue. The morphemic enalysis of Czech, which is a highly inflectional lanEuage, constitutes the starting point any kind of automated processing of raning from automatic information retrieval to natural language is a of morphemic analysis of Czech described in (7;eisheitelova, Xralikova and 3gall, 1982), which is based on an analLsis of etymological word-stems and word-endings (suffixes). The present system, on the other hand, is based on a retrograde (right-to-left) analysis of words, which makes it nossible to dispense both with the dictionary of stems and the dictionaof endings; it was partly inspired the system MOSAIC (Kirschner, 1982) (intended first of all for automatic indexing of technical texts), which is also based on a kind of retrograde analysis; namely, on singling out the four rightmost symbols of the word-forms of autosemantic words, which are then matched against a list of word-endinrs. This kind of analysis, however, cannot avoid the danger of ambiguity, which is prevented by a number of ad-hoc restrictions, for example reducing the universe of discourse. The present system of morpnemic analysis differs from the previous ones in several essential respects: (i) The algorithm of the present type of morphemic analysis can be viewed as a structured list of morphemically unambiguous or irresolvably ambiguous word-ends of Czech words (which may be accidentally identical with full wordforms) including information concerning morphemic categories and leLnatibelieve that this princirle can be considered as adequate for the morphemic analysis of any inflectional language. (ii) In the present system, it is also easier to carry out lemmatization: there are only several tens of simple end highly general lemmatization rules appended to the morphemic information accompanying every word-end in the algorithm. (iii) In the present system, the burden of the analysis lies entirely on the algorithm. There is no need of any dictionary in which etymological irreo7ularities would be listed. (iv) The algorithm is based on the absolute freqUency of word-ends in technical texts. It consists of two parts; the first of them involves about two hundred word-ends by means of which it is possible to resolve about fifty percent of a technical text. (v) By means of the algorithm it is possible to analyze an unlimited number 179 .of new (newly coined) words with productive etymological word-endings. Thus, both the user and the linguist are relieved of the work which must be usually done when a new lexical item is being incorporated into a system of morphemic analysis of an inflectional language. (vi) The algorithm is going to be implemented in PL/I within a system of natural language understanding, namely the project of man-machine communication called TIBAQ (Text-and-Inference Based Answering of Questions, cf. (Haji6ova and Sga11,1981)) with no pre-arranged data base and with the capacity of self- -enriching by information drawn from the text; the project is based on the linguistic theory of the Functional Generative Description. (vii) Underlying the algorithm is a large amount of empirical work; it analyzes several tens of thousands of (autosemantic and synsemantic) words (drawn from a retrograde dictionary of Czech, of. (S1avt6kova, 1975)), including the word-forms of inflected words. The choice of the autosemantic lexical units to be analyzed was carried out with respect to technical texts concerning microelectronics. 2. THE PHILCSOPHY OF THE SYSTEM The major novelty of the present approach consists in the conception of (morphemically unambiguous or irresolvably ambiguous) word-ends, which do not correspond to the (etymological) word- -inflection and word-formation endings but to the cases of accidental morphemic ambiguity in an inflectional language, every word-ending being accountable for by at least one word-end (piece of output information). On the other hand, every word-end corresponds to (stands for) at least one lexical word, and due to the cases of morphemic ambiguity, it represents at least one word-form. A word-end ia usually equivalent to a part of a word-form, but accidentally it may be equivalent to a full word-form. The algorithm of analysis, embodying a, conception of procedural morphemics, can be viewed as a structured list of word-ends arranged in a branching structure consisting of yea-no answers to queries, with corresporiaing sequences (strings) of symbols of increasing length, which is due to the retrograde adding of symbols (we use 40 letters of the Czech alphabet, including the ones with diacritics), until morphemically unambiguous or irresolvably ambiguous word-ends are found (morphemic ambiguity counting as a valid result of the analysis, since it can be resolved, in most cases, by means of the syntactic analysis). The word-ends are assigned the kinds of information as described in In the present system of morphemic analysis, there is no place for the notion of (etymological) irregularity, all word-ends being equally &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot;; the differences between them can be accounted for e.g. in terms of their length or of their positions on the scale of absolute frequency (cf. section 5). It may even be the case that an etymologically highly irregular word-form can be analyzed by a relatively small number of symbols (of its word-end), and the other way round. In the horizontal progress of the algorithm (which corresponds to the answer new symbol is added) the output concerns a single word-end, while in the vertical progress (corresponding to the answer no different symbols than the one(s) in question are added) it usually concerns more than one word-end. These word-ends can be labelled as complementary word-ends with respect to the horizontal word-end(s) in question; they consist of the same sequence of symbols as the correlated horizontal word- -ends with the exception of their respective leftmost symbols, which belong to the complementary set of symbols of the alphabet with respect to the leftmost symbol(s) of the horizontal word-end(s), according to the combinatorics of letters in existing Czech words (for example, the complementary word-ends to the horizontal word- Air, are only four: am6r, omer umer (the symbol / word, i.e. indicates a word-end in the form of a full word-form)). Throughout the algorithm, the notation concerning the complementary word-ends is abbreviated in that in their place only their common output information is written (cf. the three occurrences of A in Figure 1 below). The conception just discussed can be illustrated by a chunk of the algorithm accounting for the frequent word- . -inflection ending (which is an adjectival word-ending, ambiguous among nominative and accusative singular masculine- -inanimate, and nominative singular masculine-animate, thus representing the adjectival &amp;quot;normal form&amp;quot;), which clas&apos;aes only with Lai (adverb), being accounted for by the three occurrences of the output information A (standing for the morphemic information in question) in ngurel. Figure 1. A chunk of the algorithm. /pr &apos;Y B 1 A A A The three occurrences of A in Figure 1 can be indicated, for the sake of clarity, â€¢ (corresponding to the 180 horizontal string 41) accounting for those Czech adjectives (in the given form) whose .penultimate symbol is different from r as velk.1%,(big)), (corresponding the horizontal string accounting those Czech the given form) whose second symbol from the right is r and whose third symbol from the right Zifferent from (such as and o the word-end for those Czech adjectives inthe given form) whose third and second symbols from the right are 2E, respectively, and whose fourth symbOl from the right is different from /, i.e. which are longer than three symbols (in Czech, there is only one such namely kyoil(loose, plump)). the whole, and for all Czech adjectives (in the given form). OF INFORMATION The word-ends (i.e. the horizontal word-ends and the complementary word-ends with respect to the given horizontal word-ends) are assigned the following kinds of information. A. 7.orphemic information. (i) The information concerning part-of- -speech categories includes the distinction between Nouns, Verbs (these kinds of information are further subcategorized), Adjectives (A), Adverbs (B), Prepositions (C), Conjunctions (D) and Pronouns (Zj) (there are distinguished three kinds of pronouns, namely those which function as nouns, those which functionas adjectives, and those which function both ways). (ii) The information concerning grammatical categories includes the following distinctions (with respect to the part- -of-speech categories). (a) Declension. (aa) Case (six cases, indicated as 1, 6 and 7) is distinguished not only with nouns, but due to grammatical agreement, also with adjectives and pronouns. (bb) Number (singular and plural, indicated as sg and pl, respectively) is distinguished with nouns, and due to grammatical agreement, also with adjectives, pronouns and verbs. (cc) Gender (combined with animateness) is distinguished with nouns, and due to grammatical agreement, partly also with adjectives, pronouns and verbs (with verbs, for example, in the past and passive participles plural). With nouns,. genders are distinguished: masculine- (2), feminine (F), and neuter (S). The category of animateness is involved rather with masculine than with feminine and neuter nouns because with plural masculine nouns the difference in animateness is present, due to grammatical agreement, also with verbs and adjectives in the above mentioned way, and because in technical texts substantially more masculine- -animate than feminine-animate nouns are found. (b) Conjugation. With verbs, there is distinguished person (three persons, with the exception stated in section 4), number (cf. (bb) above), tense (present, past and future), mood (indicative and imperative), and voice (active and passive). As concerns notation, usually several kinds of information are collapsed in a single abbreviation, cf. K standing for the third person singular active indicative present. There is no need of information concerning the inflectional types of nouns, adjectives and verbs; for example the word-ends corresponding to the class of nouns represented by the word-forms katodami (by cathodes) and vlastnostmi properties) (both are assigned the same morphemic information, though the word-forms in question belong to etymologically quite different types of inflection of (feminine) nouns (cf. the difference between the word-inflection endings, ami and mi, respectively). B. Lemmatization information. Lemmatization, i.e. convering an inflected word-form into the normal form (i.e. 1 sg with nouns, 1 sg masculine with adjectives and pronouns, and the infinitive form with verbs) has a specific purpose, being connected with those applications of morphemic analysis which concern the terminological elements of technical texts (such as automatic indexing). In the present system, lemmatization is carried out by a retrograde erasing of a certain number of symbols (possibly zero) and by adding a number of specific symbols (possibly zero) to what has been left after the erasing; in lemmatization (unlike in the rest of the algorithm) we work with diacritic marks as specific symbols. In this way, lemmatization can be accounted for by means of several tens of simple and highly general rules, cutting across the inflectional endings and also across the inflectional types of different part-of-speech categories. It should be pointed out that lemmatization concerns rather the concrete words (word-forms) found in a text than the word-ends themselves: though the majority of the lemmatization rules operate on word-ends (concerning usually only a part a word-end, which is close to a word- 181 -ending, cf. the symbol in the word-end tody,corresponding to the word-form in exceptional cases, for e 1 xamp e where the stem of a word is affected by an alternation, the erasing may reach to the left of the concrete word, i.e. behind the word-end; cf. the word-end ste (consisting of three symbols), which, with some simplifications, unambiEuously indicates a verb (K), but which is not sufficient for the lemmatization of such verb-forms as roste (grows) to their infinitives crow)), where four rightmost of the concrete word should be considered. The rules of leamatization have generally the form EX; abc...], where X stands for the number of the symbols to be erased, and abc..., for the specific symbols to be added. In the algorithm, the rules are usually referred to by numbers, and listed in an appendix. Thus, for Rule 2 (El; a]) converts F 2 sg 1 4 pl) into katoda F 1 sg) by erasing one (namely ;,:,) and by adding one symbol (namely a). (;, stands for the relation of ambiguity). :very lemmatization rule has at least one aPplication to various tyres of mor-hemic categories concerning not only different distinctions within a single part-of-speech category (typically, different genders with nouns) but also different part-of-speech categories (for example, a single lemmatization rule can be applied to nouns, adjectives, and verls;: this means that a lemmatization rule may concern, in any of the part-ofspeech categories in question, more than an.. word-ending (e.g. of different gender), and these word-endings may be in tarn ambiguoue between various case-and-number aeeigne.ents. can be illustrated by Rule 6 and aule 3. ault. 6 (El; erase one eyml:ol, add nothing) cuts across nouns, adjectivez, and verbs, converting e.g. (communicaticns) to spoj(communio-tion,; (ly to :,oung to (young), and (sucked &apos;Lick Rule d (P; erase two symbols, add nothing) &apos;plications (to all genders of nouns and to ad,jectivoa) and corresponds, on the whole, to 16 word-endings, out of which two arc two-ways ambiguous as concerns caee and number. The 16 word- -eudin,s are illustrated by the word- -ore in Figure 2 (where obvod . cirodbornik= expert, vlastnost = relace building, M1a777; and puvodni,. original). Figure 2. Lemmatization. obvod,&apos;*e (6 sg); obvodem(7 sg); 7777TN(2 pl) odbornikem(7 se); odborn2:kA(2 pl) katodam, vlastnostem(3 TA.); relacemi stays:zilch(6 stavanimi(7 pl) mlaqch,pAvodnich (2 6 pl); 7731717(7 1,1) In the above survey, the words which are assigned common information (e.g. vlastnostmi, to etymolegically different types of inflection, which, however, need nct be distinguished here: thour:h the lemmatization rules can be arranged in a scale according to their complexity or range cf application, the present method of lemmatization covers both simrle (recalar) and complicated (irregular) types of word-inflection and word-formation in an equally economic manner. C. Semantic information. The semantic analysis by means of the retrograde morphemic analysis is a yet unfinished, but presumably smoothly feasible task, which will be based on the account of productive word-endings by means of word-ends. The considerations concerning the semantic analysis should start from establishing a set of semantic categories of nouns and also adjectives which are considered to be relevant for the analysis of technical texts. In addition to the cgnsiderTticn productive word-endings, can also introduced into the algorithm such word-ends which account for semantically relevant but only restrictedly productive word-formation endins (such (meter)), if such word-ends have been &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; in the complementary word-ends the (for example, it may happen that a productive word-endinr: coinciding with a single word-end (such as tko, cf. below) is &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; in this In establishing the set of semantic categories, we can draw from (Turiiiova, 1980) and (Kirschner, 1983), prorosing that there should be introduced for example the category of Instrument (Tool) (as expressed by the productive worddie, tko, a6, or, and by the resTFrct7Ily productive word-endin:s metr, =f, fon, and skop), Ana, eni, AE and z377 frorerty (est, ita and ance), etc. The information concerning semantic 182 analysis can be rendered by indicating pieces of information as semantically relevant (with respect to the classification of semantic categories), but presumably it will be even possible to state this kind of information essentially only in an appendix to the algorithm. Such an appendix should consist of the specification that every word-end (this concerns also complementary word-ends) whose rightmost symbols coincide with the word-ending in question (because a word-end is usually longer than, or identical to, the wordending which is accounted for by it) and which is assigned certain morphemic information (concerning usually gender) corresponds to the semantic category in question; of. all word-ends whose three symbols are aci and which the output F 7 2 pl (such as lad, which is &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; in the complementary word-ends) correspond to the semantic category of nouns of action (in this case, aci is correlated to the normal form with ace, which is the Czech equivalent of the English ation). Possible exceptions to the semantic information concerning the word-ends which account for the word-endings in question should be indicated directly in the algorithm (e.g. by superscripts in the output information); for example, the above- -reentioned nominal word-ending aci (which systematically clashes with theectival aci S 1, 4 sg t sg F 2, N F S 1, 4 pl, and thus is accounted for by about 30 pieces of output information) has about five semantic exceptions to it (such as nadaci (nadace . grant, support nor of for which there should be established word-ends in the algorithm, with the indication, in the output information, their exceptionality (with to the other word-ends whose symbols are mei and which ore .:.ssiEned the output in=ation in auastion), i.e. of their non-membership in the class of nouns of action. 4. AV:DIGNITY This section brings information (i) cases of distincluded in the algorithm; (ii) genuine irresolvable cases, and (iii) cases of morphemically irresolvable ambiguity. (i) Cases of morphemic distinctions not included in the algorithm. We prefer not to include in the algorithm of ;analysis (with possible exceptions) morphemic distinctions concerning these word- -inflection endings which occur in technical texts only rarel: or not at all, particularly the following distinctions: (a) Verbs: 1 sg indicative present (I suprose)); 2 present (such as (you suppose)); 2 sg imperative such as vyber(choose)); transgressive forms as (supposing)) and 1 and 2 pl imperative are assigned only the morphemic but not the lemmatization information because these forms are supposed not to be semantically relevant. Nouns: and pl (such as odborniku! (expert!)). (c) Adjectives: masculine-animate pl as (tall)). (ii) Genuine irresolvable cases. By the present kind of anal:isis, there practically cannot be resolved, in spite of their regular inflection, geographical and personal proper names, their multitude preventing the linguist from empirically establishing their (unambiguous or ambiguous) word-ends. This can be partly overcome by introducing into the analysis the recognition of capital letters and/or by establishing a &amp;quot;right set&amp;quot; of proper names to be analyzed (which seems to be an easier task with names, of. (Eurol)e), (Prague) etc.). solution, accusative form of nraha (F), namely Prahu, would yield a case of morphemically i7Fesolvable ambiguity with the locative form of 21Â±.11 (N; threshold), prahu.Also ceYtain frequent personal names can be treated in this way dioda(the diode of Schottky)). (iii) Cases of morphemically irresolvable ambiguity. The cases of this kind of ambiguity concern all of the morphemic categories as well as lemmatization, occurring singly or as combined in various ways. In what follows, the relownt Of ambiEuity are indicated by and the other cases of ambiguity are inducated by commas or semicolons. Ambiguity concerning only -speech category; cf. the ambiguity of word-ends corresponding to non- -inflected words, such as the ambiguity the word-end tP between adverb :reposition (D C), t&apos;f&apos; standing for several words including c..7. vevnitr. or zevnitf.(from (b) Ambiguity concernin,: part-of-ei.eech category in combination with other kinds cf. the of the word-ends corresponding to inflected words, such as the ambiguity of the word- /rastbetween noun and verb (N 4 sg ; growth &apos; to or ambiflity of the word-end adjective and verb (A 1, pl , T1: direct straightens). 183 (c) Ambiguity concerning only gender, cf. the ambiguity in gender concerning word-inflection endings with adjectives, such as the ambiguity of the word-ends (coinciding, with one exception, with word-inflection endings) ish (2, 6 D1) and pl), which are ambiguous among all genders (N s t F S). (d) Ambiguity concerning gender in combination with other kinds of ambiguity: (aa) Ambiguity concerning gender in combination with case and number, of. the /set,which is ambiguous between and neuter noun 4 sg 5 2 pl: set f, of hundreds). (bb) Surface-syntax ambiguity concerning gender in combination with underlying ambiguity concerning case and number, cf. word-end Zradky(lines), which is ambiguous between masculine-inanimate and noun (N 1, 4, F 2 sg; 1, ambiguity in gender, however, is not present on the underlying level of Czech, where only a single lexical item (masculine-inanimate noun) is hypothesized to occur, as corresponding to the two surface normal forms (i.e. masculine-inanimate and feminine), the two surface genders accidentally yielding ambiguity in the word-end (word-form) Ifadky, (cc) Ambiguity concerning gender in combination with animateness (and case), the word-end /61en(member), which is ambiguous between masculine-inanimate and masculine-animate noun (N 1, 4 sg t 1 sg). (In the majority of the other cases of the inflection of masculine nouns, the ambiguity in animateness is not accompanied by the case ambiguity.) (e) Ambiguity concerning only case (and number), not accompanied by any other of ambiguity, cf. the word-end tody (F 2 sg S 1 ;, 4 pl). (f) Systematic ambiguity concerning the distinction between geographical names and possessive adjectives derived from lexically corresponding personal names, the word-end /Bene5ova(N sg A N 2 sg; F 1 sg; 5 1, 4 pl: of Bene&apos;gov of Bene E s). (E) Ambiguity concerning lemmatization, the word-end yvAil(K), corresponding a single word-form vyvAH,between lemmatization rules (1; t) and [2; et], to the infinitives balance) and vyvAlet(to export), respectively. Cf. also the surface-syntax ambiguity in lemmatization with the /T:Adky(cf. (bb) above), which is surface-syntax ambiguous in gender (N: fAdek F: fadka). The present treatment of ambiguity is characteristic of the procedural conception of morphemics in that the method of accounting for every etymological word-ending by means of at least one word-end (piece of output information) removes from the analysis the systematic ambiguity as well as morphemic irregularities (exceptions) concerning etymological word-inflection and word-formation endings, which have been usually treated by means of various restrictions and other ad-hoc means. :very case of the systematic etymological ambiguity is accountable for by several tens or even hundreds of pieces of output information (cf. the systematic ambiguity of the word-formation ending aci as mentioned in that of masculine-inanimate, masculine-animate and feminine nouns with additional morphemically irresolvable ambiguity concerning case and number: 4 Â§ t 4, 7 pl Â§ F 2 sg; 1, 4 pl); on the other hand, exceptions to word-endings (in the form of word-ends with different output information) are accountable for by several pieces of output information (cf. the word-inflection ending as mentioned in section 2, which is accountable for by three pieces of output information, representing one exception, or the word-formation ending as mentioned in section is accountable for by five pieces of output information, representing six exceptions). resolving the cases of the systeambiguity and of irregularity, it is possible to list the remaining (about one hundred) cases of morphemically irresolvable ambiguity (with the exception of the case-number ambiguity accompanying gender ambiguity); such a list can be compared to the list (PanevovA, 1981) word-f&apos;..srms in Czech. FanevovA s list, not being lexically restricted with respect to specific applications, includes also proper names, words not occurring in technical texts and forms not by the present algorithm as singular imperative with verbs), but on the other hand, it consists only of full word-forms, thus intersecting with the present list, where first of all ambiguous word-ends in the form of parts of words are involved. 5. QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS The present conception of the algorithm of morphemic analysis is based on the absolute frequency of word-ends in technical texts. In the ideal case, the word- -ends should be arranged with respect to the frequency of their last (rightmost), last-but-one, etc., symbols a task which itself would require the aid of a computer; for the time being, we must 184 work with an approximation, which makes it necessary to divide the algorithm into two parts according to the assumption that the first two hundred word-ends on the scale of absolute frequency, arranged according to a statistical examination concerning the whole word-ends, could resolve about fifty percent of the words of a technical text, while the other word-ends of the algorithm (pieces of output information), arranged according to the frequency of their last symbols, resolve the remainingportion of a technical text. We assume that out of the about twenty thousand . pieces of output information of the broadly conceived nreliminary version of the algorithm, only several thousands will be sufficient to cover the words which may occur in a standard technical text (this will lead to a substantial reduction of the preliminary version of the algorithm). The words included into the analysis fall into four major semantic hyper- -categories (not used in the semantic analysis); (i) words with the most general semantics (including the forms of categorial verbs, Such as1221 (to be), such as v etc.); (ii) general terms typical of technical (such as metoda (method), words specific to the given technical domain, e.g. microelectronics (such as katoda (cathode), obvod (circuit), etc.), and (iv) words 7777a1 of other (possibly affiliated) domains (such as cihla strecha(roof), conception the most hundred (which in a special algorithm) can be illustrated by a list involving ten most frequent word-ends; in Czech technical texts, they belong to the first hy72erword-ends are of throe &apos;minds; (i) word-ends in the form of parts of word-forms (which maL accidentally etymological word-endings, as 1cl 6ho); (ii) word-ends the form of Tirl (such os or and (iii) word-ends in of parts of resolvable minor (such as 0 or such word-ends are indicated In addition to this, there can be distinguished morphemically unambiguous word-ends (cf. Laa, morphemically ambiouxms word- L4e, ). In the list in FiEure j, all cases ,. ambiguity (including the ambiguity in case and nunber) are indicated by :I; La, for the sake of clarity, morphemic information is given directly by means of English equivalents. word-ends. -- A t S 2 E -- (reflexive) C (with) o -is (4 it s7&apos; C 1 2 6 sE :&amp;quot;&amp;quot; 1 2 4 n1 5.

CONCLUCICN have a not yet but promising system of a right-to-left morphemic analysis intended for technical texts in Czech and based on a conception of morphemically unambignous or irresolvably ambiguous word-ends as embodying the cases of morphemic ambiguity in an inflectional language. The present system seems to be more economic than the previous systems (which are fully or partly based on the conception of etymological word-endings (and word-stems) or on the conception of word-ends as consisting of a fixed, apriori established of symbols) in that it dispense with any dictionary as well as with the notion of morphemic irregularity; moreover, it is capable of an interaction with the other levels of analysis, as well as of various adjustments. The advantages of the present system vis-a-vis the previous systems can be summarized as follows. (i) Due to the fact that every set of complementary word-ends (with respect to the Liven horizontal word-end(s)) is assigned a common piece of output inforand also to fact that even single word-end often corresoonds words (lexical an(Vcr several word-forms, the number of pieces of output information necessary for resolving a standard technical text is presumably considerably lower than the number of the word-forms of both inflected and uninflected words) occurring in such a text. The present system able to account for the word-forms of new (new1L coined) words with productive word- -endings automatically, without considering their stems. The account of productive word- -endings also enables to account for semantically relevant word-endings by indicating the semantically relevant pieces of output information. 185 REFErENCES 1.
