We present the dialogue module of the
speech-to-speech translation system VERB-
MOBIL. We follow the approach that the
solution to dialogue processing in a medi-
ating scenario can not depend on a single
constrained processing tool, but on a com-
bination of several simple, efficient, and ro-
bust components. We show how our solu-
tion to dialogue processing works when ap-
plied to real data, and give some examples
where our module contributes to the cor-
rect translation from German to English.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999775093023256">
The implemented research prototype of the speech-
to-speech translation system VERBMOBIL (Wahlster,
1993; Bub and Schwinn, 1996) consists of more than
40 modules for both speech and linguistic processing.
The central storage for dialogue information within
the overall system is the dialogue module that ex-
changes data with 15 of the other modules.
Basic notions within VERBMOBIL are turns and
utterances. A turn is defined as one contribution of
a dialogue participant. Each turn divides into utter-
ances that sometimes resemble clauses as defined in
a traditional grammar. However, since we deal ex-
clusively with spoken, unconstrained contributions,
utterances are sometimes just pieces of linguistic ma-
terial.
For the dialogue module, the most important di-
alogue related information extracted for each utter-
ance is the so called dialogue act (Jekat et al., 1995).
Some dialogue acts describe solely the illocutionary
force, while other more domain specific ones describe
additionally aspects of the propositional content of
an utterance.
Prior to the selection of the dialogue acts, we ana-
lyzed dialogues from VERBMOBIL&apos;S corpus of spoken
and transliterated scheduling dialogues. More than
500 of them have been annotated with dialogue re-
lated information and serve as the empirical founda-
tion of our work.
Throughout this paper we will refer to the exam-
ple dialogue partly shown in figure 1. The transla-
tions are as the deep processing line of VERBMOBIL
provides them. We also annotated the utterances
with the dialogue acts as determined by the semantic
evaluation module. &amp;quot; // &amp;quot; shows where utterance
boundaries were determined.
We start with a brief introduction to dialogue pro-
cessing in the VERBMOBIL setting. Section 3 intro-
duces the basic data structures followed by two sec-
tions describing some of the tasks which are carried
out within the dialogue module. Before the con-
cluding remarks in section 8, we discuss aspects of
robustness and compare our approach to other sys-
tems.

Processing in VERBMOBIL

<bodyText confidence="0.999668166666666">
In contrast to many other NL-systems, the VERB-
MOBIL system is mediating a dialogue between two
persons. No restrictions are put on the locutors, ex-
cept for the limitation to stick to the approx. 2500
words VERBMOBIL recognizes. Therefore, VERBMO-
BIL and especially its dialogue component has to fol-
low the dialogue in any direction. In addition, the
dialogue module is faced with incomplete and incor-
rect input, and sometimes even gaps.
When designing a component for such a scenario,
we have chosen not to use one big constrained pro-
cessing tool. Instead, we have selected a combina-
tion of several simple and efficient approaches, which
together form a robust and efficient processing plat-
form.
As an effect of the mediating scenario, our mod-
ule cannot serve as a &amp;quot;dialogue controller&amp;quot; like in
man-machine dialogues. The only exception is when

clarification dialogues are necessary between VERB-
MOBIL and a user.
Due to its role as information server in the overall
VERBMOBIL system, we started early in the project
to collect requirements from other components in
the system. The result can be divided into three
subtasks:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.735776">
• we allow for other components to store and re-
trieve context information.
• we draw inferences on the basis of our input.
• we predict what is going to happen next.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999835428571429">
Moreover, within VERBMOBIL there are different
processing tracks: parallel to the deep, linguistic
based processing, different shallow processing mod-
ules also enter information into, and retrieve it from,
the dialogue module. The data from these parallel
tracks must be consistently stored and made acces-
sible in a uniform manner.
Figure 2 shows a screen dump of the graphical
user interface of our component while processing the
example dialogue. In the upper left corner we see the
structures of the dialogue sequence memory, where
the middle right row represents turns, and the left
and right rows represent utterances as segmented
by different analysis components. The upper right
part shows the intentional structure built by the plan
recognizer. Our module contains two instances of a
finite state automaton. The one in the lower left
corner is used for performing clarification dialogues,
and the other for visualization purposes (see section
7). The thematic structure representing temporal
expressions is displayed in the lower right corner.

structure which mirrors the sequential order of turns
and utterances. A wide range of operation has been
defined on this structure. For each turn, we store

ances. For the utterances we store e.g. the dialogue
act, dialogue phase, and predictions. These data are
partly provided by other modules of VERBMOBIL or
computed within the dialogue module itself (see be-
low).
Figure 3 shows the dialogue sequence memory af-
ter the processing of turn B02. For the deep anal-
ysis side (to the right), the turn is segmented into
four utterances: Guten Tag // fil-au Klein // Wir
ssen noch einen Termin ausmachen // far die
Mitarbeiterbesprechung, for which the semantic eval-
uation component has assigned the dialogue acts
GREET, INTRODUCE_NAME, INIT_DATE, and SUG-
GEST_SUPPORT_DATE respectively. To the left we
see the results of one of the shallow analysis com-
ponents. It splits up the input into two utterances
Guten Tag Frau Klein // Wir miissen . . . die Mi-
tarbeiterbesprechung and assigns the dialogue acts
GREET and INIT_DATE.
The need for and use of this structure is high-
lighted by the following example. In the domain of
appointment scheduling the German phrase Geht es
bei Ihnen? is ambiguous: bei /hnen can either re-
fer to a location, in which case the translation is
Would it be okay at your place? or, to a certain
time. In the latter case the correct translation is Is
that possible for you?. A simple way of disambiguat-
ing this is to look at the preceding dialogue act(s).
In our example dialogue, turn A13, the utterance
ich wirde iihm vierzehn Uhr vorschlagen (I would
hmm fourteen o&apos;clock suggest) contains the proposal
of a time, which is characterized by the dialogue act
SUGGEST_SUPPORT_DATE. With this dialogue act in
the immediately preceding context the ambiguity is
resolved as referring to a time and the correct trans-
lation is determined.
In our domain, in addition to the dialogue act the
most important propositional information are the
dates as proposed, rejected, and finally accepted by
the users of VERBMOBIL. While it is the task of the
semantic evaluation module to extract time informa-
tion from the actual utterances, the dialogue module
integrates those information in its thematic mem-
ory. This includes resolving relative time expres-
sions, e.g. two weeks ago, into precise time descrip-
tions, like &amp;quot;23rd week of 1996&amp;quot;. The information
about the dates is split in a specialization hierarchy.
Each date to be negotiated serves as a root, while
the nodes represent the information about years,
months, weeks, days, days of week, period of day
and finally time. Each node contains also informa-
tion about the attitude of the dialogue participants
concerning this certain item: proposed, rejected, or
accepted by one of the participants.
Figure 4 shows parts of the thematic structure
after the processing of turn B10. The black boxes
stand for the date currently under consideration.
Thursday, 8., is the current date agreed upon. We
also see the previously proposed interval from 6.-9.
of the same month in the box above (FROM_TO (6,9) ).

Besides the mere storage of dialogue related data,
there are also inference mechanisms integrating the
data in representations of different aspects of the
dialogue. These data are again stored in the context
memories shown above and are accessed by the other
VERBMOBIL modules.

Plan Based Inferences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999558486486486">
Inspecting our corpus, we can distinguish three
phases in most of the dialogues. In the first, the
opening phase, the locutors greet each other and the
topic of the dialogue is introduced. The dialogue
then proceeds into the negotiation phase, where the
actual negotiation takes place. It concludes in the
closing phase where the negotiated topic is confirmed
and the locutors say goodbye. This phase informa-
tion contributes to the correct transfer of an utter-
ance. For example, the German utterance Guten
Tag is translated to &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; in the greeting phase,
and to &amp;quot;Good day&amp;quot; in the closing phase.
The task of determining the phase of the dialogue
has been given to the plan recognizer (Alexander-
sson, 1995). It builds a tree like structure which
we call the intentional structure. The current ver-
sion makes use of plan operators both hand coded
and automatically derived from the VERBMOBIL cor-
pus. The method used is transferred from the field of
grammar extraction (Stolcke, 1994). To contribute
to the robustness of the system, the processing of
the recognizer is divided into several processing lev-
els like the &amp;quot;turn level&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;domain dependent
level&amp;quot;. The concepts of turn levels and the automatic
acquisition of operators are described in (Alexander-
sson, 1996).
In figure 5 we see the structure after processing
turns B02 and A03. The leaves of the tree are the
dialogue acts. The root node of the left subtree for
B02 is a GREE (T) -INIT- ... operator which belongs
to the greeting phase, while the partly visible one to
the right belongs to the negotiation phase.
In the example used in this paper we are process-
ing a &amp;quot;well formed&amp;quot; dialogue, so the turn structure
can be linked into a structure spanning over the
whole dialogue. We also see in figure 3 how the
phase information has been written into the boxes

Thematic Inferences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959923076923">
In scheduling dialogues, referring expressions like
the German word na chste occur frequently. Depend-
ing on the thematic structure it can be translated as
next if the date referred to is immediately after the
speaking time, or following in the other cases. The
thematic structure is mainly used to resolve this type
of anaphoric expressions if requested by the semantic
evaluation or the transfer module. The information
about the relation between the date under consid-
eration and the speaking time can be immediately
computed from the thematic structure.
The thematic structure is also used to check
whether the time expressions are correctly recog-
nized. If some implausible dates are recognized, e.g.
April, 31., a clarification can be invoked. The sys-
tem proposes the speaker a more plausible date, and
waits for an acceptance or rejection of the proposal.
In the first case, the correct date will be translated,
in the latter, the user is asked to repeat the whole
turn.
Using the current state of the thematic structure
and the dialogue act in combination with the time
information of an utterance, multiple readings can
be inferred (Maier, 1996). For example, if both lo-
cutors propose different dates, an implicit rejection
of the former date can be assumed.

5 Predictions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999789153846154">
A different type of inference is used to generate pre-
dictions about what comes next. While the plan-
based component uses declarative knowledge, albeit
acquired automatically, dialogue act predictions are
based solely on the annotated VERBMOBIL corpus.
The computation uses the conditional frequencies of
dialogue act sequences to compute probabilities of
the most likely follow-up dialogue acts (Reithinger et
al., 1996), a method adapted from language model-
ing (Jelinek, 1990). As described above, the dialogue
sequence memory serves as the central repository for
this information.
The sequence memory in figure 3 shows in addi-

tion to the actual recognized dialogue act also the
predictions for the following utterance. In (Rei-
thinger et al., 1996) it is demonstrated that ex-
ploiting the speaker direction significantly enhances
the prediction reliability. Therefore, predictions are
computed for both speakers. The numbers after the
predicted dialogue acts show the prediction proba-
bilities times 1000.
As can be seen in the figure, the actually recog-
nized dialogue acts are, for this turn, among the two
most probable predicted acts. Overall, approx. 74%
of all recognized dialogue acts are within the first
three predicted ones.
Major consumers of the predictions are the seman-
tic evaluation module, and the shallow translation
module. The former module that uses mainly knowl-
edge based methods to determine the dialogue act of
an utterance exploits the predictions to narrow down
the number of possible acts to consider. The shallow
translation module integrates the predictions within
a Bayesian classifier to compute dialogue acts di-
rectly from the word string.

6 Robustness
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980066666667">
For the dialogue module there are two major points
of insecurity during operation. On the one hand,
the user&apos;s dialogue behaviour cannot be controlled.
On the other hand, the segmentation as computed
by the syntactic-semantic construction module, and
the dialogue acts as computed by the semantic evalu-
ation module, are very often not the ones a linguistic
analysis on the paper will produce. Our example di-
alogue is a very good example for the latter problem.
Since no module in VERBMOBIL must ever crash,
we had to apply various methods to get a high degree
of robustness. The most knowledge intensive module
is the plan recognizer. The robustness of this sub-
component is ensured by dividing the construction of
the intentional structure into several processing lev-
els. Additionally, at the turn level the operators are
learned from the annotated corpus. If the construc-
tion of parts of the structure fails, some functionality
has been developed to recover. An important ingre-
dience of the processing is the notion of repair — if
the plan construction is faced with something unex-
pected, it uses a set of specialized repair operators to
recover. If parts of the structure could not be built,
we can estimate on the basis of predictions what the
gap consisted of.
The statistical knowledge base for the prediction
algorithm is trained on the VERBMOBIL corpus that
in its major parts contains well-behaved dialogues.
Although prediction quality gets worse if a sequence
of dialogue acts has never been seen, the interpola-

tion approach to compute the predictions still deliv-
ers useful data.
As mentioned above, to contribute to the correct-
ness of the overall system we perform different kinds
of clarification dialogues with the user. In addi-
tion to the inconsistent dates, we also e.g. recognize
similar words in the input that will be most likely
exchanged by the speech recognizer. Examples are
the German words for thirteenth (dreizehnter) and
thirtieth (dreifligster). Within a uniform computer-
human interaction, we resolve these problems.

In the speech-to-speech translation system JANUS
(Lavie et al., 1996), two different approaches, a plan
based and an automaton based, to model dialogues
have been implemented. Currently, only one is used
at a time. For VERBMOBIL, (Alexandersson and Re-
ithinger, 1995) showed that the descriptive power
of the plan recognizer and the predictive power of
the statistical component makes the automaton ob-
solete.
The automatic acquisition of a dialogue model
from a corpus is reported in (Kita et al., 1996).
They extract a probabilistic automaton using an an-
notated corpus of up to 60 dialogues. The transitions
correspond to dialogue acts. This method captures
only local discourse structures, whereas the plan
based approach of VERBMOBIL also allows for the
description of global structures. Comparable struc-
tures are also defined in the dialogue processing of
TRAINS (Traum and Allen, 1992). However, they
are defined manually and have not been tested on
larger data sets.

8 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981923076923">
Dialogue processing in a speech-to-speech transla-
tion system like VERBMOBIL requires innovative and
robust methods. In this paper we presented differ-
ent aspects of the dialogue module while processing
one example dialog. The combination of knowledge
based and statistical methods resulted in a reliable
system. Using the VERBMOBIL corpus as empirical
basis for training and test purposes significantly im-
proved the functionality and robustness of our mod-
ule, and allowed for focusing our efforts on real prob-
lems. The system is fully integrated in the VERBMO-
BIL system and has been tested on several thousands
of utterances.
Nevertheless, processing in the real system cre-
ates still new challenges. One problem that has to
be tackled in the future is the segmentation of turns
into utterances. Currently, turns are very often split
up into too many and too small utterances. In the
future, we will have to focus on the problem of &amp;quot;glue-
ing&amp;quot; fragments together. When given back to the
transfer and generation modules, this will enhance
translation quality.
Future work includes also more training and the
ability to handle sparse data. Although we use one of
the largest annotated corpora available, for purposes
like training we still need more data.

The dialogue then proceeds into the negotiation phase, where the actual negotiation takes place. It concludes in the closing phase where the negotiated topic is confirmed and the locutors say goodbye. This phase information contributes to the correct transfer of an utterance. For example, the German utterance Guten Tag is translated to &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; in the greeting phase, and to &amp;quot;Good day&amp;quot; in the closing phase. The task of determining the phase of the dialogue has been given to the plan recognizer (Alexandersson, 1995). It builds a tree like structure which we call the intentional structure.

The central storage for dialogue information within the overall system is the dialogue module that exchanges data with 15 of the other modules. Basic notions within VERBMOBIL are turns and utterances. A turn is defined as one contribution of a dialogue participant. Each turn divides into utterances that sometimes resemble clauses as defined in a traditional grammar. However, since we deal exclusively with spoken, unconstrained contributions, utterances are sometimes just pieces of linguistic material. For the dialogue</context>

While the planbased component uses declarative knowledge, albeit acquired automatically, dialogue act predictions are based solely on the annotated VERBMOBIL corpus. The computation uses the conditional frequencies of dialogue act sequences to compute probabilities of the most likely follow-up dialogue acts (Reithinger et al., 1996), a method adapted from language modeling (Jelinek, 1990).

The thematic structure is also used to check whether the time expressions are correctly recognized. If some implausible dates are recognized, e.g. April, 31., a clarification can be invoked. The system proposes the speaker a more plausible date, and waits for an acceptance or rejection of the proposal. In the first case, the correct date will be translated, in the latter, the user is asked to repeat the whole turn. Using the current state of the thematic structure and the dialogue act in combination with the time information of an utterance, multiple readings can be inferred (Maier, 1996). For example, if both locutors propose different dates, an implicit rejection of the former date can be assumed. 5 Predictions A different type of inference is used to generate predictions about what comes next.
