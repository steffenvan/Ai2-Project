ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.9916935">
Standard Discourse Representation Theory
(DRT) was designed mainly to explain the
so-called donkey-sentences. The pronouns
playing such a prominent role in all these
sentences belong, however, exclusively to
one (particularly simple) type of pronoun.
We try to extend DRT in order to cover an
equally important type of pronoun, the
so-called &amp;quot;descriptional&amp;quot; pronoun.
Discourse referents are now used to carry
information on the intension of their
referents as well as on the extension.
This allows, at the same time, to suggest
accessibility rules for pronouns which are
more appropriate than those suggested by
traditional DRT. These new rules are based
on the genericness of the sentences
involved.

1. PRONOMINAL REFERENCE AS STARTING POINT
FOR DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875833333333">
One of the starting points for the
development of DRT in Kamp&apos;s original
paper (Kamp 1981) was the seemingly
erratic behaviour shown by indefinite noun
phrases under a traditional logical
analysis, and the equally erratic interac-
tions that seem to obtain between indefin-
ite noun phrases and inter-sentential and
intra-sentential pronominal references to
them. Of particular interest was the
behaviour of indefinite noun phrases in
the so-called donkey-sentences.

1.1 Definiteness and Indefiniteness in
Traditional Linguistic Theory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9801942">
The traditional, and intuitively quite
convincing, view has it that definite noun
phrases refer to an object that is already
familiar to the speaker (and possibly also
to the listener), whereas indefinite noun
phrases introduce new objects. This theory
looks convincing as long as we consider
explicit definites, as in
1) John owns a donkey. John beats the don-
key
where the donkey is introduced as existing
by the indefinite noun phrase and referred
to as familiar by the following definite
noun phrase. Personal pronouns are, under
the accepted interpretation, contracted
forms of definite noun phrases, and the
familiarity hypothesis often works reason-
ably well for them. too: In the following
paraphrase of 1:
2) John owns a donkey. He beats it
the definite pronoun refers to the donkey
which is familiar after it has been intro-
duced by an indefinite noun phrase, and
the definite pronoun is, in other words,
co-referential with the preceding indefin-
ite noun phrase. For this reason the
traditional interpretation of noun phrases
and pronouns is called &amp;quot;referential&amp;quot;.
But problems surface if we consider sen-
tences such as
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9171535">
3) John doesn&apos;t own a donkey
4) Every boy likes his mother
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863533333333">
Neither does the indefinite noun phrase in
3 assert that there is a donkey that John
owns, nor can we really say that the pro-
noun &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; in 4 refers to something fami-
liar. Indeed, we can hardly say that it
refers to anything at all: If we stick to
the traditional view of what reference is,
viz, a relationship between an expression
of language and a real object, then there
can be no reference at all in 4, since no
existence of any boys was ever asserted.
It was examples such as those that brought
the whole familiarity theory into
disrepute (cf. the short historical
outline given by Heim 1983).

1.2 Definiteness and Indefiniteness in
Logically Oriented Linguistics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928333333333">
One radical solution to the problem of
non-referring noun phrases was suggested
by Russell in his classical Theory of
Descriptions. In it. both definite and
indefinite articles are interpreted as
existential quantifiers (with the addi-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997089">

<bodyText confidence="0.999890736842105">
tional constraint of uniqueness in the
case of the definite article). Noun
phrases do not refer at all, they all
assert existence (with the exception of
&amp;quot;logically proper names&amp;quot;, whose existence
Russell could never prove). Example 3
would become &amp;quot;It is not the case that
there is a donkey and John owns it&amp;quot;. and 4
would become &amp;quot;For every boy there is
exactly one mother such that he loves
her&amp;quot;. Now the truth values for these sen-
tences come out right. This interpretation
is, accordingly, called the &amp;quot;quantifies-
tional theory of noun phrases&amp;quot;. Under this
analysis pronouns correspond to the vari-
ables bound by quantifiers in First Order
Predicate Calculus.
Until recently most linguists and logi-
cians saw no other solution to the prob-
lems exemplified by sentences 3 and 4 than
to adopt Russell&apos;s theory. But the quan-
tificational theory of noun phrases does
not seem to help in multi-sentence
discourses such as 1 and 2. Here the trad-
itional referential theory still seemed to
have much more explanatory power. But this
meant, unfortunately, that noun phrases,
inclusive pronouns, must be interpreted in
(at least) two fundamentally different
ways: In single sentences such as 3 and 4
as quantifiers and bound variables.
respectively, without any referring func-
tion, and in multi-sentence discourses
such as 1 and 2 as referring expressions.
But far worse, there are certain cases
where neither of these interpretations
seems possible. The best-known examples
are the so-called donkey-sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9645105">
5) If John owns a donkey he is happy
6) If John owns a donkey he beats it
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.870999818181818">
The most natural translation of 5 is
7) EXISTS X: (donkey(X) AND owns(john,X))
-&gt; happy(john)
where the indefinite article can be
represented as an existential quantifier,
and this is in keeping with our intuition:
A valid paraphrase of this sentence is &amp;quot;If
there is some donkey that John owns he is
happy&amp;quot;. Example 6, on the other hand,
must get, as the only intuitively convinc-
ing representation,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.763005">
8) ALL X: ((donkey(X) AND owns(john,X)) -&gt;
beats(john,X))
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999634966666667">
where the indefinite article has to be
translated as a universal quantifier (&amp;quot;For
any donkey that John owns it will be the
case that he beats it&amp;quot;). The only syntac-
tic difference between the two sentences
is the pronominal reference to the noun
phrase &amp;quot;a donkey&amp;quot;, made in 6 but missing
in 5. The manner in which an arbitrarily
(in principle) far removed pronoun in the
surface sentence can turn an existential
quantifier into a universal one has been
puzzling logicians and linguists for a
long time. The referential theory of noun
phrases does not help, either, in these
cases. We really are at a loss to explain
donkey sentences.
But there are yet more functions of noun
phrases, and in particular of pronouns.
which seem to resist any straightforward
logical or &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; interpretation:
The Bach-Peters sentences, where pronouns
point crosswise forward and backward (&amp;quot;The
pilot who shot at it hit the Mig that
chased him&amp;quot;), and the so-called E-type
pronouns, which point from outside into
quantified statements (&amp;quot;Few M.P.s came to
the party but they had a good time&amp;quot; (Evans
1980:338). One particular kind of the E-
type pronouns will be given a lot of
attention below.

1.3 Pronominal Reference in Discourse
Representation Theory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999640047619047">
Kamp&apos;s DRT and Heim&apos;s File Change Seman-
tics are two (very similar) attempts to
unify the familiarity/novelty theory and
the quantificational theory of noun
phrases and, as specialthe
cases,
referential theory and the bound-variable
theory of pronouns. Both authors took up
an idea of Karttunen&apos;s (e.g. Karttunen
1976). viz, that we have to distinguish
between &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; referents, i.e. real
objects in the world (or a model of it).
and special discourse referents, whose
existence in the discourse does not in
itself say anything about the existence of
any objects in the world (or the model).
Indefinite noun phrases and proper names
introduce (i.e. assert the existence of)
new discourse referents. These discourse
referents constitute the universe of
discourse. The remaining information con-
tained in the sentence defines the condi-
tions on the discourse referents. Now the
conflict between the two interpretations
of noun phrases can be resolved: We can
&amp;quot;refer&amp;quot; (by means of definite noun phrases
or definite pronouns) to discourse
referents (this is the reference-
familiarity component) but these entities
are not real world objects but something
functionally similar to the variables used
in quantified statements (this is the
quantification component). This solution
works for anaphoric links from inside a
sentence (such as 6) as well as for those
from outside (e.g. 2), i.e. we have a way
to treat both isolated sentences and
discourses.
Notationally, discourse referents and con-
ditions are arranged In Discourse
Representation Structures (DRSs). Follow-
ing Guenthner 1986. we list on the left

hand side of a DRS the members of the
universe of discourse, on the right hand
side the conditions on them. Proper names
are not used as individual constants: dif-
ferent individuals can have the same name,
and proper names are therefore translated
as normal predicates. Contrary to Kamp&apos;s
original notation, but in agreement with
the practice now generally adopted, we do
not record the whole analysis process of
each sentence in the DRS. The first sen-
tence of example 2 would create an initial

2. RESTRICTIONS ON PRONOMINAL REFERENCE
IN DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984012">
2.1 The Classical Examples
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971937666666667">
It is claimed in the literature on DRT
that the construction principles of DRSs
also explain certain restrictions on pro-
nominal reference. Prime examples are
discourses with quantified sentences such
as
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.895634">
14) Every man who owns a donkey beats it.
* It has a white patch on its forehead
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993133333333">
where the pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the second sen-
tence cannot be linked anaphorically to
the noun phrase in the first sentence,
although the &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the first sentence (a
donkey-sentence) can. The same thing holds
for conditional sentences and negations.
DRT in its present form models the acces-
sibility restrictions encountered in these
examples by embedding DRSs inside each
other, and by postulating appropriate
accessibility rules for anaphoric links
(see Pinkal (1986) for a good overview,
and extensions concerning definite noun
phrases). While the discourse referents of
proper names are &amp;quot;pushed up&amp;quot; to the prin-
cipal DRS, even when embedded, the others
are left &amp;quot;buried&amp;quot; inside the embedded
DRSs. Accessibility rules make sure that
anaphoric links cannot reach down into
embedded DRSs, and only &amp;quot;backwards&amp;quot; in
embedded DRSs. We want to show in this
paper that the examples normally used to
show accessibility restrictions. e.g. 14,
are unacceptable not for the reasons given
in DRT, but for entirely different rea-
sons. We will furthermore show that other
phenomena of anaphora cannot be explained
by DRT in its present form. We will then
suggest appropriate modifications to DRT
to compensate for these deficiencies.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998811">
2.2 Counterexamples
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996966428571429">
It is certainly true that discourse frag-
ments such as 14 are unacceptable, but not
because pronouns cannot anaphorically
Point into quantified (conditional,
negated) statements. The following coun-
terexamples show that they can, under cer-
tain circumstances:

The pronouns &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the second

discourse referents which should be inac-
cessible, according to DRT. The accessi-

traditional DIRT, are too restrictive.

3. THE FUNCTION OF DISCOURSE REFERENTS IN
TRADITIONAL DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION
THEORY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991956521739">
If we want to cover cases such as 15 and
16 we not only have to modify the accessi-
bility restriction rules but also modify
our idea of what discourse referents stand
for. We said that DRT tries to unify the
referential and the quantificational
interpretation of noun phrases. If we use
Horn Clause Logic (HCL) as the target
language for the interpretation of sen-
tences we get a particularly simple
correspondence. In an example such as 2
(&amp;quot;John owns a donkey. He beats it&amp;quot;) the
&amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the second sentence ultimately
refers to the same individual as the noun
phrase &amp;quot;a donkey&amp;quot;, and the discourse
referent introduced by &amp;quot;a donkey&amp;quot; stands
for the individual constant representing
this individual in HCL (in standard First
Order Predicate Calculus we would, of
course, have to use a variable). In sen-
tences such 14 &amp;quot;Every man who owns a don-
key beats it&amp;quot;, however, the pronoun plays
the role of an individual variable in HCL
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.987595">
150
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995834">
(and in standard First Order Predicate
Calculus). Discourse referents now turn
out to be an abstraction of the concept of
individual variable and individual con-
stant in HCL. In other words, a discourse
referent stands for an individual variable
if the sentence in which it occurs is gen-
eric, and for a constant if it is non-
generic&apos;. as the translation of examples
2 (first sentence) and 15 shows:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.506946428571429">
Cul,u2: john(u1), donkey(u1),
own(ul,u2)]

own(john,donkey1).

and
Cul, u2: man(u1), woman (u2)

<equation confidence="0.41474025">
loves(ul,u2) --&gt; respects(ul,u2)]
becomes
respects(M,W) man(M), woman (W)
loves(M,W).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99974825">
In addition, discourse referents have to
&amp;quot;drag along&amp;quot; all the conditional expres-
sions in which they occur in the DRS
(&amp;quot;loves(M.W)&amp;quot; etc.) from there to the
logical representation. This concept of
what discourse referents stand for has to
be modified if we want to cover cases such
as 15 and 16.

4. Types of Anaphoric Reference to Noun
Phrases
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.946642">
4.1 Denotational Anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998989096774193">
In both of the two types of pronominal
anaphora considered so far, reference and
bound variable anaphora, there is a
direct mapping from pronouns to discourse
referents, and another one from discourse
referent to individual constant or vari-
able in the logical representation. A con-
stant stands for a real object in the
world, and a variable will stand for one
at evaluation time: this object is the
denotation of the pronoun. For this reason
both types of anaphora considered so far
are usually called &amp;quot;denotational ana-
phora&amp;quot;. This name is unfortunate as it
blurs the main idea behind this type of
anaphora, viz, the fact that &amp;quot;denotational
anaphora&amp;quot; is an abstraction of referential
(or: denotational) and non-referential
(or: bound variable) uses of pronouns and
other noun phrases. It would be much
better to speak of extensional anaphora
instead.
1. We treat truly generic sentences, such
as 15, and general sentences, such as
16, on a par. This is. of course, a
gross simplification. Furthermore, it
would be more precise to say, instead
of &amp;quot;variable&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;an expression contain-
ing variables&amp;quot; (to include Skolem-
Functions). In greater detail: cf.
Hess 1985.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.97192">
4.2 Descriptional Anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995666666667">
However, there is an important type of
anaphora that does not fall into this
category. 15 and 16 are two examples, but
we will first consider a few simpler
cases, namely anaphora with indefinite
pronouns, i.e. the pronoun &amp;quot;one(s)&amp;quot;.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.412789">
4.2.1 Indefinite Descriptional Anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998211">
In both of the following examples, vari-

the indefinite pronoun &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; does not have
the same denotation, or extension, as the
noun phrase it is anaphorically linked to.
We clearly speak about two different
papers (whether they be individually
known, as in 17, or taken generally, as in
18). In DRT in its present form, a single
discourse referent would be created for &amp;quot;a
paper&amp;quot;, and if we made the &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; point to
it we would get the wrong logical
interpretation (namely the one we would
legitimately get if the pronoun were
&amp;quot;it&amp;quot;).
We can get the correct interpretation if
we treat the indefinite pronoun as a
&amp;quot;macro&amp;quot;. i.e. as an abbreviation for part
of the preceding sentence. Before we
actually interpret the sentence, this
abbreviation must be &amp;quot;macro-expanded&amp;quot;
(Hirst&apos;s expression: Hirst 1981:31), i.e
replaced by a copy of the construction it
anaphorically points to. In the simple
examples above we can actually copy the
surface structure from the antecedent into
the place of the pronoun. This was the
explanation originally used in Transforma-
tional Grammar for all types of pronominal
reference, but it soon became clear that
this view was too simple. It is sufficient
to consider cases where the antecedent
contains indexical expressions such as
&amp;quot;my&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;I got my paper accepted by
&apos;Nature&apos;. Peter managed to get one
accepted by &apos;Science&amp;quot;. It is not syntac-
tic expressions which get copied but some
kind of &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot;, and the theory
that puts this view forward is accordingly
known as &amp;quot;identity-of-logical-form
theory&amp;quot;. or &amp;quot;ILFT&amp;quot; for short. In DRT, the
logical form we use are DRSs, and it will
consequently be discourse referents that
must be copied. During the analysis of a
sentence. a &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;-pronoun must first be
macro-expanded to an &amp;quot;empty shell&amp;quot; of the
discourse referent it anaphorically points
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993481">
151
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945153846154">
to, and the normal rules of translating
DRSs into logic must then be applied to
this expanded form of the sentence. If we
expand, for instance, the second sentence
of 17 we get a representation correspond-
ing to the discourse &amp;quot;John published a
paper in &apos;Nature&apos; in 1986. Peter published
a paper in &apos;Science&apos;&amp;quot;. The normal rules
for translating discourse referents would
now automatically create two different
logical representation constants for the
two discourse referents (&amp;quot;paperl&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;paper2&amp;quot;). Here the pronoun &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; does not
(necessarily) refer to the same denotation
as the noun phrase it anaphorically points
to but rather to a &amp;quot;description&amp;quot; of it.
This type of anaphora is therefore often
called &amp;quot;descriptional&amp;quot; anaphora.
There is, however, a problem to consider
that did not arise with denotational ana-
phora. If the sentence had been &amp;quot;John pub-
lished a paper in &apos;Nature&apos; in 1986. Peter
published one, too&amp;quot; we would have to
create a discourse referent corresponding
either to the sentence &amp;quot;Peter published a
paper in &apos;Nature&apos; in 1986, too&amp;quot;, or to
&amp;quot;... a paper in 1986. too&amp;quot; or. finally.
&amp;quot;... a paper in &apos;Nature&apos;, too&amp;quot;. The prob-
lem is, of course, to determine what
exactly a given pronoun should expand to.
This question will not be considered here.
The only thing we want to do is to show
that a very common type of anaphora.
descriptional anaphora, calls for an
extension of DRT which must make sure
that all the parts of a sentence that can
be used for expansion are represented as
individually accessible bits of informa-
tion in the DRS.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.623295">
4.2.2 Definite Descriptional Anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978828440476191">
The two examples we started with. 15 and
16. are acceptable because they, too, are
descriptional. But they are definite, as
they use both the definite pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;.
Furthermore, both of them are generic, and
so we consider this type of sentence
first.
Again, we have to expand pronouns into
newly created discourse referents, and
again we must determine what information
has to be packed into these new discourse
referents. But now it is a bit clearer
than with indefinite descriptional ana-
phora how this can be accomplished. Intui-
tively it is clear that in sentence 16,
for instance, the two instances of &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;
(plus one which was elliptically deleted:
&amp;quot;... and he will carry ...&amp;quot;) must be
expanded into three different discourse
referents, corresponding to &amp;quot;any hunter
who has spotted a deer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;any hunter who
has spotted and killed a deer&amp;quot;. and &amp;quot;any
hunter who has spotted, killed and cut up
a deer&amp;quot;, respectively. Why do we have to
use these successively more complicated
expressions? Because of the definiteness
of the pronoun.
The function of the definite pronoun, as
opposed to the indefinite one, becomes
clear if we compare example 16 with 18. In
18 we talked about different (at least.
potentially different) papers. In 16. how-
ever, we speak about one single hunter,
although in different stages of his deer-
killing activities. In other words, defin-
ite pronouns require uniqueness of their
ultimate referent in the same way that
definite noun phrases do. In the case of
denotational pronouns in non-generic sen-
tences the uniqueness of the constants,
used in HCL to encode existential quantif-
ication, itself enforces uniqueness of the
ultimate referents. But in the case of
descriptional anaphora in generic sen-
tences it is not trivial to enforce this
referential uniqueness. As each generic
sentence ultimately translates into an
independent rule in the logical represen-
tation we cannot establish uniqueness of a
referent named in different rules by sim-
ply using the same variable name. This
becomes quite obvious if we remember that
any implementation of a HCL prover, such
as Prolog, must create a new internal
representation for the same variable name.
when this name is used in different
clauses. We can nevertheless enforce
uniqueness of reference, even across gen-
eric sentences which map into separate
clauses, by adding the consequences of
each preceding clause to the conditions of
the following one:

Thus we not only see why examples 15 and

ate all four sentences into one discourse

5. AN EXTENSION OF DISCOURSE REPRESENTA-

If DRT is to cover descriptional anaphora
(both definite and indefinite, in generic
as well as in non-generic sentences) we
have to pack more information into
discourse referents than in standard DRT.
In addition, we will have to explain how
those types of anaphora that really are
impossible (such as 14) are blocked while
those that are possible are not. First we
want to design discourse referents which
contain all the information necessary for
the different types of pronominal ana-
phora, and then we will sketch some acces-
sibility restrictions on this background.

5.1 The Functions of Discourse Referents
in Revised Discourse Representation
Theory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999367182795699">
What kind of information must be avail-
able in a discourse referent to allow the
resolution of both denotational and
descriptional anaphora? Consider example
17 with indefinite descriptional anaphora.
We want a logical representation of this
discourse to look like2
event(c(1).publish).
agent(john.c(1)).
inst(c(2),papers).
object(c(2),c(1)).
location(&apos;Nature&apos;,c(2)).
event(c(3).publish).
agent(peter,c(3)).
1nst(c(4).paPers).
object(c(4).c(3)).
1ocation(&apos;Science&apos;,c(4)).
The discourse referent we introduce, for
instance, for the noun phrase &amp;quot;a paper&amp;quot;
must allow the system to later access the
constant which was created in the logical
representation to stand for this particu-
lar paper (&amp;quot;c(2)&amp;quot;), in the case we have to
resolve a denotational anaphora. But it
2. In the implementation we use constants
such as &amp;quot;c(1)&amp;quot; rather ,than &amp;quot;paperl&amp;quot;,
and expressions like &amp;quot;inst(_.papers)&amp;quot;
rather than &amp;quot;paper(_)&amp;quot;.
must also permit that, in the case of
descriptional anaphora, a copy of itself
is made to serve as new discourse
referent, used subsequently to create a
new entry in the logical representation
(e.g. &amp;quot;inst(c(4).papers)&amp;quot;). The discourse
referent should furthermore carry informa-
tion about the grammatical gender and
number of the underlying word, to further
facilitate pronoun resolution (e.g. &amp;quot;41.4-s&amp;quot;
for &amp;quot;male and singular&amp;quot;). A discourse
referent with sufficient information could
have a general structure like that:
&amp;quot;dr(U.V.X.I.G+N)&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;U&amp;quot; is the unique iden-
tifier of this discourse referent. &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; is
the discourse variable created for each
newly introduced discourse referent, which
will get bound to the extension as soon as
the entire sentence is translated into
HCL. This term, which is common to
discourse referents and Horn Clauses
created by them, is directly accessible
for denotational anaphora; it is, so to
speak, the link from the discourse level
into the logical representation. &amp;quot;G+N&amp;quot;
stand for gender and number. In &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; we
have to list those elements of a senten-
tial component which are minimally
required for denotational anaphora. It
turns out that these elements are all
those of the conditions on a discourse
referent that can be represented as unary
predicates (i.e. mainly nouns, adjectives,
and some intransitive verbs). They form.
together, the intension of the phenomenon
represented by the discourse referent.
This would suggest the term &amp;quot;intensional
anaphora&amp;quot; for what has been called &amp;quot;deno-
tational anaphora&amp;quot; so far. The &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;,
finally, tells us which variable in the
intension corresponds to the discourse
variable &amp;quot;V&amp;quot;. and thus the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;
together correspond to &amp;quot;lambda X.(I)&amp;quot;.
applicable to &amp;quot;V&amp;quot;. For the noun phrase
&amp;quot;a paper&amp;quot; this would give
&amp;quot;dr(3.V.X.(inst(X.papers)].n+s)&amp;quot;.
The DRS for the entire example 17 then
looks like that:
CCdr(1,john,S,[inst(S,humans)],m+s),
dr(2,nature,T,[inst(T,journals)],n+s),
dr(3,c(1),U,[inst(U,papers)],n+s),
dr(4,c(2),V,Cevent(V,publish),
agent(S,V),object(U,V),
place(T,V),time(1986,V)],n+s)]

agent(S,2),object(Y,2),
place(X,Z),time(198,6,2)3,n+s)7
: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,S
The last line gives the overall logical
structure of the entire DRS and states
here that all the conditions in the named
discourse referents have to be entered

conjunctively into the logical representa-
tion, as shown above. This overall logi-
cal structure is all that is left of the
&amp;quot;conditions&amp;quot;-part of traditional discourse
referents, and most information originally
encoded in this &amp;quot;conditions&amp;quot;-part has been
moved into the discourse referents. This
is closer to Heim&apos;s notation (for &amp;quot;file
cards&amp;quot;) than to Kamp&apos;s.
A generic sentence will be translated into
HCL rules, with variables. &amp;quot;If a hunter
spots a deer he will kill it&amp;quot; will become
event(c(1,(H,D,W)),kill):-
inst(H,hunters),
inst(D,deer),
event(W,spot),
agent(H,W), object(D,W).
agent(H,c(1,(H,D,W))) :-
inst(H,hunters),
inst(D,deer),
event(W,spot), agent(H,W),
object(D,W).
object(D,c(1,(H,D,W))) :-
inst(H,hunters),
inst(D,deer),
event(W,spot), agent(H,W),
object(D,W).
where the expression event &amp;quot;c(1,(H.D.W))&amp;quot;
is a Skolem function (more commonly writ-
ten as &amp;quot;skl(H,D,W)&amp;quot;). In order to get this
logical representation we will have to
generate discourse referents Such as
&amp;quot;dr(l.v(2).X.Iinst(X.hunters)]._.$)&amp;quot; for
&amp;quot;a hunter&amp;quot;, where the discourse variable
is bound to &amp;quot;v(2)&amp;quot;, the discourse level
representation of an object level variable
(&amp;quot;H&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;D&amp;quot;. etc.). The DRS for the entire
sentence will be
E[dr(1,v(1),R,Einst(R,hunters)],_+s),
dr(2,v(2).S.(inst(S,deer)].:14-8).
dr(3,v(3).T,(event(T.BP0t),
agent(R.T),obJect(S.T)].n+s).
dr(4,v(4),U,[event(U.kill).
object(v(2).v(4))].n+s)]
: 1.2,3 ---&gt; 4 ]
Again the last line outlines the logical
structure which is used to create the
entries in the logical representation.

5.2 Accessibility Restrictions in Revised
Discourse Representation Theory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986318507246377">
We noted above that classical DRT defines
accessibility restrictions which rule out
some perfectly legitimate examples, such
as 15. We think that the accessibility
restrictions that really hold, are the
result of interactions between the gener-
icness of the sentences involved, and the
genericness of a sentence is reflected
(among other things) in the type of
discourse referents it generates. Example
14 starts out with a generic statement and
suddenly switches over to a non-generic
statement whereas the acceptable examples
15 and 16 consist of two generic sen-
tences. It seems to be this switch of
genericness which makes the pronominal
reference impossible in example 14, and
not the fact that we point into a quanti-
fied sentence. But it is not necessary
that the sentences concerned belong to the
same genericness category. The first of
the following examples is unacceptable but
the second and third examples are accept-
able, despite mixed genericness:
23) * Whenever a farmer spots a donkey he
abuses it. He is beating and kicking It
right now.
24) Whenever Pedro spots a donkey he
abuses it. He is beating and kicking one
right now.
25) There is a farmer beating and kicking
a donkey. I&apos;ve seen him before. Whenever
he spots it he abuses it.
This asymmetry finds an explanation in the
fact that non-generic sentences, such as
the second sentence of example 23, (almost
always) speak about individuals. A pronoun
in such a sentence is therefore (in almost
all cases) a denotational pronoun, trying
to find an extensional value in an
antecedent which could be used as its own
denotation. Hence we will have to make
sure that a denotational pronoun accepts
only representations of individuals (of
the form &amp;quot;c(X)&amp;quot;) in the preceding
sentence(s), and that a failure to find
them must result in the entire discourse
becoming unacceptable. Thus the &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the second sentence of example 23
will try to find representations of indi-
viduals in the first sentence, but there
are only representations of &amp;quot;stereotypes&amp;quot;,
i.e. meta-level names for object level
variables (of the form &amp;quot;v(X)&amp;quot;). This makes
denotations&apos; anaphora impossible in this
case.
3. Basically the same idea was developed
by Bartsch 1979. though not in the
framework of DRT. She says that pro-
nouns such as those in 15 and 16 refer
to stereotypes of objects rather than
to the objects themselves. However,
we think she overstretches this idea
by claiming that ordinary donkey-
sentences must be explained by means
of stereotypes, also. There are,
after all, perfectly non-generic
donkey-sentences, such as &amp;quot;Every
farmer who bought a donkey slaughtered
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99915">
154
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984473684211">
The same problem does not arise in example
24. Here we have an explicitly deseriP-
tional pronoun (&amp;quot;one&amp;quot;), and it will not
care about the type of value that its
antecedent has (i.e. whether it is &amp;quot;c(X)&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;v(X)&amp;quot;), as it will only use the
antecedent&apos;s intension anyway.
Example 25. finally, is acceptable because
generic sentences can talk about either
individuals or &amp;quot;stereotypes&amp;quot;. Although the
third sentence (&amp;quot;Whenever he spots it he
abuses it.&amp;quot;) is generic, the pronouns in
it will first try to find denotations in
their antecedents. In this case, they will
succeed: The first sentence of 25 is non-
generic and has, of course, created
representations of individuals (i.e.
&amp;quot;c(X)&amp;quot;). If there had been no suitable
extensional antecedents, the pronouns
would have started looking for intensional
ones. This was the case in examples 15 and
16. In examples 19 to 22, finally, there
were actually extensional antecedent
values, but pragmatic considerations (i.e.
world knowledge) forces the hearer in
these cases to drop the (formally possi-
ble) denotational anaphora in favour of
(definite) descriptional anaphora. Just
finding intensional antecedents of
descriptional pronouns is, however, not
enough: You have then to decide how much
of the intension (often scattered over
several discourse referents) has to be
copied in the place of the pronoun. But
this is an other question altogether,
often involving inferences over world
knowledge, plausible reasoning etc.. which
cannot be dealt with here.

<abstract confidence="0.993703682034979">Standard Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) was designed mainly to explain the so-called donkey-sentences. The pronouns playing such a prominent role in all these sentences belong, however, exclusively to one (particularly simple) type of pronoun. We try to extend DRT in order to cover an equally important type of pronoun, the so-called &amp;quot;descriptional&amp;quot; pronoun. Discourse referents are now used to carry information on the intension of their referents as well as on the extension. This allows, at the same time, to suggest accessibility rules for pronouns which are more appropriate than those suggested by DRT. new rules are based the genericness of the involved. 1. PRONOMINAL REFERENCE AS STARTING POINT FOR DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY One of the starting points for the development of DRT in Kamp&apos;s original paper (Kamp 1981) was the seemingly erratic behaviour shown by indefinite noun phrases under a traditional logical analysis, and the equally erratic interactions that seem to obtain between indefinite noun phrases and inter-sentential and pronominal references them. Of particular interest was the of indefinite phrases in the so-called donkey-sentences. 1.1 Definiteness and Indefiniteness in Traditional Linguistic Theory and intuitively quite view has that definite noun phrases refer to an object that is already familiarto the speaker (and possibly also to the listener), whereas indefinite noun phrases introduce new objects. This theory looks convincing as long as we consider definites, as 1) John owns a donkey. John beats the donkey the donkey is introduced existing by the indefinite noun phrase and referred familiarby the following definite noun phrase. Personal pronouns are, under the accepted interpretation, contracted forms of definite noun phrases, and the familiarity hypothesis often works reasonfor them. too: In the following paraphrase of 1: 2) John owns a donkey. He beats it the definite pronoun refers to the donkey which is familiar after it has been introduced by an indefinite noun phrase, and the definite pronoun is, in other words, with the preceding indefinite noun phrase. For this reason the traditional interpretation of noun phrases and pronouns is called &amp;quot;referential&amp;quot;. But problems surface if we consider sentences such as 3) John doesn&apos;t own a donkey 4) Every boy likes his mother Neither does the indefinite noun phrase in 3 assert that there is a donkey that John owns, nor can we really say that the pronoun &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; in 4 refers to something familiar. Indeed, we can hardly say that it refers to anything at all: If we stick to the traditional view of what reference is, viz, a relationship between an expression languageand a real object, then there can be no reference at all in 4, since no existence of any boys was ever asserted. It was examples such as those that brought the whole familiarity theory into disrepute (cf. the short historical outline given by Heim 1983). 1.2 Definiteness and Indefiniteness in Logically Oriented Linguistics One radical solution to the problem of non-referring noun phrases was suggested by Russell in his classical Theory of Descriptions. In it. both definite and indefinite articles are interpreted as quantifiers (with the addi- 148 tional constraint of uniqueness in the case of the definite article). Noun phrases do not refer at all, they all assert existence (with the exception of &amp;quot;logically proper names&amp;quot;, whose existence Russell could never prove). Example 3 would become &amp;quot;It is not the case that isa donkey and John owns it&amp;quot;. and 4 become &amp;quot;For every boy is exactly one mother such that he loves her&amp;quot;. Now the truth values for these sentences come out right. This interpretation is, accordingly, called the &amp;quot;quantifiestional theory of noun phrases&amp;quot;. Under this analysis pronouns correspond to the variables bound by quantifiers in First Order Predicate Calculus. Until recently most linguists and logicians saw no other solution to the problems exemplified by sentences 3 and 4 than to adopt Russell&apos;s theory. But the quantificational theory of noun phrases does not seem to help in multi-sentence discourses such as 1 and 2. Here the traditional referential theory still seemed to have much more explanatory power. But this meant, unfortunately, that noun phrases, inclusive pronouns, must be interpreted in (at least) two fundamentally different ways: In single sentences such as 3 and 4 as quantifiers and bound variables. respectively, without any referring function, and in multi-sentence discourses such as 1 and 2 as referring expressions. But far worse, there are certain cases where neither of these interpretations seems possible. The best-known examples are the so-called donkey-sentences: 5) If John owns a donkey he is happy 6) If John owns a donkey he beats it The most natural translation of 5 is 7) EXISTS X: (donkey(X) AND owns(john,X)) -&gt; happy(john) where the indefinite article can be as an existentialquantifier, and this is in keeping with our intuition: A valid paraphrase of this sentence is &amp;quot;If there is some donkey that John owns he is happy&amp;quot;. Example 6, on the other hand, must get, as the only intuitively convincing representation, 8) ALL X: ((donkey(X) AND owns(john,X)) -&gt; beats(john,X)) where the indefinite article has to be as a universalquantifier (&amp;quot;For any donkey that John owns it will be the case that he beats it&amp;quot;). The only syntactic difference between the two sentences is the pronominal reference to the noun phrase &amp;quot;a donkey&amp;quot;, made in 6 but missing in 5. The manner in which an arbitrarily (in principle) far removed pronoun in the surface sentence can turn an existential quantifier into a universal one has been puzzling logicians and linguists for a long time. The referential theory of noun phrases does not help, either, in these cases. We really are at a loss to explain donkey sentences. But there are yet more functions of noun phrases, and in particular of pronouns. which seem to resist any straightforward logical or &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; interpretation: The Bach-Peters sentences, where pronouns point crosswise forward and backward (&amp;quot;The pilot who shot at it hit the Mig that chased him&amp;quot;), and the so-called E-type pronouns, which point from outside into quantified statements (&amp;quot;Few M.P.s came to party but theyhad a good time&amp;quot; (Evans 1980:338). One particular kind of the Etype pronouns will be given a lot of attention below. 1.3 Pronominal Reference in Discourse Representation Theory Kamp&apos;s DRT and Heim&apos;s File Change Semantics are two (very similar) attempts to unify the familiarity/novelty theory and the quantificational theory of noun phrases and, as specialthe cases, referential theory and the bound-variable theory of pronouns. Both authors took up an idea of Karttunen&apos;s (e.g. Karttunen 1976). viz, that we have to distinguish between &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; referents, i.e. real objects in the world (or a model of it). special referents,whose existence in the discourse does not in itself say anything about the existence of any objects in the world (or the model). Indefinitenoun phrases and proper names (i.e. assert the existenceof) referents.These discourse constitute the of discourse.The remaining information conin the sentence defines the conditions on the discourse referents. Now the conflict between the two interpretations of noun phrases can be resolved: We can &amp;quot;refer&amp;quot; (by means of definite noun phrases or definite pronouns) to discourse referents (this is the referencefamiliarity component) but these entities are not real world objects but something functionally similar to the variables used in quantified statements (this is the quantification component). This solution works for anaphoric links from inside a sentence (such as 6) as well as for those from outside (e.g. 2), i.e. we have a way to treat both isolated sentences and discourses. Notationally, discourse referents and conditions are arranged In Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs). Following Guenthner 1986. we list on the left 149 side of a members of the universe of discourse, on the right hand side the conditions on them. Proper names are not used as individual constants: different individuals can have the same name, and proper names are therefore translated as normal predicates. Contrary to Kamp&apos;s original notation, but in agreement with the practice now generally adopted, we do not record the whole analysis process of sentence in the first sentence of example 2 would create an initial DRS 9) Cul, u2: 1ohn(u1). donkey(u2), owns(ul.u2)) the second sentence would become 10) Cul, u2: john(u1), donkey(u2), owns(ul,u2), beats(ul.u2)] 6, on the other hand, would become 11) Cul: john(u1). Cu2: donkey(u2). owns(ul,u2)] --&gt; haPPY(u1)) 12) Cul: Cu2: john(u1), donkey(u2). owns(ul,u2)) --&gt; (beats(ul.u2))] Finally, a sentence such as &amp;quot;If a man loves a woman he will give her a ring&amp;quot; would be represented as 13) CCul,u2: man(u1), woman(u2). loves(ul.u2)) --&gt; Cu3: ring(u3). gives(ul,u3.u2)]] 2. RESTRICTIONS ON PRONOMINAL REFERENCE IN DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY 2.1 The Classical Examples is claimed in the literature on the construction principles of also explain certain restrictions on pronominal reference. Prime examples are discourses with quantified sentences such as 14) Every man who owns a donkey beats it. * It has a white patch on its forehead the pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the secondsentence cannot be linked anaphorically to the noun phrase in the first sentence, although the &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the first sentence (a donkey-sentence) can. The same thing holds sentencesand negations. its present form models the accessibility restrictions encountered in these by embeddingDRSs each other, and by postulating appropriate rulesfor anaphoric links (see Pinkal (1986) for a good overview, and extensions concerning definite noun phrases). While the discourse referents of proper names are &amp;quot;pushed up&amp;quot; to the prinwhen embedded, the others are left &amp;quot;buried&amp;quot; inside the embedded rules make sure that anaphoric links cannot reach down into only &amp;quot;backwards&amp;quot; in want to show in this paper that the examples normally used to show accessibility restrictions. e.g. 14, are unacceptable not for the reasons given for entirely different reasons. We will furthermore show that other phenomena of anaphora cannot be explained its present form. We will then appropriate modifications to to compensate for these deficiencies. 2.2 Counterexamples It is certainly true that discourse fragsuch as 14 unacceptable, but not because pronouns cannot anaphorically Point into quantified (conditional, negated) statements. The following counterexamples show that they can, under certain circumstances: 15) Every man who truly loves a woman respects her. He treats her as his equal and expects the same thing of her 16) Whenever a hunter spots a deer he will kill it. He will cut it up and carry it home The pronouns &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the second sentence of each example refer to discourse referents which should be inacaccording to accessirules for embedded used in too restrictive. 3. THE FUNCTION OF DISCOURSE REFERENTS IN TRADITIONAL DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY If we want to cover cases such as 15 and we only have to modify the accessibility restriction rules but also modify our idea of what discourse referents stand We said that to unify the referential and the quantificational interpretation of noun phrases. If we use Clause Logic(HCL) as the target language for the interpretation of sentences we get a particularly simple correspondence. In an example such as 2 (&amp;quot;John owns a donkey. He beats it&amp;quot;) the &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the second sentence ultimately refers to the same individual as the noun phrase &amp;quot;a donkey&amp;quot;, and the discourse referent introduced by &amp;quot;a donkey&amp;quot; stands the individual constantrepresenting this individual in HCL (in standard First Order Predicate Calculus we would, of course, have to use a variable). In sentences such 14 &amp;quot;Every man who owns a donkey beats it&amp;quot;, however, the pronoun plays role of an individual variablein HCL 150 (and in standard First Order Predicate Calculus). Discourse referents now turn to be an of the concept of individual variable and individual constantin HCL. In other words, a discourse stands for an individual the sentence in which it occurs is genand for a constantif it is nongeneric&apos;.as the translation of examples 2 (first sentence) and 15 shows: Cul,u2: john(u1), donkey(u1), own(ul,u2)] becomes own(john,donkey1). inst(donkeyl,donkeys). and Cul, u2: man(u1), woman (u2) loves(ul,u2) --&gt; respects(ul,u2)] becomes respects(M,W) man(M), woman (W) loves(M,W). In addition, discourse referents have to &amp;quot;drag along&amp;quot; all the conditional expressions in which they occur in the DRS (&amp;quot;loves(M.W)&amp;quot; etc.) from there to the logical representation. This concept of what discourse referents stand for has to be modified if we want to cover cases such as 15 and 16. 4. Types of Anaphoric Reference to Noun Phrases 4.1 Denotational Anaphora In both of the two types of pronominal anaphora considered so far, reference and bound variable anaphora, there is a direct mapping from pronouns to discourse referents, and another one from discourse referent to individual constant or variable in the logical representation. A constant stands for a real object in the world, and a variable will stand for one at evaluation time: this object is the denotationof the pronoun. For this reason both types of anaphora considered so far are usually called &amp;quot;denotational anaphora&amp;quot;. This name is unfortunate as it blurs the main idea behind this type of anaphora, viz, the fact that &amp;quot;denotational anaphora&amp;quot; is an abstraction of referential (or: denotational) and non-referential (or: bound variable) uses of pronouns and other noun phrases. It would be much to speak of extensionalanaphora instead. 1. We treat truly generic sentences, such 15, and generalsentences, such as 16, on a par. This is. of course, a gross simplification. Furthermore, it would be more precise to say, instead of &amp;quot;variable&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;an expression containing variables&amp;quot; (to include Skolem- Functions). In greater detail: cf. Hess 1985. 4.2 Descriptional Anaphora However, there is an important type of anaphora that does not fall into this category. 15 and 16 are two examples, but we will first consider a few simpler namely anaphora with pronouns, i.e. the pronoun &amp;quot;one(s)&amp;quot;. 4.2.1 Indefinite Descriptional Anaphora In both of the following examples, variants of the classical &amp;quot;paycheck-example&amp;quot;, the first one non-generic and the second one generic. 17) John published a paper in &apos;Nature&apos; in 1986. Peter published one in &apos;Science&apos; 18) A person who published a paper in &apos;Nature&apos; does not write one for the &apos;New Scientist&apos; the indefinite pronoun &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; does not have the same denotation, or extension, as the noun phrase it is anaphorically linked to. clearly speak about two papers (whether they be individually known, as in 17, or taken generally, as in 18). In DRT in its present form, a single discourse referent would be created for &amp;quot;a paper&amp;quot;, and if we made the &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; point to it we would get the wrong logical interpretation (namely the one we would legitimately get if the pronoun were &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;). We can get the correct interpretation if we treat the indefinite pronoun as a &amp;quot;macro&amp;quot;.i.e. as an abbreviationfor part of the preceding sentence. Before we actually interpret the sentence, this abbreviation must be &amp;quot;macro-expanded&amp;quot; (Hirst&apos;s expression: Hirst 1981:31), i.e by a copyof the construction it anaphorically points to. In the simple examples above we can actually copy the surfacestructure from the antecedent into the place of the pronoun. This was the explanation originally used in Transformational Grammar for all types of pronominal reference, but it soon became clear that this view was too simple. It is sufficient to consider cases where the antecedent contains indexical expressions such as &amp;quot;my&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;I got my paper accepted by &apos;Nature&apos;. Peter managed to get one accepted by &apos;Science&amp;quot;. It is not syntactic expressions which get copied but some kind of &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot;, and the theory that puts this view forward is accordingly &amp;quot;identity-of-logical-form theory&amp;quot;. or &amp;quot;ILFT&amp;quot; for short. In DRT, the logical form we use are DRSs, and it will consequently be discourse referents that must be copied. During the analysis of a sentence. a &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;-pronoun must first be macro-expanded to an &amp;quot;empty shell&amp;quot; of the discourse referent it anaphorically points 151 to, and the normal rules of translating DRSs into logic must then be applied to expandedform of the sentence. If we expand, for instance, the second sentence of 17 we get a representation corresponding to the discourse &amp;quot;John published a paper in &apos;Nature&apos; in 1986. Peter published paperin &apos;Science&apos;&amp;quot;. The normal rules for translating discourse referents would now automatically create two different logical representation constants for the two discourse referents (&amp;quot;paperl&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;paper2&amp;quot;). Here the pronoun &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; does not refer to the as the noun phrase it anaphorically points to but rather to a &amp;quot;description&amp;quot; of it. This type of anaphora is therefore often &amp;quot;descriptional&amp;quot;anaphora. There is, however, a problem to consider that did not arise with denotational anaphora. If the sentence had been &amp;quot;John published a paper in &apos;Nature&apos; in 1986. Peter published one, too&amp;quot; we would have to create a discourse referent corresponding eitherto the sentence &amp;quot;Peter published a paper in &apos;Nature&apos; in 1986, too&amp;quot;, or to &amp;quot;... a paper in 1986. too&amp;quot; or. finally. &amp;quot;... a paper in &apos;Nature&apos;, too&amp;quot;. The problem is, of course, to determine what exactly a given pronoun should expand to. This question will not be considered here. The only thing we want to do is to show that a very common type of anaphora. descriptional anaphora, calls for an extension of DRT which must make sure that all the parts of a sentence that can be used for expansion are represented as individually accessible bits of information in the DRS. 4.2.2 Definite Descriptional Anaphora The two examples we started with. 15 and 16. are acceptable because they, too, are descriptional. But they are definite, as they use both the definite pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;. both of them are generic,and so we consider this type of sentence first. Again, we have to expand pronouns into newly created discourse referents, and again we must determine what information has to be packed into these new discourse referents. But now it is a bit clearer than with indefinite descriptional anaphora how this can be accomplished. Intuitively it is clear that in sentence 16, for instance, the two instances of &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; (plus one which was elliptically deleted: &amp;quot;... and he will carry ...&amp;quot;) must be expanded into three different discourse referents, corresponding to &amp;quot;any hunter who has spotted a deer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;any hunter who has spotted and killed a deer&amp;quot;. and &amp;quot;any hunter who has spotted, killed and cut up a deer&amp;quot;, respectively. Why do we have to use these successively more complicated expressions? Because of the definiteness of the pronoun. The function of the definite pronoun, as opposed to the indefinite one, becomes clear if we compare example 16 with 18. In 18 we talked about different (at least. potentially different) papers. In 16. howwe speak about one singlehunter, although in different stages of his deerkilling activities. In other words, definite pronouns require uniqueness of their ultimate referent in the same way that definite noun phrases do. In the case of pronouns in non-genericsentences the uniqueness of the constants, used in HCL to encode existential quantification, itself enforces uniqueness of the ultimate referents. But in the case of anaphora in genericsentences it is not trivial to enforce this referential uniqueness. As each generic sentence ultimately translates into an independent rule in the logical representation we cannot establish uniqueness of a referent named in different rules by simply using the same variable name. This becomes quite obvious if we remember that any implementation of a HCL prover, such as Prolog, must create a new internal representation for the same variable name. when this name is used in different clauses. We can nevertheless enforce uniqueness of reference, even across generic sentences which map into separate clauses, by adding the consequences of each preceding clause to the conditions of the following one: kills(H.D) hunter(H), deer(D), spots(H,D). cuts_up(H,D) hunter(H), deer(D), spots(H.D). kills(H,D). carries_home(H,D):hunter(H), deer(D), spots(H.D). kills(H.D), cuts_up(H,D). Thus we not only see why examples 15 and 16 are possible but also how the pronouns have to be expanded. Definite descriptional anaphora can also with non-genericsentences. In 19) Here are the results of the analyses for samples 101 to 105. The result of the analysis for sample 101 for oxygen is negative. 20) It was positive last time 21) It is positive for nitrogen It is positive for sample the pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; clearly means &amp;quot;the result of the analysis for sample 101 for oxygen&amp;quot; &apos; in 20, but &amp;quot;the result of the analysis for 152 sample 101&amp;quot; in 21 and &amp;quot;the result of the for 22. If we concatenate all four sentences into one discourse we have to generate three different discourse referents for these noun phrases. As the sentence is non-generic they would give rise to three different constants in the logical representation to &amp;quot;result3&amp;quot;). That these senare the definite version of descriptional anaphora can also be seen from the fact that a valid paraphrase of is onefor nitrogen is positive&amp;quot;. 5. AN EXTENSION OF DISCOURSE REPRESENTA- TION THEORY If DRT is to cover descriptional anaphora (both definite and indefinite, in generic as well as in non-generic sentences) we have to pack more information into discourse referents than in standard DRT. In addition, we will have to explain how those types of anaphora that really are impossible (such as 14) are blocked while those that are possible are not. First we want to design discourse referents which contain all the information necessary for the different types of pronominal anaphora, and then we will sketch some accessibility restrictions on this background. 5.1 The Functions of Discourse Referents in Revised Discourse Representation Theory What kind of information must be available in a discourse referent to allow the resolution of both denotational and descriptional anaphora? Consider example 17 with indefinite descriptional anaphora. We want a logical representation of this to look event(c(1).publish).</abstract>
<note confidence="0.803807">agent(john.c(1)). inst(c(2),papers). object(c(2),c(1)). location(&apos;Nature&apos;,c(2)). event(c(3).publish). agent(peter,c(3)). 1nst(c(4).paPers). object(c(4).c(3)). 1ocation(&apos;Science&apos;,c(4)). The discourse referent we introduce, for</note>
<abstract confidence="0.991955293103448">the noun phrase &amp;quot;a paper&amp;quot; must allow the system to later access the constant which was created in the logical representation to stand for this particu- (&amp;quot;c(2)&amp;quot;), the case we have to a denotationalanaphora. But it the implementation we use constants as &amp;quot;c(1)&amp;quot; rather &amp;quot;paperl&amp;quot;, and expressions like &amp;quot;inst(_.papers)&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;paper(_)&amp;quot;. must also permit that, in the case of descriptional anaphora, a copy of itself made to serve discourse referent, used subsequently to create a entry in the logical The discourse referent should furthermore carry information about the grammatical gender and number of the underlying word, to further facilitate pronoun resolution (e.g. &amp;quot;41.4-s&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;male and singular&amp;quot;). A discourse referent with sufficient information could a general structure like &amp;quot;dr(U.V.X.I.G+N)&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;U&amp;quot; is the unique identifier of this discourse referent. &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; is the discourse variable created for each newly introduced discourse referent, which will get bound to the extension as soon as the entire sentence is translated into HCL. This term, which is common to discourse referents and Horn Clauses created by them, is directly accessible for denotational anaphora; it is, so to the link from the discourselevel the logicalrepresentation. &amp;quot;G+N&amp;quot; stand for gender and number. In &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; we have to list those elements of a sentential component which are minimally required for denotational anaphora. It turns out that these elements are all of the conditionson a discourse referent that can be represented as unary predicates (i.e. mainly nouns, adjectives, and some intransitive verbs). They form. the intensionof the phenomenon by discourse referent. This would suggest the term &amp;quot;intensional anaphora&amp;quot; for what has been called &amp;quot;denotational anaphora&amp;quot; so far. The &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;, finally, tells us which variable in the intension corresponds to the discourse variable &amp;quot;V&amp;quot;. and thus the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; correspond to X.(I)&amp;quot;. applicable to &amp;quot;V&amp;quot;. For the noun phrase paper&amp;quot; this &amp;quot;dr(3.V.X.(inst(X.papers)].n+s)&amp;quot;. The DRS for the entire example 17 then looks like that:</abstract>
<note confidence="0.821730153846154">CCdr(1,john,S,[inst(S,humans)],m+s), dr(2,nature,T,[inst(T,journals)],n+s), dr(3,c(1),U,[inst(U,papers)],n+s), dr(4,c(2),V,Cevent(V,publish), agent(S,V),object(U,V), place(T,V),time(1986,V)],n+s)] dr(5,peter,W,Einst(W,humans)),m+s), dr(6,science,X,[inst(X,journals)],n+s), dr(7,c(3),Y,[inst(Y,papers)],n+s), dr(S,c(4),Z,[event(Z,publish), agent(S,2),object(Y,2), place(X,Z),time(198,6,2)3,n+s)7 : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,S</note>
<abstract confidence="0.995537472392638">The last line gives the overall logical structure of the entire DRS and states that the conditions in named discourse referents have to be entered 153 conjunctively into the logical representation, as shown above. This overall logical structure is all that is left of the &amp;quot;conditions&amp;quot;-part of traditional discourse referents, and most information originally encoded in this &amp;quot;conditions&amp;quot;-part has been moved into the discourse referents. This is closer to Heim&apos;s notation (for &amp;quot;file cards&amp;quot;) than to Kamp&apos;s. A generic sentence will be translated into rules,with variables. &amp;quot;If a hunter spots a deer he will kill it&amp;quot; will become event(c(1,(H,D,W)),kill):inst(H,hunters), inst(D,deer), event(W,spot), agent(H,W), object(D,W). agent(H,c(1,(H,D,W))) :inst(H,hunters), inst(D,deer), event(W,spot), agent(H,W), object(D,W). object(D,c(1,(H,D,W))) :inst(H,hunters), inst(D,deer), event(W,spot), agent(H,W), object(D,W). where the expression event &amp;quot;c(1,(H.D.W))&amp;quot; is a Skolem function (more commonly written as &amp;quot;skl(H,D,W)&amp;quot;). In order to get this logical representation we will have to discourse referents as &amp;quot;dr(l.v(2).X.Iinst(X.hunters)]._.$)&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;a hunter&amp;quot;, where the discourse variable is bound to &amp;quot;v(2)&amp;quot;, the discourse level of an object level (&amp;quot;H&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;D&amp;quot;. etc.). The DRS for the entire sentence will be E[dr(1,v(1),R,Einst(R,hunters)],_+s), dr(2,v(2).S.(inst(S,deer)].:14-8). dr(3,v(3).T,(event(T.BP0t), agent(R.T),obJect(S.T)].n+s). dr(4,v(4),U,[event(U.kill). object(v(2).v(4))].n+s)] : 1.2,3 ---&gt; 4 ] Again the last line outlines the logical structure which is used to create the entries in the logical representation. 5.2 Accessibility Restrictions in Revised Discourse Representation Theory We noted above that classical DRT defines accessibility restrictions which rule out some perfectly legitimate examples, such as 15. We think that the accessibility restrictions that really hold, are the result of interactions between the genericness of the sentences involved, and the genericness of a sentence is reflected (among other things) in the type of discourse referents it generates. Example starts out with a statementand switches over to a statementwhereas the acceptable examples and 16 consist of two generic sentences. It seems to be this switch of genericness which makes the pronominal reference impossible in example 14, and not the fact that we point into a quantified sentence. But it is not necessary that the sentences concerned belong to the same genericness category. The first of the following examples is unacceptable but the second and third examples are acceptable, despite mixed genericness: 23) * Whenever a farmer spots a donkey he abuses it. He is beating and kicking It right now. 24) Whenever Pedro spots a donkey he abuses it. He is beating and kicking one right now. 25) There is a farmer beating and kicking a donkey. I&apos;ve seen him before. Whenever he spots it he abuses it. This asymmetry finds an explanation in the fact that non-generic sentences, such as the second sentence of example 23, (almost always) speak about individuals. A pronoun in such a sentence is therefore (in almost all cases) a denotational pronoun, trying extensional value in an antecedent which could be used as its own denotation. Hence we will have to make sure that a denotational pronoun accepts representations of individuals(of form the preceding sentence(s), and that a failure to find them must result in the entire discourse becoming unacceptable. Thus the &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the second sentence of example 23 will try to find representations of individuals in the first sentence, but there are only representations of &amp;quot;stereotypes&amp;quot;, i.e. meta-level names for object level variables (of the form &amp;quot;v(X)&amp;quot;). This makes denotations&apos; anaphora impossible in this case. the same idea was developed by Bartsch 1979. though not in the of DRT. She pronouns such as those in 15 and 16 refer stereotypesof objects rather than to the objects themselves. However, we think she overstretches this idea by claiming that ordinary donkeysentences must be explained by means of stereotypes, also. There are, after all, perfectly non-generic donkey-sentences, such as &amp;quot;Every farmer who bought a donkey slaughtered 154 The same problem does not arise in example Here we have an explicitly tional pronoun (&amp;quot;one&amp;quot;), and it will not care about the type of value that its antecedent has (i.e. whether it is &amp;quot;c(X)&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;v(X)&amp;quot;), as it will only use the intensionanyway. Example 25. finally, is acceptable because sentences can talk about individuals or &amp;quot;stereotypes&amp;quot;. Although the third sentence (&amp;quot;Whenever he spots it he abuses it.&amp;quot;) is generic, the pronouns in will first try to find denotationsin their antecedents. In this case, they will succeed: The first sentence of 25 is nongeneric and has, of course, created representations of individuals (i.e. &amp;quot;c(X)&amp;quot;). If there had been no suitable extensional antecedents, the pronouns would have started looking for intensional ones. This was the case in examples 15 and 16. In examples 19 to 22, finally, there were actually extensional antecedent values, but pragmatic considerations (i.e. world knowledge) forces the hearer in these cases to drop the (formally possible) denotational anaphora in favour of (definite) descriptional anaphora. Just findingintensional antecedents of descriptional pronouns is, however, not You have then to decide much of the intension (often scattered over several discourse referents) has to be copied in the place of the pronoun. But this is an other question altogether, often involving inferences over world knowledge, plausible reasoning etc.. which cannot be dealt with here.</abstract>

Indeed, we can hardly say that it refers to anything at all: If we stick to the traditional view of what reference is, viz, a relationship between an expression of language and a real object, then there can be no reference at all in 4, since no existence of any boys was ever asserted. It was examples such as those that brought the whole familiarity theory into disrepute (cf. the short historical outline given by Heim 1983). 1.2 Definiteness and Indefiniteness in Logically Oriented Linguistics One radical solution to the problem of non-referring noun phrases was suggested by Russell in his classical Theory of Descriptions. In it. both definite and indefinite articles are interpreted as existential quantifiers (with the addi148 tional constraint of uniqueness in the case of the definite article). Noun phrases do not refer at all, they all assert existence (with the exception of &amp;quot;logically proper names&amp;quot;, whose existence Russell could never prove). Example 3 would become &amp;quot;It is not the case that there is a donkey a</context>

It would be much better to speak of extensional anaphora instead. 1. We treat truly generic sentences, such as 15, and general sentences, such as 16, on a par. This is. of course, a gross simplification. Furthermore, it would be more precise to say, instead of &amp;quot;variable&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;an expression containing variables&amp;quot; (to include SkolemFunctions). In greater detail: cf. Hess 1985. 4.2 Descriptional Anaphora However, there is an important type of anaphora that does not fall into this category. 15 and 16 are two examples, but we will first consider a few simpler cases, namely anaphora with indefinite pronouns, i.e. the pronoun &amp;quot;one(s)&amp;quot;. 4.2.1 Indefinite Descriptional Anaphora In both of the following examples, variants of the classical &amp;quot;paycheck-example&amp;quot;, the first one non-generic and the second one generic. 17) John published a paper in &apos;Nature&apos; in 1986.

In DRT in its present form, a single discourse referent would be created for &amp;quot;a paper&amp;quot;, and if we made the &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; point to it we would get the wrong logical interpretation (namely the one we would legitimately get if the pronoun were &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;). We can get the correct interpretation if we treat the indefinite pronoun as a &amp;quot;macro&amp;quot;. i.e. as an abbreviation for part of the preceding sentence. Before we actually interpret the sentence, this abbreviation must be &amp;quot;macro-expanded&amp;quot; (Hirst&apos;s expression: Hirst 1981:31), i.e replaced by a copy of the construction it anaphorically points to. In the simple examples above we can actually copy the surface structure from the antecedent into the place of the pronoun. This was the explanation originally used in Transformational Grammar for all types of pronominal reference, but it soon became clear that this view was too simple. It is sufficient to consider cases where the antecedent contains indexical expressions such as &amp;quot;my&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;I got my paper accepted by &apos;Nature&apos;. Peter managed to get one accepted by &apos;Science&amp;quot;. It is not syntactic expressions which get c</context>

One particular kind of the Etype pronouns will be given a lot of attention below. 1.3 Pronominal Reference in Discourse Representation Theory Kamp&apos;s DRT and Heim&apos;s File Change Semantics are two (very similar) attempts to unify the familiarity/novelty theory and the quantificational theory of noun phrases and, as specialthe cases, referential theory and the bound-variable theory of pronouns. Both authors took up an idea of Karttunen&apos;s (e.g. Karttunen 1976). viz, that we have to distinguish between &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; referents, i.e. real objects in the world (or a model of it). and special discourse referents, whose existence in the discourse does not in itself say anything about the existence of any objects in the world (or the model). Indefinite noun phrases and proper names introduce (i.e. assert the existence of) new discourse referents. These discourse referents constitute the universe of discourse. The remaining information contained in the sentence defines the conditions on the discourse referents. Now the conflict between the two interpretations o</context>

Prime examples are discourses with quantified sentences such as 14) Every man who owns a donkey beats it. * It has a white patch on its forehead where the pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the second sentence cannot be linked anaphorically to the noun phrase in the first sentence, although the &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the first sentence (a donkey-sentence) can. The same thing holds for conditional sentences and negations. DRT in its present form models the accessibility restrictions encountered in these examples by embedding DRSs inside each other, and by postulating appropriate accessibility rules for anaphoric links (see Pinkal (1986) for a good overview, and extensions concerning definite noun phrases). While the discourse referents of proper names are &amp;quot;pushed up&amp;quot; to the principal DRS, even when embedded, the others are left &amp;quot;buried&amp;quot; inside the embedded DRSs. Accessibility rules make sure that anaphoric links cannot reach down into embedded DRSs, and only &amp;quot;backwards&amp;quot; in embedded DRSs. We want to show in this paper that the examples normally used to show accessibility restrictions. e.g. 14, are unacceptable not for the reasons given in DRT, but for entirely different reasons.
