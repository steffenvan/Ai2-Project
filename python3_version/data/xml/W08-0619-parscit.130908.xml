Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999976529411765">
Clinicians write the reports in natural lan-
guage which contains a large amount of in-
formal medical term. Automating conver-
sion of text into clinical terminologies al-
lows reliable retrieval and analysis of the
clinical notes. We have created an algor-
ithm that maps medical expressions in
clinical notes into a medical terminology.
This algorithm indexes medical terms into
an augmented lexicon. It performs lexical
searches in text and finds the longest pos-
sible matches in the target terminology,
SNOMED CT. The mapping system was
run on a collection of 470,000 clinical
notes from an Intensive Care Service (ICS).
The evaluation on a small part of the cor-
pus shows the precision is 70.4%.

<bodyText confidence="0.999986173913044">
A substantial amount of clinical data is locked
away in a non-standardised form of clinical lan-
guage which if standardised could be usefully
mined to gain greater understanding of patient care
and the progression of diseases. Clinical notes on a
patient&apos;s health are written in natural language
which contains a great deal of formal terminology
but used in an informal and unorderly manner.
These medical notes need to be converted to a
formal terminology to enable accurate retrieval and
to compile aggregated statistics of the medical care.
To satisfy these needs, we developed a medical
concept identifier that is able to identify concepts
in clinical notes and mapped to medical codes in a
terminology. The algorithm has been implemented
to tag medical concepts in a collection of 470,000
clinical notes from an Intensive Care Service. A
total of 9,135,000 instances of about 20,000 medi-
cal concepts were identified. These medical con-
cepts are used to study the medical language used
by Intensive Care clinical staff, and the identified
concepts are used to index patient clinical records
for targeted information retrieval activities.

There has been a large effort spent on automatic
recognition of medical and biomedical concepts
and mapping them to medical terminology. The
Unified Medical Language System Meta-thesaurus
(UMLS) is the world&apos;s largest medical knowledge
source and it has been the focus of much research.
One of the prominent systems to map free text to
UMLS are MetaMap (Aronson, 2001),

3 Constructing the Lexicon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999128">
The Augmented Lexicon is a data structure devel-
oped to keep track of the words that appear in the
concepts of the medical terminology. The Aug-
mented Lexicon is built from the individual words
in the gloss or the definition of the medical term.
For example, Myocardial Infarction has the atomic
words Myocardial and Infarction. Each concept is
normalised which includes removal of stop words,
stemming, and spelling variation generation. For
each word, a list of the concept ids that contain that
word is stored in the Augmented Lexicon. An ad-
ditional table is stored alongside the augmented
lexicon, called the “atomic term count” to record
the number of atomic terms that comprise each
description.

4 Token Matching Algorithm
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999332636363636">
The algorithm performs string alignment between
the source text and a target medical terminology.
The best matches are determined by scoring algor-
ithms for both perfect matching and partial match-
ing. To find all possible matches, the algorithm
iteratively performs matches for sub-strings using
dynamic programming, so that the algorithm
doesn’t have to generate all combination of sub-
strings for the input sentence. Each previously
computed substrings matches are stored and in a
matching matrix so don’t require recalculation.

The data stored in each cell is a list of medical
term ids that are in all the tokens that comprise the
cell. The score is then calculated using the &amp;quot;atomic
term count&amp;quot;, which stores the number of tokens
that make up that term. The score is the number of
tokens in the current cell that have the term id in
common divided by the number of tokens in the
full description.

The token matching algorithm has been imple-
mented as a module in a terminology server that
can provide real time text to medical concept en-
coding. The system was installed in the Intensive
Care Service that provides web interfaces for users
to submit clinical notes and it computed SNOMED
CT codes in real-time. The web interface has been
implemented in several clinical forms templates at
the RPAH, allowing data to be captured as the doc-
tors fill in these forms. A feedback form has been
implemented allowing clinicians to submit com-
ments, identify terms that are missed by the system
and submit corrections to incorrectly labeled terms.
This was seen as a rare opportunity to collect an
expert corrected corpus of clinical notes. Unfortu-
nately, there was little adherence to the correction
part of the program and so we do not yet have suf-
ficient material to be precise about recall values.
To evaluate the accuracy our systems, we col-
lected a set of bedside clinical notes of patient
monitoring chart information. 487 documents and
4,054 medical concepts were tagged with
SNOMED CT codes and have been evaluated by
medical experts. There are 2,852 correctly identi-
fied concepts and 1,202 incorrectly identified con-
cepts, results in a precision rate of 70.4%. The re-
call rate hasn’t been fully evaluated.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999908">
In conclusion, we have proposed a system to
find medical terms in free text clinical notes and
map them into a medical terminology. We have
implemented the algorithm as a web-service sys-
tem. The algorithm uses an augmented lexicon to
index concept descriptors in SNOMED CT, which
allow a much faster mapping of longest spanning
concepts in the system than a naïve word searching
approach, which can then create more effective
information retrieval and information extraction.
