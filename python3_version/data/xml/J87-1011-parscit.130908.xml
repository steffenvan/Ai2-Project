than monolingual, and these cases can be seen as monol-
ingual language processing augmented with elements of
machine translation. Even the lexicography chapter is
for a good deal concerned with monolingual aspects, but
what the authors do say about multilingual lexicons is to
the point. Their argument that the meta-text of a monol-
ingual dictionary is in another language, and that thus
every explanatory dictionary is multilingual, only contrib-
utes to a confusion of ideas. The meta-text is a special
style, but this text type is of course part of the same
language.
A more regrettable shortcoming is the fact that the
book is not multilingual in scope. The authors openly
admit that they have made efforts not to refer to litera-
ture which is not in English. An introductory book
should not narrow its readers&apos; horizon in this way. There
are already too many (computational) linguists, for whom
&amp;quot;natural language&amp;quot; is a synonym for &amp;quot;English&amp;quot;. It seems
preferable to emphasize that linguistics is not only the
science of language but also of languages. Computa-
tional linguistics is developing in that direction as well.

Speech synthesis has become, in the last ten years or so,
a field of substantial commercial as well as intellectual
interest. The Compleat Computational Linguist must
ultimately include speech synthesis (and recognition) in
his purview, just as theoretical linguistics must ultimately
explain the regularities in speech. The field has been
difficult to cover because important facets of it come
from such widely divergent disciplines as electrical engi-
neering and phonetics, and because there have been no
general and easy introductory text or reference books.
Electronic Synthesis of Speech goes a long way toward
easing this last difficulty.
Linggard intends this book to be &amp;quot;a comprehensive
text and reference source for scientists and technologists
working in the field&amp;quot; and also suggests that it should be
useful as a &amp;quot;textbook for courses on speech processing&amp;quot;
(p. vii). The first two chapters cover history and phonet-
ics, and the other four chapters treat mathematical and
computational aspects of synthesis.
I don&apos;t think this book would do as a sole reference or
course text book, although it would be very useful if
augmented with other sources. Because it attempts a
broad coverage of speech synthesis in a small volume, it
doesn&apos;t cover any single subject in depth. It would be
difficult to teach from this book because of its lack of
exercises and problems for the student. But overall, it&apos;s a
good book. The references are numerous and useful,
and it is especially satisfying to see synthesis set in its
historical context.
Linggard&apos;s coverage of the engineering aspects of
speech synthesis is excellent, although for a thorough
understanding you should consult the original technical
papers, which he references quite well. (A good
collection of these is in Flanagan and Rabiner (1973).)
Spot checking several of his numerous equations and
their derivations turned up no apparent errors. It is
refreshing to see the basic equations for speech
production derived from a true mechanical model rather
than from an electrical analog.
I would guess from this book that Linggard&apos;s home
discipline is engineering, because his coverage of phonet-
ics (Chapter 2), in contrast, is errorful and misleading.
Don&apos;t get your phonetics from this book; buy another, on
phonetics alone. (Ladefoged (1975) would be a good
selection, and Ruhlen (1976) has an excellent introducto-
ry chapter on phonetics.) Linggard can also be faulted
on his short discussion of the pre-historic evolution of
speech (pp. 2-3), which is speculative, superfluous, and
probably wrong.
It is often unclear if Linggard&apos;s comments on phonet-
ics are meant to apply just to English or to speech in
general. In addition, I think many of his details are
mistaken or misleading. Here is a sampler:
On page 23 is Fig. 2.4, Linggard&apos;s main presentation
of speech sounds. It is a table of IPA (International
Phonetic Association) symbols for sounds, illustrated
with example words. This table is quite misleading and
insufficient, especially for speakers of non-upper-class
British dialects. The legend to the figure reads &amp;quot;Some
suggested IPA symbols for the phonetic transcription of
English&amp;quot;; one must read the text carefully to discover
that they are really only symbols for RP (Received
Pronunciation) English, a minority upper-class British
variety of speech. He gives the word further as an exam-
ple of the sound /a/ (called &amp;quot;schwa&amp;quot;), and his symbols
for the diphthongs in peer, pair, boar, and boor use /a/
for the second part, or off-glide, of the vowel; the
student might think that /a/ sounds like r, but it doesn&apos;t.
RP has dropped some /r/s and changed others to h/.
The peculiarities of RP should have been discussed and
the table should have covered more general English.
There are also some discrepancies between vowel
symbols in his table and the table for RP presented in
Hughes and Trudgill (H&amp;T; 1979: 26):

More common usage of these symbols is in line with
H&amp;T, not Linggard: if you pronounced bet with the
sound most people transcribe with /e/, it would sound
like bait. This table is also incomplete, in that several
phonetic symbols used elsewhere in the book — such as
/o/ and /e/ further down on the same page — are not
defined. A table showing common variations in usage of
symbols for sounds, as in Ladefoged (1975: 64), would
have been a great help for the beginner.
On page 24, describing lip position and nasality, he
writes &amp;quot;Fortunately, these two variables do not seem to
be used as continuous variables to any great extent.&amp;quot;
True but misleading. The same thing could be said about
every other nonprosodic linguistic variable!
On page 25, he writes &amp;quot;[In English] the /w/ consists
of a rapid transition from a /u/ position to a /a/ posi-
tion.&amp;quot; Not exactly true. The /w/ consists of a rapid
transition from a position slightly more extreme than /u/
to whatever vowel follows.
On page 25, he writes &amp;quot;But in some languages and
dialects whispered or unvoiced versions of /w/, /j/, /r/,
and /1/ are valid articulatory gestures in their own right.&amp;quot;
True but misleading. Almost any voiced sound can be
found as a regular unvoiced variant in some language,
even vowels (cf. Japanese, Shoshone (Ruhlen 1976:
267)), and in English these sounds are regularly devoiced
when following an unvoiced stop in the same syllable.
On page 26: &amp;quot;The anomalous position of /h/ as a
fricative now becomes clear, since it is obvious that it is
impossible for it to have a voiced equivalent.&amp;quot; In fact,
/h/ is often phonetically voiced.
On page 28: &amp;quot;Pitch is the fundamental frequency of
vibration of the vocal cords.&amp;quot; This is not correct; pitch is
a perception typically corresponding to fundamental
frequency, but which may be influenced by other vari-
ables, such as loudness.
There is something wrong with the spectrogram on
page 33: at the location labeled /r/, the third formant
actually rises a little instead of falling, as it must if an /r/
is to be heard.
On page 37 he says: &amp;quot;For all stops the place of closure
is mainly characterised by the formant transitions into
and out of the stop.&amp;quot; This is a controversial position and
should be labeled as such. Some researchers think that
the noise at the instant of release is more important.
On page 15 he writes: &amp;quot;In general terms, two of these
[formants] are required to specify vowel quality, a third is
required to establish speaker identity, and the
fourth/fifth may be added to give natural voice quality.&amp;quot;
But on page 33: &amp;quot;For a given speaker three formants are
usually enough to characterise the vowel.&amp;quot; This is
confused and confusing. What&apos;s probably true is that
two formants are required for normal vowels, three for
vowels colored with /r/, as in hurt, and no one knows
how many are required for speaker identity and natural
voice quality.
If this review has seemed to concentrate too much on
phonetics, it&apos;s because that&apos;s where the problems lie.
In summary, this book gets a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; in prehistory,
&amp;quot;A&amp;quot; in history, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; in phonetics, and &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; in engineer-
ing. If you want to set up shop in computational phonet-
ics, get this one plus a good book on phonetics, and start
collecting papers from the journals.

To anyone working in artificial intelligence, this book
provides a comprehensive introduction to knowledge
representation (KR). By presenting original source papers
that have served to define the problems of KR, the book
provides a unique overview of the field. The overall
organization of the collection of papers includes
discussion of what constitutes a knowledge represen-
tation language; it presents problems introduced because
of the demand for automatic inferencing to provide
implicit information; and it addresses the issues of what
constitutes an adequate domain knowledge for a specific
application.
The book also includes an extensive partially anno-
tated bibliography of many related works that could not
be included in the volume. These annotations include
pointers to each mentioned article&apos;s applicability to KR in
general, in networks, in frames, regarding logic formal-
isms, whether they are procedural or production system
approaches, or whether they are specific to domain
knowledge representation.
The book has provided an excellent resource for my
Introduction to Natural Language Processing class. It
makes available many of the relevant papers that are crit-
ical to the current focus of research regarding meaning:
What is it? How to represent it? What are the constraints
introduced because of KR assumptions and their role
during implementation, and the general concerns of what
should be included in an implementation. Complementa-
ry as well as opposing viewpoints are found in close
proximity. Even the role of logic in KR, along with the

On page 26: &amp;quot;The anomalous position of /h/ as a fricative now becomes clear, since it is obvious that it is impossible for it to have a voiced equivalent.&amp;quot; In fact, /h/ is often phonetically voiced. On page 28: &amp;quot;Pitch is the fundamental frequency of vibration of the vocal cords.&amp;quot; This is not correct; pitch is a perception typically corresponding to fundamental frequency, but which may be influenced by other variables, such as loudness.
