The phonological rules discussed in this paper are part .of a system
which has been &apos;under development at M.I.T. to convert unrestricted text to
speech. The system utilizes a morph lexicon and a vocal tract model.
Although most of the linguistic analysis is done by decomposing words into
their constituent morphemes, such a system is not stAfficient for unrestricted
text. In order to attain the competence of a comprehensive system, it was
necessary to develop a scheme for dealing with unrecognizable words. This
is called the &amp;quot;letter-to-sound&amp;quot; system.
When a decomposition fails, that is, when a word, cannot be decomposed
into its cons_tituent morphs or when it is too infrequent in the English
language to be included in the morph lexicon, the &amp;quot;letter-to-sound&amp;quot; system
is invoked. The letter string which it receives is converted into a stressed
phoneme string using two sets of ordered phonological ruled. The first set
to be applied converts letters to phonemes, first stripping affilxes, then
converting consonants and finally converting vowels and affixes. The second
set applies An ordered set of rules which determine the atress contour of
the phoneme string.
These rules were developed., by a procesrs of extdnsive statistical analy-
sis of English words. The form of the rules reflects the fart that isronuncia-
tion of vowels and vowel digraphs, consonants and consonant c4usters, and
prefixes and suffixes is hrghly dependent upon context. The method of order-
ing rules allows converted strings which are highly dependable to be used as
context for those requiring a more complex framework. Detailed studies
of allowable suffix combinations and the effect of suffixati,on on stress
and vowel quality have also provided for more reliable resdlts.

<bodyText confidence="0.968456246268657">
A system to convert unreltricted printed text to speech has been under
development for several years at M.I.T.1&apos;2&apos;3 The approach has been to model
the proces.s employed by a native speaker of English when reading aloud. In
order to develop correct computational algorithms for the pronunciation of
English words, it has been necessary to reflect Che basic nature of linguis-
tic processes. Consequently, considerable emphasis has been placed on the
development of morphological and phon9logical analysis, stress patterns,
parsing systems and prosodic correlates.
It i4 possible, using the current system, to convert any English word
or string df words in a textual representation to intelligible speech. In
order to effect this conversion, a number of subsystems are utilized
including morphological analysis, letter-to-sound rules, stress rules and
phonemic speech synthesis. Prosodic studies are now in progress; experi-
mental parameteLs for fo contours and timing patterns will soon be included
in the system.
The letter., string which represents a word is usually converted to a
phoneme string in preparation for speech synthesis by a process of morpho-
logical analysis. A morph lexicon containing approximately 11,000 entries
has been developed and is used in conjunction with a morph decomposition
algorithm. Included in the lexicon are two major classes of morphs. One
class is composed of roots such as &amp;quot;trust&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;snow,&amp;quot; i.e.; words which car
occur alone, and bound roots such as -celve perceive, receive, conceive),
rot- (rotary, rotate, rotor) and -miss- (dismiss, missive, permissiveness).
Affixes make up the second class and may be attached either to roots or tc
bound morphemes. Accompanying each lexical entry is its phonemic representa-
tion, its morph class and its part(s) of speech.
Algorithmic decomposition of letter-strings models the prpcedure used
by a native speaker when confronted by a word which he does not immediately
recognize or has previously not encountered. If the word is not immediately
recognizable, i.e., if It is not in the &amp;quot;lexicon&amp;quot; of the native speaker in
its entirety, an attempt will be made to break it apart into its constituent
morphs. Such a process is probably used when vile reads a word siich as
antidisestablishmentarianism, earthrise&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cranapple- for the first time
The algorithm also models the ability to recognize mutations such As
the dropping of a final silent re-14 (observe - observance), the doubling of
t
a final consonant (red-reddest) and
preceding vocalic suffixes (glory -
also included, modeling the ability
plural (horses, cats, dogs) or past tense (quieted, hushed, whispered), and
to palatalize in appropriate contexts ( sculpt - sculpture, confuse - confu-
sion).
Another feature of the algorithm is a set of selectional rules which,
although very simple in form, choose Ole corpect morphomic analysis from all
possibilities in a large number of cases. A standard form for sequences of
morphemes is compared with each possibility, and rules describing preferred
composition are used in a pairwise comparison leading to an acceptable
result. The word &amp;quot;formally&amp;quot; provides an example in which the only rule
needed is one stating that a root followed by a suffix is preferable to two
concatenated roots. Possible decompositionsof the word &amp;quot;formally&amp;quot; are
the substitution of for final [y1
glorious). Morphophonemic rules are
to give a correct pronunciation for any
detected as follows(R represents &amp;quot;root&amp;quot; and S, &amp;quot;suffix&amp;quot;):
form (R) + al (S) + ly (S) form (R) + ally (R)
for, (R),-,- mall (R) + y (S) form (R) + all (R) + y (S)
It is clear that the correct decomposition is the only candidate having the
form of a single root followed by suffixes.
When a complete morphemic analysis fails, that is, when a word encoun-
tered by g native speaker cannot be separated into its constituent morphemes,
or when it is so infrequent in the English language that he has previously
not encountered it, a &amp;quot;letter-to-sound&amp;quot; system is invoked, i.e., an attempt
is made to sound out the word letter by letter. The competence of a native
speaker which allows him tQ perform this conversion is based on correspon-
dence,s; between letters and sounds in English which have been internalized
through experience. (A native speaker will also apply the same correspon-
dences to a foreign, word from any language of which he has no knowledge.)
A scheme4 to model this vrocess,must be made available, sequenced after the
decomposition algorithm, in order to be able to convert unrestricted text to
speech. The text-tb-speech System includes a phonological model having a
two-phase structure: the first phase is 4 set of rules which converts
letters to phonemes, and the second is an algorithm for placement of stress
on the converted phonemes.
This system has been implemented in BCPL on a DEC PDP-9 and on a PDP-10
in.MAC LISP.
On might ask why, with a set of letter-to-sound rules available, it
is necessary to have a lpxicon. There ire three reasons; all are restrictions
which must be Imposed om any viable letter-to-sound system. -First, it has
been observed that high-frequency wotds perhaps because of extensive use, do
not always follow letterto-sound rules. For example, the only instance in
which a final Lf] is pronounced as /v/ is in the word &amp;quot;of &amp;quot; The letter [w]
following a consonant is generally pronounced like the Da] in &amp;quot;sweet&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;twill,&amp;quot; but in the word &amp;quot;two&amp;quot; it is not pronounced&amp;quot; at all. A study5 of the
200 most frequent words in English according to the Brown Corpus6 c.ras made to
determine their regularity of pronunciation. It was found that although the
regular case is that a final [e] preceded by a single consonant (other than
lengthens the preceding vowel, four of the 200 words, i.e., &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; (compare
&amp;quot;behave,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;shave&amp;quot;), &apos;&apos;one,n some&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;come.&amp;quot; (compare &amp;quot;lOne,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ode&amp;quot;) are
exceptions. The case of initial [th3 is even more irregular among high-
F
frequency words. In most English words, initial l_th Is unvoiced as in
&amp;quot;thistle,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;thin,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;thesis,&amp;quot; However, twelve of the 200 words began with
voiced rthl.
Secondly, it must be recognized that the letter-to-sound rules which
operate within a morpheme do not necessarily apply across morph bounddries.
In particular, the pronunciation of compounds requires a lexicon. Such. words
as &amp;quot;ha.tbouse&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;potherb&amp;quot; might ethervise appear to contain the consonant
cluster th-,1, and the motpk-final silent el in &amp;quot;houseboat&amp;quot; would certainly not
be silent if the word were not recognized as a compound. The application of
letter-to-sound rules must therefore be restricted to words containing no more
than a single root.
Thirdly, foreign words which retain their original pronunciation must
be lexical entries. The entries may be made in the same way a native speaker
of English would add a foreign word to his vocabulary, i.e., by pronouncing it
-8-
as if ft were an English word (using English letter-to-sound rules) until
1:nformed of its correct pronunciation, and then placing it in his mental
lexicol.
It is apparent, then, that both morphnlogical and phonological
systems are necessary and that together, in sequence, they can proVide a
phonemic representation for any English word presented for conversion to
speech.
Although, at present, there is no interaction between the decomposition
and letter-to-phoneme algorithms, a more highly efficient system could be
developed in the future. The size of the lexicon could be reduced, for
example, by app,lication of stress placement rules to the output of the
decomposition algorithm or by omitting unnecessary phonemic representations
II. Letter-to-Sound
The conversion of a letter string to a phoneme string in the letter-to-
sound program proceeds in three stages. In the first stage, prefixes and
suffixes are detected, (cf. Figure 1) Such affixes appear in the list. of
phonological rules. Each is classified according to :1) its possible parts
of speech, (2) the possible parts of speech bf a&apos;suffix preceding it, (I) its
restriction or lack of restriction to word-final posItiop and (4) its.abirity
to change a preceding [y] to [i] or to cause the omission of a preceding Le].
Prefixes are given no further specification.
Detection of auffixes proceeds in a tight-Eo-left, longest-match-first
fashion. When no additional Duffixas can be detected, ou When a possible
suffix is judged as syntactically incompatible with its right-adjacent suffix
by a parts-of-speech test using classifications (1) and (2) above, the prO-
COSS is terminated. Finally, prefixes are detected left-to-right, also, by
longest match first. If at any time the removal of an affix would leave no
consonant or no vowel in the remainder of the word, the affix is not removed.

The domain of application of the second stage rules excludes any
previously recognized affixes and is assumed to be a single morpheme. This
stage is intended primarily for consonant rules and proceeds from the left cf
the string to the right. Extending the domaih to the whole letter string
once again for the third stage, a phonemic representation is given to affixes
and to vowels and vowel digraphs, (cf. Figure 1).
Phonemic representations are produced by a set of ordered rules which
convert a leteer string to a phoneme -suiag in a given context. Both left
and right contexts are permitted in the expression of a rule, and may contain,
variables as well as letters or phonemes Any one context may be composed of
either letters and letter variables or of phonemes and phoneme v5ariables_
Cotbination of these possibilities for both left and right contexts allows
foF four possible context types. One type of rule, for example, makes it
possible to convert a particular letter string to a phoneme string only if the
left context is a specified phoneme string and the right context is a specified
letter string.
The method of ordering rules allows converted strings which are highly
dependable to be used as context for those requiring a more complex frame-
work. Because the pronunciatioh of consonants is least dependent upon context,
phonological rules for consonants are app1ied first, i.e., in the second stage.
Rules for vowels and affixes, requiring more specificAtion of environment,
are applied in the third-and final stage. With the benefit of a previously
converted consonant framework and the option of including as context any
phoneme to the left of ma string under consideration, the task of converting
vow-6s and affixes is simplified.

Within the two sets of rules for conversion of consonants and vowels,
orftring proceeds from longer strings to shorter strings and, for eactk
string,sfrom specific context to general context. The rule for pronuncia-
tion -of ipaa, then, appears before the rules for [cc&amp;quot;1 and chl, each of
which is ordered before rules for V] and [113. Procedures for the recog-
nition of prefixes and suffixes also require an ordering: the prefixes
[cc:mil and tcon] must be ordered before [co]; any suffix ending with the
letter must be recognized before the suffix consisting of that letter
only.
As an example of ordering rules for a particular string, consider
the vowel [a] and assume that it is followed by the Letter [r]. This Cal
may be prpnounced like the [al in &amp;quot;warp,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;lariat&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;carp&amp;quot; depending
upon spetification of further context. It is pronounced like the [a] in
&amp;quot;carp&amp;quot; if it is followed by [r3 and another consonant (other than [r))
and if it is preceded by any consonant phoneme except /w/ (note &amp;quot;quarter,&amp;quot;&apos;
&amp;quot;wharf&amp;quot;) Consequently, a rule for ta3 in the context of being preceded
by the phoneme /w/ d,followed by the sequence trCf is placed in the set-
of rules. Specification of a left context in the rule for the [al in
&amp;quot;carp&amp;quot; is subsequently unnecessary. If the [a] is preceded by a /w/, this
rule will never be reached; if preceded by a vowel, a rule for vowed
digraphe will already have-applied. Using this methoO. rules may be stated
simply and without redundancy.
Development of the set of phonological rules was begun by informal
inspecti-on and reference to published works, e.g., Venezky.8 By,a process
of extensive statistical analysis, other rules were added and ordered
-14-
appropriately. The principal source of words was the Merriam Webstet &apos;Pocket
Dictionary.9 A computer print-out was generated in which all words contatn-
ing each letter and each specified cluster of letters were isolated. Within
each category, words were sorted alphabetically according to the right-hand
context of the letter(s) under consideration. In addition, Walker&apos;s rhyming
dictionary10 was used to determine pronunciation of suffixes and the effect
of suffixation on precedirig phonemes. Words from ChV Brown Corpus, the
Heritage English Dictionary11 and Stedman&apos;s Medical Dictionary12 have beeri
used in testing procedures.

The,regult of Stage 1, in thts case, is the same as the input since
no affixes are detected.
The letter Lt.] is pronounced by the most general rule in its rule
sequence, ahd [b] has only one given pronunciation. However, [1] precedes
morph-final [e3 and is itself preceded by another consonant, [b]. Tin thiE
context, [I] is syllabic.
The sequence Dlel now forms a very specific context for the third

nant, C, is neither Lrl nor The vowel (e] is morph-final and there-
fore silent.

1.) The rules for [bt] and [nib] ia which the [..b] is silent are
sequenced preceding the single rule for [b].
2.) All vowels except (.e], if located in the first syllable of a
morph, are long if followed by [Cle#1 where C is laeither [r]
nor [1]. Examples are &amp;quot;maple,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;bible,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ogle&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bugle.&amp;quot;
An exception is &amp;quot;triple.&amp;quot; The letter [e] apears to be long
in this context only if it is part of a vowel digraph, e.g.,
the vowel in &amp;quot;treble&amp;quot; is short, but the vowel digraphs in
&amp;quot;eagle,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;beetle&amp;quot; are long. Vowels in this
context which do not appear in the first syllable must be con-
verted to short pronunciations so that they will not be given
primary stress by the stress rules, e.g., &amp;quot;monocle,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;barnacle.&amp;quot;

The stress rules which have been implemented are a modification of
a set of ordered rules developed by Halle.14
Modifications fall into three
categories: (1) adjustments due to the condition that input is completely
phonemic, (2) reduction of the numbet of strE -ls to I stress
(primary) 2.stress (stress less than primary) aLLu 0 stress, and (3)
addition of special suffixrdependent stress categories.

Application of the rules proceeds in two phases. The first phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.951268294117647">
consisLb of the application of three ordered rules which are applied cycli-
cally, first to the root, then to the root and left-most suffix combined.
The &apos;process continues with one more suffix adjoined to the string under
consideration before each cycle begins until the end of the word is reached.
This cyclic phase is devoted solely to the placement of primary stress.
The second, non-cyclic phase, includes the application to the entire word
of ordered rules and reduces all but one of the primary stress marks to
secondary or zero stress.
In the following section, stress placement rules will be given in sym-
irolic form. Each rule which contains more than one case is brdker. down into
cases for whick,brief descriptions and examples are given. The rules are
listed in the order in which they apply and are marked either &amp;quot;cyclic&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;non-cyclic I, Particular modifications to each rule will be given at the end
of the discussion about that rule under the subheading Modifications. (See
Figure 3 for an explanation of notation, Figure 4 for a flow ohart of th&amp;
stress rules and Figure 5 for the complete set of stress-placement rules in

Conversion of the Main Stress Rule into algorithmic form is facilitated
by ordering the above cases in the following manner:
Algorithmic Order of Application: (1) If the final syllable is the
only syllable, or if it consists of a long vowel followedlby at least one
consonant, the final vowel receives primary strqss. Otherwise, (2) if there
4re only two syllables, or if the penultimate syllable terminates in more
than one consonant or if it consists of a long vowel followed by at least one
consonant, the penultimate vowel receives primary stress. Otherwise, (3)
the antepenultimate vowel receives primary stress.
Modifications: The presence of the optinnal vowel immeOiately preced-
ing another vowel and the presence of the morph-final vowel are necessary
-.33-
modifications of the Main Stress Rule due to the difficulty of retrieving
the long (tense) pronunciation of a laxed vowel when its orthographic
representation no longer available.
The Main Stress Rule, as developed by Halle, applies only to roots
which function as nouns and to suffixed forms. However, until parsing
methods are further developed, it will not be possible to take advantage
of known parts of speech.15 For this reason, the Main Stress Rule is cur-
rently applied to all roots.
The suffixes referred to in Condition (2) fall into two categories.
Some suffixes are marked to force stress to be placed on either the final or
the penultimate syllable of the root and suffixes under consideration. This
placement of stress replaces the MSR on the cycle in which the special
suffix is the right-most morph. These suffixes are listed below with the
phonemic representation which actually appears as input.

terminates in more than one consonant or consists of a long vowel followed
by at least one consonant, assign primary stress to thd vowel in that syll-
able. Otherwise, (4) the vowel in the third syllable to the left of the
rig14-most_stressed syllable receives stress.
Modifications: The optional vowel in pre-vocalic position appegrs in
the Stressed Syllable Rule as well as in the Main Stress Rule. Its presence
prevents words such as &amp;quot;stereobate,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;alveolate,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;heliotrope&amp;quot; from
being stressed incorrectly.
The Stressed Syllable Rule, as developed by Halle, places stress on
the final syllable of the non-nouns which have been excluded from the domain
of application of the Main Stress Rule. Words for which the dategorization
of noun/non.-noun appear to be most useful are those in which a one-syllable.

<abstract confidence="0.99297395038168">A system to convert unreltricted printed text to speech has been under for several years at approach has been to model the proces.s employed by a native speaker of English when reading aloud. In order to develop correct computational algorithms for the pronunciation of English words, it has been necessary to reflect Che basic nature of linguistic processes. Consequently, considerable emphasis has been placed on the development of morphological and phon9logical analysis, stress patterns, parsing systems and prosodic correlates. It i4 possible, using the current system, to convert any English word or string df words in a textual representation to intelligible speech. In order to effect this conversion, a number of subsystems are utilized including morphological analysis, letter-to-sound rules, stress rules and phonemic speech synthesis. Prosodic studies are now in progress; experiparameteLs for contours and timing patterns will soon be included in the system. The letter., string which represents a word is usually converted to a phoneme string in preparation for speech synthesis by a process of morphological analysis. A morph lexicon containing approximately 11,000 entries has been developed and is used in conjunction with a morph decomposition algorithm. Included in the lexicon are two major classes of morphs. One is composed of roots such as and &amp;quot;snow,&amp;quot; i.e.; words which car occur alone, and bound roots such as -celve perceive, receive, conceive), and -miss- (dismiss, missive, permissiveness). make up the second class and may be roots or tc bound morphemes. Accompanying each lexical entry is its phonemic representation, its morph class and its part(s) of speech. Algorithmic decomposition of letter-strings models the prpcedure used by a native speaker when confronted by a word which he does not immediately recognize or has previously not encountered. If the word is not immediately recognizable, i.e., if It is not in the &amp;quot;lexicon&amp;quot; of the native speaker in its entirety, an attempt will be made to break it apart into its constituent morphs. Such a process is probably used when vile reads a word siich as antidisestablishmentarianism, earthrise&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cranapplefor the first time algorithm also models the ability to recognize mutations such dropping of a final silent (observe observance), the doubling of t a final consonant (red-reddest) and preceding vocalic suffixes (glory also included, modeling the ability plural (horses, cats, dogs) or past tense (quieted, hushed, whispered), and to palatalize in appropriate contexts ( sculpt sculpture, confuse confusion). Another feature of the algorithm is a set of selectional rules which, although very simple in form, choose Ole corpect morphomic analysis from all possibilities in a large number of cases. A standard form for sequences of is compared with each possibility, and rules preferred composition are used in a pairwise comparison leading to an acceptable result. The word &amp;quot;formally&amp;quot; provides an example in which the only rule needed is one stating that a root followed by a suffix is preferable to two concatenated roots. Possible decompositionsof the word &amp;quot;formally&amp;quot; are the substitution of for final [y1 glorious). Morphophonemic rules are to give a correct pronunciation for any detected as follows(R represents &amp;quot;root&amp;quot; and S, &amp;quot;suffix&amp;quot;): form (R) + al (S) + ly (S) form (R) + ally (R) for, (R),-,mall (R) + y (S) form (R) + all (R) + y (S) It is clear that the correct decomposition is the only candidate having the form of a single root followed by suffixes. When a complete morphemic analysis fails, that is, when a word encounby speaker cannot be separated into its constituent morphemes, or when it is so infrequent in the English language that he has previously not encountered it, a &amp;quot;letter-to-sound&amp;quot; system is invoked, i.e., an attempt is made to sound out the word letter by letter. The competence of a native speaker which allows him tQ perform this conversion is based on corresponbetween letters and sounds in English which have been internalized through experience. (A native speaker will also apply the same correspondences to a foreign, word from any language of which he has no knowledge.) to model this vrocess,must be made available, sequenced after the decomposition algorithm, in order to be able to convert unrestricted text to speech. The text-tb-speech System includes a phonological model having a structure: the first phase is of rules which converts letters to phonemes, and the second is an algorithm for placement of stress on the converted phonemes. This system has been implemented in BCPL on a DEC PDP-9 and on a PDP-10 in.MAC LISP. On might ask why, with a set of letter-to-sound rules available, it is necessary to have a lpxicon. There ire three reasons; all are restrictions which must be Imposed om any viable letter-to-sound system. -First, it has been observed that high-frequency wotds perhaps because of extensive use, do not always follow letterto-sound rules. For example, the only instance in which a final Lf] is pronounced as /v/ is in the word &amp;quot;of &amp;quot; The letter [w] following a consonant is generally pronounced like the Da] in &amp;quot;sweet&amp;quot; or but in the word &amp;quot;two&amp;quot; it is not pronounced&amp;quot; at all. A the most frequent words in English according to the Brown made to determine their regularity of pronunciation. It was found that although the regular case is that a final [e] preceded by a single consonant (other than lengthens the preceding vowel, four of the 200 words, i.e., &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; (compare &amp;quot;shave&amp;quot;), some&amp;quot; and (compare &amp;quot;lOne,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ode&amp;quot;) are The case of initial [th3 is even more irregular among high- F words. In most English words, initial Is unvoiced as in &amp;quot;thistle,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;thin,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;thesis,&amp;quot; However, twelve of the 200 words began with Secondly, it must be recognized that the letter-to-sound rules which operate within a morpheme do not necessarily apply across morph bounddries. In particular, the pronunciation of compounds requires a lexicon. Such. words as &amp;quot;ha.tbouse&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;potherb&amp;quot; might ethervise appear to contain the consonant and the motpk-final silent el in &amp;quot;houseboat&amp;quot; would certainly not be silent if the word were not recognized as a compound. The application of letter-to-sound rules must therefore be restricted to words containing no more than a single root. Thirdly, foreign words which retain their original pronunciation must be lexical entries. The entries may be made in the same way a native speaker of English would add a foreign word to his vocabulary, i.e., by pronouncing it -8as if ft were an English word (using English letter-to-sound rules) until 1:nformed of its correct pronunciation, and then placing it in his mental lexicol. It is apparent, then, that both morphnlogical and phonological systems are necessary and that together, in sequence, they can proVide a phonemic representation for any English word presented for conversion to speech. Although, at present, there is no interaction between the decomposition and letter-to-phoneme algorithms, a more highly efficient system could be developed in the future. The size of the lexicon could be reduced, for example, by app,lication of stress placement rules to the output of the decomposition algorithm or by omitting unnecessary phonemic representations The conversion of a letter string to a phoneme string in the letter-tosound program proceeds in three stages. In the first stage, prefixes and suffixes are detected, (cf. Figure 1) Such affixes appear in the list. phonological rules. Each is classified according to :1) its possible parts of speech, (2) the possible parts of speech bf a&apos;suffix preceding it, (I) its restriction or lack of restriction to word-final posItiop and (4) its.abirity to change a preceding [y] to [i] or to cause the omission of a preceding Le]. given no further specification. proceeds in a tight-Eo-left, longest-match-first When no additional Duffixas detected, ou When a possible suffix is judged as syntactically incompatible with its right-adjacent suffix by a parts-of-speech test using classifications (1) and (2) above, the prO- COSS is terminated. Finally, prefixes are detected left-to-right, also, by match first. any time the removal of an affix would leave no consonant or no vowel in the remainder of the word, the affix is not removed. Example:dictatorship dict i+ ate + or + ship possible suffix analysts ship: (a) nominal suffix (b) follows nominal suffix or: (a) nominal suffix ate: (b) follows verbal suffix (a) verbal, nominal and adjectival (b) follows verbal, nominal and adject-ival suffixes dict + ate + or + ship parts of speech are compatible; analysis accepted. -10- Example:passing pa + s + s + ing possible suffix analysis ing: (a) nominal and (b) follows nominal or verbal suffix. sl (a) nominal and verbal suffix (b) follows nominal and verbal suffixes (c) appears only in unacceptable in word-final position pass + ing correct analysis Example;finishing fin + ish + ing possible suffix analysi ing: (a) nominal and verbal suffix (b) follows nominal or verbal suffix ish: (a) adjectival parts of spe-ech not compatible follows nominal adjectival suffix finish + ing correct analysis: root functions. as verb with verbal ending, ish -11- The domain of application of the second stage rules excludes any previously recognized affixes and is assumed to be a single morpheme. This stage is intended primarily for consonant rules and proceeds from the left cf the string to the right. Extending the domaih to the whole letter string once again for the third stage, a phonemic representation is given to affixes and to vowels and vowel digraphs, (cf. Figure 1). Phonemic representations are produced by a set of ordered rules which a leteer string to a in a given context. Both left and right contexts are permitted in the expression of a rule, and may contain, variables as well as letters or phonemes Any one context may be composed of letters and letter variables or of phonemes and phoneme Cotbination of these possibilities for both left and right contexts allows foF four possible context types. One type of rule, for example, makes it possible to convert a particular letter string to a phoneme string only if the left context is a specified phoneme string and the right context is a specified letter string. The method of ordering rules allows converted strings which are highly dependable to be used as context for those requiring a more complex framework. Because the pronunciatioh of consonants is least dependent upon context, phonological rules for consonants are app1ied first, i.e., in the second stage. Rules for vowels and affixes, requiring more specificAtion of environment, are applied in the third-and final stage. With the benefit of a previously converted consonant framework and the option of including as context any phoneme to the left of ma string under consideration, the task of converting and affixes -12- DENOMINATIONS Input DENOMIN + ATE + ION + S Stage DE = NOMIN + ATE + ION +S = n-m-n-+ + + - Stage dr = n-m-n + + + - Stage dx = namxn + + + di = namin + eJ + an + z (a) recognition and isolation of suffixes (b) recognition and isolation of prefixes conversion of consonants in root (a) conversion of prefix conversion root (c) conversion of suffixes 2 1 di = n.amin + ej + 3h + z Result of Stress Placement Rules All phonemes are given in IPA symbols.

Figure 1 Application of Letter-to-Sourid Rules. Within the two sets of rules for conversion of consonants and vowels, orftring proceeds from longer strings to shorter strings and, for eactk specific context to general context. The rule for pronuncia- -of appears before the rules for [cc&amp;quot;1 and chl, each of which is ordered before rules for V] and [113. Procedures for the recognition of prefixes and suffixes also require an ordering: the prefixes [cc:mil and tcon] must be ordered before [co]; any suffix ending with the letter must be recognized before the suffix consisting of that only. As an example of ordering rules for a particular string, consider the vowel [a] and assume that it is followed by the Letter [r]. This Cal be prpnounced like the &amp;quot;warp,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;lariat&amp;quot; or depending upon spetification of further context. It is pronounced like the [a] in if it is followed by [r3 and another consonant (other than [r)) and if it is preceded by any consonant phoneme except /w/ (note &amp;quot;quarter,&amp;quot;&apos; &amp;quot;wharf&amp;quot;) Consequently, a rule for ta3 in the context of being preceded by the phoneme /w/ d,followed by the sequence trCf is placed in the setof rules. Specification of a left context in the rule for the [al in is subsequently unnecessary. If the [a] is preceded by a /w/, this rule will never be reached; if preceded by a vowel, a rule for vowed digraphe will already have-applied. Using this methoO. rules may be stated simply and without redundancy. Development of the set of phonological rules was begun by informal and reference to published works, e.g., process of extensive statistical analysis, other rules were added and ordered -14appropriately. The principal source of words was the Merriam Webstet &apos;Pocket computer print-out was generated in which all words contatning each letter and each specified cluster of letters were isolated. Within each category, words were sorted alphabetically according to the right-hand context of the letter(s) under consideration. In addition, Walker&apos;s rhyming used to determine pronunciation of suffixes and the effect of suffixation on precedirig phonemes. Words from ChV Brown Corpus, the English Stedman&apos;s Medical beeri used in testing procedures. Examples of Rule Application In this section, a number of words will be analyzed according to the phonological rule program. Intermediate output, i.e.,.th&apos;e results of the first and second stages, will be provided for each word, and the rules which have been applied to produce this output will be discussed. Generalizations of these rules and rules, which are believed to be related will lA included in the discussion whenever possible. All phonemes are given in IPA Aymbols; a dash (-) is a place-holder for aletter which is to be converted in a later stage. The result of application of stress rules (to be discussed later) is given without comment following each derivation. A.

Since no other affixes are recognized, Stage 1 is terminated. Morph-initial [pt] is pronounced /t/, and [I] and [m] are given the pronunciatinrm /1/ and /m/ respectively, according to the most general rule in the rule sequence for each. (The most general rule is the final rule in the rule sequence and contains no specified context.) In Stage 3, the contexts of the vowels [o] and Le] are not among those contexts specified in the sequence of rules and are pronounced according to the final, context-independent rule. The vowel [al, on the other hand, precedes anokber vowc1 and, for this reason is lengthened (tensed). The suffix [-Eic] is word-final and receives the pronunciation /11(/, In the final result, stress rules have beer) applied and unstressed non-tense vowels have been reduced.

Vowels in this context which do not appear in the first syllable must be converted to short pronunciations so that they will not be given primary stress by the stress rules, e.g., &amp;quot;monocle,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;barnacle.&amp;quot; -17- C.

The letter [dlis palatalized in some cases, e.g., &amp;quot;special,&amp;quot; (context: [V iV]) &amp;quot;ancient,&amp;quot; (context: ill). It ass-igned the phoneme /d/ later in its rule sequence if it is followed 11? Tel, 01 or [y].

Moving on to Stage 3, the vowel Cel receives the pronunciation /0 given by its most geperal rule. The vowel (a] follows the rule given in the previous example.

Application of the rules proceeds in two phases. The first phase consisLb of the application of three ordered rules which are applied cyclically, first to the root, then to the root and left-most suffix combined. The &apos;process continues with one more suffix adjoined to the string under consideration before each cycle begins until the end of the word is reached. This cyclic phase is devoted solely to the placement of primary stress. The second, non-cyclic phase, includes the application to the entire word of ordered rules and reduces all but one of the primary stress marks to secondary or zero stress. In the following section, stress placement rules will be given in symirolic form. Each rule which contains more than one case is brdker. down into cases for whick,brief descriptions and examples are given. The rules are listed in the order in which they apply and are marked either &amp;quot;cyclic&amp;quot; or Particular modifications to each rule will be given at the end the that rule under the subheading Modifications.(See Figure 3 for an explanation of notation, Figure 4 for a flow ohart of th&amp; stress rules and Figure 5 for the complete set of stress-placement rules in linguistic notation. -3 1- Stress Rule(cyclic) 4 Cl I / ( Condition: (1) no stress placement to the left of a prefix boundary (2) if right-most morph is suffix, test special stress placement category ; assign tl stressl or skip cycle according to category. 1.(Maximum string; all parentheses removed) V 1 c stress l kiflong 0 Assign 1 stress to the vowel in preceding a weak by morph-final syllable containing a short vowel and zero or more consonants: 1 difficult diffmkAlt (b) Assign 1 stress to the vowel in a syllable preceding a weak cluster followed by a morph-final vowel: 1 oregano )rEwbkno Assign 1 stress to the vowel in a syllable vowel by a morph-final syllabIe containing short vowel zero or consonants: 1 secretariat sEkrEtatriakt (d) Assign 1 stress to the vowel in a syllable preceding a vowel by vowel: 1 oratorio Oraktlrio -32- Case 2.

Otherwise, (2) 4re only two syllables, or if the penultimate syllable terminates in more one consonant or if it consists of a long vowel at least one consonant, the penultimate vowel receives primary stress. Otherwise, (3) the antepenultimate vowel receives primary stress. Modifications:The presence of the optinnal vowel immeOiately preceding another vowel and the presence of the morph-final vowel are necessary -.33modifications of the Main Stress Rule due to the difficulty of retrieving the long (tense) pronunciation of a laxed vowel when its orthographic representation no longer available. The Main Stress Rule, as developed by Halle, applies only to roots which function as nouns and to suffixed forms. However, until parsing methods are further developed, it will not be possible to take advantage known parts of this reason, the Main Stress Rule is currently applied to all roots. The suffixes referred to in Condition (2) fall into two categories. Some suffixes are marked to force stress to be placed on either the final or the penultimate syllable of the root and suffixes under consideration. This placement of stress replaces the MSR on the cycle in which the special suffix is the right-most morph. These suffixes are listed below with the phonemic representation which actually appears as input.

(b) Most words of four or more syllables are given alternate pronunciations corresponding to the placement of MENT in either this category or in the category of regular stress placement, e.g., 1 1 1 / medicament / 1 1 NESS: disinteTestedness, haphazardness 1 1 1 2 OR: 1 governor, warrantor, incubator 1 1 1 RY: heraldry, wizardry, charlantanry SELF: No evidence of stress change 1 2 SHIP: (a) umpireship 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 advocateship, cardinalship SOME: No evidence of stress change 1 1 TY: sheriffalty, suzerainty 1 1 1 URE: judicature, triplicature, caricature other suffixes not above categories receive stress accorcUng to the general form of the Main Stress Rule. -38- Syllable Rule(cyclic) / (( sVtress Conditions: (1) Y contains no primary stress (2) no stress placement to the left of a prefix boundary 1.(Maximum string: all parentheses removed) / Y stress Assign I stress to the in syllable a cluster followed by a vowel and any number of consonants which followed by right-most priniary-stressed vowel: oxygenate aksijEnet (stress on final syllable later reduced) Assign I stress to in a syllable preceding a vowel followed by a vowel and any number of consonants which is followed by the right-most primary-stressed vowel: ® 1 stereobate stEriobet (stress on final syllable later reduced) 2.(Innermost parenthesized string excluded) x [.1 Assign I stress to the vowel syllables the left of the right-most primary-stressed vowel: 1 1 propaganda praplkgAnda.e. left-most stressed vowel later reduced) 3.(Next innermost parenthesized string excluded) V stress] / [i stress] (a) Assign 1 stress to the vowel one syllable to the left of the right-most primary-stressed vowel, i.e., to the vowel in the first syllable of the root: 1 hormone h)rmon -39- Case 4. (All parenthesized strings excluded) V-..0 1 stressi / x c 0 (a) Assign I stress to the volVel in the last syllable, i.e&apos;., to the vowel in the only syllable of the root: stand stAnd (assigning 1 stress to a vowel which already carries I stress has no effect unless the rule specifies as in the Compound Stress Rule, that the vowel must previously be 1-stressed.) Order of Application:(1) If the right-most syllable containing primary stress is the left-most syllable in the word, no stress is assimed. Otherwise, (2) if the syllable preceding the right-most stressed syllable is-the only syllable preceding it, assign primary stress to the vowel in that syllable. Otherwise, (3) if the second syllable to the left of the right-most stressed syllable is the left-most syllable, or if it in more than one or of a long vowel followed by at least one consonant, assign primary stress to thd vowel in that syllable. Otherwise, (4) the vowel in the third syllable to the left of the rig14-most_stressed syllable receives stress. Modifications:The optional vowel in pre-vocalic position appegrs in the Stressed Syllable Rule as well as in the Main Stress Rule. Its presence prevents words such as &amp;quot;stereobate,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;alveolate,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;heliotrope&amp;quot; from being stressed incorrectly. The Stressed Syllable Rule, as developed by Halle, places stress on final syllable of which have been excluded from the domain of application of the Main Stress Rule. Words for which the dategorization appear to be most useful are those in which a one-syllable. -40- 12 precedes a one-syllable root or bound morpheme, e.g., 1 1 2 1 , U.nsul] because there are many tore verbs of V V this sort than nouns, the Stressed Syllable Rule has been mod.ified to prevent the retraction of stress into a prefix. The effect.of this modification is to produce only the verbal pronunciation of two-syllable noun/verb pairs. Another more positive, effect is the correct placement of stress in trtrbs 1 1 1 such as edit,i. inhibit and pummel. However, two-syllable nouns of the form which. have no verbal counterpart are stressed incorrectly, e.g. 1 1 empire, inverse. (This modification will be removed or changed after a parsing algorithm is incorporated in the system.) Stress Rule(cyclic) /1tX (V) tl aress] 1.(Maximum string) 1 stress] [1 stress (a) Assign 1 stress to the vowel three syllables to the left of a primary-stressed vowel occurring in the last syllable if the. following syllable contains only a vowel: CD 1 heliotrope hiliotrop (strtss in last syllable later reduced) 2.(Parenthesized stting excluded) V 1 stress] (a) Assign 1 stress to the vowel two syllables to the left of a primary-stressed vowel occurring in the last syllable: 1 1 gelinate j13 t7net (stress in first syllable later deleted; stress in last syllable later reduced) -41- Order of Application:(1) If there are at least two syllables preceding a primary-stressed vowel in the last syllable of the phoneme string, and if Ole first of these two syllables is composed of more than a single vowel, place primary stregs on the vowel two syllables to the left of the vowel with primary stress. Otherwise, (2) if there are at least three syllables to the left, the second of which is composed of a single vowel, place primary stress on the vowel three syllables to the left of the vowel with primary stress. Otherwise, (3) no stress Assignment is made. 1 2 1 2 Exceptions;Note that words sucn as peregrinate, oxygenate and 1 2 metropolitanate which are correctly stressed Dy the Stressed Syllable Rule are stressed incorrectly, thereafter,by the Alternating Stress Rule. Modification:The optional vowel in pre-vocalic position appears in the Alternating Stress Rule as well as in the Main Stress and &apos;Stressed Syllable rules. Modification:The restriction &apos;of the Alternating Stress Rule to words in which a prefix boundary does not precede the final primarystressed syllable could be constrained to uerbs. Such a constraint would provide the correct stress placement in nouns and adjectives such as 1 2 I 2 1 2 1 2 multiform, contraband; intercept and miniskirt while retaining correct. 2 1 Z 1 2 1 stress placement in the verbs intercept„ contradict-and comprehend. Such a modification would require moving the Strong First Syllable Rule in scheme to follow the Compound Stress Rule, aseigning [2 in the same context in which (1 stress] was previously assigned. This-modification has already been implemented in this program for independent reasons. -42-L is discussed under the heading Modificationsin the Strong First Syllable &apos;Rule.

ModificaEion:The single required consonant preceding the primary 1 vowel has been changed from (zero one_consonan* C (exactly one consonant) so that pre-vocalic vowels are not shortened. Stress Rule(non-cyclic) This rule, as developed by Halle, applies to both compounds and non-compounds. As it applies to words converted by letter-to-phoneme rules in the program, and therefore to non-compounds only, its effect is to locate the primary stress which is to be retained. All other primary stress is reduced to secondary. Halle has used the Nuclear Stress Rule for both phraselevel stress and the reduction of secondary to tertiary stress in lexical. items. Neither is necessary in this algorithm; the Nuclear Stress Rule has therefore been omitted. / ( [7stress Condition: (1) Y contains no 1 stress (2) if right most morph is a suffix, check for special stress retention or stress exclusion category and reassign (1 stressl according ..to category 1.(Maximum string) [ 1 stress&apos;) EX -stress j Retain stress on a vowel if it followed by at least one a word-final /1/.

Otherwise, (2) if the right-most vowel with primary stress is followed by at least one more syllable, Elie right-most of whiCh is not composed of an unstressed /i/, it retains primary stress and all other primary stress is reduced to secondary. (3) If the right-most vowels with primary stress is (a) the right-most vowel in the word, or (b) right-most with the exception of a final syllable coMposed of an unstressed /i/, the first primary-stressed vowel to its left retains primary stress and all other primary stress is reduced to secondary. Modifications:As mentioned previously, input to the stress rules from the letter-to-phoneme program dos not include compounds. The part of -the ruie designed for compounds is, thezefore, omitted. /i/ rule formerly contained the letter [y] instead of L-stressiwhich has been substituted due to unavailability of the original brthography. -45- The suffixes referred to in Condition (2) fall into two categories. Those suffixes discussed under Condition (2) of the Main Stress Rule which do not affect stress placement are excepted from the dmain of the Compound Stress Rule if they are either word-final or precede another word-final suffix in the same category. The other category of suffixes is marked for special stress retention. The following suffixes retain primary stress in word-final position under Condition (2) of EE: EER: ESCE: ESQUE: ETTE: OON: the Compound Stress Rule: 2 1 2 1 trainee, legatee 2 1 2 1 buccaneer, engineer 2 1 2 1 luminesce, acquiesce 2 1 2 1 arabesque, Romanesque 2 1 2 1 marionette, majorette 2 1 1 macaroon, baboon following suffix does not retain primary stress on the penultimate syllable under Condition (2) of the Compound Stress Rule: 12 21 Note: Tilts categorization syllabic M does not position. The same in [ithm], although is equivalent to the statement that function as a syllable in morph-final stress pattern appears in word ending it is not included here as a suffix, e.g., 1 2 1 2 logarithm, algorithm. The same categorization should be extended to morph-final syllabic t13. However, it does not function as a suffix, e.g., 1 corpuscle - .4 6 - The original set of stress rules included the Trisyllabic Shortening Rule at this point in the ordering. The rule was stated as follows: V 1 ss ] c V 41:71ongl / t X C &apos;CV Y [. stre LstresS1 Condition: (1) does not apply to /u/ Test results indicated misptonunciations arising from its application. A undertaken to determine the usefulness of this rulp and to uncover problem areas which might lead to a more proper resolution of observed effects for which the Trisyllabic Shortening Rule was formulated. found that a restatement of phonological rules, including the requirement of a short vowel in a one-syllable root preceding a single consonant, and certain suffixes, obviated the need for the Trisyllabic Shortdning Rule in the set of stress rules.

Modifications:This rule has been extended to include both the-first syllable of the Toot and the first syllable of the left-most prefix. This rule has been moved to follow the Compound Stress Rule to prevent the retention of primary stress in prefixes by the Compound Stress Rule words such as recruitand Rule(non-cyclic) -stress V C7 Y2 stres;1 CV Conditibn: (1) if right-most morph is a suffix, check for stress exclusion category, Application:(only one case of the Cursory Rule) The vowel following the primary-stressed vowel, if it is not the last vowel in the word, is shortened and its stress removed. 1 Examples:infirmary, cursory&amp;quot;, curative (/ef-P /141.. / ; later reduced to /9 /-) Modifications:Pre-vocalic vowels are mit shortened. suffixes discussed under the Main Stress do not affect are excepted from the domain of the Cursefry Rule if they are either word-final or precede another, word-final suffix in the same category. -48- Reduction Rul,e(non-cyclic, applicable to all vowels having required context) 4 -stress1 X -long 1.
