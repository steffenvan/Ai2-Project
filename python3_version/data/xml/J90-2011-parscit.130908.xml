This volume discusses the analysis of
verse metrics and, more generally, the
sound structure of all spoken language.
While phonological theory remains a cen-
tral concern for most of the authors of this
coherent collection of articles, the emphasis
is placed on metrical theory, formulating
and illustrating metrical principles within
the tradition of generative metrics as well
as within competing traditions.

The Journal of Semantics is the leading international forum for the rapid
developments that have taken place over the last decade in the field of
natural language semantics. Increasingly, its crucial relevance has been
recognized in all areas of natural language research. High formal
standards have been set as it has striven to meet the growing need for
computational and empirical adequacy. This process has been aided by
the intense interdisciplinary exchange and co-operation that has
simultaneously occurred, setting new standards for the field as a whole
and working towards a true integration.
The Journal&apos;s editors and advisory board are composed of internationally
established specialists, and it is firmly rooted in the interdisciplinary study
of natural language semantics, with linguistics, psychology, philosophy,
and artificial intelligence as the major contributing disciplines.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99476325">
Manuscripts to Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or
A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an
informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact
the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.964735">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.882353315789474">
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational
linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper
depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is
the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of
the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject matter.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not
copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any
version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such
publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper
tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by
all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary
under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results
of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical
correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is
reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.
The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:

<abstract confidence="0.988461">This volume discusses the analysis of verse metrics and, more generally, the sound structure of all spoken language. While phonological theory remains a central concern for most of the authors of this coherent collection of articles, the emphasis is placed on metrical theory, formulating and illustrating metrical principles within the tradition of generative metrics as well as within competing traditions.</abstract>

The leading interdisciplinary forum for natural language semantics Journal of SEMANTICS Includes: * Contributions from the fields of philosophy, psychology, linguistics and artificial intelligence * Original research papers * Review articles * Notes, discussions, and book reviews The Journal of Semantics is the leading international forum for the rapid developments that have taken place over the last decade in the field of natural language semantics. Increasingly, its crucial relevance has been recognized in all areas of natural language research. High formal standards have been set as it has striven to meet the growing need for computational and empirical adequacy. This process has been aided by the intense interdisciplinary exchange and co-operation that has simultaneously occurred, setting new standards for the field as a whole and working towards a true integration. The Journal&apos;s editors and advisory board are composed of internationally established specialists, and it is firmly rooted in the interdisciplinary study of natural language semantics, with linguistics, psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence as the major contributing disciplines.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.970841090909091">A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject matter. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. CORRESPONDENCE: category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. TO THE EDITOR: includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.</abstract>
