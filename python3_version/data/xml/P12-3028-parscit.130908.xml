The primary function of S.E.R. technology is
simple and clear: as a realtime risk control
management technology to assist monitoring huge
amount of new media related information and
giving a warning for utility users’ sake in
efficiency way.
In general, S.E.R. technology constantly
crawling all new media based information data
relating to the client 24-hour a day so that the
influential opinion/reports can be monitored,
recorded, conveniently analyzed and more
importantly is to send a warning signal before the
issue outburst and ruining the authorities’
reputation. These monitor and alert services are
based on the socialnomics theory and provide two
main sets of service functionalities to clients for
access online: Monitor and alert of new media
related information under the concept of cloud
computing including two functionalities.
First functionality is the monitoring set. With
the dramatic growth of Web’s popularity, time
becomes the most crucial factor. Monitoring
functionalities of S.E.R. technology provides an
access to the service platform realtime and online.
All scalable mass social data coming from social
network, forum, news portals, blogosphere of its
login time, its social account and the content are
monitored and recorded. In order to find key

<bodyText confidence="0.99956468">
Social Event Radar is a new social
networking-based service platform, that
aim to alert as well as monitor any
merchandise flaws, food-safety related
issues, unexpected eruption of diseases or
campaign issues towards to the
Government, enterprises of any kind or
election parties, through keyword
expansion detection module, using
bilingual sentiment opinion analysis tool
kit to conclude the specific event social
dashboard and deliver the outcome helping
authorities to plan “risk control” strategy.
With the rapid development of social
network, people can now easily publish
their opinions on the Internet. On the other
hand, people can also obtain various
opinions from others in a few seconds even
though they do not know each other. A
typical approach to obtain required
information is to use a search engine with
some relevant keywords. We thus take the
social media and forum as our major data
source and aim at collecting specific issues
efficiently and effectively in this work.

opinion leaders and influential, the S.E.R.
technology used social network influence analysis
to identify a node and base on the recorded data to
sort and analyze opinion trends statistics for every
customer’s needs.
Second functionality is alert module. Alert
functionalities of the S.E.R. technology
automatically give a warning text-messages or an
e-mail within 6 hours whenever the golden
intersection happened, meaning the 1-day moving
average is higher than the 7-days moving average
line, in order to plan its reaction scheme in early
stage.
In empirical studies, we present our application
of a Social Event Radar. We also use a practical
case to illustrate our system which is applied in
industries and society. The rest of this paper is
organized as follows. Preliminaries and related
works are reviewed in Section 2. The primary
functionality and academic theory are mentioned in
Section 3. Practical example and influence are
explored in Section 4. S.E.R. detail operations are
shown in Section 5. Finally, this paper concludes
with Section 6.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.982584" genericHeader="introduction">
2 Preliminaries
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955">
For the purpose of identifying the opinions in the
blogosphere, First of all, mining in blog entries
from the perspective of content and sentiment is
explored in Section 2.1. Second, sentiment analysis
in blog entries is discussed in Section 2.2. Third,
information diffusion is mentioned in Section 2.3.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996383">
2.1 Topic Detection in Blog Entries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980805555556">
Even within the communities of similar interests,
there are various topics discussed among people. In
order to extract these subjects, cluster-liked
methods Viermetz (2007) and Yoon (2009)are
proposed to explore the interesting subjects.
Topic-based events may have high impacts on
the articles in blogosphere. However, it is
impossible to view all the topics because of the
large amount. By using the technique of topic
detection and tracking (Wang, 2008), the related
stories can be identified with a stream of media. It
is convenient for users who intend to see what is
going on through the blogosphere. The subjects are
not only classified in the first step, but also rank
their importance to help user read these articles.
After decomposing a topic into a keyword set,
a concept space is appropriate for representing
relations among people, article and keywords. A
concept space is graph of terms occurring within
objects linked to each other by the frequency with
which they occur together. Hsieh (2009) explored
the possibility of discovering relations between
tags and bookmarks in a folksonomy system. By
applying concept space, the relationship of topic
can be measured by two keyword sets.
Some researches calculate the similarity to
identify the characteristic. One of the indicators is
used to define the opinion in blog entries which is
“Blogs tend to have certain levels of topic
consistency among their blog entries.” The
indicator uses the KL distance to identify the
similarity of blog entries (Song, 2007). However,
the opinion blog is easy to read and do not change
their blog topics iteratively, this is the key factor
that similarity comparison can be applied on this
feature.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99986">
2.2 Opinion Discovery in Blog Entries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945964285714">
The numbers of online comments on products or
subjects grow rapidly. Although many comments
are long, there are only a few sentences containing
distinctive opinion. Sentiment analysis is often
used to extract the opinions in blog pages.
Opinion can be recognized from various
aspects such as a word. The semantic relationship
between opinion expression and topic terms is
emphasized (Bo, 2004). It means that using the
polarity of positive and negative terms in order to
present the sentiment tendency from a document.
Within a given topic, similarity approach is often
used to classify the sentences as opinions.
Similarity approach measures sentence similarity
based on shared words and synonym words with
each sentence in documents and makes an average
score. According to the highest score, the
sentences can assign to the sentiment or opinion
category (Varlamis, 2008).
Subjectivity in natural language refers to
aspects of language used to express opinions and
evaluation. Subjectivity classification can prevent
the polarity classifier from considering irrelevant
misleading text. Subjectivity detection can
compress comments into much shorter sentences
which still retain its polarity information
comparable to the entire comments (Rosario, 2004;
Yu, 2003).

2.3 Information Diffusion in Internet
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997456">
The phenomenon of information diffusion is
studied through the observation of evolving social
relationship among bloggers (Gill, 2004; Wang,
2007). It is noted that a social network forms with
bloggers and corresponding subscription
relationship.
Information diffusion always concerns with
temporal evolution. The blog topics are generated
in proportion to what happened in real world.
Media focus stands for how frequently and
recently is the topic reported by new websites.
User attention represents how much do bloggers
like to read news stories about the topic. By
utilizing these two factors, the news topics are
ranked within a certain news story (Wang, 2008).
The phenomenon of information diffusion is
driven by outside stimulation from real world
(Gruhl, 2004). It focuses on the propagation of
topics from blog to blog. The phenomenon can
discuss from two directions. One is topic-oriented
model which provides a robust structure to the
whole interesting terms that bloggers care about.
The other is individual-oriented model which helps
users figure out which blogger has information
impact to others.

3 BUILDING BLOCKS OF S.E.R
TECHNOLOGY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985421052632">
The core technology building block of S.E.R.
technology is the central data processing system
that currently sits in III’s project processing center.
This core software system is now complete with a
set of processing software that keeps analyzing the
recorded data to produce reports and analytical
information, all those monitoring functionalities
provided to subscribers.
Two important technology building blocks for
the success of the S.E.R. are the bilingual
sentiment opinion analysis (BSOA) technique, and
social network influence analysis (SNIA)
technique. These techniques are keys to the
successful collection and monitoring of new media
information, which in turn is essential for
identifying the key opinion web-leaders and
influential intelligently. The following sections
apply the academic theory combining with
practical functionality into the S.E.R.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997853">
3.1 Bilingual Sentiment Opinion Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982543944444444">
BSOA technique under the S.E.R. technology is
implemented along with lexicon based and domain
knowledge. The research team starts with concept
expansion technique for building up a measurable
keyword network. By applying particularly

algorithm as shown in Figure 1, so that to rule out
the irrelevant factors in an accurate and efficiency
way.
Aim at the Chinese applications; we develop the
system algorithm based on the specialty of Chinese
language. The key approach crawl the hidden
sentiment linking words, and then to build the
association set. We can, therefore, identify feature-
oriented sentiment orientation of opinion more
conveniently and accurately by using this
association set analysis.

3.2 Social Network Influence Analysis

Who are the key opinion leaders in the opinion
world? How critical do the leaders diffusion power
matters? Who do they influence? The more
information we have, so as the social networking
channels, the more obstacles of monitoring and
finding the real influential we are facing right now.
Within a vast computer network, the individual
computers are on what so-called the periphery of
the network. Those nodes who have many links
pointing to them is not always the most influential
in the group. We use a more sophisticated
algorithm that takes into account both the direct
and indirect links in the network. This SNIA
technique under the S.E.R. technology provides a
more accurate evaluation and prediction of who
really influences thought and affects the whole.
Using the same algorithm, in reverse, we can

3.3 The monitoring methodology of agenda-
tendency
In the web-society, the system architecture of
monitoring and identifying on vast web reviews is
one thing, being aware of when to start the risk
control action plan is another story. We develop 3
different forms of analysis charts - long term
average moving line,tendency line,1-day, 7-day
and monthly average moving line. For example,
the moment when the 1-day moving average line is
higher than the 7-day moving average line, it
means the undiscovered issue is going to be
outburst shortly, and it is the time the authority to
take action dealing with the consequences. One
news report reconfirmed that a wrong manipulated
marketing promotion program using an “iPhone5”
smart-phone as its complementary gift and was
shown on the analysis chart 9 days before it
revealed on the television news causing the
company’s reputation being damaged badly.

S.E.R. research and development team built up the
DEPH [di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate] searching
website within 2 days and made an officially
announcement in June. 1st, 2011 under the
pressure of the outbreak of Taiwan’s food
contamination storm, which in general estimated
causing NT$10,000 million approximately profit
lost in Taiwan’s food industry. This DEPH website
was to use the S.E.R. technology not only to
collect 5 authorities’ data (Food and Drug
Administration of Health Department in Executive
Yuan, Taipei City government) 24 hours a day but
also gathering 3 news portals-Google, Yahoo,
and UDN, 303 web online the latest news
information approx., allowed every personal could
instantly check whether their everyday food/drink

In order to develop new business in the word-of-
mouth market, Lion Travel which is the biggest
travel agency in Taiwan sat up a branch
“Xinmedia”. The first important thing for a new
company to enter the word-of-mouth market is to
own a sufficient number of experts who can affect
most people’s opinion to advertisers, however, this
is a hard work right now. S.E.R. helps Xinmedia to
easily find many traveling opinion leader, and
those leaders can be products spokesperson to
more accurately meet the business needs. More and
more advertisers agree the importance of the word-
of-mouth market, because Xinmedia do created
better accomplishments for advertisers’ sales by
experts’ opinion.

cellphone “One X” is getting popular than others.
From the news, we know this cellphone is
upcoming release to the market and it becomes a
topical subject.

Beyond the products, some details are discussed
with product in a topic. Thus, we use TF-IDF and
fixed keyword to extract the important issue. These
issues are coordinated with time slice and
generated dynamically. It points out the most
discussed issue with the product. In Figure 4, In
this case, the “screen” issue is raising up after “ics”
(ice cream sandwich, an android software version)
may become the most concern issue that people
care about.
With this benefit, we can accept different domain

apply training mechanism automatically if the
tagging word arrive the training standard.
As shown in Figure 5, top side shows the
analyzed information of whole topic thread. We
just show the first post of this thread. As we can
see, we provide three training mode, Category,
Sentiment and Same Problem. The red word shows
the positive sentiment and blue word shows the
negative sentiment respectively. The special case is
the “Same Problem”. In forum, some author may
just type “+1”, “me2”, “me too” to show they face
the same problem. Therefore, we have to identify
what they agreed or what they said. We solve this
problem by using the relation between the same
problem word and its name entity.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998529">
In this networked era, known social issues get
monitored and analyzed over the Net. Information
gathering and analysis over Internet have become
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992555">
167
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939548387097">
so important for efficient and effective responses
to social events. S.E.R technology is an Internet
mining technology that detects monitors and
analyzes more than Net-related social incidents.
An impending event that’s not yet attracted any
attention, regardless of whether of known nature or
of undetermined characteristic, gets lit up on the
S.E.R radar screen – provided a relevant set of
detection conditions are set in the S.E.R engine.
S.E.R technology, like its related conventional
counterparts, is certainly capable for monitoring
and analyzing commercial and social, public
events. It is the idea “to detect something uncertain
out there” that distinguishes S.E.R from others.
It is also the same idea that is potentially
capable of saving big financially for our society. It
may seem to be – in fact it is – hindsight to talk
about the DEPH food contamination incident of
Taiwan in 2011, discussing how it would have
been detected using this technology. But, the
“morning-after case analysis” provides a good
lesson to suggest that additional tests are
worthwhile – thus the look into another issue of
food additives: the curdlan gum.
Certainly there is – at this stage – not yet any
example of successful uncovering of impending
events of significant social impact by this
technology, but with proper setting of an S.E.R
engine by a set of adequate parameters, the team is
confident that S.E.R will eventually reveal
something astonishing – and helpful to our society.
