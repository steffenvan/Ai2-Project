Subscriptions to CL are available only through membership in
the ACL. Each subscription includes both hard-copy and
microfiche versions of the journal.
Back issues of the AJCL may be ordered at annual rates of
$15 for orders from personal members, $30 from institutional
members. The first five volumes (1974-1978) are available
only on microfiche; add $3 for first class mailing in North
America; $6 for air printed mailing overseas. Volumes 6 — 9
(1980-1983) are available in both hard-copy and microfiche
form; add $6 for first class, $12 for air printed mail. The
AJCL was not published during 1979:
Annual dues are $15 for personal and $30 for institutional
memberships. A joint membership for couples that provides
one subscription is available for $20. The dues payment in-
cludes bulk or surface mailing fees. First class mailing is
available in North America for an additional $6; air printed
mailing is available overseas for an additional $12.
Address changes should be sent to the ACL Secretary-
Treasurer.
Payments for dues or back issues should be made payable to
the Association for Computational Linguistics (or ACL). Pay-
ments sent to the ACL Secretary-Treasurer should be payable
in US dollars. Payments from people in Europe or with Swiss
accounts should be sent to the European Chapter Treasurer;
they can be paid in Swiss francs, by personal checks in the
currency of that country, or by a banker&apos;s draft that credits
account 141.880.LAV at the Union Bank of Switzerland, 8 rue
de Rhone, CH-1211 Geneva 11, SWITZERLAND. European
residents can get information on currency conversion values
from the European Chapter Secretary.
A Note from the Editor:
At the 21st Annual Meeting of the ACL at MIT in 1983, one of the sessions was
devoted to the formal properties of various linguistic formalisms and to the
significance of these results. This Special Issue is an aftermath of that session,
although the list of participants is somewhat different.
In their 1982 paper &amp;quot;Natural Languages and Context-Free Languages&amp;quot;,
Geoffrey Pullum and Gerald Gazdar examined all the published claims that natural
languages might not be context-free and found them wanting. The contributions
by Postal and Langendoen and by Pullum to this issue continue to explore this
question. Postal and Langendoen argue in &amp;quot;English and the Class of Context-Free
Languages&amp;quot; that English is not context-free by examining the class of sentences
exhibiting the sluicing construction, such as Joe discussed some bourbon hater but it&apos;s
not known which bourbon hater. Pullum&apos;s paper &amp;quot;On Two Recent Attempts to
Show that English Is Not a CFL&amp;quot; attacks the linguistic data on which Postal and
Langendoen&apos;s argument is based, as well as those underlying a similar claim by
James Higginbotham. The second contribution by Langendoen and Postal is a
rejoinder to Pullum&apos;s paper.
Robert Berwick&apos;s &amp;quot;Strong Generative Capacity, Weak Generative Capacity, and
Modern Linguistic Theories&amp;quot; is a discussion of some of the formal properties of
Lexical Functional Grammar and the Government-Binding (GB) version of
transformational grammar. It contains the first published formalization of GB, a
proof that GB languages under this formalization are recursive and that they have
the arithmetic growth property.
Finally, my contribution to this issue is an expanded version of a survey of
formal results about various linguistic theories and a discussion of how these results
can be used as lower bounds and as upper bounds on acceptable theories.
