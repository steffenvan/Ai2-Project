This paper presents a study of the effects of
syntax and melodic configuration on turn-
taking in Southern British English. Using
dialogue materials, two perception
experiments were carried out. In the first,
subjects heard dialogue fragments in which
syntactic completeness and melodic contour
were systematically varied, and were asked
whether they expected a subsequent turn
exchange or not. In the second, subjects
were presented with short speaker
exchanges taken from the same material,
and asked whether they thought the first
speaker had intended to cede the turn or not.
The results suggest that syntactic completion
or non-completion is the main factor in
predicting turn-taking behaviour. Only one
melodic contour, the high level tone H* %,
appears to operate as a turn holding device,
regardless of whether the utterance is
grammatically complete or not. The results
of this study were found to be similar to
those of a study of Dutch turn-taking.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974130434783">
Most studies of the intonational cues to turn-
taking have been carried out qualitatively within
the theoretical framework of Conversation
Analysis (e.g. Wells &amp; Macfarlane 1998, Selting
1996). An exception to this is the study by Ford
and Thompson (1996), who found that turn-
changes in American English mostly appear
when melodic, syntactic and pragmatic
completion coincide. Two recent studies of the
melodic cues to turn-taking in Dutch (Caspers
2000, 2001) motivate the present study, which
uses comparable English data to replicate as far
as possible the perception experiments carried
out in Caspers (2001). On the basis of the
findings for Dutch we expected syntactic
completeness to be the overriding predictor of a
possible turn change. Where melody has an
effect, we hypothesised that, as in Dutch, the
high level tone was likely to signal more to
come and that no subsequent turn change would
be expected (Caspers 1998). We also hoped to
gain some insight into possible similarities and
differences between the two languages.

The data used for these experiments was taken
from Map Task data, recorded according to the
Map Task conventions described in Anderson et
al. (1991), and collected as part of the IViE
project (Grabe et al. in preparation). We chose
dialogues recorded in Cambridge, as they
represented most closely the standard southern
variety of British English.

2 Data Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999826222222222">
Following the method used by Caspers (2001),
two complete Map Tasks (approximately 30
minutes of speech) were divided into inter-
pausal units (IPUs, cf. Koiso et al. 1998) using a
pause threshold of 100ms. Boundaries were then
categorised according to three criteria.
Firstly, each IPU boundary was identified as
either occurring within the turn of the same
speaker, (category HOLD) or involving a change
of speaker (category CHANGE). Secondly, the
text before each IPU boundary was judged for
syntactic completion. If the utterance was at
least potentially complete at that point the
boundary was categorised as syntactically
complete, otherwise as ’not complete’. Finally,
we selected a set of IPUs according to their final
contour, identified in terms of the British system
of ’nuclear tones’ (fall, rise etc.) and in
autosegmental-metrical terms of final pitch
accent and subsequent boundary tone.
(Following Gussenhoven et al. (1999) we
included the possibility of a boundary tone that
was neither low nor high, transcribed as %.) We
identified IPUs ending in one of the following
contours: a high rise (H* H%), a high level (H*
%), a fall-rise (H*L H%), a fall (H*L L%) and a
truncated fall (H*L %).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977052631579">
In the first experiment, subjects were presented
with a dialogue fragment ending at an IPU
boundary. The subjects’ task was to predict what
happens next, i.e. whether the speaker holds the
turn, or holds after a brief backchannel response,
or cedes the turn. In the second experiment we
again asked subjects to judge what the first
speaker had intended - to continue or to cede the
turn, but under slightly different conditions: this
time subjects heard brief exchanges involving
both speakers. This was to see if the presence of
an actual response influenced subjects’
judgement of the first speaker’s intention. The
same subjects took part in both experiments.
They were 25 native speakers of Southern
British English, 9 men and 16 women, aged
between 19 and 54, only 7 of whom had some
background in linguistics. No hearing
difficulties were reported.

</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.964859">
4.1 Stimulus material
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999666">
For the first experiment, the stimuli consisted of
dialogue fragments, around 8 to 13 seconds in
length, and ending in an IPU. The fragments
were chosen such that they ended according to
the following four conditions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.972629">
(i) turn exchange plus syntactic completion
(ii) turn exchange minus syntactic completion
(iii) turn hold plus syntactic completion
(iv) turn hold minus syntactic completion
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999699375">
The five contours chosen were as listed in
paragraph 2 above. For all but the high rise (H*
H%) two stimuli were chosen for each of the
above conditions, giving 32 stimuli. As syntactic
completion could, of course, include
interrogatives, which would be highly likely to
project a turn change, these were avoided for all
but one stimulus for the fall-rise contour and
three for the high rise. We found very few cases
of the high rise in the English data, an
interesting finding in itself, and it was not
possible to find examples for each condition;
only six cases were used altogether, four
syntactically complete (two interrogatives and
two declaratives) and two syntactically
incomplete.

<bodyText confidence="0.999921285714286">
After three practice examples, the 38
randomised stimuli were each presented twice.
Subjects were asked to predict whether (1) the
current speaker would continue, (2) the current
speaker would continue after a short, non-
obligatory backchannel response, or (3) the
second speaker would take over.

4.3 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946580645161">
The results for this experiment are given in
Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 gives the frequency of
responses per condition, and Table 2 shows
whether the differences in number of turn-
keeping responses between the contour types are
significant. Note that in the latter table we
conflate the responses ‘hold’ and backchannel’,
since, despite subtle pragmatic differences, we
judged the prediction of a backchannel to entail
the prediction of a turn continuation (cf. Koiso et
al.). A hierarchical loglinear analysis performed
on the factors response type, contour type and
syntactic completion shows significant
associations between response type and contour
type (partial 2=288.3, p&lt;.0001), between
syntactic completion and response type (partial
2=288.3, p&lt;.0001), and interaction between the
three factors (Pearson 2=507.4, p&lt;.0001). This
means that there are main effects as well as
interaction effects of contour type and
grammatical completion on the responses.
Table 1 shows that subjects virtually never
expect a turn change when the fragment is
syntactically incomplete (2%). The only
significant differences in the number of expected
turn-keepings (‘backchannel’ plus ‘hold’) are
found between contours H*L L% and H*L H%
and between H*L L% and H*L %, but these
effects are rather small (see Table 2). The main
difference appears to be the degree to which
contours invite a backchannel response. This

tendency is weak for both the fall (H*L L%) and
the truncated fall (H*L %), but nearly half of the
H*L H% contours in syntactically incomplete
positions are judged to invite backchannel
feedback.
The syntactically complete utterances, on the
other hand, show a clear effect of contour type: a
rising pitch accent followed by a level boundary
tone (H* %) leads to 89% expected ‘hold’
responses, supporting the hypothesis that this
melodic configuration functions as a turn-
keeping device. In this respect it differs strongly
from all other contours, as is evident from the
data presented in Table 2.
The results for the syntactically complete H*
H% stimuli reflect the utterance type, and should
therefore be treated with caution. Not
surprisingly, the two interrogatives attracted
almost exclusively the judgement &apos;change&apos;; the
remaining two declaratives attracted almost
exclusively the judgement &apos;backchannel&apos;. The
use of a high rise on declaratives is a recent and
highly marked innovation in British English, and
is assumed to have the function of eliciting
hearer acknowledgment. Our results are
consistent with this view.
As Table 2 shows, there was an interesting
and significant difference between the effect of
the complete fall (H*L L%) and the truncated
fall (H*L %). The truncated fall is much more
likely to cue a turn hold (71% of responses
compared with 41% for the complete fall) and
correspondingly less likely to cue a turn change
(29% compared with 59% for the complete fall).

contour, a speaker change at a syntactically
incomplete point was hard to find in our data,
and a number of these stimuli were created
artificially by editing out intervening material.
The results of this experiment suggest that, in
this variety of English, incomplete syntax
overrides any melodic cues. Only the high level
tone appears to be a strong turn keeping device,
regardless of syntax. On the other hand there
appear to be no melodic contours which, when
they occur in conjunction with syntactic
completeness, can be said to predict a turn
change. We thus find more evidence for the use
of melody as a turn keeping device than as a turn
ceding device. The second experiment was
designed to investigate the degree to which such
judgements of speaker intention were upheld in
the presence of an actual speaker response.

his or her turn after a high level contour (there
are only 8% expected changes after H* %), and
Table 4 shows large differences between this
contour type and all others. In contrast with the
first experiment, however, there is a clear
influence of contour type on the responses in the
minus syntactic completion condition: in almost
a third of the cases subjects feel that the original
speaker had expected the turn to change after a
default pitch accent (H*L) followed by a low
(L%) or high (H%) boundary tone, that is, after a
complete fall or after a fall-rise, and Table 4
shows that these two contour types differ
significantly from all others (except from each
other). The similarity between the complete fall
and the fall-rise, which is also evident in the
syntactic completion condition, suggests that
both contours are perceived to have a similar
function with respect to turn-taking and to be at
least strong secondary cues to turn completion.
In cases where there is a clear mismatch
between syntax and contour (i.e. melodic
completion but no syntactic completion) the
actual presence of a speaker change makes
subjects more likely to judge that this was the
intention of the first speaker than they were in
the first experiment, where they did not know
what happened next.
Although subjects were simply asked to
judge what they thought the first speaker had
intended, their judgements were probably to
some extent based on a post hoc analysis of the
whole exchange. It is a general principle of
pragmatics that utterances will be assumed to be
relevant unless proved otherwise, and that
conversational interaction will be assumed to be
cooperative unless proved otherwise. There is
therefore a strong likelihood that subjects
subconsciously sought a cooperative explanation
for actual turn changes wherever possible.

6 General Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991708333333">
The major finding of this study, especially of the
first part, is that if an isolated utterance is
syntactically incomplete, listeners are highly
unlikely to predict a turn change, whatever the
melodic contour used. Where the syntax is
complete, none of the contours lead listeners to
predict exclusively a turn change. This means
that both hold and change are possible at this
point. There is one exception, namely where the
accompanying contour is a high level tone (H*
%). This contour in English appears to signal a
clear turn hold, regardless of syntax.
We were also able to make some cross-
linguistic comparisons. First, the similarities: it
appears that in both Southern British English
and Dutch the H* % contour signals the
speaker’s intention to keep the turn. This effect
cannot be attributed to the absence of a ’real’
boundary tone, since the truncated fall, which
also ends in a %, does not behave as a cue to
turn-keeping.
We also observed two main differences
between the languages. The first concerns the
occurrence of high rise tones (H* H%): we had
difficulty in finding any of these in the English
data but not in the Dutch, which may indicate a
general difference in contour distribution, or a
difference in contour function in the two
languages. This is an interesting question to pose
in a larger-scale, corpus-based study.
The second difference relates to our
observation that some contours are more likely
than others to suggest a subsequent backchannel
response. This has important implications for the
study of cooperation in interaction, both within
and between languages (cf. Wichmann 2000).
The number of ’backchannel’ judgements given
as responses to the stimuli ending in a high level
tone H* % differs between Dutch and English:
Caspers (2001) reports that in the Dutch study
56% of these contours suggest a backchannel
response, compared to only 6% in the English
study. This difference may have consequences
for cross-cultural communication: if types of
conversational behaviour are ’appropriate’ in one
language but not in the other there is potential
for cross-cultural misunderstandings which may
be perceived as ’attitudinal’.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987909090909">
The results of this study of English turn-taking
support the Dutch findings of Caspers (2001),
suggesting that while there are no melodic
contours which reliably predict a turn change,
the high level contour (H* %) creates the strong
percept in both languages of a turn continuation,
regardless of whether the utterance is
syntactically complete or not. Other contours
appear to operate at most as secondary cues to
turn-taking, with syntactic completion or non-
completion having the stronger effect.
A further observation - that some contours
are more amenable to a backchannel response
than others - suggests differences between the
two languages which may have important cross-
cultural implications.
While the answers to some of these questions
may more suitably be sought using other
methods, notably corpus-based analysis, we
consider that such approaches are
complementary to the perceptual evidence
reported here.

This is an interesting question to pose in a larger-scale, corpus-based study. The second difference relates to our observation that some contours are more likely than others to suggest a subsequent backchannel response. This has important implications for the study of cooperation in interaction, both within and between languages (cf. Wichmann 2000). The number of ’backchannel’ judgements given as responses to the stimuli ending in a high level tone H* % differs between Dutch and English: Caspers (2001) reports that in the Dutch study 56% of these contours suggest a backchannel response, compared to only 6% in the English study. This difference may have consequences for cross-cultural communication: if types of conversational behaviour are ’appropriate’ in one language but not in the other there is potential for cross-cultural misunderstandings which may be perceived as ’attitudinal’. 7 Conclusion The results of this study of English turn-taking support the Dutch findings of Caspers (2001), suggesting that while there are no melodic contours which reliably predict a turn change, the high lev</context>

Secondly, the text before each IPU boundary was judged for syntactic completion. If the utterance was at least potentially complete at that point the boundary was categorised as syntactically complete, otherwise as ’not complete’. Finally, we selected a set of IPUs according to their final contour, identified in terms of the British system of ’nuclear tones’ (fall, rise etc.) and in autosegmental-metrical terms of final pitch accent and subsequent boundary tone. (Following Gussenhoven et al. (1999) we included the possibility of a boundary tone that was neither low nor high, transcribed as %.) We identified IPUs ending in one of the following contours: a high rise (H* H%), a high level (H* %), a fall-rise (H*L H%), a fall (H*L L%) and a truncated fall (H*L %). 3 Method In the first experiment, subjects were presented with a dialogue fragment ending at an IPU boundary. The subjects’ task was to predict what happens next, i.e. whether the speaker holds the turn, or holds after a brief backchannel response, or cedes the turn.
