This paper describes the design and implementa-
tion of a lexicon of Dutch multiword expressions
(MWEs). MWEs are known to be problematic for
natural language processing. A considerable amount
of research has been conducted in this area. Most
progress has been made especially in the field of
multiword identification (Villada Moir´on and Tiede-
mann, 2006; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Zhang
et al., 2006). Moreover, interesting papers have
been written on the representation of MWEs, most
of them focusing on a single class of MWEs, see
section 2. This paper elaborates on a standard
lexical representation for Dutch MWEs developed
within the STEVIN IRME project.1 Part of the
project focused on the design and implementation
of an electronic resource of 5,000 Dutch expressions
that meets the criterion of being highly theory- and
implementation-independent, and which can be used
in various Dutch NLP systems. The selection of the
lexical entries and their properties is corpus-based.
Work has been conducted on collecting Dutch
MWEs in the past, yielding one commercial printed
dictionary (de Groot, 1999), and an electronic
resource called the Referentiebestand Nederlands
(‘Reference Database of The Dutch Language’)
(Martin and Maks, 2005), both mainly meant for
human users. No focus had been put on creating
a standard representation for Dutch MWEs that can
be converted into any system specific representation.
The approach taken is innovative, since it is based
on the Equivalence Class Method (ECM) (Odijk,
2004b). The idea behind the ECM is that MWEs
that have the same pattern require the same treat-
ment in an NLP system. MWEs with the same
pattern form so-called Equivalence Classes (ECs).
Having the ECs, it requires some manual work to
convert one instance of an EC into a system specific
representation, but all other members of the same
EC can be done in a fully automatic manner. This
method is really powerful since very detailed pattern
descriptions can be used for describing the charac-
teristics of a group of MWEs. Besides the descrip-
tion of the MWE patterns, we designed a uniform
representation for the description of the individual
expressions. Both the pattern descriptions and the
MWE descriptions are implemented in the Lexicon

of Dutch MWEs.
The purpose of this paper is to give an overview
of the decisions made in order to come to a standard
lexical representation and furthermore to discuss the
description fields that are part of this representation.
The paper starts with an overview of related re-
search in section 2. This is followed by elaborating
the Lexicon of Dutch MWEs in section 3, a discus-
sion in section 4, and a conclusion in section 5.

The area of multiword expressions includes many
different subtypes, varying from fixed expressions
to syntactically more flexible expressions. Sag et al.
(2001) wrote a well-known paper on subclasses of
MWEs, in which they make a distinction between
lexicalized phrases and institutionalized phrases.
Lexicalized phrases are subdivided into fixed, semi-
fixed and flexible expressions. The most important
reason for this subdivision is the variation in the de-
gree of syntactic flexibility of MWEs. Roughly they
claim that syntactic flexibility is related to semantic
decomposability. Semantically non-decomposable
idioms are idioms the meaning of which cannot
be distributed over its parts and which are there-
fore not subject to syntactic variability. Sag et al.
state that “the only types of lexical variation ob-
servable in non-decomposable idioms are inflection
(kicked the bucket) and variation in reflexive form
(wet oneself).” Examples of non-decomposable id-
ioms are the oft-cited kick the bucket and shoot the
breeze. On the contrary, semantically decomposable
idioms, such as spill the beans, tend to be syntacti-
cally flexible to some degree. Mapping the bound-
aries of flexibility, however, is not always easy and
no one can predict exactly which types of syntactic
variation a given idiom can undergo.
One subtype of flexible expressions discussed in
Sag et al. (2001) is the type of Light Verb Con-
structions (or Support Verb Constructions (SVCs)).
SVCs are combinations of a verb that seems to
have very little semantic content and a prepositional
phrase, a noun phrase or adjectival phrase. An SVC
is often paraphrasable by means of a single verb or
adjective. Since the complement of the verb is used
in its normal sense, the constructions are subject to
standard grammar rules, which include passiviza-
tion, internal modification, etc. The lexical selection
of the verb is highly restricted. Examples of SVCs
are give/*make a demo, make/*do a mistake.
As stated, no exhaustive research on a standard
representation of MWEs has been done for Dutch
before. Work on this topic has been conducted
for other languages, which in most cases focused
on a single subtype. Both Dormeyer and Fischer
(1998) and Fellbaum et al. (2006) report on work
on a resource for German verbal idioms, while the
representation of German PP-verb collocations is
addressed in (Krenn, 2000). Kuiper et al. (2003)
worked on a representation of English idioms, and
Villavicencio et al. (2004) proposed a lexical encod-
ing of MWEs in general, by analysing English id-
ioms and verb-partical constructions. Except for the
SAID-database (Kuiper et al., 2003), which com-
prises over 13,000 expression, the created resources
contain no more than 1,000 high-frequent expres-
sions. Both Fellbaum et al. and Krenn support their
lexical annotation with a corpus-based investigation.
In our approach, we also use data extracted from cor-
pora as empirical material, see section 3.2.
In most resources addressed, some kind of syn-
tactic analysis is assigned to individual expressions.
The most sophisticated syntactic analysis is done
in the SAID-database. The approach taken by
Kuiper et al. (2003) would have been more theory-
independent, if it included a textual description, ac-
cording to which classes of idioms could be formed.
Villavicencio et al. (2004) defined a specific meta-
type for each particular class of MWEs. The meta-
types can be used to map the semantic relations be-
tween the components of an MWE into grammar
specific features. Examples of meta-types specified
are verb-object-idiom and verb-particle-np. They
state that the majority of the MWEs in their database
could be described by the meta-types defined. But
since only a sample of 125 verbal idioms was used
for the classification, no estimation can be given of
how many classes this approach yields, when con-
sulting a larger set of various types of MWEs. Fell-
baum et al. (2006) provide a dependency structure
for each expression, but not with the intention of
grouping the entries accordingly.
To conclude this section, although our approach is
in line with some of the projects described, our work

is also distinctive because (1) it focuses on Dutch;
(2) it does not solely focus on one type of MWEs,
but on MWEs in general; (3) the lexicon includes
5,000 unique expressions, and (4) for an initial ver-
sion of the lexicon a conversion to the Dutch NLP
system Alpino2 has been tested. In the remainder
of this paper we discuss our approach to the lexical
representation of MWEs.

3 A Lexicon of Dutch MWEs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820222222222">
In our research multiword expressions are defined as
a combination of words that has linguistic properties
not predictable from the individual components or
the normal way they are combined (Odijk, 2004a).
The linguistic properties can be of any type, e.g. in
line is an MWE according to its syntactic character-
istics, since it lacks a determiner preceding the sin-
gular count noun line, which is obligatory in stan-
dard English grammar.
Various aspects played a role in the representa-
tion as it is in the Lexicon of Dutch MWEs. First of
all, the main requirement of the standard encoding
is that it can be converted into any system specific
representation with a minimal amount of manual
work. The method adopted to achieve this goal is the
Equivalence Class Method (ECM) (Odijk, 2004b).
As stated, the ECM is based on the idea that given
a class of MWE descriptions, representations for a
specific theory and implementation can be derived.
The procedure is that one instance of an Equivalence
Class (EC) must be converted manually. By defin-
ing and formalizing the conversion procedure, the
other instances of the same EC can be converted in a
fully automatic manner. In other words, having the
ECs consisting of MWEs with the same pattern, it
requires some manual work to convert one instance
of each EC into a system specific representation, but
all other members of the same EC can be done fully
automatically. In the current approach, a formal rep-
resentation of the patterns has been added to the pat-
tern descriptions. Since this formal representation
is in agreement with a de facto standard for Dutch
(van Noord et al., 2006), most Dutch NLP systems
are able to use it for the conversion procedure, yield-
ing an optimal reduction of manual labor.
The creation of MWE descriptions is a very time-

<bodyText confidence="0.9998455">
consuming task and of course we aim at an error-
free result. Accordingly, we decided to describe the
minimal ingredients of an MWE that are needed for
successful incorporation in any Dutch NLP system.
For the development of the representation two Dutch
parsers are consulted, viz. the Alpino parser and the
Rosetta MT system (Rosetta, 1994).
Another requirement of the lexicon structure is
that the information needed for the representation
is extractable from corpora, since we want to avoid
analyses entirely based on speaker-specific intu-
itions.

3.1 Subclasses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998824">
Each MWE in the lexicon is classified as either
fixed, semi-flexible or flexible. In general, our clas-
sification conforms to the categorization given in
Sag et al. (2001), any differences are explicitly dis-
cussed below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.866696">
3.1.1 Fixed MWEs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952875">
Fixed MWEs always occur in the same word
order and there is no variation in lexical item
choice. Fixed MWEs cannot undergo morpho-
syntactic variation and are contiguous, i.e. no other
elements can intervene between the words that are
part of the fixed MWE. Examples of Dutch fixed
MWEs are: ad hoc, ter plaatse ‘on the spot’, van
hoger hand ‘from higher authority’.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.842858">
3.1.2 Semi-flexible MWEs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99833">
The following characteristics are applicable to the
class of semi-flexible MWEs in our lexicon:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8099926">
1. The lexical item selection of the elements of the
expression is fixed or very limited.
2. The expression can only be modified as a
whole.3
3. The individual components can inflect, unless
explicitly marked otherwise with a parameter.
Examples of Dutch semi-flexible MWEs are: de
plaat poetsen (lit. ‘to polish the plate’, id. ‘to clear
off’), witte wijn ‘white wine’, bijvoeglijk naam-
woord ‘adjective’.

ifiers, such a proverbial in he kicked the proverbial bucket, may
intrude in these semi-flexible expressions.

<bodyText confidence="0.999737076923077">
The characteristics of this class differ on one point
from the characteristics of the semi-fixed class dis-
cussed in Sag et al. (2001), viz. on the fact that ac-
cording to Sag et al. semi-fixed expressions are not
subject to syntactic variability and the only types of
lexical variation are inflection and variation in the
reflexive form. This degree of fixedness does not
apply to our class of semi-flexible MWEs, i.e. in
Dutch (and also in other Germanic languages like
German), operations that involve movement of the
verb such as verb second, verb first and verb raising,
see (1)-(3), are also applicable to the class of semi-
flexible expressions (Schenk, 1994).

3.1.3 Flexible MWEs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990352588235294">
The main characteristic of flexible MWEs is the
fact that, contrary to semi-flexible MWEs, the in-
dividual components within flexible MWEs can be
modified. This contrast accounts for differences
between de plaat poetsen versus een bok schieten
(lit. ‘to shoot a male-goat’, id. ‘ to make a blun-
der’) and blunder maken/begaan (‘ to make a blun-
der’). Although both een bok schieten and blunder
maken/begaan are flexible MWEs, there is a differ-
ence between the two expressions. According to the
classification proposed by Sag et al. (2001), een bok
schieten is a decomposable idiom, of which the in-
dividual components cannot occur independently in
their idiomatic meaning and een blunder maken is a
support verb construction. We also want to use this
classification, and represent these expressions as fol-
lows:

<listItem confidence="0.966599625">
1. Expressions of which one part is lexically fixed
and the other part is selected from a list of one
or more co-occuring lexemes. Dutch examples
are: scherpe/stevige kritiek (‘severe criticism’),
blunder maken/begaan.
2. Expressions of which the lexical realization of
each component consists of exactly one lex-
eme. A Dutch example is een bok schieten.

The difference between the two subtypes is made
visible in the representation of the MWE and the

3.2 The data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998057857142857">
We use data extracted from the Twente Nieuws Cor-
pus (TwNC) (Ordelman, 2002) as empirical mate-
rial.4 This corpus comprises a 500 million words of
newspaper text and television news reports. From
the TwNC, a list of candidate expressions is ex-
tracted, including for each expression the following
properties:

<listItem confidence="0.964639642857143">
• the pattern assigned to the expression by the
Alpino parser
• the frequency
• the head of the expression

ment: its head, the head of the complement of
the head (in the case of PP complements), its
dependency label assigned by Alpino, the num-
ber of the noun, whether the noun is positive of
diminutive, the ten most occurring determiners,
the ten most occurring premodifiers, and the ten
most occurring postmodifiers.
• six examples sentences

The use of corpora is necessary but not suffi-
cient. It is necessary because we want our lexicon
to reflect actual language usage and because we do
not want to restrict ourselves to a linguist’s imag-
ination of which uses are possible or actually oc-
cur. On the other hand, using the corpora to ex-
tract the MWEs is not sufficient for the following
reasons: (1) text corpora may contain erroneous us-
age, and the technique used cannot distinguish this
from correct usage; (2) the extraction is in part based
on an automatic syntactic parse of the corpus sen-
tences, and these parses may be incorrect; (3) the

3.3 The lexical represention
3.3.1 Pattern description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998360923076923">
In the Lexicon of Dutch MWEs, expressions are
classified according to their pattern. In the origi-
nal ECM the pattern is an identifier which refers to
the structure of the idiom represented as free text
in which the uniqueness of the pattern is described.
This description includes the syntactic category of
the head of the expression, the complements it takes
and the description of the internal structure of the
complements. Furthermore it is described whether
individual components can be modified. In the cur-
rent approach the description of the pattern contains
besides a textual description also a formal notation,
see (4).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7205435">
(4) Expressions headed by a verb, taking a fixed
direct object constisting of a determiner and
a noun – [.VP [.obj1:NP [.det:D (1) ] [.hd:N
(2) ]] [.hd:V (3) ]]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997939">
The notation used to describe the patterns is a for-
malization of dependency trees, in particular CGN
(Corpus Gesproken Nederlands ‘Corpus of Spoken
Dutch’) dependency trees (Hoekstra et al., 2003).
CGN dependency structures are based on traditional
syntactic analysis described in the Algemene Neder-
landse Spraakkunst (Haeseryn et al., 1997) and are
aimed to be as theory neutral as possible.
The patterns are encoded using a formal language,
which is short and which allows easy visualization
of dependency trees. The dependency labels (in
lower case) and category labels (in upper case) are
divided by a colon (:), e.g. obj1:NP. For leaf nodes,
the part-of-speech is represented instead of the cate-
gory label. Leaf nodes are followed by an index that
refers to the MWE component as represented in the
CL-field (see section 3.3.2), e.g. (1) refers to the first
component of the CL, (2) to the second, etc.
A fixed expression can be represented in two ways
depending on its internal structure:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992668875">
1. For fixed expressions that are difficult to as-
sign an internal structure, we introduced a la-
bel fixed. The pattern for expressions such as
ad hoc and ter plaatste is [.:Adv fixed(1 2) ]
2. Fixed expressions with an analyzable internal
structure are represented according to the nor-
mal pattern description rules:
(5) de volle buit (‘everything’)
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.709206">
[.NP [.det:D (1) ] [.mod:A (2) ] [.hd:N (3) ]]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855111111111">
Semi-flexible MWEs are also represented accord-
ing to normal pattern description rules. To make a
distinction between (1) an NP of which all elements
are fixed, and (2) an NP of which some elements
are lexically fixed, but which is still subject to stan-
dard grammar rules, a new syntactic category N1 has
been introduced. N1 indicates that the expression
can be modified as a whole and can take a deter-
miner as specifier:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.708752">
(6) witte wijn
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.913302">
[.N1 [.mod:A (1) ] [.hd:N (2) ]]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945">
The pattern of flexible expressions of which the
lexical realization of each component consists of ex-
actly one lexeme is encoded using the syntactic cat-
egory N1. We can use the same category as in (6),
since what we want to describe is the fact that the
components in the NP are fixed, but can be modified
as a whole and can take a determiner as specifier.

Expressions of which one part is fixed and the
other part is selected from a list of one or more co-
occuring lexemes are represented with a so-called
LIST-index in the pattern. The fixed part of the ex-
pression has its literal sense. The combination of
the literal part with other lexemes is not predicable
from the meaning of the combining lexeme. Since
the meaning of an MWE or its parts is not included
in the representation, we can list every single com-
ponent with which the fixed part can combine in the
same MWE entry. For this list of components we
created a LISTA-field and LISTB-field in the MWE
description. Lists and variables are represented sim-
ilar to MWE components, attached to the leaf node,
in lower case and between (), e.g. [.hd:X (list) ],
[obj1:NP (var) ], [obj2:NP (var) ], etc.:

Our characterization of the classes of MWEs and
the formal notation of the patterns do not fully cover
the range of different types of MWEs that are de-
scribed in the lexicon. The strength of the ECM is,
however, that any expression can be included in the
lexicon, regardless of whether it fits our classifica-
tion, because of the textual description that can be
assigned. Expressions that cannot be assigned a de-
pendency structure, because of the limitations of the
notation, are classified according to the textual de-
scription of its pattern. A revision of the formal no-
tation might be done in the future.
The pattern is part of the MWE pattern descrip-
tion which includes, besides a pattern name, a pat-
tern and a textual description, five additional fields,
which are both maintenance field and fields needed
for a successful implementation of the standard rep-
resentation into a system specific representation.
Examples of MWE pattern descriptions stored in the
Lexicon of Dutch MWEs are given in Table 1.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.91666">
3.3.2 MWE description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99979303125">
In addition to the MWE pattern descriptions, the
lexicon contains MWE descriptions, see Table 2 for
a list of examples. An MWE description comprises
8 description fields. The PATTERN NAME is used
to assign an MWE pattern description to the expres-
sion. The EXPRESSION-field contains the obligatory
fixed components of an MWE in the full form.
The Component List (CL) contains the same com-
ponents as the EXPRESSION-field. The difference is
that the components in the CL are in the canonical
(or non-inflected) form, instead of in the full form.
Parameters are used to specify the full form char-
acteristics of each component. The term parame-
ter is a feature and can be defined as an occurrence
of the pair &lt;parameter category,parameter value&gt;,
where parameter category refers to the aspect we
parameterize, and parameter value to the value a pa-
rameter category takes. Examples of parameters are
&lt;nnum,sg&gt; for singular nouns, &lt;afrm,sup&gt; for su-
perlative adjectives, &lt;vfrm,part&gt; for particle verbs
(Gr´egoire, 2006). Parameter values are realized be-
tween square brackets directly on the right of the
item they parameterize.
The LISTA-field and LISTB-field are used to store
components that can be substituted for the LIST-
index in the pattern, yielding one or more expres-
sions. The reason for using two LIST-fields is to
separate predefined list values from special list val-
ues. The predefined list values are high frequent
verbs that are known to occur often as so-called light
verbs, especially with PPs. Two sets of verbs are
predefined:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.985277285714286">
1. blijken (‘appear’) blijven (‘remain’) gaan
(‘go’) komen (‘come’) lijken (‘appear’) raken
(‘get’) schijnen (‘seem’) vallen (‘be’) worden
(‘become’) zijn (‘be’)
2. brengen (‘bring’) doen (‘do’) geven (‘give’)
hebben (‘have’) houden (‘keep’) krijgen (‘get’)
maken (‘make’) zetten (‘put’)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965727272727">
A complement co-occurs either with verbs from
set 1 or with verbs from set 2. Each verb from the
chosen set is checked against the occurrences found
in the corpus data. If a verb does not occur in the
corpus data and also not in self-constructed data,
it is deleted from the LISTA-field. The LISTB-field
contains lexemes that are not in the predefined set
but do co-occur with the component(s) in the EX-
PRESSION-field. The information in the LISTB-field
is merely based on corpus data and therefore may
not be exhaustive.
The EXAMPLE-field contains an example sen-
tence with the expression. The only requirement of
this field is that its structure is identical for each ex-
pression with the same PATTERN NAME. The PO-
LARITY-field is none by default and takes the value
NPI if an expression can only occur in negative en-
vironments, and PPI if an expression can only occur
in positive environments. Finally, the MWE descrip-
tion contains a field with a reference to a plain text

fields this representation comprises. Contrary to re-
lated work, we did not solely focus on one type of
MWEs, but on MWEs in general. The Lexicon of
Dutch MWEs includes 5,000 unique expressions and
for an initial version a conversion to the Dutch NLP
system Alpino has been tested. The strength of our
method lies in the ability of grouping individual ex-
pressions according to their pattern, yielding mul-
tiple classes of MWEs. The advantage of creating
classes of MWEs is that it eases the conversion of
the standard representation into any system specific
representation.
Describing a class of MWEs using free text is
already very useful in its current form. To help
speeding up the process of converting the standard
representation into a system specific representation,
we introduced a formal notation using dependency
structures, which are aimed to be as theory neutral as
possible. However, our current notation is unable to
cover all the patterns described in the lexicon. The
notation can be extended, but we must make sure
that it does not become too ad hoc and more compli-
cated than interpreting free text.
We have created a resource that is suited for a
wide variety of MWEs. The resource describes a set
of essential properties for each MWE and classifies
each expression as either fixed, semi-flexible or flex-
ible. The set of properties can surely be extended,
but we have limited ourselves to a number of core
properties because of resource limitations. We are
confident that this resource can form a good basis
for an even more complete description of MWEs.

This paper described the design and implementa-

No exhaustive research on a standard representation

extracted form large Dutch text corpora were used
as empirical material. The approach taken is inno-
vative, since it is based on the Equivalence Class
Method (ECM). The ECM focuses on describing
MWEs according to their pattern, making it possible
to form classes of MWEs that require the same treat-

The metatypes can be used to map the semantic relations between the components of an MWE into grammar specific features. Examples of meta-types specified are verb-object-idiom and verb-particle-np. They state that the majority of the MWEs in their database could be described by the meta-types defined. But since only a sample of 125 verbal idioms was used for the classification, no estimation can be given of how many classes this approach yields, when consulting a larger set of various types of MWEs. Fellbaum et al. (2006) provide a dependency structure for each expression, but not with the intention of grouping the entries accordingly.

The dependency labels (in lower case) and category labels (in upper case) are divided by a colon (:), e.g. obj1:NP. For leaf nodes, the part-of-speech is represented instead of the category label.

MWEs are known to be problematic for natural language processing. A considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area. Most progress has been made especially in the field of multiword identification (Villada Moir´on and Tiedemann, 2006; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Zhang et al., 2006). Moreover, interesting papers have been written on the representation of MWEs, most of them focusing on a single class of MWEs, see section 2. This paper elaborates on a standard lexical representation for Dutch MWEs developed within the STEVIN IRME project.1 Part of the project focused on the design and implementation of an electronic resource of 5,000 Dutch expressions that meets the criterion of being highly theory- and implementation-independent, and which can be used in various Dutch NLP systems.

The linguistic properties can be of any type, e.g. in line is an MWE according to its syntactic characteristics, since it lacks a determiner preceding the singular count noun line, which is obligatory in standard English grammar. Various aspects played a role in the representation as it is in the Lexicon of Dutch MWEs. First of all, the main requirement of the standard encoding is that it can be converted into any system specific representation with a minimal amount of manual work. The method adopted to achieve this goal is the Equivalence Class Method (ECM) (Odijk, 2004b). As stated, the </context>

<context position="2382" citStr="Odijk, 2004" startWordPosition="366" endWordPosition="367"> The selection of the lexical entries and their properties is corpus-based. Work has been conducted on collecting Dutch MWEs in the past, yielding one commercial printed dictionary (de Groot, 1999), and an electronic resource called the Referentiebestand Nederlands (‘Reference Database of The Dutch Language’) (Martin and Maks, 2005), both mainly meant for human users. No focus had been put on creating a standard representation for Dutch MWEs that can be converted into any system specific representation. The approach taken is innovative, since it is based on the Equivalence Class Method (ECM) (Odijk, 2004b). The idea behind the ECM is that MWEs that have the same pattern require the same treatment in an NLP system. MWEs with the same pattern form so-called Equivalence Classes (ECs). Having the ECs, it requires some manual work to convert one instance of an EC into a system specific representation, but all other members of the same EC can be done in a fully automatic manner. This method is really powerful since very detailed pattern descriptions can be used for describing the characteristics of a group of MWEs. Besides the description of the MWE patterns, we designed a uniform representation fo</context>

In the remainder of this paper we discuss our approach to the lexical representation of MWEs. 3 A Lexicon of Dutch MWEs In our research multiword expressions are defined as a combination of words that has linguistic properties not predictable from the individual components or the normal way they are combined (Odijk, 2004a). The linguistic properties can be of any type, e.g. in line is an MWE according to its syntactic characteristics, since it lacks a determiner preceding the singular count noun line, which is obligatory in standard English grammar. Various aspects played a role in the representation as it is in the Lexicon of Dutch MWEs. First of all, the main requirement of the standard encoding is that it can be converted into any system specific representation with a minimal amount of manual work. The method adopted to achieve this goal is the Equivalence Class Method (ECM) (Odijk, 2004b). As stated, the </context>

Expressions of which one part is lexically fixed and the other part is selected from a list of one or more co-occuring lexemes. Dutch examples are: scherpe/stevige kritiek (‘severe criticism’), blunder maken/begaan. 2. Expressions of which the lexical realization of each component consists of exactly one lexeme. A Dutch example is een bok schieten. The difference between the two subtypes is made visible in the representation of the MWE and the MWE pattern. 3.2 The data We use data extracted from the Twente Nieuws Corpus (TwNC) (Ordelman, 2002) as empirical material.4 This corpus comprises a 500 million words of newspaper text and television news reports. From the TwNC, a list of candidate expressions is extracted, including for each expression the following properties: • the pattern assigned to the expression by the Alpino parser • the frequency • the head of the expression • the ten most occurring subjects • internal complements and for each complement: its head, the head of the complement of the head (in the case of PP complements), its dependency label assigned by Alpino, the number of the noun, whether the noun is positive of d</context>

<context position="3949" citStr="Sag et al. (2001)" startWordPosition="616" endWordPosition="619">e purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the decisions made in order to come to a standard lexical representation and furthermore to discuss the description fields that are part of this representation. The paper starts with an overview of related research in section 2. This is followed by elaborating the Lexicon of Dutch MWEs in section 3, a discussion in section 4, and a conclusion in section 5. 2 Related research: classes and representations The area of multiword expressions includes many different subtypes, varying from fixed expressions to syntactically more flexible expressions. Sag et al. (2001) wrote a well-known paper on subclasses of MWEs, in which they make a distinction between lexicalized phrases and institutionalized phrases. Lexicalized phrases are subdivided into fixed, semifixed and flexible expressions. The most important reason for this subdivision is the variation in the degree of syntactic flexibility of MWEs. Roughly they claim that syntactic flexibility is related to semantic decomposability. Semantically non-decomposable idioms are idioms the meaning of which cannot be distributed over its parts and which are therefore not subject to syntactic variability. Sag et al.</context>

For the development of the representation two Dutch parsers are consulted, viz. the Alpino parser and the Rosetta MT system (Rosetta, 1994). Another requirement of the lexicon structure is that the information needed for the representation is extractable from corpora, since we want to avoid analyses entirely based on speaker-specific intuitions. 3.1 Subclasses Each MWE in the lexicon is classified as either fixed, semi-flexible or flexible. In general, our classification conforms to the categorization given in Sag et al. (2001), any differences are explicitly discussed below. 3.1.1 Fixed MWEs Fixed MWEs always occur in the same word order and there is no variation in lexical item choice. Fixed MWEs cannot undergo morphosyntactic variation and are contiguous, i.e. no other elements can intervene between the words that are part of the fixed MWE. Examples of Dutch fixed MWEs are: ad hoc, ter plaatse ‘on the spot’, van hoger hand ‘from higher authority’. 3.1.2 Semi-flexible MWEs The following characteristics are applicable to the class of semi-flexible MWEs in our lexicon: 1. The lexical item selection of the elements o</context>
<context position="12161" citStr="Sag et al. (2001)" startWordPosition="1956" endWordPosition="1959">2. The expression can only be modified as a whole.3 3. The individual components can inflect, unless explicitly marked otherwise with a parameter. Examples of Dutch semi-flexible MWEs are: de plaat poetsen (lit. ‘to polish the plate’, id. ‘to clear off’), witte wijn ‘white wine’, bijvoeglijk naamwoord ‘adjective’. 3We abstract away from the reason why some external modifiers, such a proverbial in he kicked the proverbial bucket, may intrude in these semi-flexible expressions. 19 The characteristics of this class differ on one point from the characteristics of the semi-fixed class discussed in Sag et al. (2001), viz. on the fact that according to Sag et al. semi-fixed expressions are not subject to syntactic variability and the only types of lexical variation are inflection and variation in the reflexive form. This degree of fixedness does not apply to our class of semi-flexible MWEs, i.e. in Dutch (and also in other Germanic languages like German), operations that involve movement of the verb such as verb second, verb first and verb raising, see (1)-(3), are also applicable to the class of semiflexible expressions (Schenk, 1994).

<context position="13387" citStr="Sag et al. (2001)" startWordPosition="2159" endWordPosition="2162">ar off?’ poetsen. polish ‘... because he wanted to clear off’ 3.1.3 Flexible MWEs The main characteristic of flexible MWEs is the fact that, contrary to semi-flexible MWEs, the individual components within flexible MWEs can be modified. This contrast accounts for differences between de plaat poetsen versus een bok schieten (lit. ‘to shoot a male-goat’, id. ‘ to make a blunder’) and blunder maken/begaan (‘ to make a blunder’). Although both een bok schieten and blunder maken/begaan are flexible MWEs, there is a difference between the two expressions. According to the classification proposed by Sag et al. (2001), een bok schieten is a decomposable idiom, of which the individual components cannot occur independently in their idiomatic meaning and een blunder maken is a support verb construction. We also want to use this classification, and represent these expressions as follows: 1. Expressions of which one part is lexically fixed and the other part is selected from a list of one or more co-occuring lexemes. Dutch examples are: scherpe/stevige kritiek (‘severe criticism’), blunder maken/begaan. 2. Expressions of which the lexical realization of each component consists of exactly one lexeme.

Examples of SVCs are give/*make a demo, make/*do a mistake. As stated, no exhaustive research on a standard representation of MWEs has been done for Dutch before. Work on this topic has been conducted for other languages, which in most cases focused on a single subtype. Both Dormeyer and Fischer (1998) and Fellbaum et al. (2006) report on work on a resource for German verbal idioms, while the representation of German PP-verb collocations is addressed in (Krenn, 2000). Kuiper et al. (2003) worked on a representation of English idioms, and Villavicencio et al. (2004) proposed a lexical encoding of MWEs in general, by analysing English idioms and verb-partical constructions. Except for the SAID-database (Kuiper et al., 2003), which comprises over 13,000 expression, the created resources contain no more than 1,000 high-frequent expressions. Both Fellbaum et al. and Krenn support their lexical annotation with a corpus-based investigation. In our approach, we also use data extracted from corpora as empirical material, see section 3.2.

The purpose of the current paper is to give an overview of the decisions made in order to come to a standard lexical representation and to discuss the description fields this representation comprises. 1 Introduction This paper describes the design and implementation of a lexicon of Dutch multiword expressions (MWEs). MWEs are known to be problematic for natural language processing. A considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area. Most progress has been made especially in the field of multiword identification (Villada Moir´on and Tiedemann, 2006; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Zhang et al., 2006). Moreover, interesting papers have been written on the representation of MWEs, most of them focusing on a single class of MWEs, see section 2. This paper elaborates on a standard lexical representation for Dutch MWEs developed within the STEVIN IRME project.1 Part of the project focused on the design and implementation of an electronic resource of 5,000 Dutch expressions that meets the criterion of being highly theory- and implementation-independent, and which can be used in various Dutch NLP systems. The selection of the lexical entries and their properties is corpus-based. Work has been con</context>
