<bodyText confidence="0.999965304347826">
As our understanding of natural language gener-
ation has increased, a number of tasks have been
separated from realization and put together un-
der the heading &amp;quot;text planning&amp;quot;. So far, however,
no-one has enumerated the kinds of tasks a text
planner should be able to do. This paper describes
the principal lesson learned in combining a num-
ber of planning tasks in a planner-realizer: plan-
ning and realization should be interleaved, in a
limited-commitment planning paradigm, to per-
form two types of planning: prescriptive and re-
strictive. Limited-commitment planning consists
of both prescriptive (hierarchical expansion) plan-
ning and of restrictive planning (selecting from op-
tions with reference to the status of active goals).
At present, existing text planners use prescriptive
plans exclusively. However, a large class of planner
tasks, especially those concerned with the prag-
matic (non-literal) content of text such as style
and slant, is most easily performed under restric-
tive planning. The kinds of tasks suited to each
planning style are listed, and a program that uses
both styles is described.

goals are set by the user. The program consists
of over 12,000 lines of T, a dialect of LISP devel-
oped at Yale University.
PAULINE addresses simultaneously a wider
range of problems than has been tried in any sin-
gle language generation program before (with the
possible exception of Plippinger 74]). As is to
be expected, no part of PAULINE provides a sat-
isfactorily detailed solution to any problem; to a
larger or smaller degree, each of the questions it
addresses is solved by a set of simplified, somewhat
ad hoc methods. However, this is not to say that
the program does not provide some interesting in-
sights about the nature of language generation and
the way that generators of the future will have to
be structured.
One insight pertains to the problems encoun-
tered when the various tasks of generation — both
of text planning and of realization — are inter-
leaved to provide planning-on-demand rather than
strict top-down planning (which has been the ap-
proach taken so far). The planning tasks that are
best performed on demand tend to have short-
range effects on the text (compared to those best
performed in full before realization). In order
to achieve the types of communicative goals such
tasks usually serve, the planner must ensure that
they work together harmoniously so that their
effects support one another rather than conflict.
This requirement imposes constraints on the orga-
nization and architecture of a generation system.
This paper describes PAULINE&apos;s architecture,
the text planning tasks implemented, and how the
tasks are managed. Unfortunately many details
have to be left unsaid; the interested reader is re-
ferred to relevant material at appropriate points.

Depending on how the user sets the communica-

of an episode that took place at Yale University
in April 1986 (it also produces multiple versions
of episodes in two other domains; see (Hovy 86a,
86b1). In each case, PAULINE is also given a de-
scription of the hearer and the same three princi-
pal topics from a single underlying representation
network.
As a quick informal description of the episode,
PAULINE says:

The construction of such texts is beyond the
capabilities of most generators written to date.
Though many generators would be capable of
producing the individual sentences, some of the
pre-realization planning tasks have never been
attempted, and others, though studied exten-
sively (and in more detail than implemented in
PAULINE) have not been integrated into a single
planner under pragmatic control.
This paper involves the questions: what are
these planning tasks? How can they all be inte-
grated into one planner? How can extralinguistic
communicative goals be used to control the plan-
ning process? What is the nature of the relation
between text planner and text realiser?

2.1 The Trouble with Traditional
Planning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980647058824">
In the text planning that has been done, two prin-
cipal approaches were taken. With the integrated
approach, planning and generation is one contin-
uous process: the planner-realizer handles syntac-
tic constraints the same way it treats treats all
other constraints (such as focus or lack of requisite
hearer knowledge), the only difference being that
syntactic constraints tend to appear late in the
planning-realization process. Typically, the gener-
ator is written as a hierarchical expansion planner
(see [Sacerdoti 77]) — this approach is exempli-
fied by &apos;CAMP, Appelt&apos;s planner-generator ([Ap-
pelt 81, 82, 83, 851). With the separated approach,
planning takes place in its entirety before realiza-
tion starts; once planning is over, the planner is of
no further use to the realizer. This is the case in
the generation systems of [McKeown 82], [McCoy
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999688">
851, [Wisner 86, 87], [Novak 87], [Bienkowski 86],
[Paris 87], and [McDonald &amp; Pustejovsky 85].
Neither approach is satisfactory. Though con-
ceptually more attractive, the integrated ap-
proach makes the grammar unwieldy (it is spread
throughout the plan library) and is slow and
impractical — after all, the realization process
proper is not a planning task — and furthermore,
it is not clear whether one could formulate all text
planning tasks in a sufficiently homogeneous set
of terms to be handled by a single planner. (This
argument is made more fully in [Hovy 85] and [Mc-
Donald &amp; Pustejovsky 85].) On the other hand,
the separated approach typically suffers from the
stricture of a one-way narrow-bandwidth inter-
face; such a planner could never take into account
fortuitous syntactic opportunities — or even be
aware of any syntactic notion! Though the sepa-
ration permits the use of different representations
for the planning and realization tasks, this solu-
tion is hardly better: once the planning stage is
over, the realizer has no more recourse to it; if
the realizer is able to fulfill more than one plan-
ner instructions at once, or if it is unable to fulfill
an instruction, it has no way to bring about any
replanning. Therefore, in practice, separated gen-
erators perform only planning that has little or
no syntactic import — usually, the tasks of topic
choice and sentence order.
Furthermore, both these models both run
counter to human behavior: When we speak, we
do not try to satisfy only one or two goals, and we
operate (often, and with success) with conflicting
goals for which no resolution exists. We usually
begin to speak before we have planned out the full
utterance, and then proceed while performing cer-
tain planning tasks in bottom-up fashion.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9996">
2.2 A Solution: Interleaving
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982661492753623">
Taking this into account, a better solution is to
perform limited-commitment planning — to de-
fer planning until necessitated by the realization
process. The planner need assemble only a par-
tial set of generator instructions — enough for
the realization component to start working on —
and can then continue planning when the realiza-
tion component requires further guidance. This
approach interleaves planning and realization and
is characterized by a two-way communication at
the realizer&apos;s decision points. The advantages are:
First, it allows the separation of planning and re-
alization tasks, enabling them to be handled in
appropriate terms. (In fact, it even allows the
separation of special-purpose planning tasks with
idiosyncratic representational requirements to be
accommodated in special-purpose planners.) Sec-
ond, it allows planning to take into account unex-
pected syntactic opportunities and inadequacies.
Third, this approach accords well with the pay-
cholinguistic research of [Bock 87], [Rosenberg 77],
[Danks 771, [De Smedt &amp; Kempen 87], [Kempen
&amp; Hoenkamp 78], [Kempen 77, 761, and [Levelt
&amp; Schriefers 871. This is the approach taken in
PAULINE.
But there is a cost to this interleaving: the type
of planning typically activated by the realizer dif-
fers from traditional top-down planning. There
are three reasons for this. 1. Top-down planning is
prescriptive: it determines a series of actions over
an extended range of time (i.e., text). However,
when the planner cannot expand its plan to the
final level of detail — remember, it doesn&apos;t have
access to syntactic information — then it has to
complete its task by planning in-line, during real-
ization. And in-line planning usually requires only
a single decision, a selection from the syntactically
available options. After in-line planning culmi-
nates in a decision, subsequent processing contin-
ues as realization — at least until the next set of
unprovided-for options. Unfortunately, unlike hi-
erarchical plan steps, subsequent in-line planning
options need not work toward the same goal (or in-
deed have any relation with each other); the plan-
ner has no way to guess even remotely what the
next set of options and satisfiable goals might be.
2. In-line planning is different for a second rea-
son: it is impossible to formulate workable plans
for common speaker goals such as pragmatic goals.
A speaker may, for example, have the goals to im-
press the hearer, to make the hearer feel socially
subordinate, and yet to be relatively informal.
These goals play as large a role in generation as
the speaker&apos;s goal to inform the hearer about the
topic. However, they cannot be achieved by con-
structing and following a top-down plan — what
would the plan&apos;s steps prescribe? Certainly not
the sentence &amp;quot;I want to impress you, but still make
you feel subordinate&amp;quot;! Pragmatic effects are best
achieved by making appropriate subtle decisions
during the generation process: an extra adjective
here, a slanted verb there. Typically, this is a mat-
ter of in-line planning
3. A third difference from traditional plan-
ning is the following: Some goals can be achieved,
flushed from the goal list, and forgotten. Such
goals (for example, the goal to communicate a
certain set of topics) usually activate prescriptive
plans. In contrast, other goals cannot ever be
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992794">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998381">
fully achieved. If you are formal, you are formal
throughout the text; if you are friendly, arrogant,
or opinionated, you remain so — you cannot sud-
denly be &amp;quot;friendly enough&apos; and then flush that
goal. These goals, which are pragmatic and stylis-
tic in nature, are well suited to in-line planning.
Generation, then, requires two types of plan-
ning. Certain tasks are most easily performed in
top-down fashion (that is, under guidance of a hi-
erarchical planner, or of a fixed-plan (schema or
script) applier), and other tasks are most natu-
rally performed in a bottom-up, selective, fashion.
That is, some tasks are prescriptive — they act
over and give shape to long ranges of text — and
some are restrictive — they act over short ranges
of text, usually as a selection from some number
of alternatives. Prescriptive strategies are forma.
tive: they control the construction and placement
of parts in the paragraph and the sentence; that
is, they make some commitment to the final form
of the text (such as, for example, the inclusion
and order of specific sentence topics). Restrictive
strategies are selective: they decide among alter-
natives that were left open (such as, for example,
the possibility of including additional topics un-
der certain conditions, or the specific content of
each sentence). A restrictive planner cannot sim-
ply plan for, it is constrained to plan with: the
options it has to select from are presented to it by
the realizer.

2.3 Planning Restrictively: Moni-
toring
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986066666667">
Since there is no way to know which goals sub-
sequent decisions will affect, restrictive planning
must keep track of all goals — conflicting or not —
and attempt to achieve them all in parallel. Thus,
due to its bottom-up, run-time nature, planning
with restrictive strategies takes the form of execu-
tion monitoring (see, say, [Fikes, Hart &amp; Nilsson
721, [Sacerdoti 77], [Miller 851, [Doyle, Atkinson &amp;
Doshi 86], [Broverman &amp; Croft 87]); we will use
the term monitoring here, appropriate for a sys-
tem that does not take into account the world&apos;s
actual reaction (in generation, the hearer&apos;s actual
response), but that trusts, perhaps naively, that
the world will react in the way it expects. Moni-
toring requires the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.943008142857143">
• checking, updating, and recording the current
satisfaction status of each goal
• determining which goal(s) each option will
help satisfy, to what extent, in what ways
• determining which goal(s) each option will
thwart, to what extent, and in what ways
• computing the relative priority of each goal

<bodyText confidence="0.989623714285714">
in order to resolve conflicts (to decide, say,
whether during instruction to change the
topic or to wait for a socially dominant hearer
to change it)
When the planner is uncertain about which long-
term goals to pursue and which sequence of actions
to select, the following strategies are useful:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982459133333333">
• prefer common intermediate goals (subgoals
shared by various goals [Durfee &amp; Lesser 86])
• prefer cheaper goals (more easily achieved
goals; [Durfee &amp; Lesser 86])
• prefer discriminative intermediate goals
(goals that most effectively indicate the long-
term promise of the avenue being explored)
([Durfee &amp; Lesser 861)
• prefer least-satisfied goals (goals furthest
from achievement)
• prefer least-recently satisfied goals (goals least
recently advanced)
• combine the latter two strategies (a goal re-
ceives higher priority the longer it waits and
the fewer times it has been advanced)

3.1 Program Architecture, Input
and Opinions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981291666667">
The user provides PAULINE with input topics and
a set of pragmatic goals, which activate a number
of intermediate rhetorical goals that control the
style and slant of the text. Whenever planning or
realization require guidance, queries are directed
to the activated rhetorical goals and their associ-
ated strategies (see Figure 1).
Prescriptive planning is mostly performed dur-
ing topic collection and topic organization and re-
strictive planning is mostly performed during re-
alization. Restrictive planning is implemented in
PAULINE in the following way: None of the pro-
gram&apos;s rhetorical goals (opinion and style) are ever
fully achieved and flushed; they require decisions
to be made in their favor throughout the text.
PAULINE keeps track of the number of times each
such goal is satisfied by the selection of some op-
tion (of course, a single item may help satisfy a
number of goals simultaneously). For conflict reso-
lution, PAULINE uses the least-satisfied strategy:
the program chooses the option helping the goals
with the lowest total satisfaction status. In order
to do this, it must know which goals each option
will help satisfy. Responsibility for providing this

information lies with whatever produces the op-
tion: either the lexicon or the language specialist
functions in the grammar.
PAULINE&apos;s input is represented in a standard
case-frame-type language based on Conceptual
Dependency aSchank 72, 75], [Schaak &amp; Abel-
son 77]) and is embedded in a property-inheritance
network (see [Charniak, Riesbeck, &amp; McDermott
80], [Bobrow &amp; Winograd 771). The shantytown
example consists of about 120 elements. No inter-
mediate representation (say, one that varies de-
pending on the desired slant and style) is created.
PAULINE&apos;s opinions are based on the three af-
fect values GOOD, NEUTRAL, and BAD, as de-
scribed in [Hovy 86b]. Its rules for affect combina-
tion and propagation enable the program to com-
pute an opinion for any representation element.
For instance, in example 2 (where PAULINE
speaks as a protester), its sympathy list contains
the elements representing the protesters and the
protesters&apos; goal that Yale divest, and its antipathy
list contains Yale and Yale&apos;s goal that the univer-
sity remain in an orderly state.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999334">
3.2 Text Planning Tasks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999637333333333">
This section very briefly notes the text planning
tasks that PAULINE performs: topic collection,
topic interpretation, additional topic inclusion,
topic juxtaposition, topic ordering, intrasentential
slant, and intrasentential style.
Topic Collection (Prescriptive): This task
— collecting, from the input elements, additional
representation elements and determining which
aspects of them to say — is pre-eminently pre-
scriptive. Good examples of topic collection plans
(also called schemas) can be found in [McKeown
82], [Paris &amp; McKeown 87], and [Rosner 861. In
this spirit PAULINE has three plans — the DE-
SCRIBE plan to find descriptive aspects of ob-
jects, the RELATE plan to relate events and state-
changes, and the CONVINCE plan to select topics
that will help convince the hearer of some opinion.
Whenever it performs topic collection, PAULINE
applies the prescriptive steps of the appropriate
collection plan to each candidate topic, and then
in turn to the newly-found candidate topics, for
as long as its pragmatic criteria (amongst others,
the amount of time available) allow. The CON-
VINCE plan (described in [Hovy 85]) contains,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998301">
183
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.981252647058823">
amongst others, the steps to say good intentions,
say good results, and appeal to authority. Example
1 presents the topics as given; in example 2, the
CONVINCE plan prescribes the inclusion of the
protesters&apos; goal and the support given by the lo-
cal community and faculty; and in example 3, with
opposite sympathies, the same plan prescribes the
inclusion of Yale&apos;s request and of the announce-
ment of the investigation commission.
Topic Interpretation (Prescriptive and
Restrictive): As described in [Hovy 87c], gen-
erators that slavishly follow their input elements
usually produce bad text. In order to produce for-
mulations that are appropriately detailed and/or
slanted, a generator must have the ability to ag-
gregate or otherwise interpret its input elements,
either individually or in groups, as instances of
other representation elements. But finding new
interpretations can be very difficult; in general,
this task requires the generator (a) to run infer-
ences off the input elements, and (b) to determine
the expressive suitability of resulting interpreta-
tions. Though unbounded inference is not a good
idea, limited inference under generator control can
improve text significantly. One source of control
is the generator&apos;s pragmatic goals: it should try
only inferences that are likely to produce goal-
serving interpretations. In this spirit, PAULINE
has a number of prescriptive and restrictive strate-
gies that suggest specific interpretation inferences
slanted towards its sympathies. For example, in a
dispute between &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; (the program&apos;s sympathies)
and &amp;quot;they&apos;, some of its strategies call for the in-
terpretations that
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988495333333333">
• coercion: they coerce others into doing things
for them
• appropriation: they use ugly tactics, such as
taking and using what isn&apos;t &apos;theirs
• conciliation: we are conciliatory; we moderate
our demands
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997948617647059">
Interpretation occurred in examples 1 and 3: the
notions of punishment in example 1, and of appro-
priation (&amp;quot;took over Beinecke Plaza&amp;quot;) and concil-
iation (&amp;quot;Yale gave in&amp;quot;) in example 3, did not ap-
pear in the representation network.
Additional Topic Inclusion (Restrictive):
During the course of text planning, the genera-
tor may find additional candidate topics. When
such topics serve the program&apos;s goals, they can be
included in the text. But whether or not to in-
clude these instances can only be decided when
such topics are found; the relevant strategies are
therefore restrictive. For example, explicit state-
ments of opinion may be interjected where appro-
priate, such as, in example 3, the phrases &amp;quot;It pisses
me off&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I am happy that&apos;.
Topic Juxtaposition (Restrictive): By jux-
taposing sentence topics in certain ways, one can
achieve opinion-related and stylistic effects. For
example, in order to help slant the text, PAULINE
uses multi-predicate phrases to imply certain af-
fects. Two such phrases are &amp;quot;Not only X, but Y&amp;quot;
and &apos;X; however, IP; depending on the speaker&apos;s
feelings about X, these phrases attribute feelings
to Y, even though Y may really be neutral (for
more detail [Hovy 86b]). With respect to stylis-
tic effect, the juxtaposition of several topics into a
sentence usually produces more complex, formal-
sounding text. For example, consider how the
phrases &amp;quot;as a reminder&amp;quot;, &apos;also, at that time&apos;,
and &apos;concurrently&apos; are used in example 2 to link
sentences that are separate in example 3. The
task of topic juxtaposition is best implemented re-
strictively by presenting the candidate topics as
options to strategies that check the restrictions
on the use of phrases and select suitable ones.
(The equivalent prescriptive formulation amounts
to giving the program goals such as [find in the net-
work two topics that will fit into a &apos;Not only but&apos;
phrase], a much less tractable task.)
Topic Ordering (Prescriptive): The order-
ing of topics in the paragraph is best achieved
prescriptively. Different circumstances call for
different orderings; newspaper articles, for in-
stance, often contain an introductory summa-
rizing sentence. In contrast to the abovemen-
tioned schemas ((McKeown 821, etc.), steps in
PAULINE&apos;s topic collection plans are not ordered;
additional plans must be ran to ensure coher-
ent text flow. PAULINE uses one of two topic-
ordering plans which are simplified scriptifications
of the strategies discussed in [Hobbs 78, 79] and
[Mann &amp; Thompson 83, 87].
Intrasentential Slant (Restrictive): In ad-
dition to interpretation, opinion inclusion, and
topic juxtaposition, other slanting techniques in-
clude the use of stress words, adjectives, adverbs,
verbs that require idiosyncratic predicate con-
tents, nouns, etc. Due to the local nature of most
of these techniques and to the fact that options are
only found rather late in the realization process,
they are best implemented restrictively. In exam-
ple 2, for example, the protesters are described as
&amp;quot;a large number of concerned students&amp;quot;. This is
generated in the following way: The generator&apos;s
noun group specialist produces, amongst others,
the goals to say adjectives of number and of opin-
ion. Then the specialist that controls the real-

ization of adjectives of number collects all the al-
ternatives that express number attributively (such
as &amp;quot;a few&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;many&amp;quot;, a number) together with the
connotations each carries. The restrictive strate-
gies activated by the rhetorical goals of opinion
then select the options of &amp;quot;many&apos; and &amp;quot;a large
number&amp;quot; for their slanting effect. Finally, the re-
strictive strategies that serve the rhetorical goals
determining formality select the latter alternative.
The opinion &apos;concerned&apos; is realized similarly, as
are the phrases &amp;quot;as a reminder&apos; and, in example
3, &amp;quot;a few shiftless students&apos; and &apos;idiots&apos;.
Intrasentential Style (Restrictive): Con-
trol of text style is pre-eminently a restrictive
task, since syntactic alternatives usually have rel-
atively local effect. PAULINE&apos;s rhetorical goals of
style include haste, formality, detail, simplicity (see
[Hovy 87d1). Associated with each goal is a set of
restrictive strategies or plans that act as criteria
at relevant decision points in the realization pro-
cess. Consider, for example, the stylistic difference
between examples 2 and 3. The former is more for-
mal: the sentences are longer, achieved by using
conjunctions; they contain adverbial clauses, usu-
ally at the beginnings of sentences (9ater, at 5:30
am one morning&amp;quot;); adjectival descriptions are rel-
advised (&amp;quot;named Winnie Mandela City&amp;quot;); formal
nouns, verbs, and conjunctions are used (&amp;quot;erected,
requested, concurrently, permitted&amp;quot;). In contrast,
example 3 seems more colloquial because the sen-
tences are shorter and simpler; they contain fewer
adverbial clauses; and the nouns, verbs, and con-
junctions are informal (&amp;quot;built, asked, at the same
time, let&amp;quot;). Indications of the formality of phrases,
nouns, and verbs are stored in discriminations in
the lexicon (patterned after [Goldman 751).

4 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.9997958">
The choices distributed throughout the genera-
tion process are not just a set of unrelated ad
hoc decisions; they are grammatically related or,
through style and slant, convey pragmatic infor-
mation. Therefore, they require control. Since
traditional top-down prescriptive planning is un-
able to provide adequate control, a different kind
of planning is required. The limited-commitment
planning organization of PAULINE illustrates a
possible solution.
Text planning provides a wonderfully rich con-
text in which to investigate the nature of prescrip-
tive and restrictive planning and execution moni-
toring - issues that are also important to general
Al planning research.

<abstract confidence="0.999610041666667">As our understanding of natural language generation has increased, a number of tasks have been separated from realization and put together under the heading &amp;quot;text planning&amp;quot;. So far, however, no-one has enumerated the kinds of tasks a text planner should be able to do. This paper describes the principal lesson learned in combining a number of planning tasks in a planner-realizer: planning and realization should be interleaved, in a limited-commitment planning paradigm, to perform two types of planning: prescriptive and restrictive. Limited-commitment planning consists of both prescriptive (hierarchical expansion) planning and of restrictive planning (selecting from options with reference to the status of active goals). At present, existing text planners use prescriptive plans exclusively. However, a large class of planner tasks, especially those concerned with the pragmatic (non-literal) content of text such as style and slant, is most easily performed under restrictive planning. The kinds of tasks suited to each planning style are listed, and a program that uses both styles is described.</abstract>
