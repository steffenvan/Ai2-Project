As it becomes imperative for both managers and market-

for help from technical staff or programmers, natural
language front ends for database management systems
have developed to fill this need. This session describes

organized and chaired by Beatrice Oshika (Sparta Inc.)
As computer systems become increasing powerful and as
common as telephones in business operations, it becomes
increasingly important that they support the most natural
kind of user interaction, voice communication. A speech
interface is particularly valuable in an environment where
hands and eyes are busy and voice output (such as alerts
and instructions) and voice input (of commands and data
entry) offer additional communication paths. This voice
capability is now found in other contexts, such as profes-
sional workstations and telecommunications systems.
The papers in this session discuss the state of the art in
speech synthesis and recognition technology and describe
current applications, including the growing market for
voice mail.

THE CATALOGUE OF
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999670571428571">
The Catalogue of Artificial Intelligence Techniques is a
kind of mail order catalogue. Its purpose is to promote
interaction between members of the Al community. It
does this by announcing the existence of Al techniques,
and acting as a pointer into the literature. Thus the At
community will have access to a common, extensional
definition of the field, which will
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997899">
• promote a common terminology,
• discourage the reinvention of wheels, and
• act as a clearing house for ideas and algorithms.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985477500000001">
The catalogue is a reference work providing a quick
guide to the Al techniques available for different jobs. It
is not intended io be a textbook like the Artificial Intelli-
gence Handbook. It, intentionally, only provides a brief
description of each technique, with no extended
discussion of its historical origin or how it has been used
in particular Al programs.
The original version of the catalogue was hastily built
in 1983 as part of the UK SERC-DoI, IKBS, Architecture
Study. It has now been adopted by the UK Alvey
Programme and is both kept as an on-line document
undergoing constant revision and refinement, and
published as a paperback by Springer Verlag. Springer
Verlag have agreed to reprint the Catalogue at frequent
intervals in order to keep it up to date.
The on-line and paperback versions of the catalogue
meet different needs and differ in the entries they
contain. In particular, the on-line version was designed
to promote UK interaction and contains all the entries we
received that meet the criteria defined below. Details of
how to access the on-line version are available from
John Smith
Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory
Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 OQX
The paperback version was designed to serve as a refer-
ence book for the international community, and does not
contain entries of interest only in a UK context.
By &amp;quot;AI techniques&amp;quot; we mean algorithms, data (know-
ledge) formalisms, architectures, and methodological
techniques, which can be described in a precise, clean
way. The catalogue entries are intended to be non-tech-
nical and brief, but with a literature reference. The refer-
ence might not be the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; one. It will often be to a
textbook or survey article. The border between Al and
non-AI techniques is fuzzy. Since the catalogue is to
promote interaction some techniques are included
because they are vital parts of many AI programs, even
though they did not originate in Al.
We have not included in the catalogue separate entries
for each slight variation of a technique, nor have we
included descriptions of Al programs tied to a particular
application, nor of descriptions of work in progress. The
catalogue is not intended to be a dictionary of Al termi-
nology, nor to include definitions of Al problems, nor to
include descriptions of paradigm examples.
Entries are short (abstract length) descriptions of a
technique. They include: a title, list of aliases, contribu-
tor&apos;s name, paragraph of description, and references.
The contributor&apos;s name is that of the original author of
the entry. Only occasionally is the contributor of the
entry also the inventor of the technique. The reference is
a better guide to the identity of the inventor. Some
entries have been subsequently modified by the referees
and/or editorial team, and these modifications have not
always been checked with the original contributor, so
(s)he should not always be held morally responsible, and
should never be held legally responsible.
The original version of the catalogue was called The
Catalogue of Artificial Intelligence Tools and also
contained descriptions of portable software, e.g., expert
systems shells and knowledge representation systems.
Unfortunately, we found it impossible to maintain a
comprehensive coverage of either all or only the best
such software. New systems were being introduced too
frequently, and it required a major editorial job to
discover all of them, to evaluate them, and to decide
what to include. It would also have required a much
more frequent reprinting of the catalogue than either the
publishers, editors, or readers could afford. Also, expert
systems shells threatened to swamp the other entries.
We have, therefore, decided to omit software entries
from future editions and rename the catalogue to reflect
this. The only exception to this is programming
languages, for which we will provide generic entries.
Any software entries sent to us will be passed on to
Graeme Publishing Company, who publish a directory of
Al vendors and products.
If you would like to submit an entry for the catalogue,
then please send the information requested in the form
below to:

<bodyText confidence="0.991602075">
Artificial Intelligence is a field of increasing importance,
industrially, technologically, and intellectually. However,
it is not always easy to locate the descriptions of the
research and development being done world wide. Not
only is there a host of new journals appearing but also a
great part of the work is described in memoranda series
from university departments and research laboratories,
and one must subscribe to these series individually to
receive the abstracts of their papers.
An additional difficulty impeding smooth and rapid
communication of results is the fact that research work,
when published in the open literature, appears not only in
journals using phrases like Artificial Intelligence or
Machine Intelligence but also under closely related
descriptions such as Expert Systems, Knowledge Based
Systems, Logic Programming, Fifth Generation Systems,
Cybernetics, Human-Computer Interface, and Pattern
Recognition. Much original work in these fields also
appears in journals within Linguistics, Psychology, Logic,
and Philosophy.
Artificial Intelligence Abstracts will tackle these prob-
lems both for researchers in all those fields and for the
wider community that needs urgent access to this work.
It will be published six times a year by Blackwells of
Oxford and contain about 250 abstracts in each issue
(starting in January 1987). These will be in a standard
format with subject descriptors and an indexing code
with a hierarchical classification of the whole field.
Research institutions, journal editors, and individual
researchers are encouraged to send abstracts to the editor
of AIA directly:
Yorick Wilks
Box 3CRL
New Mexico State University
Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA
or, preferably, by electronic mail to
yorick @ nmsu. csnet
Submissions should contain details of where the docu-
ment abstracted may be obtained, including mailing
address of an institution, where appropriate.
