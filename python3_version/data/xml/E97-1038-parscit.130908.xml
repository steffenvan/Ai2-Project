This paper presents a new approach to bitext
correspondence problem (BCP) of noisy bilingual
corpora based on image processing (IP) techniques.
By using one of several ways of estimating the
lexical translation probability (LTP) between pairs
of source and target words, we can turn a bitext
into a discrete gray-level image. We contend that
the BCP, when seen in this light, bears a striking
resemblance to the line detection problem in IP.
Therefore, BCPs, including sentence and word
alignment, can benefit from a wealth of effective,
well established IP techniques, including
convolution-based filters, texture analysis and
Hough transform. This paper describes a new
program, PlotAlign that produces a word-level
bitext map for noisy or non-literal bitext, based on
these techniques.

<bodyText confidence="0.999947956521739">
Aligned corpora have proved very useful in many
tasks, including statistical machine translation,
bilingual lexicography (Daille, Gaussier and Lange
1993), and word sense disambiguation (Gale,
Church and Yarowslcy 1992; Chen, Ker, Sheng,
and Chang 1997). Several methods have recently
been proposed for sentence alignment of the
Hansards, an English-French corpus of Canadian
parliamentary debates (Brown, Lai and Mercer
1991; Gale and Church 1991a; Simard, Foster and
Isabelle 1992; Chen 1993), and for other language
pairs such as English-German, English-Chinese,
and English-Japanese (Church, Dagan, Gale, Fung,
Helfman and Satish 1993; Kay and Roscheisen
1993; Wu 1994).
The statistical approach to machine translation
(SMT) can be understood as a word-by-word
model consisting of two sub-models: a language
model for generating a source text segment S and a
translation model for mapping S to its translation
T. Brown et al. (1993) also recommend using a
bilingual corpus to train the parameters of Pr(S I 7),
translation probability (TP) in the translation
model. In the context of SMT, Brown et al.
(1993) present a series of five models of Pr(S I 7)
for word alignment. The authors propose using
an adaptive Expectation and Maximization (EM)
algorithm to estimate parameters for lexical
translation probability (LTP) and distortion
probability (DP), two factors in the TP, from an
aligned bitext. The EM algorithm iterates
between two phases to estimate LTP and DP until
both functions converge.
Church (1993) observes that reliably distinguishing
sentence boundaries for a noisy bitext obtained
from an OCR device is quite difficult. Dagan,
Church and Gale (1993) recommend aligning
words directly without the preprocessing phase of
sentence alignment. They propose using
char_align to produce a rough character-level
alignment first. The rough alignment provides a
basis for estimating the translation probability
based on position, as well as limits the range of
target words being considered for each source word.
Char_align (Church 1993) is based on the
observation that there are many instances of

cognates among the languages in the Indo-
European family. However, Fung and Church
(1994) point out that such a constraint does not
exist between languages across language groups
such as Chinese and English. The authors
propose a K-vec approach which is based on a k-
way partition of the bilingual corpus. Fung and
McKeown (1994) propose using a similar measure
based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) between
occurrence recency sequences to improve on the K-
vec method.
The char-align, K-vec and DTW approaches rely
on dynamic programming strategy to reach a rough
alignment. As Chen (1993) points out, dynamic
programming is particularly susceptible to
deletions occurring in one of the two languages.
Thus, dynamic programming based sentence
alignment algorithms rely on paragraph anchors
(Brown et al. 1991) or lexical information, such as
cognates (Simard 1992), to maintain a high
accuracy rate. These methods are not robust with
respect to non-literal translations and large
deletions (Simard 1996). This paper presents a
new approach based on image processing (IP)
techniques, which is immune to such predicaments.

Like the image of a natural scene, the linguistic or
statistical estimate of LTP gives rise to signal as
well as noise. These signal and noise can be
viewed as a gray-level dotplot (Church and Gale
1991), as Figure 1 shows.
We observe that the BCP, when cast as a gray-level
image, bears a striking resemblance to IP problems,
including edge detection, texture classification, and
line detection. Therefore, the BCP can benefit
from a wealth of effective, well established IP
techniques, including convolution-based filtering,

where a high LTP value is registered. The
cell with a dark dot in it is an alignment
connection.
Each of these constraints lead to a specific pattern
in the dotplot. The structure preserving constraint
means that the connections of adjacent words tend
to form short, diagonal edges on the dotplot. For
instance, Figure 2 shows that the adjacent words
such as &amp;quot;He hopes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;achieve all&amp;quot; lead to
diagonal edges, 00 and 00 in the dotplot.
However, edges with different orientation may also
appear due to some morphological constraints.
For instance, the token &amp;quot;aim&amp;quot; connects to a
Mandarin compound &amp;quot;p14,&amp;quot; thereby gives rise to
the horizontal edge 00. The one-to-one
assumption leads to a textural pattern that can be
categorized as a region of dense dots distributed
much like the l&apos;s in a permutation matrix. For
instance, the vicinity of connection dot 0 (end, At)
is denser than that of a non-connection say (end,
). Furthermore, the nearby connections 0, 0,
and 0, form a texture much like a permutation
matrix with roughly one dot per row and per
column. The non-crossing assumption means that
the connection target of a sentence will not come
before that of its preceding sentence. For instance,
Figure 1 shows that there are clearly two long lines
representing a sequence of sentences where this
constraint holds. The gap between these two lines
results from the deletion of several sentences in the
translation process.

Convolution is the method of choice for enhancing

incomplete image, as in the case of LTP dotplot, a
discrete convolution-based filter is effective in
filling a missing or under-estimated dot which is
surrounded by neighboring dots with high LTP
value according to the structure preserving con-
straint. A filtering mask stipulates the relative
location of these supporting dots. The filtering

2.4 Texture analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975225333333333">
Following the common practice in IP for texture
analysis, we propose to extract features to
discriminate a connection region in the dotplot from
non-connection regions. First, the dotplot should
be normalized and binarized, leaving the expected
number of dots, in order to reduce complexity and
simplify computation. Then, projectional
transformation to either or both axes of the
languages involved will compress the data further
without losing too much information. That
further reduces the 2D texture discrimination task
to a 1D problem. For instance, Figure 4 shows
that the vicinity of a connection (by, ) is
characterized by evenly distributed high LTP
values, while that of a non-connection is not.
According to the one-to-one constraint, we should
be looking for dense and continuous 1D occurrence
of dots. A cell with high density and high power

where w and v are the width and height of a window
for feature extraction, and c is the bound for the
resolution of texture. The bound depends on the
coverage rate of LTP estimates; 2 or 3 seems to
produce satisfactory results.
Since the one-to-one constraint is a sentence level
phenomena, the values for w and v should be
chosen to correspond to the lengths of average
sentences in each of the two languages.

The purpose of Hough transform (HT) algorithm,
in short, is to map all points of a line in the original

a point (p, 0) on the p - 0 plane describes a line on
the x-y plane. Furthermore, HT is insensitive to
perturbation in the sense the line of (p, 0) is very
close to that of (p-1-p, 0-th0). That enables
HT-based line detection algorithm to find high
resolution, one-pixel-wide lines, as well as lower-
resolution lines.

As mentioned above, many alignment algorithms
rely on anchors, such as cognates, to keep
alignment on track. However, that is only
possible for bitext of certain language pairs and
text genres. For a clean bitext, such as the
Hansards, most dynamic programming based
algorithms perform well (Simard 1996). To the
contrary, a noisy bitext with large deletions,
inversions and non-literal translations will appear
as disconnected segments on the dotplot. Gaps
between these segments may overpower dynamic
programming, and lead to a low precision rate.
Simard (1996) shows that for the Hansards corpus,
most sentence-align algorithms yield a precision
rate over 90%. For a noisy corpus, such as
literary bitext, the rate drops below 50%.
Contrary to the dynamic programming based
methods, Hough transform always detect the most
apparent line segments even in a noisy dotplot.
Before applying Hough transform, the same
processes of normalization and thresholding are
performed first. The algorithm is described as
follows:

2. For a window of n x m cells, set the t(s, t) values

3. Set incidence (p, 0) = 0, for all -k5_13.5.k, -90°
&lt; 0 &lt; 0°,
4. For each cell (x, y), t(x, y) = 1 and -90° 0 00
,
increment incidence (x cos 0 + y sin 0, 0) by 1.
5. Keep (p, 0) pairs that have high incidence value,
incidence (p, 9)&gt; X. Subsequently, filter out
dot (x, y) that does not lie on such a line, (p, 0)
or within a certain distance 8 from (p, 0).

<bodyText confidence="0.9998065">
Figure 6 shows that the coverage and precision of
the LTP estimate is not very high. That is to be
expected since the translation is not literal and the
mutual information estimate based on an outside
source might not be relevant. Nevertheless,
PlotAlign algorithms seem to be robust enough to
produce reasonably high precision that can be seen
from Figure 3. Figure 3(a) shows that a
normalization and thresholding process based on
one-to-one constraints does a good job of filtering
out noise. Figure 3(b) shows that convolution-
based filtering remove more noise according to the
assumption of structure preserving constraint.
Texture analysis does an even better job in noise
suppression. Figure 7(a) and 7(b) show that
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is greatly improved.
The filtering based on Hough Transform, contrary
to the other two filtering methods, prefers
connection that is consistent with other connections
globally. It does a pretty good job of identifying a
long line segment. However, isolated, short
segments, surrounded by deletions are likely to be
missed out. Figure 8(b) shows that filtering based
on HT missed out the short line segment appearing
near the center of the dotplot shown in Figure 6(b).
Nevertheless, this short segment presents most
vividly in the result of textural filter, shown in
Figure 7(b). By combining filters on all three
levels of resolution, we gather as much evidence as
possible for optimal result.

The algorithm&apos;s performance discussed herein can
definitely be improved by enhancing the various
components of the algorithms, e.g. introducing
bilingual dictionaries and thesauri. However, the
PlotAlign algorithms constitute a functional core
for processing noisy bitext. While the evaluation
is based on an English-Chinese bitext, the linguistic
constraints motivating the algorithms seem to be
quite general and, to a large extent, language
independent. If that is the case, the algorithms

prospects for English-Japanese or Chinese-
Japanese, in particular, seem highly promising.
Performing the alignment task as image processing
proves to be an effective approach and sheds new
light on the bitext correspondence problem. We
are currently looking at the possibilities of
exploiting powerful and well established IP
techniques to attack other problems in natural
language processing.

<abstract confidence="0.999908444444444">This paper presents a new approach to bitext correspondence problem (BCP) of noisy bilingual corpora based on image processing (IP) techniques. By using one of several ways of estimating the lexical translation probability (LTP) between pairs of source and target words, we can turn a bitext into a discrete gray-level image. We contend that the BCP, when seen in this light, bears a striking resemblance to the line detection problem in IP. Therefore, BCPs, including sentence and word alignment, can benefit from a wealth of effective, well established IP techniques, including convolution-based filters, texture analysis and Hough transform. This paper describes a new produces a word-level bitext map for noisy or non-literal bitext, based on these techniques.</abstract>
