This book is an elementary introduction to natural language processing, but it is a very
unusual one for two reasons. First, its subject languages are those of India; second,
although the book sets out and discusses the better-known linguistic grammars that are
commonly used in natural language processing, the grammar that the book actually
uses is one based on the Astfidhytiyi (pronounced &apos;ashtad&apos;yayee&apos;), humankind&apos;s earliest
extant grammar.
To begin with, some background with regard to this grammar is in order. The
Astadhyrzyi is a grammar of the Sanskrit language, as it was spoken by the descendants
of the Indo-Aryan tribe living on the Gangetic plain around the sixth century B.C. The
grammar, written or compiled by Pdr.tini, contains a little over 4,000 rules. Sanskrit, like
its European cousin Latin, is a language in which the most salient grammatical device
is inflection, while the least salient one is word order, and Par.tini&apos;s grammar reflects
this. The grammar is designed so that, together with a Sanskrit lexicon and a canonical
specification of a situation, it is supposed to generate all and only the correct Sanskrit
sentences expressing the situation. The assumption made is that each situation to be
expressed can be framed as an action or event (kriyii) with associated factors (lcaraka),
roughly valences. Once a one-to-one correspondence has been established between
the elements of a situation canonically framed, on the one hand, and underived root
morphemes from the lexicon, on the other, the grammar operates nondeterministically
to yield a set of morphologically well-formed words that together express the situation.
Up until the latter half of the twentieth century, Par.tini&apos;s grammar was the most
rigorous and comprehensive ever written for any language. Moreover, many, if not
most, of the key ideas in modern linguistic theory have their origin in the ideas of his
grammar (e.g., sandhi) or were anticipated by it (e.g., the theta criterion). The tradition
that the grammar initiated made Sanskrit, until this century, the most thoroughly
studied human language.
Though the languages of the Indian subcontinent belong to two distinct language
families, Indo-European (those descended from Sanskrit) and Dravidian, they have
much in common: in particular, they tend to be highly inflected. Hence, the treatment
of inflection, and not word order, must play the most important role in the processing
of such languages. English is a language in which inflection has only a marginal
role, while word order has a central role. As a result, it is not surprising that other
grammars—such as Government and Binding, lexical functional grammar, and head-
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3
driven phrase structure grammar, all of which are largely inspired by the study of
English—are not as well suited to analyze the languages of India as a grammar such
as Panini&apos;s. Hence, the authors&apos; development and deployment of a Paninian-style
grammar is particularly apt and insightful, especially given the range of languages
addressed.
The first chapter, entitled &apos;Introduction to NLP,&apos; provides a clear and concise
overview of the field of natural language processing, making clear the relevance of lin-
guistics to this domain. The basic grammatical concept of modification is introduced in
the second chapter, &apos;Language Structure and Language Analyzer,&apos; together with a dis-
cussion of those aspects of computation relevant to natural language processing. Since,
as was pointed out above, morphology plays a prominent role in the languages of the
Indian subcontinent, it is inevitable that one whole chapter, entitled &apos;Words and Their
Analyzer,&apos; should be devoted to morphological analysis. The specifically Partinian con-
cepts of the grammar are set out in the fourth through sixth chapters, entitled &apos;Local
Word Grouping,&apos; Pardnian Grammar,&apos; and &apos;Partinian Parser.&apos; An overview of Partini&apos;s
own grammar is set out in Appendix A, &apos;Partini&apos;s Grammar and Sanskrit.&apos; The next
chapter turns to machine translation. By using look-up and a morphological analyzer
and generator, a crude approximation of machine translation can be implemented, as
has, in fact, been done between Hindi, an Indo-European language, and Kannada, a
Dravidian language. The remaining six chapters of the book are devoted to a criti-
cal discussion and comparison of three major grammatical theories with the Paninian
grammar—lexical functional grammar, tree-adjoining grammars, and Government and
Binding.
The book is an introduction to natural language processing. As such, it inevitably
contains certain conflations, omissions, and abridgements. The most important abridge-
ments are those in the presentations of the other grammatical theories, where the dis-
cussions are absolutely minimal. Fortunately, each chapter is terminated by a useful
set of references to additional reading that can fill out the relevant grammatical theory.
The most important omission, in my view, is that of compounding. Compounding is
an important and productive feature of many Indian languages, yet it is not even men-
tioned. Par.iini&apos;s grammar treats compound formation and indeed, his treatment is the
one used by Robert Lees in his pioneering work The Grammar of English Nominalizations
(1960). However, Sanskrit compounds, like English compounds, are probably better
treated by context-free rules.
The most important conflation is that of complementation with modification. One
of the central grammatical concepts used in the book is termed modification. This term
is the English rendition of viS&apos;esya-vigesana-bhava, literally, the relation between what
qualifies and what is qualified. As used by Par.tini&apos;s successors and by the authors
of this book, the relation is more akin to the relation of subordination, including, on
the one hand, the relation of modification proper—that of an adjective to the noun
it modifies—and, on the other, the relation of complementation—that of noun phrase
and prepositional phrase complements of a verb to the verb.
None of these abridgements, conflations, or simplifications detracts from the book
in any way. This book provides a concise and clear introduction to natural language
processing, not only for anyone who wants to focus on the languages of India, but also
for anyone who wishes to have a perspective on natural language processing broader
than that attainable by a focus on English alone.
