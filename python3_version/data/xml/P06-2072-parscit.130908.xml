Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99970147368421">
In this paper we propose a small set of
lexical conceptual relations which allow
to encode adjectives in computational re-
lational lexica in a principled and inte-
grated way. Our main motivation comes
from the fact that adjectives and certain
classes of verbs, related in a way or an-
other with adjectives, do not have a satis-
factory representation in this kind of
lexica. This is due to a great extent to the
heterogeneity of their semantic and syn-
tactic properties. We sustain that such
properties are mostly derived from the
relations holding between adjectives and
other POS. Accordingly, our proposal is
mainly concerned with the specification
of appropriate cross-POS relations to en-
code adjectives in lexica of the type con-
sidered here.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999899115384615">
As well known, the experiment conducted by
George Miller on the mental lexicon properties
in the early 80s pointed out that lexical meaning
is derived from a set of lexical and conceptual
relations among concepts. Subsequently, a com-
putational lexicon conceived as a semantic net-
work has been built (the Princeton WordNet
(Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1998)). Given its psy-
chological plausibility and its crucial role for
applications like machine translation, informa-
tion retrieval and language learning systems,
among many others, this relational lexicon
model is being extensively adopted for machine
lexical knowledge representations, playing a
leading role in this field.
One of the most salient undertaking in this
domain is EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), a mul-
tilingual database which stores wordnets for sev-
eral European languages that follow the same
main lines as the Princeton WordNet (Miller,
1990; Fellbaum, 1998) and are inter-related
amongst them.
EuroWordNet wordnets follow the Princeton
WordNet model, but they are richer concerning
both the number and the nature of conceptual
relations.
The work depicted here programmatically
adopts the EuroWordNet framework.
In general terms, it deals with the specifica-
tions for an accurate modeling of lexical knowl-
edge in a EuroWordNet wordnet-like database
for Portuguese (WordNet.PT, henceforth), spe-
cifically focusing on the lexical semantics of
adjectives.
Although WordNet.PT (Marrafa, 2001; Mar-
rafa, 2002) is being developed in the general Eu-
roWordNet framework, basic research has been
carried out on Portuguese in order to guarantee
the WordNet.PT accuracy. This work has al-
ready led to some changes and new directions
(cf. Marrafa et al., (2006) and Amaro et al.,
(2006), for instance).
In this paper we propose a small set of new re-
lations which allow a strongly empirical moti-
vated encoding of the major POS in Word-
Net.PT, despite the fact that we particularly fo-
cus on adjectives. The empirical issues at stake
are described in section 2. In section 3 we dis-
cuss the strategies adopted in previous work car-
ried out both in WordNet and EuroWordNet
frameworks, in order to make their shortcomings
apparent. In section 4 we present our proposal

2 Empirical Issues
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999427962962963">
Adjective semantic analysis and representation is
far from being a trivial issue, as adjectives show
a very particular linguistic behavior, namely in
what concerns sense change depending on lin-
guistic context. Being so, there are several dif-
ferent typologies and classifications of adjectives
in the literature: semantic based classifications,
syntactic based classifications, classifications
regarding the relation holding between the adjec-
tive and the modified noun, and so on.
As our work on this issue progresses, it has
become clear that only a combination of syntac-
tic and semantic criteria can offer interesting
insights concerning adjective linguistic behavior
and the identification of relevant common fea-
tures, which may set the basis for an accurate
modeling of this POS in computational relational
lexica. In this section we will briefly look at
some of the main adjective classifications.
Regarding the way adjectives relate to the
noun they modify, we consider two classes:
property ascribing adjectives (in (1)), which add
a new restriction to the properties introduced by
the modified noun; and reference modifying ad-
jectives (in (2)), which behave like a semantic
operator, taking the reference of the modified
noun as its argument1.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.81820425">
(1) o livro azul
‘the blue book’
(2) o diamante falso
‘the fake diamond’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.961875833333334">
Adjectives like falso (fake), for instance, deal
with concepts instead of real or referential ob-
jects, showing how a concept applies to a par-
ticular object. These adjectives constitute a
closed class with very particular properties,
which makes them somewhat close to semantic
operators. In this work we will therefore focus
on property ascribing adjectives.
1 This distinction between property ascribing adjectives and
reference modifying adjectives is basically equivalent to
the one used in the SIMPLE project (Lenci et al., 2000)
(extensional vs. intensional adjectives, following Chier-
chia and McConnel-Ginet (1990)) to address the seman-
tics of adjectives. This distinction is also included in the
EAGLES recommendations for a semantic typology of
adjectives.
Demonte (1999) classifies property ascribing
adjectives based on their intrinsic meaning, a
classification combining syntactic and semantic
criteria to determine which adjectives belong to
which class. Two main subclasses are consid-
ered: descriptive adjectives and relational adjec-
tives. Each of these classes displays specific se-
mantic and syntactic properties.
In languages like Portuguese, descriptive ad-
jectives can occur both in attributive and predi-
cative contexts, while relational adjectives occur
almost exclusively in attributive contexts2. Both
prenominal and postnominal positions are possi-
ble for descriptive adjectives in attributive con-
texts. Relational adjectives, on the contrary, can
only occur in postnominal position. Finally, de-
scriptive adjectives are gradable, i.e. they can co-
occur with degree adverbs, which is not the case
for relational adjectives. However, these criteria
are not always sufficient to make a clear-cut dis-
tinction between relational and descriptive adjec-
tives. Demonte (1999) proposes some additional
criteria in order to make a more accurate distinc-
tion between these adjectives: their occurrence
in comparative structures, and the formation of
polarity systems.

<bodyText confidence="0.9051935625">
But most of all, and besides all the syntactical
contrasts we have mentioned above, there is a
clear contrast in the way these two adjective
classes relate to the noun they modify. Descrip-
tive adjectives ascribe a single property, setting a
value for an attribute, whereas relational adjec-
tives introduce a set of properties.
(5) o prédio alto
‘the high building’
2 Predicative contexts with relational adjectives are gener-
ally ruled out in Portuguese. Nonetheless, some specific
contexts, like contrastive contexts, for instance, seem to
license predicative uses of relational adjectives:
(I) As próximas eleições são autárquicas, não são
presidenciais.
‘next election will be autarchic, not presidential’

<listItem confidence="0.876651">
(6) a indústria alimentar
‘the alimentary industry’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999671941176471">
Looking at (5) and (6), we see that, while alto
(high) sets the value of the height attribute of
prédio (building) to high, alimentar (alimentary)
does not ascribe a single property, but a set of
properties to indiustria (industry). Moreover, this
set of properties corresponds to the main features
describing another noun – alimento (food) in the
example above. In fact, the way properties are
ascribed to the modified nouns in (5) and in (6)
are quite different. Ascribing a singular property
usually corresponds to an incidence relation of
this property in the nominal referent, while as-
cribing sets of properties usually entails more
complex and diversified semantic relations.
However, despite the relevance of the descrip-
tive/relational dichotomy, it cannot account for
the following contrasts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97958725">
(7) a. *Ele viu a Maria alta.
‘He saw Mary tall’
b. Ele viu a Maria triste.
‘He saw Mary sad’.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998311314285714">
Both alta and triste are descriptive adjectives,
but they do not behave in the same way regard-
ing secondary predication.
We can refine the classification, considering,
for instance, the opposition between accidental
properties and permanent or inherent properties
(this distinction goes back to Milsark (1974;
1977) and Carlson (1977)). According to this
distinction, the property denoted by alta (tall)
belongs to the latter class and the property de-
noted by triste (sad) to the former one. However,
as pointed out by Marrafa (2004) and previous
work, the characterization of adjectives on the
basis of this dichotomy is not straightforward,
since certain adjectives are ambiguous with re-
gard to those properties, as it is the case of triste
(sad). In the example above triste (sad) denotes
an accidental property, but in an expression like
um livro triste (a sad book) it denotes a perma-
nent property.
Intuitively, we can say that triste (sad) ex-
presses a state of tristeza (sadness), but we let
the discussion of the status of this relation out of
the scope of this paper.
Nevertheless, this kind of adjectives is of
great importance to model telic verbs. The se-
mantics of telic verbs involves a change of state
of their theme argument, i.e. the subevent that
closes the whole event is an atomic event, (a
state) that affects the theme and is different from
its initial state. As argued in Marrafa (2005) and
previous work, by default, verbs like lavar (to
wash) are associated to the following Lexical-
Conceptual Structure (LCS’ in Pustejovsky
(1991)):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8476565">
(8) [T [P act(x,y)and ~ Q(y)], [eQ(y)]]
T:transition, P:process, e: event, Q: atomic event
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.764027666666667">
When syntactically realized, the telic subevent
generally corresponds to an adjectival constitu-
ent, like in the example below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.757628454545454">
(9) Ele lavou a camisa bem lavada.
&apos;He washed the shirt well washed&apos;
In (9) the absence of the telic expression bem
lavada (well washed) does not induce ungram-
maticality. However, in the case of verbs like
tornar (to make), it seems impossible to assign a
value to Q independently of the telic expression.
(10) a. Ele tornou a Maria triste.
‘He made Mary sad’
b. *Ele tornou a Maria.
&apos;He made Mary&apos;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989494111111111">
Along the lines of Marrafa (1993) and further
work, verbs like tornar (to make) are assumed
here to be LCS deficitary, the telic expression
filling the gap of the LCS of the verb.
As shown below, the troponyms of these verbs
incorporate the telic state:
(12) a. Ele entristeceu a Maria.
&apos;He saddened Mary&apos;
b. *Ele entristeceu a Maria triste.
&apos;He saddened Mary sad&apos;
The grammaticality contrast above is due to
the fact that entristecer (to sadden) incorporates
the telic state. This justifies that this verb can be
paraphrased by tornar triste (to make sad).
In this section we have mainly focused on
property ascribing adjectives. We have consid-
ered two main subclasses, descriptive and rela-
tional adjectives, briefly presenting their syntac-
tic and semantic behavior with regard to grad-
ability, formation of polarity systems and their
occurrence in predicative and attributive (both
pronominally and postnominally) contexts and
comparative structures. We have also addressed
the issue of adjective relation with the noun they
modify. Different adjective behavior regarding
secondary predication is also discussed and ana-
lyzed in terms of the opposition between acci-

dental and permanent properties. The properties
discussed in this section should be encoded in
computational relational lexica such as wordnets.

3 Adjectives in WordNet and in Eu-
roWordNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998506730769231">
Hyponymy is the main structuring relation both
in WordNet and in EuroWordNet. However, the
semantic organization of adjectives is entirely
different from that of other POS: nothing like the
hierarchies of hyponymic (in the semantic or-
ganization of nouns) and troponymic relations
(in the semantic organization of verbs) is avail-
able for adjectives. Even if it is possible to find
some small local hierarchies, hypero-
nymy/hyponymy is far from being the crucial
semantic relation in the organization of adjec-
tives in relational lexical databases such as
wordnets.
However, some authors working within the
EuroWordNet framework have reconsidered the
possibility of encoding hyponymy for adjectives.
Hamp and Feldweg (1998), in the development
of GermaNet, abandon the cluster organization
of WordNet in favor of a hierarchical structuring
of adjectives, arguing for a uniform treatment of
all POS. Even though taxonomic chains of adjec-
tives yield rather flat in comparison to those of
nouns and verbs, these authors claim to derive
more structural information from these small
taxonomies than from clusters, as they seek to
eliminate what they consider to be the ‘rather
fuzzy concept of indirect antonyms’. Even
though the concept of indirect antonymy is not
completely clear, it is not obvious to us why this
fact should entail that adjectives must show a
hierarchical organization instead.
In ItalWordNet, Alonge et al. (2000) also or-
ganize adjectives into classes sharing a su-
perordinate. These classes correspond to adjec-
tives sharing some semantic features, and are
generally rather flat. These authors argue for the
possibility of inferring semantic preferences and
syntactic characteristics of adjectives found in
the same taxonomy. The SIMPLE project ad-
dresses the semantics of adjectives in a similar
way, identifying a set of common features rele-
vant for classifying and describing adjective be-
havior. However, as noted by Peters and Peters
(2000), even though similarities exist “adjectives
belonging to the same semantic class may differ
from each other in numerous ways”, i.e. the
classes established in this way are not homoge-
neous.
In WordNet, descriptive and relational adjec-
tives are distinguished, first, by being encoded in
separate files, and second, by the relations hold-
ing between synsets.
Descriptive adjectives are organized in clus-
ters of synsets, each cluster being associated by
semantic similarity to a focal adjective which is
linked to a contrasting cluster through an an-
tonymy relation. Therefore, antonymy is the ba-
sic semantic relation used in WordNet to encode
descriptive adjectives. As argued for in Miller
(1998), this cluster organization of adjectives
seems to mirror psychological principles. In fact,
this organization is clearly motivated if we rec-
ognize that these adjectives main function re-
gards the expression of attributes, and that an
important number of attributes are bipolar.
Relational adjectives, on the other hand, do
not have antonyms. Therefore, they cannot be
organized in opposite clusters. As pointed out by
Levi (1978), the intrinsic meaning of these ad-
jectives is something along the following lines:
‘of, relating/pertaining to, associated with’ some
noun. The way these adjectives are encoded in
WordNet mirrors this as it links relational adjec-
tives to the nouns they relate to.
In GermaNet a distinct treatment of relational
and descriptive adjectives is abandoned, as the
distinction between these two classes is consid-
ered to be ‘not at all clear’. Nonetheless, the
WordNet strategy for distinguishing between
different adjective classes is maintained: listing
lexical items in different files3.
As pointed out in the previous section, even if
the distinction between these two classes is not
always clear-cut, testing adjectives against the
set of syntactic and semantic criteria presented in
section 2 allows us to distinguish descriptive
from relational adjectives. We consider that this
distinction can be mirrored in the database via
the semantic relations expressed in the network,
adjective listing in different files not being there-
fore necessary. In order to do this we propose
several cross-POS relations, since in the Eu-
roWordNet model, unlike what happens in
WordNet where each POS forms a separate sys-
tem, it is possible to relate lexical items belong-
ing to different POS. Such an approach has the
3 GermaNet classifies the adjectives into 15 semantic
classes, following the classes proposed by Hundsnurscher
and Splett (1982), with some minor changes: percep-
tional, spatial, temporality-related, motion-related, mate-
rial-related, weather-related, body-related, mood-related,
spirit-related, behaviour-related, social-related, quantity-
related, relational and general adjectives. One special
class is added for pertainyms.

It is undeniable that important structural infor-
mation can be extracted from the hierarchical
organization of lexical items, namely of nouns
and verbs. However, extending wordnets to all
the main POS involves a revision of certain
commonly used relations and the specification of
several cross-POS relations.
We previously mentioned that adjectives show
a very particular semantic organization. Thus,
encoding adjectives in wordnets calls for the
specification of a number of cross-POS semantic
relations. Here we use these cross-POS semantic
relations to mirror adjectives main features in
wordnet-like databases, which allows us to make
adjective classes emerge from the relations ex-
pressed in the network.
According to the strategies discussed in Men-
des (2006), we present here the relations we ar-
gue are appropriate to encode adjectives and
show how they conform to some complex phe-
nomena.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999329">
4.1 Relating Adjectives and Nouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99982415">
To put it somewhat simplistically, descriptive
adjectives ascribe a value of an attribute to a
noun. We link each descriptive adjective to the
attribute it modifies via the semantic relation
characterizes with regard to/can be character-
ized by4. Thus, instead of linking adjectives
amongst themselves by a similarity relation, fol-
lowing what is done in WordNet, all adjectives
modifying the same attribute are linked to the
noun that lexicalizes this attribute. This way, and
in combination with the antonymy relation, we
obtain the cluster effect argued to be the basis of
the organization of adjectives (Miller, 1998;
Fellbaum et al, 1993), without having to encode
it directly in the database.
As shown by word association tests, antonymy
is also a basic relation in the organization of de-
scriptive adjectives. Nonetheless, this relation
does not correspond to conceptual opposition,
which is one of the semantic relations used for

<bodyText confidence="0.999966115384616">
the definition of adjective clusters. We argue
that conceptual opposition does not have to be
explicitly encoded in wordnets, since it is possi-
ble to infer it from the combination of synonymy
and antonymy relations (see Mendes (2006) for
more details).
Concerning relational adjectives, even though
they are also property ascribing adjectives, they
entail more complex and diversified relations
between the set of properties they introduce and
the modified noun, often pointing to the denota-
tion of another noun (cf. section 2). We use the
is related to relation to encode this.
Therefore, the characterizes with regard
to/can be characterized by and the antonymy
relations, for descriptive adjectives, and the is
related to relation for relational adjectives, al-
lows us to encode the basic features of these ad-
jectives in computational relational lexica such
as wordnets, while making it possible to derive
membership to these classes from the relations
expressed in the network.
Another issue regarding adjectives is that they
have a rather sparse net of relations. We intro-
duce a new relation to encode salient characteris-
tics of nouns: is characteristic of/has as a char-
acteristic to be. These characteristics are often
expressed by adjectival expressions. Although in
terms of lexical knowledge we can discuss the
status of this relation, it regards crucial informa-
tion for many wordnet-based applications,
namely those using inference systems, allowing
for richer and clearer synsets.
Also, it may allow for deducing semantic do-
mains from the database, as it makes it possible
to identify the typical semantic domains of ap-
plication of adjectives. Research on the classes
and semantic domains emerging from the rela-
tions expressed in the database is still ongoing.
Thus, the combination of these relations al-
lows us to encode a less sparse net of adjectives.
Besides the importance of having a more dense
net from the point of view of wordnet-based ap-
plications, as mentioned above, this is also cru-
cial with regard to relational lexica such as
wordnets themselves, as the meaning of each
unit is determined by the set of relations it holds
with other units. Thus, a denser network of rela-
tions allows for richer and clearer synsets. Fig. 1
illustrates this idea, presenting an example of the
way adjectives are being encoded in Word-
Net.PT.

4.2 Relating Adjectives and Verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999707133333333">
We also introduce new semantic relations to en-
code telic verbs in the database (on this issue see
also Marrafa, 2005; Amaro et al., 2006).
As shown in section 2, the facts render evident
that the representation of LCS deficitary telic
verbs has to include information regarding the
telic expression. Obviously, it would not be ade-
quate to overtly include in the synset all the ex-
pressions that can integrate the predicate, among
other reasons, because they seem to constitute an
open set. Rather, we claim that we can capture
the telicity of these verbs by including a new
relation in the set of internal relations of word-
nets: the telic sub-event relation, as exemplified
below.

Relating make to state by means of this rela-
tion, we capture the telic properties of the verb
and let the specific nature of the final state un-
derspecified. This way, we also account for the
weakness of the verb selection restrictions. As
expected, we can also use this relation to encode
telicity in the case of the troponyms of the class
of verbs discussed in section 2.

in wordnets, in accordance with the empirical
evidence.
It should be noticed that the existing sub-event
relation in the EuroWordNet framework is dif-
ferent from the relation proposed here. It only
stands for lexical entailment involving temporal
proper inclusion. Therefore, it does not account
for the geometry of the event. On the contrary,
the telic sub-event relation regards the atomic

As previously mentioned, the proposal presented
in this paper is mainly concerned with the speci-
fication of appropriate cross-POS relations to
encode adjectives in computational relational
lexica.
In order to test whether the set of relations
presented here is appropriate and allows the en-
coding of adjectives in wordnet-like lexica, we
have introduced a selection of Portuguese adjec-
tives in WordNet.PT.
In the first phase of the WordNet.PT project
mostly nouns were encoded in the database.
Thus, we have mainly focused on the encoding
of relations between adjectives and nouns7. Ta-

specified at the present stage.

adjectives in WordNet.PT
Besides the discussion presented above, the
implemented data, being already a representative
sample, show that the cross-POS relations pro-
posed here effectively allow for a fine-grained
encoding of adjectives in relational lexica (spe-
cifically in wordnet-like lexica) through the
specification of a denser network of relations.

In this paper we argue that the semantics of ad-
jectives can be appropriately captured in word-
net-like lexica by means of the implementation
of a small set of new relations, which have a
strong linguistic motivation and preserve the co-
herence of the model.
We focus on property ascribing adjectives and
we distinguish between descriptive and rela-
tional adjectives. Besides the relevance of this
dichotomy, we also address the opposition be-
tween accidental and permanent properties, as
adjective association to certain kind of properties

Here, we model these distinctions in Word-

descriptive adjectives introducing permanent
properties; has_telic_subevent/is_telic_subevent

cidental properties; and the is related to to model
relational adjectives.
Moreover, we make apparent that increasing
the expressive power of the system has an impor-
tant impact in precision concerning the specifica-
tions of all POS, mainly induced by the cross-
POS relations.
This way, we provide a simple and integrated
solution for a complex and heterogeneous prob-
lem.

<abstract confidence="0.9937485">In this paper we propose a small set of lexical conceptual relations which allow to encode adjectives in computational relational lexica in a principled and integrated way. Our main motivation comes from the fact that adjectives and certain classes of verbs, related in a way or another with adjectives, do not have a satisfactory representation in this kind of lexica. This is due to a great extent to the heterogeneity of their semantic and syntactic properties. We sustain that such properties are mostly derived from the relations holding between adjectives and other POS. Accordingly, our proposal is mainly concerned with the specification of appropriate cross-POS relations to encode adjectives in lexica of the type considered here.</abstract>

Even though taxonomic chains of adjectives yield rather flat in comparison to those of nouns and verbs, these authors claim to derive more structural information from these small taxonomies than from clusters, as they seek to eliminate what they consider to be the ‘rather fuzzy concept of indirect antonyms’. Even though the concept of indirect antonymy is not completely clear, it is not obvious to us why this fact should entail that adjectives must show a hierarchical organization instead. In ItalWordNet, Alonge et al. (2000) also organize adjectives into classes sharing a superordinate. These classes correspond to adjectives sharing some semantic features, and are generally rather flat. These authors argue for the possibility of inferring semantic preferences and syntactic characteristics of adjectives found in the same taxonomy. The SIMPLE project addresses the semantics of adjectives in a similar way, identifying a set of common features relevant for classifying and describing adjective behavior.

In general terms, it deals with the specifications for an accurate modeling of lexical knowledge in a EuroWordNet wordnet-like database for Portuguese (WordNet.PT, henceforth), specifically focusing on the lexical semantics of adjectives. Although WordNet.PT (Marrafa, 2001; Marrafa, 2002) is being developed in the general EuroWordNet framework, basic research has been carried out on Portuguese in order to guarantee the WordNet.PT accuracy. This work has already led to some changes and new directions (cf. Marrafa et al., (2006) and Amaro et al., (2006), for instance). In this paper we propose a small set of new relations which allow a strongly empirical motivated encoding of the major POS in WordNet.PT, despite the fact that we particularly focus on adjectives. The empirical issues at stake are described in section 2. In section 3 we discuss the strategies adopted in previous work carried out both in WordNet and EuroWordNet frameworks, in order to make their shortcomings apparent.

As shown in section 2, the facts render evident that the representation of LCS deficitary telic verbs has to include information regarding the telic expression. Obviously, it would not be adequate to overtly include in the synset all the expressions that can integrate the predicate, among other reasons, because they seem to constitute an open set. Rather, we claim that we can capture the telicity of these verbs by including a new relation in the set of internal relations of wordnets: the telic sub-event relation, as exemplified below.

However, despite the relevance of the descriptive/relational dichotomy, it cannot account for the following contrasts: (7) a. *Ele viu a Maria alta. ‘He saw Mary tall’ b. Ele viu a Maria triste. ‘He saw Mary sad’. Both alta and triste are descriptive adjectives, but they do not behave in the same way regarding secondary predication. We can refine the classification, considering, for instance, the opposition between accidental properties and permanent or inherent properties (this distinction goes back to Milsark (1974; 1977) and Carlson (1977)). According to this distinction, the property denoted by alta (tall) belongs to the latter class and the property denoted by triste (sad) to the former one. However, as pointed out by Marrafa (2004) and previous work, the characterization of adjectives on the basis of this dichotomy is not straightforward, since certain adjectives are ambiguous with regard to those properties, as it is the case of triste (sad). In the example above triste (sad) denotes an accidental property, but in an expression like um livro triste (a sad book) it denotes a permanent property. Intuitively, we can say that t</context>

Accordingly, our proposal is mainly concerned with the specification of appropriate cross-POS relations to encode adjectives in lexica of the type considered here. 1 Introduction As well known, the experiment conducted by George Miller on the mental lexicon properties in the early 80s pointed out that lexical meaning is derived from a set of lexical and conceptual relations among concepts. Subsequently, a computational lexicon conceived as a semantic network has been built (the Princeton WordNet (Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1998)). Given its psychological plausibility and its crucial role for applications like machine translation, information retrieval and language learning systems, among many others, this relational lexicon model is being extensively adopted for machine lexical knowledge representations, playing a leading role in this field. One of the most salient undertaking in this domain is EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), a multilingual database which stores wordnets for several European languages that follow the same main lines as the Princeton WordNet (Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1998) and are inter-related amongst the</context>

Therefore, antonymy is the basic semantic relation used in WordNet to encode descriptive adjectives. As argued for in Miller (1998), this cluster organization of adjectives seems to mirror psychological principles. In fact, this organization is clearly motivated if we recognize that these adjectives main function regards the expression of attributes, and that an important number of attributes are bipolar. Relational adjectives, on the other hand, do not have antonyms. Therefore, they cannot be organized in opposite clusters. As pointed out by Levi (1978), the intrinsic meaning of these adjectives is something along the following lines: ‘of, relating/pertaining to, associated with’ some noun. The way these adjectives are encoded in WordNet mirrors this as it links relational adjectives to the nouns they relate to. In GermaNet a distinct treatment of relational and descriptive adjectives is abandoned, as the distinction between these two classes is considered to be ‘not at all clear’. Nonetheless, the WordNet strategy for distinguishing between different adjective classes is maintained: listing lexical items in different files3. As pointed out </context>

Nevertheless, this kind of adjectives is of great importance to model telic verbs. The semantics of telic verbs involves a change of state of their theme argument, i.e. the subevent that closes the whole event is an atomic event, (a state) that affects the theme and is different from its initial state. As argued in Marrafa (2005) and previous work, by default, verbs like lavar (to wash) are associated to the following LexicalConceptual Structure (LCS’ in Pustejovsky (1991)): (8) [T [P act(x,y)and ~ Q(y)], [eQ(y)]] T:transition, P:process, e: event, Q: atomic event When syntactically realized, the telic subevent generally corresponds to an adjectival constituent, like in the example below: (9) Ele lavou a camisa bem lavada. &apos;He washed the shirt well washed&apos; In (9) the absence of the telic expression bem lavada (well washed) does not induce ungrammaticality.

As shown in section 2, the facts render evident that the representation of LCS deficitary telic verbs has to include information regarding the telic expression. Obviously, it would not be adequate to overtly include in the synset all the expressions that can integrate the predicate, among other reasons, because they seem to constitute an open set. Rather, we claim that we can capture the telicity of these verbs by including a new relation in the set of internal relations of wordnets: the telic sub-event relation, as exemplified below.

However, extending wordnets to all the main POS involves a revision of certain commonly used relations and the specification of several cross-POS relations. We previously mentioned that adjectives show a very particular semantic organization. Thus, encoding adjectives in wordnets calls for the specification of a number of cross-POS semantic relations. Here we use these cross-POS semantic relations to mirror adjectives main features in wordnet-like databases, which allows us to make adjective classes emerge from the relations expressed in the network. According to the strategies discussed in Mendes (2006), we present here the relations we argue are appropriate to encode adjectives and show how they conform to some complex phenomena. 4.1 Relating Adjectives and Nouns To put it somewhat simplistically, descriptive adjectives ascribe a value of an attribute to a noun. We link each descriptive adjective to the attribute it modifies via the semantic relation characterizes with regard to/can be characterized by4. Thus, instead of linking adjectives amongst themselves by a similarity relation, following what is done in WordNet, all adjectives modifying the same attribute are linked to the noun that l</context>

We argue that conceptual opposition does not have to be explicitly encoded in wordnets, since it is possible to infer it from the combination of synonymy and antonymy relations (see Mendes (2006) for more details). Concerning relational adjectives, even though they are also property ascribing adjectives, they entail more complex and diversified relations between the set of properties they introduce and the modified noun, often pointing to the denotation of another noun (cf. section 2). We use the is related to relation to encode this.

Accordingly, our proposal is mainly concerned with the specification of appropriate cross-POS relations to encode adjectives in lexica of the type considered here. 1 Introduction As well known, the experiment conducted by George Miller on the mental lexicon properties in the early 80s pointed out that lexical meaning is derived from a set of lexical and conceptual relations among concepts. Subsequently, a computational lexicon conceived as a semantic network has been built (the Princeton WordNet (Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1998)). Given its psychological plausibility and its crucial role for applications like machine translation, information retrieval and language learning systems, among many others, this relational lexicon model is being extensively adopted for machine lexical knowledge representations, playing a leading role in this field. One of the most salient undertaking in this domain is EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), a multilingual database which stores wordnets for several European languages that follow the same main lines as the Princeton WordNet (Miller, 1990; Fellbaum, 1998) and are inter-re</context>

In WordNet, descriptive and relational adjectives are distinguished, first, by being encoded in separate files, and second, by the relations holding between synsets. Descriptive adjectives are organized in clusters of synsets, each cluster being associated by semantic similarity to a focal adjective which is linked to a contrasting cluster through an antonymy relation. Therefore, antonymy is the basic semantic relation used in WordNet to encode descriptive adjectives. As argued for in Miller (1998), this cluster organization of adjectives seems to mirror psychological principles. In fact, this organization is clearly motivated if we recognize that these adjectives main function regards the expression of attributes, and that an important number of attributes are bipolar. Relational adjectives, on the other hand, do not have antonyms. Therefore, they cannot be organized in opposite clusters. As pointed out by Levi (1978), the intrinsic meaning of these adjectives is something along the following lines: ‘of, relating/pertaining to, associated with’ some noun.

These authors argue for the possibility of inferring semantic preferences and syntactic characteristics of adjectives found in the same taxonomy. The SIMPLE project addresses the semantics of adjectives in a similar way, identifying a set of common features relevant for classifying and describing adjective behavior. However, as noted by Peters and Peters (2000), even though similarities exist “adjectives belonging to the same semantic class may differ from each other in numerous ways”, i.e. the classes established in this way are not homogeneous.
