<bodyText confidence="0.999739642857143">
This paper discusses a method for identifying
diabetes symptoms and conditions in free text
electronic health records in Bulgarian. The
main challenge is to automatically recognise
phrases and paraphrases for which no ”canon-
ical forms” exist in any dictionary. The fo-
cus is on extracting blood sugar level and
body weight change which are some of the
dominant factors when diagnosing diabetes.
A combined machine-learning and rule-based
approach is applied. The experiment is per-
formed on 2031 sentences of diabetes case his-
tory. The F-measure varies between 60 and
96% in the separate processing phases.

<bodyText confidence="0.999303352941177">
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a rich source
of information regarding patient’s health condition
and treatment over time but they often exist as free
text only. Currently great efforts are put into struc-
turing such data and making them available for fur-
ther automatic processing, the so-called secondary
use of EHRs. Following this line of work in this
paper we present a pilot study for extracting con-
dition descriptions from EHRs in Bulgarian with the
help of NLP techniques thus making a step toward
the structuring of the free text. The specificity of
the EHRs as a combination of biomedical termi-
nology in an underresourced language and a source
of valuable health-care data makes them attractive
for various medical and language research tasks.
We present an algorithm which comprises machine
learning (ML) techniques and rule-based analysis to

automatically identify phrases and paraphrases, for
which no ”canonical forms” exist in any dictionary,
with minimal effort. We analyse anonymous EHRs
of patients diagnosed with diabetes.
We focus on extracting the levels of blood sugar
and body weight change (examples are given in ta-
ble 1) which are some of the dominant factors when
diagnosing diabetes but we believe this approach can
extend to recognise also other symptoms or medica-
tion expressions which have similar record structure.
We extract information which is on one hand very
important for the professionals and on the other hand
not directly observable in a collection of unstruc-
tured documents because of its composite mean-
ing. In Bulgarian EHRs laboratory data is some-
times present inline in the text only and means for
extracting such information from the plain text mes-
sage are often needed.
The paper is structured as follows: section 2
presents related studies, section 4 describes the
method, and section 3 the experiments. The results
are given in section 5 and the conclusion in section 6.

There are several successful systems for identifying
patient characteristics and health conditions, mostly
in English documents. The one presented by Savova
et al. (2008) solves the task of identifying the smok-
ing status of patients by accurately classifying in-
dividual sentences from the patient records. They
achieve F-measure 85.57. One of the limitations is
the lack of negation detection. Similarly to their ap-
proach our source documents are decomposed into
sentences which are to be classified. The symptom

descriptions are short and always written within a
single sentence, therefore it is important to filter out
the irrelevant sentences. We employ ML techniques
and rule-based analysis and in addition deal with
negation detection.
Harkema et al. (2009) presents an algorithm
called ConText, which determines whether clinical
conditions mentioned in clinical reports are negated,
hypothetical, historical, or experienced by someone
other than the patient. The system is entirely rule-
based and infers the status of a condition from sim-
ple lexical clues occurring in the context of the con-
dition. This algorithm proves successful in process-
ing different clinical report types with F-measure for
negation (75-95%), historical (22-84%), hypotheti-
cal (86-96%) and experiencer (100%) depending on
the report types. Our work rests on a similar idea –
we prepare a set of vocabularies which are learned
from data and are used for determining the scope of
the expressions of interest but we focus on extracting
health conditions, their status, values and negation.
Negation is one of the most important features to
be recognized in medical texts. There is a work for
Bulgarian by Boytcheva (2005) which specifically
tackles the negation by the presence of triggering ex-
pression as we do too.
Many systems implement isolated condition iden-
tification and rarely complete semantic model of
all conditions, e.g. MedLEE (Friedman, 1994),
MEDSYNDIKATE (Hahn, 2002) etc. identify the
status condition and also modifying information like
anatomic location, negation, change over time. In
Boytcheva et al. (2010) the authors extract from Bul-
garian EHRs the status of the patient skin, limbs, and
neck with thyroid gland with high accuracy.

Source Data This work is done on free text EHRs
of diabetic patients submitted by the Endocrinol-
ogy Hospital of the Medical University in Sofia.
The health conditions are written in the case history
which describes the diabetes development, compli-
cations, their corresponding treatment, etc. Symp-
tom descriptions are written within a single sen-
tence (sometimes other symptoms are described in
the same sentence too) as shown in table 1.
Our training corpus is a subset of anamnesis sen-
Ex. 1. Pri izsledvane kr•vnata zahar e bila -
14 mmol/l. (After examination the blood sugar was
- 14 mmol/l.)
Ex. 2. Postypva po povod na poliuriqno-
polidipsiqen sindrom, redukcia na tegloto i

polydipsia syndrome, weight reduction and ketoacido-
sis.)

tences regarding only symptom descriptions. It is
annotated with symptom type on sentence level and
with symptom description on token level. These are
excerpts from from 100 epicrises. All sentences are
marked with class ”bs” (blood sugar), ”bwc” (body
weight change) or another symptom. The sentences
that describe more symptoms have more than one la-
bel. These data was used for learning the rules and
the vocabularies. The experimental/test dataset con-
sists of 2031 anamnesis sentences annotated with
symptoms. The documents are manually sentence
split and automatically tokenized. To overcome the
inflexion and gain a wider coverage of the rules we
also use stemmed forms (Nakov, 2010).
Vocabularies The algorithm relies on a set of spe-
cific vocabularies manually built from the anno-
tated training set. We build a Focal Term Vocab-
ulary which contains words and phrases signalling
the presence of the health condition description (e.g.
”glycemic control”, ”hypoglycemia” etc.). It is used
for defining the condition in phase 2. All single
words which appear in this vocabulary except for the
stop words form the so called Key Term Vocabulary
used in the phase 1 classification task.
There are two vocabularies containing border
terms: one with rightmost context border expres-
sions (Right Border Vocabulary); and one with left
border expressions (Left Border Vocabulary). These
are conjunctions and phrases separating the blood
sugar level description from another observation
preceding it. Both vocabularies are sorted in de-
scending order by the probability of occurrence as-
sociated with each expression as border term.
A Vocabulary of Negation Expressions is also
compiled as well as a Vocabulary of Condition
Statuses (e.g. ”good”, ”bad”, ”increased” etc.).

4 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999403204545455">
We aim at identifying health conditions in the EHR
case history. The problem can be broken down into
the following subtasks: Phase 1: identify the rele-
vant sentences; Phase 2: identify the condition and
its status; Phase 3: identify the values related to the
symptom of interest - mmol/l, kg etc.; Phase 4: iden-
tify negation; Phase 5: identify the scope of the de-
scription - match left and right border terms.
Two experiments for accomplishing phase 1 have
been carried out: a rule-based one and ML-based
one. In the ML setting we train a binary classifica-
tion algorithm. We experiment with 3 feature sets:
(i) all tokens in the corpus; (ii) the tokens from Key
Term Vocabulary and (iii) restricted subset of the
Key Term Vocabulary. In all cases each sentence
is considered a document and each document fea-
ture vector contains the following boolean values for
each feature: the feature value is true iff the docu-
ment contains the corresponding token from the fea-
ture set, otherwise it is false. In this setting we use
the experimental corpus which we split in folds for
training and testing and the vocabularies which are
learned from the training corpus.
In the rule-based experiment, we construct light-
weight regular expressions that match symptom de-
scriptions in the training set. We model them in con-
text window of up to 5-7 tokens to the left and right
of the focal terms depending on the kind of expres-
sion. When composing the rules like in figure 1 we
introduce new links between tokens which are not
subsequent in the training dataset, if the newly cre-
ated token sequences would be meaningful focal ex-
pressions. The black edges are obtained from the
training corpus and the dashed grey one is manually
added. This approach would not harm any identifi-
cation procedure because it can match only an ex-
isting sequence in the target text therefore we can
only benefit from such augmented rules. Moreover
these rules are crafted for stemmed text which par-
tially overcomes the morphological agreement prob-
lem (Bulgarian is a highly inflective language) thus
they have wider coverage on the possible signalling
words (see table 2). The sentences matching these
rules are passed to phase 2.

<bodyText confidence="0.99985071875">
At phase 2 the condition status is recognised. The
blood sugar level is most often cited as low, high
or normal and could be also bad or good, body
weight can be increased or decreased. The context
words which signal the status of the condition appear
on the left side of the focal terms, such as: s vi-
soki sto$inosti na kr. zahar (with high values of
the blood sugar); lox glikemiqen kontrol (bad
glycemic control).
Phase 3 analysis is related to the dynamic exten-
sion of the right context of the analysed expression
in order to cover all necessary attributes. At this
phase we aim at identifying the value of the blood
sugar test if there is such. The values of this test are
given in various ways – as an interval of values; as
a maximal value reached during some period or a
concrete value. At this step we apply rules matching
vocabulary words signalling the type of value rep-
resentation e.g. me&gt;Kdu (between); do (up to); nad
(above); okolo (around).
When the algorithm recognises a word signalling
interval value representation such as me&gt;Kdu (be-
tween), it takes action to expand the right context
to the next two numbers and measuring unit af-
ter the second one, but with no more than 7 to-
kens. If the numbers fall out of this 7-token window
they are ignored and the value identification algo-
rithm fails. We determined the 7-token window ex-
perimentally by analysing the training set of EHRs
where often verbs expressing temporality are con-
necting/separating the focal terms from the ones de-
scribing lab test values (as shown in table 3).

<bodyText confidence="0.999914033333333">
In phase 4 we recognise negation. We observe
only limited occurrences of negations in the text.
This is due to the fact that in Bulgarian prac-
tice mostly medical conditions with pathological
changes are described. The expressions signalling
negation appear on the left context of the phrases
marked at phase 1 and they modify the expres-
sions identified at phase 2. Some examples are:
He C�o6n�aBa 3a... (does not inform about...); He
IMHoPo] BHCoKH CTof4HoCT14 Ha ... (not [very] high
values of...).
Phase 5 identifies the symptom description scope.
It is determined by the context words which signal
the beginning of the expression, its ending and the
already identified attributes. The expression of in-
terest either starts at the beginning of the sentence or
follows another description and conjunctions. The
end of the expression is either coinciding with the
end of the sentence, or is signalled by a value of the
blood sugar test, or a description of another symp-
tom (see table 4). The border identification rules
are applied on the right and on the left of the al-
ready identified attributes starting from the rule hav-
ing highest probability and continue in descending
order until a match is found. If no match is found in
7-token context window the right border is consid-
ered the right most token of the current expression
and the left border of the expression is either the first
token of the focal term or negation of the expression
or status of the condition.

The applied classification algorithm is a standard
J48 decision tree which we consider appropriate,
given the fact we supply binary data (Visa et al.,
2007). We used Weka Data Mining Software (Hall,
2007) for performing the tests. The results with best
settings are shown in table 5.
To achieve these results we did several experi-
ments on the test set, using the features selected
from the training set. The initial test was done
with a feature set comprising all tokens in the text
collection except for stop words. The achieved F-
measure was about 82 in 10-fold cross-validation, to
89% in isolated experiments and up to 92% on bal-
anced datasets. The precision was as high as 92%
and the recall varying from 73 to 85% in the dif-
ferent symptoms. In the second round the feature
set contained only tokens from the Key Term Vo-
cabulary. This boosted up the classification perfor-
mance to 90% F-measure for blood sugar and body
weight change. When we restricted the feature space
once again leaving only the most significant symp-
tom words in the feature space the performance was
about 89% F-measure. In all cases the precision var-
ied about 92-94%, and up to 98% when classifying
blood sugar level with the full keyword set, which
is encouraging. At that time the recall was about
75% in blood sugar identification and this could be
explained with the highly imbalanced dataset. Only
about 20% of the sentences were blood sugar related
and 6% body weight change related. These results

show that even without introducing domain knowl-
edge and using the full feature space the positive out-
put predictions are reliable. SVM classification was
also tested but it was outperformed by J48.
Table 5 shows that the precision of the rule-based
approach is higher than the one obtained by auto-
matic classification. However during the error anal-
ysis we noticed that in the rule-based setting some
true positives were wrongly classified as such be-
cause they matched non symptom related expres-
sions in sentences where the symptoms occur and re-
spectively are annotated as positive. In means of pre-
cision both approaches differ only in about 2 points
which invokes the assumption that they are compa-
rable to each other and could be used as alternatives
for experiments on a larger scale even without in-
corporating domain knowledge, especially in such
a task where the accuracy of the extraction is more
important than the coverage.

5.2 Phase by Phase Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925979591837">
Results from the separate phases of rule-based anal-
ysis are shown in table 6.
At phase 2 the tokens available in the training set
are completely recognised; there is a group of to-
kens which are not available in the training set, but
during the phase 1 processing fall into the scope of
the expression of interest. These ones are included
to the condition description without having assigned
any status class. Tokens may not be identified for
two reasons – they are not available in the training
set or they are misplaced (e.g. the target adjective is
following the focal expression instead of preceding
it, as it happens in all training set examples). 45%
of the attributes expressing blood sugar status are
recognised and 78.1% espressing body weight. Al-
though the recall for blood sugar seems to be low at
this phase, the result is actually good because dur-
ing the error analysis we found out that 60% of the
tokens which were not identified were equivalent.
At phase 3 the main problem for value recogni-
tion were the alphanumerical expressions of lab test
values which occur comparatively rare and have a
wide range of spelling variants (and errors). Thus
few extraction errors have high influence on the pre-
cision. This problem can be easily overcome by pre-
generating a list of alphanumeric expressions and
their variations. The negation at phase 4 was recog-
nised with high accuracy.
At phase 5 all scope problems for blood sugar re-
lated expressions are resolved successfully except
for one. The interval describing the value of the
blood sugar was written as ”oT 12 mmoiT/ir Ao 14
mmol/l” (from 12 mmol/l to 14 mmol/l) instead of
”from 12 to 14 mmol/l” like all such examples in
the training set. This lead to wrongly recognised
right border and only partial recognition of the blood
sugar level value. However this issue could be eas-
ily overcome by extending the recognition rules with
additional ”cosmetic” clauses for processing of al-
phanumeric values as suggested above. It would be
helpful for recognition of any symptom to add new
lexical alternations and paraphrases in addtion to the
stemmed forms in the regex. Our approach is com-
pletely driven by the training set analysis because
our goal is to see how far do we get on that base.
The extension of the rules as shown on figure 1
helped identifying blood sugar descriptions twice.
We believe that such extensions in feature will have
higher impact on a larger scale experiment.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999748">
We proposed a unified approach to the recogni-
tion of medical descriptions with composite mean-
ing, which are represented by a wide range of para-
phrases in the free EHR texts in Bulgarian. The re-
sults show a relatively high precision in identifying
health condition descriptions in the EHR texts. This
was achieved with the use of shallow rules and mi-
nor additional effort to extend the rules coverage -
stemming of the source documents and adding new
meaningful links to the rules where possible. The
sentence identification task has nearly the same ac-
curacy in terms of precision when performed with a
binary J48 classifier and with the rule-based phase 1
analysis even without incorporating key terms in the
classification. These results give an insight into the
possibilities of a further usage of automatic classifi-
cation for such tasks, due to its flexibility.
As a follow up to this study we will try to gener-
alise this algorithm to a more abstract level so that
it can be transferable for the identification of other
health conditions, medication etc. We will also put
effort in the automatic extraction of symptom identi-
fication rules by analysing the classification predic-
tions and the corresponding document feature vec-
tors.

<abstract confidence="0.987636933333333">This paper discusses a method for identifying diabetes symptoms and conditions in free text electronic health records in Bulgarian. The main challenge is to automatically recognise phrases and paraphrases for which no ”canonical forms” exist in any dictionary. The focus is on extracting blood sugar level and body weight change which are some of the dominant factors when diagnosing diabetes. A combined machine-learning and rule-based approach is applied. The experiment is performed on 2031 sentences of diabetes case history. The F-measure varies between 60 and 96% in the separate processing phases.</abstract>

Negation is one of the most important features to be recognized in medical texts. There is a work for Bulgarian by Boytcheva (2005) which specifically tackles the negation by the presence of triggering expression as we do too. Many systems implement isolated condition identification and rarely complete semantic model of all conditions, e.g. MedLEE (Friedman, 1994), MEDSYNDIKATE (Hahn, 2002) etc. identify the status condition and also modifying information like anatomic location, negation, change over time. In Boytcheva et al. (2010) the authors extract from Bulgarian EHRs the status of the patient skin, limbs, and neck with thyroid gland with high accuracy. 3 Experimental Data Source Data This work is done on free text EHRs of diabetic patients submitted by the Endocrinology Hospital of the Medical University in Sofia. The health conditions are written in the case history which describes the diabetes development, complications, their corresponding treatment, etc. Symptom descriptions are written within a single sentence (sometimes other symptoms are described in the same sentence too) as shown in table 1.

We employ ML techniques and rule-based analysis and in addition deal with negation detection. Harkema et al. (2009) presents an algorithm called ConText, which determines whether clinical conditions mentioned in clinical reports are negated, hypothetical, historical, or experienced by someone other than the patient. The system is entirely rulebased and infers the status of a condition from simple lexical clues occurring in the context of the condition. This algorithm proves successful in processing different clinical report types with F-measure for negation (75-95%), historical (22-84%), hypothetical (86-96%) and experiencer (100%) depending on the report types. Our work rests on a similar idea – we prepar</context>

In Bulgarian EHRs laboratory data is sometimes present inline in the text only and means for extracting such information from the plain text message are often needed. The paper is structured as follows: section 2 presents related studies, section 4 describes the method, and section 3 the experiments. The results are given in section 5 and the conclusion in section 6. 2 Related Work There are several successful systems for identifying patient characteristics and health conditions, mostly in English documents. The one presented by Savova et al. (2008) solves the task of identifying the smoking status of patients by accurately classifying individual sentences from the patient records. They achieve F-measure 85.57. One of the limitations is the lack of negation detection. Similarly to their approach our source documents are decomposed into sentences which are to be classified.
