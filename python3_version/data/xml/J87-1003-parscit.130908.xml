English is shown to be trans-context-free on the basis of coordinations of the respectively type that involve
strictly syntactic cross-serial agreement. The agreement in question involves number in nouns and reflex-
ive pronouns and is syntactic rather than semantic in nature because grammatical number in English, like
grammatical gender in languages such as French, is partly arbitrary. The formal proof, which makes crucial
use of the Interchange Lemma of Ogden et al., is so constructed as to be valid even if English is presumed
to contain grammatical sentences in which respectively operates across a pair of coordinate phrases one of
whose members has fewer conjuncts than the other; it thus goes through whatever the facts may be
regarding constructions with unequal numbers of conjuncts in the scope of respectively, whereas other argu-
ments have foundered on this problem.

Pullum and Gazdar (1982) systematically review and
critique a large number of arguments for trans-context-
freeness of natural languages,&apos; finding each one defective
conceptually, empirically, or mathematically. Among
these are various ones (e.g., that of Bar-Hillel and Shamir
(1960)2) appealing to the existence in English of
sentences like

Pullum (1984) cites a number of more recent arguments,
involving languages other than English, which do appear
to establish their trans-context-freeness and remarks (p.
117), in connection with a suggestion regarding Swedish
gender agreement, that if this type of agreement can be
shown to be a purely syntactic matter, then sentences
analogous to English instances of the schema The N, N,
... and N are respectively A, A ... and A&apos;, might provide
the basis of an argument for trans-context-freeness of
the language (or of any other with similar facts). Ih this
paper, we shall produce a rigorous argument along
comparable lines to show that English is trans-context-
free (trans-CF), though we shall rely on facts regarding
grammatical number rather than gender.
The relevance of a strictly negative result such as the
one we have obtained is not restricted to the narrow
question of where natural languages do (or don&apos;t) place
in the Chomsky hierarchy. Given that proving the trans-

context-freeness of particular natural languages has
turned out to be considerably more difficult than anyone
had expected it to be, and that solutions to difficult prob-
lems are likely to bear fruit outside the parochial confines
of the original problem area and to call attention to hith-
erto unnoticed facts, an exercise such as this goes well
beyond lily gilding or dead horse beating. To develop
our argument, for example, we shall turn the spotlight on
the linguistics phenomenon of arbitrary number, some-
thing which is rarely mentioned in standard treatment of
grammatical phenomena (in vivid contrast to arbitrary
gender), but which turns out to be more than a mere
curiosity.
The mathematical approach that we employ is also
noteworthy in making crucial use of the Interchange
Lemma for CFLs (Ogden et al. 1985) and of a &amp;quot;sepa-
ration&amp;quot; technique that allows trans-context-freeness to
be demonstrated by showing that certain strings are
included in a language while others are excluded.
Neither of these has, to our knowledge, been used in a
natural language context before. The interest of the
separation method in particular lies in the way in which it
simplifies the following problem. Since natural languages
are large, complex, and (most important) lacking in ante-
cedent definitions, the only practical way to argue about
their mathematical properties is to examine sublanguages.
If one is not careful, however, one runs the risk of
committing the &amp;quot;trickle-up&amp;quot; fallacy, which consists in
showing that a certain set S has a property P and then
attributing P to some proper superset of S. The usual
way of circumventing this difficulty is to capitalize on
closure properties of languages under intersection with a
regular set; the separation technique provides an alterna-
tive in cases where appeal to such closure properties is
not sufficient (or at least not obviously so).
Partly in the interest of a terminology free of English
bias, we call constructions like (1) simultaneous-distribu-
tive (SD) coordinations. This label reflects the fact that a
sentence such as (1) can be &amp;quot;unpacked&amp;quot; to yield, salva
veritate, a coordination of noncoordinate sentences by
means of the following procedure:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9984992">
• first, put a copy of the verb directly before each NP in
the second coordinate phrase that is not already imme-
diately preceded by a verb, thus creating a coordination
of VPs;
• then &amp;quot;distribute&amp;quot; the NPs in the first coordinate phrase
among the VPs by simultaneously associating a copy of
each of the former with exactly one of the latter, name-
ly the one in the corresponding positions;
• finally, suppress the first coordinate phrase, the first

1 MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES FOR ESTABLISHING
TRANS-CONTEXT-FREENESS
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.96311">
We shall rely here on a number of established mathemat-
ical results which, taken together, give us a way of estab-
lishing trans-context-freeness for a language with certain
syntactic properties.
Theorem 1 (Bar-Hillel et al. 1961)
The set of context-free languages is closed under
homomorphism.
Theorem 2 (Interchange Lemma, Ogden et al.
1985)
Let L be a CFL, and let L,„ be the set of length n
strings in L. Then there is a constant CL such that
for any n, any nonempty subset Q,, of L,,, and any
integer m such that n &gt; m &gt; 2, the following holds:
Let k = 1-11 0, /(CO2)1 , where rx1 denotes x
rounded up to the nearest integer, and II Q, II is the
cardinality of Q. Then there are k distinct strings
z1, zk in Q,, such that z, can be written w, xyi
for 1 &lt; i &lt; k, and:

<equation confidence="0.8813614">
(i) I w, = I wil for all i, j k;
(ii) I y, I = Iyi I for all i, j &lt; k;

(v) w,• xi y, E L for all i, j, &lt; k.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999746739130435">
Since this result is likely to be unfamiliar to some readers,
we shall provide some commentary that should prove
helpful in following the remainder of the presentation.
Less forbiddingly stated, the Interchange Lemma says
(in part) that in a CFL it is possible, for any n, to find at
least two strings of length n with internal parts of the
same length that can be exchanged for each other to
produce strings that are also in L, providing that there
are at least two distinct strings of length n. This makes it
possible to prove the trans-context-freeness of a certain
kind of language (what kind will be stated in a moment)
by showing that once n become sufficiently large, the
possibility of interchange no longer exists. For this strat-
egy to work, it is required that the cardinality of L,, grow
very rapidly as a function of n, which we can illustrate
with the case of the copying language over the vocabu-
lary {a, b} (call this language CP): For every n &lt; 2,
II CPn II = 202, thus growing exponentially, while Ccpn2
grows only polynomially; the necessary conditions for
use of the Interchange Lemma to prove trans-context-
freeness are thus satisfied by this case.
Making use of the Interchange Lemma, we have
proved the following further result:

trans-CF if I is a superset of H and a subset of G U

Theorem 4.
Let G, H, and I be as defined in Theorem 3, and let
J = ixy XE fa, bi *, y c lc, *, lxi = ly 1 I
and K = J — H. Then any set L containing H and
disjoint from K is trans-CF.
Proof: Intersect L with the regular set H = {xy I X
E {a, b} *, y lc, cl} *1 and let N = L n m. H is a
subset of N, K is disjoint from N, and the only
other strings that might be in N are those in G.
Therefore, N contains H and some subset (possibly
empty) of G, and is trans-CF by Theorem 3. Since
the intersection of any CFL with any regular set is
CF, L is trans-CF.II
Theorem 4 says that an arbitrary language L is
trans-CF if it meets the following conditions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.93536775">
• It includes H.
• It excludes every string not in H that is nonetheless
divisible into two equal parts, the first over fa, bi
and the second over {c, c/}. (This is the set K.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998949705882353">
In order to apply these results, we sill actually
need to consider not quite the sets G through N as
defined above but the corresponding sets G&apos; through
N&apos;, where the latter differ from the former in includ-
ing only strings whose x and y parts are of at least
length 2. The subtraction of a finite subset obviously
changes nothing essential, and Theorems 3 and 4 will
hold, mutatis mutandis, of sets G&apos; through N&apos;.
Hence:
Theorem 5.
Let H&apos; and K&apos; be as defined above. Then any set
L&apos; containing H&apos; and disjoint from K&apos; is trans-CF.
Our strategy in applying these results to English will be
to show that there is a subset F of English that can be
homomorphically mapped to some L&apos;, and that F is the
intersection of English with a regular language. This
suffices to show that English itself is trans-CF.

2 GRAMMATICAL NUMBER AGREEMENT IN ENGLISH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988525">
Our empirical argument rests on the claim that number
agreement between reflexive pronouns and their antece-
dents is a syntactic phenomenon in English. For exam-
ple, the string

must be considered ungrammatical rather than merely
semantically ill-formed by virtue of the impossibility
(because of number incompatibility) of supplying an
intraclausal antecedent for the reflexive pronoun. The
reason that this is so has to do with a fact about gram-
matical number in English that has not been generally
recognized; namely, that it is, like grammatical gender in
languages such as French and German, partly arbitrary.
This can be shown by a number of different kinds of
examples, among them the following. First, there are
synonym pairs in English, each consisting of a grammat-
ically singular member and a grammatically plural one. A
partial list is given in the table below.3

* a mountain range in Central Asia
** as used in the garment trade
Further, these examples can be elaborated in various
ways. For example, names of some mountain ranges are
strictly singular (Caucasus, Hindu Kush), while those of
others are strictly plural (Alps, Rockies); items from simi-
lar semantic fields may vary as to their grammatical
number properties (compare odds-probability, wheat-oats,
yoghurt-curds, pasta-noodles, mush-grits (in some
dialects), Granola-Rice Krispies). Note further that there
is dialect variation regarding the grammatical number of
certain collective nouns (such as government and
company), which are strictly singular in American
English, but which can be used as plurals in British
English.
A further phenomenon on which we shall capitalize is
the existence in English of an idiomatic way of express-
ing the ease with which an activity can be performed
involving the use of reflexive constructions, as illustrated
by, for example, This land will rent itself, or These woods
will sell themselves. With this in mind, compare now
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982425">

itself and sell themselves respectively.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989">
It is clear that strings like (3), in which each reflexive
pronoun agrees with the corresponding noun, are gram-
matical, while those in (4), in which each pronoun disa-
grees with the corresponding noun, are not. This fact
will be the basis of our demonstration that English is
trans-CF.

Let A = {{this land, these woods} and {this land, these
woods} ÷ can be expected to {{rent, sell} [itself,

respectively}, and note that A is regular. Now let B be the
subset of A that satisfies the following condition:
Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 1-2, January-June 1987 27
Michael B. Kac, Alexis Manaster-Ramer, William C. Rounds Simultaneous-Distributive Coordination and Context-Freeness
In case the number of occurrences of members of
{this land, these woods} is equal to the number of
occurrences of members of {itself, themselves}, then
for all i &gt; 1, if the ith noun in the string is land,
then the ith pronoun is itself and if the ith noun is
woods, then the ith pronoun is themselves (i.e.,
number agreement obtains between the nouns and
the reflexive pronouns).
Now let C = A — B. Every string in C contains exactly
as many pronouns as it does nouns, but for some i &gt; 1,
the ith pronoun fails to agree in number with the ith
noun. Finally, let D be the subset of B consisting of just
those strings that contain exactly as many nouns as
pronouns.
It is clear that D is part of English, and that C is
disjoint from English, inasmuch as D exhibits the
required number agreement and C does not. If D were
the intersection of English with the regular set A, then
the result that English is trans-CF would follow
immediately.4 However, things are not that simple, and it
is conceivable that the intersection of English with A is
some proper superset F of D that is a subset of B (possi-
bly B itself). The point of uncertainty here is the status
of strings of A with unequal numbers of occurrences of
nouns and pronouns, such as the following:
(5) This land, these woods, and this land can be
expected to rent itself and sell themselves respec-
tively.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.645918555555556">
(6) This land and these woods can be expected to rent
itself, sell themselves, and rent itself respectively.
While it might seem that such strings are ungrammatical,
this assumption is called into question by Pullum and
Gazdar&apos;s (1982) observation that there is no syntactic
constraint in English governing the number of conjuncts
in SD-coordinations. Thus, contrary to conventional
wisdom, there are perfectly well-formed SD-co-ordina-
tions with mismatched numbers of conjuncts; for exam-

ple, The last two people in this picture live in Columbus
and Chicago respectively. This undermines a number of
older arguments that English is trans-CF that crucially
assume that grammatical SD-coordinations must have
equal numbers of conjuncts. In light of this, it may be
that strings like (5-6) are to be considered syntactically
well-formed, albeit lacking sensible interpretations, and
so an argument presupposing the contrary cannot be used
to show that English is trans-CF.
We now show that Theorems 3, 4, and 5 allow us to
get around this obstacle by, in effect, ignoring the strings
with mismatched numbers of conjuncts in constructing
our argument. If strings like (5-6) are grammatical, then
the intersection of English with the regular language A is
not the trans-CF language D but some proper superset F
thereof. Theorem 5 tells us in effect that, no matter what
its exact identity, if there is a sublanguage of English
homomorphic to H&apos; but none homomorphic to K&apos;, then
English is trans-CF. This &amp;quot;separation&amp;quot; strategy yields the
conclusion that so long as English contains D and
excludes C, it is trans-CF.
Recall now that, according to our definition, B
includes strings like (5-6), along with sentences like (3)
but, crucially, excludes (4) and all strings like it. To be
precise, B includes all strings of A which, like (3) have
exactly as many nouns as pronouns and cross-serial
number agreement, but also all strings in A that, like (5)
and (6), have more pronouns than nouns or vice versa.
In virtue of Theorem 5, we will be able to show that
English is trans-CF no matter what position we take on
the grammaticality of strings like (5-6), so long as there
are no English sentences in the subset C of A consisting
of strings in which there are as many nouns as pronouns
but at least one of the pronouns fails to agree with the
corresponding noun in the first part of the string. Thus,
the intersection of English with A is some subset F of B
that is disjoint from C; it is of no consequence whether F
is equal to all of B, or only to D, or to some proper
subset of B that is a proper superset of D.
We now define the homomorphism h such that
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.76989">
h (this land) = a
h (these woods) = b
h (itself) = c
h (themselves) d
For all z e {can be expected to, sell, rent, and,
respectively}, h(z)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.941214541666667">
This homomorphism maps F to L&apos;. Since the CFLs are
closed under homomorphism, and L&apos; is trans-CF, F is
trans-CF. And since the CFLs are also closed under
intersection with regular sets, and the intersection of
English with the regular set A has turned out to be
trans-CF, it follows that English is also trans-CF.
It should be immediately apparent that a similar strate-
gy can be applied in instances such as the one mentioned
in Section 1, where grammatical gender agreement is
involved, providing that the language in question has
instances of arbitrary gender. So, for example, we can
construct for French a sublanguage parallel to D consist-
ing of sentences like
(7) Cette nation et ce pays sont respectivement une
alliee et un associe des Etats-Unis.
&apos;This nation and this country are respectively an
ally and a partner of the United States.&apos;
In this example, we capitalize on the fact that the inani-
mate nouns nation &apos;nation&apos; and pays &apos;country&apos; belong to
different gender classes, reflected in the predicate nomi-
nals une alliee &apos;an ally&apos; and un associe &apos;a partner&apos;.5 Inver-
sion of the predicate nominals yields an ungrammatical
string, but corresponding inversion of the subjects
restores grammaticality:

4 CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999065">
We would like to close by pointing out the importance
and interest of,the following question: Given that it is
logically possible for a language to have an operator just
like English respectively except that the conjuncts to be
linked with each other are paired in center-embedding
rather than cross-serial fashion, and given that the prop-
erties of such an operator can be characterized by formal
apparatus apparently more elementary than what is
required to characterize respectively, why do operators of
this seemingly more elementary type appear not to exist
in any natural language? The use of apparently is impor-
tant here: from the standpoint of the Chomsky hierarchy,
nesting is less complex than mutual intercalation, in the
sense that the type of grammar required to handle the
former is more restricted than the type required to handle
the latter, but the possibility is always open that this type
of complexity is not germane to human psychological
capacity. We strongly suspect that this is the case (see
Manaster-Ramer and Kac 1985), though that is a topic
for another time.

proof of Claim 1 below), and let m = n. Let k =
r Q2,0/(C1(2n)2)1 be the number defined in the

sion of the lemma. Our result will follow from the next
two claims:

Proof of Claim 1. Suppose that all the x, were equal. By
(iii) of the Interchange Lemma, I x, I &gt; n/2. Therefore,
at least n/4 characters from the x, are in the fa, bj half
or in the fc, dj half of z,. We may assume the former
possibility since the argument works exactly the same
way in the latter case. Each z, is determined by the n
characters of its a, bj half and, by supposition, at least
n/4 of these characters are fixed. So there can be at most
2n-n/4 = 23n/4 strings z1, zk. But II = and if n

contradict the Interchange Lemma, which says that all
the z&apos;s are distinct. Note that n can always be chosen this
way, no matter what C1 is, by elementary inequalities
from college algebra and calculus.
Proof of Claim 2. Observe first that interchanging x, with
xj does not produce a string in G. The substrings x, and
x disagree in some position, which is also a position in
one half or the other of the strings z, and zj. Thus the
matching position in z, and zj (in the other half of the

NOTES
1. We use the term trans-context-free in preference to non-context-
free, to distinguish the class of languages outside the weak genera-
tive capacity of type 2 grammars.

2. This argument is reiterated in Postal (1964); however the relevance
of SD-coordination to the question of context-freeness was evident-
ly first noticed in 1959 by Ray Solomonoff in personal communi-
cation to Chomsky (see Chomsky 1963).
3. Some of these examples were suggested to us by Rosemarie Whit-
ney.
4. See, for example, the argument, due to H. Brandt Corstius, cited in
Levelt (1974: 31-32).
5. These nouns were selected because they have counterparts of the
opposite gender: thus, corresponding to alliee we have allie, and
corresponding to associe we have assodee. The masculine and femi-
nine forms of &apos;partner&apos; and &apos;ally&apos; are phonologically indistinguish-
able in isolation, but can be distinguished in the context of
preceding indefinite articles, as our examples show.

The use of apparently is important here: from the standpoint of the Chomsky hierarchy, nesting is less complex than mutual intercalation, in the sense that the type of grammar required to handle the former is more restricted than the type required to handle the latter, but the possibility is always open that this type of complexity is not germane to human psychological capacity. We strongly suspect that this is the case (see Manaster-Ramer and Kac 1985), though that is a topic for another time.

To develop our argument, for example, we shall turn the spotlight on the linguistics phenomenon of arbitrary number, something which is rarely mentioned in standard treatment of grammatical phenomena (in vivid contrast to arbitrary gender), but which turns out to be more than a mere curiosity. The mathematical approach that we employ is also noteworthy in making crucial use of the Interchange Lemma for CFLs (Ogden et al. 1985) and of a &amp;quot;separation&amp;quot; technique that allows trans-context-freeness to be demonstrated by showing that certain strings are included in a language while others are excluded. Neither of these has, to our knowledge, been used in a natural language context before. The interest of the separation method in particular lies in the way in which it simplifies the following problem. Since natural languages are large, complex, and (most important) lacking in antecedent definitions, the only practical way to argue about their mathematical properties is to examine sublanguages. If one is not careful, howeve</context>

Theorem 1 (Bar-Hillel et al. 1961) The set of context-free languages is closed under homomorphism. Theorem 2 (Interchange Lemma, Ogden et al. 1985) Let L be a CFL, and let L,„ be the set of length n strings in L. Then there is a constant CL such that for any n, any nonempty subset Q,, of L,,, and any integer m such that n &gt; m &gt; 2, the following holds: Let k = 1-11 0, /(CO2)1 , where rx1 denotes x rounded up to the nearest integer, and II Q, II is the cardinality of Q. Then there are k distinct strings z1, zk in Q,, such that z, can be written w, xyi for 1 &lt; i &lt; k, and: (i) I w, = I wil for all i, j k; (ii) I y, I = Iyi I for all i, j &lt; k; (iii) m I x, I &gt; m/2; (iv) I x11 = I xj I for all i, j &lt; k; and (v) w,• xi y, E L for all i, j, &lt; k.</context>
