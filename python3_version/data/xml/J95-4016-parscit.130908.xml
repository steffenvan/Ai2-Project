Highly respected for its sustained excellence
in quality of scholarship, Linguistic Inquiry
leads the field in research on current topics
in linguistic theory. Issue after issue, L/
keeps you informed of new theoretical
developments by presenting the latest in
international research.
The Linguistic Inquiry Index is a four-part
collection of subjects, languages, authors,
and article titles from Volumes 1-19 of
Linguistic Inquiry. Compiled and reviewed
by linguists, designed for the researcher,
the L/ Index is an invaluable tool that encom-
passes all the important concepts of linguistics
and allows you to target relevant articles from
over 75 issues of Linguistic Inquiry.

THE MINIMALIST
PROGRAM
Noam Chomsky
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.937648857142857">
The Minimalist Program consists of
four recent essays that attempt to
situate linguistic theory in the
broader cognitive sciences. Building
on the theory of principles and
parameters, the minimalist frame-
work takes Universal Grammar as
providing a unique computational
system, with derivations driven by
morphological properties, to which
the syntactic variation of languages is
also restricted.

English Syntax is an authoritative, self-

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99348875">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.757975">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9937948125">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.
