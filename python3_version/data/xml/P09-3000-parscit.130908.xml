Welcome to the ACL-IJCNLP 2009 Student Research Workshop! The Student Research Workshop
is now an established tradition at ACL conferences and provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to present their
work and receive feedback. This year we received a total of 25 submissions coming from 15 different
countries, and accepted 12 of them. 5 will be presented orally, and 7 as posters, during a common
poster session with the main conference. A total of 43 students and senior researchers agreed to serve
on the program committee, which allowed us to assign 3 reviewers per paper. We would like to thank
the reviewers for understanding the spirit of the Student Research Workshop and giving careful and
constructive reviews. We hope their comments will be helpful to all the students who submitted their
work. All presenters were offered travel grants to assist them in their travel to Singapore, thanks
to generous support from the U.S. National Science Foundation, The Asian Federation of Natural
Language Processing, The Nagao Fund of the AFNLP, and The Walker Fund of the Association for
Computational Linguistics.
We are very grateful to Brian Roark and Grace Ngai, our faculty advisors, for their advice, constant
support (and reminders!), and obtaining of funding. Finally, we would like to thank the general chair of
ACL-IJCNLP 2009, Keh-Yih Su, the program chairs, Jian Su and Janyce Wiebe, the publications chairs
Regina Barzilay and Jing-Shin Chang, Haizhou Li and the local organization committee, and Priscilla
Rasmussen.
