I was President in 1968, the year during
which the Association for Machine Translation and
Computational Linguistics became the Association
for Computational Linguistics. Names always
create controversy, and the founding name,
selected in 1962, was chosen in competition with
others, not the least of which was the one that
subsequently replaced it. In fact, a change of
name to the Association for Computational
Linguistics was actually approved in 1963, at what
has been described as an &amp;quot;unofficial meeting.&amp;quot;
However, that action was subsequently ruled out of
order, since it did not result from a
constitutional amendment. Five years later,
proper procedure having been followed, the change
was made officially.
The organizational impetus for the
establishment of the Association did came
primarily from a group of people who had been
working on machine translation. However, as in
most scientific societies, there has always been--
and probably always will be--a tension between
research and applications. The primary motivation
for the name change in 1968 was the recognition,
shared but by no means universal, that we needed
to address more basic issues first. The report on
Language and Machines: Computers in Translation
and Linguistics by the Automatic Language
Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) in 1966
became a focal point for this controversy. It was
viewed by translation specialists as an attack on
their work, and it certainly resulted in dramatic
reductions in funding for machine translation.
However, its authors claim it was intended as an
argument for increased support of research.
Certainly, the lead article in the October-
November 1966 issue of The Finite String, which
was titled &amp;quot;Potential Bright for Language-Analysis
by Computer; NRC Report Urges Support,&amp;quot; presented
that view. In any case, the argument that
computational linguistics &amp;quot;should be supported as
a science and should not be judged by any
immediate or foreseeable contributions to
practical translation&amp;quot; seemed to frighten rather
than challenge the funding agencies in the
immediately following years.
Another factor motivating the change of name
in 1968 was the appreciation of the potential for
the use of computation.&apos; linguistics in
information retrieval and in stylistic analysis.
&amp;quot;-..tanical translation was only one of a number of
exciting application areas. During that year, I
spent a substantial amount of time coordinating
with the Special Interest Group on Information
Retrieval (SIGIR) and the Special Interest
Committee on Language Analysis and Studies in the
Humanities (SICLASH), both of the Association for
Computing Machinery, and with the Special Interest
Group on Automated Language Processing (SIGALP) of
the American Society for Information Science.
There were also meetings with the Linguistic
Society of America, the Modern Language
Association, and the Center for Applied
Linguistics. In addition, during the year, ACL
became a constituent society of the American
Federation of Information Processing Societies
(AFIPS), of which it had been first an unofficial
and then an official &amp;quot;observer&amp;quot; since 1964. I was
the first ACL member of the Board of Directors,
and I became actively involved in a number of its
committees, most particularly the one on
Information Systems. I also became the ACL
representative to the newly formed International
Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and,
subsequently, Program Chairman of its first
meeting in 1969.
These organizational relationships, coupled
with my own tendency toward global perspectives,
led me to view the ACL as a central point around
which everything else revolved. In computational
linguistics, there are aspects of science,
engineering, the humanities, the social and
behavioral sciences, education, and
communications. I contemplated the time when, in
addition to being members of AFIPS, our
Association would be equally implicated in the
American Association for the Advancement of
Science, the American Council of Learned
Societies, and the Social Science Research
Council. And I only regretted that at that time
there were no aggregate groups for education, and
communications to round out the picture.
This &amp;quot;message&amp;quot; was the substance of my
Presidential address. I tried to leaven it with a
little humor to make it more palatable, but I
remember the banquet which preceded it (prepared
by the University of Illinois Illini Union) as the
most horrible meal the ACL has ever had to
confront. I am sure that the failure of the
members attendant to rally to my cause and carry
my message to the multitudes (or even to Garcia)
was due in no small measure to the poor quality of
the food.
But let me return briefly to name changes and
to the tension between research and applications.
During our discussions about the forthcoming
Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing,
which the ACL will be cosponsoring with the Naval
Research Laboratory, 1-3 February 1983, in Santa

Monica, we considered calling it &amp;quot;Conference on
Applied Computational Linguistics.&amp;quot; However, it
became clear that we could not expect to have as
broadly based a meeting as we wanted with that
name. It is important now to reach out to the
larger community. Once we have them listening to
us, it will be all right for them to find out that
they have been &amp;quot;practicing computational
linguistics all their (professional) lives!&amp;quot;
Fascinated as I am about the applicability of
computational linguistics for its own sake, what I
find most exciting is the value that the use of
our systems will have for deepening our insights
into the basic research issues that still face us.
I believe that studying people &amp;quot;organizing and
using information&amp;quot; on the kinds of systems we are
now beginning to develop can revolutionize our
understanding of what we do and do not know about
computational linguistics, as well as guide the
improvement of our systems more effectively
