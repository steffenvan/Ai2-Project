Kuwait University is currently compiling an extensive
bibliography in the areas of Computational Linguistics
and Artificial Intelligence. The bibliography is meant to
be of value particularly to universities and research
centers that, like KU, are planning to start research and
teaching in these areas. It will assist them to base their
planning on state-of-the-art information in the field and
to be aware of available resources.
The bibliography will include information on books,
journals, published papers, technical reports, educational
tools, and systems.
We would appreciate information on any of the above
categories, particularly on technical reports, tools for
research, and systems. Information on systems should
include: purpose of system, name(s) of designer(s), tech-
nical features, limitations, programming language, hard-
ware requirements, and availability for educational
institutions.
The bibliography will be published at the end of 1987.
It may also be available on line through the European
Academic Network.

ANNOUNCEMENTS
COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992365">
Academic Press has announced this new journal, which
commenced publication in March 1986. The purpose of
the journal is to publish reports of original research
related to quantitative descriptions of the recognition,
understanding, production, and coding of speech by
humans and/or machines.
The speech sciences have a long history, but it is only
fairly recently that experimentation with complex models
of speech processes has become feasible. At present
such research is carried out somewhat separately by prac-
titioners of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science,
Electronic Engineering, Linguistics, Phonetics, and
Psychology. Appropriate areas of investigation include
the use of constructive mathematical analyses, computer
simulation, algorithms for pattern analysis, syntactic and
linguistic structures, the establishment of models of
human performance, and the use of computers in meas-
urements.
The journal will aim to provide a focus for this work
and to encourage an interdisciplinary approach to prob-
lems in the speech sciences. Thus, contributions from all
of the related disciplines will be welcomed in the form of
reports of theoretical or experimental studies, tutorials,
and brief correspondence pertaining to models of speech
communication and their implementation, or fundamental
research leading to the improvement of such models.
