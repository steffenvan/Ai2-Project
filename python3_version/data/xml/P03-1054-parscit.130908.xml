Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.964831055555556">
We demonstrate that an unlexicalized PCFG can
parse much more accurately than previously shown,
by making use of simple, linguistically motivated
state splits, which break down false independence
assumptions latent in a vanilla treebank grammar.
Indeed, its performance of 86.36% (LP/LR F1) is
better than that of early lexicalized PCFG models,
and surprisingly close to the current state-of-the-
art. This result has potential uses beyond establish-
ing a strong lower bound on the maximum possi-
ble accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexical-
ized PCFG is much more compact, easier to repli-
cate, and easier to interpret than more complex lex-
ical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler,
more widely understood, of lower asymptotic com-
plexity, and easier to optimize.
In the early 1990s, as probabilistic methods swept
NLP, parsing work revived the investigation of prob-
abilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) (Booth and
Thomson, 1973; Baker, 1979). However, early re-
sults on the utility of PCFGs for parse disambigua-
tion and language modeling were somewhat disap-
pointing. A conviction arose that lexicalized PCFGs
(where head words annotate phrasal nodes) were
the key tool for high performance PCFG parsing.
This approach was congruent with the great success
of word n-gram models in speech recognition, and
drew strength from a broader interest in lexicalized
grammars, as well as demonstrations that lexical de-
pendencies were a key tool for resolving ambiguities
such as PP attachments (Ford et al., 1982; Hindle and
Rooth, 1993). In the following decade, great success
in terms of parse disambiguation and even language
modeling was achieved by various lexicalized PCFG
models (Magerman, 1995; Charniak, 1997; Collins,
1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak, 2001).
However, several results have brought into ques-
tion how large a role lexicalization plays in such
parsers. Johnson (1998) showed that the perfor-
mance of an unlexicalized PCFG over the Penn tree-
bank could be improved enormously simply by an-
notating each node by its parent category. The Penn
treebank covering PCFG is a poor tool for parsing be-
cause the context-freedom assumptions it embodies
are far too strong, and weakening them in this way
makes the model much better. More recently, Gildea
(2001) discusses how taking the bilexical probabil-
ities out of a good current lexicalized PCFG parser
hurts performance hardly at all: by at most 0.5% for
test text from the same domain as the training data,
and not at all for test text from a different domain.1
But it is precisely these bilexical dependencies that
backed the intuition that lexicalized PCFGs should be
very successful, for example in Hindle and Rooth’s
demonstration from PP attachment. We take this as a
reflection of the fundamental sparseness of the lex-
ical dependency information available in the Penn
Treebank. As a speech person would say, one mil-
lion words of training data just isn’t enough. Even
for topics central to the treebank’s Wall Street Jour-
nal text, such as stocks, many very plausible depen-
dencies occur only once, for example stocks stabi-
lized, while many others occur not at all, for exam-
ple stocks skyrocketed.2
The best-performing lexicalized PCFGs have in-
creasingly made use of subcategorization3 of the
1There are minor differences, but all the current best-known
lexicalized PCFGs employ both monolexical statistics, which
describe the phrasal categories of arguments and adjuncts that
appear around a head lexical item, and bilexical statistics, or de-
pendencies, which describe the likelihood of a head word taking
as a dependent a phrase headed by a certain other word.

2This observation motivates various class- or similarity-
based approaches to combating sparseness, and this remains a
promising avenue of work, but success in this area has proven
somewhat elusive, and, at any rate, current lexicalized PCFGs
do simply use exact word matches if available, and interpolate
with syntactic category-based estimates when they are not.

nal general sense of Chomsky (1965), for where a syntactic cat-

categories appearing in the Penn treebank. Charniak
(2000) shows the value his parser gains from parent-
annotation of nodes, suggesting that this informa-
tion is at least partly complementary to information
derivable from lexicalization, and Collins (1999)
uses a range of linguistically motivated and care-
fully hand-engineered subcategorizations to break
down wrong context-freedom assumptions of the
naive Penn treebank covering PCFG, such as differ-
entiating “base NPs” from noun phrases with phrasal
modifiers, and distinguishing sentences with empty
subjects from those where there is an overt subject
NP. While he gives incomplete experimental results
as to their efficacy, we can assume that these features
were incorporated because of beneficial effects on
parsing that were complementary to lexicalization.
In this paper, we show that the parsing perfor-
mance that can be achieved by an unlexicalized
PCFG is far higher than has previously been demon-
strated, and is, indeed, much higher than community
wisdom has thought possible. We describe several
simple, linguistically motivated annotations which
do much to close the gap between a vanilla PCFG
and state-of-the-art lexicalized models. Specifically,
we construct an unlexicalized PCFG which outper-
forms the lexicalized PCFGs of Magerman (1995)
and Collins (1996) (though not more recent models,
such as Charniak (1997) or Collins (1999)).
One benefit of this result is a much-strengthened
lower bound on the capacity of an unlexicalized
PCFG. To the extent that no such strong baseline has
been provided, the community has tended to greatly
overestimate the beneficial effect of lexicalization in
probabilistic parsing, rather than looking critically
at where lexicalized probabilities are both needed to
make the right decision and available in the training
data. Secondly, this result affirms the value of lin-
guistic analysis for feature discovery. The result has
other uses and advantages: an unlexicalized PCFG is
easier to interpret, reason about, and improve than
the more complex lexicalized models. The grammar
representation is much more compact, no longer re-
quiring large structures that store lexicalized proba-
bilities. The parsing algorithms have lower asymp-
totic complexity4 and have much smaller grammar

constants. An unlexicalized PCFG parser is much
simpler to build and optimize, including both stan-
dard code optimization techniques and the investiga-
tion of methods for search space pruning (Caraballo
and Charniak, 1998; Charniak et al., 1998).
It is not our goal to argue against the use of lex-
icalized probabilities in high-performance probabi-
listic parsing. It has been comprehensively demon-
strated that lexical dependencies are useful in re-
solving major classes of sentence ambiguities, and a
parser should make use of such information where
possible. We focus here on using unlexicalized,
structural context because we feel that this infor-
mation has been underexploited and underappreci-
ated. We see this investigation as only one part of
the foundation for state-of-the-art parsing which em-
ploys both lexical and structural conditioning.

To facilitate comparison with previous work, we
trained our models on sections 2–21 of the WSJ sec-
tion of the Penn treebank. We used the first 20 files
(393 sentences) of section 22 as a development set
(devset). This set is small enough that there is no-
ticeable variance in individual results, but it allowed
rapid search for good features via continually repars-
ing the devset in a partially manual hill-climb. All of
section 23 was used as a test set for the final model.
For each model, input trees were annotated or trans-
formed in some way, as in Johnson (1998). Given
a set of transformed trees, we viewed the local trees
as grammar rewrite rules in the standard way, and
used (unsmoothed) maximum-likelihood estimates
for rule probabilities.5 To parse the grammar, we
used a simple array-based Java implementation of
a generalized CKY parser, which, for our final best
model, was able to exhaustively parse all sentences
in section 23 in 1GB of memory, taking approxi-
mately 3 sec for average length sentences.6

5The tagging probabilities were smoothed to accommodate
unknown words. The quantity P(tag|word) was estimated
as follows: words were split into one of several categories
wordclass, based on capitalization, suffix, digit, and other
character features. For each of these categories, we took the
maximum-likelihood estimate of P(tag|wordclass). This dis-
tribution was used as a prior against which observed taggings,
if any, were taken, giving P(tag|word) = [c(tag, word) +
κ P(tag|wordclass)]/[c(word)+κ]. This was then inverted to
give P(word|tag). The quality of this tagging model impacts
all numbers; for example the raw treebank grammar’s devset F1
is 72.62 with it and 72.09 without it.

The traditional starting point for unlexicalized pars-
ing is the raw n-ary treebank grammar read from
training trees (after removing functional tags and
null elements). This basic grammar is imperfect in
two well-known ways. First, the category symbols
are too coarse to adequately render the expansions
independent of the contexts. For example, subject
NP expansions are very different from object NP ex-
pansions: a subject NP is 8.7 times more likely than
an object NP to expand as just a pronoun. Having
separate symbols for subject and object NPs allows
this variation to be captured and used to improve
parse scoring. One way of capturing this kind of
external context is to use parent annotation, as pre-
sented in Johnson (1998). For example, NPs with S
parents (like subjects) will be marked NP&amp;quot;S, while
NPs with VP parents (like objects) will be NP&amp;quot;VP.
The second basic deficiency is that many rule
types have been seen only once (and therefore have
their probabilities overestimated), and many rules
which occur in test sentences will never have been
seen in training (and therefore have their probabili-
ties underestimated – see Collins (1999) for analy-
sis). Note that in parsing with the unsplit grammar,
not having seen a rule doesn’t mean one gets a parse
failure, but rather a possibly very weird parse (Char-
niak, 1996). One successful method of combating
sparsity is to markovize the rules (Collins, 1999). In
particular, we follow that work in markovizing out
from the head child, despite the grammar being un-
lexicalized, because this seems the best way to cap-
ture the traditional linguistic insight that phrases are
organized around a head (Radford, 1988).
Both parent annotation (adding context) and RHS
markovization (removing it) can be seen as two in-
stances of the same idea. In parsing, every node has
a vertical history, including the node itself, parent,
grandparent, and so on. A reasonable assumption is
that only the past v vertical ancestors matter to the
current expansion. Similarly, only the previous h
horizontal ancestors matter (we assume that the head
child always matters). It is a historical accident that
the default notion of a treebank PCFG grammar takes
v = 1 (only the current node matters vertically) and
h = oc (rule right hand sides do not decompose at
all). On this view, it is unsurprising that increasing
v and decreasing h have historically helped.
As an example, consider the case of v = 1,
h = 1. If we start with the rule VP → VBZ NP
PP PP, it will be broken into several stages, each a
binary or unary rule, which conceptually represent
a head-outward generation of the right hand size, as
shown in figure 1. The bottom layer will be a unary
over the head declaring the goal: (VP: [VBZ]) →
VBZ. The square brackets indicate that the VBZ is
the head, while the angle brackets (X) indicates that
the symbol (X) is an intermediate symbol (equiv-
alently, an active or incomplete state). The next
layer up will generate the first rightward sibling of
the head child: (VP: [VBZ]... NP) → (VP: [VBZ])
NP. Next, the PP is generated: (VP: [VBZ]... PP) →
(VP: [VBZ]... NP) PP. We would then branch off left
siblings if there were any.7 Finally, we have another
unary to finish the VP. Note that while it is con-
venient to think of this as a head-outward process,
these are just PCFG rewrites, and so the actual scores
attached to each rule will correspond to a downward
generation order.
Figure 2 presents a grid of horizontal and verti-
cal markovizations of the grammar. The raw tree-
bank grammar corresponds to v = 1, h = oc (the
upper right corner), while the parent annotation in
(Johnson, 1998) corresponds to v = 2, h = oc, and
the second-order model in Collins (1999), is broadly
a smoothed version of v = 2, h = 2. In addi-
tion to exact nth-order models, we tried variable-

7In our system, the last few right children carry over as pre-
ceding context for the left children, distinct from common prac-
tice. We found this wrapped horizon to be beneficial, and it
also unifies the infinite order model with the unmarkovized raw
rules.

history models similar in intent to those described
in Ron et al. (1994). For variable horizontal his-
tories, we did not split intermediate states below 10
occurrences of a symbol. For example, if the symbol
(VP: [VBZ]... PP PP) were too rare, we would col-
lapse it to (VP: [VBZ]... PP). For vertical histories,
we used a cutoff which included both frequency and
mutual information between the history and the ex-
pansions (this was not appropriate for the horizontal
case because MI is unreliable at such low counts).
Figure 2 shows parsing accuracies as well as the
number of symbols in each markovization. These
symbol counts include all the intermediate states
which represent partially completed constituents.
The general trend is that, in the absence of further
annotation, more vertical annotation is better – even
exhaustive grandparent annotation. This is not true
for horizontal markovization, where the variable-
order second-order model was superior. The best
entry, v = 3, h &lt; 2, has an F1 of 79.74, already
a substantial improvement over the baseline.
In the remaining sections, we discuss other an-
notations which increasingly split the symbol space.
Since we expressly do not smooth the grammar, not
all splits are guaranteed to be beneficial, and not all
sets of useful splits are guaranteed to co-exist well.
In particular, while v = 3, h &lt; 2 markovization is
good on its own, it has a large number of states and
does not tolerate further splitting well. Therefore,
we base all further exploration on the v &lt; 2, h &lt; 2

3 External vs. Internal Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999719375">
The two major previous annotation strategies, par-
ent annotation and head lexicalization, can be seen
as instances of external and internal annotation, re-
spectively. Parent annotation lets us indicate an
important feature of the external environment of a
node which influences the internal expansion of that
node. On the other hand, lexicalization is a (radi-
cal) method of marking a distinctive aspect of the
otherwise hidden internal contents of a node which
influence the external distribution. Both kinds of an-
notation can be useful. To identify split states, we
add suffixes of the form -X to mark internal content
features, and &amp;quot;X to mark external features.
To illustrate the difference, consider unary pro-
ductions. In the raw grammar, there are many unar-
ies, and once any major category is constructed over
a span, most others become constructible as well us-
ing unary chains (see Klein and Manning (2001) for
discussion). Such chains are rare in real treebank
trees: unary rewrites only appear in very specific
contexts, for example S complements of verbs where
the S has an empty, controlled subject. Figure 4
shows an erroneous output of the parser, using the
baseline markovized grammar. Intuitively, there are
several reasons this parse should be ruled out, but
one is that the lower S slot, which is intended pri-
marily for S complements of communication verbs,
is not a unary rewrite position (such complements
usually have subjects). It would therefore be natural
to annotate the trees so as to confine unary produc-
tions to the contexts in which they are actually ap-
propriate. We tried two annotations. First, UNARY-

INTERNAL marks (with a -U) any nonterminal node
which has only one child. In isolation, this resulted
in an absolute gain of 0.55% (see figure 3). The
same sentence, parsed using only the baseline and
UNARY-INTERNAL, is parsed correctly, because the
VP rewrite in the incorrect parse ends with an S&amp;quot;VP-
U with very low probability.8
Alternately, UNARY-EXTERNAL, marked nodes
which had no siblings with &amp;quot;U. It was similar to
UNARY-INTERNAL in solo benefit (0.01% worse),
but provided far less marginal benefit on top of
other later features (none at all on top of UNARY-
INTERNAL for our top models), and was discarded.9
One restricted place where external unary annota-
tion was very useful, however, was at the pretermi-
nal level, where internal annotation was meaning-
less. One distributionally salient tag conflation in
the Penn treebank is the identification of demonstra-
tives (that, those) and regular determiners (the, a).
Splitting DT tags based on whether they were only
children (UNARY-DT) captured this distinction. The
same external unary annotation was even more ef-
fective when applied to adverbs (UNARY-RB), dis-
tinguishing, for example, as well from also). Be-
yond these cases, unary tag marking was detrimen-
tal. The F1 after UNARY-INTERNAL, UNARY-DT,
and UNARY-RB was 78.86%.

The idea that part-of-speech tags are not fine-grained
enough to abstract away from specific-word be-
haviour is a cornerstone of lexicalization. The
UNARY-DT annotation, for example, showed that the
determiners which occur alone are usefully distin-
guished from those which occur with other nomi-
nal material. This marks the DT nodes with a single
bit about their immediate external context: whether
there are sisters. Given the success of parent anno-
tation for nonterminals, it makes sense to parent an-
notate tags, as well (TAG-PA). In fact, as figure 3
shows, exhaustively marking all preterminals with
their parent category was the most effective single
annotation we tried. Why should this be useful?
Most tags have a canonical category. For example,
NNS tags occur under NP nodes (only 234 of 70855
do not, mostly mistakes). However, when a tag

somewhat regularly occurs in a non-canonical posi-
tion, its distribution is usually distinct. For example,
the most common adverbs directly under ADVP are
also (1599) and now (544). Under VP, they are n’t
(3779) and not (922). Under NP, only (215) and just
(132), and so on. TAG-PA brought F1 up substan-
tially, to 80.62%.
In addition to the adverb case, the Penn tag set
conflates various grammatical distinctions that are
commonly made in traditional and generative gram-
mar, and from which a parser could hope to get use-
ful information. For example, subordinating con-
junctions (while, as, if), complementizers (that, for),
and prepositions (of, in, from) all get the tag IN.
Many of these distinctions are captured by TAG-
PA (subordinating conjunctions occur under S and
prepositions under PP), but are not (both subor-
dinating conjunctions and complementizers appear
under SBAR). Also, there are exclusively noun-
modifying prepositions (of), predominantly verb-
modifying ones (as), and so on. The annotation
SPLIT-IN does a linguistically motivated 6-way split
of the IN tag, and brought the total to 81.19%.
Figure 5 shows an example error in the baseline
which is equally well fixed by either TAG-PA or
SPLIT-IN. In this case, the more common nominal
use of works is preferred unless the IN tag is anno-
tated to allow if to prefer S complements.
We also got value from three other annotations
which subcategorized tags for specific lexemes.
First we split off auxiliary verbs with the SPLIT-

5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977264705882">
Around this point, we must address exactly what we
mean by an unlexicalized PCFG. To the extent that
we go about subcategorizing POS categories, many
of them might come to represent a single word. One
might thus feel that the approach of this paper is to
walk down a slippery slope, and that we are merely
arguing degrees. However, we believe that there is a
fundamental qualitative distinction, grounded in lin-
guistic practice, between what we see as permitted
in an unlexicalized PCFG as against what one finds
and hopes to exploit in lexicalized PCFGs. The di-
vision rests on the traditional distinction between
function words (or closed-class words) and content
words (or open class or lexical words). It is stan-
dard practice in linguistics, dating back decades,
to annotate phrasal nodes with important function-
word distinctions, for example to have a CP[for]
or a PP[to], whereas content words are not part of
grammatical structure, and one would not have spe-
cial rules or constraints for an NP[stocks], for exam-
ple. We follow this approach in our model: various
closed classes are subcategorized to better represent
important distinctions, and important features com-
monly expressed by function words are annotated
onto phrasal nodes (such as whether a VP is finite,
or a participle, or an infinitive clause). However, no
use is made of lexical class words, to provide either
monolexical or bilexical probabilities.11
At any rate, we have kept ourselves honest by es-
timating our models exclusively by maximum like-
lihood estimation over our subcategorized gram-
mar, without any form of interpolation or shrink-
age to unsubcategorized categories (although we do
markovize rules, as explained above). This effec-

11It should be noted that we started with four tags in the Penn
treebank tagset that rewrite as a single word: EX (there), WP$
(whose), # (the pound sign), and TO), and some others such
as WP, POS, and some of the punctuation tags, which rewrite
as barely more. To the extent that we subcategorize tags, there
will be more such cases, but many of them already exist in other
tag sets. For instance, many tag sets, such as the Brown and
CLAWS (c5) tagsets give a separate sets of tags to each form of
the verbal auxiliaries be, do, and have, most of which rewrite as
only a single word (and any corresponding contractions).

tively means that the subcategories that we break off
must themselves be very frequent in the language.
In such a framework, if we try to annotate cate-
gories with any detailed lexical information, many
sentences either entirely fail to parse, or have only
extremely weird parses. The resulting battle against
sparsity means that we can only afford to make a few
distinctions which have major distributional impact.
Even with the individual-lexeme annotations in this
section, the grammar still has only 9255 states com-
pared to the 7619 of the baseline model.

6 Annotations Already in the Treebank
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959384615385">
At this point, one might wonder as to the wisdom
of stripping off all treebank functional tags, only
to heuristically add other such markings back in to
the grammar. By and large, the treebank out-of-the
package tags, such as PP-LOC or ADVP-TMP, have
negative utility. Recall that the raw treebank gram-
mar, with no annotation or markovization, had an F1
of 72.62% on our development set. With the func-
tional annotation left in, this drops to 71.49%. The
h &lt; 2, v &lt; 1 markovization baseline of 77.77%
dropped even further, all the way to 72.87%, when
these annotations were included.
Nonetheless, some distinctions present in the raw
treebank trees were valuable. For example, an NP
with an S parent could be either a temporal NP or a
subject. For the annotation TMP-NP, we retained the
original -TMP tags on NPs, and, furthermore, propa-
gated the tag down to the tag of the head of the NP.
This is illustrated in figure 6, which also shows an
example of its utility, clarifying that CNN last night
is not a plausible compound and facilitating the oth-
erwise unusual high attachment of the smaller NP.
TMP-NP brought the cumulative F1 to 82.25%. Note
that this technique of pushing the functional tags
down to preterminals might be useful more gener-
ally; for example, locative PPs expand roughly the

same way as all other PPs (usually as IN NP), but
they do tend to have different prepositions below IN.
A second kind of information in the original
trees is the presence of empty elements. Following
Collins (1999), the annotation GAPPED-S marks S
nodes which have an empty subject (i.e., raising and
control constructions). This brought F1 to 82.28%.

7 Head Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996326923077">
The notion that the head word of a constituent can
affect its behavior is a useful one. However, often
the head tag is as good (or better) an indicator of how
a constituent will behave.12 We found several head
annotations to be particularly effective. First, pos-
sessive NPs have a very different distribution than
other NPs – in particular, NP → NP α rules are only
used in the treebank when the leftmost child is pos-
sessive (as opposed to other imaginable uses like for
New York lawyers, which is left flat). To address this,
POSS-NP marked all possessive NPs. This brought
the total F1 to 83.06%. Second, the VP symbol is
very overloaded in the Penn treebank, most severely
in that there is no distinction between finite and in-
finitival VPs. An example of the damage this con-
flation can do is given in figure 7, where one needs
to capture the fact that present-tense verbs do not
generally take bare infinitive VP complements. To
allow the finite/non-finite distinction, and other verb
type distinctions, SPLIT-VP annotated all VP nodes
with their head tag, merging all finite forms to a sin-
gle tag VBF. In particular, this also accomplished
Charniak’s gerund-VP marking. This was extremely
useful, bringing the cumulative F1 to 85.72%, 2.66%
absolute improvement (more than its solo improve-
ment over the baseline).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.60459825">
12This is part of the explanation of why (Charniak, 2000)
finds that early generation of head tags as in (Collins, 1999)
is so beneficial. The rest of the benefit is presumably in the
availability of the tags for smoothing purposes.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.96254548">
Error analysis at this point suggested that many re-
maining errors were attachment level and conjunc-
tion scope. While these kinds of errors are undoubt-
edly profitable targets for lexical preference, most
attachment mistakes were overly high attachments,
indicating that the overall right-branching tendency
of English was not being captured. Indeed, this ten-
dency is a difficult trend to capture in a PCFG be-
cause often the high and low attachments involve the
very same rules. Even if not, attachment height is
not modeled by a PCFG unless it is somehow ex-
plicitly encoded into category labels. More com-
plex parsing models have indirectly overcome this
by modeling distance (rather than height).
Linear distance is difficult to encode in a PCFG
– marking nodes with the size of their yields mas-
sively multiplies the state space.13 Therefore, we
wish to find indirect indicators that distinguish high
attachments from low ones. In the case of two PPs
following a NP, with the question of whether the
second PP is a second modifier of the leftmost NP
or should attach lower, inside the first PP, the im-
portant distinction is usually that the lower site is a
non-recursive base NP. Collins (1999) captures this
notion by introducing the notion of a base NP, in
which any NP which dominates only preterminals is
marked with a -B. Further, if an NP-B does not have
a non-base NP parent, it is given one with a unary
production. This was helpful, but substantially less
effective than marking base NPs without introducing
the unary, whose presence actually erased a useful
internal indicator – base NPs are more frequent in
subject position than object position, for example. In
isolation, the Collins method actually hurt the base-
line (absolute cost to F1 of 0.37%), while skipping
the unary insertion added an absolute 0.73% to the
baseline, and brought the cumulative F1 to 86.04%.
In the case of attachment of a PP to an NP ei-
ther above or inside a relative clause, the high NP
is distinct from the low one in that the already mod-
ified one contains a verb (and the low one may be
a base NP as well). This is a partial explanation of
the utility of verbal distance in Collins (1999). To
13The inability to encode distance naturally in a naive PCFG
is somewhat ironic. In the heart of any PCFG parser, the funda-
mental table entry or chart item is a label over a span, for ex-
ample an NP from position 0 to position 5. The concrete use of
a grammar rule is to take two adjacent span-marked labels and
combine them (for example NP[0,5] and VP[5,12] into S[0,12]).
Yet, only the labels are used to score the combination.

mulative hill-climb.
The final distance/depth feature we used was an
explicit attempt to model depth, rather than use
distance and linear intervention as a proxy. With
RIGHT-REC-NP, we marked all NPs which contained
another NP on their right periphery (i.e., as a right-

10 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999889375">
The advantages of unlexicalized grammars are clear
enough – easy to estimate, easy to parse with, and
time- and space-efficient. However, the dismal per-
formance of basic unannotated unlexicalized gram-
mars has generally rendered those advantages irrel-
evant. Here, we have shown that, surprisingly, the
maximum-likelihood estimate of a compact unlexi-
calized PCFG can parse on par with early lexicalized
parsers. We do not want to argue that lexical se-
lection is not a worthwhile component of a state-of-
the-art parser – certain attachments, at least, require
it – though perhaps its necessity has been overstated.
Rather, we have shown ways to improve parsing,
some easier than lexicalization, and others of which
are orthogonal to it, and could presumably be used
to benefit lexicalized parsers as well.

In the early 1990s, as probabilistic methods swept parsing work revived the investigation of probcontext-free grammars (Booth and Thomson, 1973; Baker, 1979). However, early reon the utility of for parse disambiguation and language modeling were somewhat disap- A conviction arose that (where head words annotate phrasal nodes) were key tool for high performance This approach was congruent with the great success word models in speech recognition, and drew strength from a broader interest in lexicalized grammars, as well as demonstrations that lexical dependencies were a key tool for resolving ambiguities as (Ford et al., 1982; Hindle and Rooth, 1993). In the following decade, great success in terms of parse disambiguation and even language was achieved by various lexicalized models (Magerman, 1995; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak, 2001). However, several results have brought into question how large a role lexicalization plays in such parsers. Johnson (1998) showed that the perforof an the Penn treebank could be improved enormously simply by annotating each node by its parent category. The Penn covering a poor tool for parsing because the context-freedom assumptions it embodies are far too strong, and weakening them in this way makes the model much better. More recently, Gildea discusses how taking the probabilout of a good current lexicalized hurts performance hardly at all: by at most 0.5% for test text from the same domain as the training data, not at all for test text from a different But it is precisely these bilexical dependencies that the intuition that lexicalized should be very successful, for example in Hindle and Rooth’s from We take this as a reflection of the fundamental sparseness of the lexical dependency information available in the Penn Treebank. As a speech person would say, one million words of training data just isn’t enough. Even topics central to the treebank’s Street Joursuch as stocks, many very plausible depenoccur only once, for example stabiwhile many others occur not at all, for exambest-performing lexicalized have inmade use of of the are minor differences, but all the current best-known employ both which describe the phrasal categories of arguments and adjuncts that around a head lexical item, and or dependencies, which describe the likelihood of a head word taking as a dependent a phrase headed by a certain other word. observation motivates various classor similaritybased approaches to combating sparseness, and this remains a promising avenue of work, but success in this area has proven elusive, and, at any rate, current lexicalized do simply use exact word matches if available, and interpolate with syntactic category-based estimates when they are not. this paper we use the term the origigeneral sense of Chomsky (1965), for where a syntactic catcategories appearing in the Penn treebank. Charniak (2000) shows the value his parser gains from parentannotation of nodes, suggesting that this information is at least partly complementary to information derivable from lexicalization, and Collins (1999) uses a range of linguistically motivated and carefully hand-engineered subcategorizations to break down wrong context-freedom assumptions of the Penn treebank covering such as differ- “base from noun phrases with phrasal modifiers, and distinguishing sentences with empty subjects from those where there is an overt subject While he gives incomplete experimental results as to their efficacy, we can assume that these features were incorporated because of beneficial effects on parsing that were complementary to lexicalization. In this paper, we show that the parsing performance that can be achieved by an unlexicalized far higher than has previously been demonstrated, and is, indeed, much higher than community wisdom has thought possible. We describe several simple, linguistically motivated annotations which much to close the gap between a vanilla and state-of-the-art lexicalized models. Specifically, construct an outperthe of Magerman (1995) and Collins (1996) (though not more recent models, such as Charniak (1997) or Collins (1999)). One benefit of this result is a much-strengthened lower bound on the capacity of an unlexicalized To the extent that no such strong baseline has been provided, the community has tended to greatly overestimate the beneficial effect of lexicalization in probabilistic parsing, rather than looking critically where lexicalized probabilities are both the right decision and the training data. Secondly, this result affirms the value of linguistic analysis for feature discovery. The result has uses and advantages: an unlexicalized easier to interpret, reason about, and improve than the more complex lexicalized models. The grammar representation is much more compact, no longer requiring large structures that store lexicalized probabilities. The parsing algorithms have lower asympand have much smaller grammar egory is divided into several subcategories, for example dividing verb phrases into finite and non-finite verb phrases, rather than in the modern restricted usage where the term refers only to the syntactic argument frames of predicators. a naive implementation, or vs. if using the clever approach of Eisner and Satta (1999). An unlexicalized is much simpler to build and optimize, including both standard code optimization techniques and the investigation of methods for search space pruning (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998; Charniak et al., 1998). is goal to argue against the use of lexicalized probabilities in high-performance probabilistic parsing. It has been comprehensively demonstrated that lexical dependencies are useful in resolving major classes of sentence ambiguities, and a parser should make use of such information where possible. We focus here on using unlexicalized, structural context because we feel that this information has been underexploited and underappreciated. We see this investigation as only one part of the foundation for state-of-the-art parsing which emand structural conditioning. 1 Experimental Setup To facilitate comparison with previous work, we our models on sections 2–21 of the section of the Penn treebank. We used the first 20 files (393 sentences) of section 22 as a development set This set is small enough that there is noticeable variance in individual results, but it allowed rapid search for good features via continually reparsing the devset in a partially manual hill-climb. All of section 23 was used as a test set for the final model. For each model, input trees were annotated or transformed in some way, as in Johnson (1998). Given a set of transformed trees, we viewed the local trees as grammar rewrite rules in the standard way, and used (unsmoothed) maximum-likelihood estimates rule To parse the grammar, we used a simple array-based Java implementation of generalized which, for our final best model, was able to exhaustively parse all sentences section 23 in memory, taking approxi- 3 sec for average length tagging probabilities were smoothed to accommodate words. The quantity estimated as follows: words were split into one of several categories based on capitalization, suffix, digit, and other character features. For each of these categories, we took the estimate of This distribution was used as a prior against which observed taggings, any, were taken, giving This was then inverted to The quality of this tagging model impacts numbers; for example the raw treebank grammar’s devset is 72.62 with it and 72.09 without it. parser is available for download as open source at:</abstract>

Having symbols for subject and object allows this variation to be captured and used to improve parse scoring. One way of capturing this kind of context is to use as prein Johnson (1998). For example, with (like subjects) will be marked while with (like objects) will be The second basic deficiency is that many rule types have been seen only once (and therefore have their probabilities overestimated), and many rules which occur in test sentences will never have been seen in training (and therefore have their probabilities underestimated – see Collins (1999) for analysis). Note that in parsing with the unsplit grammar, not having seen a rule doesn’t mean one gets a parse failure, but rather a possibly very weird parse (Charniak, 1996). One successful method of combating is to rules (Collins, 1999). In particular, we follow that work in markovizing out from the head child, despite the grammar being unlexicalized, because this seems the best way to capture the traditional linguistic insight that phrases are organized around a head (Radford, 1988). parent annotation (adding context) and markovization (removing it) can be seen as two instances of the same idea. In parsing, every node has a vertical history, including the node itself, parent, grandparent, and so on. A reasonable assumption is only the past ancestors matter to the expansion. Similarly, only the previous horizontal ancestors matter (we assume that the head child always matters). It is a historical accident that default notion of a treebank takes (only the current node matters vertically) and oc right hand sides do not decompose at all). On this view, it is unsurprising that increasing decreasing historically helped. an example, consider the case of If we start with the rule NP it will be broken into several stages, each a binary or unary rule, which conceptually represent a head-outward generation of the right hand size, as shown in figure 1. The bottom layer will be a unary the head declaring the goal: → The square brackets indicate that the head, while the angle brackets that symbol an intermediate symbol (equivalently, an active or incomplete state). The next layer up will generate the first rightward sibling of head child: → Next, the generated: → We would then branch off left if there were Finally, we have another to finish the Note that while it is convenient to think of this as a head-outward process, are just and so the actual scores attached to each rule will correspond to a downward generation order. Figure 2 presents a grid of horizontal and vertical markovizations of the grammar. The raw treegrammar corresponds to oc upper right corner), while the parent annotation in 1998) corresponds to and the second-order model in Collins (1999), is broadly smoothed version of In addito exact models, we tried variableour system, the last few right children carry over as preceding context for the left children, distinct from common practice. We found this wrapped horizon to be beneficial, and it also unifies the infinite order model with the unmarkovized raw rules.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.996940007476636">Figure 3: Size and devset performance of the cumulatively annotated models, starting with the markovized baseline. The two columns show the change in the baseline for each annotation introduced, both cumulatively and for each single annotation applied to the baseline in isolation. history models similar in intent to those described in Ron et al. (1994). For variable horizontal histories, we did not split intermediate states below 10 occurrences of a symbol. For example, if the symbol too rare, we would colit to For vertical histories, we used a cutoff which included both frequency and mutual information between the history and the expansions (this was not appropriate for the horizontal because unreliable at such low counts). Figure 2 shows parsing accuracies as well as the number of symbols in each markovization. These symbol counts include all the intermediate states which represent partially completed constituents. The general trend is that, in the absence of further annotation, more vertical annotation is better – even exhaustive grandparent annotation. This is not true for horizontal markovization, where the variableorder second-order model was superior. The best has an 79.74, already a substantial improvement over the baseline. In the remaining sections, we discuss other annotations which increasingly split the symbol space. Since we expressly do not smooth the grammar, not all splits are guaranteed to be beneficial, and not all sets of useful splits are guaranteed to co-exist well. particular, while markovization is good on its own, it has a large number of states and does not tolerate further splitting well. Therefore, base all further exploration on the ROOT S&amp;quot;ROOT 4: An error which can be resolved with the (incorrect baseline parse shown). grammar. Although it does not necessarily jump out of the grid at first glance, this point represents the best compromise between a compact grammar and useful markov histories. 3 External vs. Internal Annotation The two major previous annotation strategies, parent annotation and head lexicalization, can be seen as instances of external and internal annotation, respectively. Parent annotation lets us indicate an important feature of the external environment of a node which influences the internal expansion of that node. On the other hand, lexicalization is a (radical) method of marking a distinctive aspect of the otherwise hidden internal contents of a node which influence the external distribution. Both kinds of annotation can be useful. To identify split states, we suffixes of the form mark internal content and mark external features. To illustrate the difference, consider unary productions. In the raw grammar, there are many unaries, and once any major category is constructed over a span, most others become constructible as well using unary chains (see Klein and Manning (2001) for discussion). Such chains are rare in real treebank trees: unary rewrites only appear in very specific for example of verbs where an empty, controlled subject. Figure 4 shows an erroneous output of the parser, using the baseline markovized grammar. Intuitively, there are several reasons this parse should be ruled out, but is that the lower which is intended prifor of communication verbs, is not a unary rewrite position (such complements usually have subjects). It would therefore be natural to annotate the trees so as to confine unary productions to the contexts in which they are actually ap- We tried two annotations. First, .

One distributionally salient tag conflation in the Penn treebank is the identification of demonstraand regular determiners based on whether they were only captured this distinction.

The for example, showed that the determiners which occur alone are usefully distinguished from those which occur with other nomimaterial. This marks the with a single bit about their immediate external context: whether there are sisters. Given the success of parent annotation for nonterminals, it makes sense to parent antags, as well In fact, as figure 3 shows, exhaustively marking all preterminals with their parent category was the most effective single annotation we tried. Why should this be useful? Most tags have a canonical category. For example, occur under (only 234 of 70855 do not, mostly mistakes). However, when a tag that when we show such trees, we generally only show one annotation on top of the baseline at a time. Moreover, we do not explicitly show the binarization implicit by the horizontal markovization. two are not equivalent even given infinite data. 5: An error resolved with the (of the (a) the incorrect baseline parse and (b) the correct resolves this error. somewhat regularly occurs in a non-canonical position, its distribution is usually distinct. For example, most common adverbs directly under and Under they are and Under and and so on. substantially, to 80.62%. In addition to the adverb case, the Penn tag set conflates various grammatical distinctions that are commonly made in traditional and generative grammar, and from which a parser could hope to get useful information. For example, subordinating conas, complementizers prepositions in, all get the tag of these distinctions are captured by conjunctions occur under under but are not (both subordinating conjunctions and complementizers appear Also, there are exclusively nounprepositions predominantly verbones and so on. The annotation a linguistically motivated 6-way split the and brought the total to 81.19%.

Finally, we gave the percent sign (%) its own tag, in line with the dollar sign ($) already having its own. Together these three anbrought the 81.81%. 5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar? Around this point, we must address exactly what we by an To the extent that go about subcategorizing many of them might come to represent a single word. One might thus feel that the approach of this paper is to walk down a slippery slope, and that we are merely arguing degrees. However, we believe that there is a fundamental qualitative distinction, grounded in linguistic practice, between what we see as permitted an unlexicalized against what one finds hopes to exploit in lexicalized The division rests on the traditional distinction between words closed-class words) and open class or lexical words). It is standard practice in linguistics, dating back decades, to annotate phrasal nodes with important functiondistinctions, for example to have a a whereas content words are not part of grammatical structure, and one would not have sperules or constraints for an for example. We follow this approach in our model: various closed classes are subcategorized to better represent important distinctions, and important features commonly expressed by function words are annotated phrasal nodes (such as whether a finite, or a participle, or an infinitive clause). However, no use is made of lexical class words, to provide either or bilexical At any rate, we have kept ourselves honest by estimating our models exclusively by maximum likelihood estimation over our subcategorized grammar, without any form of interpolation or shrinkage to unsubcategorized categories (although we do rules, as explained above). This effecshould be noted that we started with four tags in the Penn tagset that rewrite as a single word: and some of the punctuation tags, which rewrite as barely more. To the extent that we subcategorize tags, there will be more such cases, but many of them already exist in other tag sets. For instance, many tag sets, such as the Brown and tagsets give a separate sets of tags to each form of verbal auxiliaries and most of which rewrite as only a single word (and any corresponding contractions). 6: An error resolved with the (a) incorrect baseline parse and (b) the correct tively means that the subcategories that we break off must themselves be very frequent in the language. In such a framework, if we try to annotate categories with any detailed lexical information, many sentences either entirely fail to parse, or have only extremely weird parses. The resulting battle against sparsity means that we can only afford to make a few distinctions which have major distributional impact. Even with the individual-lexeme annotations in this section, the grammar still has only 9255 states compared to the 7619 of the baseline model. 6 Annotations Already in the Treebank At this point, one might wonder as to the wisdom of stripping off all treebank functional tags, only to heuristically add other such markings back in to the grammar. By and large, the treebank out-of-the tags, such as have negative utility. Recall that the raw treebank gramwith no annotation or markovization, had an of 72.62% on our development set. With the functional annotation left in, this drops to 71.49%. The v markovization baseline of 77.77% dropped even further, all the way to 72.87%, when these annotations were included. Nonetheless, some distinctions present in the raw trees were valuable. For example, an an could be either a temporal a For the annotation we retained the on and, furthermore, propathe tag down to the tag of the head of the This is illustrated in figure 6, which also shows an of its utility, clarifying that last night is not a plausible compound and facilitating the othunusual high attachment of the smaller the cumulative 82.25%. Note that this technique of pushing the functional tags down to preterminals might be useful more generfor example, locative expand roughly the VPˆVP VPˆVP VB to NPˆVP appear NNˆTMP NPˆNP PPˆNP JJ PPˆNP NPˆNP appear NPˆVP VB NP-TMPˆVP to IN NNS last night JJ times three NNP NN on CD on times three last CNN night NPˆPP NNP CNN NPˆPP IN NNS CD (a) (b) ROOT Distance SˆROOT SˆROOT 7: An error resolved with the (a) incorrect baseline parse and (b) the correct way as all other (usually as but do tend to have different prepositions below A second kind of information in the original trees is the presence of empty elements. Following (1999), the annotation nodes which have an empty subject (i.e., raising and constructions). This brought 82.28%. 7 Head Annotation The notion that the head word of a constituent can affect its behavior is a useful one. However, often the head tag is as good (or better) an indicator of how constituent will We found several head annotations to be particularly effective. First, poshave a very different distribution than – in particular, are only used in the treebank when the leftmost child is possessive (as opposed to other imaginable uses like for York which is left flat). To address this, all possessive This brought total 83.06%. Second, the is very overloaded in the Penn treebank, most severely in that there is no distinction between finite and in- An example of the damage this conflation can do is given in figure 7, where one needs to capture the fact that present-tense verbs do not take bare infinitive To allow the finite/non-finite distinction, and other verb distinctions, all with their head tag, merging all finite forms to a sintag In particular, this also accomplished This was extremely bringing the cumulative 85.72%, 2.66% absolute improvement (more than its solo improvement over the baseline). is part of the explanation of why (Charniak, 2000) finds that early generation of head tags as in (Collins, 1999) is so beneficial. The rest of the benefit is presumably in the availability of the tags for smoothing purposes. Error analysis at this point suggested that many remaining errors were attachment level and conjunction scope. While these kinds of errors are undoubtedly profitable targets for lexical preference, most attachment mistakes were overly high attachments, indicating that the overall right-branching tendency of English was not being captured. Indeed, this tenis a difficult trend to capture in a because often the high and low attachments involve the very same rules. Even if not, attachment height is modeled by a it is somehow explicitly encoded into category labels. More complex parsing models have indirectly overcome this by modeling distance (rather than height). distance is difficult to encode in a – marking nodes with the size of their yields masmultiplies the state Therefore, we wish to find indirect indicators that distinguish high from low ones. In the case of two a with the question of whether the a second modifier of the leftmost should attach lower, inside the first the important distinction is usually that the lower site is a base Collins (1999) captures this by introducing the notion of a base in any dominates only preterminals is with a Further, if an not have non-base it is given one with a unary production. This was helpful, but substantially less than marking base the unary, whose presence actually erased a useful indicator – base are more frequent in subject position than object position, for example. In isolation, the Collins method actually hurt the base- (absolute cost to 0.37%), while skipping the unary insertion added an absolute 0.73% to the and brought the cumulative 86.04%. the case of attachment of a an eiabove or inside a relative clause, the high is distinct from the low one in that the already modified one contains a verb (and the low one may be base well). This is a partial explanation of the utility of verbal distance in Collins (1999). To inability to encode distance naturally in a naive somewhat ironic. In the heart of any the fundamental table entry or chart item is a label over a span, for exan position 0 to position 5. The concrete use of a grammar rule is to take two adjacent span-marked labels and them (for example and into Yet, only the labels are used to score the combination. “ DT “ NPˆS VBZ VPˆVP VPˆS ! . ” ” “ “ NPˆS DT NPˆVP ” . ! ” VPˆS-VBF VBZ (a) (b) NPˆVP buying This is This NN NN panic buying LP LR Exact CB 0 CB Magerman (1995) 84.9 84.6 1.26 56.6 Collins (1996) 86.3 85.8 1.14 59.9 this paper 86.9 85.7 86.3 30.9 1.10 60.3 Charniak (1997) 87.4 87.5 1.00 62.1 Collins (1999) 88.7 88.6 0.90 67.1 Figure 8: Results of the final model on the test set (section 23). this, all nodes which any verbal node with a This the cumulative 86.91%.

However, the dismal performance of basic unannotated unlexicalized grammars has generally rendered those advantages irrelevant. Here, we have shown that, surprisingly, the maximum-likelihood estimate of a compact unlexiparse on par with early lexicalized parsers. We do not want to argue that lexical selection is not a worthwhile component of a state-ofthe-art parser – certain attachments, at least, require it – though perhaps its necessity has been overstated. Rather, we have shown ways to improve parsing, some easier than lexicalization, and others of which are orthogonal to it, and could presumably be used to benefit lexicalized parsers as well.</abstract>

We see this investigation as only one part of the foundation for state-of-the-art parsing which employs both lexical and structural conditioning. </context>

In this paper, we show that the parsing performance that can be achieved by an unlexicalized PCFG is far higher than has previously been demonstrated, and is, indeed, much higher than community wisdom has thought possible. We describe several simple, linguistically motivated annotations which do much to close the gap between a vanilla PCFG and state-of-the-art lexicalized models. Specifically, we construct an unlexicalized PCFG which outperforms the lexicalized PCFGs of Magerman (1995) and Collins (1996) (though not more recent models, such as Charniak (1997) or Collins (1999)). One benefit of this result is a much-strengthened lower bound on the capacity of an unlexicalized PCFG. To the extent that no such strong baseline has been provided, the community has tended to greatly overestimate the beneficial effect of lexicalization in probabilistic parsing, rather than looking critically at where lexicalized probabilities are both needed to make the right decision and available in the training data. Secondly, this result affirms the value of linguistic analysis for feature discovery. The result has other uses and advantages: an unlexicalized PCFG is </context>

Note that while it is convenient to think of this as a head-outward process, these are just PCFG rewrites, and so the actual scores attached to each rule will correspond to a downward generation order. Figure 2 presents a grid of horizontal and vertical markovizations of the grammar. The raw treebank grammar corresponds to v = 1, h = oc (the upper right corner), while the parent annotation in (Johnson, 1998) corresponds to v = 2, h = oc, and the second-order model in Collins (1999), is broadly a smoothed version of v = 2, h = 2. In addition to exact nth-order models, we tried variable7In our system, the last few right children carry over as preceding context for the left children, distinct from common practice.

This brought F1 to 82.28%. 7 Head Annotation The notion that the head word of a constituent can affect its behavior is a useful one. However, often the head tag is as good (or better) an indicator of how a constituent will behave.12 We found several head annotations to be particularly effective.

More complex parsing models have indirectly overcome this by modeling distance (rather than height). Linear distance is difficult to encode in a PCFG – marking nodes with the size of their yields massively multiplies the state space.13 Therefore, we wish to find indirect indicators that distinguish high attachments from low ones. In the case of two PPs following a NP, with the question of whether the second PP is a second modifier of the leftmost NP or should attach lower, inside the first PP, the important distinction is usually that the lower site is a non-recursive base NP. Collins (1999) captures this notion by introducing the notion of a base NP, in which any NP which dominates only preterminals is marked with a -B. Further, if an NP-B does not have a non-base NP parent, it is given one with a unary production. This was helpful, but substantially less effective than marking base NPs without introducing the unary, whose presence actually erased a useful internal indicator – base NPs are more frequent in subject position than object position, for example. In isolation, the Collins method actually hurt the baseline (absolute cost to F1 of 0.37%), while skipping the unary insert</context>

It is not our goal to argue against the use of lexicalized probabilities in high-performance probabilistic parsing.

We used the first 20 files (393 sentences) of section 22 as a development set (devset). This set is small enough that there is noticeable variance in individual results, but it allowed rapid search for good features via continually reparsing the devset in a partially manual hill-climb. All of section 23 was used as a test set for the final model. For each model, input trees were annotated or transformed in some way, as in Johnson (1998). Given a set of transformed trees, we viewed the local trees as grammar rewrite rules in the standard way, and used (unsmoothed) maximum-likelihood estimates for rule probabilities.5 To parse the grammar, we used a simple array-based Java implementation of a generalized CKY parser, which, for our final best model, was able to exhaustively parse all sentences in section 23 in 1GB of memory, taking approximately 3 sec for average length sentences.6 5The tagging probabilities were smoothed to accommodate unknown words. The quantity P(tag|word) was estimated as follows: words were split into one </context>

This basic grammar is imperfect in two well-known ways. First, the category symbols are too coarse to adequately render the expansions independent of the contexts. For example, subject NP expansions are very different from object NP expansions: a subject NP is 8.7 times more likely than an object NP to expand as just a pronoun. Having separate symbols for subject and object NPs allows this variation to be captured and used to improve parse scoring. One way of capturing this kind of external context is to use parent annotation, as presented in Johnson (1998). For example, NPs with S parents (like subjects) will be marked NP&amp;quot;S, while NPs with VP parents (like objects) will be NP&amp;quot;VP. The second basic deficiency is that many rule types have been seen only once (and therefore have their probabilities overestimated), and many rules which occur in test sentences will never have been seen in training (and therefore have their probabilities underestimated – see Collins (1999) for analysis). Note that in parsing with the unsplit grammar, not having seen a rule doesn’t mean one gets a parse failure, but rather a possibly very weird parse (Charniak, 1996). </context>

We would then branch off left siblings if there were any.7 Finally, we have another unary to finish the VP. Note that while it is convenient to think of this as a head-outward process, these are just PCFG rewrites, and so the actual scores attached to each rule will correspond to a downward generation order. Figure 2 presents a grid of horizontal and vertical markovizations of the grammar. The raw treebank grammar corresponds to v = 1, h = oc (the upper right corner), while the parent annotation in (Johnson, 1998) corresponds to v = 2, h = oc, and the second-order model in Collins (1999), is broadly a smoothed version of v = 2, h = 2. In addition to exact nth-order models, we tried variable7In our system, the last few right children carry over as preceding context for the left children, distinct from common practice. We found this wrapped horizon to be beneficial, and it also unifies the infinite order model with the unmarkovized raw rules. Cumulative Indiv.

On the other hand, lexicalization is a (radical) method of marking a distinctive aspect of the otherwise hidden internal contents of a node which influence the external distribution. Both kinds of annotation can be useful. To identify split states, we add suffixes of the form -X to mark internal content features, and &amp;quot;X to mark external features. To illustrate the difference, consider unary productions. In the raw grammar, there are many unaries, and once any major category is constructed over a span, most others become constructible as well using unary chains (see Klein and Manning (2001) for discussion). Such chains are rare in real treebank trees: unary rewrites only appear in very specific contexts, for example S complements of verbs where the S has an empty, controlled subject. Figure 4 shows an erroneous output of the parser, using the baseline markovized grammar. Intuitively, there are several reasons this parse should be ruled out, but one is that the lower S slot, which is intended primarily for S complements of communication verbs, is not a unary rewrite position (such complements usually have subjects). It would therefore be natural to annotate the trees so as to con</context>

In this paper, we show that the parsing performance that can be achieved by an unlexicalized PCFG is far higher than has previously been demonstrated, and is, indeed, much higher than community wisdom has thought possible. We describe several simple, linguistically motivated annotations which do much to close the gap between a vanilla PCFG and state-of-the-art lexicalized models. Specifically, we construct an unlexicalized PCFG which outperforms the lexicalized PCFGs of Magerman (1995) and Collins (1996) (though not more recent models, such as Charniak (1997) or Collins (1999)). One benefit of this result is a much-strengthened lower bound on the capacity of an unlexicalized PCFG. To the extent that no such strong baseline has been provided, the community has tended to greatly overestimate the beneficial effect of lexicalization in probabilistic parsing, rather than looking critically at where lexicalized probabilities are both needed to make the right decision and available in the training data.

Note that in parsing with the unsplit grammar, not having seen a rule doesn’t mean one gets a parse failure, but rather a possibly very weird parse (Charniak, 1996). One successful method of combating sparsity is to markovize the rules (Collins, 1999). In particular, we follow that work in markovizing out from the head child, despite the grammar being unlexicalized, because this seems the best way to capture the traditional linguistic insight that phrases are organized around a head (Radford, 1988). Both parent annotation (adding context) and RHS markovization (removing it) can be seen as two instances of the same idea. In parsing, every node has a vertical history, including the node itself, parent, grandparent, and so on. A reasonable assumption is that only the past v vertical ancestors matter to the current expansion. Similarly, only the previous h horizontal ancestors matter (we assume that the head child always matters). It is a historical accident that the default notion of a treebank PCFG grammar takes v = 1 (only the current node matters vertically) and h = oc (rule right hand </context>
