We describe the WordsEye Linguistics
tool (WELT), a novel tool for the docu-
mentation and preservation of endangered
languages. WELT is based on Words-
Eye (Coyne and Sproat, 2001), a text-to-
scene tool that automatically generates 3D
scenes from written input. WELT has two
modes of operation. In the first mode, En-
glish input automatically generates a pic-
ture which can be used to elicit a de-
scription in the target language. In the
second mode, the linguist formally docu-
ments the grammar of an endangered lan-
guage, thereby creating a system that takes
input in the endangered language and gen-
erates a picture according to the grammar;
the picture can then be used to verify the
grammar with native speakers. We will
demonstrate WELT’s use on scenarios in-
volving Arrernte and Nahuatl.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958241379311">
Although languages have appeared and disap-
peared throughout history, today languages are
facing extinction at an unprecedented pace. Over
40% of the estimated 7,000 languages in the world
are at risk of disappearing. When languages die
out, we lose access to an invaluable resource for
studying the culture, history, and experience of
peoples around the world (Alliance for Linguistic
Diversity, 2013). Efforts to document languages
and develop tools in support of collecting data on
them become even more important with the in-
creasing rate of extinction. Bird (2009) empha-
sizes a particular need to make use of computa-
tional linguistics during fieldwork.
To address this issue, we are developing the
WordsEye Linguistics Tool, or WELT. In the first
mode of operation, we provide a field linguist with
tools for running custom elicitation sessions based
on a collection of 3D scenes. In the second, input
in an endangered language generates a picture rep-
resenting the input’s meaning according to a for-
mal grammar.
WELT provides important advantages for elic-
itation over the pre-fabricated sets of static pic-
tures commonly used by field linguists today. The
field worker is not limited to a fixed set of pictures
but can, instead, create and modify scenes in real
time, based on the informants’ answers. This al-
lows them to create additional follow-up scenes
and questions on the fly. In addition, since the
pictures are 3D scenes, the viewpoint can easily
be changed, allowing exploration of linguistic de-
scriptions based on different frames of reference.
This will be particularly useful in eliciting spatial
descriptions. Finally, since scenes and objects can
easily be added in the field, the linguist can cus-
tomize the images used for elicitation to be maxi-
mally relevant to the current informants.
WELT also provides a means to document the
semantics of a language in a formal way. Lin-
guists can customize their studies to be as deep or
shallow as they wish; however, we believe that a
major advantage of documenting a language with
WELT is that it enables such studies to be much
more precise. The fully functioning text-to-scene
system created as a result of this documentation
will let linguists easily test the theories they de-
velop with native speakers, making changes to
grammars and semantics in real time. The result-
ing text-to-scene system can be an important tool
for language preservation, spreading interest in the
language among younger generations of the com-
munity and recruiting new speakers.
We will demonstrate the features of WELT
for use in fieldwork, including designing elic-
itation sessions, building scenes, recording au-
dio, and adding descriptions and glosses to a
scene. We will use examples from sessions we

One of the most widely-used computer toolkits for
field linguistics is SIL Fieldworks. FieldWorks is
a collection of software tools; the most relevant
for our research is FLEx, Fieldworks Language
Explorer. FLEx includes tools for eliciting and
recording lexical information, dictionary develop-
ment, interlinearization of texts, analysis of dis-
course features, and morphological analysis. An
important part of FLEx is its “linguist-friendly”
morphological parser (Black and Simons, 2006),
which uses an underlying model of morphology
familiar to linguists, is fully integrated into lexicon
development and interlinear text analysis, and pro-
duces a human-readable grammar sketch as well
as a machine-interpretable parser.
Several computational tools aim to simplify the
formal documentation of syntax by eliminating
the need to master particular grammar formalisms.
First is the PAWS starter kit (Black and Black,
2012), a system that prompts linguists with a series
of guided questions about the target language and
uses their answers to produce a PC-PATR gram-
mar (McConnel, 1995). The LinGO Grammar
Matrix (Bender et al., 2002) is a similar tool de-
veloped for HPSG that uses a type hierarchy to
represent cross-linguistic generalizations.
The most commonly used resource for for-
mally documenting semantics across languages
is FrameNet (Filmore et al., 2003). FrameNets
have been developed for many languages, includ-
ing Spanish, Japanese, and Portuguese. Most
start with English FrameNet and adapt it for the
new language; a large portion of the frames end
up being substantially the same across languages
(Baker, 2008). ParSem (Butt et al., 2002) is a
collaboration to develop parallel semantic repre-
sentations across languages, by developing seman-
tic structures based on LFG. Neither of these re-
sources, however, are targeted at helping non-
computational linguists formally document a lan-
guage, as compared to the morphological parser in
FLEx or the syntactic documentation in PAWS.

3 WordsEye Text-to-Scene System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946142857143">
WordsEye (Coyne and Sproat, 2001) is a system
for automatically converting natural language text
into 3D scenes representing the meaning of that
text. WordsEye supports language-based control
of spatial relations, textures and colors, collec-
tions, facial expressions, and poses; it handles
simple anaphora and coreference resolution, al-
lowing for a variety of ways of referring to ob-
jects. The system assembles scenes from a library
of 2,500 3D objects and 10,000 images tied to an
English lexicon of about 15,000 nouns.
The system includes a user interface where the
user can type simple sentences that are processed
to produce a 3D scene. The user can then modify
the text to refine the scene. In addition, individual
objects and their parts can be selected and high-
lighted with a bounding box to focus attention.
Several thousand real-world people have used
WordsEye online (http://www.wordseye.com). It
has also been used as a tool in education, to en-
hance literacy (Coyne et al., 2011b). In this paper,
we describe how we are using WordsEye to create
a comprehensive tool for field linguistics.
Vignette Semantics and VigNet To interpret in-
put text, WordsEye uses a lexical resource called
VigNet (Coyne et al., 2011a). VigNet is inspired
by and based on FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998),
a resource for lexical semantics. In FrameNet,
lexical items are grouped together in frames ac-
cording to their shared semantic structure. Every
frame contains a number of frame elements (se-
mantic roles) which are participants in this struc-
ture. The English FrameNet defines the mapping
between syntax and semantics for a lexical item by
providing lists of valence patterns that map syntac-
tic functions to frame elements.
VigNet extends FrameNet in two ways in or-
der to capture “graphical semantics’,’ the knowl-
edge needed to generate graphical scenes from
language. First, graphical semantics are added
to the frames by adding primitive graphical (typ-
ically, spatial) relations between the frame ele-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999436166666667">
ment fillers. Second, VigNet distinguishes be-
tween meanings of words that are distinguished
graphically. For example, the specific objects
and spatial relations in the graphical semantics for
cook depend on the object being cooked and on
the culture in which it is being cooked (cooking
turkey in Baltimore vs. cooking an egg in Alice
Springs), even though at an abstract level cook an
egg in Alice Springs and cook a turkey in Bal-
timore are perfectly compositional semantically.
Frames augmented with graphical semantics are
called vignettes.

In this section, we describe the two modes of
WELT, focusing on the aspects of our system that
will appear in our demonstration.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.883657">
4.1 Tools for Linguistic Fieldwork
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999472913043478">
WELT includes tools that allow linguists to elicit
language with WordsEye. Each elicitation session
is organized around a set of WordsEye scenes. We
will demonstrate how a linguist would use WELT
in fieldwork, including (1) creating an elicitation
session, either starting from scratch, or by import-
ing scenes from a previous session; (2) building
scenes in WordsEye, saving them to a WELT ses-
sion, and modifying scenes previously added to
the session, either overwriting the original scene or
saving the changes as a new scene; (3) adding tex-
tual descriptions, glosses, and notes to a scene; and
(4) recording audio, which is automatically synced
to open scenes, and playingit back tto review any
given scene. A screen shot of the scene annotation
window is included in Figure 1.
To test the fieldwork capabilities of WELT,
we created a set of scenes based on the Max
Planck topological relations picture series (Bower-
man and Pederson, 1992). We used these scenes to
elicit descriptions from a native Nahuatl speaker;
some examples of scenes and descriptions are in-
cluded in Figure 2.

4.2 Formal Documentation of a Language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929857142857">
WELT also provides the means to formally doc-
ument the semantics of a language and create a
text-to-scene system for that language. The formal
documentation allows precise description of the
lexical semantics of a language. We will demon-
strate both the user interface for documenting se-
mantics, as well as a text-to-scene system for Ar-

rernte created with WELT.
When a sentence is processed by WordsEye, it
goes through three main stages: (1) morphological
analysis and syntactic parsing, (2) semantic anal-
ysis, and (3) graphical realization. We will walk
through these modules in the context of WELT,
discussing (a) the formal documentation required
for that component, (b) the processing of an ex-
ample sentence through that component, and (c)
the parts of that component that will feature in our
demonstration. We will use the Arrernte sentence
shown in (1) as a running example.
(1) artwe le goal arrerneme
man ERG goal put.nonpast
The man kicks a goal.
Morphology and Syntax WELT first parses a
sentence into its morphology and syntax. Since
the focus of WELT is documentation of semantics,
the exact mechanisms for parsing the morphology
and syntax may vary. To document Arrernte, we
are using XFST (Karttunen et al., 1997) to model
the morphology and XLE (Crouch et al., 2006) to
model the syntax in the LFG formalism (Kaplan
and Bresnan, 1982). These are mature systems
that we believe are sufficient for the formal doc-
umentation of morphology and syntax. In future,
we will provide interfaces to the third-party tools
so that common information, like the lexicon, can

be shared.
Running each word of the sentence through
the morphological analyzer in XFST transforms
the verb arrerneme into ‘arrerne+NONPAST.’ The
other tokens in the sentence remain unchanged.
Parsing the sentence with XLE gives the c-
structure shown in Figure 3(a) and the f-structure
shown in Figure 3(b). The f-structure will be
passed on to the semantics module.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944824561404">
We have added one additional feature to the
morphology and syntax module of WELT’s text-
to-scene system: an interface for selecting an f-
structure from multiple options produced by XLE,
in case the grammar is ambiguous. This way, a
linguist can use the WELT text-to-scene system
to verify their semantic documentation even if the
syntactic documentation is fairly rough. We will
demonstrate this feature when demonstrating the
Arrernte text-to-scene system.
Semantics The WELT semantics is represented
using VigNet, which has been developed for
WordsEye based on English. We will assume that
large parts of VigNet are language-independent
(for instance, the set of low-level graphical rela-
tions used to express the graphical semantics is
based on physics and human anatomy and does not
depend on language). Therefore, it should not be
necessary to create a completely new VigNet for
every language that will be used in WELT. In fu-
ture, we will develop tools for modifying VigNet
to handle linguistic and cultural differences as they
occur.
In order to use VigNet with other languages,
we need to map between the formal syntax of the
language being studied and the (English) lexical
semantics required currently by VigNet. One in-
stance showing why this is necessary occurs in our
example Arrrente sentence. When discussing foot-
ball in English, one would say that someone kicks
a goal or makes a goal. In Arrente, one would say
goal arrerneme, which translates literally to “put
a goal.” Although the semantics of both sentences
are the same, the entry for “put” in the English
VigNet does not include this meaning, but the Ar-
rernte text-to-scene system needs to account for it.
To address such instances, we have created an
interface for a linguist to specify a set of rules that
map from syntax to semantics. The rules take syn-
tactic f-structures as input and output a high-level
semantic representation compatible with VigNet.
The left-hand side of a rule consists of a set of con-
ditions on the f-structure elements and the right-
hand side consists of the semantic structure that
should be returned. Figure 4(a) is an example of
a rule mapping Arrernte syntax to semantics, cre-
ated in WELT.
In addition to these rules, the linguist creates a
simple table mapping lexical items into VigNet se-
mantic concepts, so that nouns can be converted to
graphical objects. We have created a mapping for
the lexical items in the Arrernte grammar; a partial
mapping is shown in Table 1.
We now describe the semantic processing of our
example Arrernte sentence, assuming a set of rules
consisting solely of the one in Figure 4(a) and the
noun mapping in Table 1. The f-structure in Fig-

ure 3(b) has main predicate arrerne with two ar-
guments; the object is goal. Therefore, it matches
the left-hand-side of our rule. The output of
the rule specifies predicate CAUSE MOTION.KICK
with three arguments. The latter two are straight-
forward; the Theme is the VigNet object FOOTY-
BALL.N, and the Goal is FOOTYGOAL.N. To deter-
mine the Agent, we need to find the VigNet con-
cept corresponding to var-1, which occupies the
subject position in the f-structure. The subject in
our f-structure is artwe, and according to Table 1,
it maps to the VigNet concept PERSON.N. The re-
sulting semantic representation is augmented with
its graphical semantics, taken from the vignette
for CAUSE MOTION.KICK (vignette definition not
shown for lack of space). The final representation
is shown in Figure 5, with lexical semantics at the
top and graphical semantics below. The Words-
Eye system then builds the scene from these con-
straints and renders it in 3D.

WELT provides an interface for creating rules
by defining the tree structures for the left-hand-
side and right-hand-side of the rule. Every node on
the left-hand-side can optionally contain boolean
logic, if for example we want to allow the sub-
ject to be [(artwe ‘man’ OR arhele ‘woman’) AND
NOT ampe ‘child’]; so rules can be as simple or
complex as desired. Rules need not specify lexical
items directly; it is also possible to refer to more
general semantic categories. For example, a rule
could select for all verbs of motion, or specify a
particular constraint on the subject or object. In
figure 4(a), for instance, we may want to only al-
low animate subjects.
Semantic categories are chosen through a
browser that allows the user to search through all
the semantic categories defined in VigNet. For ex-
ample, if we want to find the semantic category
to use as a constraint on our example subject, we
might start by searching for human. This takes us
to a portion of a tree of semantic concepts cen-
tered around HUMAN.N. The semantic categories
are displayed one level at a time, so we initially
see only the concepts directly above and directly
below the word we searched for. From there, it’s
easy to select the concepts we are interested in,
and go up or down the tree until we find the one we
want. Below HUMAN.N are HUMAN-FEMALE.N
and HUMAN-MALE.N, but we are more interested
in the more general categories above the node. A
screen shot showing the result of this search is
shown in Figure 4(b). Above HUMAN.N is HU-
MANOID.N; above that, ANIMATE-BEING.N. Do-
ing a quick check of further parents and chil-
dren, we can see that for the subject of ‘put goal,’
we would probably want to choose ANIMATE-
BEING.N over LIVING-THING.N.
The table mapping lexical items to VigNet con-
cepts is built in a similar way; the lexicon is au-
tomatically extracted from the LFG grammar, and
the user can search and browse semantic concepts
to find the appropriate node for each lexical item.
We will demonstrate the WELT user inter-

face which supports the creation of syntax-to-

nouns in the lexicon and VigNet concepts, and ver-
ifies the rules using the WELT text-to-scene sys-
tem. We will show examples from our documenta-
tion of Arrernte and demonstrate entering text into
the Arrernte text-to-scene system to generate pic-

5 Summary and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971148148148">
We have described a novel tool for linguists work-
ing with endangered languages. It provides a new
way to elicit data from informants, an interface
for formally documenting the lexical semantics of
a language, and allows the creation of a text-to-
scene system for any language.
This project is in its early stages, so we are plan-
ning many additional features and improvements.
For both modes of WELT, we want to generate pic-
tures appropriate for the target culture. To han-
dle this, we will add the ability to include cus-
tom objects and modify VigNet with new vignettes
or new graphical semantics for existing vignettes.
We also plan to build tools to import and export
the work done in WELT in order to facilitate col-
laboration among linguists working on similar lan-
guages or cultures. Sharing sets of scenes will al-
low linguists to reuse work and avoid duplicated
effort. Importing different versions of VigNet will
make it easier to start out with WELT on a new
language if it is similar to one that has already
been studied. We might expect, for instance, that
other Australian aboriginal languages will require
the same kinds of cultural modifications to VigNet
that we make for Arrernte, or that two languages
in the same family might also have similar syntax
to semantics rules.

<abstract confidence="0.989482571428571">We describe the WordsEye Linguistics tool (WELT), a novel tool for the documentation and preservation of endangered languages. WELT is based on Words- Eye (Coyne and Sproat, 2001), a text-toscene tool that automatically generates 3D scenes from written input. WELT has two modes of operation. In the first mode, English input automatically generates a picture which can be used to elicit a description in the target language. In the second mode, the linguist formally documents the grammar of an endangered language, thereby creating a system that takes input in the endangered language and generates a picture according to the grammar; the picture can then be used to verify the grammar with native speakers. We will demonstrate WELT’s use on scenarios involving Arrernte and Nahuatl.</abstract>

In this paper, we describe how we are using WordsEye to create a comprehensive tool for field linguistics. Vignette Semantics and VigNet To interpret input text, WordsEye uses a lexical resource called VigNet (Coyne et al., 2011a). VigNet is inspired by and based on FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), a resource for lexical semantics. In FrameNet, lexical items are grouped together in frames according to their shared semantic structure. Every frame contains a number of frame elements (semantic roles) which are participants in this structure. The English FrameNet defines the mapping between syntax and semantics for a lexical item by providing lists of valence patterns that map syntactic functions to frame elements. VigNet extends FrameNet in two ways in order to capture “graphical semantics’,’ the knowledge needed to generate graphical scenes from language. First, graphical semantics are a</context>

Over 40% of the estimated 7,000 languages in the world are at risk of disappearing. When languages die out, we lose access to an invaluable resource for studying the culture, history, and experience of peoples around the world (Alliance for Linguistic Diversity, 2013). Efforts to document languages and develop tools in support of collecting data on them become even more important with the increasing rate of extinction. Bird (2009) emphasizes a particular need to make use of computational linguistics during fieldwork. To address this issue, we are developing the WordsEye Linguistics Tool, or WELT. In the first mode of operation, we provide a field linguist with tools for running custom elicitation sessions based on a collection of 3D scenes. In the second, input in an endangered language generates a picture representing the input’s meaning according to a formal grammar. WELT provides important advantages for elicitation over the pre-fabricated sets of static pictures commonly used by field linguists today. The field wor</context>

FLEx includes tools for eliciting and recording lexical information, dictionary development, interlinearization of texts, analysis of discourse features, and morphological analysis.

Several computational tools aim to simplify the formal documentation of syntax by eliminating the need to master particular grammar formalisms. First is the PAWS starter kit (Black and Black, 2012), a system that prompts linguists with a series of guided questions about the target language and uses their answers to produce a PC-PATR grammar (McConnel, 1995). The LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002) is a similar tool developed for HPSG that uses a type hierarchy to represent cross-linguistic generalizations. The most commonly used resource for formally documenting semantics across languages is FrameNet (Filmore et al., 2003). FrameNets have been developed for many languages, including Spanish, Japanese, and Portuguese. Most start with English FrameNet and adapt it for the new language; a large portion of the frames end up being substantially the same across languages (Baker, 2008).
