The authors turn an Instance-Based Learning model (IBL) loose on some Dutch stress
data. They come to a number of conclusions regarding the models that could underlie
human stress acquisition, to wit, &amp;quot;... tree building operations proposed in learning the-
ories for metrical phonology are not necessary for learning stress assignment&amp;quot; (p. 449)
One assumes that this conclusion carries over to grid building as well. A second
conclusion is that &amp;quot;... phonemic representations yield significantly better results [in
learning Dutch irregular stress/JK] than the encoding in terms of syllable weights&amp;quot;
(p. 449) In my opinion, the authors have failed to justify either conclusion.
Their work involves modeling the acquisition of Dutch stress. Specifically, the
learning task is to assign Dutch input words to one of three categories: PEN, FIN, or
ANT. Since systems very different from the Dutch one exist, the requirements of learn-
ing systems based exclusively on it can be carried over to the more general problem
of human stress acquisition. Crucially, the authors do not consider the assignment of
secondary stress or any of the other types of stress systems attested in the literature.
The authors consider three methods of encoding input forms: (1) syllable weights,
(2) the &amp;quot;phonemes&amp;quot; of the rhyme projection, (3) a plain &amp;quot;phonemic&amp;quot; transcription of
the word. The authors test these three methods with respect to Dutch stress placement.
Research on human stress systems has failed to turn up examples where the segmental
content of a form is relevant to general patterns of stress assignment. Statements of the
form, &amp;quot;assign stress to the final nucleus unless it contains &amp;quot;i&amp;quot; in which case assign stress
to the penultimate nucleus&amp;quot; are unattested. Accordingly, the conclusion of Daelemans
et al. that &amp;quot;... the phonemic representations yield significantly better results than the
encoding in terms of syllable weights&amp;quot; (p. 449) is surprising. Daelemans et al. note
that for regular stress assignment (i.e. stress assignment based on syllable weight) the
first encoding is the most successful. Encodings 2 and 3 only come into their own
with respect to lexical exceptions. The authors fail to distinguish two very different
operations: (1) the assignment of stress based on phonological structure and (2) the
identification of lexical exceptions. While segmental content is irrelevant for the first
task, it is essential for the second. It is clear that segmental material is required for
the assignment of arbitrary marks a—ex], LF, etc.) because we must know to which
lexical items these diacritical marks are assigned. What emerges from the discussion
is that the irrelevance of segmental material to stress assignment is supported by the
current study. Indeed, there are many examples of stress systems where 100% of the
lexical items belong to the &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; (regular) class. I know of no stress systems that are
entirely based on patterns requiring &amp;quot;phonemic&amp;quot; information.
In conclusion, the restricted nature of the model deprives the theoretical claims of
much of their relevance. Failure to distinguish stress assignment based on constituent
structure vs. stress assignment as a property of certain lexical items attenuates the
authors&apos; claims about the relevance of the encoding methods. I believe we can remain
secure in the belief that segmental material is irrelevant to stress assignment.
