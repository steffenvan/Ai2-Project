In this paper we describe CarmelTC , a novel automatic
essay grading approach using a hybrid text classifica-
tion technique for analyzing essay answers to qualitative
physics questions inside the Why2 tutorial dialogue sys-
tem (VanLehn et al., 2002). In contrast to many previ-
ous approaches to automated essay grading (Burstein et
al., 1998; Foltz et al., 1998; Larkey, 1998), our goal is
not to assign a letter grade to student essays. Instead, our
purpose is to tally which set of “correct answer aspects”
are present in student essays. Previously, tutorial dia-
logue systems such as AUTO-TUTOR (Wiemer-Hastings
et al., 1998) and Research Methods Tutor (Malatesta et al.,
2002) have used LSA (Landauer et al., 1998) to perform
the same type of content analysis for student essays that
we do in Why2. While Bag of Words approaches such as
LSA have performed successfully on the content analy-
sis task in domains such as Computer Literacy (Wiemer-
Hastings et al., 1998), they have been demonstrated to
perform poorly in causal domains such as research meth-
ods (Malatesta et al., 2002) because they base their pre-
dictions only on the words included in a text and not on
the functional relationships between them. Thus, we pro-
pose CarmelTC as an alternative. CarmelTC is a rule
learning text classification approach that bases its predic-
tions both on features extracted from CARMEL’s deep

ence Division under grant number N00014-0-1-0600 and by

syntactic functional analyses of texts (Ros´e, 2000) and a
“bag of words” classification of that text obtained from
Rainbow Naive Bayes (McCallum and Nigam, 1998).
We evaluate CarmelTC in the physics domain, which is
a highly causal domain like research methods. In our
evaluation we demonstrate that CarmelTC outperforms
both Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al.,
1998) and Rainbow Naive Bayes (McCallum and Nigam,
1998), as well as a purely symbolic approach similar to
(Furnkranz et al., 1998). Thus, our evaluation demon-
strates the advantage of combining predictions from sym-
bolic and “bag of words” approaches for content analysis
aspects of automatic essay grading.

2 Student Essay Analysis

We cast the Student Essay Analysis problem as a text clas-
sification problem where we classify each sentence in the
student’s essay as an expression one of a set of “correct
answer aspects”, or “nothing” in the case where no “cor-
rect answer aspect” was expressed. Essays are first seg-
mented into individual sentence units. Next, each seg-
ment is classified as corresponding to one of the set of key
points or “nothing” if it does not include any key point.
We then take an inventory of the classifications other than
“nothing” that were assigned to at least one segment. We
performed our evaluation over essays collected from stu-
dents interacting with our tutoring system in response to
the question “Suppose you are running in a straight line at
constant speed. You throw a pumpkin straight up. Where
will it land? Explain.”, which we refer to as the Pumpkin
Problem. Thus, there are a total of six alternative classifi-
cations for each segment:
Class 1 After the release the only force acting on the
pumpkin is the downward force of gravity.
Class 2 The pumpkin continues to have a constant hori-
zontal velocity after it is released.
Class 3 The horizontal velocity of the pumpkin contin-
ues to be equal to the horizontal velocity of the man.
Class 4 The pumpkin and runner cover the same distance
over the same time.
Class 5 The pumpkin will land on the runner.
Class 6 Sentence does not adequately express any of the
above specified key points.
Often what distinguishes sentences from one class and
another is subtle. For example, “The pumpkin’s horizon-
tal velocity, which is equal to that of the man when he re-
leased it, will remain constant.” belongs to Class 2. How-
ever, it could easily be mistaken for Class 3 based on the
set of words included, although it does not express that
idea since it does not address the relationship between the
pumpkin’s and man’s velocity after the release. Similarly,
“So long as no other horizontal force acts upon the pump-
kin while it is in the air, this velocity will stay the same.”,
belongs to Class 2 although looks similar on the surface to
either Class 1 or 3. Nevertheless, it does not express the
required propositional content for either of those classes.
The most frequent problem is that sentences that express
most but not all of the content associated with a required
point should be classified as “nothing” although they have
a lot of words in common with sentences from the class
that they are most similar to. Similarly, sentences like “It
will land on the ground where the runner threw it up.”
contain all of the words required to correctly express the
idea corresponding to Class 5, although it does not ex-
press that idea, and in fact expresses a wrong idea. These
very subtle distinctions pose problems for “bag of words”
approaches since they base their decisions only on which
words are present regardless of their order or the func-
tional relationships between them.
The hybrid CarmelTC approach induces decision trees
using features from a deep syntactic functional analysis
of an input text as well as a prediction from the Rainbow
Naive Bayes text classifier (McCallum and Nigam, 1998).
Additionally, it uses features that indicate the presence or
absence of words found in the training examples. From
these features CarmelTC builds a vector representation
for each sentence. It then uses the ID3 decision tree learn-
ing algorithm (Quinlin,1993) to induce rules for identify-
ing sentence classes based on these feature vectors.
From CARMEL’s deep syntactic analysis of a sen-
tence, we extract individual features that encode func-
tional relationships between syntactic heads (e.g., (subj-
throw man)), tense information (e.g., (tense-throw past)),
and information about passivization and negation (e.g.,
(negation-throw +) or (passive-throw -)). Syntactic fea-
ture structures produced by the grammar factor out those
aspects of syntax that modify the surface realization of
a sentence but do not change its deep functional analy-
sis, including syntactic transformations such as passiviza-
tion and extraction. These deep functional relationships
give CarmelTC the information lacking on Bag of Words
approaches that is needed for effective content analysis
in highly causal domains, such as research methods or
physics.

3 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929177777778">
We conducted an evaluation to compare the effective-
ness of CarmelTC at analyzing student essays in compar-
ison to LSA, Rainbow, and a purely symbolic approach
similar to (Furnkranz et al., 1998), which we refer to
here as CarmelTCsymb. CarmelTCsymb is identical to
CarmelTC except that it does not include in its feature set
the prediction from Rainbow. We conducted our evalua-
tion over a corpus of 126 previouslyunseen student essays
in response to the Pumpkin Problem described above,
with a total of 500 text segments, and just under 6000
words altogether. Each text segment was hand tagged
by at least two coders, and conflicts were resolved at a
consensus meeting. Pairwise Kappas between our three
coders computed over initial codings of our data was al-
ways above .75.
The LSA space used for this evaluation was trained
over three first year physics text books. The Rainbow
models used to generate the Rainbow predictions that are
part of the feature set provided to CarmelTC were trained
over a development corpus of 248 hand tagged example
sentences extracted from a corpus of human-human tu-
toring dialogues, just like those included in the 126 es-
says mentioned above. However, when we evaluated the
performance of Rainbow for comparison with CarmelTC,
LSA, and the symbolic approach, we ran a 50 fold cross
validation evaluation using the complete set of examples
in both sets (i.e., the 248 sentences used to train the Rain-
bow models used to by CarmelTC as well as the 126 es-
says) so that Rainbow would have access to the exact
same training data as CarmelTC, to make it a fair com-
parison between alternative machine learning approaches.
On each iteration, we randomly selected a subset of essays
such that the number of text segments included in the test
set were greater than 10 but less than 15 and then train-
ing Rainbow using the remaining text segments. Thus,
CarmelTC uses the same set of training data, but unlike
the other approaches, it uses its training data in two sepa-
rate parts, namely one to train the Rainbow models it uses
to produce the Rainbow prediction that is part of the vec-
tor representation it builds for each text and one to train
the decision trees. This is because for CarmelTC, the data
for training Rainbow must be separate from that used to
train the decision trees so the decision trees are trained
from a realistic distribution of assigned Rainbow classes
based on its performance on unseen data rather than on

Rainbow’s training data. Thus, for CarmelTC, we also
performed a 50 fold cross validation, but this time only
over the set of 126 example essays not used to train the
Rainbow models used by CarmelTC.
Note that LSA works by using its trained LSA space
to construct a vector representation for any text based on
the set of words included therein. It can thus be used
for text classification by comparing the vector obtained
for a set of exemplar texts for each class with that ob-
tained from the text to be classified. We tested LSA using
as exemplars the same set of examples used as Rainbow
training data, but it always performed better when using a
small set of hand picked exemplars. Thus, we present re-
sults here using only those hand picked exemplars. For
every approach except LSA, we first segmented the es-
says at sentence boundaries and classified each sentence
separately. However, for LSA, rather than classify each
segment separately, we compared the LSA vector for the
entire essay to the exemplars for each class (other than
“nothing”), since LSA’s performance is better with longer
texts. We verified that LSA also performed better specif-
ically on our task under these circumstances. Thus, we
compared each essay to each exemplar, and we counted
LSA as identifying the corresponding “correct answer as-
pect” if the cosine value obtained by comparing the two
vectors was above a threshold. We used a threshold value
of .53, which we determined experimentally to achieve
the optimal f-score result, using a beta value of 1 in order
to treat precision and recall as equally important.
Figure 1 demonstrates that CarmelTC out performs the
other approaches, achieving the highest f-score, which
combines the precision and recall scores into a single
measure. Thus, it performs better at this task than two
commonly used purely “bag of words” approaches as well
as to an otherwise equivalent purely symbolic approach.

Thus, we propose CarmelTC as an alternative. CarmelTC is a rule learning text classification approach that bases its predictions both on features extracted from CARMEL’s deep This research was supported by the ONR, Cognitive Science Division under grant number N00014-0-1-0600 and by NSF grant number 9720359 to CIRCLE. syntactic functional analyses of texts (Ros´e, 2000) and a “bag of words” classification of that text obtained from Rainbow Naive Bayes (McCallum and Nigam, 1998). We evaluate CarmelTC in the physics domain, which is a highly causal domain like research methods. In our evaluation we demonstrate that CarmelTC outperforms both Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998) and Rainbow Naive Bayes (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), as well as a purely symbolic approach similar to (Furnkranz et al., 1998). Thus, our evaluation demonstrates the advantage of combining predictions from symbolic and “bag of words” approaches for content analysis aspects of automatic essay grading. 2 Student Essay Analysis We cast the Student Essay Analysis problem as a text c</context>

These very subtle distinctions pose problems for “bag of words” approaches since they base their decisions only on which words are present regardless of their order or the functional relationships between them. The hybrid CarmelTC approach induces decision trees using features from a deep syntactic functional analysis of an input text as well as a prediction from the Rainbow Naive Bayes text classifier (McCallum and Nigam, 1998). Additionally, it uses features that indicate the presence or absence of words found in the training examples. From these features CarmelTC builds a vector representation for each sentence. It then uses the ID3 decision tree learning algorithm (Quinlin,1993) to induce rules for identifying sentence classes based on these feature vectors. From CARMEL’s deep syntactic analysis of a sentence, we extract individual features that encode functional relationships between syntactic heads (e.g., (subjthrow man)), tense information (e.g., (tense-throw past)), and information about passivization and neg</context>

In contrast to many previous approaches to automated essay grading (Burstein et al., 1998; Foltz et al., 1998; Larkey, 1998), our goal is not to assign a letter grade to student essays. Instead, our purpose is to tally which set of “correct answer aspects” are present in student essays. Previously, tutorial dialogue systems such as AUTO-TUTOR (Wiemer-Hastings et al., 1998) and Research Methods Tutor (Malatesta et al., 2002) have used LSA (Landauer et al., 1998) to perform the same type of content analysis for student essays that we do in Why2. While Bag of Words approaches such as LSA have performed successfully on the content analysis task in domains such as Computer Literacy (WiemerHastings et al., 1998), they have been demonstrated to perform poorly in causal domains such as research methods (Malatesta et al., 2002) because they base their predictions only on the words included in a text and not on the functional relationships between them. Thus, we propose </context>
