Spoken dialogue systems have received in-
creased interest because they are potentially
much more natural and powerful methods
of communicating with machines than are
current graphics-based interfaces. Wired for
Speech presents basic research in the psycho-
logical and sociological aspects of voice syn-
thesis and recognition. Its major lesson is that
people attribute human characteristics to spo-
ken dialogue systems for reasons related to
human evolution. But although it contains in-
teresting basic research, the book is mainly
aimed at giving technological or marketing
advice to those seeking to use voice interfaces
when creating commercial applications.
The book is oriented around a series of
simple experiments designed to show just
how pervasive psychological and social influ-
ences can be on the opinions and behaviors of
people confronted with voice interfaces. Each
chapter describes a basic research hypothesis,
introduces an experiment to test it, and dis-
cusses its implications for designing voice in-
terfaces: gender, personality, accent, ethnicity,
emotion, number of distinct voices, use of “I”
by the system, voices in concert with faces,
mixed synthetic and recorded voices, context,
and the effects of errors in human–computer
cooperation.
Although Wired for Speech is very accessi-
ble, especially to the non-scientist, it is writ-
ten with an unusual bibliography style for
an academic book: All references and details
are given in a notes section at the end of the
book, making up one third of the content.
This narrative exposition style will probably
not satisfy either type of reader: Scientists will
be frustrated at the imprecision in argumen-
tation, lack of detail in the book itself, and
continually having to refer to the notes. The
lack of detail also prevents the book from
serving as a reference work. Meanwhile those
needing advice when implementing voice
interfaces will be puzzled at references to
Chomsky, Grice, and Zemlin. Thus the book
seems to suffer from not knowing its audi-
ence well, which is odd as this is precisely the
lesson that the book tries to impart.
Another complaint from the scientific point
of view is the obsession this particular book
has with casting every experimental result
as advice for the business and marketing
side of voice interfaces, typically concentrat-
ing on Web-based e-marketing examples such
as buying books on line. Most of the experi-
ments have sample sizes of between 40 and
50, but the authors seem ready to invite multi-
billion-dollar businesses to immediately base
their deployed systems on these results.
Finally, and fundamentally, this book repre-
sents research on psychology and sociology,
and the impact of these approaches on the
interactions between people and machines.
It contains very little linguistic content (for
instance, text-to-speech system (TTSs) are de-
scribed only in terms of their ability to mod-
ify pitch, pitch range, volume, etc.) and some
of the linguistic detail is wrong, such as
the discussion on dialects in the chapter on
accent, race, and ethnicity, as well as lexical
alignment.
Wired for Speech may hold a strong place in
the literature on practical advice for human–
computer interaction, but computational
linguistics readers should get this book only if
they want to do research on implementations
of spoken dialogue systems and be aware
of potential complications when designing
experiments that will use such systems.—

Applied Combinatorics on Words is a coherently
built sequence of chapters on the applications
of formal languages and automata theory,
particularly finite state. The term word in the
title refers to what often is called a string (or
ordered sequence) of symbols (from a finite
set). Combinatorics are the operations over

such strings and sets thereof, including algo-
rithms for, for example, recognition, manip-
ulation, combination, and matching of such
strings. The name Lothaire is a nom de plume
for a group of authors.
The book is meant primarily for mathemat-
ics and computer science students and schol-
ars. As the authors note in the preface to the
book, the book does not present formal lan-
guage and automata theory, and the reader is
referred to other, more suitable books. What
the book does provide is a mathematical (al-
beit limited) viewpoint on (formal) language
processing: It contains many of the standard
finite-state models, their representations, al-
gorithms, and statistical enrichments as of-
ten employed in morphological processing,
speech recognition, bioinformatics (applica-
tions on biological sequences), mathematics,
theoretical physics, and number theory.
Basically, there are two chapters on topics
related to computational linguistics: “Sym-
bolic natural language processing” (by E.
Laporte) and “Statistical natural language
processing” (by M. Mohri). The term nat-
ural language processing in both chapters refers
largely to processing at the (sub)word level
(morphological processing and speech recog-
nition, respectively). The chapter by Mohri
on statistical NLP constitutes an elegant in-
troduction to the mathematical formulation
of weighted automata (using semirings) and
their application within speech recognition,
and is highly recommended for the com-
putational linguistics student and scholar.
Unfortunately, the book contains little to
nothing about higher-level linguistic process-
ing (symbolic or statistical) as it has been
practiced in the computational linguistics
community over the last decade, e.g., statis-
tical parsing, statistical machine translation,
and other applications. Seen from a wide
computer science perspective, the book may
serve as a quick reference for standard math-
ematical definitions and algorithms on finite-
state automata and their many applications.
In short, this book could be of some inter-
est to a reader seeking a well-formulated but
dense overview of some of the major appli-
cations of weighted finite-state automata.—
