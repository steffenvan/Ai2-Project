A scheme is proposed for representing the logical form of English sentences, wherein
the meaning of a network node depends on how it is related through &amp;quot;role-in&amp;quot; links to
nodes representing more aggregate entities. It is argued that roles are a natural device for
capturing many linguistic and philosophic distinctions, and that they are convenient for
computational processing. In particular, it is shown how role-in links may be advantageous-
ly used in lieu of quantifier scope to represent quantificational dependencies.

In representing the semantics of English sentences,
it is traditional to distinguish &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot; from se-
mantic content. Chomsky [2], for instance, introduces
LF (his version of logical form) as a linguistic level of
representation between syntax (phrase structure) and
semantics.
Representations of logical form, which are typically
based on predicate calculus or lambda calculus, must
be carefully chosen for empirical adequacy as well as
computational convenience. There are at least three
general ways in which predicate or lambda calculus
might be carried over into representations of logical
form:
(la) directly (as by a theorem prover);
(lb) by replacing quantification with dynami-
cally scoped iteration procedures (as in
Woods [30]); or

(1c) by translating into a semantic network
formalism (as in Hendrix [10]).
The second and third are more process-oriented; that
is, they more closely relate elements of the representa-
tion and states in the interpretation process. In my
view, a process orientation is needed if issues of effi-
ciency are to be discussed at al1.2 One key to efficien-
cy is the delaying of decisions as long as possible.
This is easier to achieve when differences between
alternative interpretations are minimized
The two process-oriented approaches noted above
differ in their treatment of scope dependencies. For
example, we can model &amp;quot;each bottle&amp;quot; in

with a quantifier like (Vx: bottle), and then translate
that into an explicit FOR loop clause. Alternatively,
we can employ Skolem functions, with &amp;quot;wire&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;basket&amp;quot; modeled as functions of a variable ranging
over &amp;quot;bottle&amp;quot;. These functions and variables can then
be represented in a semantic network, along the lines
discussed in &amp;quot;What&apos;s in a Link?&amp;quot; [29].
I choose to adopt a particular semantic network
approach wherein it is more appropriate to view mean-
ings of nodes decompositionally (i.e., as dependent
upon what they are constituents of) rather than com-
positionally (i.e., as fully determined by the meanings

of their constituents). More specifically, the meaning
of a network node depends (decompositionally) on
how it is related though &amp;quot;role-in links&amp;quot; 3 to nodes rep-
resenting more aggregate entities. The decomposition-
al view is preferable for explaining a number of lin-
guistic phenomena. I will show, in this paper, that
many important linguistic and philosophical distinc-
tions can be analyzed as differences in role-in linkag-
es. Among these are the intensional/extensional,
referential/attributive, and distributive/collective dis-
tinctions.
My approach turns out to be more complex than
some, but I will argue that it captures subtle cases in a
more natural way and that it is superior for computa-
tional purposes. Indeed it has been my experience (as
in the development of MACSYMA [131) that a repre-
sentational formalism with more constructs often per-
mits more efficient processing than a formalism based
on a smaller set of more primitive operators. I suspect
that this experience will strike home with many read-
ers familiar with the difficulties encountered by
predicate-calculus-based theorem provers.

Figures la-lc illustrate the sort of semantic net-
work I use. (In these and subsequent figures, only
those nodes and links are shown that are relevant to
the issues under discussion. By convention, links with-
out arrowheads are to be taken as directed upwards.)
The networks shown in this figure have two kinds
of nodes, generic and individual, and three kinds of
links, inherits-from, may-be-described-as, and role-in.
Generic nodes (e.g. ARCH) represent generic objects;
individual nodes (e.g. ARCH-1 and ARCH-2) repre-
sent instances of generic objects. Inherits-from links
are used to say that the individuals ARCH-1 and
ARCH-2 inherit properties from the generic ARCH.
May-be-described-as links are used to indicate that an
ARCH is a STRUCTURE. 4 Finally, role-in links are
used to indicate that R1 and R2 are parts of the gen-
eric ARCH. The &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; of a node depends prima-
rily upon role-in links that connect it to nodes repre-
senting more aggregate entities.
My representation is similar to several in the litera-
ture. Generic nodes correspond to Minsky frames [16]
and roles (parts of generic objects) correspond to slots
(parts of frames). One can also draw analogies with
set theory. May-be-described-as links and inherits-
from are similar to set inclusion and set membership.

individuals. I consider the intension/extension distinc-
tion extremely important, because intensional repre-
sentations appear to be more natural for certain sen-
tences.5
My representation does not deal with contextual
problems by assuming a set of objects called contexts
(or partitions) and then somehow stipulating a context
link for each node. Instead, I argue that roles allow a
more natural modeling of the context phenomena. For
example, Figure 2 shows how Hendrix [10] represents
the fact that legal persons can own physical objects.
Rectangles (and squares) represent partitions
(contexts). An individual or set is in a partition if its
representing circle is in the rectangle representing that
partition. In this figure, the individual I is an implica-
tion that any individual owning X has an individual
agent Y, which is a legal person; an individual object
Z, which is a physical object; an individual start-time
t1, which is a time; and an individual end-time t2,
which is also a time.
This same information is shown in Figure 3, using
the notation presented here. Figure 3 eliminates the
individuals I and X, the implication node, the context
surrounding I, and the context surrounding Y, Z, t1,
and t2. Some of these are replaced in Figure 3 with a
richer variety of node types; I believe these types have
better linguistic and philosophical motivations than
Hendrix&apos;s abstract individuals, contexts, and implica-
tions.

Russell&apos;s [22] analysis of a singular definite descrip-
tion required the existence of a unique object satisfy-
ing the description in order for the expression to de-
note anything, and hence it fails to account for the
successful reference of a noun phrase like &apos;&apos;the clock&amp;quot;
in

Strawson [25] views these definite descriptions in
relativistic terms: even when the referent cannot be
determined in an absolute sense, as a particular clock
for example, the description still has some meaning
relative to whatever the context turns out to be.

almost all systems, intensional as well as extensional, are formally
adequate in the sense that they are capable of representing all

which or what particular is being referred to
by the subject expression in the second sen-
tence? We might say so. For, of a certain
range of two particulars the words &amp;quot;the man&amp;quot;
serve to distinguish the one being referred to,
by means of a description which applies only
to him. But though this is, in a weak sense,
a case of identification, I shall call it only a
story-relative or, for short, a relative identifi-
cation. For it is identification only relative
to a range of particulars (a range of two
members) which is itself identified only as
the range of particulars being talked about
by the speaker. That is to say, the hearer,
hearing the second sentence, knows which
particular creature is being referred to of the
two particular creatures being talked about by
the speaker; but he does not, without this
qualification, know what particular creature
is being referred to. The identification is
within a certain story told by a certain
speaker. It is identification within his story
but not identification within history.
Following this line of thought, sentence (5) might
be represented as follows, where clock-1 describes a
particular clock and the-clock-1 describes the clock
relative to the discourse.

Clock and Clock-1 are co-descriptors because they
both describe the same individual. (The term co-
description is chosen over co-reference or co-
denotation to avoid implications of intensionality and
existence.)
Co-description is appropriate in (7), but surely not
every occurrence of the-clock will refer to clock-1.

3.1 Referential and Attributive Use of
Definite Descriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999837329268293">
Donnellan [3] has suggested that definite descrip-
tions like &amp;quot;the clock&amp;quot; have two uses: referential and
attributive. Attributive use asserts something about
&amp;quot;whoever or whatever is the so-and-so&amp;quot;; referential
use is intended to allow the hearer to identify at once,
in his own terms, who or what is being talked about.
(10) I will call the two uses of definite descrip-
tions I have in mind the attributive use and
the referential use. A speaker who uses a
definite description attributively in an asser-
tion states something about whoever or
whatever is the so-and-so. A speaker who
uses a definite description referentially in an
assertion, on the other hand, uses the de-
scription to enable his audience to pick out
whom or what he is talking about and states
something about that person or thing. In the
first case the definite description might be
said to occur essentially, for the speaker
wishes to assert something about whatever or
whoever fits that description; but in the ref-
erential use the definite description is merely
one tool for doing a certain job— calling at-
tention to a person or thing— and in general
any other device for doing the same job, an-
other description or a name, would do as
well. In the attributive use, the attribute of
being the so-and-so is all important, while it
is not in the referential use.
To illustrate this distinction, in the case of
a single sentence, consider the sentence,
&amp;quot;Smith&apos;s murderer is insane&amp;quot;. Suppose first
that we come upon poor Smith foully mur-
dered. From the brutal manner of the killing
and the fact that Smith was the most lovable
person in the world, we might exclaim,
&amp;quot;Smith&apos;s murderer is insane&amp;quot;. I will assume,
to make it a simpler case, that in a quite or-
dinary sense we do not know who murdered
Smith (though this is not in the end essential
to the case). This I shall say, is an attrib-
utive use of the definite description.
The contrast with such a use of the sen-
tence is one of those situations in which we
expect and intend our audience to realize
whom we have in mind when we speak of
Smith&apos;s murderer and, most importantly, to
know that it is this person about whom we
are going to say something.
For example, suppose that Jones has been
charged with Smith&apos;s murder and has been
placed on trial. Imagine that there is a dis-
cussion of Jones&apos;s odd behavior at his trial.
We might sum up our impression of his be-
havior by saying, &amp;quot;Smith&apos;s murderer is in-
sane&amp;quot;. If someone asks to whom we are ref-
erring, by using this description, the answer
here is &amp;quot;Jones&amp;quot;. This, I shall say, is a refer-
ential use of the definite description.
The distinction is brought out nicely by the follow-
ing pair of sentences from Moore [17] and their corre-
sponding semantic net representations (Figures 4 and
5).
(11a) The President has been married
since 1945. referential
(lib) The President has lived in the
White House since 1800. attributive
Sentence (11a) refers to the person who is currently
President, while sentence (11 b) refers to whoever was
president at each point in time since 1800. The truth
of (11b) is not dependent on who is filling the role of
President. In fact, we can go even farther. In the
past the President has been killed and it has taken a
while to swear in the new President. During this time
there is no President, yet (11 b) is still true. In (11a),
by contrast, the referent of &amp;quot;the President&amp;quot;, president-
1, is not a role in &amp;quot;the President is married&amp;quot;, as shown
in Figure 4. Therefore, we are not at liberty to have
the referent change with time.6
The referential/attributive distinction might have
been ascribed to differences of scope in quantified
expressions.

My representation, in contrast, makes it easy for the
interpreter to delay the decision because it minimizes
the difference between the two cases. It is also possi-
ble for the interpreter never to decide which reading is
intended. For example, in a sentence such as, &amp;quot;The
president has owned a terrier since February,&amp;quot; the
listener will not be able to distinguish between the two
readings. If a later sentence requires the listener to
make a distinction, only a minimal alteration to the
representation is required. Partee [19] makes an argu-
ment that further supports this approach.

3.2 Subject Co-Descriptors (Verb Phrase Deletion)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933">
Both Figures 4 and 5 employ co-description be-
tween the-President and subject-of-x, where x is the
sentential predicate. Sentences (15a) and (15b) from
Sag [23] offer further support for this convention.

<listItem confidence="0.947974333333333">
(15a) The chickens are ready to eat, and the
children are too.
(15b) John likes flying planes, and Bill does too.

<bodyText confidence="0.999044">
In these examples, the subject plays the same role in
both conjuncts. That is, if the chickens are ready to
be eaten, then the children are also ready to be eaten,
and if the chickens are ready to do the eating, then the
children are ready to do the eating. However, (15a)
cannot mean that the chickens are ready to be eaten
and the children are ready to do the eating. Sentence
(15b) illustrates the same point. It is ambiguous
whether John likes to fly planes himself or whether he
would prefer someone else do the flying, but whichev-
er way he likes the flying done, Bill will want it done
the same way.
The following sentence from Partee [20] has the
same sort of ambiguity as (15a) and (15b) above; I
will use it to illustrate how such ambiguities are dealt
with in my scheme of representation.
(16) The prosecutor believed that he would
win the case, and so did the defense
attorney.
The missing verb phrase can be understood in two
ways, either that the defense attorney would win or
that the prosecutor would win. This can be explained
in terms of my representation, as shown in (17a) and
(17b) below. Note that he-1 is co-descriptive with the
subject role in (17a) and with the-prosecutor-1 in
(17b). Thus (17a) represents the sloppy attributive
interpretation where he-1 refers to whatever the sub-
ject happens to be, whereas (17b) represents the non-
sloppy referential interpretation where he-1 refers to
the-prosecutor-1 in both conjuncts.

Sentence (18a) has a non-restrictive relative clause,

70&amp;quot; is not used to pick out the uncle who is bald, but
just to give extra information about him. This sen-
tence is equivalent to the conjunction, &amp;quot;My uncle is
bald &amp; my uncle is 70.&amp;quot; By contrast, in the restrictive
reading (18b), &amp;quot;who is 70&amp;quot; picks out a particular un-

I prefer to represent quantified phrases in terms of
role-in links (interpretable as Skolem dependencies)
rather than iteration procedures, and to use predicates
on intensions and sets in addition to predicates on
individuals. By converting Woods&apos; FOR construct to
my notation, the difference between the two referen-
tial readings of &amp;quot;every boy wants a lion&amp;quot; can be
spelled out in more detail as shown in (24a) and (24b)
below. (Note that (24a) is a slight elaboration of
(22b), and that (24b) is identical to (22c)). (24a)
captures both the EVERY and GENeric options. In
both cases, lions are individuated by the boys who
want them. The individuating is represented by the
role-in link (Skolem modification) from lion-1 to
want-boy-lion-1.

The three readings (22a)-(22c) can be interpreted as
follows. In each case, want-a-lion must be true for
each boy. In (22a), a-lion-1 is attributive: it can be
picked as needed for each wanting. In (22b), a-lion-1
is referential, but it refers to a role in an iteration of
wanting at the discourse level. (Not surprisingly, giv-
en my account, this is a difficult reading for people to
construct.) Finally, (22c) gives the by-now-familiar
referential case where every boy is constrained to
wanting the same lion.7 Let us now turn to a discus-
sion of the discourse iteration construct used in (22b).

4.1 Procedural Representation of Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.847881647058823">
By procedural representation of knowledge, I mean
knowledge in the form of procedures. For example,
the knowledge that every boy wants a lion could be
cast in the form &amp;quot;if one were to check every boy in
question and count those who want lions, then the
count of those who want lions would be equal to the
count of the boys checked&amp;quot;. Woods [30] introduced a
FOR iteration construct for representing knowledge of
quantified propositions procedurally.8 Examples of the
use of this construct are:
7 Partee [19] points out that this type of sentence and those
of the previous section pose a problem for the analysis of the indef-
inite article in terms of the features +specific [7]. Something more
is needed to produce all the readings. Features can be used as
follows: if a hearer has decided a node is definitely attributive it
can be marked +attributive, if it is referential the co-descriptor is
shown. Otherwise, it is unmarked and has no co-descriptor.

8 Readers familiar with iteration macros and programming

limited to a single variable. I use it here because it is simple, is well
explained by Woods, and will facilitate comparison of my sugges-
tions with Woods&apos; earlier work.

In contrast to (24a), (24b) contains no iteration at all.
In this case, all the boys want the same lion. Since
lions are not individuated with respect to boys, there is
no motivation to introduce an iteration (or Skolem
dependency). On this reading, &amp;quot;every boy wants a
lion&amp;quot; can be conceptualized just like &amp;quot;a boy wants a
lion&amp;quot;.

4.2 Collectives, Distributives, and Pluralities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993060681818182">
In applying predicates to pluralities, we must be
careful not to confuse a predicate on a plurality with a
predicate on a collective. If a process, like wanting, is
done by a plurality, then a plurality of wantings oc-
curs. This contrasts with a collective, which acts as a
single unit. Fauconnier [5] demonstrates this distinc-
tion with (25).
(25a) The men {gathered, united, quarreled}. collective
(25b) The men took off their hats. distributive
(25c) The men carried the couch. plurality
As a further example, observe that in
(26) Everybody gave $1000 to many of the men.
we must decide whether the men receiving money
receive $1000 apiece or just participate in a group
receiving $1000. We must also decide whether
&amp;quot;everybody&amp;quot; acted individually or collectively. Note
that one cannot personally receive $1000 if $1000 is
given to a group he is in, but one can be personally
told the news if the news is told to a group he is in.
From this we see that the distributive reading may or
may not require a separate instance of some state or
process for each individual.
A plural noun group may be understood in any of
the three ways. Vendler [27] gives examples intended
to show that the choice between &amp;quot;each&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;every&amp;quot;
influences our preferences.
(27) Suppose I show you a basket of apples and I
tell you, &amp;quot;Take all of them&amp;quot;. If you started
to pick them one by one I should be sur-
prised. My offer was sweeping: you should
take the apples, if possible, &amp;quot;en bloc&amp;quot;. Had I
said, &amp;quot;Take every one of them,&amp;quot; I should not
care how you took them, provided you do
not leave any behind. If I say, &amp;quot;Take each of
them,&amp;quot; one feels that the sentence is unfin-
ished. Something like, &amp;quot;Take each of them
and examine them in turn,&amp;quot; is expected.
Thus I expect you to take them one after the
other not missing any.
&amp;quot;All&amp;quot; favors collective interpretation, but permits dis-
tributive interpretation. &amp;quot;Every&amp;quot; favors distributive
interpretation. &amp;quot;Each&amp;quot; strongly favors distributive
interpretation and favors distinct actions for each indi-
vidual.

4.3 Multiple Iterations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999215">
The previous sections suggested that an iteration
need be constructed only when two descriptions in the
sentence are related in a special way, e.g., where one
is individuated by the other. Otherwise, predicates on
collectives or pluralities provide an adequate descrip-
tion. In this way, I avoid iteration, which -is relatively
expensive from a computational perspective. There
are other ways to eliminate iterations. For example,
the apparent double iteration in sentence (28a) can be
reduced to a single iteration. Formula (28b) repre-
sents the natural reading where each cork is associated
with one bottle. It might appear that it requires two
nested FOR loops as in (28c), but in fact, it can be
implemented with a single loop (28d).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.817121923076923">
(28a) Each cork is fastened to each bottle by a
small wire basket.
(28b) (ix) (Vy) if x is a cork &amp; y is a bottle
&amp; x is the cork in bottle y
then x is fastened to y by a small
wire basket.
(28c) Forall x in corks do two nested loops
Forall y in bottles
if x is the cork in bottle y then
x is fastened to y by a small wire basket.
(28d) Forall y in bottles do single loop
let x = the cork in bottle y
x is fastened to y by a small wire basket.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.879671">
Most people understand this sentence by iterating over
bottles and individuating the corks by the bottles. The
single loop implementation can be derived straightfor-
wardly from my representation. In some other repre-
sentation, it may require a very clever compiler optimi-
zation, such as &amp;quot;loop jamming&amp;quot;.
Sentences (29a) and (29b) are similar to (28a) in
this respect.

<listItem confidence="0.948704666666667">
(29a) All the boys kissed all the girls.

These sentences provide evidence that a quantifier like
&amp;quot;each&amp;quot; doesn&apos;t necessarily set up an iteration. It usu-
ally does, and therefore these sentences are a bit odd.

In the previous example we could have had each

obvious how an iteration should be constructed.
When someone hears the statement
(30) A requirement for the course is the carv-
ing of a block of wood into each of the
12 designs.
his reasoning might be as follows: &amp;quot;Well, let&apos;s see.
We take the wood and carve the first design. (He
pursues the distributive referential reading with one
block.) Oh! Oh! Now how do we carve a second de-
sign, the block is used up. Well, maybe we could fit
the twelve designs on one block, or we could cut the
block into twelve pieces. Or maybe I should abandon
the referential reading and use twelve blocks.&amp;quot; There
can be no doubt that world knowledge (pragmatics) is
required to choose between such readings. Consider
now the following pair of sentences.

Everyone at a university might conceivably know the

Van Lehn [26] reports that when people are given
a sentence like
(32) A quick test confirmed that every drug

they claim they understand it, but are then unable to
state whether there was one test per drug or only one
test for all. This ambiguity can be expressed in predi-
cate calculus using quantifiers.

But in my representation, the ambiguity is represented
by the presence or absence of a role-in link, which
makes it easy to delay disambiguation. There is no
shuffling of quantifiers to shift between the two inter-
pretations; instead, disambiguation is achieved by sim-
ply inserting a role-in link, when and if appropriate.

points out that it is uncertain whether &amp;quot;a quick test
confirmed that every drug was psychoactive&amp;quot; has a
general sense. The general sense of &amp;quot;boat&amp;quot; is resolved
semantically — by choosing between more specific
concepts such as &amp;quot;sailboat&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;motorboat&amp;quot;. If (35)
does have a general sense it might be resolved seman-
tically, but it might also be resolved pragmatically —
by binding the concept into the discourse structure in
different ways. Philosophers have largely ignored this
issue since they have been interested in formal lan-
guages whose terms are logically unambiguous. Van
Lehn&apos;s results would tend to indicate that people do
have a general sense of this expression.
The advantage of the representational scheme pro-
posed here is that it allows the resolution of ambiguity
by incrementally adding to what is already present.
We have discussed many reasons why scoping deci-
sions should be delayed, ranging from computational
efficiency to Van Lehn&apos;s empirical observations.
Role-in links provide a simple way to accomplish this.

5. Conclusion: The Asymmetry of Roles
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999704461538461">
Roles introduce a very interesting asymmetry. In
my representation, the meaning of a node depends on
its roles in more aggregate entities, not just on its
constituents. For example, I use role-in links as Sko-
lem modifiers where others have employed quantifier
scope. In this way, I can represent quantificational
dependencies as role-in links to nodes representing
more aggregate entities. I have argued that roles are a
natural device for explaining many linguistic and philo-
sophical distinctions, and they are convenient for com-
putational processing.
Section 3 showed how roles can help represent
referring expressions. The referential/attributive dis-

tinction was formulated in terms of roles so that the
attributive use asserts something as a role in such-and-
such whereas the referential use asserts something as
being the such-and-such without a role dependency. I
choose to use roles where others (e.g. Moore) have
employed scope dependencies, because the ambiguity
persists even when the scoping context is unavailable,
as in &amp;quot;The president has owned a terrier since Febru-
ary&amp;quot;. In this way, I can delay the binding decision
because I can represent the dependencies (or lack
thereof) without hypothesizing an outer context.
Furthermore, I have argued that verb phrase dele-
tion provides additional support for the claim that role
dependencies are associated with references, not with
contexts. That is, in a sentence like &amp;quot;The prosecutor
believed that he would win the case, and so did the
defense attorney&amp;quot;, there are two ways to interpret
&amp;quot;he&amp;quot;: as a co-descriptor of the subject or as a co-
descriptor of the prosecutor. Note that whichever way
it is taken in the first conjunct, it will be taken the
same way in the second. There is a natural explana-
tion for this if the co-description dependency is associ-
ated with the reference &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;, whereas in a system
where this dependency was associated with the con-
text, an ad hoc stipulation would be required.
Section 4 argued that quantifier dependencies
should be associated with references as opposed to
contexts. My approach leads to a natural representa-
tion for collectives, distributives, and pluralities. By
minimizing the differences in the representation of
these three cases, an interpreter is in a better position
to delay binding decisions. This is consistent with Van
Lehn&apos;s empirical observations. Furthermore collec-
tives and pluralities can be interpreted without itera-
tion, saving considerable processing effort.

member of the Association for Computational linguistics, died Tuesday, June 2, 1981,
after an extended illness. He was 43.
Bill Martin managed to crowd into an all-too-short life three distinct research
careers. After receiving his doctorate from MIT, he, in association with Joel Moses, led
the MACSYMA development project. MACSYMA, a computer system for applied
mathematicians, has become one of the few large applied-AI systems that have ever-
growing user communities. He then switched into the field of automatic programming,
where he was responsible for developing the PROTOSYSTEM automatic programming
system. This effort culminated in the development of HIBOL, a high-level business-
oriented language. Changing fields once again, Bill became an expert in computational
linguistics, concentrating on problems in parsing and knowledge representation.
Bill&apos;s involvement with computational linguistics was triggered by the need he
perceived for a natural language interface to PROTOSYSTEM. His early efforts in this
area began with an investigation of the structure of dialogues. This led to the develop-
ment of first MAPL and later OWL as formal languages for representing knowledge of
English, of the application domain, and of PROTOSYSTEM&apos;s procedures. Subsequent-
ly, the problems of English language processing came to be the focal point of his work,
motivating his full concentration on computational linguistics during the last few years.
Bill&apos;s foremost talents were his ability to acquire an immense knowledge of both the
most significant and the most intricate problems of any domain that he chose to focus
on and his ability to forge and maintain a large coherent research project. His attention
has alternated between these two somewhat dissimilar motifs, as individual researcher
and as project head. He was a first-rate engineer throughout, one who believed and put
into practice the notion that good engineering principles could be used to resolve all
scientific and application problems. Believing in the notion of a &amp;quot;small infinity,&amp;quot; Bill
demonstrated, on many occasions, that seemingly unbounded problems will succumb to
the careful analysis of their hundreds of cases, when the &amp;quot;infinity&amp;quot; of their complexity is
indeed only on the order of hundreds.
Bill was a native of Oklahoma City, graduating from Northwest Classen High School,
where he made his mark as a wrestler as well as a student. He was an Oklahoma state
wrestling champion, and continued his active interest in athletics as an undergraduate at
MIT, where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He received the bachelor&apos;s,
master&apos;s, and PhD degrees from MIT in 1960, 1962, and 1967, respectively, all in
electrical engineering, and was appointed to the MIT faculty in 1968.
He survived by his wife, Susan Y. Forbes Martin; three children, Jamie, Tad, and
Jon; his parents Earl and Barbara Martin of Oklahoma City; and a sister Jane Anne
Slane, also of Oklahoma City. A memorial fund has been established in Professor
Martin&apos;s name by the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at
MIT. It will award an annual prize for the best MIT undergraduate thesis in computer
science.

Introduction In representing the semantics of English sentences, it is traditional to distinguish &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot; from semantic content. Chomsky [2], for instance, introduces LF (his version of logical form) as a linguistic level of representation between syntax (phrase structure) and semantics. Representations of logical form, which are typically based on predicate calculus or lambda calculus, must be carefully chosen for empirical adequacy as well as computational convenience. There are at least three general ways in which predicate or lambda calculus might be carried over into representations of logical form: (la) directly (as by a theorem prover); (lb) by replacing quantification with dynamically scoped iteration procedures (as in Woo</context>

Since lions are not individuated with respect to boys, there is no motivation to introduce an iteration (or Skolem dependency). On this reading, &amp;quot;every boy wants a lion&amp;quot; can be conceptualized just like &amp;quot;a boy wants a lion&amp;quot;. 4.2 Collectives, Distributives, and Pluralities In applying predicates to pluralities, we must be careful not to confuse a predicate on a plurality with a predicate on a collective. If a process, like wanting, is done by a plurality, then a plurality of wantings occurs. This contrasts with a collective, which acts as a single unit. Fauconnier [5] demonstrates this distinction with (25). (25a) The men {gathered, united, quarreled}. collective (25b) The men took off their hats. distributive (25c) The men carried the couch. plurality As a further example, observe that in (26) Everybody gave $1000 to many of the men. we must decide whether the men receiving money receive $1000 apiece or just participate in a group receiving $1000.

Reference and Definite Descriptions Russell&apos;s [22] analysis of a singular definite description required the existence of a unique object satisfying the description in order for the expression to denote anything, and hence it fails to account for the successful reference of a noun phrase like &apos;&apos;the clock&amp;quot; in (5) Did you wind the clock? Strawson [25] views these definite descriptions in relativistic terms: even when the referent cannot be determined in an absolute sense, as a particular clock for example, the description still has some meaning relative to whatever the context turns out to be. (6) When shall we say that a hearer knows what particular is being referred to by a speaker? Consider first the following case. A speaker tells a story which he claims to be factual. It begins, &amp;quot;A man and a boy were standing by a fountain,&amp;quot; and it continues: &amp;quot;The man had a drink&amp;quot;. Shall we say that the hearer knows 5 I choose to avoid the question of formal adequacy because almost all systems, intensional as well as extensional, are formally adequate in the sense that they are capable of representing all (effective) functions.

Woods [30] introduced a FOR iteration construct for representing knowledge of quantified propositions procedurally.8 Examples of the use of this construct are: 7 Partee [19] points out that this type of sentence and those of the previous section pose a problem for the analysis of the indefinite article in terms of the features +specific [7]. Something more is needed to produce all the readings.

I consider the intension/extension distinction extremely important, because intensional representations appear to be more natural for certain sentences.5 My representation does not deal with contextual problems by assuming a set of objects called contexts (or partitions) and then somehow stipulating a context link for each node. Instead, I argue that roles allow a more natural modeling of the context phenomena. For example, Figure 2 shows how Hendrix [10] represents the fact that legal persons can own physical objects. Rectangles (and squares) represent partitions (contexts). An individual or set is in a partition if its representing circle is in the rectangle representing that partition. In this figure, the individual I is an implication that any individual owning X has an individual agent Y, which is a legal person; an individual object Z, which is a physical object; an individual start-time t1, which is a time; and an individual end-time t2, which is also a time.

My representation, in contrast, makes it easy for the interpreter to delay the decision because it minimizes the difference between the two cases. It is also possible for the interpreter never to decide which reading is intended. For example, in a sentence such as, &amp;quot;The president has owned a terrier since February,&amp;quot; the listener will not be able to distinguish between the two readings. If a later sentence requires the listener to make a distinction, only a minimal alteration to the representation is required. Partee [19] makes an argument that further supports this approach.

For example, suppose that Jones has been charged with Smith&apos;s murder and has been placed on trial. Imagine that there is a discussion of Jones&apos;s odd behavior at his trial. We might sum up our impression of his behavior by saying, &amp;quot;Smith&apos;s murderer is insane&amp;quot;. If someone asks to whom we are referring, by using this description, the answer here is &amp;quot;Jones&amp;quot;. This, I shall say, is a referential use of the definite description. The distinction is brought out nicely by the following pair of sentences from Moore [17] and their corresponding semantic net representations (Figures 4 and 5).

My representation, in contrast, makes it easy for the interpreter to delay the decision because it minimizes the difference between the two cases. It is also possible for the interpreter never to decide which reading is intended. For example, in a sentence such as, &amp;quot;The president has owned a terrier since February,&amp;quot; the listener will not be able to distinguish between the two readings. If a later sentence requires the listener to make a distinction, only a minimal alteration to the representation is required. Partee [19] makes an argument that further supports this approach.

However, (15a) cannot mean that the chickens are ready to be eaten and the children are ready to do the eating. Sentence (15b) illustrates the same point. It is ambiguous whether John likes to fly planes himself or whether he would prefer someone else do the flying, but whichever way he likes the flying done, Bill will want it done the same way. The following sentence from Partee [20] has the same sort of ambiguity as (15a) and (15b) above; I will use it to illustrate how such ambiguities are dealt with in my scheme of representation. (16) The prosecutor believed that he would win the case, and so did the defense attorney. The missing verb phrase can be understood in two ways, either that the defense attorney would win or that the prosecutor would win. This can be explained in terms of my representation, as shown in (17a) and (17b) below. Note that he-1 is co-descriptive with the subject role in (17a) and with the-prosecutor-1 in (17b).

Discourse Iteration We have seen that explicit nesting of structural descriptions can explain the referential/attributive distinction, sloppy binding, and restrictive/descriptive relative clauses.

Note that one cannot personally receive $1000 if $1000 is given to a group he is in, but one can be personally told the news if the news is told to a group he is in. From this we see that the distributive reading may or may not require a separate instance of some state or process for each individual. A plural noun group may be understood in any of the three ways.
