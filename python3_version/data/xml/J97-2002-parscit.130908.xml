The sentence is a standard textual unit in natural language processing applications. In many
languages the punctuation mark that indicates the end-of-sentence boundary is ambiguous; thus
the tokenizers of most NLP systems must be equipped with special sentence boundary recognition
rules for every new text collection.
As an alternative, this article presents an efficient, trainable system for sentence boundary
disambiguation. The system, called Satz, makes simple estimates of the parts of speech of the
tokens immediately preceding and following each punctuation mark, and uses these estimates as
input to a machine learning algorithm that then classifies the punctuation mark. Satz is very
fast both in training and sentence analysis, and its combined robustness and accuracy surpass
existing techniques. The system needs only a small lexicon and training corpus, and has been
shown to transfer quickly and easily from English to other languages, as demonstrated on French
and German.

Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the availability of on-line text collections,
which are useful in many areas of computational linguistics research. One active area
of research is the development of algorithms for aligning sentences in parallel corpora.
The success of most natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, including multi-
lingual sentence alignment algorithms (Kay and Roscheisen 1993; Gale and Church
1993),1 part-of-speech taggers (Cutting et al. 1991), and parsers, depends on prior
knowledge of the location of sentence boundaries.
Segmenting a text into sentences is a nontrivial task, however, since in English
and many other languages the end-of-sentence punctuation marks are ambiguous.&apos;
A period, for example, can denote a decimal point, an abbreviation, the end of a
sentence, or even an abbreviation at the end of a sentence. Exclamation points and
question marks can occur within quotation marks or parentheses as well as at the end
of a sentence. Ellipsis, a series of periods (...), can occur both within sentences and at

1 There is some recent research in aligning bilingual corpora without relying on sentence boundaries
(Fung and Church 1994; Fang and McKeown 1994).
2 In this article, we will consider only the period, the exclamation point, and the question mark to be
possible &amp;quot;end-of-sentence punctuation marks,&amp;quot; and all references to &amp;quot;punctuation marks&amp;quot; will refer to
these three. Although the colon, the semicolon, and conceivably the comma can also delimit
grammatical sentences, their usage is beyond the scope of this work.

The existence of punctuation in grammatical subsentences suggests the possibility
of a further decomposition of the sentence boundary problem into types of sentence
boundaries, one of which would be &amp;quot;embedded sentence boundary.&amp;quot; Such a distinction
might be useful for certain applications that analyze the grammatical structure of
the sentence. However, in this work we will only address the simpler problem of
determining boundaries between sentences, finding that which Nunberg (1990) calls
the &amp;quot;text-sentence.&amp;quot;
In examples (1-4), the word immediately preceding and the word immediately
following a punctuation mark provide important information about its role in the
sentence. However, more context may be necessary, such as when punctuation occurs
in a subsentence within quotation marks or parentheses, as seen in example (2), or
when an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, as seen in (5a):
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.5233295">

(5)b. She has an appointment at 5 p.m. Saturday to get her car fixed.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999728217391304">
Examples (5a-b) also show some problems inherent in relying on brittle features,
such as capitalization, when determining sentence boundaries. The initial capital in
Saturday does not necessarily indicate that Saturday is the first word in the sentence.
As a more dramatic example, some important kinds of text consist only of upper-case
letters, thus thwarting any system that relies on capitalization rules. Another obstacle
to systems that rely on brittle features is that many texts are not well-formed. One
such class of texts are those that are the output of optical character recognition (OCR);
typically these texts contain many extraneous or incorrect characters.
This article presents an efficient, trainable system for sentence boundary disam-
biguation that circumvents these obstacles. The system, called Satz, makes simple
estimates of the parts of speech of the tokens immediately preceding and following
each punctuation mark, and uses these estimates as input to a machine learning al-
gorithm that determines whether the punctuation mark is a sentence boundary or
serves another purpose in the sentence. Satz is very fast in both training and sentence
analysis; training is accomplished in less than one minute on a workstation, and it can
process 10,000 sentences per minute. The combined robustness and accuracy of the
system surpasses existing techniques, consistently producing an error rate less than
1.5% on a range of corpora and languages. It requires only a small lexicon (which can
be less than 5,000 words) and a training corpus of 300-500 sentences.
The following sections discuss related work and the criteria used to evaluate such
work, describe our system in detail, and present the results of applying the system to
a variety of texts. The transferability of the system from English to other languages is
also demonstrated on French and German text. Finally, the learning-based system is

2.1 Evaluation of Related Work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960170731707">
An important consideration when discussing related work is the mode of evaluation.
To aid our evaluation, we define a lower bound, an objective score which any reason-
able algorithm should be able to match or better. In our test collections, the ambiguous
punctuation mark is used much more often as a sentence boundary marker than for
any other purpose. Therefore, a very simple, successful algorithm is one in which ev-
ery potential boundary marker is labeled as the end-of-sentence. Thus, for the task of
sentence boundary disambiguation, we define the lower bound of a text collection as
the percentage of possible sentence-ending punctuation marks in the text that indeed
denote sentence boundaries.
Since the use of abbreviations in a text depends on the particular text and text
genre, the number of ambiguous punctuation marks, and the corresponding lower
bound, will vary dramatically depending on text genre. For example, Liberman and
Church (1992) report on a Wall Street Journal corpus containing 14,153 periods per
million tokens, whereas in the Tagged Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982), the
figure is only 10,910 periods per million tokens. Liberman and Church also report that
47% of the periods in the WSJ corpus denote abbreviations (thus a lower bound of
53%), compared to only 10% in the Brown corpus (lower bound 90%) (Riley 1989). In
contrast, Muller, Amerl, and Natalis (1980) reports lower bound statistics ranging from
54.7% to 92.8% within a corpus of scientific abstracts. Such a range of lower bound
figures suggests the need for a robust approach that can adapt rapidly to different text
requirements.
Another useful evaluation technique is the comparison of a new algorithm against
a strong baseline algorithm. The baseline algorithm should perform better than the
lower bound and should represent a strong effort or a standard method for solving
the problem at hand.
Although sentence boundary disambiguation is an essential preprocessing step of
many natural language processing systems, it is a topic rarely addressed in the litera-
ture and there are few public-domain programs for performing the segmentation task.
For our studies we compared our system against the results of the UNIX STYLE pro-
gram (Cherry and Vesterman 1991).3 The STYLE program, which attempts to provide
a stylistic profile of writing at the word and sentence level, reports the length and
structure for all sentences in a document, thereby indicating the sentence boundaries.
STYLE defines a sentence as a string of words ending in one of: period, exclamation
point, question mark, or backslash-period (the latter of which can be used by an au-
thor to mark an imperative sentence ending). The program handles numbers with
embedded decimal points and commas and makes use of an abbreviation list with 48
entries. It also uses the following heuristic: initials cause a sentence break only if the
next word begins with a capital letter and is found in a dictionary of function words.
In an evaluation on a sample of 20 documents, the developers of the program found
it to incorrectly classify sentence boundaries 204 times out of 3287 possible (an error
rate of 6.3%).

2.2 Regular Expressions and Heuristic Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962133333334">
The method currently widely used for determining sentence boundaries is a regu-
lar grammar, usually with limited lookahead. In the simplest implementation of this
method, the grammar rules attempt to find patterns of characters, such as &amp;quot;period-
space-capital letter,&amp;quot; which usually occur at the end of a sentence. More elaborate
implementations, such as the STYLE program discussed above, consider the entire
word preceding and following the punctuation mark and include extensive word lists
and exception lists to attempt to recognize abbreviations and proper nouns. There are
a few examples of rule-based and heuristic systems for which performance numbers
are available, discussed in the remainder of this subsection.
The Alembic information extraction system (Aberdeen et al. 1995) contains a very
extensive regular-expression-based sentence boundary disambiguation module, cre-
ated using the lexical scanner generator Flex (Nicol 1993). The boundary disambigua-
tion module is part of a comprehensive preprocess pipeline that utilizes a list of 75
abbreviations and a series of over 100 hand-crafted rules to identify sentence bound-
aries, as well as titles, date and time expressions, and abbreviations. The sentence
boundary module was developed over the course of more than six staff months. On
the Wall Street Journal corpus described in Section 4, Alembic achieved an error rate
of 0.9%.
Christiane Hoffmann (1994) used a regular expression approach to classify punctu-
ation marks in a corpus of the German newspaper die tageszeitung with a lower bound
(as defined above) of 92%. She used the UNIX tool LEX (Lesk and Schmidt 1975)
and a large abbreviation list to classify occurrences of periods. Her method incorrectly
classified less than 2% of the sentence boundaries when tested on 2,827 periods from
the corpus. The method was developed specifically for the tageszeitung corpus, and
Hoffmann reports that success in applying her method to other corpora would be de-
pendent on the quality of the available abbreviation lists. Her work would therefore
probably not be easily transportable to other corpora or languages.
Mark Wasson and colleagues invested nine staff months developing a system that
recognizes special tokens (e.g., nondictionary terms such as proper names, legal statute
citations, etc.) as well as sentence boundaries. From this, Wasson built a stand-alone
boundary recognizer in the form of a grammar converted into finite automata with
1,419 states and 18,002 transitions (excluding the lexicon). The resulting system, when
tested on 20 megabytes of news and case law text, achieved an error rate of 0.3% at
speeds of 80,000 characters per CPU second on a mainframe computer. When tested
against upper-case legal text the system still performed very well, achieving error
rates of 0.3% and 1.8% on test data of 5,305 and 9,396 punctuation marks, respectively.
According to Wasson, it is not likely, however, that the results would be this strong
on lower-case-only data.&apos;
Although the regular grammar approach can be successful, it requires a large
manual effort to compile the individual rules used to recognize the sentence bound-
aries. Such efforts are usually developed specifically for a text corpus (Liberman and
Church 1992; Hoffmann 1994) and would probably not be portable to other text gen-
res. Because of their reliance on special language-specific word lists, they are also not
portable to other natural languages without repeating the effort of compiling exten-
sive lists and rewriting rules. In addition, heuristic approaches depend on having a

well-behaved corpus with regular punctuation and few extraneous characters, and
they would probably not be very successful with texts obtained via optical character
recognition (OCR).
Muller, Amen, and Natalis (1980) provides an exhaustive analysis of sentence
boundary disambiguation as it relates to lexical endings and the identification of ab-
breviations and words surrounding a punctuation mark, focusing on text written in
English. This approach makes multiple passes through the data to find recognizable
suffixes and thereby filters out words that are not likely to be abbreviations. The mor-
phological analysis makes it possible to identify words not otherwise present in the
extensive word lists used to identify abbreviations. Error rates of 2-5% are reported
for this method tested on over 75,000 scientific abstracts, with lower bounds ranging
from 54.7% to 92.8%.

2.3 Approaches Using Machine Learning
</subsectionHeader>

There have been two other published attempts to apply machine-learning techniques
to the sentence boundary disambiguation task. Both make use of the words in the
context found around the punctuation mark.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9734421">
2.3.1 Regression Trees. Riley (1989) describes an approach that uses regression trees
(Breiman et al. 1984) to classify periods according to the following features:
• Probability[word preceding &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; occurs at end of sentence]
• Probability[word following &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; occurs at beginning of sentence]
• Length of word preceding &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;
• Length of word after &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;
• Case of word preceding &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;: Upper, Lower, Cap, Numbers
• Case of word following &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;: Upper, Lower, Cap, Numbers
• Punctuation after &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; (if any)
• Abbreviation class of words with &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999680230769231">
The method uses information about one word of context on either side of the
punctuation mark and thus must record, for every word in the lexicon, the probability
that it occurs next to a sentence boundary. Probabilities were compiled from 25 million
words of prelabeled training data from a corpus of AP newswire. The probabilities
were actually estimated for the beginning and end of paragraphs rather than for all
sentences, since paragraph boundaries were explicitly marked in the AP corpus, while
the sentence boundaries were not. The resulting classification tree was used to identify
whether a word ending in a period is at the end of a declarative sentence in the Brown
corpus, and achieved an error rate of 0.2%.5 Although this is an impressive error rate,
the amount of training data (25 million words) required is prohibitive for a problem
that acts as a preprocessing step to other natural language processing tasks; it would
be impractical to expect this amount of data to be available for every corpus and
language to be tagged.

3. The Satz System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999414">
This section describes the structure of our adaptive sentence boundary disambiguation
system, known as Satz.&apos; The Satz system represents the context surrounding a punc-
tuation mark as a sequence of vectors, where the vector constructed for each context
word represents an estimate of the part-of-speech distribution for the word, obtained
from a lexicon containing part-of-speech frequency data. This use of part-of-speech
estimates of the context words, rather than the words themselves, is a unique aspect
of the Satz system, and is responsible in large part for its efficiency and effectiveness.
The context vectors, which we call descriptor arrays, are input to a machine learn-
ing algorithm trained to disambiguate sentence boundaries. The output of the learning
algorithm is then used to determine the role of the punctuation mark in the sentence.
The architecture of the system is shown in Figure 1. The Satz system works in two
modes—learning mode and disambiguation mode. In learning mode, the input text
is a training text with all sentence boundaries manually labeled, and the parameters
in the learning algorithm are dynamically adjusted during training. Once learning
mode is completed, the parameters in the learning algorithm remain fixed. Training
of the learning algorithm is therefore necessary only once for each language, although
training can be repeated for a new corpus or genre within a language, if desired. In
disambiguation mode, the input is the text whose sentence boundaries have not been
marked up yet and need to be disambiguated.
The essence of the Satz system lies in how machine learning is used, rather than
in which particular method is used. In this article we report results using two different
learning methods: neural networks and decision trees. The two methods are almost
equally effective for this task, and both train and run quickly using small resources.
For some applications, one may be more appropriate than another, (e.g., the scores
produced by a neural net may be useful for another processing step in a natural
language program), so we do not consider either learning algorithm to be the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot;
one to use. Therefore, when we refer to the Satz system, we refer to the use of machine
learning with a small training corpus, representing the word context surrounding each
punctuation mark in terms of estimates of the parts of speech of those words, where
these estimates are derived from a very small lexicon.

3.1 Tokenization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985666666667">
The first stage of the process is lexical analysis, which breaks the input text (a stream
of characters) into tokens. The Satz tokenizer is implemented using the UNIX tool
LEX (Lesk and Schmidt 1975) and is modeled on the tokenizer used by the PARTS
part-of-speech tagger (Church 1988). The tokens returned by the LEX program can
be a sequence of alphabetic characters, a sequence of digits,8 or a sequence of one or
more non-alphanumeric characters such as periods or quotation marks.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999224">
3.2 Part-of-Speech Lookup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.916858421052632">
The individual tokens are next assigned a series of possible parts of speech, based on
a lexicon and simple heuristics described below.
3.2.1 Representing Context. The context surrounding a punctuation mark can be rep-
resented in various ways. The most straightforward is to use the individual words
preceding and following the punctuation mark, as in this example:
at the plant. He had thought
Using this approach, a representation of an individual word&apos;s position in a context
must be made for every word in the language. Compiling these representations for
each word is undesirable due to the large amount of training data, training time, and
storage overhead required, especially since it is unlikely that such information will be
useful to later stages of processing.
As an alternative, the context could be approximated by using a single part of
speech for each word. The above context would then be represented by the following
part-of-speech sequence:
preposition article noun
pronoun verb verb
However, requiring a single part-of-speech assignment for each word introduces a
processing circularity: because most part-of-speech taggers require predetermined sen-
tence boundaries, the boundary disambiguation must be done before tagging. But if

<footnote confidence="0.9064945">

the disambiguation is done before tagging, no part-of-speech assignments are avail-
able for the boundary-determination system. To avoid this circularity, we approximate
each word&apos;s part of speech in one of two ways: (1) by the prior probabilities of all
parts of speech for that word, or (2) by a binary value for each possible part of speech
for that word.
In the case of prior probabilities, each word in the context is represented by the
probability that the word occurs as each part of speech, with all part-of-speech prob-
abilities in the vector summing to 1.0. Continuing the example, the context becomes
(and for simplicity, suppressing the parts of speech with value 0.0):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9998345">
preposition(1.0) article(1.0) noun(0.8)/verb(0.2)
pronoun(1.0) verb(1.0) noun(0.1)/verb(0.9)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939">
This denotes that at and the have a probability of 1.0 of occurring as a preposition
and article respectively, plant has a probability of 0.8 of occurring as a noun and a
probability of 0.2 of occurring as a verb, and so on. These probabilities, which are
more accurately &amp;quot;scaled frequencies,&amp;quot; are based on occurrences of the words in a
pretagged corpus, and are therefore corpus dependent.&apos;
In the case of binary part-of-speech assignment, for each possible part of speech,
the vector is assigned the value 1 if the word can ever occur as that part of speech
(according to the lexicon), and the value 0 if it cannot. In this case the sum of all items
in the vector is not predefined, as it is with probabilities. Continuing the example with
binary POS vectors (and, for simplicity, suppressing the parts of speech with value 0),
the context becomes:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99999">
preposition(1) article(1) noun(1)/verb(1)
pronoun(1) verb(1) noun(1)/verb(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.980202111111111">
The part-of-speech data necessary to construct probabilistic and binary vectors
is often present in the lexicon of a part-of-speech tagger or other existing NLP tool,
or it can easily be obtained from word lists; the data would thus be readily avail-
able and would not require excessive storage overhead. It is also possible to estimate
part-of-speech data for new or unknown words. For these reasons, we chose to ap-
proximate the context in our system by using the prior part-of-speech information. In
Section 4.7 we give the results of a comparative study of system performance with
both probabilistic and binary part-of-speech vectors.
3.2.2 The Lexicon. An important component of the Satz system is the lexicon contain-
ing part-of-speech frequency data from which the descriptor arrays are constructed.
Words in the lexicon are followed by a series of part-of-speech tags and associated
frequencies, representing the possible parts of speech for that word and the frequency
with which the word occurs as each part of speech. The frequency information can
be obtained in various ways, as discussed in the previous section. The lexical lookup
stage of the Satz system finds a word in the lexicon (if it is present) and returns the
possible parts of speech. For the English word well, for example, the lookup module
might return the tags
11/15 NN/18 QL/68 RB/634 UH/22 VB/5
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.691668">

does not need to be tagged specifically for this task.

3.2.3 Heuristics for Unknown Words. If a word is not present in the lexicon, the Satz
system contains a set of heuristics that attempt to assign the most reasonable parts of
speech to the word. A summary of these heuristics is listed below.
• Unknown tokens containing a digit (0-9) are assumed to be numbers.
• Any token beginning with a period, exclamation point, or question mark
is assigned a &amp;quot;possible end-of-sentence punctuation&amp;quot; tag. This catches
common sequences like &amp;quot;?!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;... &amp;quot;.
• Common morphological endings are recognized and the appropriate
part(s)-of-speech is assigned to the entire word.
• Words containing a hyphen are assigned a series of tags and frequencies
equally distributed between adjective, common noun, and proper noun.
• Words containing an internal period are assumed to be abbreviations.
• A capitalized word is not always a proper noun, even when it appears

parts of speech returned by the lookup module are thus mapped into the 18 general
categories given in Figure 2, and the frequencies for each category are summed. In
the case of a probabilistic vector described in Section 3.2.1, the 18 category frequencies
for the word are then converted to probabilities by dividing the frequencies for each
by the total frequency for the word. For a binary vector, all categories with a nonzero
frequency count are assigned a value of 1, and all others are assigned a value of
0. In addition to the 18 category frequencies, the descriptor array also contains two
additional flags that indicate if the word begins with a capital letter and if it follows a
punctuation mark, for a total of 20 items in each descriptor array. These last two flags
allow the system to include capitalization information when it is available without
having to require that this information be present.

3.4 Classification by a Learning Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9364861">
The descriptor arrays representing the tokens in the context are used as the input to
a machine learning algorithm. To disambiguate a punctuation mark given a context
of k surrounding words (referred to in this article as k-context), a window of k + 1
tokens and their descriptor arrays is maintained as the input text is read. The first
k/2 and final k/2 tokens of this sequence represent the context in which the middle
token appears. If the middle token is a potential end-of-sentence punctuation mark,
the descriptor arrays for the context tokens are input to the learning algorithm and the
output result indicates whether the punctuation mark serves as a sentence boundary
or not. In learning mode, the descriptor arrays are used to train the parameters of
the learning algorithm. We investigated the effectiveness of two separate algorithms:
(1) back-propagation training of neural networks, and (2) decision tree induction. The
learning algorithms are described in the next two sections, and the results obtained
with the algorithms are presented in Section 4.
3.4.1 Neural Network. Artificial neural networks have been successfully applied for
many years in speech recognition applications (Bourland and Morgan 1994; Lippmann
1989), and more recently in NLP tasks such as word category prediction (Nakamura
et al. 1990) and part-of-speech tagging (Schmid 1994). Neural networks in the context
of machine learning provide a well-tested training algorithm (back-propagation) that
has achieved high success rates in pattern-recognition problems similar to the problem
posed by sentence boundary disambiguation (Hertz, Krogh, and Palmer 1991).

input layer is fully connected to a hidden layer consisting of] hidden units; the hidden
units in turn feed into one output unit that indicates the results of the function. In a
traditional back-propagation network, the input to a node is the sum of the outputs
of the nodes in the previous layer multiplied by the weights between the layers. This
sum is then passed through a &amp;quot;squashing&amp;quot; function to produce a node output between
0 and 1. A commonly-used squashing function—due to its mathematical properties,

i+e-1 k/T
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.979596884615385">
where hi is the node input and T is a constant to adjust the slope of the sigmoid.
In the Satz system we use a sigmoidal squashing function on all hidden nodes and
the single output node of the neural network. The output of the network is thus a single
value between 0 and 1, and represents the strength of the evidence that a punctuation
mark occurring in its context is indeed the end of a sentence. Two adjustable sensitivity
thresholds, to and t1, are used to classify the results of the disambiguation. If the
output is less than to, the punctuation mark is not a sentence boundary; if the output
is greater than or equal to t1, it is a sentence boundary. Outputs which fall between
the thresholds cannot be disambiguated by the network (which may indicate that the
mark is inherently ambiguous) and are marked accordingly, so they can be treated
specially in later processing.13 For example, the sentence alignment algorithm in Gale
and Church (1993) allows a distinction between hard and soft boundaries, where soft
boundaries are movable by the alignment program. In our case, punctuation marks
remaining ambiguous after processing by Satz can be treated as soft boundaries while
unambiguous punctuation marks (as well as paragraph boundaries) can be treated as
hard boundaries, thus allowing the alignment program greater flexibility.
A neural network is trained by presenting it with input data paired with the de-
sired output. For Satz, the input is the context surrounding the punctuation mark to be
disambiguated, and the output is a score indicating how much evidence there is that
the punctuation mark is acting as an end-of-sentence boundary. The nodes are con-
nected via links that have weights assigned to them, and if the network produces an
incorrect score, the weights are adjusted using an algorithm called back-propagation
(Hertz, Krogh, and Palmer 1991) so that the next time the same input is presented
to the network, the output should more closely match the desired score. This train-
ing procedure is often iterated many times in order to allow the weights to adjust
13 When to = th no punctuation mark is left ambiguous.

appropriately, and the same input data is presented multiple times. Each round of
presenting the same input data is called an epoch; of course, it is desirable to require
as few training epochs and as little training data as possible. If one trains the network
too often on the same data, overfitting can occur, meaning that the weights become
too closely aligned with the particular training data that has been presented to the
network, and so may not correspond well to new examples that will come later. For
this reason, training should be accompanied by cross-validation (Bourland and Mor-
gan 1994), a check against a held-out set of data to be sure that the weights are not
too closely tailored to the training text. This will be described in more detail below.
Training data for the neural network consist of two sets of text in which all sen-
tence boundaries have been manually disambiguated. The first text, the training text,
contains 300-600 test cases, where a test case is an ambiguous punctuation mark. The
weights of the neural network are trained on the training text using the standard back-
propagation algorithm (Hertz, Krogh, and Palmer 1991). The second set of texts used
in training is the cross-validation set, whose contents are separate from the training
text and which contains roughly half as many test cases as the training text. Training
of the weights is not performed on this text; the cross-validation text is instead used
to increase the generalization of the training, such that when the total training error
over the cross-validation text reaches a minimum, training is halted.&amp;quot; Testing is then
performed on texts independent of the training and cross-validation texts. We measure
the speed of training by the number of training epochs required to complete training,
where an epoch is a single pass through all the training data. Training times for all
experiments reported in this article were less than one minute and were obtained on
a DEC Alpha 3000 workstation, unless otherwise noted.
In Sections 4.1-4.9 we present results of testing the Satz system with a neural
network, including investigations of the effects of varying network parameters such
as hidden layer size, threshold values, and amount of training data.
3.4.2 Decision Tree. Algorithms for decision tree induction (Quinlan 1986; Bahl et
al. 1989) have been successfully applied to NLP problems such as parsing (Resnik
1993; Magerman 1995) and discourse analysis (Siegel and McKeown 1994; Soderland
and Lehnert 1994). We tested the Satz system using the c4.5 (Quinlan 1993) decision
tree induction program as the learning algorithm and compared the results to those
obtained previously with the neural network. These results are discussed in Section
4.10.
The induction algorithm proceeds by evaluating the information content of a series
of binary attributes and iteratively building a tree from the attribute values, with the
leaves of the decision tree being the values of the goal attributes. At each step in the
learning procedure, the evolving tree is branched on the attribute that divides the data
items with the highest gain in information. Branches are added to the tree until the
decision tree can classify all items in the training set. Overfitting is also possible in
decision tree induction, resulting in a tree that can very accurately classify the training
data but may not be able to accurately classify new examples. To reduce the effects of
overfitting, the c4.5 learning algorithm prunes the tree after the entire decision tree has
been constructed. It recursively examines each subtree to determine whether replacing
it with a leaf or a branch would reduce the number of errors. This pruning produces
a decision tree better able to classify data different from the training data.
14 The training error is the least mean squares error, one-half the sum of the squares of all the errors,
where the error of a particular item is the difference between the desired output and the actual output
of the neural net.

the training set used to train the neural network.

We first tested the Satz system using English texts from the Wall Street Journal portion
of the ACL/DCI collection (Church and Liberman 1991). We constructed a training text
of 573 test cases and a cross-validation text of 258 test cases.&apos; We then constructed
a separate test text consisting of 27,294 test cases, with a lower bound of 75.0%. The
baseline system (UNIX STYLE) achieved an error rate of 8.3% on the sentence bound-
aries in the test set. The lexicon and thus the frequency counts used to calculate the
descriptor arrays were derived from the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982). In
initial experiments we used the extensive lexicon from the PARTS part-of-speech tag-
ger (Church 1988), which contains 30,000 words. We later experimented with a much
smaller lexicon, and these results are discussed in Section 4.4. In Sections 4.1-4.9 we

to learn the training set; the number in the Testing Errors column is the number of

As described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, the best results were obtained with a context size
of 6 tokens and a hidden layer with 2 units. This configuration produced a total of 409
errors out of 27,294 test cases, for an error rate of 1.5%. These errors fall into two major
categories: (i) false positive, i.e., a punctuation mark the method erroneously labeled
as a sentence boundary and (ii) false negative, i.e., an actual sentence boundary that
the method did not label as such. Table 3 contains a summary of these errors.
These errors can be decomposed into the following groups:
(37.6%) false positive at an abbreviation within a title or name, usually
because the word following the period exists in the lexicon with other
parts of speech (Mr. Gray, Col. North, Mr. Major, Dr. Carpenter, Mr. Sharp).
(22.5%) false negative due to an abbreviation at the end of a sentence,
most frequently Inc., Co., Corp., or U.S., which all occur within sentences
as well.
(11.0%) false positive or negative due to a sequence of characters
including a period and quotation marks, as this sequence can occur both
within and at the end of sentences.
(9.2%) false negative resulting from an abbreviation followed by
quotation marks; related to the previous two types.
(9.8%) false positive or false negative resulting from presence of ellipsis
(...), which can occur at the end of or within a sentence.
(9.9%) miscellaneous errors, including extraneous characters (dashes,
asterisks, etc.), ungrammatical sentences, misspellings, and parenthetical
sentences.
The first two items indicate that the system is having difficulty recognizing the
function of abbreviations. We attempted to counter this by dividing the abbreviations
in the lexicon into two distinct categories, title abbreviations such as Mr. and Dr.,
which almost never occur at the end of a sentence, and all other abbreviations. This
new classification, however, significantly increased the training time and eliminated
only 12 of the 409 errors (2.9%).
The third and fourth items demonstrate the difficulty of distinguishing subsen-
tences within a sentence. This problem may be addressed by creating a new classifi-
cation for punctuation marks, the &amp;quot;embedded end-of-sentence,&amp;quot; as suggested in Sec-
tion 1. The fifth class of error may similarly be addressed by creating a new classifica-
tion for ellipses, and then attempting to determine the role of the ellipses independent
of the sentence boundaries.

4.4 Lexicon Size
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999">
The results in Sections 4.1-4.3 depended on a very large lexicon with more than 30,000
words. It is not always possible to obtain or build a large lexicon, so it is important
to understand the impact of a smaller lexicon on the training time and error rate of
the system. We altered the size of the English lexicon used in training and testing
by removing large sections of the original lexicon and obtained the results in Table 4.
These data demonstrate that a larger lexicon provides faster training and a lower error
rate, although the performance with the smaller lexica was still almost as accurate. In
the experiments described in Sections 4.5-4.10, we used a 5,000 word lexicon.
It is important to note, however, that in reducing the size of the lexicon as a whole,
the number of abbreviations remained constant (at 206). Recognizing abbreviations
gives important evidence as to the location of sentence boundaries, and reducing the
number of abbreviations in the lexicon naturally reduces the accuracy of the system.
Most existing boundary disambiguation systems, such as the STYLE program, depend
heavily on abbreviation lists and would be relatively ineffective without information
about abbreviations. However, the robustness of the Satz system allows it to still
produce a relatively high accuracy without relying on extensive abbreviation lists.
To demonstrate this robustness, we removed all abbreviations from the lexicon after
reducing it in size to 5,000 words. The resulting Satz error rate was 4.9%, which was
still significantly better than the STYLE baseline error rate of 8.3%, which was obtained
with a 48 entry abbreviation list.

A major advantage of the Satz approach to sentence boundary recognition is its robust-
ness. In contrast to many existing systems, which depend on brittle parameters such
as capitalization and spacing, Satz is able to adapt to texts that are not well-formed,
such as single-case texts. The two descriptor array flags for capitalization, discussed in
Section 3.3, allow the system to include capitalization information when it is available.
When this information is not available, the system is nevertheless able to adapt and
produce a low error rate. To demonstrate this robustness, we converted the training,
cross-validation, and test texts used in previous testing to a lower-case-only format,

texts, the Satz system was able to correctly disambiguate all but 3.3% of the sentence
boundaries. After converting the texts to an upper-case-only format, with all capital
letters, and retraining the network on the texts in this format, the system was able to

4.6 Results on OCR Texts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984094117647">
A large and ever-increasing source of on-line texts is texts obtained via optical character
recognition (OCR). These texts require very robust processing methods, as they contain
a large number of extraneous and incorrect characters. The robustness results of the
Satz system in the absence of an abbreviation list and capitalization suggest that it
would be well suited for processing OCR texts as well. To test this, we prepared
a small corpus of raw OCR data containing 1,157 punctuation marks. The STYLE
program produced an error rate of 11.7% over the OCR texts; the Satz system, using
a neural network trained on mixed-case WSJ texts, produced an error rate of 4.2%.
In analyzing the sources of the errors produced by Satz over the raw OCR data, it
was clear that many errors came from areas of high noise in the texts, such as the line
in example (6), which contains an extraneous question mark and three periods. These
areas probably represented charts or tables in the source text and would most likely
need to be eliminated anyway, as it is doubtful any text-processing program would
be able to productively process them. We therefore applied a simple filter to the raw
OCR data to locate areas of high noise and remove them from the text. In the resulting
text of 1,115 punctuation marks, the STYLE program had an error rate of 9.6% while
the Satz system improved to 1.9%.

While the low error rate on OCR texts is encouraging, it should not be viewed as
an absolute figure. One problem with OCR texts is that periods in the original text
may be scanned as commas or dropped from the text completely. Our system is unable
to detect these cases. Similarly, the definition of a sentence boundary is not necessarily
absolute, as large parts of texts may be incorrectly or incompletely scanned by the
OCR program. The resulting &amp;quot;sentences&amp;quot; may not correspond to those in the original
text, as can be seen in example (7). Such problems cause a low error rate to have less
significance in OCR texts than in more well-formed texts such as the WSJ corpus.

At the same time, however, items that had been correctly labeled also fell between
the thresholds, and these are shown in the Were Correct column.17 There is thus a
tradeoff: decreasing the error percentage by adjusting the thresholds also decreases
the percentage of cases correctly labeled and increases the percentage of items left
ambiguous.

can probably be accounted for by the fact that the new training data came from a
different part of the corpus, increasing the size of the training and cross-validation

We next compared the Satz system error rate obtained using the neural network with
results using a decision tree. We were able to use some of the previous results, specifi-
cally the optimality of a 6-context and the effectiveness of a smaller lexicon and binary
feature vectors, to obtain a direct comparison with the neural net results. We used the
c4.5 decision tree induction program (Quinlan 1993) and a 5,000 word lexicon to pro-
duce all decision tree results.
4.10.1 Size of Training Set. As we showed in Section 4.9, the size of the training set
used for the neural network affected the overall system error rate. The same was true
with the decision tree induction algorithm, as seen in Figure 4. The lowest error rate
(1.0%) was obtained with a training set of 6,373 items.
4.10.2 Mixed-Case Results. One advantage of decision tree induction is that the al-
gorithm clearly indicates which of the input attributes are most important. While the
6-context descriptor arrays present 120 input attributes to the algorithm, c4.5 induced
a decision tree utilizing only 10 of the attributes, when trained on the same mixed-case
WSJ text used to train the neural network. The 10 attributes for mixed-case English
texts, as seen in the induced decision tree in Figure 5, are (where t — 1 is the token
preceding the punctuation mark, t + 1 is the token following, and so on):

The decision tree created from the small training set of 622 items resulted in an
error rate of 1.6%. This result was slightly higher than the lowest error rate (1.5%)
obtained with the neural network trained with a similar training set and a 5,000 word
lexicon. The lowest error rate obtained using a larger training set to induce the decision
tree (1.0%), however, is better than the lowest error rate (1.1%) for the neural network
trained on a larger set.
4.10.3 Single-Case Results. Running the induction algorithm on upper-case-only and
lower-case-only texts both produced the same decision tree, shown in Figure 6. An
interesting feature of this tree is that it reduced the 120 input attributes to just 4
important ones. Note the similarity of this tree to the algorithm used by the STYLE
program as discussed in Section 2.
Trained on 622 items, this tree produced 527 errors over the 27,294 item test set,
an error rate of 1.9%, for both upper-case-only and lower-case-only texts. This error
rate is lower than the best result for the neural network (3.3%) on single-case texts,
despite the small size of the training set used.

The German lexicon was built from a series of public-domain word lists obtained
from the Consortium for Lexical Research. In the resulting lexicon of 17,000 German
adjectives, verbs, prepositions, articles, and 156 abbreviations, each word was assigned
only the parts of speech for the lists from which it came, with a frequency of 1 for each
part of speech. As the lack of actual frequency data in the lexicon made construction
of a probabilistic descriptor array impossible, we performed all German experiments
using binary vectors. The part-of-speech tags used were identical to those from the
English lexicon, and the descriptor array mapping remained unchanged. This lexicon

5.1.1 Siiddeutsche Zeitung Corpus. The Suddeutsche Zeitung corpus consists of sev-
eral megabytes of on-line texts from the German newspaper.&apos; We constructed a train-
ing text of 520 items from the Siiddeutsche Zeitung corpus, and a cross-validation text
of 268 items. Training was performed in less than five minutes on a Next workstation.19
Testing on a sample of 3,184 separate items from the same corpus resulted in error rates
less than 1.3%, as summarized in Table 8. A direct comparison to the UNIX STYLE
program is not possible for German texts, as the STYLE program is only effective for
English texts. The SZ corpus did have a lower bound of 79.1%, which was similar to
the 75.0% lower bound of the WSJ corpus.
5.1.2 German News Corpus. The German News corpus was constructed from a series
of public-domain German articles distributed internationally by the University of Ulm.
We constructed a training text of 268 potential sentence boundaries from the corpus,
as well as a cross-validation text of 150 potential sentence boundaries, and the training
time was less than one minute in all cases. A separate portion of the corpus was used
for testing the system and contained over 5,037 potential sentence boundaries from
the months July—October 1994, with a &apos;baseline system performance of 96.7%. Results
of testing on the German News corpus are given in Table 8 and show a very low error
rate for both mixed-case and single-case texts. Repeating the testing with a smaller
lexicon containing less than 2,000 words still produced an error rate lower than 1%
with a slightly higher training time.

The French lexicon was compiled from the part-of-speech data obtained by running
the Xerox PARC part-of-speech tagger (Cutting et al. 1991) on a portion of the French
half of the Canadian Hansards corpus. The lexicon consisted of less than 1,000 words
assigned parts of speech by the tagger, including 20 French abbreviations appended to
the 206 English abbreviations available from the lexicon used in obtaining the results
described in Section 4. The part-of-speech tags in the lexicon were different from
those used in the English implementation, so the descriptor array mapping had to
be adjusted accordingly. The development time required to adapt Satz to French was
two days. A training text of 361 potential sentence boundaries was constructed from
the Hansards corpus, and a cross-validation text of 137 potential sentence boundaries,
and the training time was less than one minute in all cases. The results of testing
the system on a separate set of 3,766 potential sentence boundaries (also from the
Hansards corpus) with a baseline algorithm performance of 80.1% are given in Table
9, including a comparison of results with both probabilistic and binary feature inputs.
These data show a very low system error rate on both mixed and single-case texts. In
addition, the decision tree induced from 498 French training items by the c4.5 program
produced a lower error rate (0.4%) in all cases.

6. Improving Performance on the Difficult Cases
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994434782609">
To demonstrate the performance of our system within a large-scale NLP application,
we integrated the Satz system into an existing information extraction system, the Alem-
bic system (Aberdeen et al. 1995) described in Section 2.2. On the same WSJ corpus
used to test Satz in Section 4, the Alembic system alone achieved an error rate of only
0.9% (the best error rate achieved by Satz was 1.0%). A large percentage of the errors
made by the Alembic module fell into the second category described in Section 4.3,
where one of the five abbreviations Co., Corp., Ltd., Inc., or U.S. occurred at the end of
a sentence. We decided to see if Satz could be applied in such a way that it improved
the results on the hard cases on which the hand-written rules were unable to perform
as well as desired.
We trained Satz on 320 of the problematic examples described above, taken from
the WSJ training corpus. The remaining 19,034 items were used as test data. The
Alembic module was used to disambiguate the sentence boundaries in all cases except
when one of the five problematic abbreviations was encountered; in these cases, Satz
(in neural network mode) was used to determine the role of the period following the
abbreviation. The hybrid disambiguation system reduced the total number of sentence
boundary errors by 46% and the error rate for the whole corpus fell from 0.9% to 0.5%.
We trained Satz again, this time using the decision tree learning method, in order
to see what types of rules were acquired for the problematic sentences. The decision
tree shown in Figure 7 is the result; the performance of Satz with this decision tree
was nearly identical to the performance with the neural network. From this tree it
can be seen that context farther away from the punctuation mark is important, and
extensive use is made of part-of-speech information.

The Satz system offers a robust, rapidly trainable alternative to existing systems,
which usually require extensive manual effort and are tailored to a specific text genre
or a particular language. By using part-of-speech frequency data to represent the con-
text in which the punctuation mark appears, the system offers significant savings in
parameter estimation and training time over word-based methods, while at the same

time producing a very low error rate (see Table 10 for a summary of the best results
for each language).
The systems of Riley (1989) and Wasson report what seem to be slightly better
error rates, but these results are not directly comparable since they were evaluated on
other collections. Furthermore, the Wasson system required nine staff months of devel-
opment, and the Riley system required 25 million word tokens for training and storage
of probabilities for all corresponding word types. By comparison, the Satz approach
has the advantages of flexibility for application to new text genres, small training
sets (and thereby fast training times), relatively small storage requirements, and little
manual effort. The training time on a workstation (in our case a DEC Alpha 3000) is
less than one minute, and the system can perform the sentence boundary disambigua-
tion at a rate exceeding 10,000 sentences/minute. Because the system is lightweight, it
can be incorporated into the tokenization stage of many natural language processing
systems without substantial penalty. For example, combining our system with a fast
sentence alignment program such as that of Gale and Church (1993), which performs
alignment at a rate of up to 1,000 sentences/minute, would make it possible to rapidly
and accurately create a bilingual aligned corpus from raw parallel texts. Because the
system is adaptive, it can be focused on especially difficult cases and combined with
existing systems to achieve still better error rates, as shown in Section 6.
The system was designed to be easily portable to new natural languages, assuming
the accessibility of lexical part-of-speech information. The lexicon itself need not be
exhaustive, as shown by the success of adapting Satz to German and French with
limited lexica, and by the experiments in English lexicon size described in Section 4.4.
The heuristics used within the system to classify unknown words can compensate for
inadequacies in the lexicon, and these heuristics can be easily adjusted.
It is interesting that the system performs so well using only estimates of the parts
of speech of the tokens surrounding the punctuation mark, and using very rough
estimates at that. In the future it may be fruitful to apply a technique that uses such
simple information to more complex problems.

<abstract confidence="0.974939916666667">The sentence is a standard textual unit in natural language processing applications. In many languages the punctuation mark that indicates the end-of-sentence boundary is ambiguous; thus the tokenizers of most NLP systems must be equipped with special sentence boundary recognition rules for every new text collection. As an alternative, this article presents an efficient, trainable system for sentence boundary disambiguation. The system, called Satz, makes simple estimates of the parts of speech of the tokens immediately preceding and following each punctuation mark, and uses these estimates as input to a machine learning algorithm that then classifies the punctuation mark. Satz is very fast both in training and sentence analysis, and its combined robustness and accuracy surpass existing techniques. The system needs only a small lexicon and training corpus, and has been shown to transfer quickly and easily from English to other languages, as demonstrated on French and German.</abstract>

There are a few examples of rule-based and heuristic systems for which performance numbers are available, discussed in the remainder of this subsection. The Alembic information extraction system (Aberdeen et al. 1995) contains a very extensive regular-expression-based sentence boundary disambiguation module, created using the lexical scanner generator Flex (Nicol 1993). The boundary disambiguation module is part of a comprehensive preprocess pipeline that utilizes a list of 75 abbreviations and a series of over 100 hand-crafted rules to identify sentence boundaries, as well as titles, date and time expressions, and abbreviations. The sentence boundary module was developed over the course of more than six staff months. On the Wall Street Journal corpus described in Section 4, Alembic achieved an error rate </context>

In Sections 4.1-4.9 we present results of testing the Satz system with a neural network, including investigations of the effects of varying network parameters such as hidden layer size, threshold values, and amount of training data. 3.4.2 Decision Tree. Algorithms for decision tree induction (Quinlan 1986; Bahl et al. 1989) have been successfully applied to NLP problems such as parsing (Resnik 1993; Magerman 1995) and discourse analysis (Siegel and McKeown 1994; Soderland and Lehnert 1994). We tested the Satz system using the c4.5 (Quinlan 1993) decision tree induction program as the learning algorithm and compared the results to those obtained previously with the neural network.

In learning mode, the descriptor arrays are used to train the parameters of the learning algorithm. We investigated the effectiveness of two separate algorithms: (1) back-propagation training of neural networks, and (2) decision tree induction. The learning algorithms are described in the next two sections, and the results obtained with the algorithms are presented in Section 4. 3.4.1 Neural Network. Artificial neural networks have been successfully applied for many years in speech recognition applications (Bourland and Morgan 1994; Lippmann 1989), and more recently in NLP tasks such as word category prediction (Nakamura et al. 1990) and part-of-speech tagging (Schmid 1994). Neural networks in the context of machine learning provide a well-tested training algorithm (back-propagation) that has achieved high success rates in pattern-recognition problems similar to the problem posed by sentence boundary disambiguation (Hertz, Krogh, and Palmer 1991). For Satz, we used a fully-connected feed-forward neural network, as shown in Figure 3. The network accepts k * 20 input values, where k is the size of the context and 20 is th</context>

Each round of presenting the same input data is called an epoch; of course, it is desirable to require as few training epochs and as little training data as possible. If one trains the network too often on the same data, overfitting can occur, meaning that the weights become too closely aligned with the particular training data that has been presented to the network, and so may not correspond well to new examples that will come later. For this reason, training should be accompanied by cross-validation (Bourland and Morgan 1994), a check against a held-out set of data to be sure that the weights are not too closely tailored to the training text. This will be described in more detail below. Training data for the neural network consist of two sets of text in which all sentence boundaries have been manually disambiguated. The first text, the training text, contains 300-600 test cases, where a test case is an ambiguous punctuation mark. The weights of the neural network are trained on the training text using the standard backpropagation algorithm (Hertz, Krogh, and Palmer 1991). The second set of texts used in training i</context>

Both make use of the words in the context found around the punctuation mark. 2.3.1 Regression Trees. Riley (1989) describes an approach that uses regression trees (Breiman et al. 1984) to classify periods according to the following features: • Probability[word preceding &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; occurs at end of sentence] • Probability[word following &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; occurs at beginning of sentence] • Length of word preceding &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; • Length of word after &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; • Case of word preceding &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;: Upper, Lower, Cap, Numbers • Case of word following &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;: Upper, Lower, Cap, Numbers • Punctuation after &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; (if any) • Abbreviation class of words with &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; The method uses information about one word of context on either side of the punctuation mark and thus must record, for every word in the lexicon, the probability that it oc</context>

The baseline algorithm should perform better than the lower bound and should represent a strong effort or a standard method for solving the problem at hand. Although sentence boundary disambiguation is an essential preprocessing step of many natural language processing systems, it is a topic rarely addressed in the literature and there are few public-domain programs for performing the segmentation task. For our studies we compared our system against the results of the UNIX STYLE program (Cherry and Vesterman 1991).3 The STYLE program, which attempts to provide a stylistic profile of writing at the word and sentence level, reports the length and structure for all sentences in a document, thereby indicating the sentence boundaries. STYLE defines a sentence as a string of words ending in one of: period, exclamation point, question mark, or backslash-period (the latter of which can be used by an author to mark an imperative sentence ending). The program handles numbers with embedded decimal points and commas and makes use of an abbreviation list with 48 entries. It also uses the following heuristic: initia</context>

The Satz tokenizer is implemented using the UNIX tool LEX (Lesk and Schmidt 1975) and is modeled on the tokenizer used by the PARTS part-of-speech tagger (Church 1988). The tokens returned by the LEX program can be a sequence of alphabetic characters, a sequence of digits,8 or a sequence of one or more non-alphanumeric characters such as periods or quotation marks. 3.2 Part-of-Speech Lookup The individual tokens are next assigned a series of possible parts of speech, based on a lexicon and simple heuristics described below. 3.2.1 Representing Context.

Introduction Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the availability of on-line text collections, which are useful in many areas of computational linguistics research. One active area of research is the development of algorithms for aligning sentences in parallel corpora. The success of most natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, including multilingual sentence alignment algorithms (Kay and Roscheisen 1993; Gale and Church 1993),1 part-of-speech taggers (Cutting et al. 1991), and parsers, depends on prior knowledge of the location of sentence boundaries. Segmenting a text into sentences is a nontrivial task, however, since in English and many other languages the end-of-sentence punctuation marks are ambiguous.&apos; A period, for example, can denote a decimal point, an abbreviation, the end of a sentence, or even an abbreviation at the end of a sentence. Exclamation points and question marks can occur within quotation marks or parentheses as well as at the end of a sentence. Ellipsis, a series of periods (...), can occur both within sentences and at * 202 Burlington R</context>

The lexicon consisted of less than 1,000 words assigned parts of speech by the tagger, including 20 French abbreviations appended to the 206 English abbreviations available from the lexicon used in obtaining the results described in Section 4. The part-of-speech tags in the lexicon were different from those used in the English implementation, so the descriptor array mapping had to be adjusted accordingly.

Thus, for the task of sentence boundary disambiguation, we define the lower bound of a text collection as the percentage of possible sentence-ending punctuation marks in the text that indeed denote sentence boundaries. Since the use of abbreviations in a text depends on the particular text and text genre, the number of ambiguous punctuation marks, and the corresponding lower bound, will vary dramatically depending on text genre. For example, Liberman and Church (1992) report on a Wall Street Journal corpus containing 14,153 periods per million tokens, whereas in the Tagged Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982), the figure is only 10,910 periods per million tokens. Liberman and Church also report that 47% of the periods in the WSJ corpus denote abbreviations (thus a lower bound of 53%), compared to only 10% in the Brown corpus (lower bound 90%) (Riley 1989). In contrast, Muller, Amerl, and Natalis (1980) reports lower bound statistics ranging from 54.7% to 92.8% within a corpus of scientific abstracts. Such a range of lower bound figures suggests the need for a robust approach that can adapt rapidly to different text requirements. Another useful evaluation technique is the comparison of a new algori</context>

These heuristics can be easily modified and adapted to the specific needs of a new language,12 although we obtained low error rates without changing the heuristics. 3.3 Descriptor Array Construction A vector, or descriptor array, is constructed for each token in the input text. The lexicon may contain as many as several hundred very specific tags, which we first need to map into more general categories. For example, the Brown corpus tags of present tense verb, 10 In this example, the frequencies are derived from the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982). 11 Note that in the case of binary vectors, all probabilities receive the value 1. 12 For example, the probability of a capitalized word being a proper noun is higher in English than in German, where all nouns are also capitalized. 249 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 noun verb article modifier conjunction pronoun preposition proper noun number comma or semicolon left parentheses right parentheses non-punctuation character possessive colon or dash abbreviation sentence-ending punctuation others Figure 2 Elements of the descriptor array assigned to each incoming token. past parti</context>

Introduction Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the availability of on-line text collections, which are useful in many areas of computational linguistics research. One active area of research is the development of algorithms for aligning sentences in parallel corpora. The success of most natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, including multilingual sentence alignment algorithms (Kay and Roscheisen 1993; Gale and Church 1993),1 part-of-speech taggers (Cutting et al. 1991), and parsers, depends on prior knowledge of the location of sentence boundaries. Segmenting a text into sentences is a nontrivial task, however, since in English and many other languages the end-of-sentence punctuation marks are ambiguous.&apos; A period, for example, can denote a decimal point, an abbreviation, the end of a sentence, or even an abbreviation at the end of a sentence. Exclamation points and question marks can occur within quotation marks or parentheses as well as at the end of a sentence. Ellipsis, a series of periods (...), can occur </context>

Two adjustable sensitivity thresholds, to and t1, are used to classify the results of the disambiguation. If the output is less than to, the punctuation mark is not a sentence boundary; if the output is greater than or equal to t1, it is a sentence boundary. Outputs which fall between the thresholds cannot be disambiguated by the network (which may indicate that the mark is inherently ambiguous) and are marked accordingly, so they can be treated specially in later processing.13 For example, the sentence alignment algorithm in Gale and Church (1993) allows a distinction between hard and soft boundaries, where soft boundaries are movable by the alignment program. In our case, punctuation marks remaining ambiguous after processing by Satz can be treated as soft boundaries while unambiguous punctuation marks (as well as paragraph boundaries) can be treated as hard boundaries, thus allowing the alignment program greater flexibility. A neural network is trained by presenting it with input data paired with the desired output. For Satz, the input is the context surrounding the punctuation mark to be disambiguated, and the output is a score indi</context>

The training time on a workstation (in our case a DEC Alpha 3000) is less than one minute, and the system can perform the sentence boundary disambiguation at a rate exceeding 10,000 sentences/minute. Because the system is lightweight, it can be incorporated into the tokenization stage of many natural language processing systems without substantial penalty. For example, combining our system with a fast sentence alignment program such as that of Gale and Church (1993), which performs alignment at a rate of up to 1,000 sentences/minute, would make it possible to rapidly and accurately create a bilingual aligned corpus from raw parallel texts. Because the system is adaptive, it can be focused on especially difficult cases and combined with existing systems to achieve still better error rates, as shown in Section 6. The system was designed to be easily portable to new natural languages, assuming the accessibility of lexical part-of-speech information.

The tokens returned by the LEX program can be a sequence of alphabetic characters, a sequence of digits,8 or a sequence of one or more non-alphanumeric characters such as periods or quotation marks. 3.2 Part-of-Speech Lookup The individual tokens are next assigned a series of possible parts of speech, based on a lexicon and simple heuristics described below. 3.2.1 Representing Context.

Therefore, a very simple, successful algorithm is one in which every potential boundary marker is labeled as the end-of-sentence. Thus, for the task of sentence boundary disambiguation, we define the lower bound of a text collection as the percentage of possible sentence-ending punctuation marks in the text that indeed denote sentence boundaries. Since the use of abbreviations in a text depends on the particular text and text genre, the number of ambiguous punctuation marks, and the corresponding lower bound, will vary dramatically depending on text genre. For example, Liberman and Church (1992) report on a Wall Street Journal corpus containing 14,153 periods per million tokens, whereas in the Tagged Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982), the figure is only 10,910 periods per million tokens. Liberman and Church also report that 47% of the periods in the WSJ corpus denote abbreviations (thus a lower bound of 53%), compared to only 10% in the Brown corpus (lower bound 90%) (Riley 1989). In contrast, Muller, Amerl, and Natalis (1980) reports lower bound statistics ranging from 54.7% to 92.8% within a corpus of scientific abstracts.

The trade-off for this decreased error rate is a longer training time (often more than 10 minutes) as well as the extra time required to construct the larger sets. 4.10 Decision Trees We next compared the Satz system error rate obtained using the neural network with results using a decision tree. We were able to use some of the previous results, specifically the optimality of a 6-context and the effectiveness of a smaller lexicon and binary feature vectors, to obtain a direct comparison with the neural net results. We used the c4.5 decision tree induction program (Quinlan 1993) and a 5,000 word lexicon to produce all decision tree results. 4.10.1 Size of Training Set. As we showed in Section 4.9, the size of the training set used for the neural network affected the overall system error rate. The same was true with the decision tree induction algorithm, as seen in Figure 4. The lowest error rate (1.0%) was obtained with a training set of 6,373 items. 4.10.2 Mixed-Case Results. One advantage of decision tree induction is that the algorithm clearly indicates which of the input attributes are most important.

For example, Liberman and Church (1992) report on a Wall Street Journal corpus containing 14,153 periods per million tokens, whereas in the Tagged Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982), the figure is only 10,910 periods per million tokens. Liberman and Church also report that 47% of the periods in the WSJ corpus denote abbreviations (thus a lower bound of 53%), compared to only 10% in the Brown corpus (lower bound 90%) (Riley 1989). In contrast, Muller, Amerl, and Natalis (1980) reports lower bound statistics ranging from 54.7% to 92.8% within a corpus of scientific abstracts. Such a range of lower bound figures suggests the need for a robust approach that can adapt rapidly to different text requirements. Another useful evaluation technique is the comparison of a new algorithm against a strong baseline algorithm. The baseline algorithm should perform better than the lower bound and should represent a strong effort or a standard method for solving the problem at hand. Although sentence boundary disambiguation is an essen</context>

The morphological analysis makes it possible to identify words not otherwise present in the extensive word lists used to identify abbreviations. Error rates of 2-5% are reported for this method tested on over 75,000 scientific abstracts, with lower bounds ranging from 54.7% to 92.8%. 2.3 Approaches Using Machine Learning There have been two other published attempts to apply machine-learning techniques to the sentence boundary disambiguation task. Both make use of the words in the context found around the punctuation mark. 2.3.1 Regression Trees. Riley (1989) describes an approach that uses regression trees (Breiman et al. 1984) to classify periods according to the following features: • Probability[word preceding &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; occurs at end of sentence] • Probability[word following &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; occurs at beginning of sentence] • Length of word preceding &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; • Length of word after &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; • Case of word preceding &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;: Upper, Lower, Cap, Numbers • Case of word following &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;: Upper, Lower, Cap, Numbers • Punctuation after &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; (if any) • Abbreviation class of words with &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; The method uses information about one word of context on either side of the punctuation mark and thus</context>

By using part-of-speech frequency data to represent the context in which the punctuation mark appears, the system offers significant savings in parameter estimation and training time over word-based methods, while at the same no 264 Palmer and Hearst Multilingual Sentence Boundary time producing a very low error rate (see Table 10 for a summary of the best results for each language). The systems of Riley (1989) and Wasson report what seem to be slightly better error rates, but these results are not directly comparable since they were evaluated on other collections. Furthermore, the Wasson system required nine staff months of development, and the Riley system required 25 million word tokens for training and storage of probabilities for all corresponding word types. By comparison, the Satz approach has the advantages of flexibility for application to new text genres, small training sets (and thereby fast training times), relatively small storage requirements, and little manual effort.

We investigated the effectiveness of two separate algorithms: (1) back-propagation training of neural networks, and (2) decision tree induction. The learning algorithms are described in the next two sections, and the results obtained with the algorithms are presented in Section 4. 3.4.1 Neural Network. Artificial neural networks have been successfully applied for many years in speech recognition applications (Bourland and Morgan 1994; Lippmann 1989), and more recently in NLP tasks such as word category prediction (Nakamura et al. 1990) and part-of-speech tagging (Schmid 1994). Neural networks in the context of machine learning provide a well-tested training algorithm (back-propagation) that has achieved high success rates in pattern-recognition problems similar to the problem posed by sentence boundary disambiguation (Hertz, Krogh, and Palmer 1991). For Satz, we used a fully-connected feed-forward neural network, as shown in Figure 3. The network accepts k * 20 input values, where k is the size of the context and 20 is the number of elements in the descriptor array described in Section 3.3.
