In this paper we explore the utility of the
Navigation Map (NM), a graphical repre-
sentation of the discourse structure. We run
a user study to investigate if users perceive
the NM as helpful in a tutoring spoken dia-
logue system. From the users’ perspective,
our results show that the NM presence al-
lows them to better identify and follow the
tutoring plan and to better integrate the in-
struction. It was also easier for users to
concentrate and to learn from the system if
the NM was present. Our preliminary
analysis on objective metrics further
strengthens these findings.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999843611111111">
With recent advances in spoken dialogue system
technologies, researchers have turned their atten-
tion to more complex domains (e.g. tutoring
(Litman and Silliman, 2004; Pon-Barry et al.,
2006), technical support (Acomb et al., 2007),
medication assistance (Allen et al., 2006)). These
domains bring forward new challenges and issues
that can affect the usability of such systems: in-
creased task complexity, user’s lack of or limited
task knowledge, and longer system turns.
In typical information access dialogue systems,
the task is relatively simple: get the information
from the user and return the query results with
minimal complexity added by confirmation dia-
logues. Moreover, in most cases, users have
knowledge about the task. However, in complex
domains things are different. Take for example
tutoring. A tutoring dialogue system has to discuss

<bodyText confidence="0.999931216216216">
concepts, laws and relationships and to engage in
complex subdialogues to correct user misconcep-
tions. In addition, it is very likely that users of such
systems are not familiar or are only partially famil-
iar with the tutoring topic. The length of system
turns can also be affected as these systems need to
make explicit the connections between parts of the
underlying task.
Thus, interacting with such systems can be char-
acterized by an increased user cognitive load asso-
ciated with listening to often lengthy system turns
and the need to integrate the current information to
the discussion overall (Oviatt et al., 2004).
We hypothesize that one way to reduce the
user’s cognitive load is to make explicit two pieces
of information: the purpose of the current system
turn, and how the system turn relates to the overall
discussion. This information is implicitly encoded
in the intentional structure of a discourse as pro-
posed in the Grosz &amp; Sidner theory of discourse
(Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
Consequently, in this paper we propose using a
graphical representation of the discourse structure
as a way of improving the performance of com-
plex-domain dialogue systems (note that graphical
output is required). We call it the Navigation Map
(NM). The NM is a dynamic representation of the
discourse segment hierarchy and the discourse seg-
ment purpose information enriched with several
features (Section 3). To make a parallel with geog-
raphy, as the system “navigates” with the user
through the domain, the NM offers a cartographic
view of the discussion. While a somewhat similar
graphical representation of the discourse structure
has been explored in one previous study (Rich and
Sidner, 1998), to our knowledge we are the first to
test its benefits (see Section 6).

As a first step towards understanding the NM ef-
fects, here we focus on investigating whether users
prefer a system with the NM over a system without
the NM and, if yes, what are the NM usage pat-
terns. We test this in a speech based computer tutor
(Section 2). We run a within-subjects user study in
which users interacted with the system both with
and without the NM (Section 4).
Our analysis of the users’ subjective evaluation
of the system indicates that users prefer the version
of the system with the NM over the version with-
out the NM on several dimensions. The NM pres-
ence allows the users to better identify and follow
the tutoring plan and to better integrate the instruc-
tion. It was also easier for users to concentrate and
to learn from the system if the NM was present.
Our preliminary analysis on objective metrics fur-
ther strengthens these findings.

2 ITSPOKE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999265">
ITSPOKE (Litman and Silliman, 2004) is a state-
of-the-art tutoring spoken dialogue system for con-
ceptual physics. When interacting with ITSPOKE,
users first type an essay answering a qualitative
physics problem using a graphical user interface.
ITSPOKE then engages the user in spoken dialogue
(using head-mounted microphone input and speech
output) to correct misconceptions and elicit more
complete explanations, after which the user revises
the essay, thereby ending the tutoring or causing
another round of tutoring/essay revision.
All dialogues with ITSPOKE follow a question-
answer format (i.e. system initiative): ITSPOKE
asks a question, users answer and then the process
is repeated. Deciding what question to ask, in what
order and when to stop is hand-authored before-
hand in a hierarchical structure. Internally, system
questions are grouped in question segments.
In Figure 1, we show the transcript of a sample
interaction with ITSPOKE. The system is discussing
the problem listed in the upper right corner of the
figure and it is currently asking the question Tu-
tor5. The left side of the figure shows the interac-
tion transcript (not available to the user at run-
time). The right side of the figure shows the NM
which will be discussed in the next section.
Our system behaves as follows. First, based on
the analysis of the user essay, it selects a question
segment to correct misconceptions or to elicit more
complete explanations. Next the system asks every
question from this question segment. If the user
answer is correct, the system simply moves on to
the next question (e.g. Tutor2→Tutor3). For incor-
rect answers there are two alternatives. For simple
questions, the system will give out the correct an-
swer accompanied by a short explanation and
move on to the next question (e.g. Tutor1→Tutor2).
For complex questions (e.g. applying physics
laws), ITSPOKE will engage into a remediation
subdialogue that attempts to remediate user’s lack
of knowledge or skills (e.g. Tutor4→Tutor5). The
remediation subdialogue for each complex ques-
tion is specified in another question segment.
Our system exhibits some of the issues we
linked in Section 1 with complex-domain systems.
Dialogues with our system can be long and com-
plex (e.g. the question segment hierarchical struc-
ture can reach level 6) and sometimes the system’s
turn can be quite long (e.g. Tutor2). User’s reduced
knowledge of the task is also inherent in tutoring.

We use the Grosz &amp; Sidner theory of discourse
(Grosz and Sidner, 1986) to inform our NM de-
sign. According to this theory, each discourse has a
discourse purpose/intention. Satisfying the main
discourse purpose is achieved by satisfying several
smaller purposes/intentions organized in a hierar-
chical structure. As a result, the discourse is seg-
mented into discourse segments each with an asso-
ciated discourse segment purpose/intention. This
theory has inspired several generic dialogue man-
agers for spoken dialogue systems (e.g. (Rich and
Sidner, 1998)).
The NM requires that we have the discourse
structure information at runtime. To do that, we
manually annotate the system’s internal representa-
tion of the tutoring task with discourse segment
purpose and hierarchy information. Based on this
annotation, we can easily construct the discourse
structure at runtime. In this section we describe our
annotation and the NM design choices we made.
Figure 1 shows the state of the NM after turn Tu-
tor5 as the user sees it on the interface (NM line
numbering is for exposition only). Note that Figure
1 is not a screenshot of the actual system interface.
The NM is the only part from the actual system
interface. Figure 2 shows the NM after turn Tutor1.
We manually annotated each system ques-
tion/explanation for its intention(s)/purpose(s).

TUTOR1: To analyze this problem we will first de-
scribe the motion of the person and his keys while he
is holding them. Then we will look at the motion of
the person and his keys after he lets go of them.
Let&apos;s begin by looking at the motion of the man and
his keys while he is holding them.
How does his velocity compare to that of his keys?
User answer1: man’s velocity is bigger [incorrect]
TUTOR2: Well... The problem statement says that the
man is holding his keys motionless in front of his
face. That means they are both falling together and
are not moving with respect to each other. Hence their
velocities are the same.
Now let&apos;s see what happens when he releases them.
To do so we will first find the individual forces
exerted on the man and his keys, then both net forces,
both accelerations, and finally we will describe and
compare the velocities.
So what are the forces exerted on the man after he
releases his keys? Please, specify their directions.
User answer2: gravity vertically down [correct]
TUTOR3: Good. Because there is just one force, grav-
ity&apos;s, it is trivial to determine the NET force. So what
is the direction of the NET force on the person?

tion we will use Newton&apos;s second law. What is
the definition of this law?
Problem: Suppose a man is in a free-falling elevator and is
holding his keys motionless right in front of his face. He then
lets go. What will be the position of the keys relative to the

tions/purposes thus multiple discourse segments
were created for them. For example, in Tutor1 the
system first identifies the time frames on which the
analysis will be performed (Figure 1&amp;2, NM2).
Next, the system indicates that it will discuss about
the first time frame (Figure 1&amp;2, NM3) and then it
asks the actual question (Figure 2, NM4).
Thus, in addition to our manual annotation of
the discourse segment purpose information, we
manually organized all discourse segments from a
question segment in a hierarchical structure that
reflects the discourse structure.
At runtime, while discussing a question seg-
ment, the system has only to follow the annotated
hierarchy, displaying and highlighting the dis-
course segment purposes associated with the ut-
tered content. For example, while uttering Tutor1,
the NM will synchronously highlight NM2, NM3
and NM4. Remediation question segments (e.g.
NM12) or explanations (e.g. NM5) activated by in-
correct answers are attached to the structure under
the corresponding discourse segment.

Correct answers. In Figure 2 we show the state
of the NM after uttering Tutor1. The current dis-
course segment purpose (NM4) indicates that the
system is asking about the relationship between the
two velocities. While we could have kept the same
information after the system was done with this
discourse segment, we thought that users will
benefit from having the correct answer on the
screen (recall NM4 in Figure 1). Thus, the NM was
enhanced to display the correct answer after the
system is done with each question. We extracted
the correct answer from the system specifications
for each question and manually created a new ver-
sion of the discourse segment purpose that includes
this information.

Limited horizon. Since in our case the system
drives the conversation (i.e. system initiative), we
always know what questions would be discussed
next. We hypothesized that by having access to
this information, users will have a better idea of
where instruction is heading, thus facilitating their
understanding of the relevance of the current topic
to the overall discussion. To prevent information
overload, we only display the next discourse seg-
ment purpose at each level in the hierarchy (see
Figure 1, NM14, NM16, NM17 and NM19; Figure 2,
NM5); additional discourse segments at the same
level are signaled through a dotted line. To avoid
helping the students answer the current question in
cases when the next discourse segment hints/de-
scribes the answer, each discourse segment has an
additional purpose annotation that is displayed
when the segment is part of the visible horizon.
Auto-collapse. To reduce the amount of infor-
mation on the screen, discourse segments dis-
cussed in the past are automatically collapsed by
the system. For example, in Figure 1, NM Line 3 is
collapsed in the actual system and Lines 4 and 5
are hidden (shown in Figure1 to illustrate our dis-
course structure annotation.). The user can expand
nodes as desired using the mouse.
Information highlight. Bold and italics font
were used to highlight important information (what
and when to highlight was manually annotated).
For example, in Figure 1, NM2 highlights the two
time frames as they are key steps in approaching
this problem. Correct answers are also highlighted.
We would like to reiterate that the goal of this
study is to investigate if making certain types of
discourse information explicitly available to the
user provides any benefits. Thus, whether we have
made the optimal design choices is of secondary
importance. While, we believe that our annotation
is relatively robust as the system questions follow a
carefully designed tutoring plan, in the future we
would like to investigate these issues.

4 User Study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999807245283019">
We designed a user study focused primarily on
user’s perception of the NM presence/absence. We
used a within-subject design where each user re-
ceived instruction both with and without the NM.
Each user went through the same experimental
procedure: 1) read a short document of background
material, 2) took a pretest to measure initial phys-
ics knowledge, 3) worked through 2 problems with
ITSPOKE 4) took a posttest similar to the pretest, 5)
took a NM survey, and 6) went through a brief
open-question interview with the experimenter.
In the 3rd step, the NM was enabled in only one
problem. Note that in both problems, users did not
have access to the system turn transcript. After
each problem users filled in a system question-
naire in which they rated the system on various
dimensions; these ratings were designed to cover
dimensions the NM might affect (see Section 5.1).
While the system questionnaire implicitly probed
the NM utility, the NM survey from the 5th step
explicitly asked the users whether the NM was use-
ful and on what dimensions (see Section 5.1)
To account for the effect of the tutored problem
on the user’s questionnaire ratings, users were ran-
domly assigned to one of two conditions. The users
in the first condition (F) had the NM enabled in the
first problem and disabled in the second problem,
while users in the second condition (S) had the op-
posite. Thus, if the NM has any effect on the user’s
perception of the system, we should see a decrease
in the questionnaire ratings from problem 1 to
problem 2 for F users and an increase for S users.
Other factors can also influence our measure-
ments. To reduce the effect of the text-to-speech
component, we used a version of the system with
human prerecorded prompts. We also had to ac-
count for the amount of instruction as in our sys-
tem the top level question segment is tailored to
what users write in the essay. Thus the essay
analysis component was disabled; for all users, the
system started with the same top level question
segment which assumed no information in the es-
say. Note that the actual dialogue depends on the
correctness of the user answers. After the dialogue,
users were asked to revise their essay and then the
system moved on to the next problem.
The collected corpus comes from 28 users (13 in
F and 15 in S). The conditions were balanced for
gender (F: 6 male, 7 female; S: 8 male, 7 female).
There was no significant differences between the
two conditions in terms of pretest (p&lt;0.63); in both
conditions users learned (significant difference
between pretest and posttest, p&lt;0.01).

each problem. These questionnaires are identical
and include 16 questions that probed user’s percep-
tion of ITSPOKE on various dimensions. Users
were asked to answer the questions on a scale from
1-5 (1 – Strongly Disagree, 2 – Disagree, 3 –
Somewhat Agree, 4 – Agree, 5 – Strongly Agree).
If indeed the NM has any effect we should observe
differences between the ratings of the NM problem
and the noNM problem (i.e. the NM is disabled).
Table 1 lists the 16 questions in the question-
naire order. The table shows for every question the
average rating for all condition-problem combina-
tions (e.g. column 5: condition F problem 1 with
the NM enabled). For all questions except Q7 and
Q11 a higher rating is better. For Q7 and Q11
(italicized in Table 1) a lower rating is better as
they gauge negative factors (high level of concen-
tration and task disorientation). They also served as
a deterrent for negligence while rating.
To test if the NM presence has a significant ef-
fect, a repeated-measure ANOVA with between-
subjects factors was applied. The within-subjects
factor was the NM presence (NMPres) and the
between-subjects factor was the condition (Cond)1.
The significance of the effect of each factor and
their combination (NMPres*Cond) is listed in the
table with significant and trend effects highlighted
in bold (see columns 2-4). Post-hoc t-tests between
the NM and noNM ratings were run for each con-
dition (“s”/“t”marks significant/trend differences).

Questions Q1-6 were inspired by previous work
on spoken dialogue system evaluation (e.g.
(Walker et al., 2000)) and measure user’s overall
perception of the system. We find that the NM
presence significantly improves user’s perception
of the system in terms of their ability to concen-
trate on the instruction (Q3), in terms of their incli-
nation to reuse the system (Q6) and in terms of the
system’s matching of their expectations (Q4).
There is a trend that it was easier for them to learn
from the NM enabled version of the system (Q2).

formation. These questions probe the user’s per-
ception of ITSPOKE during the dialogue. We find
that for 6 out 7 questions the NM presence has a
significant/trend effect (Table 1, column 2).
Structure. Users perceive the system as having
a structured tutoring plan significantly2 more in the
NM problems (Q8). Moreover, it is significantly
easier for them to follow this tutoring plan if the
NM is present (Q11). These effects are very clear
for F users where their ratings differ significantly
between the first (NM) and the second problem
(noNM). A difference in ratings is present for S
users but it is not significant. As with most of the S
users’ ratings, we believe that the NM presentation
order is responsible for the mostly non-significant
differences. More specifically, assuming that the
NM has a positive effect, the S users are asked to
rate first the poorer version of the system (noNM)
and then the better version (NM). In contrast, F
users’ task is easier as they already have a high
reference point (NM) and it is easier for them to
criticize the second problem (noNM). Other factors
that can blur the effect of the NM are domain
learning and user’s adaptation to the system.
Integration. Q9 and Q10 look at how well users
think they integrate the system questions in both a
forward-looking fashion (Q9) and a backward
looking fashion (Q10). Users think that it is sig-
nificantly easier for them to integrate the current
system question to what will be discussed in the
future if the NM is present (Q9). Also, if the NM is
present, it is easier for users to integrate the current
question to the discussion so far (Q10, trend). For
Q10, there is no difference for F users but a sig-
nificant one for S users. We hypothesize that do-
main learning is involved here: F users learn better
from the first problem (NM) and thus have less
issues solving the second problem (noNM). In con-
trast, S users have more difficulties in the first
problem (noNM), but the presence of the NM
eases their task in the second problem.
Correctness. The correct answer NM feature is
useful for users too. There is a trend that it is easier
for users to know the correct answer if the NM is
present (Q13). We hypothesize that speech recog-
nition and language understanding errors are re-

ing the discourse segment purpose as visual input
allows the users to concentrate more easily on what
the system is uttering. In many of the open ques-
tion interviews users stated that it was easier for
them to listen to the system when they had the dis-
course segment purpose displayed on the screen.

Results for Q14-16

<bodyText confidence="0.991371545454545">
Questions Q14-16 were included to probe user’s
post tutoring perceptions. We find a trend that in
the NM problems it was easier for users to under-
stand the system’s main point (Q14). However, in
terms of identifying (Q15) and correcting (Q16)
problems in their essay the results are inconclusive.
We believe that this is due to the fact that the essay
interpretation component was disabled in this ex-
periment. As a result, the instruction did not match
the initial essay quality. Nonetheless, in the open-
question interviews, many users indicated using
the NM as a reference while updating their essay.
In addition to the 16 questions, in the system
questionnaire after the second problem users were
asked to choose which version of the system they
preferred the most (i.e. the first or the second prob-
lem version). 24 out 28 users (86%) preferred the
NM enabled version. In the open-question inter-
view, the 4 users that preferred the noNM version
(2 in each condition) indicated that it was harder
for them to concurrently concentrate on the audio
and the visual input (divided attention problem)
and/or that the NM was changing too fast.
To further strengthen our conclusions from the
system questionnaire analysis, we would like to
note that users were not asked to directly compare
the two versions but they were asked to individu-
ally rate two versions which is a noisier process
(e.g. users need to recall their previous ratings).
The NM survey
While the system questionnaires probed users’
NM usage indirectly, in the second to last step in
the experiments, users had to fill a NM survey

which explicitly asked how the NM helped them, if
at all. The answers were on the same 1 to 5 scale.
We find that the majority of users (75%-86%)
agreed or strongly agreed that the NM helped them
follow the dialogue, learn more easily, concentrate
and update the essay. These findings are on par
with those from the system questionnaire analysis.

5.2 Objective metrics

Our analysis of the subjective user evaluations
shows that users think that the NM is helpful. We
would like to see if this perceived usefulness is
reflected in any objective metrics of performance.
Due to how our experiment was designed, the ef-
fect of the NM can be reliably measured only in
the first problem as in the second problem the NM
is toggled3; for the same reason, we can not use the
pretest/posttest information.
Our preliminary investigation 4 found several
dimensions on which the two conditions differed in
the first problem (F users had NM, S users did
not). We find that if the NM was present the inter-
action was shorter on average and users gave more
correct answers; however these differences are not
statistically significant (Table 2). In terms of
speech recognition performance, we looked at two
metrics: AsrMis and SemMis (ASR/Semantic Mis-
recognition). A user turn is labeled as AsrMis if the
output of the speech recognition is different from
the human transcript (i.e. a binary version of Word
Error Rate). SemMis are AsrMis that change the
correctness interpretation. We find that if the NM
was present users had fewer AsrMis and fewer
SemMis (trend for SemMis, p&lt;0.09).
In addition, a χ2 dependency analysis showed
that the NM presence interacts significantly with
both AsrMis (p&lt;0.02) and SemMis (p&lt;0.001), with
fewer than expected AsrMis and SemMis in the
3 Due to random assignment to conditions, before the
first problem the F and S populations are similar (e.g. no
difference in pretest); thus any differences in metrics
can be attributed to the NM presence/absence. However,
in the second problem, the two populations are not simi-
lar anymore as they have received different forms of
instruction; thus any difference has to be attributed to
the NM presence/absence in this problem as well as to
the NM absence/presence in the previous problem.

analysis (13 F and 13 S users remaining). We run the

set and the results are similar.
NM condition. The fact that in the second problem
the differences are much smaller (e.g. 2% for
AsrMis) and that the NM-AsrMis and NM-
SemMis interactions are not significant anymore,
suggests that our observations can not be attributed
to a difference in population with respect to sys-
tem’s ability to recognize their speech. We hy-
pothesize that these differences are due to the NM
text influencing users’ lexical choice.

Discourse structure has been successfully used in
non-interactive settings (e.g. understanding spe-
cific lexical and prosodic phenomena (Hirschberg
and Nakatani, 1996) , natural language generation
(Hovy, 1993), essay scoring (Higgins et al., 2004)
as well as in interactive settings (e.g. predic-
tive/generative models of postural shifts (Cassell et
al., 2001), generation/interpretation of anaphoric
expressions (Allen et al., 2001), performance mod-
eling (Rotaru and Litman, 2006)).
In this paper, we study the utility of the dis-
course structure on the user side of a dialogue sys-
tem. One related study is that of (Rich and Sidner,
1998). Similar to the NM, they use the discourse
structure information to display a segmented inter-
action history (SIH): an indented view of the inter-
action augmented with purpose information. This
paper extends over their work in several areas. The
most salient difference is that here we investigate
the benefits of displaying the discourse structure
information for the users. In contrast, (Rich and
Sidner, 1998) never test the utility of the SIH.
Their system uses a GUI-based interaction (no
speech/text input, no speech output) while we look
at a speech-based system. Also, their underlying
task (air travel domain) is much simpler than our
tutoring task. In addition, the SIH is not always
available and users have to activate it manually.
Other visual improvements for dialogue-based
computer tutors have been explored in the past
(e.g. talking heads (Graesser et al., 2003)). How-
ever, implementing the NM in a new domain re-
quires little expertise as previous work has shown
