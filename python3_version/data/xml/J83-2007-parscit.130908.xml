International Conference on Fifth Generation
Computer Systems, 1984: Call for Papers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995818111111111">
The scope of technical sessions of this conference
encompasses the technical aspects of new generation
computer systems which are being explored particular-
ly within the framework of logic programming and
novel architectures. This conference is intended to
promote interaction among researchers in all disci-
plines related to fifth generation computer technology.
The topics of interest include (but are not limited to)
the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99971">
• Foundations for Logic Programs
• Logic Programming Languages/Methodologies
• Architectures for New Generation Computing

Workshop on Non-monotonic Reasoning: Call
for Participation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992568">
The American Association for Artificial Intelligence
(AAAI) will sponsor a Workshop on Non-monotonic
Reasoning at the Mohonk Mountain House, New
Paltz, New York, 17-19 October 1984.
Broadly conceived, non-monotonic reasoning is the
process of making and reasoning with plausible or
default assumptions. In recent years its central role
within Artificial Intelligence has become apparent, and
considerable research activity has been directed to-
wards both theoretical and practical issues. The work-
shop aims to assemble theoreticians and practitioners
from across Al who recognize in their research a need
for non-monotonic reasoning. The objective is to
identify those forms of plausible reasoning that arise in
different areas of Al, to isolate common patterns, to
entertain various accounts — both formal and informal
— of these reasoning patterns, and to evaluate their
suitability and limitations.
To encourage interaction and a broad exchange of
ideas, the workshop will be kept small — about 35
participants. Sessions will consist of individual presen-
tations, with ample time for general discussion.
Papers are invited for consideration in all aspects
of non-monotonic reasoning including, but not restrict-
ed to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995804416666667">
• Formal Theory
• Computational Mechanisms
• Philosophical Considerations
• Reason (or &amp;quot;Truth&amp;quot;) Maintenance and the Retrac-
tion of Assumptions
• Non-monotonic Reasoning as It Arises in
— Planning
— Natural Language
— Knowledge Representation
— Data Bases
— Computational Vision
— Expert Systems
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999728285714286">
Three copies of an extended abstract (up to 8
pages, double spaced) should be sent to the General
Chairman, postmarked before 1 May 1984. Accept-
ance notices will be mailed by 15 June 1984. Revised
abstracts should be returned to the General Chairman
by 1 September 1984 so they may be bound for distri-
bution at the workshop.

A Tutorial on Machine Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999302294117647">
will be held by the Institut Dalle Molle pour les Etudes
Semantiques et Cognitives de l&apos;Universite de Geneve
(&amp;quot;ISSCO&amp;quot;) from Monday, 2 April, to Saturday, 7 April,
1984, in Lugano, Switzerland.
The aim of the tutorial is to convey the state of the
art by allowing experts in different aspects of MT to
present their particular point of view. Sessions cover-
ing the historical development of MT and its possible
future evolution will also be included to provide a
tutorial that should be relevant to all concerned with
the relationship between natural language and comput-
er science.
The Tutorial will take place in the Palazzo dei Con-
gressi or the Villa Heleneum, both set in parkland on
the shore of Lake Lugano. Participants will be accom-
modated in nearby hotels. Registration will take place
on the Sunday evening preceding the Tutorial.
