Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99701">
FrameNet is a three-year NSF-supported
project in corpus-based computational lexicog-
raphy, now in its second year (NSF IRI-9618838,
&amp;quot;Tools for Lexicon Building&amp;quot;). The project&apos;s
key features are (a) a commitment to corpus
evidence for semantic and syntactic generaliza-
tions, and (b) the representation of the valences
of its target words (mostly nouns, adjectives,
and verbs) in which the semantic portion makes
use of frame semantics. The resulting database
will contain (a) descriptions of the semantic
frames underlying the meanings of the words de-
scribed, and (b) the valence representation (se-
mantic and syntactic) of several thousand words
and phrases, each accompanied by (c) a repre-
sentative collection of annotated corpus attes-
tations, which jointly exemplify the observed
linkings between &amp;quot;frame elements&amp;quot; and their
syntactic realizations (e.g. grammatical func-
tion, phrase type, and other syntactic traits).
This report will present the project&apos;s goals and
workflow, and information about the computa-
tional tools that have been adapted or created
in-house for this work.

The Berkeley FrameNet project&apos; is producing
frame-semantic descriptions of several thousand
English lexical items and backing up these de-
scriptions with semantically annotated attesta-
tions from contemporary English corpora2.

These descriptions are based on hand-tagged
semantic annotations of example sentences ex-
tracted from large text corpora and systematic
analysis of the semantic patterns they exem-
plify by lexicographers and linguists. The pri-
mary emphasis of the project therefore is the
encoding, by humans, of semantic knowledge
in machine-readable form. The intuition of the
lexicographers is guided by and constrained by
the results of corpus-based research using high-
performance software tools.
The semantic domains to be covered are:
HEALTH CARE, CHANCE, PERCEPTION, COMMU-
NICATION, TRANSACTION, TIME, SPACE, BODY
(parts and functions of the body), MOTION, LIFE
STAGES, SOCIAL CONTEXT, EMOTION and COG-
NITION.

1.1 Scope of the Project
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.7829788">
The results of the project are (a) a lexical re-
source, called the FrameNet database3, and (b)
associated software tools. The database has
three major components (described in more de-
tail below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987884428571429">
• Lexicon containing entries which are com-
posed of: (a) some conventional dictionary-type
data, mainly for the sake of human readers; (b) FOR-
MULAS which capture the morphosyntactic ways in
which elements of the semantic frame can be realized
within the phrases or sentences built up around the
word; (c) links to semantically ANNOTATED EXAM-

European collaborators whose participation has made
this possible are Sue Atkins, Oxford University Press,
and Ulrich Heid, IMS-Stuttgart.
3The database will ultimately contain at least 5,000
lexical entries together with a parallel annotated cor-
pus, these in formats suitable for integration into appli-
cations which use other lexical resources such as Word-
Net and COMLEX. The final design of the database will
be selected in consultation with colleagues at Princeton
(WordNet), ICSI, and IMS, and with other members of
the NLP community.

syntactic properties of the lexical items. (Several
of these are schematized in Fig. 2). These sentences
provide empirical support for the lexicographic anal-
ysis provided in the frame database and lexicon en-
tries.
These three components form a highly rela-
tional and tightly integrated whole: elements
in each may point to elements in the other
two. The database will also contain estimates
of the relative frequency of senses and comple-
mentation patterns calculated by matching the
senses and patterns in the hand-tagged exam-
ples against the entire BNC corpus.

1.2 Conceptual Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993324909090909">
The FrameNet work is in some ways similar
to efforts to describe the argument structures
of lexical items in terms of case-roles or theta-
roles,5 but in FrameNet, the role names (called
frame elements or FEs) are local to particular
conceptual structures (frames); some of these
are quite general, while others are specific to a
small family of lexical items.
For example, the TRANSPORTATION frame,
within the domain of MOTION, provides
MOVERS, MEANS of transportation, and PATHS;6
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.580654">
4In cases of accidental gaps, clearly marked invented
examples may be added.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94775115">
6The semantic frames for individual lexical units are
typically &amp;quot;blends&amp;quot; of more than one basic frame; from
our point of view, the so-called &amp;quot;linking&amp;quot; patterns pro-
posed in LFG, HPSG, and Construction Grammar, op-
erate on higher-level frames of action (giving agent, pa-
tient, instrument), motion and location (giving theme,
location, source, goal, path), and experience (giving ex-
periencer, stimulus, content), etc. In some but not all
cases, the assignment of syntactic correlates to frame el-
ements could be mediated by mapping them to the roles
of one of the more abstract frames.
6A detailed study of motion predicates would require
a finer-grained analysis of the Path element, separating
out Source and Goal, and perhaps Direction and Area,
but for a basic study of the transportation predicates
such refined analysis is not necessary. In any case, our
subframes associated with individual words in-
herit all of these while possibly adding some of
their own. Fig. 1 shows some of the subframes,
as discussed below.

The DRIVING frame, for example, specifies a
DRIVER (a principal MOVER), a VEHICLE (a par-
ticularization of the MEANS element), and po-
tentially CARGO or RIDER as secondary movers.
In this frame, the DRIVER initiates and controls
the movement of the VEHICLE. For most verbs
in this frame, DRIVER or VEHICLE can be real-
ized as subjects; VEHICLE, RIDER, or CARGO can
appear as direct objects; and PATH and VEHICLE
can appear as oblique complements.
Some combinations of frame elements, or
Frame Element Groups (FEGs), for some
real corpus sentences in the DRIVING frame are
shown in Fig. 2.
A RIDING_1 frame has the primary mover role
as RIDER, and allows as VEHICLE those driven
by others.7 In grammatical realizations of this
frame, the RIDER can be the subject; the VEHI-
CLE can appear as a direct object or an oblique
complement; and the PATH is generally realized
as an oblique.
The FrameNet entry for each of these verbs
will include a concise formula for all seman-
work includes the separate analysis of the frame seman-
tics of directional and locational expressions.

tic and syntactic combinatorial possibilities, to-
gether with a collection of annotated corpus sen-
tences in which each possibility is exemplified.
The syntactic positions considered relevant for
lexicographic description include those that are
internal to the maximal projection of the target
word (the whole VP, AP, or NP for target V, A
or N), and those that are external to the max-
imal projection under precise structural condi-
tions; the subject, in the case of VP, and the
subject of support verbs in the case of AP and
NP. 8
Used in NLP, the FrameNet database should
make it possible for a system which finds a
valence-bearing lexical item in a text to know
(for each of its senses) where its individual argu-
ments are likely to be found. For example, once
a parser has found the verb drive and its direct
object NP, the link to the DRIVING frame will
suggest some semantics for that NP, e.g. that
a person as direct object probably represents
the RIDER, while a non-human proper noun is
probably the VEHICLE.
For practical lexicography, the contribution of
the FrameNet database will be its presentation

2.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999667346153846">
The computational side of the FrameNet project
is directed at efficiently capturing human in-
sights into semantic structure. The majority
of the work involved is marking text with se-
mantic tags, specifying (again by hand) the
structure of the frames to be treated, and writ-
ing dictionary-style entries based the results of
annotation and a priori descriptions. With
the exception of the example sentence extrac-
tion component, all the software modules are
highly interactive and have substantial user in-
terface requirements. Most of this functionality
is provided by WWW-based programs written
in PERL.
Four processing steps are required produce
the FrameNet database of frame semantic rep-
resentations: (a) generating initial descriptions
of semantic and syntactic patterns for use in
corpus queries and annotation (&amp;quot;Preparation&amp;quot;),
(b) extracting good example sentences (&amp;quot;Sub-
corpus Extraction&amp;quot;), (c) marking (by hand) the
constituents of interest (&amp;quot;Annotation&amp;quot;), and (d)
building a database of lexical semantic represen-
tations based on the annotations and other data
(&amp;quot;Entry Writing&amp;quot;). These are discussed briefly
below and shown in Fig. 3.

As work on the project has progressed, we
have defined several explicit roles which project
participants play in the various steps. these
roles are referred to as Vanguard (1.1 in

also selects the major vocabulary items for the
frame (the target words) and the syntactic pat-
terns that need to be checked for each word,
which are entered in the Lexical Database (5.2)
by means of the Lexical Database Tool (1.3).
2. Subcorpus Extraction. Based on
the Vanguard&apos;s work, the subcorpus extraction
tools (2.2) produce a representative collection of
sentences containing these words.
This selection of examples is achieved through
a hybrid process partially controlled by the pre-
liminary lexical description of each lemma. Sen-
tences containing the lemma are extracted from
from a corpus and classified into subcorpora
by syntactic pattern (2.2.1) using a CASCADE
FILTER (2.2.2, 2.2.5, 2.2.6) representing a par-
tial regular-expression grammar of English over
part-of-speech tags (cf. Gahl (forthcoming)),
formatted for annotation (2.2.4) , and automat-
ically sampled (2.2.3) down to an appropriate
number.
(If these heuristics fail to find appropriate
examples by means of syntactic patterns, sen-
tences are selected using INTERACTIVE SELEC-

TION TOOLS (2.3)).
3. Annotation. Using the annotation soft-
ware (3.2) and the tagsets (3.2.1) derived from
the Frame Database, the Annotators (3.1) mark
selected constituents in the extracted subcor-
pora according to the frame elements which
they realize, and identify canonical examples,
novel patterns, and problem sentences.10

reviews the skeletal lexical record created by
the Vanguard, the annotated example sentences
(5.3), and the FEGs extracted from them, and
builds both the entries for the lemmas in the
Lexical Database (5.2) and the frame descrip-
tions in the Frame Database (5.1), using the
Entry Writing Tools (4.2).
&apos;°We are building a &amp;quot;constituent type identifier&amp;quot; which
will semi-automatically assign Grammatical Function
(GF), and Phrase Type (PT) attributes to these FE-
marked constituents, eliminating the need for Annota-
tors to mark these.

for our purposes. Nevertheless, using these
programs allowed us to get the project up and
running within just a few months. We describe
below in approximate order of application the
programs used and their state of completion.

• Lexical Description Tool (1.3) (prototype) An

using a preprocessor (written in PERL, 2.2.2) which
generates CQP&apos;s native query language.
• XKWIC (2.3) is an X-window, interactive tool,

combines subcorpora in a preselected order, remov-

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962842105263">
At the time of writing, there is something in
place for each of the major software compo-
nents, though in some cases these are little more
than stubs or &amp;quot;toy&amp;quot; implementations. Nearly
10,000 sentences exemplifying just under 200
lemmas have been annotated; there are over
20,000 frame element tokens marked in these
example sentences. About a dozen frames have
been specified, which refer to 47 named frame
elements. Most of these annotations have been
accomplished in the last few months since the
software for corpus extraction, frame descrip-
tion, and annotation became operational. We
expect the inventory to increase rapidly. If the
proportions cited hold constant as the Framenet
database grows, the final database of 5,000 lex-
ical units may contain 250,000 annotated sen-
tences and over half a million tokens of frame
elements.

We have access to it through the courtesy of Oxford University Press; the POS-tagged and lemmatized version we use was prepared by the Institut fiir Maschinelle Sprachverarbeitung of the University of Stuttgart). The These descriptions are based on hand-tagged semantic annotations of example sentences extracted from large text corpora and systematic analysis of the semantic patterns they exemplify by lexicographers and linguists. The primary emphasis of the project therefore is the encoding, by humans, of semantic knowledge in machine-readable </context>

Another program, &amp;quot;whittle&amp;quot; (2.2.3), combines subcorpora in a preselected order, removing very long and very short sentences, and sampling to reduce large subcorpora. • Alembic (3.2) (Mitre, 1998), allows the interactive markup (in SGML) of text files according to predefined tagsets (3.2.1). It is used to introduce frame element annotations into the subcorpora. • Sgmlnorm, etc. (from James Clark&apos;s SGML tool set) are used to validate and manage the SGML files. • Entry Writing Tools (4.2) (in development) • Database management tools to manage the catalog of subcorpora, schedule the work, render the &amp;quot;Eventually, we plan to migrate to an XML data model, which appears to provide more flexibility while reducing complexity.
