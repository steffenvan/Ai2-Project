ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957911482758621">
ASK, A Simple Knowledgeable System, is a total
system for the structuring, manipulation and
communication of information. It is a simple
system in the sense that its development
concentrated on clean engineering solutions to
what could be done now with good response times.
The user interface is a limited dialect of
English. In contrast to expert systems, in which
experts build the knowledge base and users make
use of this expert knowledge, ASK is aimed at the
user who wishes to create, test, modify, extend
and make use of his own knowledge base. It is a
system for a research team, a management or
military staff, or a business office.
This paper is designed to give you a feel for
the general performance of the ASK System and
overview of its operational capabilities. To this
end, the movie you see will continue throughout
the talk. Indeed, the talk itself is a commentary
on this background movie. The movie is bona fide
and in real time, it is of the ASK System in
action. (Many of the illustrations from the movie
are reproduced in the written paper.)
I. ASK AS A DATABASE SYSTEM
A. Examples sA ASK English
To introduce you to ASK, we will start out with
a few examples of queries of a simple data base
concerning ships. The uninitiated user may wish
simply to ask:

B. The ASK Data Structures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.871472571428571">
Although in the terminology of data base
theory. ASK can be considered as an &amp;quot;entity-
relation&amp;quot; system, ASK retains its information in
records which are interlinked in a semantic net.
One reason we refer to ASK as simple is because it
uses only a few kinds of nodes in its semantic
net, namely:
some have the following number attributes:
speed
length
beam
&gt;List the destinations and home port of
each ship.

and the abvious corresponding arcs. We speak of
this as the COAR structure. Attributes are single
valued, e.g., &amp;quot;father&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;home port&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;;
relations may be multiple valued, e.g., &amp;quot;child&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;cargo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;author&amp;quot;. The difference between
attributes and relations can be seen in the
following protocol.
&gt;What is the cargo and home port of the Maru?
cargo home port

&gt;The home port of Maru is Boston.
London has been replaced by Boston as the
home port of Maru.

C. Extending and Modifying the Data
1. Definitions
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.812402333333333">
To make such a system more knowledgeable, one
needs to be able to add definitions that embody
interrelationships among the basic classes,
objects, attributes and relations of the data.
The simplest form of definition is synonym:
&gt;definition:tub:old ship
Defined.
Although this form of definition allows one to
introduce abbreviations and many forms of jargon,
more extensive forms of definition are desirable.
Here are three illustrations using the same &amp;quot;ship&amp;quot;
file as above. In the third definition, note the
use of quotes to create local &amp;quot;variables&amp;quot;.
&gt;definition:long:paper whose number of pages
exceeds 49
Defined.
&gt;definition:long:book whose number of pages
exceeds 800
Defined.

ship whose home port is Naples?

The notion of what is long may be quite
different in another context, say in the context
of bibliography of artificial intelligence
literature.
Most verbs embody knowledge specific to the
application in which they are used, the exceptions
being the copula verbs. Therefore the only verbs
initially known to the ASK System are &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;to have&amp;quot;. The user can add new verbs by
paraphrase.

3. Apaohors: Pronouns Ant Ellipses
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.978287914634146">
In practical systems for experts, abbreviated
forms of addressing the computer are common. Thus
the ability to handle pronominal and elliptical
constructions are of considerable importance.
Although there has been progress in the last few
years in the linguistic understanding of these
constructions, many difficulties remain. However,
building on the work that has been accomplished,
many of these constructions can be handled by the
ASK System. In order to avoid misleading the user
when the computational algorithm does not make the
correct interpretation, echo is used to inform the
user of the interpretation that has been taken.

unknown?

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.675221">
A. Extension Qf COAR 12 Multiple Ob&apos;ect Types
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9935564">
So far we have illustrated ASK capabilities
using only two types of objects:
o individuals, e.g., &amp;quot;John Jones&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Maru&amp;quot;
o numbers, e.g., &amp;quot;34.6 feet&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;length of
Maru&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;number of ships&amp;quot;.
ASK has been designed, however, to facilitate many
kinds of objects. This is a capability orthogonal
to the simple COAR structure in that for any types
of objects there may be corresponding classes,
attributes and relations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.44328">
B. Example: Texts and Text Files
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955506636363637">
E. Diagnostics
Our objectives in the design of ASK are to
respond to the experienced user:
We will illustrate this multiple object type
capability with the additional object type: text.
Once this new object type was added (together with
procedures to manipulate texts, i.e., a &amp;quot;word
processor&amp;quot;) then text classes, individual/text and
text/individual attributes and relations were
immediately available. It was a small task to add
an electronic mail system to ASK; all that was
required was an addition to the authorization
procedure that assigned to each newly authorized
person a new text class as his/her mail box.
This third objective calls for good diagnostics.
The diagnostic capabilities of ASK are illustrated
in the following protocol.
o with the responses s/he desires in at
least 902 of the cases;
o with a response that includes what s/he
desires, but perhaps additional
information also, in 90% of the
remaining cases;
o with a response, although not the
desired one, but one which clearly
indicates the system&apos;s interpretation of
the request in the remaining cases.

C. Adding New Object /2211
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.967548446808511">
Although the ASK System has been designed to
allow the addition of new object types, this can
be done only by an application programmer. The
major obstacle is the necessity to provide a
procedure to initialize instances of the new
object type and procedures that carry out their
intrinsic manipulation. However, we expect the
addition of new object types to be a common
occurrence in the applications of the ASK System.
In any potential app licaion areas, using groups
have accumulations of data already structured in
specific ways and families of procedures that they
have developed to manipulate these structures. In
ASK, they can identify these data structures as a
new object type, design simple syntax for them to
invoke their procedures, and thus embed their
familar objects and manipulations within the ASK
English dialect and within the same context as
other associated aspects of their tasks. The
class, attributed and relation constructions
become immediately available.
At this point, you can list the Directory of
Contexts available to you, create or delete
Contexts, authorize others to use Contexts which
you have created, and enter any of the Contexts in
III. MORE GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE ASK SYSTEM
A. Resoonse Times
The movie, which accompanied the oral
presentation of this paper, demonstrated that the
response time, i.e., the time between completion
of the typing of the input by the user to the
appearance of the response on the terminal, is
very good. But the data bases used in the
illustrations have been small, toy data bases.
The following table gives average response times
for a few cases using larger data bases. The
query used for this illustration is:
&gt;What are the destinations of tankers?
The response time is rather insenstitive to the
total number of individuals, classes, attributes
and relations in the data base, depending
primarily on the size of the relation
(destination) and its argument (tankers). Suppose
that there are m tankers in the data base and that
n individuals have destinations, i.e,, the size of
the destination relation is n. The table gives
time in seconds.

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.989015">
In the terminology of ASK, a user &amp;quot;Context&amp;quot; is
a knowledge base together with the vocabulary and
definitions that go with it. A given user will
usually have several Contexts for various
purposes, some of which may be the small &amp;quot;Ships&amp;quot;
Context, a (truncated) bibliography of Artificial
Intelligence literature and an administrative
Context concerning budget matters.

The Bulk Data Input Dialogue prompts the user
for necessary information to (1) establish the •
physical structure of the data base to be
included, (2) add necessary classes and attributes
as needed for the new data entries. The user also
indicates, using English constructions, the
informational relationships among the fields in
the physical records of the database file that
s/he wishes carried over to the ASK Context.

Other alternative media for user/system
communication are menu boards, selection arrays
and query by example. Many other cryptic ways to
communicate user needs to a knowledgeable system
can be thought of; often the most useful means
will be highly specific to the particular
application. For example, in positioning cargo in
the hold of a ship, one would like to be able to
display the particular cargo space, shoving its
current cargo, and call for and move into place
other items that are to be included.
In the past, enabling the system to respond
more intelligently to the user&apos;s needs required
the provision of elaborate programs since the
user&apos;s tasks may be quite involved, with complex
decision structures. The introduction of terse,
effective communication has incurred long delays
and thus the changing needs of a user had little
chance of being met. In the ASK System, the users
themselves can provide this knowledge. They can
instruct the system on how to elicit the necessary
information and how to complete the required task.
This ASK capability is quite facile, opening the
way for its ubiquitous use in extending the
knowledgeable responsiveness of the computer to
user&apos;s immediate needs. ASK includes two system—
guided dialogues, similar to the Bulk Data Input
dialogue by which users can instruct the System on
how to be more responsive to their needs.
A. Forms AUJ.1111213 kW:28MA
The Form is an efficient means of communication
with which we are all familiar. A number of
computer systems include a Forms package. For
most of these, however, filling in a Form results
only in a document; the Form does not constitute a
medium for interacting with the knowledge base or
controlling the actions of the system. The ASK
Forms capability enlarges the roles and ways in
which Forms can be used as a medium for user
interaction. As the user fills in the fields of a
Form, the System can make use of the information
being supplied to (1) check its consistency with
the data already in the knowledge base and, if
necessary, respond with a diagnostic, (2) fill in
other fields with data developed from the
knowledge base, (3) extend the knowledge base,
adding to the vocabulary and adding or changing
the data itself, (4) file the completed form in
prescribed files or in those indicated by the user
and also mail it to a specified distribution list
through the electronic mail subsystem. Since the
Form processing can check consistency and modify
the knowledge base, Forms can be used to
facilitate data input. Since Form processing can
fill fields in the Form, the forms capability
includes the functions of a report generator.
Letters and memos can be written as special cases
of Form filling, automatically adding dates,
addresses, etc. and filing and dispatching the
result.
It must be easy and natural to add new Forms,
if they are to be a convenient tool. That is the
function of the Forms Designing Dialogue. Much
like the Bulk Data Input Dialogue, the Forms
Designing Dialogue holds a dialogue with the the
user through which s/he can specify the fields of
the Form itself and the processing of the above
kinds to be automatically accomplished at the time
the Form is filled in. Here is a simple example
of a from that was designed using the Forms
Designing Dialogue.

In the day-by-day use of an interactive system,
users are very often involved in repetitive tasks.
They could be relieved of much of the drudgery of
such tasks if the system were more knowledgeable.
Such a knowledgeable system, as it goes about a
task for the user, may need additional information
from the user. What information it needs at a
particular point may depend on earlier user inputs
and the current state of the database.
The user must provide the system with knowledge
of a particular task; more precisely s/he must
program this knowledge into the system. The
result of this programming will be a system guided
dialogue which the user can subsequently initiate
and which will then elicit the necessary inputs.
Using these inputs in conjunction with the
knowledge already available, particularly the data
base, the system completes the task. It is this
system-guided dialogue that the user needs to be
able to design.
In the ASK System, there is a special dialogue
which can be used to design system guided
dialogues to accomplish particular tasks. We call
this the Dialogue Designing Dialogue (DDD). Using
DDD, the user becomes a computer-sided designer.
Since DDD, in conducting its dialogue with the
user, only requires simple responses or responses
phrased in ASK English, the user need have little
programming skill or experience. Using DDD, the
user alone can replace a tedious, repetitive task
with an efficient system guided dialogue, all in a
natural language environment. The ASK Dialogue

<abstract confidence="0.997171733333333">ASK, A Simple Knowledgeable System, is a total system for the structuring, manipulation and of information. It simple in the sense that its concentrated on clean engineering solutions to what could be done now with good response times. The user interface is a limited dialect of English. In contrast to expert systems, in which experts build the knowledge base and users make use of this expert knowledge, ASK is aimed at the user who wishes to create, test, modify, extend and make use of his own knowledge base. It is a system for a research team, a management or military staff, or a business office. This paper is designed to give you a feel for the general performance of the ASK System and overview of its operational capabilities. To this end, the movie you see will continue throughout talk. Indeed, the talk itself commentary on this background movie. The movie is bona fide in real time, it the ASK System in action. (Many of the illustrations from the movie are reproduced in the written paper.) I. ASK AS A DATABASE SYSTEM ExamplessA ASK introduce you to ASK, we a few examples of queries of a simple data base concerning ships. The uninitiated user may wish simply to ask: &gt;Row many ships are there? 7 &gt;What is known about ships? some are in the following classes: Navy freighter old tanker all have the following attributes: destination home port some have the following attributes: cargo all have the following number attributes: age The ASK Data Although in the terminology of data base theory. ASK can be considered as an &amp;quot;entityrelation&amp;quot; system, ASK retains its information in records which are interlinked in a semantic net. One reason we refer to ASK as simple is because it only a few kinds of nodes in semantic net, namely: some have the following number attributes: speed length beam &gt;List the destinations and home port of each ship. ship destination home port</abstract>

We speak of this as the COAR structure.

The difference between attributes and relations can be seen in the following protocol. &gt;What is the cargo and home port of the Maru? cargo home port wheat London &gt;The home port of Maru is Boston.

The simplest form of definition is synonym: &gt;definition:tub:old ship Defined. Although this form of definition allows one to introduce abbreviations and many forms of jargon, more extensive forms of definition are desirable.

Most verbs embody knowledge specific to the application in which they are used, the exceptions being the copula verbs. Therefore the only verbs initially known to the ASK System are &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to have&amp;quot;. The user can add new verbs by paraphrase. &gt;verb:ships &amp;quot;go&amp;quot; to New York:destination of ships is New York Defined. &gt;verb:ships &amp;quot;carry&amp;quot; coal from London to Boston:ships have coal as cargo, have London as home port and go to Boston Defined. &gt;Each old ship carries what cargo to each port? old ship port cargo Ubu New York oil Tokyo oil Alamo London wheat coal 18 &gt;What is carried by the Alamo? wheat coal &gt;Wheat is carried to London from what ports? New York &gt;What cities does the Alamo carry wheat to? London Apaohors: PronounsAnt In practical systems for experts, abbreviated forms of addressing the computer are common. Thus the ability to handle pronominal and elliptical constructions are of considerable importance. Although there has been progress in the last few years in the linguistic understanding of these constructions, many difficulties remain. However, building on the work that has been accomplished, many of these constructions can be handled by the ASK System. In order to avoid misleading the user when the computational algorithm does not make the correct interpretation, echo is used to inform the user of the interpretation that has been taken. )Is there a ship whose destination is unknown? yes is What is it [ship whose destination is unknown)? Saratoga &gt;Is its cargo wheat or coal? its [ship is unknown] cargo wheat or coal? wheat no coal yes &gt;Does the Alamos length exceed that of the Ubu? yes &gt;What about the Northern Star?

<abstract confidence="0.979274150943396">ExtensionQf COAR 12 MultipleOb&apos;ect So far we have illustrated ASK capabilities using only two types of objects: o individuals, e.g., &amp;quot;John Jones&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Maru&amp;quot; o numbers, e.g., &amp;quot;34.6 feet&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;length of Maru&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;number of ships&amp;quot;. ASK has been designed, however, to facilitate many kinds of objects. This is a capability orthogonal to the simple COAR structure in that for any types of objects there may be corresponding classes, attributes and relations. Example:Texts and Files Our objectives in the design of ASK are to respond to the experienced user: We will illustrate this multiple object type capability with the additional object type: text. Once this new object type was added (together with procedures to manipulate texts, i.e., a &amp;quot;word processor&amp;quot;) then text classes, individual/text and text/individual attributes and relations were immediately available. It was a small task to add an electronic mail system to ASK; all that was required was an addition to the authorization procedure that assigned to each newly authorized person a new text class as his/her mail box. This third objective calls for good diagnostics. The diagnostic capabilities of ASK are illustrated following protocol. o with the responses s/he desires in at least 902 of the cases; o with a response that includes what s/he desires, but perhaps additional information also, in 90% of the remaining cases; o with a response, although not the desired one, but one which clearly indicates the system&apos;s interpretation of the request in the remaining cases. &gt;attribute:port The attribute port has been added. &gt;What are the ports and U.S. destinations of the Meru? &gt;Create the text/text relation:comment The text/text relation comment has been added. &gt;Create a file: budget correspondence The text class budget correspondence has been added. &gt;File the Budget Proposal in budget correspondence.

The major obstacle is the necessity to provide a procedure to initialize instances of the new object type and procedures that carry out their intrinsic manipulation. However, we expect the addition of new object types to be a common occurrence in the applications of the ASK System. In any potential app licaion areas, using groups have accumulations of data already structured in specific ways and families of procedures that they have developed to manipulate these structures. In they can data structures as a new object type, design simple syntax for them to invoke their procedures, and thus embed their familar objects and manipulations within the ASK English dialect and within the same context as other associated aspects of their tasks.
