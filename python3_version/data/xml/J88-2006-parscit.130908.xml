In this paper, I consider a range of English expressions and show that their context-dependency can be
characterized in terms of two properties:
1. They specify entities in an evolving model of the discourse that the listener is constructing;
2. The particular entity specified depends on another entity in that part of the evolving &amp;quot;discourse
model&amp;quot; that the listener is currently attending to.
Such expressions have been called anaphors. I show how tensed clauses share these characteristics,
usually just attributed to anaphoric noun phrases. This not only allows us to capture in a simple way the
oft-stated but difficult-to-prove intuition that tense is anaphoric, but also contributes to our knowledge
of what is needed for understanding narrative text.

entity in that part of the evolving &amp;quot;discourse
model&amp;quot; that the listener is currently attending to.
Two types of expressions have previously been de-
scribed in these terms: definite pronouns and certain
definite noun phrases (NPs). Researchers in computa-
tional linguistics and in artificial intelligence have called
these expressions anaphors (cf., Woods 1978, Sidner
1983, Bobrow 1977, Hirst 1981, Webber 1983).
Linguists, however, have used this term somewhat
differently. Many have restricted its use to expressions
(usually pronouns) that can be treated analogously to
variables in a logical language (Chomsky 1980). A view
in linguistics that comes somewhat closer to the Al
model can be found in a paper by Sag and Hankamer
(1984), who distinguish what they call deep (or model-
interpretive) anaphora from what they call surface ana-
phora (or ellipsis). Under the former, they include
personal pronouns, sentential &amp;quot;it,&amp;quot; and null-comple-
ment anaphora, and under the latter, verb phrase (VP)
ellipsis, sluicing, gapping, and stripping. The two types
are distinguished by whether they make reference to the
interpretation of an antecedent—i.e., some object in a
model of the world constructed by the interpreter of the
sentence of discourse (deep anaphora)—or whether
they are interpreted with respect to a previous logical
form (surface anaphora). While their deep anaphors
include pronouns, Hankamer and Sag do not consider
other expressions like NPs in discourse that might also
be described in similar model-interpretive terms, nor do
they describe in any detail how model interpretation
works for the expressions they consider.
To avoid confusion then, I will use the term discourse
anaphors for expressions that have these two
properties.&apos; My main point will be that tensed clauses
share these properties as well, and hence should also be
considered discourse anaphors. This will capture in a
simple way the oft-stated, but difficult-to-prove intu-
ition that tense is anaphoric.
To begin with, in Section 2, I characterize the depen-
dency of an anaphoric expression Xb on a discourse
entity Ea in terms of an anaphoric function a(Xb,Ea),
that itself depends on 1. the ontology of the specified
entity Ea and 2. discourse structure and its focusing
effect on which Ea entities the listener is attending to.
With respect to definite pronouns and NPs, this will
essentially be a review of previous research. However,
I will argue that some indefinite NPs should also be
considered discourse anaphors in just this same way. In
Section 3, I will move on to tensed clauses and the
notion of tense as anaphor, a notion that goes back to at
least Leech in his monograph Meaning and the English

Verb (1987). I will review previous attempts to make the
notion precise, attempts that require special-purpose
machinery to get them to work. Then I will show, in
contrast, that the notion can more simply be made
precise in terms of a set of similar anaphoric functions
that again depend on ontology and discourse structure.
Making clear these dependencies contributes to our
knowledge of what is needed for understanding narra-
tive text.

2.1 DISCOURSE MODELS AND SPECIFICATION
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992612444444445">
The notion specify that I am using in my definition of
discourse anaphora is based on the notion of a Discourse
Model, earlier described in Webber (1983). My basic
premise is that in processing a narrative text, a listener
is developing a model of at least two things: 1. the
entities under discussion, along with their properties
and relationships to one another, and 2. the events and
situations under discussion, along with their relation-
ships to one another (e.g., consequential relations,
simple ordering relations, elaboration relations, etc.).
The representation as a whole I call the listener&apos;s
Discourse Model. 2
In this section, I will focus on NPs. (In Section 3, I
will turn attention to tensed clauses.) NPs may evoke
entities into the listener&apos;s Discourse Model correspond-
ing to individuals (Example 1), sets (Example 2), ab-
stract individuals (Example 3), classes (Example 4),
etc . 3

<bodyText confidence="0.999189705882353">
An NP which evokes a discourse entity also specifies it.
One way an NP would be considered anaphoric by the
above definition would be if it specified an entity Ea in
the model that had already been evoked by some other
NP. (In that case, one would say that the two NPs
co-specified the same entity.) This basic arrangement is
illustrated in Examples 1-3 above and is shown in
Figure la.5 Formally, one could say that there is an
anaphoric function a, whose value, given the anaphoric
noun phrase NPb and the discourse entity Ea, is Ea
thatis, a(NPb,Ea) = Ea. This can also be read as NPb
specifies Ea by virtue of Ea. Definite pronouns are most
often anaphoric in just this way.
The other way an NP would be considered a dis-
course anaphor would be if it used some existing
discourse entity Ea to evoke and specify a new dis-
course entity Eb, as in

5. a. A bus came round the corner.
b. I signaled to the driver to stop.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998979333333333">
where NPb—the driver—makes use of the entity asso-
ciated with the bus mentioned in 5a to specify a new
entity—the driver of that bus.
Here the anaphoric function is of the form a(NPb,Ea)
= Eb. In cooperative discourse, there have to be
constraints on the value of a(NPb,Ea), since only NPb is
given explicitly. In short, a cooperative speaker must be
able to assume that the listener is able to both infer a
possible a and single out Ea in his/her evolving Dis-
course Mode1.6 (This is illustrated in Figure lb.) I will
consider each of these two types of constraints in turn.
Speakers assume listeners will have no problem with
a when a(NPb,Ea) = Ea. Inferring a in other cases
follows in large part from the ontology of the entities
specified by NPs—i.e., the ontology of our concepts of
individuals, sets, mass terms, generics, etc. We view
these as having parts (e.g., car: the engine, the wheels),
having functional relations (e.g., car: the driver), having
roles (e.g., wedding: the bride), etc. These needn&apos;t be
necessary parts, relations, roles, etc. Our ontology
includes possible parts, relations, etc., and these too
make it possible for the listener to infer an a such that
a(NPb,Ea) = Eb (e.g., room: the chandelier; car: the
chauffeur; wedding: the flower girl). Such inferences
are discussed at length in the literature, including Clark
and Marshall 1981, and Hobbs 1987.7
Before closing this section, there are two more things
to say about NPs. First, the above definition of dis-
course anaphor does not apply to all definite NPs: a
definite NP can be used to refer to something unique in
the speaker and listener&apos;s shared spatio-temporal con-
text (e.g., the telephone—i.e., the one that they both
hear ringing) or their shared culture (e.g., the govern-
ment), to the unique representative of a class (e.g., the
duck-billed platypus), to an entire class or set (e.g., the
stars), or to a functionally defined entity (e.g., the

largest tomato in Scotland). None of these would be
considered discourse anaphoric by the above definition.
Secondly, though the definition implies that one must
consider some indefinite NPs to be discourse anaphors,
since they are essentially parasitic on a corresponding
anaphoric definite NP, as in the following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.915702">
6. a. The driver stopped the bus when a passenger
began to sing, &amp;quot;Aida&amp;quot;.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971538909090909">
b. The driver stopped the bus when the passen-
gers began to sing &amp;quot;Aida&amp;quot;.
The indefinite NP a passenger in (6a) can be para-
phrased as some one of the passengers, and thus is
parasitic on the anaphoric definite NP the passengers
mentioned explicitly in (6b). This does not imply that all
indefinite NPs are discourse anaphors. In Mary met a
boy with green hair or Fred built an oak desk, the
indefinite NPs do not need to be interpreted with
respect to another discourse entity and some inferrable
relationship with that entity, in order to characterize the
discourse entity they specify.
In the next section, I will discuss the second kind of
constraint on the function a(NPb,Ea) necessary for
cooperative use of an anaphor—constraints on identifi-
able Eas. These involve notions of discourse structure
and discourse focus. Before I close, though, I want to
point to where I&apos;m going vis-a-vis the anaphoric char-
acter of tense and tensed clauses. In contrast with
previous accounts of tense as pronoun or tense as
loosely context-dependent, I am going to claim that, like
an anaphoric definite NP,

• a tensed clause Cb may either specify an existing event
or situation Eb in the listener&apos;s Discourse Model, or it
may both evoke and specify a new entity.
• As with anaphoric NPs, there are constraints on
possible anaphoric functions and on the Eas that can
participate in them at any one time.
• These functions are sensitive to that part of a tensed
clause Cb called by Reichenbach (1947) point of
reference (here abbreviated RT), as well as its rela-
tionship to Reichenbach&apos;s point of the event (ET).
• These functions can be defined in part in terms of an
independently justifiable ontology of events proposed
(independently) by Moens and Steedman (this vol-
ume) and Passonneau (this volume).
• The constraints on Ea are tied in with a temporal
analogue of discourse focus that I have called tempo-
ral focus (TF), and through TF, with discourse struc-
ture as well.

2.2 DISCOURSE FOCUS AND DISCOURSE STRUCTURE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964833333334">
The ideas presented in this section have been formu-
lated and developed by Barbara Grosz and Candy
Sidner, originally independently and later in joint re-
search. It is not a summary of their work:8 it is limited
to those of their ideas that are necessary to the concept
of anaphor that I am advancing here and the concept of
tense as anaphor, in particular.
Sidner&apos;s thesis (1979, 1983) presents an account of
understanding definite pronouns and anaphoric definite
NPs that reflects the ease with which people identify the
intended specificand of definite pronouns (except in
highly ambiguous cases), as well as the intended spec-
ificand of anaphoric definite NPs.
With respect to noun phrases (but not clauses),
Sidner makes the same assumption about evoking,
specifying, and co-specifying in a Discourse Model that
I have made here. To understand anaphoric expres-
sions, Sidner postulates three mechanisms:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9991106">
1. a current discourse focus (DF)
2. an ordered list of potential foci (PFL) for the next
utterance
3. a stack for saving the current DF and resuming it
later.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981984214285714">
The DF corresponds to that entity the listener is most
attending to. Pronouns can most easily specify the
current DF, slightly less easily a member of the PFL,
and with slightly more difficulty, a stacked focus.
Specifying an entity pronominally can shift the listen-
er&apos;s attention to it, thereby promoting it to be the next
DF. Anything else specified in the clause ends up on the
PFL, ordered by its original syntactic position. (Sidner
introduced a separate &amp;quot;agent focus&amp;quot; to allow two
entities to be specified pronominally in the same clause,
but it was not a critical feature of her approach.) As for
anaphoric definite NPs, they can specify anything pre-
viously introduced (whether on the PFL, a stacked
focus, or anything else) or anything related in a mutually
inferrable way with the current DF or a member of the
PFL. In terms of the constraints I mentioned above, it
is only those discourse entities that are either the DF or
on the PFL that can serve as Ea for an anaphoric
definite NP.9
In Sidner (1983) DFs always are stacked for possible
resumption later. In Grosz and Sidner (1986) it is an
entire focus space (FS) (Grosz 1977) that gets stacked
(i.e., the collection of entities L is attending to by virtue
of the current discourse segment (DS)) but only when the
9purpose of the current DS is taken to dominate that of
the one upcoming. Dominance relations are also speci-
fied further according to the type of discourse. In Grosz
and Sidner, they are defined for task-related dialogues
and arguments. For example, in arguments, one DS
purpose (DSP) dominates another if the second pro-
vides evidence for a point made in the first. When the
dominated DSP is satisfied, its corresponding FS is
popped. This stack mechanism models the listener&apos;s
attentional state. The relations between DSPs constitute
the intentional structure of the text. Getting a listener to
resume a DS via the stack mechanism is taken to require
less effort on a speaker&apos;s part than returning to elabo-
rate an argument or subtask description later on.
The significance of Sidner (1983) and Grosz and
Sidner (1986) for the current enterprise is that:

</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97675075">
• Sidner essentially shows how DF can move gradually
among the discourse entities that make up a focus
space, as the listener is processing its associated
discourse segment;
• Grosz and Sidner show how DF can make a radical
jump to a different (possibly newly evoked) discourse
entity as the listener moves to process the next
discourse segment.10
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986883125">
I reinterpret this in the current framework in terms of
the anaphoric function a(NPb,Ea). Within a discourse
segment, the entity that is the DF is the most likely Ea.
Over the discourse segment, other discourse entities in
the segment&apos;s focus space may in turn become DF.
With a change in discourse segment, however, the DF
can change radically to an entity in the focus space
associated with the new segment.
To hint again at what is to come: in Section 3.2, I will
propose a temporal analogue of DF, which I have called
temporal focus (TF). In Section 3.3, I will show how
gradual movements of the TF are tied in with the
ontology of what a tensed clause specifies—i.e., an
ontology of events and situations—while more radical
movements reflect the effect of discourse structure on
TF.

3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994203363636364">
Tense may not seem prima facie anaphoric: an isolated
sentence like John went to bed or I met a man who
looked like a basset hound appears to make sense in a
way that a stand-alone He went to bed or The man went
to bed does not. On the other hand, if some time or
event is established by the context (i.e., either by an
event or situation described in the previous discourse or
by a temporal adverbial in the current sentence—cf.
Passonneau, and Moens and Steedman, this volume),
tense will invariably be interpreted with respect to it, as
in:

b. John partied until 3 am. He came home and

<bodyText confidence="0.99709275">
In each case, the interpretation of John&apos;s going to bed is
linked to an explicitly mentioned time or event. This is
what underlies all discussion of the anaphoric quality of
tense.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998832">
3.1 BACKGROUND
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9953015">
The assumption that tense is anaphoric (i.e., that its
interpretation is linked to some time or event derived
from context) goes back many years, although it is not
a universally held belief (cf. Comrie 1985). Leech seems
to express this view in his Meaning and the English
Verb:
63 INDEFINITE TIME Whereas the Present Per-
fect, in its indefinite past sense, does not name a
specific point of time, a definite POINT OF ORI-
ENTATION in the past is normally required for
the appropriate use of the Simple Past Tense. The
point of orientation may be specified in one of
three ways: (a) by an adverbial express of time-
when; (b) by a preceding use of a Past or Perfect
Tense; and (c) by implicit definition; i.e., by
assumption of a particular time from context.
73 The Past Perfect Tense has the meaning of past-
in-the-past, or more accurately, &apos;a time further in
the past, seen from the viewpoint of a definite
point of time already in the past&apos;. That is, like the
Simple Past Tense, the Past Perfect demands an
already established past point of reference.
(Leech: 47)
Leech did not elaborate further on how reference points
are used in the interpretation of simple past tense and
past perfect tense, or on what has become the main
problem in the semantics and pragmatics of tense:
reconciling the (usual) forward movement of events in
narratives with a belief in the anaphoric (or context-
dependent) character of tense.
The first explicit reference I have to tense being
anaphoric like a definite pronoun is in an article by
McCawley (1971:110), who said:
However the tense morpheme does not just express
the time relationship between the clause it is in and
the next higher clause—it also refers to the time of
the clause that it is in, and indeed, refers to it in a way
that is rather like the way in which personal pronouns
refer to what they stand for.
McCawley also tried to fit in his view of tense as
pronoun with the interpretation of tense in simple
narratives. Here he proposed that the event described in
one clause serves as the antecedent of the event de-
scribed in the next, but that it may be related to that
event by being either at the same time or &amp;quot;shortly after&amp;quot;
it. He did not elaborate on when one relation would be
assumed and when the other.
Partee (1973) also noted the similarities between
tense and definite pronouns. However, she subse-
quently recognized that taking simple past tense as
directly analogous with pronouns was incompatible
with the usual forward movement of time in the inter-
pretation in a sequence of sentences denoting events
(Partee 1984). Her response was a modification of the
claim that tense is anaphoric, saying:
I still believe it is reasonable to characterize tense as
anaphoric, or more broadly as context-dependent,
but I would no longer suggest that this requires them
to be viewed as &apos;referring&apos; to times as pronouns
&apos;refer&apos; to entities, or to treat times as arguments of
predicates (256).
The particular context-dependent process she proposes
for interpreting tensed clauses follows that of Hinrichs
1986, briefly described below.
The examples presented above to illustrate the ana-
phoric quality of tense were all simple past. However,
as Leech notes (see above), the past perfect also makes
demands on having some reference point already estab-

Bonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor
lished in the context. Thus it cannot be in terms of the
event described in a tensed clause that tense is anapho-
ric. Instead, several people (Steedman 1982, Hinrichs
1986, Bauerle 1979) have argued that it is that part of
tense called by Reichenbach (1947) the point of refer-
ence (here abbreviated RT) that is anaphoric. This can
be seen by considering the following example:
8. a. John went to the hospital.
b. He had twisted his ankle on a patch of ice.
It is not the point of the event (here abbreviated ET) of
John&apos;s twisting his ankle that is interpreted anaphori-
cally with respect to his going to the hospital. Rather, it
is the RT of the second clause: its ET is interpreted as
prior to that because the clause is in the past perfect (see
above).
I will now review briefly Hinrichs&apos;s proposal as to
how tensed clauses are interpreted in context, in order
to contrast it with the current proposal.
In Hinrichs 1986, Hinrichs makes the simplifying
assumption that in a sequence of simple past sentences,
the temporal order of events described cannot contra-
dict the order of the sentences. This allows him to focus
on the problem of characterizing those circumstances in
which the event described by one sentence follows that
described by the previous one (Example 9—Hinrichs&apos;s
Example 15) and when it overlaps it (Example 10—
Hinrichs&apos; s Example 21):
9. The elderly gentleman wrote out the check, tore
it from the book, and handed it to Costain.
10. Mr. Darby slapped his forehead, then collected
himself and opened the door again. The brush
man was smiling at him hesitantly.
Hinrichs bases his account on the Aktionsart of a tensed
clause (i.e., its Vendlerian classification as an accom-
plishment, achievement, activity, or state—including
progressives). Assuming an initial reference point in a
discourse, the event described by a tensed clause inter-
preted as an accomplishment or achievement will be
included in that reference point and will also introduce
a new reference point ordered after the old one. Events
associated with the other Aktionsarten include the cur-
rent reference point in the event time. This means that
given a sequence of two clauses interpreted as accom-
plishments or achievements, their corresponding events
will follow one another (cf. Example 9). On the other
hand, given a sequence with at least one tensed clause
interpreted as an activity or state (including progres-
sive), their corresponding events will be interpreted as
overlapping each other (cf. Example 10).
Hinrichs relates his reference point to that of Rei-
chenbach. (Thus, the anaphoric character of tense is
based on RT and not on the events directly.) However,
Hinrichs&apos;s notion and Reichenbach&apos;s differ with respect
to the time of the event described in the tensed clause.
While Reichenbach talks about ET and RT being the
same for nonprogressive past-tense clauses, in Hin-
richs&apos;s account the reference point can fall after the
event if a nonprogressive past is interpreted as an
accomplishment or an achievement. This is necessary
to achieve the forward movement of narrative that
Hinrichs assumes is always the case (his simplifying
assumption) but it is not the same as Reichenbach&apos;s RT.
It also leads to problems in cases where this simplifying
assumption is just wrong—where in a sequence of
simple past tenses, there is what appears to be a
&amp;quot;backward&amp;quot; movement of time, as in
11. a. For an encore, John played the &amp;quot;Moonlight
Sonata&amp;quot;.
b. The opening movement he took rather tenta-
tively, but then . . .
where the second clause should be understood as de-
scribing the beginning of the playing event in more
detail, not as describing a subsequent event.
In the account given below, both forward and back-
ward movement of time fall out of the anaphoric char-
acter of tensed clauses, and the dependency of dis-
course anaphora on discourse structure.&amp;quot;

3.2 TENSE AS DISCOURSE ANAPHOR: IN WHAT SENSE
&amp;quot;SPECIFY&amp;quot;?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98018575">
With that background, I will now show how tensed
clauses share the two properties I set out in Section 1
(repeated here) and hence are further examples of
discourse anaphora:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9865488">
1. Anaphors specify entities in an evolving model of
the discourse that the listener is constructing;
2. the particular entity specified depends on another
entity in that part of the evolving Discourse Model
that the listener is currently attending to.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999394652173913">
To do this, I need to explain the sense in which tensed
clauses specify and the way in which that specification
can depend on another element in the current context.
Recall that I presume that a listener&apos;s developing
discourse model represents both the entities being dis-
cussed, along with their properties and relations, and
the events and situations being discussed, along with
their relationships with another. For the rest of this
paper, I want to ignore the former and focus on the
latter. This I will call event/situation structure, or E/S
structure. It represents the listener&apos;s best effort at
interpreting the speaker&apos;s ordering of those events and
situations in time and space. One problem in text
understanding, then, is that of establishing where in the
evolving E/S structure to integrate the event or situation
description in the next clause.
In this framework, a tensed clause Cb provides two
pieces of semantic information: (a) a description of an

ET, RT, and point of speech (abbreviated ST). (Here I

events in the model follows (in part) from Cb&apos;s particu-
lar configuration of ET, RT, and ST. Both the charac-
teristics of Eb (i.e., its ontology) and the configuration
of ET, RT, and ST are critical to my account of tense as
discourse anaphor.
The event ontology I assume follows that of Moens
and Steedman (this volume) and of Passonneau (this
volume). Both propose that people interpret events as
having a tripartite structure (a &amp;quot;nucleus&amp;quot; in Moens and
Steedman&apos;s terminology) consisting of a preparatory
phase (prep), a culmination (cul), and a consequent
phase (conseq)—as in Figure 2. This tripartite structure
permits a uniform account to be given of aspectual types
in English and of how the interpretation of temporal
adverbials interacts with the interpretation of tense and
aspect. For example, the coercion of clauses from one
interpretation to another is defined in terms of which
parts of a nucleus they select and how those parts are
described.I2

The ET/RT/ST configuration is significant in that, like
Steedman 1982, Dowty 1986, Hinrichs 1986, and Partee
1984, I take RT as the basis for anaphora. To indicate
this, I single it out as an independent argument to
anaphoric functions, here labelled 0. In particular, the
following schema holds of a clause Cb linked anaphori-
cally to an event Ea through its RT:

<equation confidence="0.686653">
13(Cb, Ea, RTb) = Eb

In this case, the relationship between Eb and E„ then

way with Ea. This is shown in Figure 3a. If ETb &lt; RTb
(as in the perfect tenses), Eb is taken to precede Ea. This
is shown in Figure 3d.
Alternatively, 0 may embody part of the tripartite
ontology of events mentioned earlier: 13prep links RTb to
the preparatory phase of Ea (as shown in Figure 3b)—

culmination of Ea—but it is not clear to me that it could
be distinguished from the simpler 00 function given
above, which links RTb to Ea itself. Also, while [3prep

possible for a perfect, it is not clear to me that these
cases could be distinguished from the simpler 0o. In the
case of perfects therefore, the relation between Eb and
Ea is correspondingly indirect.13
The following example illustrates the case where 0 =

12. a. John played the piano.
b. Mary played the kazoo.
Sentence 12a. evokes a new event entity Ea describable
as the event of John playing the piano. Since the tense
of (12b) is simple past, ETb = RTb. Given 130(Cb,Ea,
RTb) = Eb, then Eb is interpreted as coextensive with
Ea. (Whether this is further interpreted as two simulta-
neous events or a single event of their playing a duet
depends on context and, perhaps, world knowledge as
well.) This is illustrated in Figure 4. Example 8 (re-
peated here) illustrates the case /30 where ETb &lt; RTb.

To summarize, I have claimed that: 1. the notion of
specification makes sense with respect to tensed
clauses; 2. one can describe the anaphoric relation in
terms of the RT of a tensed clause Cb, its ET/RT
configuration, and an existing event or situation entity
Ea—that is, p(Cb,Ea,RTb) = Eb; and 3. there are (at
least) three 13 functions—one, po, linking RTb to Ea
itself, the other two (Pprep and .Bconseq) embodying parts
of a tripartite ontology of events. In the next section, I
will discuss constraints on the second argument to
p(Cb,Ea,RTb)—that is, constraints on which entities in
the evolving E/S structure the specification of a tensed
clause can depend on.

3.3 TEMPORAL FOCUS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958714285714">
Recall from Section 2.2 that Sidner introduced the
notion of a dynamically changing discourse focus (DF) to
capture the intuition that at any point in the discourse,
there is one discourse entity that is the prime focus of
attention and that is the most likely (although not the
only possible) specificand of a definite pronoun. In
parallel, I propose a dynamically changing temporal
focus (TF), to capture a similar intuition that at any
point in the discourse, there is one entity in E/S struc-
ture that is most attended to and hence most likely to
stand in an anaphoric relation with the RT of the next
clause. That is, 13(Cb,TF,RTb) = Eb. If Cb is interpreted
as part of the current discourse segment, after its
interpretation there are three possibilities:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9584807">
1. With po, the TF will stay where it is, independent
of whether ET = RT or ET &lt; RT.
2. With Pemseq, RTb&apos;s link to the consequent phase of
the TF locates event Eb there, shifting the TF
forward (to Eb). This is the &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; forward
progression of narrative.
3. With f3prep, RTb&apos;s link to the preparatory phase of
the TF locates Eb there, shifting the TF backward
to (Eb). This is used to elaborate an event or
situation in more detail.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999199857142857">
These relationships, which I will call maintenance and
local movement of the TF, correspond to Sidner&apos;s DF
moving gradually among the discourse entities in a
discourse segment. (They cover the same phenomena as
the micromoves that Nakhimovsky describes in his
paper (this volume).) More radical movement of TF
correspond to changes in discourse structure. (These

in Nakhimovsky, also this volume.) In cases involving
movements into and out of an embedded discourse
segment, either 1. the TF will shift to a different entity
in E/S structure—either an existing entity or one cre-
ated in recognition of an embedded narrative; or 2. it
will return to the entity previously labeled TF, after
completing an embedded narrative. Such movements
are described in Section 3.3.2. Other movements, sig-
naled by temporal adverbials and when clauses, are not

First consider Example 13. The first clause (13a) evokes
an event entity Ea describable as John&apos;s going into the
florist shop. Since its tense is simple past, Ea is inter-
preted as prior to ST. Since it begins the discourse, its
status is special vis-a-vis both definite NPs and tensed
clauses. That is, since no previous TF will have been
established yet, the listener takes that entity Ea to serve
as TF.&apos; 5 This is shown in Figure 8:
Partee, and Dowty were out to achieve. Here it falls out
simply from the discourse notion of a TF and from the
particular anaphoric function Pconseq• 16
Now consider Example 15 (repeated here) whose
first clause is the same as Example 13a and hence would
be processed in the same way.

RT,5b. Hence the consequent phase of Eb overlaps Ea.
Finally since TF is associated with the event entity at
RTb, it remains at Ea. E/S structure at this point

Pconseq on the basis of world knowledge—that is,

new entity Eb, located within the consequent phase of
the TF—that is, Ea—and hence after it. I assume that,
following the computation of the anaphoric function, TF
becomes associated with the event entity located at
RTb. In this case, it is Eb, and TF thereby moves
forward (cf. Figure 9). As noted, this is the gradual

To illustrate the effect of discourse structure on TF,
consider the following variation on Example 15, which
had the same structure vis-a-vis sequence of tenses.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.650245666666667">

The first two clauses (a) and (b) are the same as in
Example 15 and lead to the same configuration of event
entities in E/S structure (as shown in Figure 10). But the
most plausible interpretation of (16c) is where the
&amp;quot;saying&amp;quot; event is interpreted anaphorically with respect
to the &amp;quot;promising&amp;quot; event—that is, where (16b–c) are
taken together as (the start of) an embedded discourse,
describing an event prior to John&apos;s going to the florist&apos;s.
To handle this, I assume, following Grosz and Sidner
1986, that when the listener recognizes an embedded
discourse segment, s/he stores the current TF for pos-
sible resumption later.17 However, I also assume the
listener recognizes the embedding not when s/he first
encounters a perfect-tensed clause Cb, since it needn&apos;t
signal an embedded discourse, but later, when an
immediately following simple past tense clause Cc is
most sensibly interpreted with respect to the event
entity Ei, that Cb evoked.18 At this point, the listener
moves TF from its current position to Eb, caching the
previous value for possible resumption later. Following
this gross movement, 13(Cc,TF,RTc) will be computed.
If is then interpreted as B there will be
conseq or Pprepl
a second movement of TF.&apos;9
Coming back to Example 16, if Clause 16c is taken as
being part of a single discourse segment with (16a–b),
she saying something would have to be interpreted with
respect to the current TF (Ea)—John&apos;s going to the
florist. This is implausible under all possible interpreta-
tions of 0.20 However, under the assumption that Et, is
part of an embedded narrative, the listener can a
posteriori shift TF to El, and consider the anaphoric
relation

i3(C 16C TF, RT16C) = E16c
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.958063307692308">
with Et, as TF. At this point, the listener can plausibly
take p to be B
,--conseq based on world knowledge. Since
(16c) is simple past, ETc = RT, the &amp;quot;saying&amp;quot; event Ec
is viewed as part of the consequent phase (and hence
following) the &amp;quot;promising&amp;quot; event Eb. As in the first
case, TF moves to the event located at RT—i.e., to E.
This is shown roughly in Figure 12. Notice that this
involved two movements of TF—once in response to a
perceived embedded segment and a second time, in
response to interpreting /3 as B
r-conseq•
Now consider the following extension to (16):

<listItem confidence="0.900468666666667">

d. So he picked out three red roses, two white
ones, and one pale pink.
As before, Clauses 17b–c form an embedded narrative,
but here the main narrative of John&apos;s visit to the florist
shop, started at (17a), is continued at (17d). To handle
this, I again assume that TF behaves much like Sidner&apos;s
DF in response to the listener&apos;s recognition of the end of
an embedded narrative: that is, the cached TF is re-
sumed and processing continues.21

Under this assumption, Clauses 17a–c are interpreted
as in the previous example (cf. Figure 12). Recognizing
Clause 17d as resuming the embedding segment,22 the
previously cached TF (Ea—the going into the florist
shop event) is resumed. Again assume that the listener
takes the anaphoric function to be Pconseq(Cd,TF,RTd)
= Ed on the basis of world knowledge. Since Clause 17d
is simple past (ET = RT), the picking out roses event Ed
is viewed as part of the consequent phase and hence
following the going into the florist shop event. This is

Now getting the listener to interpret a text as an
embedded narrative requires providing him/her with
another event or situation that TF can move to. One
way in English is via a perfect-tensed clause, which
Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 69
Bonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor
explicitly evokes another event, temporally earlier than
the one currently in focus. Another way is by lexical
indications of an embedded narrative, such as verbs of
telling and NPs that themselves denote events or situa-
tions (e.g., ones headed by de-verbal nouns).
This is illustrated in Example 18. Even though all its
clauses are simple past (ET = RT), Clauses 18c–d are
most plausibly interpreted as indirect speech describing
an event that has occurred prior to the &amp;quot;telling&amp;quot; event.
I assume that in response to recognizing this kind of
embedded narrative, the listener creates a new node of
E/S structure and shifts TF there, caching the previous
value of TF for possible resumption later. The temporal
location of this new node vis-a-vis the previous TF will
depend on information in the tensed clause and on the
listener&apos;s world knowledge.

<bodyText confidence="0.996670571428572">
Notice that, as with embedded narratives cued by the
use of a perfect tense, caching the previous TF for
resumption later enables the correct interpretation of
Clause 18e, which is most plausibly interpreted as
following the telling about her sister event.
An NP denoting an event or situation (such as one
headed by a noun like trip or by a de-verbal noun like
installation) can also signal the upcoming possibility of
an embedded narrative that will elaborate that event or
situation (past, upcoming, or hypothetical) in more
detail, as in Example 19. In this case, the original NP
and the subsequent clause(s) will be taken as co-
specifying the same thing. The question here is how and
when TF moves.

<bodyText confidence="0.987964933333333">
c. She spent five weeks above the Arctic Circle
with two friends.
d. The three of them climbed Mt. McKinley.
After interpreting Clause 19b, the TF is at the &amp;quot;telling&amp;quot;
event. I claim that the NP her trip to Alaska, while
evoking a discourse entity, does not affect the TF. If
Clause 19c is interpreted as the start of an embedded
narrative (as it is here), TF moves to the event entity Ec
it evokes (caching the previous value Eb). At this point,
using additional reasoning, the listener may recognize
an anaphoric relation between Clause 19c and the
discourse entity evoked by her trip to Alaska. Support
for this, rather than assuming that an event-denoting NP
sets up a potential focus, just as I claim a perfect-tensed
clause does, comes from the reasoning required to
understand the following parallel example, where I
would claim TF does not move.
I was talking with Mary yesterday.
She told me about her trip to Alaska.
She had spent five weeks above the Arctic
Circle with two friends.
The three of them had climbed Mt. McKinley.
She said that next year they would go for
Aconcagua.
The event described in Clause 20c is the same as that
described in Clause 19c, and should be interpreted
anaphorically with respect to the entity her trip to
Alaska in the same way. If this is the case, however,
then the anaphoric link does not follow from the move-
ment of TF.

<bodyText confidence="0.959016081081081">
Example 20 above illustrates one case of an anaphoric
function on an NP and a tensed clause, specifically
B(Cb,E„,RTb) where the entity Ea has been evoked by
an NP rather than a clause. Another possibility is that
a(NPb,Ea) = Eb, where NPb is definite by virtue of an
entity evoked by a clause rather than an NP—that is,
Eb, is associated with either the preparatory/culmina-
tion/consequent structure of Ea, as in
21. a. Mary climbed Mt. McKinley.
b. The preparations took her longer than the
ascent.
or its associated role structure, as in
22. a. John bought a television.
b. Although he had intended to buy a 13&amp;quot; b/w
set, the salesman convinced him to buy a 25&amp;quot;
color, back-projection job.
where the salesman fills a particular role in the buying
event.
Next, notice that ambiguities arise when there is
more than one way to plausibly segment the discourse,
as in the following example:
23. a. I told Frank about my meeting with Ira.
b. We talked about ordering a Butterfly.
Here it is plausible to take Clause 23b as the beginning
of an embedded narrative, whereby the &amp;quot;talking about&amp;quot;
event is interpreted against a new node of E/S structure,
situated prior to the &amp;quot;telling Frank&amp;quot; event. (In this case,
we is Ira and me.) It is also plausible to take (23b) as
continuing the current narrative, whereby the &amp;quot;talking
about&amp;quot; event is interpreted with respect to the &amp;quot;telling
Frank&amp;quot; event. (In contrast here, we is Frank and me.)
Finally, consider things from the point of view of
generation. If some event Eb is part of the preparatory
phase of some event Ea, and a description of Ea has just
been generated using the simple past tense, then Eb
could be described using either the simple past, as in
Example 24 or past perfect, as in Example 25.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953857142857">
In this paper, I have presented a uniform characteriza-
tion of discourse anaphora in a way that includes
definite pronouns, definite NPs, and tensed clauses. In
doing so, I have argued that the successful use of
discourse anaphors depends on two different things: 1.
speakers&apos; and listeners&apos; (mutual) beliefs about the on-
tology of the things and events being discussed, and 2.
speakers&apos; and listeners&apos; (mutual) focus of attention. The
former implicates semantics in the explanation of dis-
course anaphora, the latter, discourse itself. It is impor-
tant that we as researchers recognize these as two
separate systems, as the properties of discourse as an
explanatory device are very different from those of
semantics.

NOTES
1. Computationally, these properties imply particular things about
processing. For example, in interpreting an NP, one may always
have to consider the possibility—probably in parallel with other
possibilities—that it is a discourse anaphor. For this alternative,
the processor will need to (a) keep track of entities whose
specification the NP may depend on and (b) make appropriate
inferences with respect to these entities. Other forms of context
dependencies will have other implications for processing. In this
paper, I will touch on processing issues for discourse anaphora,
but not other context-dependent phenomena.
2. In earlier work, it was only the former that I discussed under the
concept of Discourse Model. The notion is not all that different
from Kamp&apos;s &amp;quot;Discourse Representation Structures&amp;quot; (Kamp
1984) or Heim&apos;s &amp;quot;File Cards&amp;quot; (Heim 1982).
3. This does not mean that all NPs evoke entities in the listener&apos;s
Discourse Model: for example, I would not want to say that a
predicate nominal (as in &amp;quot;John is a neuro-surgeon.&amp;quot;) evokes a
separate entity. On the other hand, I do assume that NPs in a
quantified context evoke discourse entities that are accessible as
long as that context holds. For example, &amp;quot;Whenever a philoso-
pher debates a computer scientist, the philosopher turns out to
have a naive idea of what the computer scientist is doing. Of
course, the computer scientist always does her best to explain.&amp;quot;
(I thank Rich Thomason for the example.) Keith Stenning has
also discussed examples such as this one.
4. In this use of &amp;quot;specify&amp;quot;, I am following Sidner, who used it to
mean, essentially, refer in a model, as opposed to refer in the
outside world (cf. Sidner 1983).
5. Note that a discourse entity may or may not stand for some
real-world individual or set. Whether it does or doesn&apos;t, how-
ever, is irrelevant to these model-based notions of evoke,
specify, and co-specify.
6. As with any aspect of discourse that relies on the speaker making
assumptions about the listener&apos;s knowledge, those assumptions
may in some cases be wrong. Listeners, for their part, try to do
their best in making sense anyhow—for example, hoping that the
further discourse will provide enough information to work things
out.
7. The inferability of a in other cases follows from the ontology of
entities specified clausally. This I will touch upon in Section 3.
Often a speaker can assume that a relates an individual to the
generic class it belongs to, as in Example 4, or the intension of
a definite description to its extension—or vice versa—as in &amp;quot;The
President is elected by the Electoral College. In the 1964
election, he got all but two of the votes.&amp;quot; I am not claiming that
all inferrable a&apos;s follow from ontology—only that ontology
sanctifies a great many.
8. Nor does it indicate wholesale acceptance of their theory of
discourse as has so far emerged. I believe that they would be the
first to admit that it&apos;s a &amp;quot;theory in progress&amp;quot;.
9. Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983) have reinterpreted part of
Sidner&apos;s work in terms of their theory of centering. Her DF
becomes their &amp;quot;backward-looking center&amp;quot; Cb and her PFL
becomes their ordered list of &amp;quot;forward-looking centers&amp;quot; Cf.
They have proposed heuristics for which entities (Cb and/or Cs)
will be specified pronominally (when specified at all) and for the
consequences for such specification on subsequent Cb and Cfs.
10. This jump is not necessary: the DF can stay the same over
discourse segments—for example, discussing the same entity
from different points of view.
11. Dowty 1986 gives an account similar to Hinrichs&apos;s in its a priori
assumption of the non-backward-movement of time in simple
narratives and its focus on how different aksionart lead to
interpretation of co-temporal versus subsequent events. The two
accounts differ in how the latter is achieved. Dowty&apos;s account
avoids some problems that Hinrichs&apos;s cannot, but still cannot
deal with the fact that time sometimes &amp;quot;moves backwards&amp;quot; even
in sequences of simple past tense.
12. The ontology of an event/situation also includes its role struc-
ture. This latter appears to play a part in possible anaphoric
relations between an NP and an event entity, but not between a
tensed clause and an event entity.
13. I have not considered other aspectual types in English (such as
progressive) vis-h-vis possible anaphoric relations. Integrating
the current account with work on aspect and Aktionsarten, [cf.
Moens &amp; Steedman, Passonneau, Hinrichs, Nakhimovsky—this
volume] is left to future work.
14. I should also note that Rohrer 1985 suggests that there may exist
a set of possible temporal referents, possibly ordered by sa-
liency, among which the tense in a sentence may find its
reference time, but doesn&apos;t elaborate how. That is the only thing
I have seen that comes close to the current proposal.
15. This is similar to the listener&apos;s response to the definite NP the
florist shop, which in the middle of a discourse would have to be
taken anaphorically. At the beginning of a discourse, the listener
will just create a new discourse entity.
16. In parallel with this, given pprep, TF will move incrementally
back into the preparatory phase of the event that was the
previous TF. Given 00, RT, is at the TF and TF does not move.
17. While Sidner and thereafter Grosz &amp; Sidner assume a stack of
focus spaces with their associated DFs, each of which is
resumable, I do not have evidence that the listener can keep
track of more than one other node of E/S structure in addition to
the TF. Resuming any other node seems to require more effort—
such as using a when clause. Hence I assume a single item cache
for the previous value of TF.
18. One could say, in parallel with Sidner 1983, that this Eb was a
potential focus (PF). However, I do not postulate a Potential
Focus List as in Sidner, because I do not think there is ever more
than one PF that one can shift to without using a temporal
adverbial.
19. This is clearly an inertial strategy: it assumes that the listener
will prefer to interpret clauses as being in the same discourse
segment, unless forced to do otherwise, say by a continuation
such as (16c) or a lexical item that signals a possible embedded
narrative. This I will discuss later on. In spoken text, the speaker
might give an intonation to (16b) that conveys that it and the
following clauses should be understood as an embedded dis-
course segment. This would be what breaks the inertia and
causes the listener to shift the TF.
20. is rarely the case that one cannot come up with a story linking
two events and/or situations. Thus it would be impossible to
reject a hypothesis on grounds of inconsistency. All one can say
is that one of such stories might be more plausible than the
72 Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988
Bonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor
others by requiring, in some sense not explored here, fewer
inferences. Crain and Steedman 1985 make a similar argument
about prepositional phrase (PP) attachment. For example, it is
not impossible for a cat to own a telescope—e.g., by inheritance
from its former owner. Thus a cat with a telescope is not an
inconsistent description. However, it must compete with other
plausible interpretations like seeing with a telescope in I saw a
cat with a telescope. Thus I assume that interpretations are
computed in parallel, with the most plausible prediction being
the one that ends up updating both E/S structure and the TF.
21. Recall my prediction that if any but the most recently cached TF
is to be resumed, a cooperative speaker will explicitly indicate
this with a temporal adverbial or a when clause.
22. So is one cue. In spoken discourse, intonation would be another.

Two types of expressions have previously been described in these terms: definite pronouns and certain definite noun phrases (NPs). Researchers in computational linguistics and in artificial intelligence have called these expressions anaphors (cf., Woods 1978, Sidner 1983, Bobrow 1977, Hirst 1981, Webber 1983). Linguists, however, have used this term somewhat differently. Many have restricted its use to expressions (usually pronouns) that can be treated analogously to variables in a logical language (Chomsky 1980). A view in linguistics that comes somewhat closer to the Al model can be found in a paper by Sag and Hankamer (1984), who distinguish what they call deep (or modelinterpretive) anaphora from what they call surface anaphora (or ellipsis). Under the former, they include personal pronouns, sentential &amp;quot;it,&amp;quot; and null-complement anaphora, and under the latter, verb phrase (VP) ellipsis, sluicing, gapping, and stripping.

Such inferences are discussed at length in the literature, including Clark and Marshall 1981, and Hobbs 1987.7 Before closing this section, there are two more things to say about NPs. First, the above definition of discourse anaphor does not apply to all definite NPs: a definite NP can be used to refer to something unique in the speaker and listener&apos;s shared spatio-temporal context (e.g., the telephone—i.e., the one that they both hear ringing) or their shared culture (e.g., the government), to the unique representative of a class (e.g., the duck-billed platypus), to an entire class or set (e.g., the stars), or to a functionally defined entity (e.g., the NP evoke specify —Eb NP NPb a</context>

In each case, the interpretation of John&apos;s going to bed is linked to an explicitly mentioned time or event. This is what underlies all discussion of the anaphoric quality of tense. 3.1 BACKGROUND The assumption that tense is anaphoric (i.e., that its interpretation is linked to some time or event derived from context) goes back many years, although it is not a universally held belief (cf. Comrie 1985). Leech seems to express this view in his Meaning and the English Verb: 63 INDEFINITE TIME Whereas the Present Perfect, in its indefinite past sense, does not name a specific point of time, a definite POINT OF ORIENTATION in the past is normally required for the appropriate use of the Simple Past Tense. The point of orientation may be specified in one of three ways: (a) by an adverbial express of timewhen; (b) by a preceding use of a Past or Perfect Tense; and (c) by implicit definition; i.e., by assumption of a particular time from context. 73 The Past Perfect Tense has the meaning of pastin-</context>

To handle this, I assume, following Grosz and Sidner 1986, that when the listener recognizes an embedded discourse segment, s/he stores the current TF for possible resumption later.17 However, I also assume the listener recognizes the embedding not when s/he first encounters a perfect-tensed clause Cb, since it needn&apos;t signal an embedded discourse, but later, when an immediately following simple past tense clause Cc is most sensibly interpreted with respect to the event entity Ei, that Cb evoked.18 At this point, the listener moves TF from its current position to Eb, caching the previous value for possible resumption later.

Her response was a modification of the claim that tense is anaphoric, saying: I still believe it is reasonable to characterize tense as anaphoric, or more broadly as context-dependent, but I would no longer suggest that this requires them to be viewed as &apos;referring&apos; to times as pronouns &apos;refer&apos; to entities, or to treat times as arguments of predicates (256). The particular context-dependent process she proposes for interpreting tensed clauses follows that of Hinrichs 1986, briefly described below. The examples presented above to illustrate the anaphoric quality of tense were all simple past. However, as Leech notes (see above), the past perfect also makes demands on having some reference point already estab64 Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 Bonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor lished in the context. Thus it cannot be in terms of the event described in a tensed clause that tense is anaphoric. Instead, several people (Steedman 1982, Hinrichs 1986, Bauerle 1979) have argued that it is that part of tense called by Reichenbach (19</context>

John went to the hospital. b. He had twisted his ankle on a patch of ice. It is not the point of the event (here abbreviated ET) of John&apos;s twisting his ankle that is interpreted anaphorically with respect to his going to the hospital. Rather, it is the RT of the second clause: its ET is interpreted as prior to that because the clause is in the past perfect (see above). I will now review briefly Hinrichs&apos;s proposal as to how tensed clauses are interpreted in context, in order to contrast it with the current proposal. In Hinrichs 1986, Hinrichs makes the simplifying assumption that in a sequence of simple past sentences, the temporal order of events described cannot contradict the order of the sentences. This allows him to focus on the problem of characterizing those circumstances in which the event described by one sentence follows that described by the previous one (Example 9—Hinrichs&apos;s Example 15) and when it overlaps it (Example 10— Hinrichs&apos; s Example 21): 9.

They specify entities in an evolving model of the discourse that the listener is constructing; 2. the particular entity specified depends on another entity in that part of the evolving &amp;quot;discourse model&amp;quot; that the listener is currently attending to. Two types of expressions have previously been described in these terms: definite pronouns and certain definite noun phrases (NPs). Researchers in computational linguistics and in artificial intelligence have called these expressions anaphors (cf., Woods 1978, Sidner 1983, Bobrow 1977, Hirst 1981, Webber 1983). Linguists, however, have used this term somewhat differently. Many have restricted its use to expressions (usually pronouns) that can be treated analogously to variables in a logical language (Chomsky 1980). A view in linguistics that comes somewhat closer to the Al model can be found in a paper by Sag and Hankamer (1984), who distinguish what they call deep (or modelinterpretive) anaphora from what they call surface anaphora (or ellipsis).

First, the above definition of discourse anaphor does not apply to all definite NPs: a definite NP can be used to refer to something unique in the speaker and listener&apos;s shared spatio-temporal context (e.g., the telephone—i.e., the one that they both hear ringing) or their shared culture (e.g., the government), to the unique representative of a class (e.g., the duck-billed platypus), to an entire class or set (e.g., the stars), or to a functionally defined entity (e.g., the NP evoke specify —Eb NP NPb a co-specify evok</context>

(Leech: 47) Leech did not elaborate further on how reference points are used in the interpretation of simple past tense and past perfect tense, or on what has become the main problem in the semantics and pragmatics of tense: reconciling the (usual) forward movement of events in narratives with a belief in the anaphoric (or contextdependent) character of tense. The first explicit reference I have to tense being anaphoric like a definite pronoun is in an article by McCawley (1971:110), who said: However the tense morpheme does not just express the time relationship between the clause it is in and the next higher clause—it also refers to the time of the clause that it is in, and indeed, refers to it in a way that is rather like the way in which personal pronouns refer to what they stand for.

(Sidner introduced a separate &amp;quot;agent focus&amp;quot; to allow two entities to be specified pronominally in the same clause, but it was not a critical feature of her approach.) As for anaphoric definite NPs, they can specify anything previously introduced (whether on the PFL, a stacked focus, or anything else) or anything related in a mutually inferrable way with the current DF or a member of the PFL. In terms of the constraints I mentioned above, it is only those discourse entities that are either the DF or on the PFL that can serve as Ea for an anaphoric definite NP.9 In Sidner (1983) DFs always are stacked for possible resumption later. In Grosz and Sidner (1986) it is an entire focus space (FS) (Grosz 1977) that gets stacked (i.e., the collection of entities L is attending to by virtue of the current discourse segment (DS)) but only when the 9purpose of the current DS is taken to dominate that of the one upcoming. Dominance relations are also specified further according to the type of discourse. In Grosz and Sidner, they are defined for task-related dialogues and arguments. For example, in arguments, one DS purpose (DSP) dominates another if the second provides evidence </context>

Thus it cannot be in terms of the event described in a tensed clause that tense is anaphoric. Instead, several people (Steedman 1982, Hinrichs 1986, Bauerle 1979) have argued that it is that part of tense called by Reichenbach (1947) the point of reference (here abbreviated RT) that is anaphoric. This can be seen by considering the following example: 8. a. John went to the hospital. b. He had twisted his ankle on a patch of ice. It is not the point of the event (here abbreviated ET) of John&apos;s twisting his ankle that is interpreted anaphorically with respect to his going to the hospital.

It is not a summary of their work:8 it is limited to those of their ideas that are necessary to the concept of anaphor that I am advancing here and the concept of tense as anaphor, in particular. Sidner&apos;s thesis (1979, 1983) presents an account of understanding definite pronouns and anaphoric definite NPs that reflects the ease with which people identify the intended specificand of definite pronouns (except in highly ambiguous cases), as well as the intended specificand of anaphoric definite NPs. With respect to noun phrases (but not clauses), Sidner makes the same assumption about evoking, specifying, and co-specifying in a Discourse Model that I have made here. To understand anaphoric expressions, Sidner postulates three mechanisms: 1. a current discourse focus (DF) 2. an ordered list of potential foci (PFL) fo</context>

<title>While Sidner and thereafter Grosz &amp; Sidner assume a stack of focus spaces with their associated DFs, each of which is resumable, I do not have evidence that the listener can keep track of more than one other node of E/S structure in addition to the TF. Resuming any other node seems to require more effort— such as using a when clause. Hence I assume a single item cache for the previous value of TF.</title>

<title>One could say, in parallel with Sidner 1983, that this Eb was a potential focus (PF). However, I do not postulate a Potential Focus List as in Sidner, because I do not think there is ever more than one PF that one can shift to without using a temporal adverbial.</title>

<title>This is clearly an inertial strategy: it assumes that the listener will prefer to interpret clauses as being in the same discourse segment, unless forced to do otherwise, say by a continuation such as (16c) or a lexical item that signals a possible embedded narrative. This I will discuss later on. In spoken text, the speaker might give an intonation to (16b) that conveys that it and the following clauses should be understood as an embedded discourse segment. This would be what breaks the inertia and causes the listener to shift the TF.</title>

<rawString>Bonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor others by requiring, in some sense not explored here, fewer inferences. Crain and Steedman 1985 make a similar argument about prepositional phrase (PP) attachment. For example, it is not impossible for a cat to own a telescope—e.g., by inheritance from its former owner. Thus a cat with a telescope is not an inconsistent description. However, it must compete with other plausible interpretations like seeing with a telescope in I saw a cat with a telescope. Thus I assume that interpretations are computed in parallel, with the most plausible prediction being the one that ends up updating both E/S structure and the TF.</rawString>
