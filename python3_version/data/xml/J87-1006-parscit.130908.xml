TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE
SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT IN RESPECTIVE
COORDINATIONS AND CONTEXT-FREENESS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99934675">
Langendoen (1977) advanced an argument against
English being a context-free language involving cross-
serial subject-verb agreement in respectively constructions
such as (1).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.720024">
(1) The man and the women dances and sing,
respectively.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.950606677419355">
As noted by Pullum and Gazdar (1982), however, and
acknowledged subsequently by Langendoen (personal
communication), such examples are unacceptable, and
the argument collapses on empirical grounds.
However, at least some speakers reject examples like
(2) as well.
(2) The man and the women dance and sing,
respectively.
This fact leads directly to a demonstration that there is,
after all, a cross-serial dependency involving the gram-
matical number of subject NPs and verbs in respectively
constructions. However, it is not clear at present how
representative such speakers are, and so instead of
making claims about English in general, we will confine
them to just those varieties of the language that stigma-
tize examples like (2), which will be denoted as Engfishy
leaving to one side any varieties of which this may not be
true (English2).1
In Englishi, a verb that formally distinguishes singular
from plural, i.e., a non-auxiliary present tense verb,
cannot occur in a respectively construction if the corre-
sponding subject NP is singular. This cannot be
accounted for merely by barring marked singular verbs
from occurring in coordinate predicates of respectively
constructions. Such a move would correctly exclude
examples like (1), but it would allow sentences like (2),
with plural verbs corresponding to singular subjects.
Nor is it possible to simply bar singular subjects from
occurring in respectively constructions, since they are
perfectly possible provided the corresponding verb is
either a past tense, as in (3a), or an auxiliary, as in (3b).

(3) a. The man and the women danced and sing,
respectively.
b.The women and the man sing and can dance,
respectively.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.934964444444444">
This means that a singular subject can only co-occur
with a past tense or an auxiliary verb, whereas a plural
subject can take a non-auxiliary present tense verb as
well. The difference in the co-occurrence possibilities of
singular as opposed to plural subject NPs amounts to a
peculiar kind of number agreement.2 This fact leads
quite directly to a demonstration that English, is not
context free.3
Consider the regular set (4).

This is the set of all stringsÂ°. (only some of them gram-
matical in English) consisting of any number of occur-
rences in any order of the phrases the man and the
women, with an and between the last two, followed by
any number of occurrences in any order of the words
danced and sing, with an and between the last two,
followed by the word respectively.
According to what has been said, the intersection of

(5) f the man x and the women danced y and sing

a, (the women) = f danced, sing}1

<bodyText confidence="0.999879222222222">
This is the set of all those strings of (4) that meet the
additional condition that every occurrence of the man
must be matched by an occurrence of danced and every
occurrence of the women by an occurrence of either
danced or sing. This matching is achieved by defining the
substitution5 a, of the man to be the set {danced} and that
of the women to be the set fdanced, sing} and requiring y
to be equal to a, of x.
We now define a substitution a, such that

a2(the man) = al
G2(the woman) = {b
a2(danced) = {c1

(6) fa xbcyd I X E fa, b1+;
y = a3 E IC, d1+; a3(a) = c; 03(b) = fc, dl&amp;rbrc.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.912058">
We now intersect (6) with the regular set

to obtain (7).

The set in (7) can be shown trans-context-free by
pumping. Take the string z = akbkakckdkek (where k is
the constant of the pumping lemma). On the one hand,
if we pump only in the first or only in the second half of
the string, the resulting string will violate the condition
that n+m+I=k+j+i. On the other hand, since k

is the constant of the pumping lemma, the pumped
substring cannot be longer than k, and therefore the only
other place we might be able to pump would be in the
middle as and the middle cs. But this would result in
violating the condition that I may not be greater than i.
Thus, z cannot be pumped without violating the pumping
lemma, and hence (7) is not context free. Since
context-free languages are closed under intersection with
regular sets, it follows that (6) is not context-free either.
Since context-free languages are also closed under substi-
tution, this means that (5) is also not context-free. Final-
ly, since (5) is the intersection of English, with the
regular set (4), it follows that English, is not context-
free. Q.E.D.

be helpful, therefore, to point out that a substitution is a mapping
like a homomorphism except that it is usually denoted by a rather
than h and that it may associate each element in the vocabulary of a
language with a whole set (possibly infinite) of strings rather than
with just one string, as in the case of a homomorphism. In the pres-
ent case, we needed to employ a (slightly more general kind of)
substitution in order to be able to associate the women with sing as
well as danced. It should also be noted that, while the man and the
women are linguistically analyzable, we have for technical conven-
ience treated them as single elements of the terminal vocabulary in
defining the substitutions.

A NOTE ON A STUDY OF CASES
This note describes and illustrates a study of deep
cases using a large sample of sentences. The purpose
of the note is to draw attention to the value of the
source material used for those interested in case-
based representations of sentence meaning, and to
indicate the potential utility of the study results.
The purpose of this note is to draw attention to the utility
of a specific source of data relevant to the use of case-
based meaning representations in language processing, by
illustrating the way we have exploited this source.
Like many others, we have used a language analyser
that builds meaning representations expressing semantic
case roles; specifically, Boguraev&apos;s (1979) analyser builds
dependency trees with word senses defined by semantic
category primitive formulae, and with case labels, i.e.,
semantic relation primitives, on the constituents of verb
(and some other) structures.
Using the analyser for more varied and demanding
purposes than Boguraev&apos;s original tests (see, e.g., Bogu-
raev and Sparck Jones 1983) left us dissatisfied with the
original set of case relations. We therefore carried out a
detailed analysis of a large sample of English sentences
to evaluate our proposals for a better-founded and more
comprehensive set of case relations. This study exploited
F.T. Wood&apos;s &amp;quot;English prepositional idioms&amp;quot; (Wood
1967), which provides a careful account, supported by
extensive examples, of the uses of English prepositions
and preposition-like terms. For instance,

Our study was intended to establish both the justifica-
tion for each case relation individually, by reference to a
range of sentences, and the plausibility of the set of
relations as a whole, by reference to the complete set of
sentences. Looking at Wood&apos;s description of a preposi-
tion&apos;s sense, and its accompanying illustration(s), we
tried to assign a case label to the link between the
sentence elements made by the preposition which we felt
captured the essential nature of that link, at the level of
generality represented by a set of 20-30 cases. Thus
&amp;quot;location&amp;quot; would be the label associated with a number
of specific space-relation prepositions, e.g., above, at, by.
