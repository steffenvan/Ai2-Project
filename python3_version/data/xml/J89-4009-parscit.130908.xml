Handbooks of Linguistics and Communication Science, Volume 4)
The last 30 years have witnessed the emergence and growth of the discipline Computa-
tional Linguistics. This field, which is also known as linguistic data processing, language
data processing, natural language processing, and information linguistics, reflects the
interests of many different disciplines ranging from philology, linguistics, computer and
information science, psychology, and psycholinguistics.
Despite this diversity, the discipline does have a clearly definable subject matter: the in-
vestigation of language and language phenomena by using the computer as a research
tool. The Handbook aims to structure this relatively young discipline and to give as com-
prehensive a review as possible of its foundations, findings, and perspectives. The Hand-
book reflects the main binary division within the field of Computational Linguistics: (1)
the computer as a tool for describing linguistic phenomena and processing the empirical
data on which linguistic theories are based and; (2) the computer as a language user, as
an artificially &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; system that can thus be regarded as a simulation of natural
language processing systems. By considering both description and simulation side by side,
the Handbook presents this new discipline in its entirety and thus provides an orienta-
tion for individual researchers, teachers, and students in the field.
A bibliography of approximately 4,000 titles which are referred to in the articles completes
the volume.

This new quarterly from The MIT Press
is the first letters journal to provide an
interdisciplinary forum for the publication
of important research results in neuronal
modeling and computation.
Each issue of NEURAL COMPUTATION collects key information on new discov-
eries and guides the reader to sources for further details, making it easier to keep
current. Until now, scientists had to search among numerous, disparate journals to
find information on developments in the field. The journal includes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99984125">
• letters — research advances of general interest
• notes — brief announcements of technical results
• views — short essays that are accessible to all scientists
• reviews — significant advances in a general area
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7689990625">
NEURAL COMPUTATION provides a valuable overview of the broad range
of work contributing to the field. The disciplines covered include neuroscience,
psychology, physics, mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence.
&amp;quot;Understanding the brain is a challenge that is attracting a growing number of scien-
tists and engineers from many disciplines. NEURAL COMPUTATION will serve as a
crossroads where they can meet and exchange ideas.&amp;quot;

ACL 1990 DUES STATEMENT
Note LATE PAYMENT FEE for Renewals after 15 March; Institutions Subscribe through MIT Press
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981426">
Personal membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are paid.
Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored
conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Institutional memberships were discontinued in 1988 when MIT Press
began publishing the journal; instead, institutions should subscribe to the journal through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street,
Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; 617:253-2889. Back issues and proceedings are available only from the ACL Office, except that
institutions should backorder journals from 1988 on through MIT Press. An order form is on the other side of this statement. The
change in publishing required establishing a late payment for renewals made after 15 March, because of the extra mailing and
handling costs. The late payment fee does not apply to new members. Dues and back order payments can be made in Europe and
Japan as well as the U.S.; read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify your institutional affiliation if it
is not part of your address. Also please provide your telephone number and computer network address.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.918815">
Manuscripts to Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches,
or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with
an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.948054">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.910086952380952">
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in
computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the
particular subject area.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript
is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed
journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the
details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final
version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright
Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the
employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary
results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership.
Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical
correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contribu-
tions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:

<abstract confidence="0.956384333333333">tional Linguistics. This field, which is also known as linguistic data processing, language data processing, natural language processing, and information linguistics, reflects the interests of many different disciplines ranging from philology, linguistics, computer and information science, psychology, and psycholinguistics. Despite this diversity, the discipline does have a clearly definable subject matter: the investigation of language and language phenomena by using the computer as a research tool. The Handbook aims to structure this relatively young discipline and to give as comprehensive a review as possible of its foundations, findings, and perspectives. The Handbook reflects the main binary division within the field of Computational Linguistics: (1) the computer as a tool for describing linguistic phenomena and processing the empirical data on which linguistic theories are based and; (2) the computer as a language user, as an artificially &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; system that can thus be regarded as a simulation of natural language processing systems. By considering both description and simulation side by side, the Handbook presents this new discipline in its entirety and thus provides an orientation for individual researchers, teachers, and students in the field. A bibliography of approximately 4,000 titles which are referred to in the articles completes the volume. Price subject to change.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.986499625">to Linguistics should submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: This category includes contributions that report significant research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. CORRESPONDENCE: category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance. TO THE EDITOR: includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.</abstract>
