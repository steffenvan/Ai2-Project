Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999880555555556">
We present ConsentCanvas, a system
which structures and “texturizes” End-User
License Agreement (EULA) documents to
be more readable. The system aims to help
users better understand the terms under
which they are providing their informed
consent. ConsentCanvas receives unstruc-
tured text documents as input and uses un-
supervised natural language processing
methods to embellish the source document
using a linked stylesheet. Unlike similar
usable security projects which employ
summarization techniques, our system pre-
serves the contents of the source document,
minimizing the cognitive and legal burden
for both the end user and the licensor. Our
system does not require a corpus for train-
ing.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999631324324324">
Less than 2% of users read End-User License
Agreement (EULA) documents when indicating
their consent to the software installation process
(Good et al., 2007). While these documents often
serve as a user’s sole direct interaction with the
legal terms of the software, they are usually not
read, as they are presented in such a way as is di-
vorced from the use of the software itself (Fried-
man et al., 2005). To address this, Kay and Terry
(2010) developed what they call Textured Consent
agreements which employ a linked stylesheet to
augment salient parts of a EULA document. Unlike
summarization-driven approaches to usable securi-
ty, this is achieved without any modification of the
underlying text, minimizing the cognitive and legal
burden for both the end user and the licensor and
removing the need to make available a supplemen-
tary unmodified document (Kelley et al, 2009; Far-
zindar, 2004).
We have developed a system, ConsentCanvas, for
automating the creation of a Textured Consent
document from an unstructured EULA based on
the example XHTML/CSS template provided by
Kay and Terry (2010; Figure 1). Our system does
not currently use any complex syntactic or seman-
tic information from the source document. Instead,
it makes use of regular expressions and correlation
functions to identify variable-length relevant
phrases (Kim and Chan, 2004) to alter the docu-
ment’s structure and appearance.
We report on ConsentCanvas as a work in pro-
gress. The system automates the labour intensive
manual process used by Kay and Terry (2010).
ConsentCanvas has a working implementation, but
has not yet been formally evaluated. We also pre-
sent the first available implementation of Kim and
Chan’s algorithm (2004).

2 Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961916666667">
We built ConsentCanvas in Python 2.6 using the
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) 2.0b9. It uses a
modified version of the markup.py library availa-
ble from http://markup.sourceforge.net to generate
valid HTML5 documents. A detailed specification
of our system workflow is provided in Figure 2.
ConsentCanvas was designed with modularity as a
priority in order to adapt to the needs of future ex-
perimentation and improvement. As such, we con-
tribute not just a working application, but also an
extensible framework for the visual embellishment
of plaintext documents.

2.1 Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905888888889">
Our system takes plain-text EULA documents as
input through a simple command line interface. It
then passes this document to four independent
submodules for analysis. Each submodule stores
the initial and final character positions of a string
selected from within the document body, but does
not modify the document before reaching the ren-
derer step. This allows for easy extensibility of the
system

2.2 Variable-Length Phrase Finder
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990055555556">
The variable-length phrase finder module features
a Python implementation of the Variable-Length
Phrase Finding (VLPF) Algorithm by Kim and
Chan (2004). Kim and Chan’s algorithm was cho-
sen for its domain independence and adaptability,
as it can be fine-tuned to use different correlation
functions.
patterns of lexical co-occurrence and distribution
in order to impose topic boundaries on a document.
ConsentCanvas uses the NLTK implementation of
the TextTiling algorithm. Segmentation was not
applied to the entire document (doing this resulted
in a messy layout incoherent with structuring ap-
plied by headers and titles). Instead, we used it to
identify the lead paragraph of the document, which
was rendered differently using the “lead para-
graph” container in the template. Future versions
will use a more modern segmenting algorithm.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997243">
2.5 Header Extractor
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999504">
The header extractor module uses regular expres-
sions to match any section header-like text from
the original document. Several different search
strings were used to catch multiple potential header
types, including but not limited to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99763575">
• 8 OR FEWER ALL-CAPS TOKENS
• 3. Single level numbered headers
• 3.1 Multi-level numbered headers
• Eight or fewer tokens separated by a line break

2.6 Rendering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982285714286">
Each analysis submodule produces a list of charac-
ter positions where found items begin and end.
These are passed to our rendering system, which
inserts the corresponding HTML5 tags at the posi-
tions in original plaintext EULA. We append a
header to the output document to include the linked
stylesheet per HTML5 specifications.

3 Analysis &amp; Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984285714286">
We conducted a brief qualitative analysis on Con-
sentCanvas after implementation and debugging.
However, the problem space and system are not
yet ready for formal verification or experimenta-
tion. More exploration and refinement are required
before we will be able to empirically determine if
we have improved readability and comprehension.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994246">
3.1 Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998833333333">
We conducted our analysis on a small sample of
EULAs from the same collection used by Lavesson
et al. (2008) in their work on the classification of
EULAs. There were 1021 EULAs in this corpus
divided into 96 “bad” and 925 “good” examples.
We used the “good” examples for our analysis.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998602">
3.2 Variable-Length Phrase Finding Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996332">
Variable-Length Phrases (VLPs) were reasonably
effective. In several of the best examples of textur-
ized EULAs security concerns were highlighted; in
the texturized version of one document, the pull
quote was “on media, ICONIX, Inc. warrants that
such media is free from defects in materials and
workmanship under normal use for a period of
ninety (90) days from the date of purchase as evi-
denced by a copy of the receipt. ICONIX, Inc. war-
rants.” In the same EULA, other VLPs proved
helpful: “e that ICONIX, Inc. is free to use any
ideas, concepts,” “(except one copy for backup
purposes),” and “Inc. ICONIX, Inc. does not col-
lect any personally identifiable information regard-
ing senders.” Some phrases have incomplete words
at the beginning and end; this is an artifact of a
known but unfixed bug in the implementation, not
a result of the algorithm.
However, these results were mixed in other EU-
LAs. Several short but frequent phrases were found
to be VLPs, such as “Inc.,” in the same EULA. In
short licenses consisting of only one to three para-
graphs, sometimes no relevant VLPs were discov-
ered. There are also many phrases that should be
highlighted that are not.

3.3 Preliminary System Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908923076923">
We conducted an informal evaluation in which our
system applied texture to 15 documents chosen
from our corpus at random. Of these, five were
determined to be highly readable exemplar docu-
ments. An excerpt from one of these is shown in
Figure 4. Of the remaining ten documents, four had
poorly selected header markup but were otherwise
satisfactory, two were too short or poorly-
structured to benefit from the insertion of header
markup, two did not perform well on the VLPF
step, and two had several errors which appeared to
have been caused by the use of non-ASCII charac-
ters in the original document.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999508">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960714285714">
The pull quote text was nearly unintelligible in
almost all cases, due largely to the fact that it did
not split evenly on sentence borders. We did not let
this detract from our evaluation of the documents,
because performance in this area was so consist-
ently, and charmingly, poor, but did not affect
readability of the main document body.

4.1 Comparisons with Kay and Terry
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999787">
Kay and Terry (2010) make reference to “aug-
menting and embellishing” the document text –
specifically not altering the original content. How-
ever, their example document is written concisely
in a user-friendly voice dissimilar to most formal
EULAs found in the wild. Their work provides a
strong proof of concept, but a key line of investiga-
tion will be whether their approach is practical, or
whether some preprocessing is necessary to simpli-
fy content.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999331">
4.2 Handling Legal Language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963571428571">
We had anticipated a considerable amount of diffi-
culty in selecting meaningful phrases from diffi-
cult-to-understand legal language in the source
document. However, most documents were found
to contain a number of high-frequency VLPs with
both layperson-salient legal terminology and
common clues to document structure.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993843">
4.3 Future Work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929333333333">
ConsentCanvas is fully implemented but offers
many opportunities for improvement as the task
becomes better understood. The variable-length
phrase finding module only incorporates a single
correlation function. More will be added, drawing
in particular from those documented by Kim and
Chan (2004). Machine learning techniques might
also be used to classify phrases as relevant or not,
leading to better-emphasized content.
The rhythm of emphasized phrasing is also im-
portant. In the example license designed by Kay
and Terry (2010), there are one or two emphasized
phrases in each section. The phrases found by
ConsentCanvas are often sporadic, clustering in
some sections and absent from others. As a result
of this, readability suffers, and so we may need to
look into possible stratification of VLPs. This
might also aid multi-lingual documents, of which
there are a few examples (a cursory look showed
the results in French were comparable to those in
English in a bilingual EULA in our corpus).

Contact information is currently emphasized in the
same manner as salient phrases. We plan to even-
tually embed hyperlinks for all URLs and email
addresses found in the source document, as in Kay
and Terry (2010).
The segmenter module uses the basic TextTiling
algorithm with default parameters. More recent
approaches could be implemented and could act on
more than the lead paragraph. For example, coher-
ent sections of long EULAs might be identified
and presented as separate containers.
We plan to improve header extractor providing
more sophisticated regular expressions; we found
that a wide variety of header styles were used. In
particular, we plan to consider layouts that use dig-
its, punctuation, or inconsistent capitalization in
multiple instances in the document body.
There is currently no module that incorporates the
“Warning” box from Kay and Terry (2010). This
module would be designed to select relevant multi-
line blocks of text by using techniques similar to
the variable-length phrase finder or the segmenter.
ConsentCanvas will also be extended to support
command-line parameters. This will enable cus-
tomized texturing of EULAs and facilitate experi-
mentation for understanding and evaluating gains
in comprehension and readability. Finally, we will
conduct a formal user evaluation of ConsentCan-
vas.

ConsentCanvas will also be extended to support command-line parameters. This will enable customized texturing of EULAs and facilitate experimentation for understanding and evaluating gains in comprehension and readability. Finally, we will conduct a formal user evaluation of ConsentCanvas. 5 Conclusion We have provided a description of the work in progress for ConsentCanvas, a system for automatically adding texture to EULAs to improve r</context>

To address this, Kay and Terry (2010) developed what they call Textured Consent agreements which employ a linked stylesheet to augment salient parts of a EULA document. Unlike summarization-driven approaches to usable security, this is achieved without any modification of the underlying text, minimizing the cognitive and legal burden for both the end user and the licensor and removing the need to make available a supplementary unmodified document (Kelley et al, 2009; Farzindar, 2004). We have developed a system, ConsentCanvas, for automating the creation of a Textured Consent document from an unstructured EULA based on the example XHTML/CSS template provided by Kay and Terry (2010; Figure 1). Our system does not currently use any complex syntactic or semantic information from the source document. Instead, it makes use of regular expressions and correlation functions to identify variable-length relevant phrases (Kim and Chan, 2004) to alter the document’s structure and appearance.

ConsentCanvas has a working implementation, but has not yet been formally evaluated. We also present the first available implementation of Kim and Chan’s algorithm (2004). Figure 1.

It then passes this document to four independent submodules for analysis. Each submodule stores the initial and final character positions of a string selected from within the document body, but does not modify the document before reaching the renderer step. This allows for easy extensibility of the system 2.2 Variable-Length Phrase Finder The variable-length phrase finder module features a Python implementation of the Variable-Length Phrase Finding (VLPF) Algorithm by Kim and Chan (2004). Kim and Chan’s algorithm was chosen for its domain independence and adaptability, as it can be fine-tuned to use different correlation functions. patterns of lexical co-occurrence and distribution in order to impose topic boundaries on a document. ConsentCanvas uses the NLTK implementation of the TextTiling algorithm. Segmentation was not applied to the entire document (doing this resulted in a messy layout incoherent with structuring applied by headers and titles). Instead, we used it to identify the lead paragraph of the document, which was rendered differently using the “lead paragraph” c</context>

However, most documents were found to contain a number of high-frequency VLPs with both layperson-salient legal terminology and common clues to document structure. 4.3 Future Work ConsentCanvas is fully implemented but offers many opportunities for improvement as the task becomes better understood. The variable-length phrase finding module only incorporates a single correlation function. More will be added, drawing in particular from those documented by Kim and Chan (2004). Machine learning techniques might also be used to classify phrases as relevant or not, leading to better-emphasized content. The rhythm of emphasized phrasing is also important. In the example license designed by Kay and Terry (2010), there are one or two emphasized phrases in each section. The phrases found by ConsentCanvas are often sporadic, clustering in some sections and absent from others. As a result of this, readability suffers, and so we may need to look into possible stratification of VLPs. This might also aid multi-lingual documents, of which there are a few examples (a cursory lo</context>

We append a header to the output document to include the linked stylesheet per HTML5 specifications. 3 Analysis &amp; Results We conducted a brief qualitative analysis on ConsentCanvas after implementation and debugging. However, the problem space and system are not yet ready for formal verification or experimentation. More exploration and refinement are required before we will be able to empirically determine if we have improved readability and comprehension. 3.1 Corpus We conducted our analysis on a small sample of EULAs from the same collection used by Lavesson et al. (2008) in their work on the classification of EULAs. There were 1021 EULAs in this corpus divided into 96 “bad” and 925 “good” examples. We used the “good” examples for our analysis. 3.2 Variable-Length Phrase Finding Results Variable-Length Phrases (VLPs) were reasonably effective. In several of the best examples of texturized EULAs security concerns were highlighted; in the texturized version of one document, the pull quote was “on media, ICONIX, Inc. warrants that such media is free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of purcha</context>
