Work at the Unit for Computer Research
on the English Language at the
University of Lancaster has been directed
towards producing a grammatically
annotated version of the Lancaster-Oslo/
Bergen (LOB) Corpus of written British
English texts as the preliminary stage in
developing computer programs and data
files for providing a grammatical
analysis of unrestricted English text.
From 1981-83, a suite of PASCAL
programs was devised to automatically
produce a single level of grammatical
description with one word tag representing
the word class or part of speech of each
word token in the corpus. Error analysis
and subsequent modification to the system
resulted in over 96 per cent of word
tags being correctly assigned
automatically. The remaining 3 to 4 per
cent were corrected by human post-editors.
Work is now in progress to devise a
suite of programs to provide a
constituent analysis of the sentences in
the corpus. So far, sample sentences
have been automatically assigned phrase
and clause tags using a probabilistic
system similar to word tagging. It is
hoped that the entire corpus will
eventually be parsed.

THE LOB CORPUS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999584272727273">
The LOB Corpus (Johansson, Leech and
Goodluck, 1978) is a collection of 500
text samples, each containing about
2,000 word tokens of written British
English published in a single year (1961).
The 500 text samples fall into 15
different text categories representing
a variety of styles such as press
reporting, science fiction, scholarly and
scientific writing, romantic fiction and
religious writing. There are two main
sections: informative prose and imaginative
prose. The corpus contains just over 1
million word tokens in all.
Preparation of the LOB corpus in
machine readable form began at the
Department of Linguistics and Modern
English Language at the University of
Lancaster in the early 1970s under the
direction of G.N. Leech. Work was
transferred, in 1977, to the Department
of English at the University of Oslo,
Norway and the Norwegian Computing Centre
for the Humanities at Bergen. Assembly
of the corpus was completed in 1978.
The LOB Corpus was designed to be a
British English equivalent of the
Standard Corpus of Present-Day Edited
American English, for use with Digital
Computers, otherwise known as the Brown
Corpus (Kua&apos;era and Francis, 1964; Hauge
and Hof land, 1978). The year of
publication of all text samples (1961)
and the division into 15 text categories
is the same for both corpora for the
purposes of a systematic comparison of
British and American natural language and
for collaboration between researchers
at the various universities.
Word Tagging of the LOB Corpus.
The initial method devised for
automatic word tagging of the LOB corpus
can be represented by the following
simplified schematic diagram:

<bodyText confidence="0.999835647058824">
Sample texts from the corpus are
input to the tagging system which then
performs essentially two main tasks:
firstly, one or more potential tags and,
where appropriate, probability markers,
are assigned to each input word by a
look up procedure that matches the input
form against a list of full word forms,
or, by default, against a list of one to
five word final characters, known as the
&apos;suffixlist&apos;; subsequently, in cases
where more than one potential tag has
been assigned, the most probable tag is
selected by using a matrix of ane-step
transition probabilities giving the
likelihood of one word tag following
another (Marshall, 1983: 141ff).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997982">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999781426829268">
The tag selection procedure
disambiguates the word class membership
of many common English words (such as
CONTACT, SHOW, TALK, TELEPHONE, WATCH and
WHISPER). Moreover, the method is
suitable for disambiguating strings of
adjacent ambiguities by calculating the
most likely path through a sequence of
alternative ane-step transition
probabilities.
Error analysis of the method (Marshall,
op. cit.: 143) showed that the system was
over 93 per cent successful in assigning
and selecting the appropriate tag in
tests an the running text of the LOB
corpus. But it became clear that this
figure could be improved by retagging
problematic sequences of words prior to
word tag disambiguation and, in addition,
by altering the probability weightings of
a small set of sequences of three tags,
known as &apos;tag triples&apos; (Marshall, op.
cit.: 147). In this Way, the system
makes use of a few heuristic procedures
in addition to the one-step probability
method to automatically annotate the input
text.
We have recently devised an interactive
version of the word tagging system so that
users may type in test sentences at a
terminal to obtain tagged sentences in
response. Additionally, we are
substantially extending and modifying the
word tag set. The programs and data files
used for automatic word tagging are being
modified to reduce manual intervention
and to provide more detailed sUbcategor-
izations.
Phrase and Clause Tagging.
The success of the probabilistic model
for word tagging prompted us to devise
a similar system for providing a
constituent analysis. Input to the
constituent analysis module of the system
is at present taken to be LOB text with
post-edited word tags, the output from
the word tagging system. We envisage
an interactive system for the future.
A separate set of phrase and clause
tags, known as the hypertag set, has been
devised for this purpose. A hypertag
consists of a single capital letter
indicating a general phrase or clause
category, such as &apos;N&apos; for noun phrase or
&apos;F&apos; for finite verb clause. This
initial capital letter may be followed
by one or more lower-case letters
representing subcategories within the
general hypertag class. For instance,
&apos;Na&apos; is a noun phrase with a subject
pronoun head, &apos;Vzb&apos; is a verb phrase with
the first word in the phrase inflected
as a third person singular form and the
last word being a form of the verb BE.
Strict rules an the permissible:
combinations of subcategory symbols have
been formulated in a Case Law Manual
(Sampson, 1984) which provides the rules
and symbols for checking the output of
the automatic constituent analysis. The
detailed distinctions made by the
subcategory symbols are devised with the
aim of providing helpful information for
automatic constituent analysis and, for
the time being, many subcategory symbols
are not included in the output of the
present system. (For the current set of
hypertags and subcategory symbols, see
Appendix A).
The procedures for parsing the corpus
may be represented in the following
simplified schematic diagram:
</bodyText>

WORD TAGGED CORPUS T-TAG ASSIGNMENT
(PARTIAL PARSE) BRACKET CLOSING AND
T-TAG SFTN,CTION CONSTITUENT ANALYSIS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934775">
Phrasal and clausal categories and
boundaries are assigned on the basis of
the likelihood of word tag pairs opening,
closing or continuing phrasal and clausal
constituencies. This first part of the
parsing procedure is known as T-tag
assignment. A table of word tag pairs
(with, in some cases, default values) is
used to assign a string of symbols, known
as a T-tag, representing parts of the
constituent structure of each sentence.
The word tag pair input stage of parsing
resembles the word- or suffixlist look up
stage in the word tagging system.
Subsequently, the most likely string of
T-tags, representing the most probable
parse, is selected by using statistical
data giving the likelihood of the
immediate dominance relations of
constituents. Other procedures, which I
will deal with later, are incorporated
into the system, but, in very broad
outline, the automatic constituent
analysis system resembles word tagging
in that potential categories (and
boundaries) are first assigned and later
disambiguated by calculating the most
likely path through the alternative
choices.
In the case of word tagging, the word
tagged Brown corpus enabled us to derive
word tag adjacency statistics for
potential word tag disambiguation. But
no parsed corpus exists yet for the
purposes of deriving statistics for
disambiguating parsing information.
A sample databank of constituent
structures has therefore been manually
compiled for initial trials of T-tag
assignment and disambiguation.

The Tree Bank
When the original set of hypertags and
rules was devised, G.R. Sampson began the
task of drawing tree diagrams of the
constituent analysis of sample sentences
an computer print-outs of the word tagged
version of the corpus. As tree drawing
proceeded, amendments and extensions to
the rules for tree drawing and the
inventory of hypertags were proposed, an
the basis of problems encountered by the
linguist in providing a satisfactory
grammatical analysis of the constructions
in the corpus. The rationale for the
original set of rules and symbols, and
of subsequent modifications, is documented
in a set of Tree Notes (Sampson, 1983 - ).
So far, about 1,500 complete sentences
have been manually parsed according to the
rules described in the Case Law Manual
and these structures have been keyed into
an ICL VME 2900 machine which represents
them in bracketed notation as four fields
of data an each record of a serial file.
The fields or columns of data are:- (1)
a reference number, (2) a word token of
sample text, (3) the word tag for the
word and (4) a field of hypertags and
brackets showing the constituency-level
status of each word token.
Any amendments to the rules and symbols
for hypertagging necessitate corresponding
amendments to the tree structures in the
tree databank.
The Case Law Manual.
The Case Law Manual (Sampson, 1984) is
a document that summarizes the rules and
symbols for tree drawing as they were
originally decided and subsequently
modified after problems encountered by the
linguist in working through samples of
the word tagged corpus. I will only give
a brief sketch of the principles contained
in the Case Law Manual in this paper.
Any sequence in the word tagged corpus
marked as a sentence is given a root
hypertag, &apos;S&apos;. Between &apos;S&apos; and the word
tag level of analysis, all constituents
perceived by the linguist to be
consisting of more than one word and, in
some cases, single word constituents,
are labelled with the appropriate
hypertag. Any clause or sentence tag
must dominate at least one phrase tag
but otherwise unary branching is generally
avoided.
Form takes precedence over function
so that, for instance, in fact is
labelled as a prepositianirParase rather
than as an adverbial phrase. No attempt
is made to show any paraphrase
relationships. Putative deleted or
transposed elements are, in general, not
referred to in the Case Law Manual, the
exceptions to this general principle
being in the treatment of some co-
ordinated constructions and in the
analysis of constructions involving what
transformational grammarians call
unbounded movement rules (Sampson, 1984:
2).
The sentences in the LOB corpus present
the linguist with the enormously rich
variety of English syntactic constructions
that occurs in newspapers, books and
journals; and they also force issues -
such as how to incorporate punctuation
into the parsing scheme, how to deal with
numbered lists and dates in brackets -
issues which, although present and
familiar in ordinary written language,
are not generally, if at all, accounted
for in current formalized grammars.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.950449" genericHeader="method">
T-TAG ASSIGNMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999713454545455">
A T-tag is part of the constituent
structure immediately dominating a
word tag pair, together with any
closures of constituents that have been
opened, and left unclosed, by previous
word tag pairs. Originally, it was
decided to start the parsing process by
using a table of all the possible
combinations of word tag pairs, each with
its awn T-tag output. Rules of this
sort may be exemplified as follows:-
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.79884575">
(N) CS -fl=YP
(N+1) VBN - JJ : V3EJ : T2CN
(11+2) - RB J : &apos;NCR
(11+3) VBG - RP . I N : Tr-R
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995345">
A word tag pair, to the left of the
equals sign, is accepted as the input
to the rule which, by look-up, assigns
a T-tag or string of T-tag options
(separated by colons) as alternative
possible analyses for the input tag pair.
In example (N), a subordinating
conjunction followed by a preposition
indicates that a prepositional phrase
is to be opened as daughter of the
previous constituent (denoted by the
&apos;wild card&apos; hypertag &amp;quot;T&apos;); in example
(11+1), a past participle form of a verb
followed by an adjective indicates
three options:
a. either close a previously opened
adjective phrase and continue an
already opened noun phrase or
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991879">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.993282366666667">
b. close a previously opened verb
phrase and open an adjective
phrase or
c. close a previously opened verb
phrase and open a noun phrase
constituent.
In this way, the constituent analysis
begins by an examination of the
immediately local context and a
considerable proportion of information
about correct parsing structure is
Obtained by considering the sequence of
adjacent word tag pairs in the input
string. In some cases, surplus inform-
ation is supplied about hypertag choices
which later has to be discarded by T-tag
selection; in other cases, word tag
pairs do not provide sufficient clues for
appropriate constituent boundary
assignment. Word tag pair input should
therefore be thought of as producing an
incomplete tree structure with surplus
alternative paths, the remaining task
being to complete the parse by filling in
the gaps and selecting the appropriate
path where more than one has been
assigned.
Cover Symbols.
For the purposes of T-tag look up,
word tag categories have been conflated
where it is considered unnecessary to
match the input against distinct word
tags; often, the initial part of a
T-tag closes the previous constituent,
whatever the identity of the constituent
is, and specification of rules for every
distinct pair of word tags is redundant.
This prevents T-tag assignment requiring
an unwieldy 133 * 133 matrix.
The more general word tag categories
are known as cover symbols. These
usually contain part of a word tag
string of characters with an asterisk
replacing symbols denoting the redundant
subclassifications. (See Appendix B for
a list of cover symbols.)
Three stages of T-tag assignment.
T-tag assignment is now divided into
three look-up procedures: (1) pairs of
word tags (2) pairs of cover symbols
(3) single word tags or cover symbols,
preceded or followed by an unspecified
tag. Each procedure operates in an
order designed to deal with exceptional
cases first and most general cases last.
For instance, if no rules in (1) and (2)
are invoked by an input pair of tags,
where the second input tag denotes some
form of verb, then the default rule -
TB . Y3ET is invoked such that any tag
followed by any form of verb closes
the constituent left open by a previous
T-tag look-up rule (where &apos;T&apos; is a symbol
denoting any hypertag). Subsequently,
a verb phrase is opened.
If the first tag of the input pair
denotes a form of the verb BE, then the
rule BE - TB = 1 T in procedure (2) is
invoked. Finally, if the first tag of
the input pair is &apos;JJR&apos;, denoting a
comparative adjective, and the second
tag is &apos;YBN&apos;, denoting the past
participle form of a verb, then the rule
JJR - YBN = I J in (1) is invoked.
The T-tag table was initially
constructed by linguistic intuition and
subsequently keyed into the ICL TME 2900
machine. Comparison of results with
sections of samples from the tree bank
enables a more empirical validation of
the entries by checking the output of the
T-tag look up procedure against samples
of the corpus that have been manually
parsed according to the rules contained
in the Case Law Manual.
Where alternative T-tags are assigned
for any word or cover tag pair, the
options are entered in order of
probability and unlikely options are
marked with the token &apos;W. This
information can be used for adjusting
probability weightings downwards in
comparison of alternative paths through
potential parse trees.
Reducing T-tag options.
Some procedures are incorporated into
T-tag assignment which serve to reduce
the explosive combinatorial possibilities
of a long partial parse with several
T-tag options. Sometimes, T-tag options
can be discarded immediately after T-tag
assignment because adjacent T-tag
information is incompatible; a T-tag
that closes a constituency level that
has not previously been opened is not a
viable alternative. In cases where
adjacent T-tags are compatible, the
assignment program collapses common
elements at either end of the options
and.the optional elements are enclosed
within curly brackets, separated by
one or more colons. Here is the
representation in cover symbols and
alternative constituent structures of the
sentence, &amp;quot;Their offering last night
differed little from their earlier act
on this show a week or so ago.&amp;quot; (LOB
reference: CO 4 80 001 - 81 081). Cover
symbols and word tags appear in angle
brackets:

<bodyText confidence="0.999884962962963">
Gaps in the analysis.
Since the T-tag selection phase of the
system does not insert constituents, it
follows that any gaps in the analysis
produced by T-tag look up must be filled
before the T-tag selection stage. By
intuition or by checking the output of
T-tag assignment against the same samples
contained in the tree bank, rules have
been incorporated into T-tag assignment
to insert additional T-tag data after
look up but before probability analysis.
When T-tag look up produces EPCN3
(open prepositional phrase, open and close
noun phrase), a further rule is
incorporated that closes the prepositional
phrase immediately after the noun phrase.
Similarly, a preposition tag followed by
a wh-determiner (e.g. with wham, to which,
12z whatever, etc) indicates that a farEw
-clause should be opened between the
previous two word tags (whatever precedes
the preposition and the preposition
itself).
Rules of this sort, which we call
&amp;quot;heuristic rules&amp;quot;, could be dealt with by
including extra entries in the T-tag
look up table, but since the constituency
status is more clearly indicated by
sequences of more than two tags, it is
considered appropriate, at this stage, to
include a few rules to overwrite the
output from T.-tag look up, in the same way
that heuristics such as &apos;tag triples&apos;
and a procedure for adjusting probability
weightings were included in the word
tagging system, prior to word tag
selection, to deal with awkward cases
there.
Long distance dependencies.
Genitive phrases and co-ordinated
constructions are particularly problematic.
For instance, in The 041bEieen of Eftgland&apos;s
Palace, T-tag looR-Up is not, at present,
able toestablish that a potential
genitive phrase has been encountered
until the apostrophe is reached. We
know that a genitive constituent might be
closed according to whether the potential
genitival constituent contains more than
one word. Consequently a procedure must
be built in to establish where the genitive
constituent should be opened, if at all.
Co-ordinated constructions present similar
problems.
backwards through the T-tag string,
selecting unclosed constituents,
constructing possible subtrees and
assigning each a probability, using
immediate dominance probability
statistics. Each of the possible closing
structures is incorporated into the
calculation for the next unclosed
constituent; the bracket closing procedure
works its way up and down constituency
levels until the root node, &apos;S&apos;, has
been reached and the most probable
analysis calculated.
T-tag options are treated in a similar
manner to bracket closing; probabilities
are calculated for the alternative
structures and the most likely one is
selected.
Immediate dominance probabilities.
A program has been devised to record
the distinct immediate dominance
relationships in the tree bank for each
hypertag; the number of permissible
sequences of hypertags or word tags that
any hypertag can dominate is stored in a
statistics file. At initial trials,
this was the databank used for selecting
the most likely parse, but because the
tree bank was not sufficiently large
enough to provide the appropriate analysis
for structures that, by chance, were not
yet included in the tree bank, other
methods for calculating probabilities were
tried out.
At present, daughter sequences are
split into consecutive pairs and the
probability of a particular option is
calculated by multiplying probabilities
of pairs of daughter constituents for
each subtree. This method prevents
sequences not accounted for in the tree
bank from being rejected. Sample
sentences have been successfully parsed
using this method, but we acknowledge that
further work is required. One problem
created by the method is that, because
probabilities are multiplied, there is a
bias against long strings. It is
envisaged that normalization factors,
which would take account of the depth of
the tree, would counterbalance the
distortion created by multiplication of
probabilities.

<abstract confidence="0.96086041509434">ABSIIRACT Work at the Unit for Computer Research on the English Language at the University of Lancaster has been directed towards producing a grammatically annotated version of the Lancaster-Oslo/ Bergen (LOB) Corpus of written British English texts as the preliminary stage in developing computer programs and data files for providing a grammatical analysis of unrestricted English text. From 1981-83, a suite of PASCAL programs was devised to automatically produce a single level of grammatical description with one word tag representing the word class or part of speech of each word token in the corpus. Error analysis and subsequent modification to the system resulted in over 96 per cent of word tags being correctly assigned The remaining 4 cent were corrected by human post-editors. Work is now in progress to devise a suite of programs to provide a the sentences in the corpus. So far, sample sentences have been automatically assigned phrase and clause tags using a probabilistic system similar to word tagging. It is hoped that the entire corpus will eventually be parsed. THE LOB CORPUS The LOB Corpus (Johansson, Leech and Goodluck, 1978) is a collection of 500 text samples, each containing about tokens of written British English published in a single year (1961). The 500 text samples fall into 15 different text categories representing a variety of styles such as press reporting, science fiction, scholarly and scientific writing, romantic fiction and religious writing. There are two main sections: informative prose and imaginative prose. The corpus contains just over 1 million word tokens in all. Preparation of the LOB corpus in machine readable form began at the Department of Linguistics and Modern English Language at the University of Lancaster in the early 1970s under the direction of G.N. Leech. Work was in the Department</abstract>

<note confidence="0.559558625">Humanities at Bergen. Assembly of the corpus was completed in 1978. The LOB Corpus was designed to be a British English equivalent of the Standard Corpus of Present-Day Edited American English, for use with Digital Computers, otherwise known as the Brown Corpus (Kua&apos;era and Francis, 1964; Hauge</note>
<abstract confidence="0.997876091575093">and Hof land, 1978). The year of publication of all text samples (1961) and the division into 15 text categories is the same for both corpora for the purposes of a systematic comparison of British and American natural language and between researchers at the various universities. Word Tagging of the LOB Corpus. The initial method devised for automatic word tagging of the LOB corpus can be represented by the following simplified schematic diagram: WORD FORMS -* 20TENTIAL WORD TAG ASSIGNMENT (for each word in isolation) TAG SELECTION (of words in context) -.4 TAGGED WORD FORMS Sample texts from the corpus are input to the tagging system which then performs essentially two main tasks: firstly, one or more potential tags and, where appropriate, probability markers, are assigned to each input word by a look up procedure that matches the input form against a list of full word forms, or, by default, against a list of one to five word final characters, known as the &apos;suffixlist&apos;; subsequently, in cases where more than one potential tag has been assigned, the most probable tag is selected by using a matrix of ane-step transition probabilities giving the likelihood of one word tag following another (Marshall, 1983: 141ff). 159 The tag selection procedure disambiguates the word class membership of many common English words (such as CONTACT, SHOW, TALK, TELEPHONE, WATCH and WHISPER). Moreover, the method is suitable for disambiguating strings of adjacent ambiguities by calculating the most likely path through a sequence of alternative ane-step transition probabilities. Error analysis of the method (Marshall, op. cit.: 143) showed that the system was over 93 per cent successful in assigning and selecting the appropriate tag in tests an the running text of the LOB corpus. But it became clear that this figure could be improved by retagging problematic sequences of words prior to word tag disambiguation and, in addition, by altering the probability weightings of a small set of sequences of three tags, known as &apos;tag triples&apos; (Marshall, op. 147). In this system makes use of a few heuristic procedures in addition to the one-step probability method to automatically annotate the input text. We have recently devised an interactive version of the word tagging system so that users may type in test sentences at a terminal to obtain tagged sentences in response. Additionally, we are substantially extending and modifying the word tag set. The programs and data files used for automatic word tagging are being modified to reduce manual intervention and to provide more detailed sUbcategorizations. Phrase and Clause Tagging. The success of the probabilistic model for word tagging prompted us to devise a similar system for providing a constituent analysis. Input to the constituent analysis module of the system is at present taken to be LOB text with post-edited word tags, the output from the word tagging system. We envisage an interactive system for the future. A separate set of phrase and clause tags, known as the hypertag set, has been devised for this purpose. A hypertag consists of a single capital letter indicating a general phrase or clause category, such as &apos;N&apos; for noun phrase or &apos;F&apos; for finite verb clause. This initial capital letter may be followed by one or more lower-case letters representing subcategories within the general hypertag class. For instance, &apos;Na&apos; is a noun phrase with a subject pronoun head, &apos;Vzb&apos; is a verb phrase with the first word in the phrase inflected as a third person singular form and the last word being a form of the verb BE. Strict rules an the permissible: combinations of subcategory symbols have been formulated in a Case Law Manual (Sampson, 1984) which provides the rules and symbols for checking the output of the automatic constituent analysis. The detailed distinctions made by the subcategory symbols are devised with the aim of providing helpful information for automatic constituent analysis and, for the time being, many subcategory symbols are not included in the output of the present system. (For the current set of hypertags and subcategory symbols, see Appendix A). The procedures for parsing the corpus may be represented in the following simplified schematic diagram: WORD TAGGED CORPUS T-TAG ASSIGNMENT (PARTIAL PARSE) BRACKET CLOSING AND T-TAG SFTN,CTION CONSTITUENT ANALYSIS Phrasal and clausal categories and boundaries are assigned on the basis of the likelihood of word tag pairs opening, closing or continuing phrasal and clausal constituencies. This first part of the parsing procedure is known as T-tag assignment. A table of word tag pairs (with, in some cases, default values) is used to assign a string of symbols, known as a T-tag, representing parts of the constituent structure of each sentence. The word tag pair input stage of parsing resembles the wordor suffixlist look up stage in the word tagging system. Subsequently, the most likely string of T-tags, representing the most probable parse, is selected by using statistical data giving the likelihood of the immediate dominance relations of constituents. Other procedures, which I will deal with later, are incorporated into the system, but, in very broad outline, the automatic constituent analysis system resembles word tagging in that potential categories (and boundaries) are first assigned and later disambiguated by calculating the most likely path through the alternative choices. In the case of word tagging, the word tagged Brown corpus enabled us to derive word tag adjacency statistics for potential word tag disambiguation. But no parsed corpus exists yet for the purposes of deriving statistics for disambiguating parsing information. A sample databank of constituent structures has therefore been manually compiled for initial trials of T-tag assignment and disambiguation. 160 The Tree Bank When the original set of hypertags and rules was devised, G.R. Sampson began the task of drawing tree diagrams of the constituent analysis of sample sentences an computer print-outs of the word tagged version of the corpus. As tree drawing proceeded, amendments and extensions to the rules for tree drawing and the inventory of hypertags were proposed, an the basis of problems encountered by the linguist in providing a satisfactory grammatical analysis of the constructions in the corpus. The rationale for the original set of rules and symbols, and of subsequent modifications, is documented in a set of Tree Notes (Sampson, 1983 - ). So far, about 1,500 complete sentences have been manually parsed according to the rules described in the Case Law Manual and these structures have been keyed into an ICL VME 2900 machine which represents them in bracketed notation as four fields of data an each record of a serial file. The fields or columns of data are:- (1) a reference number, (2) a word token of sample text, (3) the word tag for the word and (4) a field of hypertags and brackets showing the constituency-level status of each word token. Any amendments to the rules and symbols for hypertagging necessitate corresponding amendments to the tree structures in the tree databank. The Case Law Manual. The Case Law Manual (Sampson, 1984) is a document that summarizes the rules and symbols for tree drawing as they were originally decided and subsequently modified after problems encountered by the linguist in working through samples of the word tagged corpus. I will only give a brief sketch of the principles contained in the Case Law Manual in this paper. Any sequence in the word tagged corpus marked as a sentence is given a root hypertag, &apos;S&apos;. Between &apos;S&apos; and the word tag level of analysis, all constituents perceived by the linguist to be consisting of more than one word and, in some cases, single word constituents, are labelled with the appropriate hypertag. Any clause or sentence tag must dominate at least one phrase tag but otherwise unary branching is generally avoided. Form takes precedence over function so that, for instance, in fact is labelled as a prepositianirParase rather than as an adverbial phrase. No attempt is made to show any paraphrase relationships. Putative deleted or transposed elements are, in general, not referred to in the Case Law Manual, the exceptions to this general principle being in the treatment of some coordinated constructions and in the analysis of constructions involving what transformational grammarians call unbounded movement rules (Sampson, 1984: 2). The sentences in the LOB corpus present the linguist with the enormously rich variety of English syntactic constructions that occurs in newspapers, books and journals; and they also force issues such as how to incorporate punctuation into the parsing scheme, how to deal with numbered lists and dates in brackets issues which, although present and familiar in ordinary written language, are not generally, if at all, accounted for in current formalized grammars. T-TAG ASSIGNMENT A T-tag is part of the constituent structure immediately dominating a word tag pair, together with any closures of constituents that have been opened, and left unclosed, by previous word tag pairs. Originally, it was decided to start the parsing process by using a table of all the possible combinations of word tag pairs, each with its awn T-tag output. Rules of this may be exemplified as follows:- (N) CS -fl=YP (N+1) VBN - JJ : V3EJ : T2CN (11+2) - RB J : &apos;NCR (11+3) VBG - RP . I N : Tr-R A word tag pair, to the left of the equals sign, is accepted as the input to the rule which, by look-up, assigns a T-tag or string of T-tag options (separated by colons) as alternative possible analyses for the input tag pair. In example (N), a subordinating conjunction followed by a preposition indicates that a prepositional phrase is to be opened as daughter of the previous constituent (denoted by the &apos;wild card&apos; hypertag &amp;quot;T&apos;); in example (11+1), a past participle form of a verb followed by an adjective indicates three options: a. either close a previously opened adjective phrase and continue an already opened noun phrase or 161 b. close a previously opened verb phrase and open an adjective phrase or c. close a previously opened verb phrase and open a noun phrase constituent. In this way, the constituent analysis begins by an examination of the immediately local context and a considerable proportion of information about correct parsing structure is Obtained by considering the sequence of adjacent word tag pairs in the input string. In some cases, surplus information is supplied about hypertag choices which later has to be discarded by T-tag selection; in other cases, word tag pairs do not provide sufficient clues for appropriate constituent boundary assignment. Word tag pair input should therefore be thought of as producing an incomplete tree structure with surplus alternative paths, the remaining task being to complete the parse by filling in the gaps and selecting the appropriate path where more than one has been assigned. Cover Symbols. For the purposes of T-tag look up, word tag categories have been conflated where it is considered unnecessary to match the input against distinct word tags; often, the initial part of a T-tag closes the previous constituent, whatever the identity of the constituent is, and specification of rules for every distinct pair of word tags is redundant. This prevents T-tag assignment requiring an unwieldy 133 * 133 matrix. The more general word tag categories are known as cover symbols. These usually contain part of a word tag string of characters with an asterisk replacing symbols denoting the redundant subclassifications. (See Appendix B for a list of cover symbols.) Three stages of T-tag assignment. T-tag assignment is now divided into three look-up procedures: (1) pairs of word tags (2) pairs of cover symbols (3) single word tags or cover symbols, preceded or followed by an unspecified tag. Each procedure operates in an order designed to deal with exceptional cases first and most general cases last. For instance, if no rules in (1) and (2) are invoked by an input pair of tags, where the second input tag denotes some form of verb, then the default rule - TB . Y3ET is invoked such that any tag followed by any form of verb closes the constituent left open by a previous T-tag look-up rule (where &apos;T&apos; is a symbol denoting any hypertag). Subsequently, a verb phrase is opened. If the first tag of the input pair denotes a form of the verb BE, then the rule BE - TB = 1 T in procedure (2) is invoked. Finally, if the first tag of the input pair is &apos;JJR&apos;, denoting a comparative adjective, and the second tag is &apos;YBN&apos;, denoting the past participle form of a verb, then the rule JJR - YBN = I J in (1) is invoked. The T-tag table was initially constructed by linguistic intuition and subsequently keyed into the ICL TME 2900 machine. Comparison of results with sections of samples from the tree bank enables a more empirical validation of the entries by checking the output of the T-tag look up procedure against samples of the corpus that have been manually parsed according to the rules contained in the Case Law Manual. Where alternative T-tags are assigned for any word or cover tag pair, the options are entered in order of probability and unlikely options are marked with the token &apos;W. This information can be used for adjusting probability weightings downwards in comparison of alternative paths through potential parse trees. Reducing T-tag options. Some procedures are incorporated into T-tag assignment which serve to reduce the explosive combinatorial possibilities of a long partial parse with several T-tag options. Sometimes, T-tag options can be discarded immediately after T-tag assignment because adjacent T-tag information is incompatible; a T-tag that closes a constituency level that has not previously been opened is not a viable alternative. In cases where adjacent T-tags are compatible, the assignment program collapses common elements at either end of the options optional elements are enclosed within curly brackets, separated by one or more colons. Here is the representation in cover symbols and alternative constituent structures of the sentence, &amp;quot;Their offering last night differed little from their earlier act on this show a week or so ago.&amp;quot; (LOB reference: CO 4 80 001 - 81 081). Cover symbols and word tags appear in angle brackets: SCN&lt;DT*.&gt;N&lt;N*&gt;DIN&lt;AP*&gt;11:N*&gt;n R&lt;R*). : 3 ] : [J&lt;R*&gt; * &gt;: 162 Gaps in the analysis. Since the T-tag selection phase of the system does not insert constituents, it follows that any gaps in the analysis produced by T-tag look up must be filled before the T-tag selection stage. By intuition or by checking the output of T-tag assignment against the same samples contained in the tree bank, rules have been incorporated into T-tag assignment to insert additional T-tag data after look up but before probability analysis. When T-tag look up produces EPCN3 (open prepositional phrase, open and close noun phrase), a further rule is incorporated that closes the prepositional phrase immediately after the noun phrase. Similarly, a preposition tag followed by a wh-determiner (e.g. with wham, to which, whatever,etc) that should be opened between the previous two word tags (whatever precedes the preposition and the preposition itself). Rules of this sort, which we call &amp;quot;heuristic rules&amp;quot;, could be dealt with by including extra entries in the T-tag look up table, but since the constituency status is more clearly indicated by of more than two it is considered appropriate, at this stage, to include a few rules to overwrite the from up, in the same way that heuristics such as &apos;tag triples&apos; and a procedure for adjusting probability weightings were included in the word tagging system, prior to word tag selection, to deal with awkward cases there. Long distance dependencies. Genitive phrases and co-ordinated constructions are particularly problematic. instance, in The 041bEieenof T-tag is not, at present, that a potential genitive phrase has been encountered until the apostrophe is reached. We know that a genitive constituent might be closed according to whether the potential genitival constituent contains more than one word. Consequently a procedure must be built in to establish where the genitive constituent should be opened, if at all. Co-ordinated constructions present similar problems. backwards through the T-tag string, selecting unclosed constituents, constructing possible subtrees and assigning each a probability, using immediate dominance probability statistics. Each of the possible closing into the calculation for the next unclosed constituent; the bracket closing procedure works its way up and down constituency levels until the root node, &apos;S&apos;, has been reached and the most probable analysis calculated. T-tag options are treated in a similar manner to bracket closing; probabilities are calculated for the alternative structures and the most likely one is selected. Immediate dominance probabilities. A program has been devised to record the distinct immediate dominance relationships in the tree bank for each hypertag; the number of permissible of hypertags or word tags any hypertag can dominate is stored in a statistics file. At initial trials, this was the databank used for selecting the most likely parse, but because the tree bank was not sufficiently large enough to provide the appropriate analysis for structures that, by chance, were not yet included in the tree bank, other methods for calculating probabilities were tried out. At present, daughter sequences are split into consecutive pairs and the a particular option is calculated by multiplying probabilities of pairs of daughter constituents for each subtree. This method prevents sequences not accounted for in the tree bank from being rejected. Sample sentences have been successfully parsed using this method, but we acknowledge that further work is required. One problem created by the method is that, because probabilities are multiplied, there is a bias against long strings. It is envisaged that normalization factors, which would take account of the depth of the tree, would counterbalance the distortion created by multiplication of probabilities. CONCLUSION T-TAG SPLECTION AND BRACKET CLOSING task of the final phase of the parser to fill in any remaining in the appropriate and calculate the most probable tree structure given the various T-tag options. The bracket closing procedure works We have found that the success rate for grammatically annotating the LOB corpus using probabilistic techniques for lexical disambiguation is surprisingly high and we have consequently endeavoured to apply similar techniques to provide a constituent analysis. 163 Corpus data provides us with the rich variety of extant English constructions. that are the real test of the grammarian&apos;s and the computer programmer&apos;s skill in devising an automatic parsing system. The present method provides an analysis, albeit a fallible one, for any input sentence and therefore the success rate of the tagging scheme can be assessed and where appropriate, improved.

Moreover, the method is suitable for disambiguating strings of adjacent ambiguities by calculating the most likely path through a sequence of alternative ane-step transition probabilities. Error analysis of the method (Marshall, op. cit.: 143) showed that the system was over 93 per cent successful in assigning and selecting the appropriate tag in tests an the running text of the LOB corpus. But it became clear that this figu</context>

This initial capital letter may be followed by one or more lower-case letters representing subcategories within the general hypertag class. For instance, &apos;Na&apos; is a noun phrase with a subject pronoun head, &apos;Vzb&apos; is a verb phrase with the first word in the phrase inflected as a third person singular form and the last word being a form of the verb BE. Strict rules an the permissible: combinations of subcategory symbols have been formulated in a Case Law Manual (Sampson, 1984) which provides the rules and symbols for checking the output of the automatic constituent analysis. The detailed distinctions made by the subcategory symbols are devised with the aim of providing helpful information for automatic constituent analysis and, for the time being, many subcategory symbols are not included in the output of the present system. (For the current set of hypertags and subcategory symbols, see Appendix A). The procedures for parsing the corpus may be represented in the following simplified schematic diagram: WORD TAGGED CORPUS T-TAG ASSIGNMENT (PARTIAL PARSE) BRACKET CLOS</context>

The fields or columns of data are:- (1) a reference number, (2) a word token of sample text, (3) the word tag for the word and (4) a field of hypertags and brackets showing the constituency-level status of each word token. Any amendments to the rules and symbols for hypertagging necessitate corresponding amendments to the tree structures in the tree databank. The Case Law Manual. The Case Law Manual (Sampson, 1984) is a document that summarizes the rules and symbols for tree drawing as they were originally decided and subsequently modified after problems encountered by the linguist in working through samples of the word tagged corpus. I will only give a brief sketch of the principles contained in the Case Law Manual in this paper. Any sequence in the word tagged corpus marked as a sentence is given a root hypertag, &apos;S&apos;. Between &apos;S&apos; and the word tag level of analysis, all constituents perceived by the linguist to be consisting of more than one word and, in some cases, single word constituents, are labell</context>

Form takes precedence over function so that, for instance, in fact is labelled as a prepositianirParase rather than as an adverbial phrase. No attempt is made to show any paraphrase relationships. Putative deleted or transposed elements are, in general, not referred to in the Case Law Manual, the exceptions to this general principle being in the treatment of some coordinated constructions and in the analysis of constructions involving what transformational grammarians call unbounded movement rules (Sampson, 1984: 2). The sentences in the LOB corpus present the linguist with the enormously rich variety of English syntactic constructions that occurs in newspapers, books and journals; and they also force issues - such as how to incorporate punctuation into the parsing scheme, how to deal with numbered lists and dates in brackets - issues which, although present and familiar in ordinary written language, are not generally, if at all, accounted for in current formalized grammars.
