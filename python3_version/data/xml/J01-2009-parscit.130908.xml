The recent advances in information retrieval (IR) in this collection of ten original
papers reflect the wide range of research topics developed at the Center for Intelligent
Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. W. Bruce
Croft, the Director of CIIR and the editor of this volume, presents in the preface both
the history and the impressive research track of the center. The preface also lists the
topics covered in the collection, reflecting the fact that the majority of the papers deal
with research in traditional IR or with architecture and implementation issues. Only
one of the papers tackles new areas, namely the topic detection and tracking problem.
Surprisingly, none of the papers address one of the most exciting new IR tasks: the
open-domain textual question-answering task. As one might expect, the papers in this
volume are of varying quality. However, both the IR researcher and the computational
linguist will find at least two of the papers outstanding.
Warren Greiff&apos;s paper &amp;quot;The use of exploratory data analysis in information re-
trieval research&amp;quot; reports on a new line of research that uncovers statistical regularities
in novel ways. By analyzing data using the notion of weight of evidence, Greiff ob-
tains a new formulation of the inverse document frequency (IDF) that generates results
of the same quality as those obtained using traditional IDF measures. Moreover, this
data-driven approach is extended to other IR measures, such as term frequency and
document length. This approach, comprising four incremental models, generates a
ranking formula that is shown to perform similarly to the INQUERY system. Greiff&apos;s
data-driven model has special promise as it allows natural extensions based on ad-
ditional sources of evidence such as thesaurus terms or phrases. This technique is an
ideal research vehicle for traditional and modern IR.
The second paper that presents outstanding new research is &amp;quot;Topic detection and
tracking: Event clustering as a basis for first story detection&amp;quot; by Ron Papka and James
Allan. This paper captivates the reader by presenting an overview of the topic detection
and tracking (TDT) problem, whose purpose is to organize broadcast news stories by
the real-world events that they discuss. The paper describes the research problems
considered in all three phases of the TDT and focuses on the solutions developed at
CIIR for one of the problems, namely the detection problem—that is, identifying when
new topics have appeared in the news stream. The approach discussed is both practical
and technically interesting as it presents both new algorithms and modifications of
existing IR techniques for the TDT problem.

Another strength of the volume comes from the expertise in language modeling
developed at CIIR. The contribution of language models to several aspects of IR is well
represented, appealing to researchers interested in statistical natural language process-
ing (NLP). Two different language models are presented. The first model, originally
introduced by Ponte and Croft (1998), is described from two different perspectives.
In &amp;quot;Combining approaches to information retrieval,&amp;quot; by Bruce Croft, the Ponte and
Croft language model is considered when dealing with combinations of evidence gen-
erated by merging retrieval models and strategies. This paper also contains a wealth
of information, representative of more than ten years of IR research into combining
retrieval representations, retrieval algorithms, and search results. The same language
model is also considered in &amp;quot;Language models for relevance feedback&amp;quot; by Jay Ponte,
where relevance feedback and routing techniques are derived. Ponte&apos;s paper supports
the theoretical findings with extensive experimental data.
A different, unigram language model is described in &amp;quot;Topic-based language mod-
els for distributed retrieval&amp;quot; by Jinxi Xu and Bruce Croft. This new language model,
called topic model, is used to characterize the content of a specific topic from a given
collection. In this paper, topics are approximated as document clusters, produced with
the k-means clustering algorithm (Jain and Dubes 1988). This representation entails
three new methods for distributed IR, suitable for different environments, including
dynamic ones. Readers interested in other aspects of distributed IR are presented with
an excellent account of the techniques involved in resource selection and merging of
document rankings in Jamie Callan&apos;s paper &amp;quot;Distributed information retrieval.&amp;quot; This
paper lists experimental data that demonstrates the effectiveness of distributed IR tech-
niques. The architecture of distributed IR systems is considered in &amp;quot;The effect of collec-
tion organization and query locality on information retrieval system performance&amp;quot; by
Zhihong Lu and Kathryn McKinley. The authors&apos; expertise in distributed and parallel
systems ports new, interesting research perspectives to the problem of distributed IR.
The volume also contains papers on automatic derivations of concept hierarchies,
cross-language retrieval and image retrieval. In &amp;quot;Building, testing, and applying con-
cept hierarchies,&amp;quot; Mark Sanderson and Dawn Lawrie present a method of automati-
cally devising concept hierarchies based on document term frequencies, a metric that
was recently used by Caraballo and Charniak (1999) to determine the specificity of
nouns in texts. In &amp;quot;Cross-language retrieval via transitive translation,&amp;quot; Lisa Ballesteros
presents the CIIR efforts in cross-lingual IR, focusing on a dictionary-based approach.
In &amp;quot;Appearance-based global similarity retrieval of images,&amp;quot; S. Chandu Ravela and
C. Luo present a technique of computing global appearance similarity, which enables
appearance-based retrieval of images.
To the computational linguist, this collection of articles has interest for at least
three reasons. First, the past years have shown that several NLP techniques play a
central role in one of the most exciting new applications in IR: Open-domain textual
question answering (Q/A)—that is, the task of producing answers in the form of
text snippets from a corpus whenever an open-domain natural language question is
posed.&apos; The development of recent Q/ A systems paved the way to new models of IR
and especially to novel semantic processing mechanisms, able to operate on more and
more complex questions and text passages. It is clear that this new interest in semantic
processing will find its way into mainstream NLP.

1 Research in the area of information retrieval has been encouraged by the Text Retrieval Conference
(TREC), sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In 1999, TREC initiated a
Question-Answering track, whose aim is to foster research in the area of textual Q/A, especially when
pursued in a domain-independent manner.

Second, NLP approaches incorporating IR techniques or metrics are often practical
solutions to difficult problems of text processing. Examples are the text segmentation
method proposed by Hearst (1994, 1997), which employs the cosine similarity used
in vector IR models; the dialogue manager described by Chu-Carroll and Carpenter
(1998) using a routing module based on latent semantic indexing, a technique widely
used in IR; and the more recent summarization methods of Berger and Mittal (2000)
based on one of the new language models developed in IR (Ponte and Croft 1998).
Third, modern IR is both a provider of new language models, to be used in differ-
ent natural language processing tasks, and an application in need of deeper semantic
processing of language. In summary, the book makes very interesting reading for ca-
sual or serious developers of IR systems and anyone who is interested in obtaining
pragmatic knowledge from text passages.
