Compared to the telephone, email based cus-
tomer care is increasingly becoming the pre-
ferred channel of communication for corpora-
tions and customers. Most email-based cus-
tomer care management systems provide a
method to include template texts in order to re-
duce the handling time for a customer’s email.
The text in a template is suitably modified
into a response by a customer care agent. In
this paper, we present two techniques to im-
prove the effectiveness of a template by pro-
viding tools for the template authors. First,
we present a tool to track and visualize the ed-
its made by agents to a template which serves
as a vital feedback to the template authors.
Second, we present a novel method that au-
tomatically extracts potential templates from
responses authored by agents. These meth-
ods are investigated in the context of an email
customer care analysis tool that handles over a
million emails a year.

Email based customer care is increasingly becom-
ing the preferred channel of communication for cor-
porations and customers compared to the conven-
tional telephone-based customer care. For cus-
tomers, email channel offers several advantages –
there are no tedious menus to navigate, there is no
waiting time to reach an operator, the request can
be formulated at the customer’s pace and additional
material supporting the case can be attached to the
email. There is also a record of the service re-
quest for the customer unlike the telephone-based
customer care. However, there are also limitations
of the email channel. The most significant one is
that the customer-agent interaction could be drawn
out over successive emails spanning over several
days as opposed to being resolved in one or two

telephone calls. For corporations, the asynchronous
nature of email-based customer care offers signifi-
cant opportunities to reduce operations cost by ef-
fective load balancing compared to telephone-based
customer care. It is quite common for an email cus-
tomer care agent to work on several cases simulta-
neously over a period of a few hours. Email chan-
nel also offers higher bandwidth for corporations to
send additional information in the form of web links,
images and video or audio instructions.
The effectiveness of customer care in the email
channel is measured using two competing metrics:
Average Handling Time (AHT) and Customer Ex-
perience Evaluation (CEE). AHT measures the time
taken from when a customer email is opened to the
time when the response is sent out. This time is typ-
ically averaged over a period of a week or a month
for reporting purposes. CEE measures customer sat-
isfaction through a survey of a random subset of cus-
tomers who have interacted with the email customer
care center. These surveys typically involve qual-
itative and quantitative questions and measure the
quality of the interactions along a number of differ-
ent dimensions. As is the case in many surveys the
population responding to such questionnaires is typ-
ically small and very often quite biased. We do not
use the CEE metric for the work we report in this
paper.
As is evident from the definitions of AHT and
CEE, it is in the interest of a corporation to minimize
AHT while maximizing CEE. In order to reduce
AHT, most email customer care systems (Kana,
2008; Genesys, 2008) provide a mechanism for an
agent to respond to a customer’s email by selecting
a predefined template text that can be quickly cus-
tomized to serve as the response. The template text
is usually associated with a problem category it is in-
tended to address and might even be suggested to the
agent automatically using classification techniques

applied to the customer’s email. Once the template
is selected, the agent edits the template text to per-
sonalize as well as add case specific details as part
of composing a response. Each of the text edits con-
tributes to the handling time of the email. Hence,
it is in the interest of the template designer to mini-
mize the number of edits of the template in order to
lower AHT.
Although most email management systems pro-
vide a mechanism to author the template text, there
is typically no mechanism to monitor and track how
these templates are modified by the agents when
they compose a response. This information is vital
to the template authors when creating new versions
of the templates that reduce the number of edits and
consequently reduce AHT.
In this paper, we present two methods for improv-
ing the templates in a principled manner. After de-
scribing the related work in Section 2, we present a
brief description of the email tracking tool we have
developed in Section 3. In Section 4, we present
a tool called HotSpots that helps visualize the edits
being made by the customer care agents to the tem-
plates. This tool provides a visual feedback to the
template authors and suggests means of improving
the template text based on the edits made by agents.
In Section 5, we present a new approach to automat-
ically identify emerging templates – texts that are
repeatedly created by agents and are similar to each
other but distinct from the current template text. We
use AHT as the metric to minimize for automatic
identification of emerging templates. We discuss
some of the issues concerning this work in Section 6
and conclude in Section 7.

2 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935457627119">
There are few threads of research that are relevant to
the work presented in this paper. First, the topic of
email response generation in the context of customer
care has been investigated by (Coch, 1996; Lapalme
and Kosseim, 2003; Zukerman and Marom, 2007).
In (Coch, 1996), the authors model multi-sentence
generation of response letters to customer com-
plaints in French. The generation model is carefully
crafted for the domain using domain-specific rules
for conceptual planning, rhetorical relations and sur-
face word order operators. They show that their
approach performs better than predefined templates
and slightly worse than human generated responses.
In (Lapalme and Kosseim, 2003), the authors ex-
plore three different approaches based on classifica-
tion, case-based reasoning and question-answering
to compose responses to queries in an email cus-
tomer care application for the telecommunication in-
dustry. The case-based reasoning approach is the
most similar to the template approach we follow. In
(Zukerman and Marom, 2007), the authors investi-
gate an approach to assembling a response by first
predicting the clusters of sentences to be included in
the response text and then applying multi-document
summarization techniques to collate the representa-
tive sentences into a single response. In contrast, in
this paper, due to constraints from the deployment
environment, we rely on a template-based approach
to response generation. We focus on providing tools
for investigating how the templates are modified and
suggest techniques for evolving more effective tem-
plates based on quantitative criteria.
Another thread of relevant research are methods
for visualizing texts. There are several methods that
have been proposed to provide a visual map of a set
of text documents with the focus of illustrating the
relatedness of these texts (Card et al., 1999). Us-
ing a metric for comparing texts (e.g. n-gram over-
lap) , the texts are clustered and the resulting clus-
ters are visualized as two or three dimensional color
maps. These approaches are useful to depict similar-
ities in a static repository of documents or the return
results of a search query. These maps are primar-
ily designed for exploration and navigation through
the document space. While the underlying algorithm
we use to illustrate the text edits is similar to the one
used in text map visualizations, our focus in this pa-
per is to provide a mechanism for template designers
to quickly identify the variants of a template sen-
tence created by the agents.
A third thread is in the context of human-
assisted machine translation, where a human trans-
lator post-edits the output of a machine translation
system (Foster et al., 1997; Foster et al., 2002; Och
et al., 2003). In order to improve the efficiency of
a human translator, the k-best output of a translation
system could be displayed as word or phrase choices
which are color coded based on the confidence value
assigned by the translation model. While the ap-
</bodyText>

proach we follow is partly motivated by the post-
editing paradigm, there are significant differences in
the context we apply this approach. In the context
of this paper, the template designer is presented a
summary of the set of variants created by each agent
for each sentence of the template. The task of the
template designer is to use this tool to select (or con-
struct) a new variant for the template sentence with
the aim of minimizing the need for editing that sen-
tence in future uses of the template.

3 Email Customer Care
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992639791666667">
Typically, a large email customer care management
center receives over 100,000 emails a month. These
centers typically use a customer care management
system that offer not only logging and tracking of
emails but also tools for improving the efficiency
of agents responding to emails. Usually, an incom-
ing customer email is categorized into a set of few
topics/issues. The categorization might be done au-
tomatically based on regular expressions involving
keywords in the email or using weighted classifiers
that are trained on data. In order for an agent to re-
spond to an incoming email, these systems provide a
text box which allows the agent to author a response
from scratch. However, most email customer care
systems offer the ability to store a prefabricated re-
sponse (also called templates), instead of agents hav-
ing to author a response from scratch. These tem-
plates are typically associated with a problem cate-
gory or an issue that they are intended to address.
A template helps an agent compose a well-formed
response quickly. It contains hints for information
that the agent should enter as well as indications of
where that information should be entered in the tem-
plate. The template might also contain helpful infor-
mation to the customer in addition to legal verbiage
that the customer needs to be aware of.
An agent receives a customer email and after
comprehending the issues and consulting the cus-
tomer records in the database, selects one of the pre-
defined set of templates that best addresses the is-
sues raised in the email. Less frequently, she might
even select more than one template to compose the
response. She then proceeds to edit and personal-
ize the chosen templates to better suit the customer’s
email. An example of a ‘generic’ template – not as-
sociated with a specific problem category is shown
in Figure 1.

The process of selecting an appropriate template
that addresses the customer’s inquiries could be
quite tedious when there are hundreds of templates.
Email management systems offer tools that suggest
appropriate template to use based on the content of
the customer’s email. These tools are trained using
classification techniques on previous email interac-
tions.
As mentioned earlier, there are two metrics that
are typically used to measure the effectiveness and
efficiency of email responses. Customers are sur-
veyed after their email interaction to assess their
level of satisfaction for the service they received.
This is usually called the Customer Experience
Evaluation (CEE) and includes an evaluation of the
customer’s total interaction experience with the cor-
poration, not just the last email interaction. A small
subset of customers who had an interaction with the
email center is randomly chosen (typically in the or-
der of about 10% of customers) and are invited to
take part in the follow-up survey. Typically, only
a small percent (about 10%) of the customers who
receive these invitations respond to the survey; ef-
fectively about 1% of the total emails have customer
survey scores.
A second metric that is also used to measure the
efficiency of an operation is called the average han-
dling time (AHT) which measures the average of
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999871833333333">
times taken by agents to respond to emails. The
handling time includes the time to comprehend the
email, the time for database lookup and the time for
response composition. It is in the interest of the
email customer care operation to minimize AHT and
maximize CEE scores.

3.1 Email Customer Care Analysis Tool
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994136986302">
We have designed and developed an Email Customer
Care Analysis Tool (ECAT) to help analyze the op-
erations of the email care center. It provides an end-
to-end view from the activities involved in answer-
ing emails to the results of subsequent customer care
surveys. In addition, ECAT also provides insights
into how the agents are editing templates as well as
guides template authors in designing more effective
templates.
ECAT is a web-based tool and offers a birds-eye
summary of the operations aggregated by region,
the template used, and the customer satisfaction sur-
vey results. Using this tool, analysts can drill down
through a series of views until they are eventually
presented with the results of a single survey or a sin-
gle email interaction.
One of the most useful functions of the tool is that
it shows the extent to which agents edit the tem-
plates in the process of creating responses to cus-
tomer emails. The degree to which a template is
edited is based on Levenshtein string edit distance
metric (Levenshtein, 1966). This metric measures
the number of edits (substitution, deletion and inser-
tions) of words that are needed to transform a tem-
plate into a response. The number of edits is normal-
ized by the number of words in the template. These
morphing scores can be viewed for a single email or
averaged per agent or per template used. The scores
range from 100 to 0, with 100 representing a tem-
plate which hadn’t been edited at all.
The tool also allows the morphing score to be
viewed alongside the handling time for an email, in
other words the amount of time that the agent spends
gathering data and actually composing a response.
Handling time is an important metric since it is di-
rectly related to cost of operating the email customer
care center. The more editing an agent does, the
more time they take to respond to a customer. So,
the number of templates, their precise wording and
the ease with which agents can distinguish them ob-
viously have significant influences on overall han-
dling time.
Beyond the confines of the email centers them-
selves, the CEE is the most important elements in
gauging the effectiveness of the agent. The survey
asks customers to rate their overall satisfaction with
the email reply to their question. Five is the high-
est score which equates with ‘Extremely Satisfied’
while a one equals ‘Extremely Dissatisfied.’ Cus-
tomers are also asked to rank the email in terms of
it’s content, clarity, professionalism and the length
of time it took to receive a reply. The customer is
also allowed to enter some free text so that they can
say how satisfied they were, or not, with how an in-
quiry or problem was dealt with. Customers can also
say whether they called the company using a tele-
phone channel before turning to the email channel.
The survey files, all of which can be accessed in
their entirety from within the ECAT tool, also con-
tain information on what templates were used when
replying to the customer. They also tell the analyst
who the replying agent was and whether this was
the first or a subsequent email in communications
between the customer and the company.
The ECAT tool juxtaposes this CEE score with
the template morphing score to show correlations
between customer satisfaction and the degree to
which the template had been edited. This data is
graphed so that the analyst can immediately see if
heavy editing of a template is leading to higher CEE.
Heavy editing with a low customer rating could
mean that the template is not helping the agent to
respond correctly to the customer.

sponse string. For the purposes of this paper, we
consider the alignments between the template text
and the response text with sentences as tokens in-
stead of a word-based alignment. The rationale
for this tokenization is that for template develop-
ers the visualization of the edits is expected to be
more meaningful when aggregated at the sentence
level rather than at the word level. In the second
step, using the sentence-level alignment we compute
the edit events (insertion, deletion and substitution)
of the template sentences in order to create the re-
sponse. All the edits events associated with a tem-
plate sentence are then clustered into k clusters and
the centroids of the k clusters are displayed as the
potential changes to that sentence. We next describe
these two steps in detail as illustrated in Algorithm
1 and Algorithm 2.
Given a set of responses R that agents create us-
ing a template T, Algorithm 1 proceeds as follows.
Each of the sentences in the template and the set of
responses are mapped into an integer index (Line
1). The template T and each of the responses in
R are split into sentences and mapped into index
sequences (Line 6 and Line 9). The alignment be-
tween the two index strings is computed in Line
10. This is a dynamic programming algorithm sim-
ilar to computing Levenshtein distance between two
strings, except the cost function used to compute the
match between tokens is as shown below.
From the alignment that maps si to rj, we collect
the set of response sentences associated with each
template sentence (Line 13-16). These sentences are
then clustered using k-median clustering method (il-
lustrated in Algorithm 2) in Line 22.
In Algorithm 2, we illustrate the method of clus-
tering we use to summarize the set of sentences we
have collected for each template sentence after the
alignment step. The algorithm is similar to the k-
means algorithm (Duda et al., 2001), however, given
that we are clustering strings instead of real num-
bers (as is typical in applications of k-means), we re-
strict the centroid of a cluster to be one of the mem-
bers of the set being clustered, hence the name k-
median algorithm (Martnez-Hinarejos et al., 2003).
The distance function to measure the closeness of
two strings is instantiated to be an n-gram overlap
between the two strings.1
The algorithm iterates over three steps until the
data is partitioned into k clusters (Line 5). The first
step (Lines 6-10) is the initialization of a centroid
for a new cluster. Initially when the data is not parti-
tioned into any cluster, the median string of the data
set is used as the initial centroid. For subsequent
iterations, the farthest point from all the centroids
computed thus far is used as the centroid for the new
cluster. In the second step (Lines 11-16), each mem-
ber of the data set is assigned to the nearest clus-
ter based on its distance to that cluster’s centroid.
Finally, in the third step (Lines 17-20), the cluster
centroids are recomputed based on the new cluster
memberships. Steps two and three are repeated until
there are no changes in the cluster memberships and
cluster centroids. This completes the introduction of
a new cluster for the data.
For the purposes of our task, we use up to a
four-gram overlap to measure distance between two
strings and use k = 5 for clustering the data.

The HotSpots page was created within the ECAT
tool to surgically dissect the way in which templates
were being morphed. For a given template, as shown
in Figure 2, the analyst is presented with a copy of
the texts from the current and previous versions of
that template. Each sentence in the two versions
of the template are color coded to show how fre-
quently the agents have changed that sentence. This
involved running the HotSpots algorithm against ap-
proximately 1,000 emails per template version. A
sentence that is colored red is one that was changed
in over 50% of the emails that were responded to
using that template. An orange sentence is one that
was edited in between 30% and 50%, green is be-
tween 10% to 30% and blue is between 0% and 10%.
The more often a sentence is edited the ‘hotter’ the
color.

sentence by hovering the mouse over that sentence.

In seeing the two versions side by side, the an-
alyst can visually inspect the agents’ edits on the
current version of a template relative to the previ-
ous version. If the previous version of the template
is a ‘hotter’ document (with more red sentences), it
means that the changes made to the template by the
author had led to less editing by agents thus speeding
up the process of creating a customer response. If
the current template looks hotter, it suggests that the
changes made to the template were increasing the
agents’ edits and probably the email handling time.

5 Automatic Extraction of Potential
Templates

<bodyText confidence="0.999718818181818">
The goal of the template author is to minimize the
number of edits done to a template and thus in-
directly lowering the handling time for an email.
In the preceding section, we discussed a tool that
aids the template authors to identify sentences where
changes are most often made by agents to a tem-
plate. This information could be used by the tem-
plate authors to create a new version of the template
that achieve the goal.
In this section, we investigate a technique that au-
tomatically identifies a possible template with the
potential of directly minimizing the average han-
dling time for an email. We use the set of responses
created by the agents using a given template and se-
lect one of the responses to be generalized and stored
as a new template. The response to be converted
into a template is chosen so as to directly minimize
the average handling time. In essence, we seek to
partition the set of responses R generated from tem-
plate T into two clusters R1 and R2. These clus-
ters have centroids T (current template) and T&apos; (new
template) such that constraint shown in 1 holds.

We model AHT as a linear combination of sev-
eral factors which we believe would influence the
handling time for an email. These factors in-
clude the length in words of the customer’s input
email (inplen), the length in words of the template
(templatelen), the length in words of the response
(resplen), the total number of edits between the
template and the response (edit), the normalized edit
score (nedit), the number of individual events of
the edit distance – substitution (sub), insertion (ins),
deletion (del) and identity (id), the number of block
(contiguous) substitution (blksub), block insertion
(blkins) and block deletion (blkdel). Using these in-
dependent variables, we fit a linear regression model
using the AHT values for 6175 responses created
from one particular template (say G). The result of
the regression fit is shown in Equation 2 and the data
and error statistics are shown in Table 2. It must be
noted that the coefficients for the variables are not
necessarily reflective of the importance of the vari-
ables, since they compensate for the different ranges
in variable values. We have also tried several differ-

for all responses created from the same template.
ent regression fits with fewer variables, but find that
this fit gives us the best correlation with the data.

tomer’s email, the database retrieval to access the
customer’s account and so forth.
Nevertheless, we use this model to cluster a new
set of 2005 responses originating from the same
template (G), as shown in Equation 1. Using the
k-median clustering as described earlier, we parti-
tion the responses into two clusters. We restrict the
first cluster centroid to be the template and search
for the best centroid for the second cluster. The re-
sults are shown in Table 1. The centroid for clus-
ter 1 with 1799 members is the template itself while
the centroid for cluster 2 with 206 members is a re-
sponse that could be suitably generalized to serve as
a template. The overall AHT for the 2005 responses
using the template was 989.2 seconds, while the av-
erage AHT for the members of cluster 1 and 2 was
971.9 seconds and 1140 seconds, indicating that the
template had to be edited considerably to create the
members of cluster 2.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999905">
For the purposes of this paper, it is assumed that
AHT is the same as or correlates well with the time
to compose a response for an email. However, in
most cases the email care agent might have to per-
form several verification, validation, and problem
resolution phases by consulting the specifics of a
customer account before formulating and compos-
ing a response. The time taken for each of these
phases typically varies depending on the customer’s
account and the problem category. Nevertheless, we
assume that the times for these phases is mostly a
constant for a given problem category, and hence the
results presented in this paper need to be interpreted
on a per problem category basis.
A second limitation of the approach presented in
this paper is that the metric used to measure the sim-
ilarity between strings (n-gram overlap) is only a
crude approximation of an ideal semantic similarity
metric. There are however other similarity metrics
(e.g. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)) which could be
used equally well. The purpose of this paper is to il-
lustrate the possibility of analysis of responses using
one particular instantiation of the similarity metric.
In spite of the several directions that this work can
be improved, the system and algorithms described
in this paper have been deployed in an operational
customer care center. The qualitative feedback we
have received are extremely positive and analysts
have greatly improved the efficiency of the opera-
tion using this tool.

In this paper, we have presented two approaches that
help template authors in designing effective tem-
plates for email customer care agents. In the first ap-
proach, we have presented details of a graphical tool
that provides vital feedback to the template authors
on how their templates are being modified by agents
when creating responses. The template authors can
accommodate this information when designing the
next version of the template. We also presented a
novel technique for identifying responses that can
potentially serve as templates and reduce AHT. To-
wards this end, we discussed a method to model
AHT based on the characteristics of the customer’s
email, the template text and the response text.

<abstract confidence="0.999666863636364">Compared to the telephone, email based customer care is increasingly becoming the preferred channel of communication for corporations and customers. Most email-based customer care management systems provide a method to include template texts in order to reduce the handling time for a customer’s email. The text in a template is suitably modified into a response by a customer care agent. In this paper, we present two techniques to improve the effectiveness of a template by providing tools for the template authors. First, we present a tool to track and visualize the edits made by agents to a template which serves as a vital feedback to the template authors. Second, we present a novel method that automatically extracts potential templates from responses authored by agents. These methods are investigated in the context of an email customer care analysis tool that handles over a million emails a year.</abstract>

In contrast, in this paper, due to constraints from the deployment environment, we rely on a template-based approach to response generation. We focus on providing tools for investigating how the templates are modified and suggest techniques for evolving more effective templates based on quantitative criteria. Another thread of relevant research are methods for visualizing texts. There are several methods that have been proposed to provide a visual map of a set of text documents with the focus of illustrating the relatedness of these texts (Card et al., 1999). Using a metric for comparing texts (e.g. n-gram overlap) , the texts are clustered and the resulting clusters are visualized as two or three dimensional color maps. These approaches are useful to depict similarities in a static repository of documents or the return results of a search query. These maps are primarily designed for exploration and navigation through the document space. While the underlying algorithm we use to illustrate the text edits is similar to the one used in text map visualizations, our focus in this paper is to provide a mechanism for template designers to quickly identi</context>

These surveys typically involve qualitative and quantitative questions and measure the quality of the interactions along a number of different dimensions. As is the case in many surveys the population responding to such questionnaires is typically small and very often quite biased. We do not use the CEE metric for the work we report in this paper. As is evident from the definitions of AHT and CEE, it is in the interest of a corporation to minimize AHT while maximizing CEE. In order to reduce AHT, most email customer care systems (Kana, 2008; Genesys, 2008) provide a mechanism for an agent to respond to a customer’s email by selecting a predefined template text that can be quickly customized to serve as the response.

ECAT is a web-based tool and offers a birds-eye summary of the operations aggregated by region, the template used, and the customer satisfaction survey results. Using this tool, analysts can drill down through a series of views until they are eventually presented with the results of a single survey or a single email interaction. One of the most useful functions of the tool is that it shows the extent to which agents edit the templates in the process of creating responses to customer emails. The degree to which a template is edited is based on Levenshtein string edit distance metric (Levenshtein, 1966). This metric measures the number of edits (substitution, deletion and insertions) of words that are needed to transform a template into a response. The number of edits is normalized by the number of words in the template. These morphing scores can be viewed for a single email or averaged per agent or per template used. The scores range from 100 to 0, with 100 representing a template which hadn’t been edited at all. The tool also allows the morphing score to be viewed alongside the handling time for an email, in other words the amount of time that the agent spends gathering data and actually c</context>

These maps are primarily designed for exploration and navigation through the document space. While the underlying algorithm we use to illustrate the text edits is similar to the one used in text map visualizations, our focus in this paper is to provide a mechanism for template designers to quickly identify the variants of a template sentence created by the agents. A third thread is in the context of humanassisted machine translation, where a human translator post-edits the output of a machine translation system (Foster et al., 1997; Foster et al., 2002; Och et al., 2003). In order to improve the efficiency of a human translator, the k-best output of a translation system could be displayed as word or phrase choices which are color coded based on the confidence value assigned by the translation model. While the ap265 proach we follow is partly motivated by the postediting paradigm, there are significant differences in the context we apply this approach. In the context of this paper, the template designer is presented a summary of the set of variants created by each agent for each sentence of the template. The task of the template designer is to use this tool to</context>

The time taken for each of these phases typically varies depending on the customer’s account and the problem category. Nevertheless, we assume that the times for these phases is mostly a constant for a given problem category, and hence the results presented in this paper need to be interpreted on a per problem category basis. A second limitation of the approach presented in this paper is that the metric used to measure the similarity between strings (n-gram overlap) is only a crude approximation of an ideal semantic similarity metric. There are however other similarity metrics (e.g. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)) which could be used equally well. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the possibility of analysis of responses using one particular instantiation of the similarity metric. In spite of the several directions that this work can be improved, the system and algorithms described in this paper have been deployed in an operational customer care center. The qualitative feedback we have received are extremely positive and analysts have greatly improved the efficiency of the operation using this tool. 7 Conclusions In this paper, we have presented two approaches that help template authors in de</context>

We use AHT as the metric to minimize for automatic identification of emerging templates. We discuss some of the issues concerning this work in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7. 2 Related Work There are few threads of research that are relevant to the work presented in this paper. First, the topic of email response generation in the context of customer care has been investigated by (Coch, 1996; Lapalme and Kosseim, 2003; Zukerman and Marom, 2007). In (Coch, 1996), the authors model multi-sentence generation of response letters to customer complaints in French. The generation model is carefully crafted for the domain using domain-specific rules for conceptual planning, rhetorical relations and surface word order operators. They show that their approach performs better than predefined templates and slightly worse than human generated responses. In (Lapalme and Kosseim, 2003), the authors explore three different approaches based on classification, case-based reasoning and question-answering to compose responses to queries in an email cus</context>
