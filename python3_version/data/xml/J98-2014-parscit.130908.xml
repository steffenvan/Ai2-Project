(Series on Second Language Research:
Theoretical and Methodological Issues,
edited-by Susan Gass and Jacquelyn
Schacter), 1997, ix+125 pp; hardbound, ISBN

Referential Communication Tasks offers, in a
small format (125 pages), a general survey
of experimental settings and scientific back-
ground on communication studies centered
on specific activities in which the speakers
are observed for their ability to achieve tasks
rather than solely for their linguistic produc-
tions. It thus offers a basic and introductory
insight to research and experiments that put
the notion of reference at the core of their
interest. Here the focus is generally on ex-
periments in the broad field of L2 studies.
Though the author does not really insist on
the theoretical backgrounds of the different
studies being presented, it is made very clear
that the language that is being described is
that spoken spontaneously in situations (es-
pecially in L2 contexts) in which speakers
might not even be able to correctly designate
the objects they want to refer to and therefore
need to develop linguistic and other commu-
nicative strategies to circumvent their diffi-
culties. It is thus important to remember that
reference is not simply &amp;quot;some kind of connec-
tion between words and things&amp;quot; but rather,
as stated in the first chapter of the book
(&amp;quot;Overview&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;an action through which a
speaker (or writer) uses linguistic forms to
enable a listener (or reader) to identify some-
thing.&amp;quot;
Apart from the second chapter (&amp;quot;The de-
velopment of (L1) referential communica-
tion&amp;quot;), which is too short to be really infor-
mative, the book is centered on three main
sections, dedicated respectively to the main
trends, the experimental settings, and the
study viewpoints associated with referen-
tial communication tasks. First, Chapter 3
(&amp;quot;Principles and distinctions&amp;quot;) lists the main
parameters—from the point of view of what
is to be elicited as well as the task format—
that are to lead an experimenter towards
the design of a specific experimental set-
ting adapted to his research interest. The au-
thor then presents (Chapter 4, &amp;quot;Materials and
procedures&amp;quot;) in a rather exhaustive way the
different kinds of situations that have been
used in the literature to conduct referential
task studies, ranging from object identifica-
tion to instructional map tasks (which are
well known in the computational linguistics
community). Finally, Chapter 5 (&amp;quot;Analytic
frameworks&amp;quot;) quickly surveys the possible
viewpoints that the researcher may take to
consider the linguistic productions resulting
from the different experimental frameworks
presented in the book, insisting on commu-
nication strategies, interactive repair mecha-
nisms, and communicative outcomes.
Even though the book is far from present-
ing a theoretical insight into the field, as
a whole it provides a wide and extensive
overview of experimental materials and prin-
ciples that, considered from the point of view
of computational linguistics, would be of in-
terest to anyone interested in dialogue stud-
ies in which reference plays a central role.
Since the book seems to be intended to pro-
vide the basics of some research methodol-
ogy, one may regret that the literature that
is mentioned contains so few associated ba-
sic readings, which could have been most
valuable for young researchers starting in
the field of communication research. Still, its
small format makes it worth reading and
even to have within reach for those of us who
at some point or another have to deal with,
or even produce, experimental data.

We use vague language without difficulty.
Yet, if asked whether a vague word ap-
plies to a particular object, we might be at
a loss. Is that man tall? If he is 195 cm,
clearly yes. If he is 165 cm, clearly no. But
in many intermediate cases, we simply can-
not say. Vagueness also presents theoretical
problems, among them the so-called sorites
paradoxes. It would appear that a man who
is a fraction of a millimeter shorter than a

tall man is tall. But then, with repeated ap-
plication of this principle, it seems to follow,
paradoxically, that since a 195 cm man is tall,
so is a 165 cm man.
The difficulties surrounding vagueness
have ramifications within artificial intelli-
gence. We might wish to include vague rep-
resentations in knowledge bases, and in com-
putational linguistics we will certainly have
to come to terms with vagueness. Ques-
tions immediately arise about how to rep-
resent vague sentences and what to infer
from them. To answer these questions, an ac-
count of the meanings of vague sentences is
needed.
Rosanna Keefe and Peter Smith have com-
piled a collection of classic papers on vague-
ness. Three ancient writings provide histor-
ical perspective; fourteen others chart the
development of the contemporary discus-
sion of vagueness throughout this century.
Contributions that might be of special in-
terest to researchers in artificial intelligence
include Kit Fine&apos;s &amp;quot;Vagueness, truth and
logic,&amp;quot; which sets out the supervaluational
approach to vagueness. This approach is sup-
posed to account for vagueness while pre-
serving classical logic. Kenton Machina de-
fends the approach to vagueness through
fuzzy logic that was pioneered by Zadeh and
Goguen. Dorothy Edgington criticizes this
approach and suggests an alternative many-
valued treatment. Max Black explores the
idea that the applicability of a predicate to
an object is a matter of degree, determined by
the applicability judgments of the language
community at large. Carl Hempel provides a
pointed criticism of his proposal. Other selec-
tions are philosophically rich but might only
indirectly address the concerns of the artifi-
cial intelligence community.
Keefe and Smith contribute a substantial
introductory chapter that expounds and eval-
uates these and other approaches. They dis-
cuss the sorites paradox and its significance
for logical accounts of vagueness; they de-
scribe the epistemic view, according to which
vague predicates are sharply defined but
speakers are necessarily uninformed about
their boundaries; they evaluate the various
alternatives to this view, including super-
valuational accounts, three-valued accounts,
and multivalued accounts; and they outline
the recent debate over the existence of vague
objects. The chapter extensively refers to rel-
evant material that does not appear in the
anthology.
This balanced and comprehensive collec-
tion will be a standard reference for many
years to come.—Alice Kyburg, University of

&amp;quot;Throughout the history of ideas, various
branches of philosophy have spun off into
the natural sciences, including physics, bi-
ology, and perhaps most recently, cognitive
psychology. A central theme of this collec-
tion is that the philosophy of language, or at
least a core portion of it, has matured to the
point where it is now being spun off into
linguistic theory. Each section of the book
contains historical (twentieth-century) read-
ings and, where available, recent attempts
to apply the resources of contemporary lin-
guistic theory to the problems under discus-
sion. This approach helps to root the nat-
uralization project in the leading questions
of analytic philosophy. Although the older
readings predate the current naturalization
project, they help to lay its conceptual foun-
dations. The main sections of the book, each
of which is preceded by an introduction,
are &apos;Language and Meaning,&apos; Logical Form
and Grammatical Form,&apos; Definite and In-
definite Descriptions,&apos; Names,&amp;quot;Demonstra-

&amp;quot;Ways of Scope Taking is concerned with syn-
tactic, semantic, and computational aspects
of scope. Its starting point is the well-known
but often neglected fact that different types
of quantifiers interact differently with each
other and other operators. The theoretical ex-
amination of significant bodies of data, both
old and novel, lead to two central claims.
(1) Scope is a by-product of a set of dis-
tinct logical form processes; each quantifier
participates in those that suit its particular
features. (2) Scope interaction is further con-
strained by the semantics of the interacting
operators. The arguments are developed us-
ing minimalist syntax, generalized quantify
[sic] theory, discourse representation theory,
and algebraic semantics.
&amp;quot;The contributors (Beghelli, Ben-Shalom,
Doetjes, Farkas, Gutierrez Rexach, Hon-
coop, Stabler, Stowell, Szabolcsi, and Zwarts)
make tightly related theoretical assumptions
and focus on related empirical phenom-
ena, which include the direct and inverse
scope of quantifiers, distributivity, negation,
modal and intensional contexts, weak is-
lands, event-related readings, interrogatives,
wh / quantifier interactions, and Hungarian
syntax. An introduction to the formal seman-
tics background is provided.&amp;quot;—From the pub-
