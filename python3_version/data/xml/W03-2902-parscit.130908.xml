<bodyText confidence="0.999445916666667">
In this paper we describe the mapping of
Zaliznjak’s (1977) morphological classes
into the lexical representation language
DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1996). On the
basis of the resulting DATR theory a set of
fully inflected forms together with their as-
sociated morphosyntax can automatically
be generated from the electronic version of
Zaliznjak’s dictionary (Ilola and Mustajoki
1989). From this data we plan to develop a
wide-coverage morphosyntactic lemma-
tizer and tagger for Russian.

Our goal is to undertake a detailed corpus analysis
of Russian texts, focusing on the relationship be-
tween morphological ambiguity (syncretism) in
nouns and adjectives and the comparative fre-
quency of the relevant grammatical categories. For
this purpose, we will use two corpora, the Uppsala
corpus (Lönngren 1993, Maier 1994) and a corpus
of Russian newspaper texts from the late 1990’s,
for which we require detailed morphosyntactic an-
notation. However, suitably annotated versions of
these corpora are not yet freely available and cor-
pus analysis tools for Russian in general are
scarce.1
We have chosen, therefore, to develop our own
lemmatization and tagging technology, based on

a more detailed and validated hand-crafted analysis
of 1500 most frequent noun lexemes (Brown, Cor-

1.1 The Zaliznjak dictionary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998385766666667">
Zaliznjak (1977) is a reverse dictionary in book
form, dealing primarily with Russian inflectional
morphology. For each of the almost 100,000 lexi-
cal entries, indexes refer the reader to declension
types and conjugations, together with stress pat-
terns. Other symbols indicate subregularities and
irregularities. As the dictionary uses such indica-
tors, it gives explicit information about every in-
flectional form and stress. Ilola and Mustajoki
(1989: 1-5) describe how the material was adapted
for computer use.
Zaliznjak&apos;s dictionary has been the starting point
for a number of applications. Anciaux (1991) made
use of it in the creation of a spell-checker for Rus-
sian, and Pavlova, Pavlov, Sproat, Shih and van
Santen (1997) used the electronic version to create
language-specific tables to fit into the modular ar-
chitecture of the Bell Laboratories Text-to-Speech
system. Brown, Corbett and Fraser (1995) and
Brown, Hippisley, Corbett and Fraser (1995) cre-
ated a DATR lexicon of the 1500 most frequent
noun lexemes from Zasorina (1977). The derived
forms from this inheritance-based lexicon were all
checked manually against Zaliznjak. The forms are
represented in a phonological transcription, to-
gether with stress information (Brown, Corbett,
Fraser, Hippisley and Timberlake 1996). An up-
dated version of this lexicon was used in Brown
(1998) to compare different morphological theo-
ries.

2.1 The overall approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999830416666667">
In book form, Zaliznjak’s dictionary has two
parts. The first is a set of tables identifying mor-
phosyntactic classes and defining the realization
of morphological features with them. The sec-
ond is a listing of lexical entries, each followed
by an index referring to a table in the first part
which gives the paradigm for this particular
type. For example, the word a6aoxyp &apos;lamp
shade&apos; is a masculine noun of type 1A and as
such follows the inflectional pattern of saeod
‘factory’ which is given as the example para-
digm for masculine nouns of type 1A.

<bodyText confidence="0.99304975">
The electronic form contains just the set of lexi-
cal entries (101401 lines, 98729 lexical entries).
Thus our mapping process has two distinct compo-
nents:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9846744">
1. manual construction of a DATR representation
of the morphosyntactic class and realization in-
formation from the printed paradigm tables;
2. automatic construction of the individual lexical
entries from the electronic dictionary data.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996648">
In practice we also introduce a third component,
interfacing between the morphosyntactic classes
and the automatic entries. As we discuss below,
this gives us increased flexibility in the way we
interpret the Zaliznjak data.
The information in Zaliznjak&apos;s dictionary in-
cludes a fair number of subregular and idiosyn-
cratic cases. The target representation, DATR, is
specifically designed to support such situations,
providing concise representation of hierarchically
organized lexicons containing generalizations and
exceptions. We have already a formal theoretical
model of Russian morphology (Corbett and Fraser
1993; Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley and Tim-
berlake 1996; Brown 1998) which underlies our
approach. In addition, as we have a frequency
based resource to check against (Brown, Corbett
and Fraser 1995; Brown, Hippisley, Corbett and
Fraser 1995), we are in a good position to check
the accuracy of our automatic creation of lexical
entries for the high frequency, least regular cases.
The same framework can also be used to capture
generalisations across languages (cf. Cahill and
Gazdar 1999; Tiberius 2001), but this is not our
current goal.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9969625">
2.2 The hand-crafted realization
component
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907259259259">
Zaliznjak does not use the traditional division of
words into declension types in his dictionary, but
divides nouns into types according to the last
grapheme of the stem. (Ilola and Mustajoki
1989:9) For example, he distinguishes eight types
for masculine nouns numbered 1 to 8. These mor-
phological types are then further divided according
to stress. The masculine noun types can occur with
six different stress patterns indicated by subcatego-
ries A to F. Thus the most basic masculine noun
classes might be named M 1A, M 3C, etc.
Special characters are used to further character-
ize the different morphological types. For instance,
types with an * indicate the presence of a fleeting
vowel such as in ceexop &apos;father-in-law (husband’s
father)&apos; which has the instrumental ceexpom. Ani-
macy is indicated in combination with gender, so
that a class such as MO 1*A is masculine, animate,
type 1, stress pattern A with a fleeting vowel.
This information for each lexical entry is used to
refer to a table at the beginning of the dictionary
which gives an example of the inflectional forms.
These tables form the basis of a hand-crafted
DATR theory in which each type is represented by
a node in the DATR inheritance hierarchy. This
results in a hierarchical structure of noun classes,
part of which is shown here:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.94807375">
NOMINAL
NOUN
NOUN_M NOUN_MO NOUN_F . . .
NOUN_M_1A
</equation>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999175">
Figure 1. Extract of the DATR hierarchy
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.924172166666667">
In each node, definitions of morphosyntactic reali-
zations specific to that noun class are given. In-
formation that is shared between (or default for)
classes is inherited from the parent node. A small
fragment of the theory is provided here:2
NOMINAL:
&lt;mor&gt; == &amp;quot;&lt;stem&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;mor suffix&gt;&amp;quot;.
2 The DATR code is slightly simplified for expository purposes. Note that the
code is written to reflect Zaliznjak’s system. The main goal has not been ele-
gance and economy of representation. For theoretically-driven inheritance
representations of Russian morphology using DATR see Corbett and Fraser
(1993), Fraser and Corbett (1995), and Brown (1998).

<bodyText confidence="0.999474794117647">
Here, NOMINAL defines the morphotactics of Rus-
sian nominals (nouns and adjectives), comprising a
stem followed by a suffix that realizes the morpho-
logical features. NOUN inherits this definition and
defines three plural suffixes that are generally
shared between nouns, NOUN_M adds specific syn-
tactic features and finally NOUN_M_1A fills out the
rest of the possible suffixes. Notice that &lt;stem&gt;
is not defined in this theory – it will be determined
on a per-lexical entry basis from the automatically
generated entries described below. Notice also the
syncretic definitions for suffixes associated with
sg acc and pl acc in terms of their nominative
counterparts for inanimate nouns – for a more de-
tailed discussion of the techniques used for repre-
senting such a syncretism, see Corbett and Fraser
(1993:131) and Brown (1998:154-155).
Classes of feminine and neuter nouns are han-
dled similarly; for feminine nouns, eight types and
nine different stress patterns are identified,
whereas for neuter nouns eight types and six stress
patterns are distinguished. In addition, most of
these types are found with both animate and in-
animate nouns, and in the DATR theory, two noun
classes are distinguished for each type occurring
with both animate and inanimate nouns. In total
about 100 different noun classes are distinguished
per gender in the DATR theory.
In order to make use of this theory, a lexical en-
try needs to inherit from the node representing its
noun class and provide the specific morphotactic
elements associated with the class. So for example,
a possible definition for a6aocyp &apos;lamp shade&apos;
might be:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.920345333333333">
АБАЖУР:
&lt;&gt; == NOUN_M_1A
&lt;stem&gt; == абажур.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996663">
From this definition, plus the preceding example
fragment, the standard inference rules of DATR
allow all the relevant inflectional forms to be de-
rived:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.991022307692308">
АБАЖУР:
&lt;mor sg nom&gt; = абажур
&lt;mor sg gen&gt; = абажур а
&lt;mor sg dat&gt; = абажур у
&lt;mor sg acc&gt; = абажур
&lt;mor sg instr&gt; = абажур ом
&lt;mor sg loc&gt; = абажур е
&lt;mor pl nom&gt; = абажур ы
&lt;mor pl gen&gt; = абажур ов
&lt;mor pl dat&gt; = абажур ам
&lt;mor pl acc&gt; = абажур ы
&lt;mor pl instr&gt; = абажур ами
&lt;mor pl loc&gt; = абажур ах.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999809375">
Note that stress is not currently indicated in the
derived forms. Our research involves the morpho-
syntactic analysis of written text which generally
does not mark stress. However, as the distinctions
related to stress that are made in Zaliznjak (1977)
have been kept in the DATR theory, the stress pat-
terns can easily be used in our analysis of syncre-
tism and frequency.

2.3 Automatic generation of lexical en-
tries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971898636363636">
In its electronic form, Zaliznjak represents each
lexical entry as a text string of the sort given here
for the word a6aocyp &apos;lamp shade&apos;:
АБАЖУР 0101 АБАЖ&lt;УР М 1А
Here, the first item is the (uppercase) citation form
of the word, the second is a line identifier (line 01
of 01 lines), the third is the word annotated with
stress information, the fourth is gender/animacy
information and the fifth morphological type.
However, inevitably, many of the entries are
more complex than this in various ways:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94516295">
1. Entries can spread over several lines,
requiring textual concatenation of just the
parts following the line identifier informa-
tion to build the complete entry.
2. Where inflectional class does not corre-
spond to gender/animacy, it may be speci-
fied separately between angle brackets. For
example, dedywKa МО &lt;ЖО 3*А&gt;
‘grandfather’ is a masculine noun which
declines as a feminine noun of type 3*A.
3. Alternative values for stress patterns and
sometimes classes may be present between
square brackets.
4. Additional annotations indicate second
locative, second genitive, pluralia tantum,
irregular forms, etc.
5. Additional comments may be present en-
closed in parentheses.
6. Other punctuation (commas etc.) may or
may not be present.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917566666667">
In order to deliver lexical entry information in the
form required by the hand-crafted theory, this data
needs to be parsed and interpreted into the kind of
format we saw above. A standard approach to this
task is to use regular expression search and substi-
tute commands to incrementally rewrite the data
strings into a more uniform format and ultimately
into the required input. However, DATR itself also
provides powerful string-rewriting functionality,
particularly suited for dealing with awkward ex-
ceptional cases, but less efficient for more routine
rewriting.
The approach we have taken strikes a balance
between these two technologies. Initially we use
regular expression rewriting to achieve a basic
parse of the input data: joining multiple lines to-
gether, removing duplicate spaces, isolating vari-
ous bracketed expressions, parsing the remaining
fields and finally mapping into a DATR definition
for each entry. However this DATR definition is
very surface-oriented – little more than a basic
segmentation of the input data. This process can be
carried out completely automatically with a fairly
high accuracy. But in order to link such entries to
the core morphological classes, further interpreta-
tion of the data fields identified is necessary, and
this is achieved dynamically in DATR.
For example, a typical simple lexical entry is the
lexeme apucmoxpamxa ‘female aristocrat’. Its
entry in Zaliznjak is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.882635">
АP14CTOKPАTKА 0101 АP14CTOKP&lt;АTKА XO 3*А
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995785666666667">
In the first phase of processing, this is mapped via
regular expression search and substitute into a
DATR node definition as follows:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.623391">
Z-АP14CTOKPАTKА:
&lt;&gt; == ZALNODE
&lt;index&gt; == 30
&lt;src txt&gt; == &apos; ... &apos;
&lt;src cit&gt; == &apos;АP14CTOKPАTKА&apos;
&lt;src str&gt; == &apos;АP14CTOKP&lt;АTKА&apos;
&lt;src gen&gt; == &apos;XO&apos;
&lt;src cls&gt; == &apos;3*А&apos;.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999862769230769">
This node is an instance of the predefined node
ZALNODE with index number 30 (meaning simply
that it was the 30th node to be processed in this
batch). The &lt;src txt&gt; feature (omitted due to
lack of space) is the whole original source string,
and the other features provide the key components
of the entry (cit – citation, str – stressed, gen –
gender/animacy, cls – class).
This is the ‘surface level’ representation of the
lexical entry. The DATR node ZALNODE inter-
prets this information to define implicitly a ‘deep’
representation as required by the morphological
classes, roughly equivalent to this:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.97682475">
Z-АP14CTOKPАTKА:
&lt;&gt; == NOUN_FO_3*A
&lt;root_begin&gt; == apKCmoKpam
&lt;root_end&gt; == K.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983789473684">
Here, the gender/animacy and class information
have been combined (and transliterated to Latin
script) to determine the declension class for this
form. The stem forms for this class have been de-
termined from the citation form (the morphotactic
specification for NOUN_FO_3*A indicates what
components are required – different from the sim-
pler NOUN_M_1A case above, to allow for the pos-
sible insertion of a fleeting vowel).
ZALNODE does not actually create a new node
definition for the deep representation. Rather, ap-
propriate values for deep features are calculated
dynamically when the declension class code re-
quests them, by rewriting and transforming the
values provided by the surface form definitions.
The overall effect is that, just as we saw previ-
ously, the declension class definitions can use this
information to provide the syntax and all the in-
flected forms for this word:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.965498266666667">
Z-АP14CTOKPАTKА:
&lt;syn gender&gt; = feminine
&lt;syn animacy&gt; = animate
&lt;mor sg nom&gt; = apKCmoKpam K a
&lt;mor sg gen&gt; = apKCmoKpam K K
&lt;mor sg dat&gt; = apKCmoKpam K e
&lt;mor sg acc&gt; = apKCmoKpam K y
&lt;mor sg instr&gt; = apKCmoKpam K oK
&lt;mor sg loc&gt; = apKCmoKpam K e
&lt;mor pl nom&gt; = apKCmoKpam K K
&lt;mor pl gen&gt; = apKCmoKpam o K
&lt;mor pl dat&gt; = apKCmoKpam K am
&lt;mor pl acc&gt; = apKCmoKpam o K
&lt;mor pl instr&gt; = apKCmoKpam K amK
&lt;mor pl loc&gt; = apKCmoKpam K ax.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968052631579">
For most of these forms the inflection follows the
value of &lt;root_begin&gt; and &lt;root_end&gt;.
Notice, however, that in the genitive and accusa-
tive plural forms, a fleeting vowel, o in this case, is
inserted between these two components.
An example of a more complex lexical entry is
apmeezi &apos;soldier&apos; which is a masculine animate
noun of type 5*A. This noun has a fleeting vowel
which appears in the nominative singular apmeezi
(phonologically armejec). The writing system also
indicates the presence of the phoneme /j/ by the
use of u in the other case and number combina-
tions. To deal with this allomorphy, the DATR
node ZALNODE introduces two values for
&lt;root_begin&gt; in the ‘deep’ representation of
this lexical entry, one which is used in the nomina-
tive singular, i.e. apme, and one which is used for
all other cases, i.e. apmeu. The ‘deep’ representa-
tion for apmeeiy looks roughly like this:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.987526">
Z-АPMEEg:
&lt;&gt; == NOUN_MO_5*A
&lt;root_begin 1&gt; == apme

3 The technical framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998103">
The key technical challenge of this exercise was
actually rather mundane: we needed to find an en-
vironment or set of environments that would allow
us to do all the processing required (manual edit-
ing, regular expression search and substitute,
DATR compilation and dumping) with data that
included both Latin and Cyrillic script. In addition,
we wanted the resources we created to be maxi-
mally reusable in other contexts, so a solution in
line with agreed standards was highly desirable.
To achieve these goals, we adopted Unicode as
the standard representation for all our data, and
identified or adapted tools to work with data in that
form. Furthermore we used the simplest encoding
of Unicode in data files, the “ucs2” encoding,
which stores each 16 bit Unicode character simply
as two bytes of data. This is not as compact as
other encodings (such as “utf8”) but is supported
by a wider range of applications, in particular Mi-
crosoft Wordpad.

3.1 A Unicode version of Zaliznjak
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994909090909">
It is a fairly straightforward task to convert the
transliteration used in the electronic form of Zal-
iznjak to Unicode Cyrillic, using Microsoft Word
macros. Disambiguation of the hard and soft signs
is required for the first field, (the index word field),
as the + character is used for both symbols. How-
ever, the third field differentiates the hard and soft
sign and, as the number of lexical items written
with a hard sign is not great, it is a trivial task to
check these. The resulting files are then saved as
plain text (ie “ucs2”) Unicode files.

3.2 DATR and Unicode
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999377466666667">
The DATR compiler used for this project was the
Sussex/Brighton DATR compiler, which is written
in Prolog. The DATR compiler inherits its charac-
ter-level processing from the underlying Prolog
compiler, so in order to process Unicode DATR it
was simply necessary to run it in a Prolog system
capable of handling Unicode, and modify it
slightly to detect when it was given a Unicode file
as input. This was achieved using Poplog Prolog,3
plus a customized version of Sussex/Brighton
DATR (soon to be released as version 2.10). This
version also includes new support for batch mode
processing of DATR theories and a number of
compiler enhancements for compiling larger
DATR theories.

3.3 Editing and search and substitute in
Unicode
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974526315789">
Unicode files stored in “ucs2” encoding can be
conveniently viewed and edited using Microsoft
Word or Wordpad, the latter being more straight-
forward for the simple text-editing requirements of
most of the data files involved here. The automatic
rewriting of Zaliznjak entries required a more so-
phisticated regular expression engine, which we
obtained by adapting the Poplog editor’s regular
expression functionality to work with Unicode.
These functions are particularly powerful in allow-
ing multi-line regular expression matching, so that
one can match patterns spanning several lines
(such as Zaliznjak data continuation lines) and re-
write them to a single line. Limited manual editing
of Unicode using the Poplog editor is also possi-
ble: it can manipulate arbitrary Unicode data, but
its ability to display non-Latin data is platform de-
pendent, and on our platform (Windows 2000) all
the Cyrillic characters were displayed as ‘?’.

4. Development of a lemmatizer and tagger
for Russian using this data.
The last point here deserves further expansion. As
we discussed in the introduction, the DATR encod-
ing of Zaliznjak is in part the first step towards
lemmatization and tagging technology for Russian.
We distinguish lemmatization, that is identifying
all possible lemmas (plus morphosyntactic fea-
tures) for a word, which can be carried out on the
word in isolation, from tagging, that is, identifying
the most likely lemma (plus features) for a word in
context. The primary aim of the project of which
this work is a part is to explore ambiguity in lem-
matization and its relationship to frequency. For
this a high quality lemmatizer is essential.
In principle, once we have a complete set of in-
flected forms, we could automatically compile it
into a lemmatizer. However such a lemmatizer
would be extremely cumbersome to produce and
use, contain much redundancy and be quite inca-
pable of coping with unknown forms. The ap-
proach we intend to take will exploit the hand-
crafted components of the framework to the full,
using them to construct recognisers for suffixes
(and for verbs, prefixes) and identify potential
roots, and then using the full lexicon to filter and
validate the resulting candidate analyses (we ex-
pect the recognition process to overgenerate solu-
tions). This will be more compact, probably faster,
and able to cope with unknown root forms.
Beyond such a lemmatizer, we are currently in-
vestigating how to combine inheritance-based lexi-
cal representation with traditional part-of-speech
tagging technology, and hope to apply this work to
the Zaliznjak data, to deliver a high quality de-
tailed morphosyntactic tagger for Russian texts.
On the more technological front, current plans
include:

<bodyText confidence="0.999888083333333">
Zaliznjak’s dictionary, both in its book form and
electronic version, has proved an invaluable tool.
In this paper we have shown how the classes from
Zaliznjak can be mapped into a DATR representa-
tion. This representation is a structured lexicon
from which we can derive all of the associated
forms for the entries in Zaliznjak. As well as con-
stituting a valuable computation resource for Rus-
sian in its own right, our next step will be to use
this lexical database as the foundation for high
quality lemmatization and morphosyntactic tag-
ging software for Russian text.

<abstract confidence="0.9591171875">In this paper we describe the mapping of Zaliznjak’s (1977) morphological classes into the lexical representation language DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1996). On the basis of the resulting DATR theory a set of fully inflected forms together with their associated morphosyntax can automatically be generated from the electronic version of Zaliznjak’s dictionary (Ilola and Mustajoki 1989). From this data we plan to develop a wide-coverage morphosyntactic lemmatizer and tagger for Russian. Our goal is to undertake a detailed corpus analysis of Russian texts, focusing on the relationship between morphological ambiguity (syncretism) in nouns and adjectives and the comparative frequency of the relevant grammatical categories. For this purpose, we will use two corpora, the Uppsala corpus (Lönngren 1993, Maier 1994) and a corpus of Russian newspaper texts from the late 1990’s, for which we require detailed morphosyntactic annotation. However, suitably annotated versions of these corpora are not yet freely available and corpus analysis tools for Russian in general are We have chosen, therefore, to develop our own lemmatization and tagging technology, based on electronic version of Zaliznjak’s (1977) dic- 1For an indication of what is available see: For natural language processing of Slavic languages in general see for example work on the MULTEXT-EAST project by Dimitrova, Erjavec, Ide, Kaalep, Tufis (1998) and work within the INTEX system by Vitas (2001).</abstract>

In this paper we describe the first step in this process: mapping the basic Zaliznjak data into a hierarchical lexical database implemented in DATR. 1.1 The Zaliznjak dictionary Zaliznjak (1977) is a reverse dictionary in book form, dealing primarily with Russian inflectional morphology. For each of the almost 100,000 lexical entries, indexes refer the reader to declension types and conjugations, together with stress patterns. Other symbols indicate subregularities and irregularities. As the dictionary uses such indicators, it gives explicit information about every inflectional form and stress. Ilola and Mustajoki (1989: 1-5) describe how the material was adapted for computer use. Zaliznjak&apos;s dictionary has been the starting point for a number of applications. Anciaux (1991) made use of it in the creation of a spell-checker for Russian, and Pavlova, Pavlov, Sproat, Shih and van Santen (1997) used the electronic version to create language-specific tables to fit into the modular architecture of the Bell Laboratories Text-to-Speech system. Brown, Corbett and Fraser (1995) and Brown, Hippisley, Corbett and Fraser (1995) created a DATR lexicon of the 1500 most frequent noun lexemes from Zasorina (1977). The derived forms from this inheritance-based lexicon were all checked manually against Zaliznjak. The forms are represented in a phonological transcription, together with stress information (Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley and Timberlake 1996). An updated version of this lexicon was used in Brown (1998) to compare different morphological theories. 1.2 Outline The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the general principles of the mapping and examples. In Section 3, we discuss the technical framework of our approach and the issues and problems that arise. In Section 4 we discuss the current status of the mapping and principal areas for further development including our approach to lemmatization and tagging. Section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Mapping Zaliznjak into DATR 2.1 The overall approach In book form, Zaliznjak’s dictionary has two parts. The first is a set of tables identifying morphosyntactic classes and defining the realization of morphological features with them. The second is a listing of lexical entries, each followed by an index referring to a table in the first part which gives the paradigm for this particular For example, the word shade&apos; is a masculine noun of type 1A and as follows the inflectional pattern of ‘factory’ which is given as the example paradigm for masculine nouns of type 1A. М 1A Sg nom gen dat acc instr loc Pl nom gen dat acc instr loc Table 1. Zaliznjak’s paradigm for masculine inanimate nouns of type 1A. The electronic form contains just the set of lexical entries (101401 lines, 98729 lexical entries). Thus our mapping process has two distinct components: 1. manual construction of a DATR representation of the morphosyntactic class and realization information from the printed paradigm tables; 2. automatic construction of the individual lexical entries from the electronic dictionary data. In practice we also introduce a third component, interfacing between the morphosyntactic classes and the automatic entries. As we discuss below, this gives us increased flexibility in the way we interpret the Zaliznjak data. The information in Zaliznjak&apos;s dictionary includes a fair number of subregular and idiosyncratic cases. The target representation, DATR, is specifically designed to support such situations, providing concise representation of hierarchically organized lexicons containing generalizations and exceptions. We have already a formal theoretical model of Russian morphology (Corbett and Fraser 1993; Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley and Timberlake 1996; Brown 1998) which underlies our approach. In addition, as we have a frequency based resource to check against (Brown, Corbett and Fraser 1995; Brown, Hippisley, Corbett and Fraser 1995), we are in a good position to check the accuracy of our automatic creation of lexical entries for the high frequency, least regular cases. The same framework can also be used to capture generalisations across languages (cf. Cahill and Gazdar 1999; Tiberius 2001), but this is not our current goal. 2.2 The hand-crafted realization component Zaliznjak does not use the traditional division of words into declension types in his dictionary, but divides nouns into types according to the last grapheme of the stem. (Ilola and Mustajoki 1989:9) For example, he distinguishes eight types masculine nouns numbered These morphological types are then further divided according to stress. The masculine noun types can occur with six different stress patterns indicated by subcatego- Thus the most basic masculine noun might be named 3C, Special characters are used to further characterize the different morphological types. For instance, with an the presence of a fleeting such as in (husband’s which has the instrumental Animacy is indicated in combination with gender, so a class such as 1*A masculine, animate, type 1, stress pattern A with a fleeting vowel. This information for each lexical entry is used to refer to a table at the beginning of the dictionary which gives an example of the inflectional forms. These tables form the basis of a hand-crafted DATR theory in which each type is represented by a node in the DATR inheritance hierarchy. This results in a hierarchical structure of noun classes, part of which is shown here: NOMINAL NOUN NOUN_MO NOUN_F . . NOUN_M_1A Figure 1. Extract of the DATR hierarchy In each node, definitions of morphosyntactic realizations specific to that noun class are given. Information that is shared between (or default for) classes is inherited from the parent node. A small of the theory is provided NOMINAL: &lt;mor&gt; == &amp;quot;&lt;stem&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;mor suffix&gt;&amp;quot;. 2The DATR code is slightly simplified for expository purposes. Note that the code is written to reflect Zaliznjak’s system. The main goal has not been elegance and economy of representation. For theoretically-driven inheritance representations of Russian morphology using DATR see Corbett and Fraser (1993), Fraser and Corbett (1995), and Brown (1998). NOUN: &lt;&gt; == NOMINAL suffix pl dat&gt; == suffix pl instr&gt; == suffix pl loc&gt; == NOUN_M: &lt;&gt; == NOUN &lt;syn gender&gt; == masculine &lt;syn animacy&gt; == inanimate. NOUN_M_1A: &lt;&gt; == NOUN_M &lt;mor suffix sg nom&gt; == Null suffix sg gen&gt; == suffix sg dat&gt; == &lt;mor suffix sg acc&gt; == &amp;quot;&lt;mor suffix sg nom&gt;&amp;quot; suffix sg instr&gt; == suffix sg loc&gt; == suffix pl nom&gt; == suffix pl gen&gt; == &lt;mor suffix pl acc&gt; == &amp;quot;&lt;mor suffix pl nom&gt;&amp;quot;. the morphotactics of Russian nominals (nouns and adjectives), comprising a stem followed by a suffix that realizes the morphofeatures. this definition and defines three plural suffixes that are generally between nouns, specific synfeatures and finally out the of the possible suffixes. Notice that is not defined in this theory – it will be determined on a per-lexical entry basis from the automatically generated entries described below. Notice also the syncretic definitions for suffixes associated with acc acc terms of their nominative counterparts for inanimate nouns – for a more detailed discussion of the techniques used for representing such a syncretism, see Corbett and Fraser (1993:131) and Brown (1998:154-155). Classes of feminine and neuter nouns are handled similarly; for feminine nouns, eight types and nine different stress patterns are identified, whereas for neuter nouns eight types and six stress patterns are distinguished. In addition, most of these types are found with both animate and inanimate nouns, and in the DATR theory, two noun classes are distinguished for each type occurring with both animate and inanimate nouns. In total about 100 different noun classes are distinguished per gender in the DATR theory. In order to make use of this theory, a lexical entry needs to inherit from the node representing its noun class and provide the specific morphotactic elements associated with the class. So for example, possible definition for shade&apos; might be: &lt;&gt; == NOUN_M_1A == From this definition, plus the preceding example fragment, the standard inference rules of DATR allow all the relevant inflectional forms to be derived: sg nom&gt; = sg gen&gt; = а sg dat&gt; = у sg acc&gt; = sg instr&gt; = ом sg loc&gt; = е pl nom&gt; = ы pl gen&gt; = ов pl dat&gt; = ам pl acc&gt; = ы pl instr&gt; = ами pl loc&gt; = ах. Note that stress is not currently indicated in the derived forms. Our research involves the morphosyntactic analysis of written text which generally does not mark stress. However, as the distinctions related to stress that are made in Zaliznjak (1977) have been kept in the DATR theory, the stress patterns can easily be used in our analysis of syncretism and frequency. 2.3 Automatic generation of lexical entries In its electronic form, Zaliznjak represents each lexical entry as a text string of the sort given here the word shade&apos;: М Here, the first item is the (uppercase) citation form of the word, the second is a line identifier (line 01 of 01 lines), the third is the word annotated with stress information, the fourth is gender/animacy information and the fifth morphological type. However, inevitably, many of the entries are more complex than this in various ways: 1. Entries can spread over several lines, requiring textual concatenation of just the parts following the line identifier information to build the complete entry. 2. Where inflectional class does not correspond to gender/animacy, it may be specified separately between angle brackets. For ‘grandfather’ is a masculine noun which declines as a feminine noun of type 3*A. 3. Alternative values for stress patterns and sometimes classes may be present between square brackets. 4. Additional annotations indicate second locative, second genitive, pluralia tantum, irregular forms, etc. 5. Additional comments may be present enclosed in parentheses. 6. Other punctuation (commas etc.) may or may not be present. In order to deliver lexical entry information in the form required by the hand-crafted theory, this data needs to be parsed and interpreted into the kind of format we saw above. A standard approach to this task is to use regular expression search and substitute commands to incrementally rewrite the data strings into a more uniform format and ultimately into the required input. However, DATR itself also provides powerful string-rewriting functionality, particularly suited for dealing with awkward exceptional cases, but less efficient for more routine rewriting. The approach we have taken strikes a balance between these two technologies. Initially we use regular expression rewriting to achieve a basic parse of the input data: joining multiple lines together, removing duplicate spaces, isolating various bracketed expressions, parsing the remaining fields and finally mapping into a DATR definition for each entry. However this DATR definition is very surface-oriented – little more than a basic segmentation of the input data. This process can be carried out completely automatically with a fairly high accuracy. But in order to link such entries to the core morphological classes, further interpretation of the data fields identified is necessary, and this is achieved dynamically in DATR. For example, a typical simple lexical entry is the aristocrat’. Its entry in Zaliznjak is: XO In the first phase of processing, this is mapped via regular expression search and substitute into a DATR node definition as follows: &lt;&gt; == ZALNODE &lt;index&gt; == 30 &lt;src txt&gt; == &apos; ... &apos; &lt;src cit&gt; == &lt;src str&gt; == &lt;src gen&gt; == &lt;src cls&gt; == This node is an instance of the predefined node index number 30 (meaning simply it was the node to be processed in this The txt&gt; (omitted due to lack of space) is the whole original source string, and the other features provide the key components the entry citation, stressed, class). This is the ‘surface level’ representation of the entry. The DATR node interprets this information to define implicitly a ‘deep’ representation as required by the morphological classes, roughly equivalent to this: &lt;&gt; == NOUN_FO_3*A == == Here, the gender/animacy and class information have been combined (and transliterated to Latin script) to determine the declension class for this form. The stem forms for this class have been determined from the citation form (the morphotactic for what components are required – different from the simabove, to allow for the possible insertion of a fleeting vowel). not actually create a new node definition for the deep representation. Rather, appropriate values for deep features are calculated dynamically when the declension class code requests them, by rewriting and transforming the values provided by the surface form definitions. The overall effect is that, just as we saw previously, the declension class definitions can use this information to provide the syntax and all the inflected forms for this word: &lt;syn gender&gt; = feminine &lt;syn animacy&gt; = animate sg nom&gt; = K a sg gen&gt; = K K sg dat&gt; = K e sg acc&gt; = K y sg instr&gt; = K oK sg loc&gt; = K e pl nom&gt; = K K pl gen&gt; = o K pl dat&gt; = K am pl acc&gt; = o K pl instr&gt; = K amK pl loc&gt; = K For most of these forms the inflection follows the of Notice, however, that in the genitive and accusaplural forms, a fleeting vowel, this case, is inserted between these two components. An example of a more complex lexical entry is which is a masculine animate noun of type 5*A. This noun has a fleeting vowel appears in the nominative singular The writing system also indicates the presence of the phoneme /j/ by the of the other case and number combinations. To deal with this allomorphy, the DATR two values for the ‘deep’ representation of this lexical entry, one which is used in the nominasingular, i.e. and one which is used for other cases, i.e. The ‘deep’ representafor roughly like this: &lt;&gt; == NOUN_MO_5*A 1&gt; == == == 3 The technical framework The key technical challenge of this exercise was actually rather mundane: we needed to find an environment or set of environments that would allow us to do all the processing required (manual editing, regular expression search and substitute, DATR compilation and dumping) with data that included both Latin and Cyrillic script. In addition, we wanted the resources we created to be maximally reusable in other contexts, so a solution in line with agreed standards was highly desirable. To achieve these goals, we adopted Unicode as the standard representation for all our data, and identified or adapted tools to work with data in that form. Furthermore we used the simplest encoding of Unicode in data files, the “ucs2” encoding, which stores each 16 bit Unicode character simply as two bytes of data. This is not as compact as other encodings (such as “utf8”) but is supported by a wider range of applications, in particular Microsoft Wordpad. 3.1 A Unicode version of Zaliznjak It is a fairly straightforward task to convert the transliteration used in the electronic form of Zaliznjak to Unicode Cyrillic, using Microsoft Word macros. Disambiguation of the hard and soft signs is required for the first field, (the index word field), as the + character is used for both symbols. However, the third field differentiates the hard and soft sign and, as the number of lexical items written with a hard sign is not great, it is a trivial task to check these. The resulting files are then saved as plain text (ie “ucs2”) Unicode files. 3.2 DATR and Unicode The DATR compiler used for this project was the Sussex/Brighton DATR compiler, which is written in Prolog. The DATR compiler inherits its character-level processing from the underlying Prolog compiler, so in order to process Unicode DATR it was simply necessary to run it in a Prolog system capable of handling Unicode, and modify it slightly to detect when it was given a Unicode file input. This was achieved using Poplog plus a customized version of Sussex/Brighton DATR (soon to be released as version 2.10). This version also includes new support for batch mode processing of DATR theories and a number of compiler enhancements for compiling larger DATR theories. 3.3 Editing and search and substitute in Unicode Unicode files stored in “ucs2” encoding can be conveniently viewed and edited using Microsoft Word or Wordpad, the latter being more straightforward for the simple text-editing requirements of most of the data files involved here. The automatic rewriting of Zaliznjak entries required a more sophisticated regular expression engine, which we obtained by adapting the Poplog editor’s regular expression functionality to work with Unicode. These functions are particularly powerful in allowing multi-line regular expression matching, so that one can match patterns spanning several lines (such as Zaliznjak data continuation lines) and rewrite them to a single line. Limited manual editing of Unicode using the Poplog editor is also possible: it can manipulate arbitrary Unicode data, but its ability to display non-Latin data is platform dependent, and on our platform (Windows 2000) all the Cyrillic characters were displayed as ‘?’. 4 Current status and future work The system described in this paper is still very much work-in-progress. The core technologies and support is only available in version 15.53, although currently it is completely undocumented. structures of the approach have been developed and validated as a viable approach. Population and validation of the data is an on-going process, the current state of which can be summarized as follows: 1. The hand-crafted DATR theory for Zaliznjak’s morphological classes has been completed for the noun classes, with adjective classes next to be done. Other classes are lower priority for the present project. 2. Automatic compilation of all 98729 Zanliznjak entries into ‘surface’ DATR nodes is complete but not validated. 3. Processing of a sample set containing 2062 entries has been undertaken with the following (not fully validated) results: No. of Zaliznjak entries 2062 100% No. of DATR nodes 2000 97% Nodes identified as nouns 1192 60% Nouns successfully classified 1066 89% Principal areas for further development include: 1. Completion and validation of noun entries 2. Extension to adjectives (and possibly verbs) 3. Integration of data from the manually validated lexicon of 1500 most frequent nouns, to improve accuracy, particular for irregular forms. 4. Development of a lemmatizer and tagger for Russian using this data.</abstract>

Brown, Corbett and Fraser (1995) and Brown, Hippisley, Corbett and Fraser (1995) created a DATR lexicon of the 1500 most frequent noun lexemes from Zasorina (1977). The derived forms from this inheritance-based lexicon were all checked manually against Zaliznjak. The forms are represented in a phonological transcription, together with stress information (Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley and Timberlake 1996). An updated version of this lexicon was used in Brown (1998) to compare different morphological theories. 1.2 Outline The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the general principles of the mapping and examples. In Section 3, we discuss the technical framework of our approach and the issues and problems that arise. In Section 4 we discuss the current status of the mapping and principal areas for further development including our approach to lemmatization and tagging. Section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Mapping Zaliznjak into DATR 2.1 The overall approach In book form, Zaliznjak’s dictionary has two parts. The first is a set of tables identif</context>

As we discuss below, this gives us increased flexibility in the way we interpret the Zaliznjak data. The information in Zaliznjak&apos;s dictionary includes a fair number of subregular and idiosyncratic cases. The target representation, DATR, is specifically designed to support such situations, providing concise representation of hierarchically organized lexicons containing generalizations and exceptions. We have already a formal theoretical model of Russian morphology (Corbett and Fraser 1993; Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley and Timberlake 1996; Brown 1998) which underlies our approach. In addition, as we have a frequency based resource to check against (Brown, Corbett and Fraser 1995; Brown, Hippisley, Corbett and Fraser 1995), we are in a good position to check the accuracy of our automatic creation of lexical entries for the high frequency, least regular cases. The same framework can also be used to capture generalisations across languages (cf. Cahill and Gazdar 1999; Tiberius 2001), but this is not our current goal. 2.2 The hand-crafted realization component Zaliznjak does not use the traditional division of words into declension types in hi</context>

A small fragment of the theory is provided here:2 NOMINAL: &lt;mor&gt; == &amp;quot;&lt;stem&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;mor suffix&gt;&amp;quot;. 2 The DATR code is slightly simplified for expository purposes. Note that the code is written to reflect Zaliznjak’s system. The main goal has not been elegance and economy of representation.

From this data we plan to develop a wide-coverage morphosyntactic lemmatizer and tagger for Russian. 1 Introduction Our goal is to undertake a detailed corpus analysis of Russian texts, focusing on the relationship between morphological ambiguity (syncretism) in nouns and adjectives and the comparative frequency of the relevant grammatical categories. For this purpose, we will use two corpora, the Uppsala corpus (Lönngren 1993, Maier 1994) and a corpus of Russian newspaper texts from the late 1990’s, for which we require detailed morphosyntactic annotation. However, suitably annotated versions of these corpora are not yet freely available and corpus analysis tools for Russian in general are scarce.1 We have chosen, therefore, to develop our own lemmatization and tagging technology, based on the electronic version of Zaliznjak’s (1977) dic1 For an indication of what is available see: http://talrusse.free.fr.

Cahill and Gazdar 1999; Tiberius 2001), but this is not our current goal. 2.2 The hand-crafted realization component Zaliznjak does not use the traditional division of words into declension types in his dictionary, but divides nouns into types according to the last grapheme of the stem. (Ilola and Mustajoki 1989:9) For example, he distinguishes eight types for masculine nouns numbered 1 to 8. These morphological types are then further divided according to stress. The masculine noun types can occur with six different stress patterns indicated by subcategories A to F. Thus the most basic masculine noun classes might be named M 1A, M</context>

For each of the almost 100,000 lexical entries, indexes refer the reader to declension types and conjugations, together with stress patterns. Other symbols indicate subregularities and irregularities. As the dictionary uses such indicators, it gives explicit information about every inflectional form and stress. Ilola and Mustajoki (1989: 1-5) describe how the material was adapted for computer use. Zaliznjak&apos;s dictionary has been the starting point for a number of applications.

Note that stress is not currently indicated in the derived forms. Our research involves the morphosyntactic analysis of written text which generally does not mark stress. However, as the distinctions related to stress that are made in Zaliznjak (1977) have been kept in the DATR theory, the stress patterns can easily be used in our analysis of syncretism and frequency. 2.3 Automatic generation of lexical entries In its electronic form, Zaliznjak represents each lexical entry as a text string of the sort given here for the word a6aocyp &apos;lamp shade&apos;: АБАЖУР 0101 АБАЖ&lt;УР М 1А Here, the first item is the (uppercase) citation form of the word, the second is a line identifier (line 01 of 01 lines), the third is the word annotated with stress information, the fourth is gender/animacy information and the fifth morphological type.

Zaliznjak&apos;s dictionary has been the starting point for a number of applications. Anciaux (1991) made use of it in the creation of a spell-checker for Russian, and Pavlova, Pavlov, Sproat, Shih and van Santen (1997) used the electronic version to create language-specific tables to fit into the modular architecture of the Bell Laboratories Text-to-Speech system. Brown, Corbett and Fraser (1995) and Brown, Hippisley, Corbett and Fraser (1995) created a DATR lexicon of the 1500 most frequent noun lexemes from Zasorina (1977). The derived forms from this inheritance-based lexicon were all checked manually against Zaliznjak. The forms are represented in a phonological transcription, together with stress information (Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley and Timberlake 1996). An updated version of this lexicon was used in Brown (1998) to compare different morphological theories. 1.2 Outline The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the general principles of the mapping and examples. In Section 3, we discuss the technical framework of our approach and the issues and problems that arise.
