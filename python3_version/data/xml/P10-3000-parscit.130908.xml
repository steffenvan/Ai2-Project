We are pleased to present the papers accepted for presentation at the Student Research Workshop of
the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics held in Uppsala, Sweden,
July 11-16, 2010. The Student Research Workshop, an established tradition at the annual meetings of
ACL, offers students the opportunity to present their work in a setting embedded in the main conference
and features ACL’s efforts to invest in young researchers who will be a part of the research community
in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and related fields in the near future. The
workshop aimed at enabling students to exchange ideas with other researchers and experts and to receive
useful feedback and directions for future research in an early stage of their work.
We are indebted to many people who contributed to the organization of the ACL 2010 Student Research
Workshop. A total of 54 students and senior researchers agreed to serve on the program committee, of
which 21 were from North America, 24 were from Europe, 2 were from Middle East, and 7 were from
Asia/Pacific regions. The committee members, who represented various areas of NLP and computational
linguistics research, well understood the spirit of the Student Research Workshop and provided high-
quality, constructive, and elaborate reviews to all students who submitted their work. We are thankful to
the members of the program committee for the time they spent reading and reviewing the papers.
We received 37 submissions from all over the world. Each submission was assigned to 3 reviewers, at
least one of which was a senior researcher. We accepted 7 submissions for oral and poster presentation
and 12 submissions for only poster presentation during a parallel session with the main conference. The
presentation format was assigned based on the suggestions of the reviewers about how the work could
be presented best, and does not indicate a quality difference among accepted papers. We would like to
thank all students who contributed to the success of this years Student Research Workshop by submitting
their research papers from a wide range of topics.
We are very grateful to Tomek Strzalkowski and Marketa Lopatkova, our tireless faculty advisors, for
their advice, constant support, and obtaining funding. We also would like to thank the conference
organizers of ACL’2010: the general chair, Jan Hajic, the program chairs, Sandra Carberry and Stephen
Clark, the publications chairs Jing-Shin Chang and Philipp Koehn, and the local organization committee
in particular Joakim Nivre, and Priscilla Rasmussen.
Finally, we wish to thank the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), The Don and Betty Walker
Student Scholarship Fund of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and European Chapter of
the ACL (EACL) for generously sponsoring this workshop by offering grants to assist presenters in
covering their registration, accommodation, and travel costs.
