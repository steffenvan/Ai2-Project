This paper proposes a new discriminative
training method in constructing phrase and
lexicon translation models. In order to
reliably learn a myriad of parameters in
these models, we propose an expected
BLEU score-based utility function with KL
regularization as the objective, and train the
models on a large parallel dataset. For
training, we derive growth transformations
for phrase and lexicon translation
probabilities to iteratively improve the
objective. The proposed method, evaluated
on the Europarl German-to-English dataset,
leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement
over a state-of-the-art baseline translation
system. In IWSLT 2011 Benchmark, our
system using the proposed method achieves
the best Chinese-to-English translation
result on the task of translating TED talks.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99994075925926">
Discriminative training is an active area in
statistical machine translation (SMT) (e.g., Och et
al., 2002, 2003, Liang et al., 2006, Blunsom et al.,
2008, Chiang et al., 2009, Foster et al, 2010, Xiao
et al. 2011). Och (2003) proposed using a log-
linear model to incorporate multiple features for
translation, and proposed a minimum error rate
training (MERT) method to train the feature
weights to optimize a desirable translation metric.
While the log-linear model itself is
discriminative, the phrase and lexicon translation
features, which are among the most important
components of SMT, are derived from either
generative models or heuristics (Koehn et al.,
2003, Brown et al., 1993). Moreover, the
parameters in the phrase and lexicon translation
models are estimated by relative frequency or
maximizing joint likelihood, which may not
correspond closely to the translation measure, e.g.,
bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) (Papineni
et al., 2002). Therefore, it is desirable to train all
these parameters to directly maximize an objective
that directly links to translation quality.
However, there are a large number of
parameters in these models, making discriminative
training for them non-trivial (e.g., Liang et al.,
2006, Chiang et al., 2009). Liang et al. (2006)
proposed a large set of lexical and Part-of-Speech
features and trained the model weights associated
with these features using perceptron. Since many
of the reference translations are non-reachable, an
empirical local updating strategy had to be devised
to fix this problem by picking a pseudo reference.
Many such non-desirable heuristics led to
moderate gains reported in that work. Chiang et al.
(2009) improved a syntactic SMT system by
adding as many as ten thousand syntactic features,
and used Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm
(MIRA) to train the feature weights. However, the
number of parameters in common phrase and
lexicon translation models is much larger.
In this work, we present a new, highly effective
discriminative learning method for phrase and
lexicon translation models. The training objective
is an expected BLEU score, which is closely linked
to translation quality. Further, we apply a
Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence regularization
to prevent over-fitting.
For effective optimization, we derive updating
formulas of growth transformation (GT) for phrase
and lexicon translation probabilities. A GT is a
transformation of the probabilities that guarantees
strict non-decrease of the objective over each GT
iteration unless a local maximum is reached. A

similar GT technique has been successfully used in
speech recognition (Gopalakrishnan et al., 1991,
Povey, 2004, He et al., 2008). Our work
demonstrates that it works with large scale
discriminative training of SMT model as well.
Our work is based on a phrase-based SMT
system. Experiments on the Europarl German-to-
English dataset show that the proposed method
leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a
strong baseline. The proposed method is also
successfully evaluated on the IWSLT 2011
benchmark test set, where the task is to translate
TED talks (www.ted.com). Our experimental
results on this open-domain spoken language
translation task show that the proposed method
leads to significant translation performance
improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline, and
the system using the proposed method achieved the
best single system translation result in the Chinese-
to-English MT track.

One best known approach in discriminative
training for SMT is proposed by Och (2003). In
that work, multiple features, most of them are
derived from generative models, are incorporated
into a log-linear model, and the relative weights of
them are tuned discriminatively on a small tuning
set. However, in practice, this approach only works
with a handful of parameters.
More closely related to our work, Liang et al.
(2006) proposed a large set of lexical and Part-of-
Speech features in addition to the phrase
translation model. Weights of these features are
trained using perceptron on a training set of 67K
sentences. In that paper, the authors pointed out
that forcing the model to update towards the
reference translation could be problematic. This is
because the hidden structure such as phrase
segmentation and alignment could be abused if the
system is forced to produce a reference translation.
Therefore, instead of pushing the parameter update
towards the reference translation (a.k.a. bold
updating), the author proposed a local updating
strategy where the model parameters are updated
towards a pseudo-reference (i.e., the hypothesis in
the n-best list that gives the best BLEU score).
Experimental results showed that their approach
outperformed a baseline by 0.8 BLEU point when
using monotonic decoding, but there was no
significant gain over a stronger baseline with a
full-distortion model. In our work, we use the
expectation of BLEU scores as the objective. This
avoids the heuristics of picking the updating
reference and therefore gives a more principal way
of setting the training objective.
As another closely related study, Chiang et al.
(2009) incorporated about ten thousand syntactic
features in addition to the baseline features. The
feature weights are trained on a tuning set with
2010 sentences using MIRA. In our work, we have
many more parameters to train, and the training is
conducted on the entire training corpora. Our GT
based optimization algorithm is highly
parallelizable and efficient, which is the key for
large scale discriminative training.
As a further related work, Rosti et al. (2011)
have proposed using differentiable expected BLEU
score as the objective to train system combination
parameters. Other work related to the computation
of expected BLEU in common with ours includes
minimum Bayes risk approaches (Smith and Eisner
2006, Tromble et al., 2008) and lattice-based
MERT (Macherey et al., 2008). In these earlier work,
however, the phrase and lexicon translation models
used remained unchanged.
Another line of research that is closely related to
our work is phrase table refinement and pruning.
Wuebker et al. (2010) proposed a method to train
the phrase translation model using Expectation-
Maximization algorithm with a leave-one-out
strategy. The parallel sentences were forced to be
aligned at the phrase level using the phrase table
and other features as in a decoding process. Then
the phrase translation probabilities were estimated
based on the phrase alignments. To prevent
overfitting, the statistics of phrase pairs from a
particular sentence was excluded from the phrase
table when aligning that sentence. However, as
pointed out by Liang et al (2006), the same
problem as in the bold updating existed, i.e., forced
alignment between a source sentence and its
reference translation was tricky, and the proposed
alignment was likely to be unreliable. The method
presented in this paper is free from this problem.

In translation, the input sentence is segmented

phrase (FP) translation feature is scored as:
where 𝑒k and 𝑓k are the k-th phrase in E and F,
respectively. The target-to-source (backward)
phrase translation model is defined similarly.
where 𝑒k,m is the m-th word of the k-th target
phrase 𝑒k, 𝑓k,r is the r-th word in the k-th source
phrase 𝑓k, and 𝑝(𝑒k,m|𝑓k,r) is the probability of
translating word 𝑓k,r to word 𝑒k,1T1. In IBM model
1, these probabilities are learned via maximizing a
joint likelihood between the source and target
sentences. The target-to-source (backward) lexicon
translation model is defined similarly.

In a phrase-based SMT system, the total number
of parameters of phrase and lexicon translation
models, which we aim to learn discriminatively, is
very large (see Table 1). Therefore, regularization
is critical to prevent over-fitting. In this work, we
regularize the parameters with KL regularization.
KL divergence is commonly used to measure
the distance between two probability distributions.
For the whole parameter set 𝛉 , the KL
regularization is defined in this work as the sum of

this GT. Gopalakrishnan et al. (1991) extended the

In evaluating the proposed method, we use two

<bodyText confidence="0.999736">
In evaluating the proposed method, we use two
separate datasets. First, we conduct experiments on
the Europarl German-to-English dataset. The
training corpus contains 751K sentence pairs, 21
words per sentence on average. 2000 sentences are
provided in the development set. We use the first
1000 sentences for 𝛌 tuning, and the rest for
validation. The test set consists of 2000 sentences.

To build the baseline phrase-based SMT system,
we first perform word alignment on the training set
using a hidden Markov model with lexicalized
distortion (He 2007), then extract the phrase table
from the word aligned bilingual texts (Koehn et al.,
2003). The maximum phrase length is set to four.
Other models used in the baseline system include
lexicalized ordering model, word count and phrase
count, and a 3-gram LM trained on the English
side of the parallel training corpus. Feature weights
are tuned by MERT. A fast beam-search phrase-
based decoder (Moore and Quirk 2007) is used and
the distortion limit is set to four. Details of the
phrase and lexicon translation models are given in
Table 1. This baseline achieves a BLEU score of
26.22% on the test set. This baseline system is also
used to generate a 100-best list of the training
corpus during maximum expected BLEU training.

During training, we first tune the regularization
factor τ based on the performance on the validation
set. For simplicity reasons, the tuning of τ makes
use of only the phrase translation models. Table 2
reports the BLEU scores and gains over the
baseline given different values of τ. The results
highlight the importance of regularization. While τ
= 5×10-5 gives the best score on the validation
set, the gain is shown to be substantially reduced to
merely 0.2 BLEU point when τ = 0, i.e., no
regularization. We set the optimal value of τ =
5×10-5 in all remaining experiments.

between the two is important in justifying our use
of the former as the training objective. Fig. 2
shows these two scores on the training set over
training iterations. Since the expected BLEU is
affected by λ strongly, we fix the value of λ in
order to make the expected BLEU comparable
across different iterations. From Fig. 2 it is clear
that the expected BLEU score correlates strongly

Next, we study the effects of training the phrase
translation probabilities and the lexicon translation
probabilities according to the GT formulas
presented in the preceding section. The break-
down results are shown in Table 3. Compared with
the baseline, training phrase or lexicon models
alone gives a gain of 0.7 and 0.5 BLEU points,
respectively, on the test set. For a full training of
both phrase and lexicon models, we adopt two
learning schedules: update both models together at
each iteration (simultaneously), or update them in
two stages (two-stage), where the phrase models
are trained first until reaching the best score on the
validation set and then the lexicon models are
trained. Both learning schedules give significant
improvements over the baseline and also over
training phrase or lexicon models alone. The two-
stage training of both models gives the best result
of 27.33%, outperforming the baseline by 1.1
BLEU points.
More detail of the two-stage training is provided
in Fig. 3, where BLEU scores in each stage are
shown as a function of the GT training iteration.
The phrase translation probabilities (PT) are
trained alone in the first stage, shown in blue color.
After five iterations, the BLEU score on the
validation set reaches the peak value, with further
iteration giving BLEU score fluctuation. Hence,
we perform lexicon model (LEX) training starting
from the sixth iteration with the corresponding
BLEU scores shown in red color in Fig. 3. The
BLEU score is further improved by 0.4 points after
additional three iterations of training the lexicon
models. In total, nine iterations are performed to
comalete the two-stage GT training of all phrase
and Nxicon models.

5.3 Experiments on the IWSLT2011 benchmark
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933733333334">
As the second evaluation task, we apply our new
method described in this paper to the 2011 IWSLT
Chinese-to-English machine translation benchmark
(Federico et al., 2011). The main focus of the
IWSLT2011 Evaluation is the translation of TED
talks (www.ted.com). These talks are originally
given in English. In the Chinese-to-English
translation task, we are provided with human
translated Chinese text with punctuations inserted.
The goal is to match the human transcribed English
speech with punctuations.
This is an open-domain spoken language
translation task. The training data consist of 110K
sentences in the transcripts of the TED talks and
their translations, in English and Chinese,
respectively. Each sentence consists of 20 words
on average. Two development sets are provided,
namely, dev2010 and tst2010. They consist of 934
sentences and 1664 sentences, respectively. We
use dev2010 for λ tuning and tst2010 for
validation. The test set tst2011 consists of 1450
sentences.
In our system, a primary phrase table is trained
from the 110K TED parallel training data, and a 3-
gram LM is trained on the English side of the
parallel data. We are also provided additional out-
of-domain data for potential usage. From them, we
train a secondary 5-gram LM on 115M sentences
of supplementary English data, and a secondary
phrase table from 500K sentences selected from
the supplementary UN corpus by the method
proposed by Axelrod et al. (2011).
In carrying out the maximum expected BLEU
training, we use 100-best list and tune the
regularization factor to the optimal value of τ =
1×10-5. We only train the parameters of the
primary phrase table. The secondary phrase table
and LM are excluded from the training process
since the out-of-domain phrase table is less
relevant to the TED translation task, and the large
LM slows down the N-best generation process
significantly.
At the end, we perform one final MERT to tune
the relative weights with all features including the
secondary phrase table and LM.
The translation results are presented in Table 4.
The baseline is a phrase-based system with all
features including the secondary phrase table and
LM. The new system uses the same features except
that the primary phrase table is discriminatively
trained using maximum expected-BLEU and GT
optimization as described earlier in this paper.
The results are obtained using the two-stage
training schedule, including six iterations for
training phrase translation models and two
iterations for training lexicon translation models.
The results in Table 4 show that the proposed
method leads to an improvement of 1.2 BLEU
point over the baseline. This gives the best single
system result on this task.

<bodyText confidence="0.999989576923077">
The contributions of this work can be summarized
as follows. First, we propose a new objective
function (Eq. 9) for training of large-scale
translation models, including phrase and lexicon
models, with more parameters than all previous
methods have attempted. The objective function
consists of 1) the utility function of expected
BLEU score, and 2) the regularization term taking
the form of KL divergence in the parameter space.
The expected BLEU score is closely linked to
translation quality and the regularization is
essential when many parameters are trained at
scale. The importance of both is verified
experimentally with the results presented in this
paper.
Second, through non-trivial derivation, we show
that the novel objective function of Eq. (9) is
amenable to iterative GT updates, where each
update is equipped with a closed-form formula.
Third, the new objective function and new
optimization technique are successfully applied to
two important machine translation tasks, with
implementation issues resolved (e.g., training
schedule and hyper-parameter tuning, etc.). The
superior results clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Introduction Discriminative training is an active area in statistical machine translation (SMT) (e.g., Och et al., 2002, 2003, Liang et al., 2006, Blunsom et al., 2008, Chiang et al., 2009, Foster et al, 2010, Xiao et al. 2011). Och (2003) proposed using a loglinear model to incorporate multiple features for translation, and proposed a minimum error rate training (MERT) method to train the feature weights to optimize a desirable translation metric. While the log-linear model itself is discriminative, the phrase and lexicon translation features, which are among the most important components of SMT, are derived from either generative models or heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003, Brown et al., 1993).

Moreover, the parameters in the phrase and lexicon translation models are estimated by relative frequency or maximizing joint likelihood, which may not correspond closely to the translation measure, e.g., bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) (Papineni et al., 2002). Therefore, it is desirable to train all these parameters to directly maximize an objective that directly links to translation quality.

Phrase-based Translation System The translation process of phrase-based SMT can be briefly described in three steps: segment source sentence into a sequence of phrases, translate each 293 source phrase to a target phrase, re-order target phrases into target sentence (Koehn et al., 2003). In decoding, the optimal translation 𝐸 given the source sentence F is obtained according to where 3.2.

We use the word translation table from IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) and compute the sum over all possible word alignments within a phrase pair without normalizing for length (Quirk et al., 2005). The source-to-target forward lexicon (FL) translation feature is: ℎFL 𝐸, 𝐹 = 𝑝 𝑒k,m 𝑓k,r 1 𝑍 𝑒𝑥𝑝 𝜆mlog ℎm(𝐸, 𝐹) 𝑃𝐸𝐹= 𝐸 = argmax E 𝑃 𝐸 𝐹 (1) (2) (5) and 𝑍= E 𝑒𝑥𝑝 m 𝜆mlog ℎm(𝐸, 𝐹) is the normalization denominator to ensure that the probabilities sum to one. Note that we define the feature functions {ℎm(𝐸, 𝐹)} in log domain to simplify the notation in later sections. Feature weights 𝛌 = [𝜆m) are usually tuned by MERT.

The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system. In IWSLT 2011 Benchmark, our system using the proposed method achieves the best Chinese-to-English translation result on the task of translating TED talks. 1. Introduction Discriminative training is an active area in statistical machine translation (SMT) (e.g., Och et al., 2002, 2003, Liang et al., 2006, Blunsom et al., 2008, Chiang et al., 2009, Foster et al, 2010, Xiao et al. 2011). Och (2003) proposed using a loglinear model to incorporate multiple features for translation, and proposed a minimum error rate training (MERT) method to train the feature weights to optimize a desirable translation metric. While the log-linear model itself is discriminative, the phrase and lexicon translation features, which are among the most important components of SMT, are derived from either generative models or heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003, Brown et al., 1993). Moreover, the parameters in the phrase and lexicon translation models are estimated b</context>

However, there are a large number of parameters in these models, making discriminative training for them non-trivial (e.g., Liang et al., 2006, Chiang et al., 2009). Liang et al. (2006) proposed a large set of lexical and Part-of-Speech features and trained the model weights associated with these features using perceptron. Since many of the reference translations are non-reachable, an empirical local updating strategy had to be devised to fix this problem by picking a pseudo reference. Many such non-desirable heuristics led to moderate gains reported in that work. Chiang et al. (2009) improved a syntactic SMT system by adding as many as ten thousand syntactic features, and used Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) to train the feature weights. However, the number of parameters in common phrase and lexicon translation models is much larger. In this work, we present a new, highly effective discriminative learning method for phrase and lexicon translation models. The training objective is an expected BLEU score, which is closely linked to translation quality. Further, we apply a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence regularization to prevent over-fitting. For effective optimiza</context>

Experimental results showed that their approach outperformed a baseline by 0.8 BLEU point when using monotonic decoding, but there was no significant gain over a stronger baseline with a full-distortion model. In our work, we use the expectation of BLEU scores as the objective. This avoids the heuristics of picking the updating reference and therefore gives a more principal way of setting the training objective. As another closely related study, Chiang et al. (2009) incorporated about ten thousand syntactic features in addition to the baseline features. The feature weights are trained on a tuning set with 2010 sentences using MIRA. In our work, we have many more parameters to train, and the training is conducted on the entire training corpora. Our GT based optimization algorithm is highly parallelizable and efficient, which is the key for large scale discriminative training. As a further related work, Rosti et al. (2011) have proposed using differentiable expected BLEU score as the objective to train system combination parameters. Other work related to t</context>

Och (2003) proposed using a loglinear model to incorporate multiple features for translation, and proposed a minimum error rate training (MERT) method to train the feature weights to optimize a desirable translation metric.

Moreover, the parameters in the phrase and lexicon translation models are estimated by relative frequency or maximizing joint likelihood, which may not correspond closely to the translation measure, e.g., bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) (Papineni et al., 2002). Therefore, it is desirable to train all these parameters to directly maximize an objective that directly links to translation quality. However, there are a large number of parameters in these models, making discriminative training for them non-trivial (e.g., Liang et al., 2006, Chiang et al., 2009). Liang e</context>

However, as pointed out by Liang et al (2006), the same problem as in the bold updating existed, i.e., forced alignment between a source sentence and its reference translation was tricky, and the proposed alignment was likely to be unreliable. The method presented in this paper is free from this problem. 3. Phrase-based Translation System The translation process of phrase-based SMT can be briefly described in three steps: segment source sentence into a sequence of phrases, translate each 293 source phrase to a target phrase, re-order target phrases into target sentence (Koehn et al., 2003). In decoding, the optimal translation 𝐸 given the source sentence F is obtained according to where 3.2. Lexicon translation model There are several variations in lexicon translation features (Ayan and Dorr 2006, Koehn et al., 2003, Quirk et al., 2005). We use the word translation table from IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) and compute the sum over all possible word alignments within a phrase pair without normalizing for length (Quirk et al., 2005). The source-to-target forward lexicon (FL) translation feature is: ℎFL 𝐸, 𝐹 = 𝑝 𝑒k,m 𝑓k,r 1 𝑍 𝑒𝑥𝑝 𝜆mlog ℎm(𝐸, 𝐹) 𝑃𝐸𝐹= 𝐸 = argmax E 𝑃 𝐸 𝐹 (1) (2) (5</context>

Features used in a phrase-based system usually include LM, reordering model, word and phrase counts, and phrase and lexicon translation models. Given the focus of this paper, we review only the phrase and lexicon translation models below. 3.1. Phrase translation model A set of phrase pairs are extracted from wordaligned parallel corpus according to phrase extraction rules (Koehn et al., 2003). Phrase translation probabilities are then computed as relative frequencies of phrases over the training dataset. i.e., the probability of translating a source phrase 𝑓 to a target phrase 𝑒 is computed by where 𝐶 (𝑒, 𝑓) is the joint counts of 𝑒 and 𝑓 , and 𝐶 (𝑓) is the marginal counts of 𝑓. In translation, the input sentence is segmented into K phrases, and the source-to-target forward phrase (FP) translation feature is scored as: where 𝑒k and 𝑓k are the k-th phrase in E and F, respectively.

To build the baseline phrase-based SMT system, we first perform word alignment on the training set using a hidden Markov model with lexicalized distortion (He 2007), then extract the phrase table from the word aligned bilingual texts (Koehn et al., 2003). The maximum phrase length is set to four. Other models used in the baseline system include lexicalized ordering model, word count and phrase count, and a 3-gram LM trained on the English side of the parallel training corpus. Feature weights are tuned by MERT. A fast beam-search phrasebased decoder (Moore and Quirk 2007) is used and the distortion limit is set to four. Details of the phrase and lexicon translation models are given in Table 1. This baseline achieves a BLEU score of 26.22% on the test set.

The proposed method, evaluated on the Europarl German-to-English dataset, leads to a 1.1 BLEU point improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline translation system. In IWSLT 2011 Benchmark, our system using the proposed method achieves the best Chinese-to-English translation result on the task of translating TED talks. 1. Introduction Discriminative training is an active area in statistical machine translation (SMT) (e.g., Och et al., 2002, 2003, Liang et al., 2006, Blunsom et al., 2008, Chiang et al., 2009, Foster et al, 2010, Xiao et al. 2011). Och (2003) proposed using a loglinear model to incorporate multiple features for translation, and proposed a minimum error rate training (MERT) method to train the feature weights to optimize a desirable translation metric. While the log-linear model itself is discriminative, the phrase and lexicon translation features, which are among the most important components of SMT, are derived from either generative models or heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003, Brown et al., 1993).

The proposed method is also successfully evaluated on the IWSLT 2011 benchmark test set, where the task is to translate TED talks (www.ted.com). Our experimental results on this open-domain spoken language translation task show that the proposed method leads to significant translation performance improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline, and the system using the proposed method achieved the best single system translation result in the Chineseto-English MT track. 2. Related Work One best known approach in discriminative training for SMT is proposed by Och (2003). In that work, multiple features, most of them are derived from generative models, are incorporated into a log-linear model, and the relative weights of them are tuned discriminatively on a small tuning set. However, in practice, this approach only works with a handful of parameters. More closely related to our work, Liang et al. (2006) proposed a large set of lexical and Part-ofSpeech features in addition to the phrase translation model. Weights of these features are trained using perceptron on a training set of 67K sentences. In that paper, the authors pointed out that forcing the model to </context>

While the log-linear model itself is discriminative, the phrase and lexicon translation features, which are among the most important components of SMT, are derived from either generative models or heuristics (Koehn et al., 2003, Brown et al., 1993). Moreover, the parameters in the phrase and lexicon translation models are estimated by relative frequency or maximizing joint likelihood, which may not correspond closely to the translation measure, e.g., bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) (Papineni et al., 2002). Therefore, it is desirable to train all these parameters to directly maximize an objective that directly links to translation quality. However, there are a large number of parameters in these models, making discriminative training for them non-trivial (e.g., Liang et al., 2006, Chiang et al., 2009). Liang et al. (2006) proposed a large set of lexical and Part-of-Speech features and trained the model weights associated with these features using perceptron.

Phrase-based Translation System The translation process of phrase-based SMT can be briefly described in three steps: segment source sentence into a sequence of phrases, translate each 293 source phrase to a target phrase, re-order target phrases into target sentence (Koehn et al., 2003).

Lexicon translation model There are several variations in lexicon translation features (Ayan and Dorr 2006, Koehn et al., 2003, Quirk et al., 2005). We use the word translation table from IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) and compute the sum over all possible word alignments within a phrase pair without normalizing for length (Quirk et al., 2005).
