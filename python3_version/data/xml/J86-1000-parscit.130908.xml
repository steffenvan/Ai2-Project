Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976925">
Manuscripts submitted to Computational Linguistics should be typed on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should
begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted
in English.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.717185">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.853362041666667">
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computa-
tional linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a
paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced
pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at
least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject
area.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is
not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If
any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication. the details of
such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a
paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement
signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire&amp;quot;, by the employer. This written trans-
fer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary
results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Techni-
cal correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical corre-
spondence is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the reader-
ship. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for
inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:
James F. Allen, CL Editor
Department of Computer Science
The University of Rochester
Rochester, NY 14627
arpanet: ACL@ROCHESTER.ARPA
Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact the Book
Review Editor; publishers may also submit copies of books for review directly to the Book Review
Editor:
Graeme Hirst, CL Book Review Editor
Department of Computer Science
University of Toronto
Toronto, CANADA M5S 1A4
arpanet: GH@TORONTO.CSNET
The Finite String Editor should receive (a) copies of technical reports and reprints of papers
published elsewhere — or at least citation information and abstracts of such items and of books and
monographs; (b) summaries of research in progress — of particular interest would be perspectives on
the activities at a particular institution; (c) announcements of meetings of potential interest to the
membership; and (d) personal notes (e.g., honors, moving, changes in status). Two copies of
submissions should be sent to the Finite String Editor:
Ralph Weischedel, Finite String Editor
Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.
10 Moulton Street
Cambridge, MA 02238
arpanet: WEISCHEDEL@BBNG
Fuller instructions about the format of submissions can be found in the first issue of each volume.
NOTE All submissions other than papers should reach the pertinent editor no later than the 15th of
the first month of each quarter.

<bodyText confidence="0.878367384615385">
Manuscripts submitted to Computational Linguistics should be typed on letter-size paper (8.5
by 11 inch or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The full
first name and initial of each author should be provided, followed by the corresponding insti-
tutions and complete mailing addresses. Manuscripts must be submitted in English.
The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. It
should state the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principle conclu-
sions and recommendations. It is preferable that the abstract not be in the first person, and it
should not contain any mathematical notation or cite references. Work planned but not
completed should not appear. Since the abstract will be used to select appropriate referees, it
is essential to make it as informative as possible.
References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the paper according to
the following style, where the naming convention is &apos;Surname, Firstname Initial.&apos; and multiple
authors are separated by semicolons, the last one being preceded by &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;:

References in the text should have the form `surname(s) (date)&apos;, for example &amp;quot;Smith and
Jones (1963) show ...&amp;quot;. Alternatively, the complete reference can be enclosed in parentheses,
for example &amp;quot;The system EZPARSE (Smith and Jones 1963) ...&amp;quot;.
Footnotes should be avoided as much as possible. Whenever it does not impede the logic or
readability of the paper, footnote material should be integrated into the text. When necessary,
they should be numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article and appear at the
bottom of the page on which they are referenced.
Notation should be selected so as to simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures
should be devised with consideration for whether they would require one column or two
columns in the text. All figures in the final manuscript will be the author&apos;s responsibility. For
initial submission of papers for refereeing, the figures should be integrated into the text as
much as possible, rather than being inserted at the end of the document. Original line draw-
ings must be drawn in black ink on white paper; the lines should be heavy enough to
reproduce well. Photographs should be in black and white on glossy paper. Computer print-
out is not acceptable for figures; any such copy should be redone in a comparable type font.
CL is interested in exploring the use of electronic submission for the final manuscript, for
those able to produce and transmit copy in that form. We are prepared to handle both tape
and network transmissions. For such a submission, it is essential to reduce the problems
entailed in introducing format commands. The easiest situation for our Production Editor at
present is to eliminate all such commands, separating sections that are handled differently by
blank lines. It is, of course, essential to accompany the electronic transmission with a graphic
version that indicates the preferred format. It should be recognized that deviations from
personal preferences may occur in the interest of ensuring a more consistent style for our jour-
nal (see below). Electronic submissions should be sent directly to the Production Editor at the
mailing or net addresses provided on the inside front cover.
In order to have consistant handling of the various text elements in articles appearing in
Computational Linguistics, the following conventions will be used. Please mark your manu-
script or copy of your paper accordingly. Note that punctuation marks will follow closing
quotation marks unless the punctuation mark is a part of the quoted material.
