memory and association (Jusczyk &amp; Hohne, 199 7;
Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, &amp; Newport, 1999). The
acquisition of complex ‘across the board’ grammar
does not appear to be necessary to explain
children’s behavior before age three or more. At
that age, much more complex and structured input
data will be available to children, thereby
increasing their learning capacities and reducing
the limitations on knowledge they may acquire.
2 A testing procedure in three parts
The testing procedure for grammatical
development that will be implemented in this
report is made of three parts.
The goal of the first and the second part is to de-
termine the basic elements that children use to con-
struct language. Two assumptions are made about

A testing procedure is proposed to re-
evaluate the syntactic burst in children over
age two. The experimentation is based on
the children’s capacities in perception,
memory, association and cognition, and
does not presuppose any specific innate
grammatical capaciti es. The procedure is
tested using the large Manchester corpus in
the CHILDES database. The results
showed that young children grammatical
capabilities (before age three) could be the
results of simple mechanisms and that
complex linguistic mastery does not need
to be available so early in the course of lan-
guage development.

Between the ages of two and three, most children
go through a syntactic burst. In other words, they
progress from uttering one word at a time to
constructing utterances with a mean length of more
than three words, and frequently longer, and they
do this without any negative evidence and with
limited input data (Ritchie &amp; Bhatia, 1999). This
represents quite a mystery, which is often
explained by postulating the existence of innate
constraints on the grammar of the human
languages and the human mind (Pinker, 1984;
Wexler, 1982). This report uses an iterative
procedure to demonstrate that what appears to be
near magical could result mostly from mechanisms
that do not require the existence of innate
principles of grammar, as they are based on
children’s inherent capacities for perception,

produce again; and, when their language exactly
reproduces an adult’s, this can be explained as a
simple copy of their input.
Part 1: All single-word utterances produced by
children are meaningful to them; they are directly
derived from adults’ output. They are the basic
elements that children use to build language.
Part 2: Children’s multi-word utterances con-
taining only one word already produced in isola-
tion (words produced in part 1), along with other
words never produced in isolation (never produced
at part 1), are also basic elements that children use
to speak. They are also directly derived from chil-
dren’s input; this is facilitated by the children’s
knowledge of isolated words. These multi-word
utterances are manipulated and understood by chil-

dren as single blocks, just as isolated words are.
They may also be called frozen forms.
The goal of the third part is to check whether the
basic elements identified in part 1 and 2 are suffi-
cient to account for the children’s multiword utter-
ances.
Part 3: Children link utterances produced at
parts 1 and 2 to produce multi-word utterances
with more than one word already produced in iso-
lation (words produced in part 1). They do this us-
ing a simple concatenation mechanism and the fact
that the utterances they create have a pertinent
meaning prevents them from producing aberrant
utterances.
Since the productions of children and their adult
partners are easy to record, it is possible to test
whether the testing procedure has sufficient gen-
erative power to account for all children’s produc-
tions. However, some points could make such a
demonstration more difficult than it appears. First
of all, the assumption made in part 1 is not always
true, as it is quite possible for a child to reproduce
any sequence of sounds while playing with lan-
guage. This uncertainty about part 1 is only impor-
tant in conjunction with part 2, as isolated words
are the key used to parse the elements of part 2. To
decide that a word has meaning in isolation for a
child, it has been assumed that it must first have
meaning in isolation for an adult. Words in the
categories of determiner and auxiliary produced in
isolation have been considered as not having
meaning in isolation and have therefore been re-
moved from the elements gathered at part 1.
Analysis of language data demonstrated that this
assumption is quite reasonable, as the use of these
words in isolation is often the result o f unfinished
utterances, with incomplete prosody.
Measuring the generative power of the testing
procedure implies evaluating the accuracy of the
assumptions made in parts 1, 2 and 3. These as-
sumptions are quite easy to accept for very young
children, at the time of the first multi-word utter-
ances, i.e. before age two. The question is: to what
extent is this true and until what age? Two experi-
ments have been carried out in order to answer this
question.

3 Experiment 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958807692308">
The experiment 1 used a corpus extracted from
the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000). It is
referred to as the Manchester corpus (Theakston,
Lieven, Pine, &amp; Rowland, 1999) and consists of
recordings of 12 children from the age of 1;10 to
2;9. Their mean length of utterance varies from 1.5
to 2.9 words. Each child was seen 34 times and
each recording lasted one hour. This results in a
total production of 537,811 words in token and
7,840 in type. For each child, the average is 44,817
words in token (SD = 9,653) and 1,913 in type (SD
= 372).
The testing procedure was run in three steps in
an iterative way. Each step from the experiment
corresponds to one of the parts described above.
Step 1: For each transcript, the child’s single-
word utterances are extracted and added to a cumu-
lative list of words uttered in isolation, referred to
as L1. It is possible to measure at this point
whether the words on L1 can be derived from the
adult’s output. In order to do this, a cumulative list,
L-adult, of all adult utterances is also maintained.
Step 2: For each multi-word utterance in the
transcript, the number of words previously uttered
in isolation is computed using list L1. Multi-word
utterances with only one word uttered in isolation
are added to a list called L2. It is possible to meas-
ure at this point whether the utterances on L2 can
be derived from the adult’s output (list L-adult
above).
Step 3: the remaining utterances (list L3), which
contain more than one word previously uttered in
isolation, are used to test the final step of the algo-
rithm. The test consists in trying to reconstruct
these utterances using a catenation of the utter-
ances from lists L1 and L2 only. Two measure-
ments can be obtained: the percentage of utter-
ances on list L3 that can be fully reconstructed (re-
ferred to below as the ‘percentage of exact recon-
struction’) and the percentage of words in the ut-
terances on list L3 that contribute to a reconstruc-
tion (referred to below as the ‘percentage of recon-
struction covering’). For example, for the utterance
‘The boy has gone to school’, if L1 and L2 contain
‘the boy’ and ‘has gone’ but not ‘to school’, only
‘the boy has gone’ can be reconstructed, thus lead-
ing to a percentage of reconstruction covering of
66%. Thus, the percentage of exact reconstruction
is the percentage of utterances with a 100% recon-
struction covering. The percentages of list L3 that
are reconstructed or recovered do not include ut-
terances from L1 and L2 lists.

<bodyText confidence="0.985049086956522">
The testing procedure is iterative because it is
performed in turn for each of the transcripts of the
corpus. List L1, L2 and L-adult are cumulative,
which means that the list obtained with transcript 1
are used as a starting point for the analysis of tran-
script 2, and so on. This presupposes that children
can reuse data they heard only once a long time
after they heard it.
In Step 1 it was found that the percentage of
words on L1 present in adult speech has a mean
value of 91% (SD = 0.03). Step 2 revealed that the
speech has a mean value of 67% (SD = 0.05).
These two results are stable across ages—even
though lists L1, L2 and L-adult are growing con-
tinuously. After two transcripts, for all 12 children,
lists L1 + L2 represent 11,979 words in token and
L-adult contains 82,255 words in token. After 17
transcripts, these totals are 89,479 and 688,802,
respectively. After 34 transcripts, they total
167,149 and 1,370,565. The ratio comparing the
size of L1 + L2 and L-adult does not evolve much,
varying between 6 and 8.

The results for Step 3 are presented in Figures 1
and 2. Each point in the series corresponds to the
nth iteration performed with the nth transcript. The
mean value is the mean of the percentage for all
children considered as individuals (reconstruction
between a child’s corpus and his/her parents’
corpus only). The algorithm is also applied to all
corpora: for each point in the series of recordings,
the 12 files corresponding to 12 children are
gathered into a single file used to run the nth
iteration of the algorithm. Percentages for all
corpora are shown with a bold line. The
percentages are clearly higher for the aggregated
corpora, although the number of unknown
utterances (list L3) increased more than the
number of known utterances (lists L1 and L2).
After two transcripts, there are half as many
elements in list L3 as in L1 + L2. But after 17
transcripts, L3 is 42% larger than L1 + L2, and
after 34 transcripts, it is 127% larger. As children
grow older, there is a decrease in the scores for
exact reconstruction and reconstruction covering.
This decrease is greater in individuals than for the
children as a group, which suggests a size effect.

4 Experiment 2
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975135593221">
The second experiment uses the same corpus and
reproduces the same tests but assumes that children
have knowledge of the syntactic categories Noun
and Verb. The conditions of step 2 and step 3 are
more easily fulfilled if the children have a certain
amount of syntactic class knowledge. As described
by Maratsos and Chalkley (1980), it is possible for
children to learn syntactic classes from the con-
texts in which words occur. However, knowledge
of part of speech is unlikely in very young children
on the basis of syntactic distribution. Semantic
knowledge can also help to construct syntactic
knowledge (Bloom, 1999) for classes such as
common nouns, proper nouns and verbs, and per-
haps also adjectives and adverbs. To simulate the
fact that children are able to construct the classes
of common nouns, proper nouns and non-auxiliary
verbs, it suffices to substitute every occurrence of
common or proper nouns in the Manchester corpus
by the symbol ‘noun’ and every occurrence of non-
auxiliary verbs by the symbol ‘verb’. This is easy
to realize because the Manchester corpus has been
fully tagged for part of speech, as described in the
MOR section of the CHILDES manual
(MacWhinney, 2000). The result is that list L1 now
includes all nouns, all verbs plus all words occur-
ring in isolation, as in the first experiment. In list
L2, in utterances that include a word from the
categories Noun or Verb, this word is substituted
by the symbol ‘noun’ or ‘verb’. These utterances
now form rule-like productive patterns known as
formulaic frames (Peters, 1995) or slot-and-frame
structures (Lieven, Pine, &amp; Baldwin, 1997) — for
example, ‘my + NOUN’.
When we reproduce the first experiment under
these conditions, the new results obtained at steps
2 and 3 should be better, in the sense that they
should correspond more closely to the adult input,
and should hold up longer on the age scale.
The results for Step 1 and Step 2 are indeed bet-
ter than before. The percentage of utterances on L2
present in adult speech has a mean value of 91%
(SD = 0.02).
The results for Step 3 are presented in Figure 3
(for exact reconstruction) and Figure 4 (for recon-
struction covering). In each of these figures, two
results are presented for the whole Manchester
corpus: one assuming no category knowledge, and
one assuming the knowledge of the three catego-
ries proper noun, common noun and verb. The per-
centages of reconstruction become markedly
higher, as any combination that contains some of
three categories proper noun, common noun and
verb is known for all occurrences of words from
these categories. The mean for exact reconstruction
with ‘no category’ knowledge is 67% (SD = 5.7)
and 87% (SD = 2.0) for reconstruction covering.
These values increase to 83% (SD = 5.2) and 95%
(SD = 2.6) for ‘noun and verb’ knowledge.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999753">
A limit of experiments 1 and 2 is that nothing indi-
cates how long the three-step mechanisms would
remain efficient and appropriate. We supposed that
these mechanisms would remain operational at an
older age. This can be checked using other material
from the CHILDES database with recordings
spanning a longer period. The corpus chosen for
the test is Brown’s (1973) Sarah corpus, which
ranges from age 2;3 to age 5;1; with its 139 differ-
ent transcripts, it follows the development of the
child’s language quite well and is well suited for
the purposes of this study, which requires lengthy
corpora. The mean length of utterance varies from
1.47 to 4.85 words. This results in a total produc-
tion of 99,918 words in token and 3,990 in type.
Step 1 found the percentage of words on L1 pre-
sent in adult speech to have a mean value of 77%
(SD = 14.5). Step 2 revealed that the percentage of
elements of L2 present in adult speech had a mean
value of 38% (SD = 11.5). These two results are

stable across ages. With the assumption of a
knowledge of the Noun and Verb categories, re-
sults for Step 1 and 2 are, respectively, 83% (SD =
13.8) and 55% (SD = 16.6).
The results for Step 3 are presented in Figure 5
(for exact reconstruction) and Figure 6 (for recon-
struction covering). In each of these figures, two
results are presented: one assuming no category
knowledge and one assuming knowledge of the
three categories Proper Noun, Common Noun and
Verb. The mean for exact reconstruction with “no
category” knowledge is 54% (SD = 17.6) and 84%
(SD = 6.6) for reconstruction covering. These val-
ues increase 72% (SD = 11.9) and 93% (SD = 4.0)
for “Noun and Verb” knowledge.

The average percentages of reconstruction are
lower for the Sarah corpus than for the Manchester
corpus. Comparing Figures 3 and 6 and Figures 4
and 7, one can see that there is a drop in the recon-
struction performances in the third year. The per-
centages for Sarah in her second year were as high
as those for the Manchester corpus children. Part
of this drop in performance may be attributed to
the smaller corpus. Indeed, comparing Figures 1
and 3 and Figures 2 and 4, it appears that the drop
in performance that became visible when single
child corpora were used was not in evidence when
all the corpora were amalgamated into one big cor-
pus. It is also possible that the drop in performance
found in the Sarah corpus reflects a progressive
decrease in the systematic use of a simple concate-
nation procedure by the child.

<bodyText confidence="0.999994268292683">
The testing procedure does not achieve a full 100%
reconstruction in the test conditions described
above, where the database consists of only 34 one-
hour recordings for each of the 12 children in the
corpus. This corresponds globally to a pseudo-
corpus of 408 hours, which amounts to 8 to 10
weeks of speech. With a larger corpus, the results
would probably be better, as indicated by the
increase in percentage of recovery when one
moves from children in isolation to children as a
group (see Figures 1 and 2). In addition, there are
bound to be words that children utter for the first
time in multi-word utterances even though they
could have been produced as isolated utterances.
The percentage of reconstruction, however, is still
quite high, as was the case for results obtained
using a similar methodology with Hungarian
children (MacWhinney, 1975). With the
assumption of a benefit from the use of the Noun
and Verb categories, which somewhat circumvents
the limited size of the corpus, the results are very
high.
A problem with the second experiment is that it
is not sure that children can have a knowledge of
part of speech (even very general part of speech
such as noun and verb) with semantic knowledge
only. However, the experiment 2 is interesting as it
can be viewed as a way to extend artificially a lim-
ited corpus. Instead of saying that children have
the knowledge of part of speech, we propose that
noun and verb as so common in adult speech that
an extended corpus will contain all basic utterances
with a single content word and the appropriate
grammatical context. In other words, list L2 will
contain all the most basic syntactic constructions.
Although this will not be the case in reality, it is
indeed possible that a full corpus covering all ut-
terances produced by adults will contains a very
large number of L2 structures. In this way, exper-
irment 2 provides a measure of the upper limit that
can be reached by the crude mechanism presented
in this article (L3 constructions).
The testing procedure does not cover all lan-
guage acquisition processes before the age of three.
Its rather crude mechanisms would, on their own,
produce many aberrant utterances if they were not
regulated by other mechanisms. The first of these
regulatory mechanisms is semantics, as children
produce language that, for them, makes sense.
They will articulate thoughts with two or three
elements that complement each other logically and
thus create utterances interpretable by adults.
Strange utterances may be produced on occasion
but none will sound alien. Secondly, even though
children sometimes join words or groups of words
randomly when very young, they soon start to fol-
low a systematic order probably copied from
adults’ utterances (Sinclair &amp; Bronckart, 1972). To
do this, they merely have to concentrate on the
words or groups of words that they already master,
having previously uttered them as single words.
Indeed, form-function mapping is easier with sin-
gle-word utterances than with multi-word utter-
ances and this helps to manipulate single-word
forms consciously. Thus, single-word utterances
are better candidates than most to become the first
elements in a combinatorial system and to undergo
representational redescription (Karmiloff-Smith,
1992). Their semantic values allow one to perform
semantic combinations. By the age of two, associa-
tions words or frozen forms may be sufficient to
allow children to produce and control language.
The fact that children can learn to produce com-
plex speech patterns quickly without complex
grammatical knowledge casts a whole new light on
the problem of the acquisition of syntax. The test-
ing procedure relies heavily on semantics because
it is assumed that what children understand, they
will remember and manipulate. This does not nec-
essarily contradict all the theories that claim that
there are some innate principles specific to gram-
mar acquisition (Pinker, 1984; Wexler, 1982). If

children acquire high-level grammatical rules at a
later period of their development than is usually
admitted in these theories, then the structure of
their input—the couple ‘base phrase marker’ plus
‘surface sentence’ (Wexler, 1982) — will be more
complex. The more complex these structures, the
lower the innate conditions on grammars. It would
then be possible to progress from a simple system
such as the association of frozen elements to a
more complex one. Late grammatical acquisition is
a very important notion as it goes a long way to-
wards explaining why there do not seem to be any
neuronal structures specific to language or gram-
mar (Elman et al., 1996; Muller, 1996). Late
grammatical acquisition is also highly compatible
with constructivist proposals such as Tomasello’s
(2003) and Goldberg’s (2006).
It has often been said that children already mas-
ter syntax by the age of three, which is quite re-
markable considering the complexity of what they
are acquiring. This report suggests that some sim-
ple generative mechanisms can explain the explo-
sive acquisition of an apparent mastery of language
observed in young children. It demonstrates once
again that, as already shown for other linguistic
developmental features (Elman et al., 1996), an
apparently complex output may be the product of a
simple system. The need for large-scale corpora to
better tackle the problem of language acquisition
with improved tools is also highlighted here.

The acquisition of complex ‘across the board’ grammar does not appear to be necessary to explain children’s behavior before age three or more. At that age, much more complex and structured input data will be available to children, thereby increasing their learning capacities and reducing the limitations on knowledge they may acquire. 2 A testing procedure in three parts The testing procedure for grammatical development that will be implemented in this report is made of three parts. The goal of the first and the second part is to determine the basic elements that children use to construct language. Two assumptions are made about children’s perceptive and mnemonic capaci- Abstract A testing procedure is proposed to reevaluate the syntactic burst in children over age two. The experimentation is based on the children’s capacities in perception, memory, association and cognition, and does not presuppose any specific innate grammatical capaciti es. The procedure is tested using the large Manchester corpus in the CHILDES database. The results showed that young children grammatical capabilities (before age three) could be the results of simple mechanisms and that complex linguistic mastery does not need to be available so early in the course of language development.</abstract>

As described by Maratsos and Chalkley (1980), it is possible for children to learn syntactic classes from the contexts in which words occur.

Semantic knowledge can also help to construct syntactic knowledge (Bloom, 1999) for classes such as common nouns, proper nouns and verbs, and perhaps also adjectives and adverbs. To simulate the fact that children are able to construct the classes of common nouns, proper nouns and non-auxiliary verbs, it suffices to substitute every occurrence of common or proper nouns in the Manchester corpus by the symbol ‘noun’ and every occurrence of nonauxiliary verbs by the symbol ‘verb’.

The more complex these structures, the lower the innate conditions on grammars. It would then be possible to progress from a simple system such as the association of frozen elements to a more complex one. Late grammatical acquisition is a very important notion as it goes a long way towards explaining why there do not seem to be any neuronal structures specific to language or grammar (Elman et al., 1996; Muller, 1996). Late grammatical acquisition is also highly compatible with constructivist proposals such as Tomasello’s (2003) and Goldberg’s (2006).

To do this, they merely have to concentrate on the words or groups of words that they already master, having previously uttered them as single words. Indeed, form-function mapping is easier with single-word utterances than with multi-word utterances and this helps to manipulate single-word forms consciously. Thus, single-word utterances are better candidates than most to become the first elements in a combinatorial system and to undergo representational redescription (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992). Their semantic values allow one to perform semantic combinations. By the age of two, associations words or frozen forms may be sufficient to allow children to produce and control language. The fact that children can learn to produce complex speech patterns quickly without complex grammatical knowledge casts a whole new light on the problem of the acquisition of syntax.

With a larger corpus, the results would probably be better, as indicated by the increase in percentage of recovery when one moves from children in isolation to children as a group (see Figures 1 and 2). In addition, there are bound to be words that children utter for the first time in multi-word utterances even though they could have been produced as isolated utterances. The percentage of reconstruction, however, is still quite high, as was the case for results obtained using a similar methodology with Hungarian children (MacWhinney, 1975). With the assumption of a benefit from the use of the Noun and Verb categories, which somewhat circumvents the limited size of the corpus, the results are very high. A problem with the second experiment is that it is not sure that children can have a knowledge of part of speech (even very general part of speech such as noun and verb) with semantic knowledge only. However, the experiment 2 is interesting as it can be viewed as a way to extend artificially a limited corpus. Instead of saying that children have the knowledge of part of speech, we propose that noun and verb as so common in adult </context>

Measuring the generative power of the testing procedure implies evaluating the accuracy of the assumptions made in parts 1, 2 and 3. These assumptions are quite easy to accept for very young children, at the time of the first multi-word utterances, i.e. before age two. The question is: to what extent is this true and until what age? Two experiments have been carried out in order to answer this question. 3 Experiment 1 The experiment 1 used a corpus extracted from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000). It is referred to as the Manchester corpus (Theakston, Lieven, Pine, &amp; Rowland, 1999) and consists of recordings of 12 children from the age of 1;10 to 2;9. Their mean length of utterance varies from 1.5 to 2.9 words. Each child was seen 34 times and each recording lasted one hour. This results in a total production of 537,811 words in token and 7,840 in type. For each child, the average is 44,817 words in token (SD = 9,653) and 1,913 in type (SD = 372).

The first of these regulatory mechanisms is semantics, as children produce language that, for them, makes sense. They will articulate thoughts with two or three elements that complement each other logically and thus create utterances interpretable by adults. Strange utterances may be produced on occasion but none will sound alien. Secondly, even though children sometimes join words or groups of words randomly when very young, they soon start to follow a systematic order probably copied from adults’ utterances (Sinclair &amp; Bronckart, 1972). To do this, they merely have to concentrate on the words or groups of words that they already master, having previously uttered them as single words. Indeed, form-function mapping is easier with single-word utterances than with multi-word utterances and this helps to manipulate single-word forms consciously. Thus, single-word utterances are better candidates than most to become the first elements in a combinatorial system and to undergo representational redescription (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992). Their semantic values allow one to perform semantic combinations. By the age of two, associations wor</context>

Measuring the generative power of the testing procedure implies evaluating the accuracy of the assumptions made in parts 1, 2 and 3. These assumptions are quite easy to accept for very young children, at the time of the first multi-word utterances, i.e. before age two. The question is: to what extent is this true and until what age? Two experiments have been carried out in order to answer this question. 3 Experiment 1 The experiment 1 used a corpus extracted from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000). It is referred to as the Manchester corpus (Theakston, Lieven, Pine, &amp; Rowland, 1999) and consists of recordings of 12 children from the age of 1;10 to 2;9. Their mean length of utterance varies from 1.5 to 2.9 words. Each child was seen 34 times and each recording lasted one hour. This results in a total production of 537,811 words in token and 7,840 in type. For each child, the average is 44,817 words in token (SD = 9,653) and 1,913 in type (SD = 372). The testing procedure was run in three steps in an iterative way. Each step from the experiment corresponds to one of the parts described above.

In other words, they progress from uttering one word at a time to constructing utterances with a mean length of more than three words, and frequently longer, and they do this without any negative evidence and with limited input data (Ritchie &amp; Bhatia, 1999). This represents quite a mystery, which is often explained by postulating the existence of innate constraints on the grammar of the human languages and the human mind (Pinker, 1984; Wexler, 1982). This report uses an iterative procedure to demonstrate that what appears to be near magical could result mostly from mechanisms that do not require the existence of innate principles of grammar, as they are based on children’s inherent capacities for perception, 65 produce again; and, when their language exactly reproduces an adult’s, this can be explained as a simple copy of their input. Part 1: All single-word utterances produced by children are meaningful to them; they are directly derived from adults’ output. They are the basic elements that children use to build language.

By the age of two, associations words or frozen forms may be sufficient to allow children to produce and control language. The fact that children can learn to produce complex speech patterns quickly without complex grammatical knowledge casts a whole new light on the problem of the acquisition of syntax. The testing procedure relies heavily on semantics because it is assumed that what children understand, they will remember and manipulate. This does not necessarily contradict all the theories that claim that there are some innate principles specific to grammar acquisition (Pinker, 1984; Wexler, 1982). If 71 children acquire high-level grammatical rules at a later period of their development than is usually admitted in these theories, then the structure of their input—the couple ‘base phrase marker’ plus ‘surface sentence’ (Wexler, 1982) — will be more complex. The more complex these structures, the lower the innate conditions on grammars. It would then be possible to progress from a simple system such as the association of frozen elements to a more complex one. Late grammatical acquisition is a very important notion as it goes a long way towards explaining why there do not seem to be any </context>
