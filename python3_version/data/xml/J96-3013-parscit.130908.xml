This book contains a series of papers, the
majority of which come from a workshop
on the semantics of prepositions held at
the Institut fur Angewandte Informations-
forschung, Germany, in February 1990. The
broader topic of the book is the conceptu-
alization of space and the editor&apos;s intention
is to shed light on this by bringing together
people working on the mental interpretation
of prepositions. The editor is particularly in-
terested in the computational processing of
prepositions.
There are 14 papers in the book, falling
under the following headings: Introduction
(by Zelinsky-Wibbelt); lexicalization patterns
of prepositions; semantic categorization of
prepositions and context; contrastive impli-
cations of prepositions; and image under-
standing and prepositions.
Zelinsky-Wibbelt gives an excellent intro-
duction to the book by motivating the impor-
tance of looking at the semantics of words
in general and prepositions in particular. She
points out that if we are not able to make the
right semantic distinctions, then natural lan-
guage processing, machine translation, and
vision processing will be futile. I like the fact
that she has seen that prepositions and their
meaning lie at the junction where language
and vision processing meet and this is cer-
tainly a focus of much of this work of late
(McKevitt 1995-96). It is certainly becoming
clear now that spatial relations between, and
reference to, objects in the world lie at the
center of integrated artificial intelligence, nat-
ural language processing, and vision process-
ing (Olivier 1995).
The volume focuses on two major para-
digms: Cognitive Grammar, whose follow-
ers are Lakoff (1987) and Langacker (1988),
and the two-level approach to semantics fol-
lowed by Bierwisch and Lang (1989). In Cog-
nitive Grammar, it is recognized that all men-
tal experience is gained from physical ex-
perience functioning in a physical environ-
ment and that prepositions and hence spa-
tial expressions can function as higher-order
mental models for abstract and complex sit-
uations. Abstract concepts are metaphors of
concrete spatial predications. In the two-
level approach, a distinction is made be-
tween objects that are inherently oriented
(e.g., coin, book), and thus have meaning
independent of their orientation in context,
and those that are canonically oriented (e.g.,
wardrobe, chest, tower), and thus don&apos;t; and
of course there are neutral objects (e.g., ball,
cube, star). The two-level approach is axis-
based and object-oriented, and focuses on
the speaker&apos;s line of sight and the orienta-
tion of objects, whereas the Cognitive Gram-
mar approach focuses on how the speaker&apos;s
intentions and perspective constrain his or
her conceptualization. Cognitive Grammar is
more concerned with how cognitive, biolog-
ical, and pragmatic principles underlie how
the speaker attributes salience to objects in a
given scene. Lang has a paper in this book
but neither Lakoff nor Langacker do.
In my view, Jorg Schirra&apos;s paper stood out
in the book; it focuses on the integration
of language and vision processing with re-
spect to reference semantics for spatial ex-
pressions (especially geometric relations). He
introduces the project VITRA (Visual TRAns-
lator), which started in 1985 and which ex-
amines the relations between speaking and
seeing. CITYTOUR and SOCCER are two
systems constructed in VITRA that trans-
form visual perceptions into language. SOC-
CER simultaneously analyzes and describes
in German short scenes from soccer games
like live radio reports. This involves perceiv-
ing the locations and movements of the ball
and players, interpreting movements with
respect to conventions of soccer games (es-
pecially plans and intentions), and selecting
which events to utter in what sequence. The
spatial relations considered are close to (Ger-
man) prepositions and the location of an ob-
ject is relevant only relative to other objects&apos;
positions. Probability clouds are used to give
meaning to relations between objects such as
being in, near, and infront of. The dense centers
of such clouds mark those positions rated as
good examples for the relations.
This book is worth reading for those who
are interested in machine translation and the
integration of natural language and vision

&amp;quot;Native speakers&apos; judgments of the accept-
ability of linguistic examples have always
formed a major part of the data of linguistics,
but linguists generally either have elicited
such data in a haphazard fashion and ac-
cepted the results uncritically or have re-

equally uncritically. Schtitze&apos;s book is a wel-
