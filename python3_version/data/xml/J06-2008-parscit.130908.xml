Intensional logic (IL) and its application to
natural language, which the present mono-
graph addresses, was first developed by
Richard Montague in the late 1960s (e.g.,
Montague 1970a, 1970b). Through the ef-
forts of (especially) Barbara Partee (e.g.,
Partee 1975, 1976), and Richmond Thomason,
who edited the posthumous collection of
Montague’s works (Thomason 1974), this be-
came the main framework for those who as-
pired to a formal semantic theory for natural
language, and these included computational
linguists as early as Jerry Hobbs in the late
1970s (e.g., Hobbs and Rosenschein 1977). In
fact, until the advent of the current interest in
statistical linguistics with its own conception
of what semantics is, IL, or some variant of
it, was perhaps the main theory of semantics
within computational linguistics generally.
And within current computational semantics
it still is.
But over the years, philosophers, linguists,
and computational linguists have noted a va-
riety of shortcomings in Montague’s version
of IL. Montague defined intensions as func-
tions from possible worlds to extensions in
that world. But this had the effect of mak-
ing logically equivalent expressions have the
same intension, thus leading to the problem
of “logical omniscience” (believing/knowing
all the logical consequences of what is be-
lieved/known). Montague had based his IL
on Church’s simple theory of types (Church
1940), supplemented with intensions of each
type. But this implies that each natural lan-
guage item accepts only arguments of some
one fixed type. However, this is not true for
natural language, where conjunctions, verbs,
and pretty much any functional term that
accepts arguments at all can accept argu-
ments of different types. (For example, and
can accept arguments that are of the sentence
type, of the verb phrase type, of the adjective
type, etc.; and indeed, it can accept arguments
of differing types in its different argument
places.) Much study has gone into techniques
for changing types of arguments so as to ac-
commodate this phenomenon. One result of
this has been to make the semantic struc-
ture of all complex items be binary—a con-
sequence that seems otherwise to be without
justification. And finally, Montague’s version
of IL is higher order, allowing quantification
over entities and functions of any level. This
results in the system not having a recursively
enumerable set of theorems, and there has al-
ways been a desire to have a more restricted
system for representing natural language.
The present monograph addresses all these
problematic issues. It develops a fine-grained
account of intensions from which an account
of a first-order property theory is extracted.
A “polymorphic” type structure is devel-
oped and the resulting system is claimed “to
permit us to achieve expressive power com-
parable to a higher-order system like IL while
remaining within the formal limits of a first-
order system.”
Although there are many quite difficult
concepts introduced in this monograph, in
the main it is very clearly written. If the
claims made by the authors for their new in-
tensional language are borne out by further
research, then this is a very important addi-
tion to the literature on the foundations of se-
mantics for natural language.—Francis Jeffry
