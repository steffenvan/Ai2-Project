An overview is provided of six information
visualization systems designed specifically for
gaining an overview of electronic health re-
cords (EHR). The systems discussed all make
use of timelines: Lifelines, Lifelines2,
KNAVE II, CLEF Visual Navigator, Time-
line, and AsbruView. With the exception of
Lifelines2, the main user groups targeted are
physicians involved in direct patient care. Lit-
tle attention has been paid towards supporting
true secondary use of EHR contents, for ac-
tivities such as assessing quality of care, pa-
tient health and safety monitoring, and clinical
trial recruitment. Future work on such systems
needs to address the complexity of EHR data,
missing and incomplete information, and dif-
ficulties in displaying data with differing lev-
els of granularity.

<bodyText confidence="0.999760906976744">
This paper provides an overview of several infor-
mation visualization (infovis) systems that have
been built for exploring abstracted information
from Electronic Health Records (EHR). EHRs are
systems that are used to document care of patients.
The records can include a wide range of data and
information, including medications prescribed and
administered, immunization history, laboratory test
results, allergies, radiology images, treatment
plans, and care notes. Currently, most EHR sys-
tems implemented are proprietary and highly cus-
tomized when used by larger care institutions.
It is usually the case that only clinicians and other
healthcare professionals with direct responsibility
for providing care have access to patient data. The
suggestion of secondary use of health data is not
new and has been handled separately from the is-
sue of creating user interfaces and visualizations.
Safran et al. discuss the purpose of clinical data
repositories in their white paper and point towards
the goal of a national framework for the secondary
use of health data in the U.S. (Safran et al., 2007).
According to their definition, secondary use in-
cludes activities such as analysis, research, quality
and safety measurement, public health, payment,
provider certification and accreditation, marketing,
and general business applications, while at the
same time taking into account the ethical, political,
technical and social implications of such re-use. De
Lusignan and van Weel highlight the challenges of
making use of clinical data for research, stating,
&amp;quot;The available research methods for working with
large data sets are limited; it is difficult to infer
meaning from data; there is a rapid pace of change
in both medicine and technology; and integrating
data without reliable unique identifiers is difficult.&amp;quot;
(de Lusignan and van Weel, 2006). Prokosch and
Ganslandt have recently summarized the latest ad-
vances in enabling clinical data re-use for research
purposes (Prokosch and Ganslandt, 2009). They
identify as key challenges the establishment of
comprehensive clinical data repositories, the estab-
lishment of professional IT infrastructure to sup-

port clinical data capture, and the integration of
medical record systems and clinical trial databases.
As discussed in these articles, aggregated, ab-
stracted and manipulable information is underutil-
ized and hard to come by.
The emerging field of Visual Analytics (Keim,
2008) is relevant to this review. This field is focus-
ing on combining related research areas such as
visualization, data mining and statistics to handle
large and heterogeneous volumes of data, such as
EHR. The systems we encountered are integrating
human judgment with automated analysis, suggest-
ing that future work will be related to handling
massive amounts of data that contains missing ele-
ments - including the results of textual analysis of
records content.

<bodyText confidence="0.999942545454545">
Our motivation for creating this overview is to
compare and discuss some of the available infor-
mation visualization/visual analytics tools and how
are these used for secondary, i.e. for purposes other
than direct patient care. This is a first step to-
wards infrastructure and coordinating efforts to
produce systems that are based on standard input
formats, and meet the needs of specifically defined
users. The reader of this overview is most likely
working on information extraction, temporal ab-
straction, and summarizing EHRs.

The review is non-systematic. We didn&apos;t expect to
find large numbers of articles, since this is a rela-

fined to user interfaces and visualizations for EHR
data, we searched pubmed, ACM digital library,
IEEE library, and Google Scholar, using basic
keywords and checked references in found articles.
We also looked for papers on work we had read or

In this section, we give an overview of the state-of-
the-art systems related to visualization of temporal
information in EHRs. Our intention is to cover
broad areas of application including representation
of medical histories, visual data query and aggre-
gation, generation of temporal abstractions and
visualization of treatment plans. Due to the limita-
tions in space, we focus only on the most represen-
tative systems, which feature interesting and
potentially reusable visualization techniques.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.738913">
Lifelines
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97299775">
LifeLines uses a timeline visualization technique to
represent personal histories, medical records and
other types on biographical data (Plaisant et al.,
1996). In LifeLines, horizontal bars are used to
depict temporal duration and location of events on
a horizontal time axis. Similar events are organized
into facets, which can be expanded and collapsed
to provide increasing or decreasing level of detail.
Color notations and line thickness are used to indi-
cate the importance and relationship of events. To
handle regions with high data density, LifeLines
provides zooming functionality allowing users to
compress and stretch the time scale at any location.
Additional content (e.g., multimedia) can be added
in a linked fashion. Authors apply LifeLines in the
analysis of complex patient medical records to
visualize temporal relationships between treat-
ments, consultations, disorders, prescriptions, hos-
pitalizations and other events.
Lifelines2
LifeLines2 (Wang et al., 2008) is an extension of
LifeLines, allowing the user to analyze records
from multiple patients at a time. The system facili-
tates comparative visualization of records by
</bodyText>

means of aligning, filtering and sorting operations.
By aligning patient records on some common ref-
erence event (e.g., the first heart attack), users can
easily spot co-occurring and neighboring events.
Ranking and filtering operations complement
alignment by interactively reordering or narrowing
the set of records to suit a user’s changing focus.
The system proved to be particularly suitable for
observational research, where researchers analyze
data from different studies in order to better under-
stand health problems or study the effect of treat-
ments, and in finding patients for clinical trials.
Evaluation studies showed that the system signifi-
cantly simplifies typical analytical tasks and that
medical specialists can quickly learn the interface.
LifeLines2 is currently used to display EHR data
provided by the Informatics for Integrating Biol-
ogy &amp; the Bedside (i2b2) Project (Murphy et al.,
2006).
While in LifeLines2 the main focus is on visualiz-
ing temporal ordering of events, Wang et al. em-
phasizes practical need in viewing multiple records
as an aggregate in order to study frequency of
event data over time (Wang et al., 2009). For in-
stance, a user might be interested to analyze blood
pressure of all patients who have had an open-heart
surgery within 3 months of their first heart attack.
As a solution, authors complement LifeLines2
framework with a new visualization technique,
called temporal summaries, which represents dis-
tributional trends of events over a set of records in
a histogram-like chart. Furthermore, the system
allows splitting the whole dataset of records into
multiple subsets and use temporal summaries to
compare event patterns between these groups.

CLEF
Hallet (Hallett, 2008) proposes a visualization ar-
chitecture for browsing medical histories, which
integrates visual navigation tools and automatically
generated textual summaries. While the graphical
interface facilitates interactive navigation, textual
descriptions can, in addition, convey complex tem-
poral information and display details that would
otherwise be too complex for visualization compo-
nents. Within the system, the patient’s medical his-
tory is represented as a network of semantically
and temporally organized events, which serves as
an input for visualization and natural language
generation components. The visual navigator de-
picts a high level overview of a patient’s medical
history by plotting events along three parallel time-
lines, corresponding to diagnoses, treatments and
investigations. In addition to zooming time scale
and detail-on-demand functionality, the navigator
provides interactive visualization of semantical
relationships between events (e.g., caused-by, has-
locus, indicated-by, etc.). Having different features
from the LifeLines interface, the navigator also
allows the user to visualize numerical data (e.g.,
results of blood tests) by plotting results of meas-
urements on separate line charts. Natural language
generation is used for two purposes: 1) to create
customized textual reports for printing or exchange
purposes and 2) as a support tool for the visual
navigator, to enable better description of complex
events and relationships between them.
KNAVE-II
KNAVE-II (Goren-Bar et al., 2004) is an interface
enabling knowledge-based visualization and inter-
active exploration of time-oriented data at different
levels of temporal abstractions (e.g., abstraction of
periods of bone marrow toxicity from raw individ-
ual hematological data). Users can navigate
through the links of a semantic network while si-
multaneously navigating visually through multiple
degrees of temporal abstraction of the dataset un-
der observation. The evaluation results have shown
that users of KNAVE-II were able to perform que-
ries both faster and more accurately than with other
standard tools.

TimeLine
The TimeLine system (Bui et al., 2007) is a prob-
lem-centric temporal visualization of patient re-
cords. The contents of the EHR are integrated,
reorganized, and displayed within the user inter-
face (UI) along a timeline. It is similar to Lifelines
in the way that the different elements of the EHR
are grouped along the y-axis: imaging, reports, lab
tests, etc are collapsible categories. However, un-
like Lifelines, the TimeLine system uses an XML
data representation to handle data from distributed,
heterogeneous medical databases. Data elements
that are displayed in the UI are classified based on
a knowledge base that guides both data inclusion
rules and the visualization metaphors used to ren-
der the data.

ASBRUVIEW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988655">
AsbruView (Kosara and Miksch, 2001) is a visu-
alization and user interface on top of Asbru lan-
guage (Shahar et al., 1996) designed to represent
treatment procedures as structured time-oriented
plans. AsbruView represents hierarchical and tem-
poral relationships between treatment plans using a
3D visualization perspective. Plans are aligned
along the time axis and can be stacked on top of
each other and laid out in different ways. To sim-
plify the interface, all graphic elements are repre-
sented by well-known real world objects (e.g.,
track, traffic light, etc.). Also a 2D view is avail-
able which focuses on temporal aspects of plans in
greater detail. To depict uncertainty of future
events, AsbruView extends the timeline by using
time annotation glyphs (Chuah, 1997).

Infovis techniques are a way of augmenting human
cognitive capabilities, to help humans find patterns
in large volumes of data. The systems described
above target specific user types that will benefit
from the visualization methods. While some user
interfaces were developed in close dialog with
medical practitioners, like Lifelines2 and Knave-II,
others, such as the first Lifelines, Clef and Asbru-

These systems were designed with input from only
a few medical personnel involved in the project. In
general, articles we read concerning these systems
that have a more guided development process, i.e.
closely related with physicians, have more specific
goals and tasks, because they were designed with
these in mind. Visualizing data for decision-
making and analyzing treatment outcome is often a
general goal in many of the tools developed in in-
teraction with medical staff (Aigner and Miksch,
2006; Mamykina et al., 2004; Portet, 2009). There
is an emphasis on pre-processed patient data, spe-
cifically numeric, such as lab tests, heart rate, and
blood pressure. Systems mainly try to help physi-
cians answer questions about correlations in the
patient&apos;s data, and provide a means for supporting
quick decision-making making when combining
several types of highly heterogeneous data. Physi-
cians can follow a specific treatment plan and
check the patient&apos;s physiological variables over
time. This also enables the practitioner to check the
influence of certain variables in the treatment
process and change the protocol if needed. CLEF,
for example, allows the physician to discover
events during specific time spans, such as search-
ing for past specific liver problems. Lifelines2 is
specifically geared towards research uses and to-
wards answering complex queries. In Lifelines2, a
case study involved verifying the results of a clini-
cal study with real-life EHR data to see if clinical
care data differ from the study results.
The systems we discuss have conducted evaluation
studies as a part of the end-stages of development.
The Lifelines evaluations were conducted in an-
other domain (use of pattern searching related to
monitoring graduate student progress), with limited
interviews and input from experts in the medical
domain. The KNAVE system conducted a cross-
The focus of this paper is on temporal visualization
methods since this has been the primary visualiza-
tion type studied for aiding humans in organizing
and exploring patterns in abstracted EHR content.
All the systems that are compared in this paper
display some type of timeline with time running
from the left part the screen to the right, time being
on the x-axis, and categories of events along the y-
axis. Various techniques for graphically represent-
ing specific events are used (e.g. icons, shapes),
AsbruView makes use of 3D, while all the others
are flat 2D.
Infovis has been the keyword used to describe
these systems, with the idea of presenting a method
for human users (most often stated as being clini-
cians), to recognize patterns and thereby &amp;quot;amplify
cognition&amp;quot; (Chittaro, 2006). Other methods for
recognizing patterns in EHR for secondary use are
purely automated and conducted through data min-
ing techniques. Bertini and Lalanne (2009) wrote
about the complementary role of automatic data
analysis and visualization in knowledge discovery.
They discuss &amp;quot;visual analytics&amp;quot;, an outgrowth of
infovis that can be seen as an integrated approach
combining visualization, human factors, and data
analysis. They suggest 4 categories for classifying
approaches: Pure Visualization (VIS), Computa-
tionally-enhanced Visualization (V++), Visually
enhanced Mining (M++), and Integrated Visualiza-
tion and Mining (VM). In the systems we have
compared, there is a spectrum of ideas about how
to visualize EHR contents, including movements
towards &amp;quot;enhanced&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot; in the proc-
essing of the underlying EHR data. In Lifelines2,
the data visualized was obtained from anonymized
EHRs though cooperation with the i2b2 Project
(Murphy et al., 2006) The input form of the data is
a simple 3-column table containing &amp;quot;ID&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Event
Type&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;. Each ID can have multiple
events happening at various times. Lifelines2 al-
lows sorting of the data so that records with the

most incidents of one type of event are shown at
the top of the screen. This type of infovis relies on
human pattern recognition only and would be con-
sidered as &amp;quot;VIS&amp;quot; by Bertini and Lalanne (2009). In
the CLEF project, the CLEF Chronicle, which un-
derlies the visualizations, is a semantic network
modeling of what happened to the patient, why,
and how. Semantic relations are: causality, reason,
finding, and consequence. The types of events
modeled are: problem, investigation, and treat-
ment. The CLEF Visual Navigator might be con-
sidered as &amp;quot;V++&amp;quot;, computationally enhanced
visualization because some sort of automated com-
putation supports the visualization. In CLEF, the
visual display is &amp;quot;enhanced with visual techniques
for highlighting relationships between events on
the timeline.&amp;quot; None of the systems so far that we
have seen, would qualify as &amp;quot;visually enhanced
mining&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;integrated visualization and mining.&amp;quot;
Table 3 provides a full overview for all systems
reviewed.

The papers we have read that cover EHR visualiza-
tion, as seen in the systems presented, express the
complexity of abstracted EHR data. Missing and
inconsistent data, dealing with hierarchical data,
and problems with granularity are all concerns that
become readily apparent through attempting to
build infovis systems. Wang (2008) summed it up
best &amp;quot;Clinical data tend to be messy with aspects
that become only obvious when the data is visual-
ized. The same heart attack might be recorded
three times in three days (by the emergency room
physician, a cardiologist, and a clerk from the bill-
ing office) and it can be hard to differentiate it
from 3 separate events. Even if medical event in-
formation is carefully recorded at the time of the
doctor visit or during a hospitalization, the time
stamp is usually inaccurate by nature.&amp;quot; Future
work on visualizations needs to adequately address
the complexity of the data rather than work with
test data that is too simplistic.

3.3 Text Mining Tasks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999662193548387">
All mentioned systems, except the CLEF and
TimeLine, operate with readily available lists of
type- and time-tagged events. However, clinical
records are often stored in textual form what makes
them inaccessible for machine processing. Text
mining techniques need to be applied to automati-
cally transform textual data into structured, nor-
malized form. Key tasks involve event extraction,
classification and normalization.
The CLEF system uses an advanced information
extraction engine to identify pre-defined classes of
entities (e.g. diseases, investigations, problems,
drugs, etc.) and semantic relationships between
them (e.g. investigation indicates problem) in natu-
ral language texts. The information extraction
process involves lexical and terminological analy-
sis, syntactic and semantic analysis, and discourse
analysis. To address the complexity of medical
language, the system makes use of language re-
sources including the Unified Medical Language
System and the Gene Ontology. Extracted informa-
tion is stored in templates, which can be queued or
used to generate textual summaries. The TimeLine
system makes use of both textual contents of the
EHR as well as numerical data and codes. An
NLP-based system is used in conjunction with the
TimeLine UI, for example, performing section
analysis in radiology reports to determine whether
specific subsections exist within the reports that
are related to certain medical problems (Bui et al.
2007).

The infovis systems analyzed allow secondary use
of EHR content data especially aimed at clinicians
documenting patient care. All of them are focused
on visualizing temporal data in a timeline, while
displaying specific events from the patient data.
Although directed at medical practitioners in their
daily patient care routine, they were not always
developed with user feedback. Evaluation of the
different tools was often based on situations out-
side of the clinical setting, and might not reflect
reality. A more intimate dialog with clinicians
would benefit the creation of targeted systems ad-
dressing specific needs of the medical community.
The overall goal of these tools is to present users
temporal information contained in a record, im-
proving their ability to recognize patterns for
knowledge discovery and following treatment.
They introduce simple visualization tools, but
some include automated computational enhance-
ments supporting it.
EHR contain missing and inconsistent data, which
is in general messy. Due to the complexity of the
underlying data, future work needs to address these
intricacies rather than using simplistic approaches.

The systems discussed all make use of timelines: Lifelines, Lifelines2, KNAVE II, CLEF Visual Navigator, Timeline, and AsbruView. With the exception of Lifelines2, the main user groups targeted are physicians involved in direct patient care. Little attention has been paid towards supporting true secondary use of EHR contents, for activities such as assessing quality of care, patient health and safety monitoring, and clinical trial recruitment. Future work on such systems needs to address the complexity of EHR data, missing and incomplete information, and difficulties in displaying data with differing levels of granularity.</abstract>

It is usually the case that only clinicians and other healthcare professionals with direct responsibility for providing care have access to patient data. The suggestion of secondary use of health data is not new and has been handled separately from the issue of creating user interfaces and visualizations. Safran et al. discuss the purpose of clinical data repositories in their white paper and point towards the goal of a national framework for the secondary use of health data in the U.S. (Safran et al., 2007). According to their definition, secondary use includes activities such as analysis, research, quality and safety measurement, public health, payment, provider certification and accreditation, marketing, and general business applications, while at the same time taking into account the ethical, political, technical and social implications of such re-use.

However, unlike Lifelines, the TimeLine system uses an XML data representation to handle data from distributed, heterogeneous medical databases. Data elements that are displayed in the UI are classified based on a knowledge base that guides both data inclusion rules and the visualization metaphors used to render the data. Figure 3. TimeLine system. ASBRUVIEW AsbruView (Kosara and Miksch, 2001) is a visualization and user interface on top of Asbru language (Shahar et al., 1996) designed to represent treatment procedures as structured time-oriented plans. AsbruView represents hierarchical and temporal relationships between treatment plans using a 3D visualization perspective. Plans are aligned along the time axis and can be stacked on top of each other and laid out in different ways. To simplify the interface, all graphic elements are represented by well-known real world objects (e.g., track, traffic light, etc.). Also a 2D view is available which focuses on temporal aspects of plans in greater detail. To depict uncertainty of future events, AsbruView extends the tim</context>

Color notations and line thickness are used to indicate the importance and relationship of events. To handle regions with high data density, LifeLines provides zooming functionality allowing users to compress and stretch the time scale at any location. Additional content (e.g., multimedia) can be added in a linked fashion. Authors apply LifeLines in the analysis of complex patient medical records to visualize temporal relationships between treatments, consultations, disorders, prescriptions, hospitalizations and other events. Lifelines2 LifeLines2 (Wang et al., 2008) is an extension of LifeLines, allowing the user to analyze records from multiple patients at a time. The system facilitates comparative visualization of records by 77 means of aligning, filtering and sorting operations. By aligning patient records on some common reference event (e.g., the first heart attack), users can easily spot co-occurring and neighboring events. Ranking and filtering operations complement alignment by interactively reordering or narrowing the set of records to suit a user’s changing focus. The system proved to be particularly suitable for observational research, where re</context>

Evaluation studies showed that the system significantly simplifies typical analytical tasks and that medical specialists can quickly learn the interface. LifeLines2 is currently used to display EHR data provided by the Informatics for Integrating Biology &amp; the Bedside (i2b2) Project (Murphy et al., 2006). While in LifeLines2 the main focus is on visualizing temporal ordering of events, Wang et al. emphasizes practical need in viewing multiple records as an aggregate in order to study frequency of event data over time (Wang et al., 2009). For instance, a user might be interested to analyze blood pressure of all patients who have had an open-heart surgery within 3 months of their first heart attack. As a solution, authors complement LifeLines2 framework with a new visualization technique, called temporal summaries, which represents distributional trends of events over a set of records in a histogram-like chart. Furthermore, the system allows splitting the whole dataset of records into multiple subsets and use temporal summaries to compare event patterns between these groups. Figure 1.
