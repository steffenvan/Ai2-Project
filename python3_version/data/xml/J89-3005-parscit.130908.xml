This volume contains 18 papers and the positions pre-
sented at two panel sessions. The papers are rather
heterogeneous and the editors have not classified them
in any way.
The collection shows clearly the fast proliferation of
new logic grammars and Prolog dialects, which is per-
haps a necessary stage for a relatively new domain.
Some of the modifications are small enough to be fully
described in short Prolog listings accompanying the
papers, e.g., the functional logic grammar of Michel
Boyer or the epistemic reasoning of Manny Rayner and
Sverker Janson; in other cases we have quite large
systems practically unavailable to other parties, e.g.,
the three parsers compared by Toshiyuki Okunishi and
his colleagues. Some papers take a specific linguistic
theory or formalism as a starting point, e.g., Govern-
ment-Binding theory or Sowa&apos;s Conceptual Graphs,
while others augment existing logic grammar or pro-
gramming tools. A paper on morphological analysis of
Italian is an example of the work where it is fully
justified to use Prolog, but its use is of little relevance to
the problem under consideration.
According to my understanding of logic program-
ming, three papers are most representative of the do-
main. Patrick Saint-Dizier describes Contextual Discon-
tinuous Grammars, which form the next step in the
evolution of logic grammars started by Colmerauer&apos;s
metamorphosis grammar. Secondly, Edward P. Stabler,
Jr. reconstructs in logic a fragment of a linguistic
theory, namely, Government-Binding theory, and trans-
forms it by formally provable steps into a logic program
for parsing. Last but not least, the paper by Annie Gal
and Jack Minker on informative and cooperative an-
swers in data bases shows the advantages of using the
same formalism for representing database integrity con-
straints and natural language semantics.
As for the panels, I sympathize most with Miguel
Filgueiras (&amp;quot;logic programming can only be seen as a
programming methodology and not as a formalism con-
tributing to the study of natural language understand-
ing&amp;quot;) and Stan Szpakowicz (&amp;quot;the belief in Prolog as a
perfect tool for natural language processing may some-
times mean putting the cart before the horse&amp;quot;) but they
seemed to be in a minority.
To summarize, the volume definitely proves the
usefulness of the Prolog programming language for a
wide range of natural language processing tasks. It gives
the reader a fair account of the activities in the domain,
but leaves also some doubts as to whether the domain is
more coherent than, say, natural language understand-
ing and Lisp programming.

In this book, Herskovits proposes an analysis of loca-
tive expressions in English. Her goal is to position the
study of linguistic expressions (in particular, spatial
expressions) within a broader context of language usage
and the conventions associated with communicating
goals, beliefs, etc. Thus the work should be evaluated
from the perspective of cognitive science as an interdis-
ciplinary field, and not simply as a linguistic treatise on
prepositions or a computational model of a subset of
natural language.
The underlying semantic theory that Herskovits as-
sumes differs from more traditional &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; ap-
proaches to meaning (e.g., Tarski 1943) and is most
similar to the positions argued for by Searle (1979) and
Winograd (1980), and previously by Wittgenstein
(1963). According to these authors, the view that mean-
ing derives from the literal interpretation of the words in
Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 187
Book Reviews Language and Spatial Cognition
an expression is inadequate, and that what is necessary
to understand the polysemy of prepositions (and of all
language) is a theory of background information and
language usage. Herskovits incorporates these aspects
of the anticlassical theory of meaning by introducing
three notions: (1) the ideal meaning of a word; (2) the
way that expressions formed from this word can vary
due to convention; and (3) the pragmatic influences of
tolerance on this meaning. She classifies these influ-
ences according to a series of use types that abstract
these conventions and complete the mapping from the
lexical meaning to usage.
Herskovits argues that the classical theory is inade-
quate and that we need to enrich our descriptive frame-
work with pairings of phrase types together with inter-
pretations of the central cases falling within a use type.
Thus this view denies the standard interpretation of the
compositionality thesis for language.
Another recurrent theme of the book is the distinc-
tion between computational and holistic approaches to
intelligence. The computational metaphor states that a
computer can be programmed to fully understand English
and embody intelligence in general. The anticomputa-
tional position (i.e., holistic thinking), advocated by
Dreyfus (1979) and Winograd and Flores (1986), argues
that no algorithmic specification can be given to em-
body intelligence or linguistic abilities. This view states
that the &amp;quot;background&amp;quot; conditions necessary to under-
stand a sentence in context cannot be completely or
exhaustively encoded into procedures that a machine
can carry out. Furthermore, Winograd and Flores hold
that a language user cannot possibly have a mental
representation of the world that he or she perceives.
Adopting a neo-Heideggerian position on mental activ-
ity, they deny that symbol manipulation plays a role in
our understanding of the world and our use of language.
Herskovits adopts this position to some extent, albeit
with some important exceptions. She agrees with many
linguists and cognitive psychologists that constructional
theory building is essential for revealing generalizations
about the data and for a better understanding of the
phenomena (cf. Goodman 1951, Carnap 1967, Schlick
1918). Furthermore, she adopts a strong &amp;quot;representa-
tional&amp;quot; view on the nature of lexical meaning (closer in
spirit to Lakoff (1987) or Jackendoff (1983)), which is
embedded within a nonrepresentational theory of prag-
matics.
From a linguistic perspective, Herskovits makes the
following theoretical claims:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9297744">
1. Spatial prepositions (henceforth SPs) have ideal
meanings associated with them in their lexical
entries.
2. The ways in which this meaning is convention-
ally exploited—that is, the canonical usage types
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.987162431818182">
for a word—are also stored in the lexicon with
the preposition.
There are two types of deviations from the ideal mean-
ing of a term: convention-based shifting (resulting in
polysemy), and pragmatic processes of tolerance, to
allow something to be almost true.
From a computational perspective, we can evaluate
the book in a slightly different way. There are three
specific proposals made in the work, the first concern-
ing representation, the other two concerning analysis
and generation. Although largely programmatic, Hersk-
ovits&apos;s computational model amounts to a generate-
and-test paradigm for semantic interpretation and a
mixture of plan-based and lexical decomposition ap-
proaches to generation.
Finally, from a psychological point of view, the work
can be seen as arguing in favor of a &amp;quot;prototype&amp;quot; theory
of categorization (Rosch 1977), where Herskovits&apos;s
notion of ideal meaning is close to a prototype, although
she claims that there are important differences between
the two concepts.
Turning to the details of her theory: Herskovits&apos;s
study is organized into three parts. She first presents a
descriptive framework for studying spatial prepositions.
This is followed by a discussion of computer models for
the data presented in the first section. Finally, she
discusses four case studies, involving the prepositions
in, on, at, and the projective prepositions (e.g., behind,
to the right, etc.).
The basic view can be summarized as follows. There
is an ideal meaning of a preposition, which is a geomet-
rical idea. From this geometrical idea, all uses of that
preposition are derived by means of operations involv-
ing adaptations and shifts in this meaning. The ideal
meaning itself is defined as a relation between &amp;quot;ideal
geometric objects&amp;quot; such as point, line, surface, etc.
Together with this meaning is a set of constraints
Herskovits calls the &amp;quot;normal situation type.&amp;quot; This is
the abovementioned set of central cases falling within
the use type. Although it is left somewhat vague, these
situation types appear to be associated with full expres-
sions and not simply with individual lexical items.
There are two ways for the meaning of an expression
to shift. Consider first what Herskovits calls sense
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6795726">
shifts: Assume that on carries the meaning of &amp;quot;support
and contiguity.&amp;quot; This describes the situation in (la) but
not (lb).
1. a. the book on the table
b. the wrinkles on his forehead
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999142111111111">
Yet the situation in (lb) resembles the ideal meaning of
on in some way, even though no support is involved.
Such a resemblance is related by a sense shift. Another
way that the ideal meaning can shift is by &amp;quot;tolerance.&amp;quot;
For example, consider the locative expression in (la)
again. This would not be strictly appropriate with the
ideal meaning of on if there were a tablecloth between
the table and the book. But we obviously allow such
fuzziness in the description of situations. In such cases,

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97654680952381">
we say that the meaning of the expression has shifted
due to tolerance.
The ideal meaning of a preposition does not itself
map directly onto the world. Rather, Herskovits argues
for an intermediate level of geometric conceptualiza-
tion, where geometric description functions map loca-
tive descriptions onto objects. In other words, these
geometric functions determine what the preposition
contributes to the meaning of a particular situation.
Very often this might be the space occupied by the
object, its &amp;quot;place.&amp;quot; Obviously, the way that an object
relates to a space will depend on the object. Table, for
example, identifies its space very differently from wa-
ter. With the former, the space is bounded and definite,
while the latter is unbounded and indefinite.
2. a. the lamp on the table
b. the child in the water
It is this function that distinguishes between solid
objects, liquid objects, geometric objects, holes, etc.
Herskovits describes six other geometric descriptive
functions (cf. Talmy 1978) including:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.969577125">
3. a. parts (e.g., edges, bases, surfaces, 3-D parts,
etc.)

surface, or plane)
c. good forms

e. axes
f. projections
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.931158285714286">
As an example, consider the interpretation of the
expression in (4).
4. the bird in the tree
There is a function, good-form, that provides the Ge-
stalt closure on tree such that a bird can be contained in
the space occupied by that form. The resulting interpre-
tation looks something like (5).

<bodyText confidence="0.99052402247191">
The major claim Herskovits is making here is that a
simple spatial interpretation of locative prepositions is
inadequate for capturing the variety of meanings carried
by these words. Instead, we need to talk in terms of how
we conceptualize objects, in terms of their geometric
and spatial extensions.
This view is related to that presented in some detail
in Hayes&apos;s discussion (1985) of a naive physics for
liquids. It is also similar in spirit to Moravcsik&apos;s (1981)
interpretation of the &amp;quot;aitiae&amp;quot; associated with objects.
After presenting the framework for the representa-
tion of spatial prepositions, Herskovits turns to the two
problems of decoding and encoding. The decoding
problem can be stated as follows: Given a locative
expression used in a particular situation, how can we
predict what it conveys? The encoding problem is
similarly stated: Given a situation with two spatial
objects, how can we best describe the spatial relation
obtaining between the two objects? These are simply
the problems of interpretation and generation of spatial
expressions.
Most computational approaches to lexical disambig-
uation involved some mechanism of selection among
alternative word senses. Discovering the associations
between one sense of a word and the rest of the
expression will help in the disambiguation of the overall
expression. This can be accomplished in any number of
ways, including marker passing (Charniak 1983, Hirst
1987), message passing (Rieger and Small 1979), prefer-
ence semantics (Wilks 1975), and collative semantics
(Fass 1986). Herskovits implicitly assumes that senses
are generated and matched according to the context and
situational constraints. However, she leaves the partic-
ular computational mechanisms for the decoding of
spatial expressions underspecified and unclear. It would
have been helpful to see how her procedure for obtain-
ing a context-specific interpretation can be made more
explicit, so that it can be compared to some of the
approaches mentioned above. As a result, the reader is
left intrigued but unsatisfied with the details of the
computational aspects of the proposal.
The discussion of how locative expressions are en-
coded is also rather programmatic and unclear. The
problems of text planning and lexical selection in the
generation process have been actively addressed by
many researchers (cf. McDonald (1987) for a review),
yet there is little mention of this work. Therefore, much
of her proposal seems unconnected to this line of
research. Given her philosophical assumptions, for ex-
ample, it is possible that Herskovits envisages a sys-
temic-based formalism (Halliday 1985) for generating
spatial descriptions. This, in fact, seems consistent with
her discussion of the functional role of the different
expressions and the way that they will affect the com-
municative act. Yet, she describes how Appelt&apos;s plan-
based approach (1985) might be employed to handle the
higher-level aspects of planning locative expressions.
Perhaps these approaches are consistent, but it is not at
all clear from her short treatment of the topic.
The book concludes with several fairly detailed case
studies of how so many different expressions can be
derived from the same preposition, due to adaptation
and tolerance shifts. I found this discussion very enjoy-
able and the observations quite detailed for the prepo-
sitions that she covers. A comparison with Jackendoff&apos;s
proposal (1983) for the representation of prepositions,
however, seems in order. Herskovits generally dis-
misses Jackendoff&apos;s work as not accounting for the
roles of motivation and convention for locative expres-
sions. Yet few linguists have done as much as Jacken-
doff to link specific linguistic tokens and expressions in
a language to the conceptual (i.e., geometric descrip-
tive) representations underlying them.
In her book, Herskovits has attempted to provide an

interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of spatial
prepositions. The result is an intriguing, sometimes
incomplete, often speculative account of how language
and space are related. Often the guiding philosophical
maxims are contradicted by assumptions made later in
the book. For example, the ideal meanings of words
often appear to be Platonic objects, something obvi-
ously inconsistent with the tenets in the preface of the
book. Elsewhere, the geometric description functions
seem to embody mental representations, a view not
comfortably condoned by a neo-Heideggerian analysis.
In general, however, the work is an enjoyable and
well-written foray into a very basic subset of language.

There is wide agreement that domain knowledge plays
an important role in natural language processing sys-
tems, and, at the same time, that acquisition of domain
knowledge is an extremely difficult problem. The work
under review offers a rigorous method for knowledge
acquisition in scientific and technical domains, based on
a formal analysis of the texts written by domain experts.
The set of texts in a restricted domain is known as a
sublanguage. The method, which may be termed sub-
language analysis, reveals a formal structure in the
sentences of the texts, sublanguage formulas, which are
similar to the formulas of logic, but with certain exten-
sions (which will be described below).
The sublanguage formulas described by the authors
constitute a form of knowledge representation, and
suggest interesting possibilities for the design of flexible
and expressive databases or knowledge bases. The
strength of the sublanguage approach lies in basing the
knowledge representation on the analysis of actual
texts. The significance of this approach to computa-
tional linguistics is that the initial phase of sublanguage
analysis establishes a direct relationship between sur-
face sentence forms and the semantic representation
(formulas). This mapping serves as a basic design for
text processing algorithms.
A striking feature of the book is that the authors have
carried out a thorough test of their technique on real
data: 14 full-length research articles from the field of
immunology, published in the period 1935-1970. The
formulas obtained and the methods used in producing
them are given in meticulous detail. (The appendices
that give examples of the formulas actually exceed the
length of the narrative portion of the book). The meth-
ods employed are founded on Operator Grammar
(Harris 1982) and are carried out in a general theoretical

Furthermore, Winograd and Flores hold that a language user cannot possibly have a mental representation of the world that he or she perceives. Adopting a neo-Heideggerian position on mental activity, they deny that symbol manipulation plays a role in our understanding of the world and our use of language. Herskovits adopts this position to some extent, albeit with some important exceptions. She agrees with many linguists and cognitive psychologists that constructional theory building is essential for revealing generalizations about the data and for a better understanding of the phenomena (cf. Goodman 1951, Carnap 1967, Schlick Furthermore, she adopts a strong &amp;quot;representational&amp;quot; view on the nature of lexical meaning (closer in spirit to Lakoff (1987) or Jackendoff (1983)), which is embedded within a nonrepresentational theory of pragmatics. From a linguistic perspective, Herskovits makes the following theoretical claims: 1. Spatial prepositions (henceforth SPs) have ideal meanings associated with them in their lexical entries. 2. The ways in which this meaning is conventionally exploited—that is, the canonical usage types for a word—are also stored in the lexicon with the preposition. There are two types of deviations from the ideal meaning of a term: convention-based shifting (resulting in polysemy), and pragmatic processes of tolerance, to allow something to be almost true. perspective, we can evaluate the book in a slightly different way. There are three specific proposals made in the work, the first concerning representation, the other two concerning analysis and generation. Although largely programmatic, Herskovits&apos;s computational model amounts to a generateand-test paradigm for semantic interpretation and a mixture of plan-based and lexical decomposition approaches to generation. Finally, from a psychological point of view, the work can be seen as arguing in favor of a &amp;quot;prototype&amp;quot; theory of categorization (Rosch 1977), where Herskovits&apos;s notion of ideal meaning is close to a prototype, although she claims that there are important differences between the two concepts. Turning to the details of her theory: Herskovits&apos;s study is organized into three parts. She first presents a descriptive framework for studying spatial prepositions. This is followed by a discussion of computer models for the data presented in the first section. Finally, she discusses four case studies, involving the prepositions on, at, the projective prepositions (e.g., the right, The basic view can be summarized as follows. There an ideal meaning of a preposition, which is a geometrical idea. From this geometrical idea, all uses of that preposition are derived by means of operations involving adaptations and shifts in this meaning. The ideal meaning itself is defined as a relation between &amp;quot;ideal geometric objects&amp;quot; such as point, line, surface, etc. Together with this meaning is a set of constraints Herskovits calls the &amp;quot;normal situation type.&amp;quot; This is the abovementioned set of central cases falling within the use type. Although it is left somewhat vague, these situation types appear to be associated with full expressions and not simply with individual lexical items. There are two ways for the meaning of an expression to shift. Consider first what Herskovits calls sense Assume that the meaning of &amp;quot;support and contiguity.&amp;quot; This describes the situation in (la) but not (lb). 1. a. the book on the table b. the wrinkles on his forehead Yet the situation in (lb) resembles the ideal meaning of some way, even though no support is involved. Such a resemblance is related by a sense shift. Another way that the ideal meaning can shift is by &amp;quot;tolerance.&amp;quot; For example, consider the locative expression in (la) again. This would not be strictly appropriate with the meaning of there were a tablecloth between the table and the book. But we obviously allow such fuzziness in the description of situations. In such cases, 188 Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 Book Reviews Language and Spatial Cognition we say that the meaning of the expression has shifted due to tolerance. The ideal meaning of a preposition does not itself map directly onto the world. Rather, Herskovits argues for an intermediate level of geometric conceptualization, where geometric description functions map locative descriptions onto objects. In other words, these geometric functions determine what the preposition contributes to the meaning of a particular situation. Very often this might be the space occupied by the object, its &amp;quot;place.&amp;quot; Obviously, the way that an object to a space will depend on the object. identifies its space very differently from wathe former, the space is bounded and definite, while the latter is unbounded and indefinite. 2. a. the lamp on the table b. the child in the water It is this function that distinguishes between solid objects, liquid objects, geometric objects, holes, etc. Herskovits describes six other geometric descriptive functions (cf. Talmy 1978) including: 3. a. parts (e.g., edges, bases, surfaces, 3-D parts, etc.) b. idealizations (approximations to a point, line, surface, or plane) c. good forms d. volumes e. axes f. projections As an example, consider the interpretation of the expression in (4). 4. the bird in the tree is a function, provides the Geclosure on that a bird can be contained in the space occupied by that form. The resulting interpretation looks something like (5). 5. Included-in (Part (Place (Bird)), Interior (Outline (VisiblePart (Place (Tree))))) The major claim Herskovits is making here is that a simple spatial interpretation of locative prepositions is inadequate for capturing the variety of meanings carried by these words. Instead, we need to talk in terms of how we conceptualize objects, in terms of their geometric and spatial extensions. This view is related to that presented in some detail in Hayes&apos;s discussion (1985) of a naive physics for liquids. It is also similar in spirit to Moravcsik&apos;s (1981) interpretation of the &amp;quot;aitiae&amp;quot; associated with objects. After presenting the framework for the representation of spatial prepositions, Herskovits turns to the two problems of decoding and encoding. The decoding problem can be stated as follows: Given a locative expression used in a particular situation, how can we predict what it conveys? The encoding problem is similarly stated: Given a situation with two spatial objects, how can we best describe the spatial relation obtaining between the two objects? These are simply the problems of interpretation and generation of spatial expressions. Most computational approaches to lexical disambiguation involved some mechanism of selection among alternative word senses. Discovering the associations between one sense of a word and the rest of the expression will help in the disambiguation of the overall expression. This can be accomplished in any number of ways, including marker passing (Charniak 1983, Hirst 1987), message passing (Rieger and Small 1979), preference semantics (Wilks 1975), and collative semantics (Fass 1986). Herskovits implicitly assumes that senses are generated and matched according to the context and situational constraints. However, she leaves the particular computational mechanisms for the decoding of spatial expressions underspecified and unclear. It would have been helpful to see how her procedure for obtaining a context-specific interpretation can be made more explicit, so that it can be compared to some of the approaches mentioned above. As a result, the reader is left intrigued but unsatisfied with the details of the computational aspects of the proposal. The discussion of how locative expressions are encoded is also rather programmatic and unclear. The problems of text planning and lexical selection in the generation process have been actively addressed by many researchers (cf. McDonald (1987) for a review), yet there is little mention of this work. Therefore, much of her proposal seems unconnected to this line of research. Given her philosophical assumptions, for example, it is possible that Herskovits envisages a systemic-based formalism (Halliday 1985) for generating spatial descriptions. This, in fact, seems consistent with her discussion of the functional role of the different expressions and the way that they will affect the communicative act. Yet, she describes how Appelt&apos;s planbased approach (1985) might be employed to handle the higher-level aspects of planning locative expressions. Perhaps these approaches are consistent, but it is not at all clear from her short treatment of the topic. The book concludes with several fairly detailed case studies of how so many different expressions can be derived from the same preposition, due to adaptation and tolerance shifts. I found this discussion very enjoyable and the observations quite detailed for the prepositions that she covers. A comparison with Jackendoff&apos;s proposal (1983) for the representation of prepositions, however, seems in order. Herskovits generally dismisses Jackendoff&apos;s work as not accounting for the roles of motivation and convention for locative expressions. Yet few linguists have done as much as Jackendoff to link specific linguistic tokens and expressions in a language to the conceptual (i.e., geometric descriptive) representations underlying them. In her book, Herskovits has attempted to provide an Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 189 Book Reviews The Form of Information in Science: Analysis of an Immunology Sublanguage interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of spatial prepositions. The result is an intriguing, sometimes incomplete, often speculative account of how language and space are related. Often the guiding philosophical maxims are contradicted by assumptions made later in the book. For example, the ideal meanings of words often appear to be Platonic objects, something obviously inconsistent with the tenets in the preface of the book. Elsewhere, the geometric description functions seem to embody mental representations, a view not comfortably condoned by a neo-Heideggerian analysis. In general, however, the work is an enjoyable and well-written foray into a very basic subset of language.</abstract>

Adopting a neo-Heideggerian position on mental activity, they deny that symbol manipulation plays a role in our understanding of the world and our use of language. Herskovits adopts this position to some extent, albeit with some important exceptions. She agrees with many linguists and cognitive psychologists that constructional theory building is essential for revealing generalizations about the data and for a better understanding of the phenomena (cf. Goodman 1951, Carnap 1967, Schlick 1918). Furthermore, she adopts a strong &amp;quot;representational&amp;quot; view on the nature of lexical meaning (closer in spirit to Lakoff (1987) or Jackendoff (1983)), which is embedded within a nonrepresentational theory of pragmatics. From a linguistic perspective, Herskovits makes the following theoretical claims: 1. Spatial prepositions (henceforth SPs) have ideal meanings associated with them in their lexical entries. 2. The ways in which this meaning is conventionally exploited—that is, the canonical usage types for a word—are also stored in the lexicon with the preposition. There are two types of deviati</context>

These are simply the problems of interpretation and generation of spatial expressions. Most computational approaches to lexical disambiguation involved some mechanism of selection among alternative word senses. Discovering the associations between one sense of a word and the rest of the expression will help in the disambiguation of the overall expression. This can be accomplished in any number of ways, including marker passing (Charniak 1983, Hirst 1987), message passing (Rieger and Small 1979), preference semantics (Wilks 1975), and collative semantics (Fass 1986). Herskovits implicitly assumes that senses are generated and matched according to the context and situational constraints. However, she leaves the particular computational mechanisms for the decoding of spatial expressions underspecified and unclear. It would have been helpful to see how her procedure for obtaining a context-specific interpretation can be made more explicit, so that it can be compared to some of the approaches mentioned above. As a result, the reader is left intrigued but unsatisfied with the details of the computational aspects of the pro</context>

Thus this view denies the standard interpretation of the compositionality thesis for language. Another recurrent theme of the book is the distinction between computational and holistic approaches to intelligence. The computational metaphor states that a computer can be programmed to fully understand English and embody intelligence in general. The anticomputational position (i.e., holistic thinking), advocated by Dreyfus (1979) and Winograd and Flores (1986), argues that no algorithmic specification can be given to embody intelligence or linguistic abilities. This view states that the &amp;quot;background&amp;quot; conditions necessary to understand a sentence in context cannot be completely or exhaustively encoded into procedures that a machine can carry out. Furthermore, Winograd and Flores hold that a language user cannot possibly have a mental representation of the world that he or she perceives.
