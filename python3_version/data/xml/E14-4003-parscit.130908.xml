This study presents the Chinese Open Relation
Extraction (CORE) system that is able to
extract entity-relation triples from Chinese free
texts based on a series of NLP techniques, i.e.,
word segmentation, POS tagging, syntactic
parsing, and extraction rules. We employ the
proposed CORE techniques to extract more
than 13 million entity-relations for an open
domain question answering application. To
our best knowledge, CORE is the first Chinese

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9959302">
Traditional Information Extraction (IE) involves
human intervention of handcrafted rules or
tagged examples as the input for machine
learning to recognize the assertion of a particular
relationship between two entities in texts (Riloff,
1996; Soderland, 1999). Although machine
learning helps enumerate potential relation
patterns for extraction, this approach is often
limited to extracting the relation sets that are
predefined. In addition, traditional IE has
focused on satisfying pre-specified requests from
small homogeneous corpora, leaving the question
open whether it can scale up to massive and
heterogeneous corpora such as the Web (Banko
and Etzioni, 2008; Etzioni et al., 2008, 2011).
Open IE, a new domain-independent
knowledge discovery paradigm that extracts a
diverse set of relations without requiring any
relation-specific human inputs and a pre-
specified vocabulary, is especially suited to
massive text corpora, where target relations are
unknown in advance. Several Open IE systems,
such as TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007), WOE
(Wu and Weld, 2010), ReVerb (Fader et al.,
2011), and OLLIE (Mausam et al., 2012) achieve
promising performance in open relation
extraction on English sentences. However,
application of these systems poses challenges to
those languages that are very different from
English, such as Chinese, as grammatical
functions in English and Chinese are realized in
markedly different ways. It is not sure whether
those techniques for English still work for
Chinese. This issue motivates us to extend the
state-of-the-art Open IE systems to extract
relations from Chinese texts.
The relatively rich morpho-syntactic marking
system of English (e.g., verbal inflection,
nominal case, clausal markers) makes the
syntactic roles of many words detectable from
their surface forms. A tensed verb in English, for
example, generally indicates its main verb status
of a clause. The pinning down of the main verb
in a Chinese clause, on the other hand, must rely
on other linguistic cues such as word context due
to the lack of tense markers. In contrast to the
syntax-oriented English language, Chinese is
discourse-oriented and rich in ellipsis – meaning
is often construable in the absence of explicit
linguistic devices such that many obligatory
grammatical categories (e.g., pronouns and BE
verbs) can be elided in Chinese. For example,
the three Chinese sentences “蘋果營養豐富”
(‘Apples nutritious’), “ 蘋 果 是 營 養 豐 富 的 ”
(‘Apples are nutritious’), and “蘋果富含營養”

(‘Apples are rich in nutrition’) are semantically
synonymous sentences, but the first one, which
lacks an overt verb, is used far more often than
the other two. Presumably, an adequate
multilingual IE system must take into account
those intrinsic differences between languages.
This paper introduces the Chinese Open
Relation Extraction (CORE) system, which
utilizes a series of NLP techniques to extract
relations embedded in Chinese sentences. Given
a Chinese text as the input, CORE employs word
segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and
syntactic parsing, to automatically annotate the
Chinese sentences. Based on this rich
information, the input sentences are chunked and
the entity-relation triples are extracted. Our
evaluation shows the effectiveness of CORE, and
its deficiency as well.

TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007) was the first
Open IE system, which trains a Naïve Bayes
classifier with POS and NP-chunk features to
extract relationships between entities. The
subsequent work showed that employing the
classifiers capable of modeling the sequential
information inherited in the texts, like linear-
chain CRF (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) and
Markov Logic Network (Zhu et al., 2009), can
result in better extraction performance. The
WOE system (Wu and Weld, 2010) adopted
Wikipedia as the training source for their
extractor. Experimental results indicated that
parsed dependency features lead to further
improvements over TextRunner.
ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011) introduced another
approach by identifying first a verb-centered
relational phrase that satisfies their pre-defined
syntactic and lexical constraints, and then split
the input sentence into an Argument-Verb-
Argument triple. This approach involves only
POS tagging for English and “regular
expression”-like matching. As such, it is suitable
for large corpora, and likely to be applicable to
Chinese.
For multilingual open IE, Gamallo et al. (2012)
adopts a rule-based dependency parser to extract
relations represented in English, Spanish,
Portuguese, and Galician. For each parsed
sentence, they separate each verbal clause and
then identify each one’s verb participants,
including their functions: subject, direct object,
attribute, and prepositional complements. A set
of rules is then applied on the clause constituents
to extract the target triples. For Chinese open IE,
we adopt a similar general approach. The main
differences are the processing steps specific to
Chinese language.

3 Chinese Open Relation Extraction
</sectionHeader>

This section describes the components of CORE.
Not requiring any predefined vocabulary,
CORE’s sole input is a Chinese corpus and its
output is an extracted set of relational tuples. The
system consists of three key modules, i.e., word
segmentation and POS tagging, syntactic parsing,
and entity-relation triple extraction, which are
introduced as follows:
Chinese is generally written without word
boundaries. As a result, prior to the
implementation of most NLP tasks, texts must
undergo automatic word segmentation.
Automatic Chinese word segmenters are
generally trained by an input lexicon and
probability models. However, it usually suffers
from the unknown word (i.e., the out-of-
vocabulary, or OOV) problem. In CORE, a
corpus-based learning method to merge the
unknown words is adopted to tackle the OOV
problem (Chen and Ma, 2002). This is followed
by a reliable and cost-effective POS-tagging
method to label the segmented words with part-
of-speeches (Tsai and Chen, 2004). Take the
Chinese sentence “愛迪生發明了燈泡” (‘Edison
invented the light bulb’) for instance. It was
segmented and tagged as follows: 愛迪生/Nb 發
明/VC 了/Di 燈泡/Na. Among these words, the
translation of a foreign proper name “愛迪生”
(‘Edison’) is not likely to be included in a
lexicon and therefore is extracted by the
unknown word detection method. In this case,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995636">
13
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999804842857143">
the special POS tag ‘Di’ is a tag to represent a
verb’s tense when its character “了” follows
immediately after its precedent verb. The
complete set of part-of-speech tags is defined in
the technical report (CKIP, 1993). In the above
sentence, “ 了 ” could represent a complete
different meaning if it is associate with other
character, such as “了解” meaning “understand”.
Therefore, “ 愛 迪 生 發 明 了 解 藥 ” (‘Edison
invented a cure’) would be segmented incorrectly
once “ 了 ” is associated with its following
character, instead of its precedent word.
We adopt CKIP, the best-performing parser in
the bakeoff of SIGHAN 2012 (Tseng et al.,
2012), to do syntactic structure analysis. The
CKIP solution re-estimates the context-
dependent probability for Chinese parsing and
improves the performance of probabilistic
context-free grammar (Hsieh et al., 2012). For
the example sentence above, ‘愛迪生/Nb’ and
‘ 燈 泡 /Na’ were annotated as two nominal
phrases (i.e., ‘NP’), and ‘發明/VC 了/Di’ was
annotated as a verbal phrase (i.e., ‘VP’).
CKIP parser also adopts dependency decision-
making and example-based approaches to label
the semantic role “Head”, showing the status of a
word or a phrase as the pivotal constituent of a
sentence (You and Chen, 2004). CORE adopts
the head-driven principle to identify the main
relation in a given sentence (Huang et al., 2000).
Firstly, a relation is defined by both the “Head”-
labeled verb and the other words in the syntactic
chunk headed by the verb. Secondly, the noun
phrases preceding/preceded by the relational
chunk are regarded as the candidates of the
head’s arguments. Finally, the entity-relation
triple is identified in the form of (entity1, relation,
entity2). Regarding the example sentence
described above, the triple (愛迪生/Edison, 發明
了/invented, 燈泡/light bulb) is extracted by this
approach.
Figure 1 shows the parsed tree of a Chinese
sentence for the relation extraction by CORE.
The Chinese sentence “白宮預算委員會的民主
黨星期一發佈報告” (‘Democrats on the House
Budget Committee released a report on Monday’)
is the manual translation of one of the English
sentences evaluated by ReVerb (Fader et al.,
2011). The first step of CORE involves word-
segmentation and POS-tagging, thus returning
eight word/POS pairs: 白宮/Nc, 預算/Na, 委員
會/Nc, 的/DE, 民主黨/Nb, 星期一/Nd, 發怖/VE,
報告 /Na. Next, “ 星 期 一 /Nd 發 佈 /VE” is
identified as the verbal phrase that heads the
sentence. This verbal phrase is regarded as the
center of a potential relation. The two noun
phrases before and after the verbal phrase, i.e.,
the NP “白宮 預算 委員會 的 民主黨” and NP
“報告” are regarded as the entities that complete
the relation. A potential entity-relation-entity
triple (i.e., 白宮預算委員會的民主黨 / 星期一
發佈 / 報告, ‘Democrats on the House Budget
Committee / on Monday released / a report’) is
extracted accordingly. This triple is chunked
from its original sentence fully automatically.
Finally, a filtering process, which retains
“Head”-labeled words only, can be applied to
strain out from each component of this triple the
most prominent word: “民主黨 / 發佈 / 報告”
(‘Democrats / released / report’).

<bodyText confidence="0.999876285714286">
We adopted the same test set released by ReVerb
for performance evaluation. The test set consists
of 500 English sentences randomly sampled from
the Web and were annotated using a pooling
method. To obtain “gold standard” relation
triples in Chinese, the 500 test sentences were
manually translated from English to Chinese by a
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999473925">
trained native Chinese speaker and verified by
another. Additionally, two other native Chinese
speakers annotated the relation triples for each
Chinese sentence. In total, 716 Chinese entity-
relation triples with an agreement score of 0.79
between the two annotators were obtained and
regarded as gold standard.
Performance evaluation of CORE was
conducted based on: 1) exact match; and 2)
relation-only match. For exact match, each
component of the extracted triple must be
identical with the gold standard. For relation-
only match, the extracted triple is regarded as a
correct case if an extracted relation agreed with
the relation of the gold standard.
Without another Chinese Open IE system for
performance comparison, we compared CORE
with a modification of ReVerb system capable of
handling Chinese sentences. The modification of
ReVerb’s verb-driven regular expression
matching was kept to a minimum to deal with
language-specific processing. As such, ReVerb
remains mostly the same as its English
counterpart so that a bilingual (Chinese/English)
Open IE system can be easily implemented.
Table 1 shows the experimental results. Our
CORE system obviously performs better than
ReVerb when recall is considered for both exact
and relation-only match. The results suggest that
utilizing more sophisticated NLP techniques is
effective to extract relations without any specific
human intervention. In addition, there is a slight
decrease in the precision of exact match for
CORE. This reveals that ReVerb’s original
syntactic and lexical constraints are also useful to
identify the arguments and their relationship
precisely. In summary, CORE achieved
relatively promising F1 scores. These results
imply that CORE method is more suitable for
Chinese open relation extraction.

We also analyzed the errors made by the
CORE model. Almost all the errors resulted from
incorrect parsing. Enhancing the parsing
effectiveness is most likely to improve the
performance of CORE. The relatively low recall
rate also indicates that CORE misses many types
of relation expression. Ellipsis and flexibility in
Chinese syntax are so difficult not only to fail the
parser, but also the extraction attempts to bypass
the parsing errors.
To demonstrate the applicability of CORE, we
implement a Chinese Question-Answering (QA)
system based on two million news articles from
2002 to 2009 published by the United Daily
News Group (udn.com/NEWS). CORE extracted
more than 13 million unique entity-relation
triples from this corpus. These extracted relations
are useful for knowledge acquisition. Take the
question “ ft Pr, ;J,q, P �&apos;,- rP X ? ” (‘What is
originated from China?’) as an example, the
relation is automatically identified as “ ;J,q, ”
(‘originate’) that heads the following entity “rP
X ” (‘China’). Our open QA system then
searched the triples and returned the first entity
as the answers. In addition to the obvious answer
“rP ” (‘Chinese medicine’), which is usually
considered as common-sense knowledge, we also
obtained those that are less known, such as the
traditional Japanese food “6tNff” (‘natto’) and
the musical instrument “���” (‘accordion’).

The CKIP solution re-estimates the contextdependent probability for Chinese parsing and improves the performance of probabilistic context-free grammar (Hsieh et al., 2012). For the example sentence above, ‘愛迪生/Nb’ and ‘ 燈 泡 /Na’ were annotated as two nominal phrases (i.e., ‘NP’), and ‘發明/VC 了/Di’ was annotated as a verbal phrase (i.e., ‘VP’). CKIP parser also adopts dependency decisionmaking and example-based approaches to label the semantic role “Head”, showing the status of a word or a phrase as the pivotal constituent of a sentence (You and Chen, 2004). CORE adopts the head-driven principle to identify the main relation in a given sentence (Huang et al., 2000). Firstly, a relation is defined by both the “Head”- labeled verb and the other words in the syntactic chunk headed by the verb. Secondly, the noun phrases preceding/preceded by the relational chunk are regarded as the candidates of the head’s arguments. Finally, the entity-relation triple is identified in the form of (entity1, relation, entity2). Regarding the example sentence described above, the triple (愛迪生/Edison, 發明 了/invented, 燈泡/light bulb) is extracted by this approach. Figure </context>

As a result, prior to the implementation of most NLP tasks, texts must undergo automatic word segmentation. Automatic Chinese word segmenters are generally trained by an input lexicon and probability models. However, it usually suffers from the unknown word (i.e., the out-ofvocabulary, or OOV) problem. In CORE, a corpus-based learning method to merge the unknown words is adopted to tackle the OOV problem (Chen and Ma, 2002). This is followed by a reliable and cost-effective POS-tagging method to label the segmented words with partof-speeches (Tsai and Chen, 2004). Take the Chinese sentence “愛迪生發明了燈泡” (‘Edison invented the light bulb’) for instance. It was segmented and tagged as follows: 愛迪生/Nb 發 明/VC 了/Di 燈泡/Na. Among these words, the translation of a foreign proper name “愛迪生” (‘Edison’) is not likely to be included in a lexicon and therefore is extracted by the unknown word detection method.
