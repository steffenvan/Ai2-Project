ACL 1988 DUES STATEMENT AND MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION

Institutions Now Order Journals from MIT Press; New LATE PAYMENT FEE for Late Renewals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.7033655">
Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year; it includes the ACL journal
Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored
publications. Beginning in 1988, MIT Press will publish the journal. This change will not affect personal and student
memberships, which will continue to be handled by the ACL; however, institutions now must subscribe to the 1988 journal from
MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142-1399, USA; (617) 253-2889. Back issues through 1987 and
proceedings will continue to be available only from ACL. An order form is on the other side of this statement. The change in pub-
lishing makes it necessary to introduce a late payment fee for renewal payments made after 30 April, because of the extra mailing
costs. Dues and back order payments can be made in Europe and Japan as well as the U.S.; read the directions under the heading
PAYMENT below carefully. Identify your institutional affiliation if it is not part of your address. Also please provide your
computer network address.

ing their national currencies for international transactions. Contributions may be tax-deductible in the United States and in
some other countries; check local regulations.
PAYMENT: Prepayment is necessary; invoices are avilable on request. Checks should be made out to the Association for
Computational Linguistics (or to ACL). Payments can be made to one of the addresses below, as follows:

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.940488119047619">
Manuscripts submitted to Computational Linguistics should be typed on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should
begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted in
English.
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational
linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper
depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty doule-spaced pages. That is the
equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the
editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not
copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any
version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such
publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper
tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by
all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire&amp;quot;, by the employer. This written transfer is necessary
under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results of
some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical
correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence
is reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.
The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:
James F. Allen, CL Editor
Department of Computer Science
The University of Rochester
Rochester, NY 14627
arpanet: ACL@ROCHESTER.ARPA
Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact the Book
Review Editor; publishers may also submit copies of books for review directly to the Book Review Editor:

arpanet: GH@TORONTO.CSNET
The Finite String Editor should receive (a) copies of technical reports and reprints of papers published
elsewhere — or at least citation information and abstracts of such items and of books and monographs; (b)
summaries of research in progress — of particular interest would be perspectives on the activities at a
particular institution; (c) announcements of meetings of potential interest to the membership; and (d)
personal notes (e.g., honors, moving, changes in status). Two copies of submissions should be sent to the
