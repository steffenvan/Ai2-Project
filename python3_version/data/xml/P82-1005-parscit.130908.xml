A desirable long-range goal in building
future speech understanding systems would be to
accept the kind of language people spontaneously
produce. We show that people do not speak to one
another in the same way they converse in
typewritten language. Spoken language is
finer-grained and more indirect. The differences
are striking and pervasive. Current techniques
for engaging in typewritten dialogue will need to
be extended to accomodate the structure of spoken
language.

I. INTRODUCTION

If a machine could listen, how would we talk
to it? This question will be hard to answer
definitively until a good mechanical listener is
developed. As a next best approximation, this
paper presents results of an exploration of how
people talk to one another in a domain for which
keyboard-based natural language dialogue systems
would be desirable, and have already been built
(Robinson et al., 1980; Winograd, 1972).
Our observations are based on transcripts of
person-to-person telephone-mediated and
teletype-mediated dialogues. In these
transcripts, one specific kind of communicative
act dominates spoken task-related discourse, but
is nearly absent from keyboard discourse.
Importantly, when this act is performed vocally it
is never performed directly. Since most of the
utterances in these simple dialogues do not signal
the speaker&apos;s intent, techniques for inferring
intent will be crucial for engaging in spoken
task-related discourse. The paper suggests how a
plan-based theory of communication (Cohen and
Perrault, 1979; Perrault and Allen, 1980) can
uncover the intentions underlying the use of
various forms.

This research was supported by the National
Institute of Education under contract
US-NIE-C-400-76-0116 to the Center for the Study
of Reading of the University of Illinois and Bolt,
Beranek and Newman, Inc.
Motivated by Rubin&apos;s (1980) taxonomy of
language experiences and influenced by Chapanis et
al.&apos;s (1972, 1977) and Grosz&apos; (1977) communication
mode and task-oriented dialogue studies, we
conducted an exploratory study to investigate how
the structure of instruction-giving discourse
depends on the communication situation in which it
takes place. Twenty-five subjects (&amp;quot;experts&amp;quot;)
each instructed a randomly chosen &amp;quot;apprentice&amp;quot; in
assembling a toy water pump. All subjects were
paid volunteer students from the University of
Illinois. Five &amp;quot;dialogues&amp;quot; took place in each of
the following modalities: face-to-face, via
telephone, teletype (&amp;quot;linked&amp;quot; CRT&apos;s),
(non-interactive) audiotape, and (non-interactive)
written. In all modes, the apprentices were
videotaped as they followed the experts&apos;
instructions. Telephone and Teletype dialogues
were analyzed first since results would have
implications for the design of speech
understanding and production systems.
Each expert participated in the experiment on
two consecutive days, the first for training and
the second for instructing an apprentice.
Subjects playing the expert role were trained by:
following a set of assembly directions consisting
entirely of imperatives, assembling the pump as
often as desired, and then instructing a research
assistant. This practice session took place
face-to-face. Experts knew the research assistant
already knew how to assemble the pump. Experts
were given an initial statement of the purpose of
the experiment, which indicated that communication
would take place in one of.a number of different
modes, but were not informed of which modality
they would communicate in until the next day.
In both modes, experts and apprentices were
located in different rooms. Experts had a set of
pump parts that, they were told, were not to be
assembled but could be manipulated. In Telephone
mode, experts communicated via a standard
telephone and apprentices communicated through a
speaker-phone, which did not need to be held and
which allowed simultaneous two-way communication.
Distortion of the expert&apos;s voice was apparent, but
not measured.
Subjects in &amp;quot;Teletype&amp;quot; (TTY) mode typed their
communication on Elite Datamedia 1500 CRT

terminals connected by the Telenet computer
network to a computer at Bolt, Beranek and Newman,
Inc. The terminals were &amp;quot;linked&amp;quot; so that whatever
was typed on one would appear on the other.
Simultaneous typing was possible and did occur.
Subjects were informed that their typing would not
appear simultaneously on either terminal.
Response times averaged 1 to 2 seconds, with
occasionally longer delays due to system load.

A. Sample Dialogue Fragments
The following are representative fragments of
Telephone and Teletype discourse.
A Telephone Fragment
S: &amp;quot;OK. Take that. Now there&apos;s a thing
called a plunger. It has a red handle
on it, a green bottom, and it&apos;s got a blue
lid.
J: OK
S: OK now, the small blue cap we talked about
before?
J: Yeah
S: Put that over the hole on the side
of that tube --
J: Yeah
S: -- that is nearest to the top, or nearest
to the red handle.
J: OK
S: You got that on the hole?
J: yeah
S: Ok. now, now, the smallest of the red pieces?
J: OK&amp;quot;

Communication in Telephone mode has a
distinct pattern of &amp;quot;find the x&amp;quot; &amp;quot;put it
into/onto/over the y&amp;quot;, in which reference and
predication are addressed in different steps. To
relate these steps, more reliance is placed on
strategies for signalling dialogue coherence, such
as the use of pronouns. Teletype communication
involves primarily the use of imperatives such as
&amp;quot;put the x into/onto/around the y&amp;quot;. Typically,
the first time each object (X) is mentioned in a
TTY discourse is within a request for a physical
action.

B. A Methodology for Discourse Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972881209302326">
This research aims to develop an adequate method
for conducting discourse analysis that will be
useful to the computational linguist. The method
used here integrates psychological, linguistic,
and formal approaches in order to characterize
language use. Psychological methods are needed in
setting up protocols that do not bias the
interesting variables. Linguistic methods are
needed for developing a scheme for describing the
progress of a discourse. Finally, formal methods
are essential for stating theories of utterance
interpretation in context.
To be more specific, we are ultimately interested
in similarities and differences in utterance
processing across modes, Utterance processing
clearly depends on utterance form and the
speaker&apos;s intent. The utterances in the
transcripts are therefore categorized by the
intentions they are used to achieve. Both
utterances and categorizations become data for
cross-modal measures as well as for formal
methods. Once intentions differing across modes
are isolated, our strategy is to then examine the
utterance forms used to achieve those intentions.
Thus, utterance forms are not compared directly
across modes; only utterances used to achieve the
same goals are compared, and it is those goals
that are expected to vary across modes. With form
and function identified, one can then proceed to
discuss how utterance processing may differ from
one mode to another.
Our plan-based theory of speech acts will be used
to explain how an utterance&apos;s intent coding can be
derived from the utterance&apos;s form and the prior
interaction. A computational model of intent
recognition in dialogue (Allen, 1979; Cohen, 1979;
Sidner et al., 1981) can then be used to mimic the
theory&apos;s assignment of intent. Thus, the theory
of speech act interpretation will describe
language use in a fashion analogous to the way
that a generative grammar describes how a
particular deep structure can underlie a given
surface structure.

C. Coding the Transcripts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999643142857143">
The first stage of discourse analysis
involved the coding of the communicator&apos;s intent
in making various utterances. Since attributions
of intent are hard to make reliably, care was
taken to avoid biasing the results. Following the
experiences of Sinclair and Coulthard (1975), Dore
et al. (1978) and Mann et al. (1975), a coding
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997594">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.992295333333333">
scheme was developed and two people trained in its
use. The coders relied both on written
transcripts and on videotapes of the apprentices&apos;
assembly.
The scheme, which was tested and revised on
pilot data until reliability was attained,
Included a set of approximately 20 &amp;quot;speech act&amp;quot;
categories that were used to label intent, and a
set of &amp;quot;operators&amp;quot; and propositions that were used
to describe the assembly task, as in (Sacerdoti,
1975). The operators and propositions often
served as the propositional content of the
communicative acts. In addition to the domain
actions, pilot data led us to include an action of
&amp;quot;physically identifying the referent of a
description&amp;quot; as part of the scheme (Cohen, 1981).
This action will be seen to be requested
explicitly by Telephone experts, but not by
experts in Teletype mode.
Of course, a coding scheme must not only
capture the domain of discourse, it must be
tailored to the nature of discourse per se. Many
theorists have observed that a speaker can use a
number of utterances to achieve a goal, and can
use one utterance to achieve a number of goals.
Correspondingly, the coders could consider
utterances as jointly achieving one intention (by
&amp;quot;bracketing&amp;quot; them), could place an utterance in
multiple categories, and could attribute more than
one intention to the same utterance or utterance
part.
It was discovered that the physical layout of
a transcript, particularly the location of line
breaks, affected which utterances were coded. To
ensure uniformity, each coder first divided each
transcript into utterances that he or she would
code. These joint &amp;quot;bracketings&amp;quot; were compared by
a third party to yield a base set of codable (sic)
utterance parts. The coders could later bracket
utterances differently if necessary.
The first attempt to code the transcripts was
overly ambitious -- coders could not keep 20
categories and their definitions in mind, even
with a written coding manual for reference. Our
scheme was then scaled back -- only utterances
fitting the following categories were considered:
Requests-for-assembly-actions (RAACT)
(e.g., &amp;quot;put that on the hole&amp;quot;.)
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.565484" genericHeader="method">
Requests-for-orientation-actions (RORT)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966655814814815">
(e.g., &amp;quot;the other way around&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the top is the
bottom&amp;quot;.)
Requests-to-pick-up (RPUP)
(e.g., &amp;quot;take the blue base&amp;quot;.)
Requests-for-identification (RID)
(e.g., &amp;quot;there is a little yellow piece
rubber&amp;quot;.)
Requests-for-other (ROTH) •
(e.g., requests for repetition, requests to stop,
etc.)

Interrater reliabilities for each category
(within each mode), measured as the number of
agreements X 2. divided by the number of times that
category was coded, were high (above 90%). Since
each disagreement counted twice (against both
categories that were coded), agreements also
counted twice.
D. Analysis 1: Frequency of Request types
Since most of each dialogue consisted of the
making of requests, the first analysis examined
the frequency of the various kinds of requests in
the corpus of five transcripts for each modality.
Table I displays the findings.

This table supports Chapanis et al.&apos;s (1972,
1977) finding that voice modes were about &amp;quot;twice
as wordy&amp;quot; as non-voice modes. Here, there are
approximately twice as many requests in Telephone
mode as Teletype. Chapanis et al. examined how
linguistic behavior differed across modes in terms
of measures of sentence length, message length,
number of words, sentences, messages, etc.
In contrast, the present study provides
evidence of how these modes differ in utterance
function. Identification requests are much more
frequent in Telephone dialogues than in Teletype
conversations. In fact, they constitute the
largest category of requests.-- fully 35%. Since
utterances in the RORT, RPUP, and ROTH categories
will often be issued to clarify or follow up on a
previous request, it is not surprising they would
increase in number (though not percentage) with
the increase in RID usage. Furthermore, it is
sensible that there are about the same number of
requests for assembly actions (and hence half the
percentage) in each mode since the same &amp;quot;assembly
work&amp;quot; is accomplished. .-yerLfore, identification
requests seem to be the primary request
differentiating the two modalities.
E. Analysis 2: First time identifications
Frequency data are important for
computational linguistics because they indicate
the kinds of utterances a system may have to
</bodyText>

interpret most often. However, frequency data
include mistakes, dialogue repairs, and
repetition. Perhaps identification requests occur
primarily after referential miscommunication (as
occurs for teletype dialogues (Cohen, 1981)). One
might then argue that people would speak more
carefully to machines and thus would not need to
use identification requests frequently.
Alternatively, the use of such requests as a step
in a Telephone speaker&apos;s plan may truly be a
strategy of engaging in spoken . task-related
discourse that is not found in TTY discourse.
TO explore when identification requests were
used, a second analysis of the utterance codings
was undertaken that was limited to &amp;quot;first time&amp;quot;
identifications. Each time a novice (rightly or
wrongly) first identified a piece, the
communicative act that caused him/her to do so was
indicated. However, a coding was counted only if
that speech act was not jointly present with
another prior to the novice&apos;s part identification
attempt. Table II indicates the results for each
subject in Telephone and Teletype modes.
just which forms are used for our task, utterances
classified as requests-for-identification were
tabulated. Table III presents classes of these
utterance, along with an example of each class.
The utterance forms are divided into four major
groups, to be explained below. One class of
utterances comprising 7% of identification
requests, called &amp;quot;supplemental NP&amp;quot; (e.g., &amp;quot;Put
that on the opening in the other large tube.

Subjects were classifed as habitual users of
a communicative act if, out of 12 pieces, the
subject &amp;quot;introduced&amp;quot; at least 9 of the pieces with
that act. In Telephone mode, four of five experts
were habitual users of identification requests to
get the apprentice to find a piece. In Teletype
mode, no experts were habitual users of that act.
TO show a &amp;quot;modality effect&amp;quot; in the use of the
identification request strategy, the number of
habitual users of RID in each mode were subjected
to the Fischer&apos;s exact probability test
(hypergeometric). Even with 5 subjects per mode,
the differences across modes are significant (p =
0.023), indicating that Telephone conversation per
se differs from Teletype conversation in the ways
in which a speaker will make first reference to an
object.

requests are never performed directly. NO speaker
used the paradigmatic direct forms, e.g. &amp;quot;Find
the rubber ring shaped like an 0&amp;quot;, which occurred
frequently in the written modality. However, the
use of indirection is selective -- Telephone
experts frequently use direct imperatives to
perform assembly requests. Only the
identification-request seems to be affected by
modality.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.999587" genericHeader="method">
III. INTERPRETING INDIRECT REQUESTS FOR
REFERENT IDENTIFICATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986369659574468">
Many of the utterance forms can be analyzed
as requests for identification once-an act for
physically searching for the referent of a
description has been posited (Cohen, 1981).
Assume that the action IDENTIFY-REF (AGT,
DESCRIPTION) has as precondition &amp;quot;there exists an
object 0 perceptually accessible to agt such that
0 is the (semantic) reference of DESCRIPTION.&amp;quot; The
result of the action might be labelled by
(IDENTIFIED-REF ?GT DESCRIPTION). Finally, the
means for performing the act will be some
procedural combination of sensory actions (e.g.,
looking) and counting. The exact combination will
depend on the description used. The utterances in
Group A can then be analyzed as requests for
IDENTIFY-REFERENT using Perrault and Allen&apos;s
(1980) method of applying plan recognition to the
definition of communicative acts.
A. Action-based Utterances
Case 1 (&amp;quot;There is a NP&amp;quot;) can be interpreted
as a request that the hearer IDENTIFY-REFERENT of
NP by reasoning that a speaker&apos;s informing a
hearer that a precondition to an action is true
can cause the hearer to believe the speaker wants
that action to be performed. All utterances that
communicate the speaker&apos;s desire that the hearer
do some action are labelled as requests.
Using only rules about action, Perrault and
Allen&apos;s method can also explain why Cases 2, 3,
and 4 all convey requests for referent
identification. Case 2 is handled by an inference
saying that if a speaker communicates that an act
will yield some desired effect, then one can infer
the speaker wants that act performed to achieve
that effect. Case 3 is an example of questioning
a desired effect of an act (e.g., &amp;quot;Is the garbage
out?&amp;quot;) to convey that the act itself is desired.
Case 4 is similar to Case 2, except the
relationship between the desired effect and some
action yielding that effect is presumed.
In all these cases, ACT = LOOK-AT, and EFFECT
= &amp;quot;HEARER SEE X&amp;quot;. Since LOOK-AT is part of the
&amp;quot;body&amp;quot; (Allen, 1979) of IDENTIFY-REFERENT, Allen&apos;s
&amp;quot;body-action&amp;quot; inference will make the necessary
connection, by inferring that the speaker wanted
the hearer to LOOK-AT something as part of his
IDENTIFY-REFERENT act.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.694794">
B. Fragments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999455736842105">
Group B utterances constitute the class of
fragments classified as requests for
Identification. Notice that &amp;quot;fragment&amp;quot; is not a
simple syntactic classification. In Case 2, the
speaker paralinguistically &amp;quot;calls for&amp;quot; a hearer
response in the course of some linguistically
complete utterance. Such examples of parallel
achievement of communicative actions cannot be
accounted for by any linguistic theory or
computational linguistic mechanism of which we are
aware. These cases have been included here since
we believe the theory should be extended to handle
them by reasoning about parallel actions. A
potential source of inspiration for such a theory
would be research on reasoning about concurrent
programs.
Case 1 includes NP fragments, usually with
rising intonation. The action to be performed is
not explicitly stated, but must be supplied on the
basis of shared knowledge about the discourse
situation -- who can do what, who can see what,
what each participant thinks the other believes,
what is expected, etc. Such knowledge will be
needed to differentiate the intentions behind a
traveller&apos;s saying &amp;quot;the 3:15 train to Montreal?&amp;quot;
to an information booth clerk (who is not intended
to turn around and find the train), from those
behind the uttering of &amp;quot;the smallest of the red
pieces?&amp;quot;, where the hearer is expected to
physically identify the piece.
According to the theory, the speaker&apos;s
intentions conveyed by the elliptical question
include 1) the speaker&apos;s wanting to know whether
some relevant property holds of the referent
of the description, and 2) the speaker&apos;s perhaps
wanting that property to hold. Allen and Perrault
(1980) suggest that properties needed to &amp;quot;fill in&amp;quot;
such fragments come from shared expectations (not
just from prior syntactic forms, as is current
practice in computational linguistics). The
property in question in our domain is
IDENTIFIED-REFERENT(HEARER, NP), which is
(somehow) derived from the nature of the task as
one of manual assembly. Thus, expectations have
suggested a starting point for an inference chain
-- it is shared knowledge that the speaker wants
to know whether IDENTIFIED-REFERENT (HEARER, NP).
In the same way that questioning the completion of
an action can convey a request for action,
questioning IDENTIFIED-REFERENT conveys a request
for IDENTIFY-REFERENT (see Case 3, Group A,
above). Thus, our positing an
IDENTIFY-REFERENT act, and by assuming such an act
is expected of the user, the inferential machinery
can derive the appropriate intention behind the
use of a noun phrase fragment.
The theory should account for 48% of the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998191">
32
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.992535225806452">
identification requests in our corpus, and should
be extended to account for an additional 6%. The
next group of utterances cannot now, and perhaps
should not, be handled by a theory of
communication based on reasoning about action.
C. Indirect Requests for Confirmation
Group C utterances (as well as Group A, cases
1, 2, and 4) can be interpreted as requests for
identification by a rule stipulated by Labov and
Fanshel (1977) -- if a speaker ostensibly informs
a hearer about a state-of-affairs for which it is
Shared knowledge that the hearer has better
evidence, then the speaker is actually requesting
confirmation of that state-of-affairs. In
Telephone (and Teletype) modality, it is shared
knowledge that the hearer has the best evidence
for what she &amp;quot;has&amp;quot;, how the pieces are arranged,
etc. %hen the apprentice receives a Group C
utterance, she confirms its truth perceptually
(rather than by proving a theorem), and thereby
identifies the referents of the NP&apos;s in the
utterance.
The indirect request for confirmation rule
accounts for 66% of the identification request
utterances (overlapping with Group A for 35%).
This important rule cannot be explained in the
theory. It seems to derive more from properties
of evidence for belief than it does from a theory
of action. As such, it can only be stipulated to
a rule-based inference mechanism (Cohen, 1979),
rather than be derived from more basic principles.

Group D utterance forms are the closest forms
to direct requests for identification that
appeared, though strictly speaking, they are not
direct requests. Case 1 mentions &amp;quot;Look on&amp;quot;, but
does not indicate a search explicitly. The
interpretation of this utterance in Perrault and
Allen&apos;s scheme would require an additional
&amp;quot;body-action&amp;quot; inference to yield a request for
identification. Case 2 is literally an
informative utterance, though a request could be
derived in one step. Importantly, the frequency
of these &amp;quot;nearest neighbors&amp;quot; is minimal (3%).

E. Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997545402439024">
The act of requesting referent identification
is nearly always performed indirectly in Telephone
mode. This being the case, inferential mechanisms
are needed for uncovering the speaker&apos;s intentions
from the variety of forms with which this act is
performed. A plan-based theory of communication
augmented with a rule for identifying indirect
requests for confirmation would account for 79% of
the identification requests in our corpus. A
hierarchy of communicative acts (including&apos; their
propositional content) can be used to organize
derived rules for interpreting speaker intent
based on utterance form, shared knowledge and
shared expectations (Cohen, 1979). Such a
rule-based system could form the basis of a future
pragmatics/discourse component for a speech
understanding system.
IV. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER STUDIES
These results are similar in some ways to
observations by Ochs and colleagues (Ochs, 1979;
Ochs, Schieffelin, and Pratt, 1979). They note
that parent-child and child-child discourse is
often comprised of &amp;quot;sequential&amp;quot; constructions --
with separate utterances for securing reference
and for predicating. They suggest that language
development should be regarded as an overlaying of
newly-acquired linguistic strategies onto previous
ones. Adults will often revert to developmentally
early linguistic strategies when they cannot
devote the appropriate time/resources to planning
their utterances. Thus, Ochs et al. suggest, when
competent speakers are communicating while
concentrating on a task, one would expect to see
separate utterances for reference and predication.
This suggestion is certainly backed by our corpus,
and is important for computational linguistics
since, to be sure, our systems are intended to be
used in some task.
It is also suggested that the presence of
sequential constructions is tied to the
possibilities for preplanning an utterance, and
hence oral and written discourse would differ in
this way. Our study upholds this claim for
Telephone vs. Teletype, but does not do so for our
Written condition in which many requests for
identification occur as separate steps.
Furthermore, Ochs et al.&apos;s claim does not account
for the use of identification requests in
Teletype modality after prior referential
miscommunication (Cohen, 1981). Thus, it would
seem that sequential constructions can result from
(what they term) planned as well as unplanned
discourse.
It is difficult to compare our results with
those of other studies. Chapanis et al.&apos;s
observation that voice modes are faster and
wordier than teletype modes certainly holds here.
However, their transcripts cannot easily be used
to verify our findings since, for the equipment
assembly problem, their subjects were given a set
of instructions that could be, and often were,
read to the listener. Thus, utterance function
would often be predetermined. Our subjects had to
remember the task and compose the instructions
afresh.
Grosz&apos; (1977) study also cannot be directly
compared for the phenomena of interest here since
the core dialogues that were analyzed in depth
employed a &amp;quot;mixed&amp;quot; communication modality in which
the expert communicated with a third party by
teletype. The third party, located in the same
room as the apprentice, vocally transmitted the
expert&apos;s communication to the apprentice, and
typed the apprentice&apos;s vocal response to the
expert. The findings of finer-grained and
indirect vocal requests would not appear under
these conditions.
Thompson&apos;s (1980) extensive tabulation of
utterance forms in a multiple modality comparison
overlaps our analysis at the level of syntax.
Both Thompson&apos;s and the present study are
primarily concerned with extending the

<bodyText confidence="0.999884785714286">
habitability of current systems by identifying
phenomena that people use but which would be
problematic for machines. However, our two
studies proceeded along different lines.
Thompson&apos;s was more concerned with utterance forms
and less with pragmatic function, whereas for this
study, the concerns are reversed in priority. Our
priority stems from the observation that
differences in utterance function will influence
the processing of the same utterance form.
However, the present findings cannot be said to
contradict Thompson&apos;s (nor vice-versa). Each
corpus could perhaps be used to verify the
findings in the other.

V. CCNCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99950565625">
Spoken and teletype discourse, even used for
the same ends, differ in structure and in form.
Telephone conversation about object assembly is
dominated by explicit requests to find objects
satisfying descriptions. However, these requests
are never performed directly. Techniques for
interpreting &amp;quot;indirect speech acts&amp;quot; thus may
become crucial for speech understanding systems.
These findings must be interpreted with two
cautionary notes. First, the
request-for-identification category is specific to
discourse situations in which the topics of
conversation include objects Physically present to
the hearer. Though the same surface forms might
be used, if the conversation is not about
manipulating concrete objects, different pragmatic
inferences could be made.
Secondly, the indirection results may occur
only in conversations between humans. It is
possible that people do not wish to verbally
instruct others with fine-grained imperatives for
fear of sounding condescending. Print may remove
such inhibitions, as may talking to a machine.
This is a question that cannot be settled until
good speech understanding systems have been
developed. We conjecture that the better the
system, the more likely it will be to receive
fine-grained indirect requests. It appears to us
preferable to err on the side of accepting
people&apos;s natural forms of speech than to force the
user to think about the phrasing of utterances, at
the expense of concentrating on the problem.

Case 2 is handled by an inference saying that if a speaker communicates that an act will yield some desired effect, then one can infer the speaker wants that act performed to achieve that effect. Case 3 is an example of questioning a desired effect of an act (e.g., &amp;quot;Is the garbage out?&amp;quot;) to convey that the act itself is desired. Case 4 is similar to Case 2, except the relationship between the desired effect and some action yielding that effect is presumed. In all these cases, ACT = LOOK-AT, and EFFECT = &amp;quot;HEARER SEE X&amp;quot;. Since LOOK-AT is part of the &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; (Allen, 1979) of IDENTIFY-REFERENT, Allen&apos;s &amp;quot;body-action&amp;quot; inference will make the necessary connection, by inferring that the speaker wanted the hearer to LOOK-AT something as part of his IDENTIFY-REFERENT act.

The scheme, which was tested and revised on pilot data until reliability was attained, Included a set of approximately 20 &amp;quot;speech act&amp;quot; categories that were used to label intent, and a set of &amp;quot;operators&amp;quot; and propositions that were used to describe the assembly task, as in (Sacerdoti, 1975). The operators and propositions often served as the propositional content of the communicative acts. In addition to the domain actions, pilot data led us to include an action of &amp;quot;physically identifying the referent of a description&amp;quot; as part of the scheme (Cohen, 1981). This action will be seen to be requested explicitly by Telephone experts, but not by experts in Teletype mode. Of course, a coding scheme must not only capture the domain of discourse, it must be tailored to the nature of discourse per se. Many theorists have observed that a speaker can use a number of utterances to achieve a goal, and can use one utterance to achieve a number of goals. Correspondingly, the coders could consider utterances as jointly achieving one intention (by &amp;quot;bracketing&amp;quot; them), could place an utterance in multiple categories, and could attribute more than one intention to</context>

E. Analysis 2: First time identifications Frequency data are important for computational linguistics because they indicate the kinds of utterances a system may have to 30 interpret most often. However, frequency data include mistakes, dialogue repairs, and repetition. Perhaps identification requests occur primarily after referential miscommunication (as occurs for teletype dialogues (Cohen, 1981)). One might then argue that people would speak more carefully to machines and thus would not need to use identification requests frequently. Alternatively, the use of such requests as a step in a Telephone speaker&apos;s plan may truly be a strategy of engaging in spoken . task-related discourse that is not found in TTY discourse. TO explore when identification requests were used, a second analysis of the utterance codings was undertaken that was limited to &amp;quot;first time&amp;quot; identifications. Each time a novice (rightly or wrongly) first identified a piece, the communicative act that caused him/her to d</context>

NO speaker used the paradigmatic direct forms, e.g. &amp;quot;Find the rubber ring shaped like an 0&amp;quot;, which occurred frequently in the written modality. However, the use of indirection is selective -- Telephone experts frequently use direct imperatives to perform assembly requests. Only the identification-request seems to be affected by modality. III. INTERPRETING INDIRECT REQUESTS FOR REFERENT IDENTIFICATION Many of the utterance forms can be analyzed as requests for identification once-an act for physically searching for the referent of a description has been posited (Cohen, 1981). Assume that the action IDENTIFY-REF (AGT, DESCRIPTION) has as precondition &amp;quot;there exists an object 0 perceptually accessible to agt such that 0 is the (semantic) reference of DESCRIPTION.&amp;quot; The result of the action might be labelled by (IDENTIFIED-REF ?GT DESCRIPTION). Finally, the means for performing the act will be some procedural combination of sensory actions (e.g., looking) and counting. The exact combination will depend on the description used. The utterances in Group A can then be analyzed as requests for IDENTIFY-REFERENT using Perrault and Allen&apos;s (1980) method of applying plan reco</context>

It is also suggested that the presence of sequential constructions is tied to the possibilities for preplanning an utterance, and hence oral and written discourse would differ in this way. Our study upholds this claim for Telephone vs. Teletype, but does not do so for our Written condition in which many requests for identification occur as separate steps. Furthermore, Ochs et al.&apos;s claim does not account for the use of identification requests in Teletype modality after prior referential miscommunication (Cohen, 1981). Thus, it would seem that sequential constructions can result from (what they term) planned as well as unplanned discourse. It is difficult to compare our results with those of other studies. Chapanis et al.&apos;s observation that voice modes are faster and wordier than teletype modes certainly holds here. However, their transcripts cannot easily be used to verify our findings since, for the equipment assembly problem, their subjects were given a set of instructions that could be, and often were, read to the listener. Thus, utterance function would often be predetermined. Our subjects had to reme</context>

Thus, utterance forms are not compared directly across modes; only utterances used to achieve the same goals are compared, and it is those goals that are expected to vary across modes. With form and function identified, one can then proceed to discuss how utterance processing may differ from one mode to another. Our plan-based theory of speech acts will be used to explain how an utterance&apos;s intent coding can be derived from the utterance&apos;s form and the prior interaction. A computational model of intent recognition in dialogue (Allen, 1979; Cohen, 1979; Sidner et al., 1981) can then be used to mimic the theory&apos;s assignment of intent.
