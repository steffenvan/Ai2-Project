Is MT LINGUISTICS?
</author>
<bodyText confidence="0.99888150925926">
Reading Jonathan Slocum&apos;s survey article of machine
translation in Computational Linguistics, Volume 11,
No. 1, some points struck me. Slocum&apos;s paper aims to be
an overview of the state of the art in MT. As such it is
good work. But some methodological points of view
could have been considered more accurately; for exam-
ple, the relation of MT and the computational linguistic
paradigm to linguistics (seen as a study of the nature of
human language), and the notion &amp;quot;fully automatic high
quality translation&amp;quot;.
It was a stunning surprise to learn that translation as a
profession and discipline is so underweighted in the
U.S.A. This, coupled with the state of linguistic theory
and the computational devices at hand, surely explains
almost in itself the failure of early attempts made in
machine translation in the 1950s and 1960s in the U.S.A.
If one&apos;s premises are bad, one&apos;s methods will not be any
better and results still worse. And this really seems to be
the situation in the history of MT (cf. Zarachnak 1979).
The second point I want to address is Slocum&apos;s argu-
mentation in favour of level of automaticity and quality
of current MT systems. As Slocum puts it, it goes some-
thing like this: human translation is a many-step process,
where it is not unusual for products to revised many
times. Thus far we agree. Everyone with some experi-
ence in translation knows this. And this is no wonder,
considering that linguistic competence is open, without
definite limits. One never &amp;quot;learns&amp;quot; language totally,
competence is never &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; whether we speak about
mother tongue or some foreign language (cf. Sampson
1980, 1983). But Slocum takes this step-by-step revision
style of human translation to mean — at least it seems so
to me — that we actually already have fully automatic
high quality MT systems in some sense. Following is a
crucial passage in Slocum&apos;s argumentation (p. 2)
It is easy to see, therefore, that the &amp;quot;fully-automatic high-
quality machine translation&amp;quot; standard, imagined by most
U.S. scholars to constitute minimum acceptability, must
be radically redefined. Indeed, the most famous MT critic
of all eventually recanted his strong opposition to MT,
admitting that these terms could only be defined by the
users, according to their own standards, for each situation
(Bar-Hillel 1971). So an MT system does not have to
print and bind the result of its translation in order to
qualify as &amp;quot;fully automatic&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;High quality&amp;quot; does not at
all rule out post-editing, since the proscription of human
revision would &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; the infeasibility of high-quality
Human Translation. Academic debates about what
constitutes &amp;quot;high-quality&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fully-automatic&amp;quot; are
considered irrelevant by the users of Machine Translation
(MT) and Machine-aided Translation (MAT) systems;
what matters to them are two things: whether the systems
can produce output of sufficient quality for the intended
use (e.g., revision), and whether the operation as a whole
is cost-effective or, rarely, justifiable on other grounds,
like speed.
It seems that Slocum&apos;s argumentation is not sound
here; it blurs too many arguments together. Some of the
arguments concern linguistic methodology — for example,
human translation is of a certain nature and thus machine
translation has the right to be that way as well. Other
arguments are pure pragmatic — for example, the only
thing that counts to users is the cost-effectiveness of the
operation; an MT system does not have to print and
binds its results.
But what should matter most is, of course, linguistic
argumentation. If MT wants to be a proper linguistic
discipline, it should pay more attention to its linguistic
premises. Especially, it should pay more attention to the
idea of linguistic openness and to the idea of rationality
behind language (cf. Sampson 1983, Itkonen 1983). If
rationality, or rational behaviour, is the very essence of
language behaviour, this surely will limit the term &amp;quot;high-
quality&amp;quot; to something other than somebody&apos;s &amp;quot;own
standards&amp;quot;. This is one point. The other point is, the
notion of linguistic rationality may have two sides: nomic
(i.e., deterministic laws) and non-nomic (undeterministic
laws). This very idea, if true, puts certain limits on MT.
According to this thesis, language has open ends, because
of its creative nature, and all of it cannot be easily — if at
all — described with deterministic methods, i.e., using
computers and algorithms.
The ideal notion of fully automatic high quality trans-
lation (FAHQT) is still lurking behind the machine trans-
lation paradigm: it is something that MT projects want to
reach. [They can try to reach it only asymptotically, of
course, but nevertheless they aim at it.] Once again
pragmatics has come into play: human intervention in
MT, as post-editing or whatever, is the thing that slows
down the process. MT systems can be made to translate
faster and faster, but the usefulness of these systems is
limited to the capacity of the human support team if
much post-editing is needed.
So, to be cost-effective, an MT system has to produce
output that is good enough to need little or no human
post-editing. To produce &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; output, an MT
system has to be based on linguistically sound principles,
at least in the long run. To get the linguistically sound
ideas, we have to study language more intensively. We
are left with linguistics, once again, as it should be. If we
are doing something we understand weakly, we cannot
hope for good results. And language, including trans-
lation, is still rather weakly understood. Therefore, I
think it is rather deceptive to give an impression that
currently existing MT programs resemble closely, or even
are equal to, FAHQT. They seem to work astonishingly
well as, for example, test runs of METAL show (cf.
Slocum et al. 1985). But if MT wishes to be a part of the

computational linguistics paradigm, it should pay more
attention to its linguistic premises. Working programs
are an end in themselves, but if they are not based on
linguistically sound principles, the results may not have
much to say to computational linguistics or to linguistics
proper. It seems the most attention is paid to results in
the MT complex, but we may not know what we are talk-
ing about if the premises of MT are omitted from the
discussions.
