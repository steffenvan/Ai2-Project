ABSTRACT SPEECH
We describe a dialogue-handling module used as RECOGNI ZER
an interface between a vocal terminal and a task-
oriented device (for instance : a robot manipula-
ting blocks). This module has been specially desi-
gned to be implanted on a single board using micro-
processor, and inserted into the vocal terminal
which already comprises a speech recognition board
and a synthesis board. The entire vocal system is
at present capable of conducting a real time spo-
ken dialogue with its user.

boards (Lignard and Mariani, 1982 ; Gauvain, 1983 ;
Asta and Lignard, 1979) ; in our laboratory, such
modules have been integrated into a compact unit
that forms an autonomous vocal processor which has
applications in a number of varied domains : vocal
command of cars, of planes, office automation and
computer-aided learning (Mel et al., 1982).
Whereas most of the present language under-
standing systems require large computational re-
sources, our goal has been to implement a dialog-
handling board in the LIMSI&apos;s Vocal Terminal.
The use of micro-systems introduces memory si-
ze and real-time constraints which have incited us
to limit ourselves in the use of presently availa-
ble computational linguistic techniques. Therefore,
we have taken inspiration from a simple model of
semantic network ; for the same reasons, the ini-
tial parser based on an Augmented Transition Net-
work (Woods, 1970) and implemented on an IBM 370
(Memmi and Mariani, 1982) was replaced by another
less time- and memory-consuming one.
The work presented herein extends possible
application fields by allowing an interactive vocal
relation between the machine and its user for the
execution of a specific task : the application that
we have chosen is a man-machine communication with
a robot manipulating blocks and using a Plan Gene-
rating System.

Once the acoustic processing of the speech si-
gnal is performed by the 250 word-based recognition
board, syntactic analysis is carried out.
It may be noted that response time and word
confusions increase with the vocabulary size of
word recognition systems. To limit the degradation
of performance, syntactic information is used :
words that can possibly follow a given word may be
predicted at each step of the recognition process
with the intention of reducing vocabulary.

In order to build a representation of the deep
structure of an input sentence, parameters reque-
sted by the semantic procedures must be filled with
the correct values. The parsing method that we de-
velopped considers the naturel language utterances
as a set of noun phrases connected with function
words (prepositions, verbs ...) which specify their
relationships. At the present time, the set of noun
phrases is obtained by segmenting the utterance at
each function word.

III SEMANTIC PROCESSING
A. System knowledge data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908375">
The computational semantic memory is inspired
by the Collins and Quillian model, a hierarchical
network in which each node represents a concept.
Properties can be assigned to each node, which al-
so inherits those of its ancestors. Our choice has
been influenced by the desire to design a system
which would be able to easily learn new concepts ;
that is, to complete or to modify its knowledge
according to information coming from a vocal input/
output system.
Each noun of the vocabulary is represented by
a node in such a tree structure. The meaning of any
given verb is provided by rules that indicate the
type of objects that can be related. As far as ad-
jectives are concerned, they are arranged in exclu-
sive property groups.

<bodyText confidence="0.955336038461538">
The knowledge-based data (which may be enlar-
ged by information provided by the vocal channel)
is complemented by temporary data which chronologi-
cally contain, in abbreviated form, events evoked
during the dialogue.
B. Assertion processing
The small amount of data representing a given
universe allows us to approach the computational
treatment of these two complementary and contrary
components of dialogue: learning and contestation.
Every time an assertion is proposed by the
user a procedure parses its semantic validity by
answering the question &amp;quot;Does this sentence fit with
the current state of the knowledge data ?&amp;quot;. If a
contradiction is detected, it is pointed out to the
user who must justify his proposal. If the user
persists in his declaration, the machine may then
modify its universe knowledge, otherwise the utte-
rance is not taken into account.
When no contradiction is encountered, the pro-
gram enters into a learning process adding to the
temporary data or knowledge-based data.

I. Teaching utterances
These assertions, characterized by the pre-
sence of a non-action verb, permit both the com-
plete construction of the semantic network and of
the concept relation rules specifying the possible
entities that can serve as arguments for a predi-
cate.
Although most of our knowledge results from
long nurturing and frequent interactions with the
outside world, it is possible to give an approxi-
mate meaning to concrete objects and verbs by
using an elementary syntax. A new concept may be
taught by filling in its position within the se-
mantic network and possibly associating it with
properties that will differenciate it from its
brother nodes. Concept relation rules can be learn-
ed, too.

2. Descriptive utterances
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99953980952381">
Sentences involving an action verb are trans-
lated into an unambiguous representation which con-
denses and organizes information into the very same
form as that of the concept relation rules from
knowledge data. Therefore, semantic validity can be
easily tested by a pattern-matching process. A se-
mantic event reduced to a nested-triplet structure
and considered as valid is then inserted in the
dynamic-events memory, and can be requested later
on by the question-answering process.
Although the language is limited to a small
subset of natural French, several equivalent syn-
tactic structures are allowed to express a given
event ; in order to avoid storing multiple repre-
sentations of the same event, paraphrases of a given
utterance are reduced to a single standard form.
One of the task effected by a language under-
standing system consists of recognizing the concepts
that are evoked inside the input utterances. As
soon as ambiguities are detected, they are resolved
through interaction with the user.

C. Question processing
In everyday language, intonation often conti-
tutes the marker that discriminates between ques-
tions and assertions. Since prosody information is
not presently taken into account by the word recog-
nition system, the presence of an interrogative
pronoun switches on the information research pro-
cessing in permanent knowledge-data or in dynamic-
events memory.

The abbreviated semantic events list is close-
ly examined, from recent to older data, until the
question-pattern approximately matches one of the
memorized events. Possible analogy between a memo-
rized event and one evoked by the question is then
analysed. Coincidences rarely happen, so the system
must be able to ask for full specifications about
the event that interests the user ; at that time
there is a vocal discussion aimed at leading the
system to that event in a step-wise manner.

<bodyText confidence="0.962897727272727">
D. Processing a user&apos;s incomplete utterance
An important specific quality of the semantic
process is that it is able to accomodate bad acous-
tical recognition through intelligent interactive
feedback.
So, when one part of a given sentence has not
been recognized, because of mispronunciation or
background noise, the system produces a suitable
question bringing the user to repeat the unrecogni-
zed word within his answer.
Two cases can occur :
if the word is again unrecognized, the system
assumes that the entity is not in the prescribed
vocabulary (containing the acoustic features of
the words). An explanatory message is then produced
through the synthesis module.
if the lexical entity is well recognized this
time, it is added to the previous utterance and
computed in the same manner as the others.

S : Que fais-tu avec le livre ?
(What are you doing with the book)

At present we apply ourselves to make the
dialog-handling module easily adaptable to various
domains of application.
When a certain amount of acoustical components
in a sentence have not been recognized, the system
asks for the user to repeat his assertion.

E. Sentence production
I. Translation of a deep structure into an
output sentence
This process consists of inserting semantic
entities into the suitable syntactic diagram which
depends on the computational procedure that is ac-
tivated (question answering, contradiction, learn-
ing, asking for specifications ...). Since each
syntactic variation of a word corresponds to a sin-
gle semantic representation, sentence generation
makes use of verb conjugation procedures and con-
cordance procedures.
In order to improve the natural quality of
speech, different types of sentences expressing one
same idea may be generated in a pseudo-random man-
ner. The same question asked to the system several
times can thus induce different formulated respon-
ses.
2. Text-to-speech transcription ambiguities
A module of the synthesis process takes any
French text and determines the elements necessary
for the diphone synthesis, with the help of a dic-
tionnary containing pronunciation rules and their
exceptions (Prouts, 1979). However, some ambigui-
ties concerning text-to-speech transcription can
still remain and cannot be resolved without syn-
tactico-semantic information ; for instance :
&amp;quot;Les poules du couvent couvent&amp;quot; (the convent hens
are sitting on their eggs) is pronounced by the
synthesizer: /lepuldykuv3kuvg/
(the convent hens &apos;convent).
To deal with that problem, we may send the
synthesizer the phonetic form of the words.

IV CONCLUSION

<bodyText confidence="0.999980076923077">
The dialog experiment is presently running on
a PDP 11/23 MINC and on an INTEL development system
with a VLISP interpreter in real-time and using a
series interface with the vocal terminal.
The isolated word recognition board we are
using for the moment makes the user pause for appro-
ximately half a second between each word he pronoun-
ces. In the near future we plan to replace this
module by a connected word system which will make
the dialog more natural. It may be noted that the
compactness of the understanding program allows its
implantation on a microprocessor board which is to
be inserted in the vocal terminal.
