Let’s start off by setting the scene for this book. A term is generally regarded as vague if
it admits borderline cases, that is, cases where speakers are reluctant to say either that
the term definitely applies or definitely does not apply. An example is the expression
bright, say applied to lights. Although some lights are definitely bright, and others are
definitely dim, there are in-between cases which seem to be neither bright nor dim.
Borderline vagueness is often associated with the notion of tolerance, in the sense that
small changes in objects don’t affect the applicability of a vague term. Thus, suppose
my sitting room light is definitely bright and I turn down the dimmer a very tiny
fraction; then the light will still be regarded as bright. This principle of tolerance gives
rise to a puzzling situation: If I keep on turning down the dimmer, small step by small
step, the diminution in brightness will be imperceptible at each step. Thus, if the light
is bright at step n, then tolerance dictates that it will also be bright at step n + 1. Yet
inevitably at some stage in this process the light will no longer be bright—indeed,
it might be entirely extinguished. Situations like this are often discussed under the
heading of the sorites paradox.
Kees van Deemter has contributed several insightful papers to the literature on
vagueness, and he would have been well placed to write a technical monograph on the
subject. Instead, he has taken the brave step of producing a book for the general public,
following in the ‘popular science’ footsteps of such luminaries as Richard Dawkins. In
general, he has succeeded admirably. I’m not sure whether I would recommend giving
this book to your grandmother, but van Deemter’s informal style, vivid examples, and
lucid exposition make it a pleasure to read.
A number of themes recur throughout the book: How does vagueness function
in communication and why is it so prevalent? Are there situations in which vague
terms are preferable to precise ones? And what is the relation between vagueness and
context-dependence? Framed by an introduction and epilogue, the twelve chapters
of the book that explore these themes are divided into three parts. Part I makes a
case for the pervasiveness of vagueness, even “where one least expects it,” such as in
scientific measurement. Chapter 2 contains an interesting excursus on how apparently
clearcut notions such as ‘species’ become more indeterminate on closer inspection, and
Chapter 3 points out that attempts to turn vague terms such as obesity, poverty, and
intelligence into precisely defined notions suitable for scientific investigation are subject
to arbitrariness and residual vagueness. Examples of gradual change in the identity
of individuals are addressed in Chapter 4, and issues of numerical approximation,
rounding, round numbers, and levels of statistical significance appear in Chapter 5.
Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 1
Part II surveys the main theoretical approaches to vagueness in linguistics, philos-
ophy, and logic. The linguistic frameworks—and approaches to vagueness—discussed
in Chapter 6 are likely to be familiar to readers of this journal. (One small surprise is the
omission of Lakoff [1973] from the discussion of hedges and also from the presentation
of fuzzy logic later in the book.) Probably more interesting to most readers is Chapter 7,
devoted to “Reasoning with vague information.” The chapter starts with a presentation
of three principles of reasoning with vague concepts. Admissibility is concerned with
respecting rank ordering along a dimension, as in this example: If x is tall, and y is
taller than x, then y too is tall. According to the second principle, the relation — of
indistinguishability (with respect to some vague property) is non-transitive: if x — y
and y — z, it need not hold that x — z. Van Deemter motivates this principle with the
example of a weighing balance. Given friction between the moving parts, the balance
will have limited sensitivity, so that for some y that is fractionally heavier than x, the
difference in weight will fail to register, and similarly for a z that is fractionally heavier
than y. However, it may well be that there is sufficient difference between x and z for
the balance to distinguish between the weight of the two. The third principle, tolerance,
is similar to the notion mentioned in the first paragraph of this review, though couched
in slightly different terms. Van Deemter uses these principles to present the sorites
paradox, and then proceeds to review and critique the so-called epistemic solution,
taking experimental results on color perception as one of the crucial sources of counter-
evidence. Consideration of the sorites paradox continues into Chapters 8 and 9. Among
the approaches considered are supervaluations, context-dependence, and fuzzy logic.
Van Deemter finds the last of these sufficiently compelling that he devotes some time
to pointing out its flaws. Fuzzy logic, he suggests, belongs to the class of degree theories,
which he favors as the most promising overall approach to the semantics of vagueness.
It is worth noting that his nomenclature is potentially confusing: Whereas linguists
would expect a degree-theoretic approach to vagueness to involve quantification over
degrees (e.g., the degree to which John is tall) in a classical logic, van Deemter is thinking
here in terms of degrees of truth. From fuzzy logic, he segues into a brief but intriguing
exploration of probabilistic logic, drawing particularly on little-known work by Max
Black (1937).
Part III carries the story forward into artificial intelligence and computational lin-
guistics. Artificial intelligence is exemplified by decision support systems using fuzzy
logic. This is a point in the book where I would have liked to see mention of a topic
that is missing, namely the pervasiveness of vagueness in geographical information
systems (see, e.g., Bennett, Mallenby, and Third [2008] and references therein). Next,
van Deemter turns to the challenge of getting a natural language generation (NLG)
system to use vague terms appropriately, focusing on gradable adjectives in definite
descriptions. One of the novel contributions at this point is to couch the NLG system’s
choices in terms of game theory. Although this direction of inquiry seems extremely
promising, I am not persuaded that the account of vagueness in strategic communica-
tion developed by Aragones and Neeman (2000) deserves the amount of space that it
receives here. By contrast, van Deemter presents a valuable and detailed response to
Lipman’s (2006) argument that in a cooperative game, using vague terms can never be
optimal. In considering a range of potential counter-arguments, van Deemter creates
an opportunity to restate and review many of the themes running through the book.
Although no conclusive answers are given, I certainly had a sense that this closing
discussion tied together much of the earlier material as well as indicating promising
new research directions.

In conclusion, although van Deemter goes to considerable pains to present the
work of others in an even-handed manner, he has his own views on the right way to
model vagueness and is not afraid to express them. The range of material covered is
impressive. Even if you are well-versed in the literature on vagueness, you are likely
to learn something new. And if you’ve never really thought about vagueness, this is a
great starting point. In fact, the book would serve as an excellent jumping off point for
a graduate seminar. Finally, I’d like to endorse a remark found in the Preface:
It has been a delight to discover how much complex material can be reduced to simple ideas. On a
good day, it even seems to me that some themes are best explored in this informal way, free from
the constraints of an academic straitjacket.
