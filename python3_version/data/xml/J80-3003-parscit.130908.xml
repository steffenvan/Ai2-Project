We propose an account of indirect forms of speech acts to request and inform based
on the hypothesis that language users can recognize actions being performed by others,
infer goals being sought, and cooperate in their achievement. This cooperative behaviour is
independently motivated and may or may not be intended by speakers. If the hearer
believes it is intended, he or she can recognize the speech act as indirect; otherwise it is
interpreted directly. Heuristics are suggested to decide among the interpretations.

Austin [1962] was one of the first to stress the
distinction between the action(s) which a speaker per-
forms by uttering a sentence (such as informing, re-
questing, or convincing) and the truth conditions of
propositions contained in the sentence. Actions have
effects on the world, and may have preconditions
which must obtain for them to be felicitously per-
formed. For actions whose execution involves the use
of language (or speech acts), the preconditions may
include the speaker holding certain beliefs about the
world, and having certain intentions or wants as to
how it should change.
As well as being important to the study of natural
language semantics, speech acts are important to the
designer of conversational natural language under-
standing systems. Such systems should be able to
recognize what actions the user is performing. Con-
versely, if such a system is to acquire information or
request assistance from its user, it should know how
and when to ask questions and make requests. (See
Bruce [1975] for an early attempt.)
Cohen and Perrault [1979] (hereafter referred to as
CP) argue for the distinction between a competence

theory of speech acts, which characterizes what utter-
ances an ideal speaker can make in performing what
speech acts, and a performance theory which also ac-
counts for how a particular utterance is chosen in giv-
en circumstances, or how it is recognized. We are
only concerned here with a competence theory.
In Perrault, Allen, and Cohen [1978] we suggested
that it is useful to consider speech acts in the context
of a planning system. A planning system consists of a
class of •parameterized procedures called operators,
whose execution can modify the world. Each operator
is labelled with formulas stating its preconditions and
effects. A plan construction algorithm is a procedure
which, given a description of some initial state of the
world and a goal state to be achieved, constructs a
plan, or sequence of operators, to achieve it.
It is assumed there, and in all our subsequent work,
that language users maintain a model of the world
(their beliefs) and a set of goals (their wants). One
person S&apos;s beliefs may include beliefs about another
person A&apos;s beliefs and wants, including A&apos;s beliefs
about S, etc. We do not concern ourselves with obli-
gations, feelings, etc., which clearly can also be affect-
ed by speech acts.
CP discuss criteria for judging the correctness of
the preconditions and effects of the operators corre-
sponding to speech acts, and specifically those of the
acts INFORM and REQUEST. However, the condi-
tions on INFORM and REQUEST given in CP are at
best necessary and certainly not sufficient. In particu-

lar they say nothing about the form of utterances used
to perform the speech acts. Several syntactic devices
can be used to indicate the speech act being per-
formed: the most obvious are explicit performative
verbs such as &amp;quot;I hereby request you to ...&amp;quot;, and mood
(indicative for assertions, imperative for requests to
do, interrogative for requests to inform). But the
mood of an utterance is well known to not completely
specify its illocutionary force: 1.a-b can be requests to
close the door, 1.c-e can be requests to tell the an-
swer, and 1.f can be an assertion.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994459166666667">
(1.a) I want you to close the door.
(1.b) Will you close the door?
(1.c) Tell me the answer.

(1.e) Do you know what the answer is?
(1.f) Do you know that Jack is in town?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9228555">
Furthermore, all these utterances can also be intended
literally in some contexts. For example, a parent leav-

yes/no answer as a confirmation.

The object of this paper is to extend the work in
CP to account for indirect use of mood, loosely called
indirect speech acts. The solution proposed here is
based on the following intuitively simple and inde-
pendently motivated hypotheses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993206">
(1) Language users are rational agents engaged in
goal seeking behaviour. Among these goals
are the modification of the beliefs and goals
of other agents.
(2) Rational agents are frequently capable of
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995473666666667">
identifying actions being performed by others
and goals being sought. An essential part of
helpful or cooperative behaviour is the adop-
tion by one agent of a goal of another, fol-
lowed by an attempt to achieve it. For exam-
ple, for a store clerk to reply &amp;quot;How many do
you want?&amp;quot; to a customer who has asked
&amp;quot;Where are the steaks?&amp;quot;, the clerk must have
inferred that the customer wants steaks, then
he must have decided to get them himself.
This might have occurred even if the customer
had intended to get the steaks him or herself.
Cooperative behaviour must be accounted for
independently of speech acts, for it often oc-
curs without the use of language.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.923620375">
(3) In order for a speaker to successfully perform
a speech act, he must intend that the hearer
recognize his intention to achieve the effects
of the speech act, and must believe it is likely
that the hearer will be able to do so. This is
the foundation for the philosophical account
of speech acts.
(4) Language users know that others are capable
of achieving goals, of recognizing actions, and
of cooperative behaviour. Furthermore, they
know that others know they know, etc. A
speaker may intend not only that his actions
be recognized but also that his goals be infer-
red.
(5) Thus a speaker can perform one speech act A
by performing another speech act B if he in-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986167652173913">
tends that the hearer recognize not only that
B was performed but also that through coop-
erative behaviour by the hearer, intended by
the speaker, the effects of A should be
achieved. The speaker must also believe that
it is likely that the hearer can recognize this
intention.
The process by which one agent can infer the plans
of another is central to our account of speech acts.
Schmidt et al [1978] and Genesereth [1978] present
algorithms by which one agent can infer the goals of
another, but assuming no interaction between the two.
We describe the process in terms of a set of plausible
plan inference rules directly related to the rules by
which plans can be constructed. Let A and S be two
agents and ACT an action. One example of a simple
plan inference rule is:
&amp;quot;If S believes that A wants to do ACT then
it is plausible that S believes that A wants to
achieve the effects of ACT.&amp;quot;
From simple rules like this can be derived more com-
plex plan inference rules such as:
&amp;quot;If S believes that A wants S to recognize
A&apos;s intention to do ACT, then it is plausible
that S believes that A wants S to recognize
A&apos;s intention to achieve the effects of ACT.&amp;quot;
Notice that the complex rule is obtained by introduc-
ing &amp;quot;S believes A wants&amp;quot; in the antecedent and conse-
quent of the simple rule, and by interpreting &amp;quot;S recog-
nizes A&apos;s intention&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;S comes to believe that A
wants&amp;quot;. Throughout the paper we identify &amp;quot;want&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;intend&amp;quot;.
We show that rules of the second type can account
for S&apos;s recognition of many indirect speech acts by A,
i.e. those in which S recognizes A&apos;s intention that S
perform cooperative acts.
To distinguish the use of, say, the indicative mood,
in an assertion from its use in, say, an indirect request,
the speech act operators REQUEST and INFORM of
CP are reformulated and two further acts S.REQUEST
and S.INFORM are added. These surface level acts
are realized literally as indicative and imperative utter-
ances. An S.REQUEST to INFORM is realized as a
question. The surface level acts can be recognized
immediately as parts of the higher level (or illocution-
ary level) acts, to which the simple plan construction

and inference rules can apply. Alternatively, the com-
plex rules can be applied to the effects of the surface
acts, and the intended performance of one of the illo-
cutionary acts inferred later.
For example, there are two ways an agent S could
be led to tell A the secret after hearing A tell him
&amp;quot;Can you tell me the secret?&amp;quot;. Both start with S&apos;s
recognition that A asked a yes/no question. In the
first case, S assumes that A simply wanted to know
whether S could tell the secret, then infers that A in
fact wants to know the secret and, helpfully, decides
to tell it. In the second case S recognizes that A
intends S to infer that A wants to know the secret and
that A intends S to tell A the secret, and thus that A
has requested S to tell the secret.

In general, several of the plan inference rules could
apply at any time, and none of them guarantees a valid
consequence. The application of the rules is con-
trolled by a set of heuristics which rate the plausibility
of the outcomes.

Following a review of the relevant aspects of
speech act theory in section 2, section 3 outlines our
assumptions about beliefs, goals, actions, plans, and
the plan inference process. Section 4 shows how the
speech act definitions and the plan inference process
can be used to relate literal to indirect meanings for
REQUESTs and INFORMs. We show how utterances
such as 1.h-1, and even 1.m can be used as requests to
pass the salt, and what the origin of the several inter-
pretations of 1.m is.

Similarly we show how 1.n can be used to inform

The speech act recognition process described here
has been implemented as a computer program and
tested by having it simulate an information clerk at a
railway station. This domain is real, but sufficiently
circumscribed so that interchanges between clerk and
patrons are relatively short and are directed towards a
limited set of goals. The program accepts as input
simple English sentences, parses them using an ATN
parser, and produces as output the speech act(s) it
recognized and their associated propositional contents.
It can handle all the examples discussed here. Details
of the implementation can be found in Allen [1979].

2.1. Basic Definitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.946477636363636">
Prior to Austin [1962], logicians considered the
meaning of a sentence to be determined only by its
truth value. However, Austin noted that some sen-
tences cannot be classified as true or false; the utter-
ance of one of these sentences constitutes the per-
formance of an action, and hence he named them
performatives. To quote Austin: &amp;quot;When I say, before
the register or altar, etc., &apos;I do&apos;, I am not reporting on
a marriage: I am indulging in it&amp;quot;.
Examples like this, and his inability to rigorously
distinguish performative sentences from those which
purportedly have truth value (which he called
constatives) led Austin to the view that all utterances
could be described as actions, or speech acts. He clas-
sified speech acts into three classes, the locutionary,
illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts.
A locutionary act is an act of saying something: it
is the act of uttering sequences of words drawn from
the vocabulary of a given language and conforming to
its grammar.
An illocutionary act is one performed in making an
utterance; &amp;quot;promise&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;warn&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;inform&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;request&amp;quot;
are names of illocutionary acts. In general, any verb
that can complete the sentence &amp;quot;I hereby &lt;verb&gt; you
{that I to] ...&amp;quot; names an illocutionary act. An utter-
ance has illocutionary force F if the speaker intends to
perform the illocutionary act F by making that utter-
ance. Verbs that name types of illocutionary acts are
called performative verbs. From now on, we take
speech acts to mean the illocutionary acts.
Perlocutionary acts are performed by making the
utterance. For example, S may scare A by warning A,
or convince A of something by informing A of it. The
success of a perlocutionary act is typically beyond the
control of the speaker. For example, S cannot con-
vince A of something against A&apos;s will, S can only pres-
ent A with sufficient evidence so that A will decide to
believe it. Perlocutionary acts may or may not be
intentional. For instance, S may or may not intend to
scare A by warning A.
Searle [1969] suggests that illocutionary acts can be
defined by providing, for each act, necessary and suf-
ficient conditions for the successful performance of
the act. Certain syntactic and semantic devices, such
as mood and explicit performative verbs, are used to
indicate illocutionary force.
One of the conditions included in Searle&apos;s account
is that the speaker performs an illocutionary act only if
he intends that the hearer recognize his intention to
perform the act, and thereby recognize the illocution-
ary force. This is important for it links Austin&apos;s work

2.2. Communication and the Recognition of Intention
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994666454545455">
Many philosophers have noted the relationship
between communication (or speaker meaning) and the
recognition of intention (Grice [1957, 1968], Strawson
[1964], Searle [1969], Schiffer [1972].) Grice presents
informally his notion of a speaker meaning something
as follows:
&amp;quot;S meant something by x&apos; is (roughly)
equivalent to &apos;S intended the utterance of x
to produce some effect in an audience by
means of the recognition of this intention&apos;
In other words, in order for S to communicate M
by uttering x to A, S must get A to recognize that S
intended to communicate M by uttering x. To use and
example of Grice&apos;s, if I throw a coin out the window
expecting a greedy person in my presence to run out
and pick it up, I am not necessarily communicating to
him that I want him to leave. For me to have success-
fully communicated, he must at least have recognized
that I intended him to leave. The same arguments
hold when discussing illocutionary acts. For example,
the only way S can request A to do ACT is to get A
to recognize S&apos;s intention to request A to do ACT.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998147">
2.3. The Indirect Speech Act Problem
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988158481481481">
The relation between speech acts and the devices
used to indicate them is complicated by the fact that
performative verbs are seldom present and the same
device can be used to perform many illocutionary acts.
The interrogative mood, for example, can be used to
request: &amp;quot;Can you pass the salt?&amp;quot;
question: &amp;quot;Do you know the time?&amp;quot;
inform: &amp;quot;Do you know that Sam got married?&amp;quot;
warn: &amp;quot;Did you see the bear behind you?&amp;quot;
promise: &amp;quot;Would I miss your party?&amp;quot;
As many authors have pointed out, an utterance
conveys its indirect illocutionary force by virtue of its
literal one (Searle [1975], Morgan [1977], Morgan
[1978]). &amp;quot;It&apos;s cold here&amp;quot; can function as a request to,
say, close the window, in part because it&apos;s an assertion
that the temperature is low.
Most of the literature on the treatment of indirect
speech acts within the theory of grammar stems from
the work of Gordon and Lakoff [1975] (hereafter
GL). They claim that direct and indirect instances of
the same speech act have different &amp;quot;meanings&amp;quot;, i.e.
different logical forms, and they propose a set of
&amp;quot;conversational postulates&amp;quot; by which literal forms
&amp;quot;entail&amp;quot; indirect ones. The postulates for requests
correspond to conditions that must obtain for a re-
quest to be sincere. For A to sincerely request B to
do ACT, the following sincerity conditions must hold:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9983072">
(1) A wants ACT.
(2) B can do ACT.
(3) B is willing to do ACT.
(4) B will not do ACT in the absence
of the request.
</listItem>
<tableCaption confidence="0.628318555555556">
They then propose that one can convey a request
by asserting a speaker-based sincerity condition
(condition 1), or querying a hearer-based sincerity
condition (conditions 2-4).
The postulates for indirect requests given in GL do
not account for the readings of 2.3a and 2.3b as re-
quests, and although more rules could be added (and
some should be weakened) we believe this solution to
be misguided.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.934970733333333">
(2.3a) Is the salt near you?
(2.3b) John asked me to ask you to pass the salt.
GL&apos;s postulates directly relate the literal form of
one speech act to the indirect form of another. Thus
they do not predict why certain acts allow certain indi-
rect forms. For example, the postulates do not ac-
count for why 2.3c-d can be requests while 2.3e-f
cannot. But 2.3e is infelicitous as a (literal) question
since there is no context where one can acquire infor-
mation by querying one&apos;s own mental state. Utterance
2.3f is a reasonable question but even if the speaker
found out the answer, it would not get him any closer
to acquiring the salt (by having the hearer pass it). A
theory of indirect speech acts should capture these
facts; GL&apos;s does not (although they agree it should).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.70372575">
(2.3c) I want the salt.
(2.3d) Do you want to pass the salt?
(2.3e) Do I want the salt?
(2.3f) Does he want to pass the salt?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9393792">
Similarly, GL&apos;s postulates fail to explain the rela-
tion between indirect forms of different speech acts.
For example, 2.3g can be an assertion that P and 2.3h
cannot, for the same reasons that 2.3i can be a request
to do A and 2.3j cannot.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.90646325">
(2.3g) I want you to know that P.
(2.3h) Do I want you to know that P?
(2.3i) I want you to A.
(2.3j) Do I want you to A?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.957444857142857">
The hearer&apos;s knowing that P obtains is an intended
perlocutionary effect of an informing act, just as the
hearer&apos;s doing an act A is an intended effect of a re-
quest. A speaker can indirectly inform or request by
informing the hearer that the speaker desires the per-
locutionary effect of that act, and intending that the
hearer recognize the speaker&apos;s intention that the perlo-
cutionary effect should be achieved.
This paper shows that what GL achieve with their
postulates can be derived from the five hypotheses
given in the Introduction. Our proposal here is a de-

surface form conditions completely from the defini-

mediary level, the surface acts.

GL some problems brought up by Sadock [1970],

Our analysis of indirect REQUESTs and INFORMs
relies on the inference by the hearer of some of the
goals of the speaker and of some of the actions which
the speaker is taking to achieve those goals. Section
3.1 outlines the form of the models of the world which
language users are assumed to have, in particular their
beliefs about the world (and about other agents), and
their goals. In section 3.2 we define actions and how
they affect the belief model. The rules for plan con-
struction and inference are considered in sections 3.3
and 3.4. Because of space limitations, this section is
very sketchy. More detail, motivation, and problems,
are available in Allen [1979] and Allen and Perrault

We assume that every agent S has a set of beliefs
about the world, which may include beliefs about oth-
er agents&apos; beliefs. Agents can hold false beliefs. As
Quine [1956] pointed out, belief creates a context
where substitution of coreferential expressions need
not preserve truth-value.
We add to a first-order language with equality the
operator B, and B(A,P) (usually written BA(P)) is to
be read &amp;quot;A believes that P&amp;quot;, for any formula P. The
B operator is assumed to satisfy the following axiom
schemas (inspired by Hintikka [1962]), where P and Q
are schema variables ranging over propositions, and A
ranges over agents:

The rules of inference are Modus Ponens and:
If T is a theorem, then BA(T) is a
theorem, for every agent A.
i.e. every agent believes every valid consequence of
the logical axioms.
The partial deduction system used in the implemen-
tation of Allen [1979] is based on Cohen [1978]. The
foundations for a more elaborate system can be found
in Moore [1979].

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99345">
3.1.2. Knowing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999550916666667">
The word &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; is used in at least three different
senses in English. One may know that a proposition P
is true, know whether a proposition P is true or know
what the referent of a description is.
We define &amp;quot;A knows that P&amp;quot;, written KNOW(A,P),
as P A BA(P). This is weaker than some definitions of
&amp;quot;know&amp;quot; in the philosophical literature, where, among
other things, &amp;quot;A knows that P&amp;quot; entails that A believes
P for the &amp;quot;right reasons&amp;quot;; i.e. knowledge is true and
justified belief (Ayer [1956], but see also Gettier
[1963]). If S believes that A knows that P, S is com-
mitted to believing that P is true.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.95473775">
Unfortunately, the meaning of &amp;quot;A does not know
that P&amp;quot; is not captured by &amp;quot;(P A BA(P)), but by the
weaker (P A &amp;quot;&apos;BA(P)), i.e.
—KNOW(A,P) P A —BA(P)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993709090909091">
In other words, if S believes A does not know P, then
S must believe that P is true in addition to believing
that A does not believe P is true. This problem is
analogous to the wide/narrow scope distinction that
Russell found in his account of definite descriptions

The most interesting interactions between the belief

the actions of others. This will be further discussed in

3.2. Actions and Plans
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904296296296">
Actions model ways of changing the world. As
with the operators in STRIPS (Fikes and Nilsson
[1971]), the actions can be grouped into families rep-
resented by action schemas, which can be viewed as
parameterized procedure definitions. An action sche-
ma consists of a name, a set of parameters with con-
straints and a set of labelled formulas in the following
classes:
Effects: Conditions that become true after the
execution of the procedure.
Body: a set of partially ordered goal states that
must be achieved in the course of executing the
procedure. In the examples given here, there will
never be more than one goal state in a body.
Preconditions: Conditions necessary to the suc-
cessful execution of the procedure. We distin-
guish for voluntary actions a want precondition:
the agent must want to perform the action, i.e. he
must want the other preconditions to obtain, and
the effects to become true through the achieve-
ment of the body.
The constraints on the parameters consist of type
specifications, and necessary parameter interdependen-
cies. Each action has at least one parameter, namely,
the agent or instigator of the action. In the blocks
world, for example, the action of putting one block on
top of another could be defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8148352">
PUTON(a,b1,b2)
constraints: AGENT(a) A BLOCK(b1) A BLOCK(b2)
precondition: CLEAR(b1) A CLEAR(b2)
A Wa(PUTON(a,b1,b2))
effect: ON(b 1,b2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999409928571429">
The preconditions, effects and body provide infor-
mation to the plan construction and inference process-
es so that they can reason about the applicability and
effect of performing the action in a given context.
Finally, the body of the action specifies what steps
must be achieved in the course of the execution of the
action. Primitive actions have no bodies; their execu-
tion is specified by a non-examinable procedure.
All agents are assumed to believe that actions
achieve their effects and require their preconditions.
We need the following axioms:
For all agents a and b, and for all actions
ACT, if PRE is the precondition of ACT and
EFF its effect then:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8660615">
(ACT.1) BA(ACT(b) + PRE).
(ACT.2) BA(ACT(b) EFF).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996575">
Every predicate and modal operator in these axioms,
and throughout the paper, should be indexed by a
state or time. The resulting logic would be, according-
ly, more complex. The issue is raised again in sect. 6.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998978">
3.3. Plan Construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941418604651">
A plan to transform a world W[0] (represented by
a formula) into a world W[n] is a sequence of actions
Al, ..., An such that the preconditions of Ai are true
in W[i-1], and Ai transforms world W[i-1] into W[i].
An agent can achieve a goal by constructing and
then executing a plan which transforms the current
state of the world into one in which the goal obtains.
This can be done by finding an operator which, if
executed in some world, would achieve the goal. If its
preconditions are satisfied in the initial world, the plan
is complete. Otherwise, the planning process attempts
to achieve the preconditions. This simple view of plan
construction as a &amp;quot;backward chaining&amp;quot; process can be
refined by assuming different levels of &amp;quot;detail&amp;quot; in the
representation of the world and of the operators. This
view (as developed in Sacerdoti [1973, 1975], for
example) allows plans constructed at one level of de-
tail to be expanded to a lower level through the bodies
of their constituent acts.
As noted earlier, the agent of an action must be-
lieve that its precondition is true to believe that his
executing the action will succeed. For agent A to plan
that agent S should perform action ACT, A must
achieve that S should believe that the precondition of
ACT holds, and S&apos;s beliefs should not be inconsistent
with A&apos;s, i.e. it must be true that BA(KNOW(S,P)),
where P is the precondition of ACT.
We assume that an agent cannot do an action with-
out wanting to do that action. Thus a precondition of
every action ACT by an agent A is that
WA(ACT(A)).
We are concerned with the model that agents have
of each other&apos;s plan construction and inference proc-
ess, and consider these two processes as consisting of
chains of plausible inferences operating on goals and
observed actions. The processes are specified in two
parts: first as schemas of rules which conjecture that
certain states or actions can be added to a plan being
constructed. The plausibility of the plans containing
the result of the inferences is then evaluated by rating
heuristics. Thus the plan construction and inference
rules are not to be interpreted as valid logical rules of
inference.

3.4.1. The Plan Inference Process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999571772727273">
The plan inference rules generate formulas which
the recognizing agent believes are possible. A sepa-
rate mechanism is used to evaluate their plausibility.
An agent S attempting to infer the plans of another
agent A starts with an observed action of A and a
(possibly empty) set of goals or expectations which S
believes A may be trying to achieve. S attempts to
construct a plan involving the action and preferably
also including some of the expectations.
Plan inference is a search through a space of partial
plans each consisting of two parts. One part is con-
structed using the plan inference rules from the ob-
served action (and called the alternative); the other is
constructed using the plan construction rules from an
expected goal (and called the expectation).
The partial plans are manipulated by a set of tasks
which decide what rules are to be applied, what
&amp;quot;merges&amp;quot; between alternatives and expectations
should be attempted, and when the process terminates.
The partial plans and their associated tasks are rated
by a set of heuristics, and the most highly rated task is
executed first.

The rating of a partial plan reflects how likely it is
to be part of the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; plan, i.e. the plan the
speaker is executing. If several incompatible inferenc-
es can be made from one point in the alternative, then
its rating is divided among them. The heuristics de-
scribed in this section are based on domain independ-
ent relations between actions, their bodies, precondi-
tions, and effects. The need for more domain depend-
ent measures is discussed later.

3.4.3. Extending the Inference Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962347826087">
A hearer S identifies the illocutionary force of an
utterance by recognizing that the speaker A has cer-
tain intentions, namely that S should recognize some
intention P of A&apos;s. This can be represented by a for-
mula of the form BsWA(BsWA(P)). To do the recog-
nition, the simple plan construction and inference rules
of sections 3.3 and 3.4 must be extended so that they
can operate on these nested formulas. This can be
done by assuming that every agent is aware that other
agents construct and infer plans in the same way he
can. In fact, both the simple inference and construc-
tion rules are necessary to derive the extended infer-
ence rules.
The extended rules are specified by &amp;quot;meta-rules&amp;quot;
which show how to construct new PC/PI rules from
old ones. The first extended construction rule (EC.1)
is: A can achieve that S recognizes that A wants the
effect of ACT by achieving that S recognizes that A
wants ACT to be done, assuming that S would infer
that the effects of ACT are also desired. The same
rule applies if we replace &amp;quot;wants the effect of ACT&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;wants ACT to be done&amp;quot; by any pair of Y and X,

Being able to do an action means that the action&apos;s preconditions are
either presently true, achieved within the existing plan, or can be
achieved by a &amp;quot;relatively simple plan&apos;&apos;, which we take to be a single
action whose preconditions are presently true or achieved in the
existing plan.
4 We have avoided the problem here of planning to do a task
that requires one to deny a subgoal temporarily so that some action
can execute, and then needing to reachieve that (presently true)
goal.

(EC.1) If BsWA(X) =i=&gt; BW(Y) is a PI rule, then
WA(BsWA(Y)) =c=&gt; WA(BsWA(X)) is a PC rule.
Similarly we can generate the corresponding PI rule:
(EI.1) If BsWA(X) =i=&gt; BW(Y) is a PI rule, then
BsWA(BsWA(X)) =i=&gt; BsWA(BsWA(Y)) is a PI
rule.
EI.1 allows prefixing BsWA to plan inference rules.
Plan construction rules can also be embedded: if A
wants S to want to do ACT, then A should be able to
achieve this by achieving that S wants the effect of
ACT, and by relying on S to plan ACT. In other
words:

for S to recognize A&apos;s intention that S want to close
the door by planning for S to recognize A&apos;s intention

The definitions of the speech acts REQUEST and
INFORM used in this paper .are slightly different from
the ones in Cohen and Perrault [1979] in that they
rely on the existence of speech act bodies to account
for indirect forms. Plans including speech acts are
now thought of as having two levels, the illocutionary
level and the surface level. Acts at the illocutionary
level model the intentions motivating an utterance
independently of the syntactic forms used to indicate
those intentions. Acts at the surface level are realized
by utterances having specific illocutionary force indi-
cators.

<bodyText confidence="0.906155805194806">
For A to sincerely inform S that P is true, A must
believe A knows that P is true and want to inform S
that P (the preconditions), and must intend to get S to
know that P is true (the effect), which is done by con-
structing a plan that will achieve S&apos;s recognition of this
intention (i.e. that Bs(WA(KNOW(S,P)))). A then
must depend on S to bring about the efiect: S must
decide to believe what A said. This is made explicit by
introducing an admittedly simplistic DECIDE TO
BELIEVE act:
DECIDE TO BELIEVE(agent, other, P)
prec: B(agent,W(other,KNOW(agent,P)))
effect: KNOW(agent,P)
Thus A can INFORM S of P by achieving
BsWA(KNOW(S,P)) followed by DECIDE TO
BELIEVE(S,A,P).
In many cases, agents reason about INFORM acts
to be performed (by others or by themselves) where
the information for the propositional content is not
known at the time of plan construction. For example,
A may plan for S to inform A whether P is true. A
cannot plan for S to perform INFORM(S,A,P) since
this assumes the truth of P. We get around this diffi-
culty by defining INFORMIF, another view of the
INFORM act.
INFORMIF(speaker, hearer, P)
prec: KNOWIF(speaker,P) A
W(speaker,INFORMIF(speaker,hearer,P))
effect: KNOWIF(hearer,P)
body: B(hearer,W(speaker,KNOWIF(hearer,P)))
Similarly, it must be possible for A to plan for S to
tell A the referent of a description, without A knowing
the referent. This is the role of the INFORMREF act.
INFORMREF(speaker, hearer, D(x))
prec: KNOWREF(speaker,D(x)) A
W(speaker,INFORMREF(speaker,
hearer,D(x)))
effect: KNOWREF(hearer,D(x))
body: B(hearer,W(speaker,KNOWREF(
hearer,D(x))))
Request is defined as:
REQUEST(speaker, hearer, action)
constraint: hearer is agent of action
The intention of a request is to get the hearer to
want to do the action, and this is accomplished by
getting the hearer to believe that the speaker wants
the hearer to do the action and then depending on the
hearer to decide to do it. To explicitly represent this
decision process, a CAUSE TO WANT act defined
along the lines of the DECIDE TO BELIEVE act
above is necessary.
CAUSE TO WANT(agent, other, P)
prec: B(other,B(agent,W(agent,P)))
effect: W(other,P)
As examples of the use of speech acts, &amp;quot;Tell me
whether the train is here&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Is the train here?&amp;quot;,
intended literally, are both REQUESTs by A that S
INFORMIF the train is here. &amp;quot;When does the train
arrive?&amp;quot;, intended literally, is a REQUEST by A that
H INFORMREF of the departure time of the train.
Finally we define the two surface level acts:
S.INFORM produces indicative mood utterances, and
S.REQUEST produces imperative utterances, or inter-
rogative utterances, if the requested act is an IN-
FORM. These acts have no preconditions, and serve
solely to signal the immediate intention of the speaker,
the starting point for all the hearer&apos;s inferencing.
S.INFORM(speaker, hearer, P)
effect: B(hearer,W(speaker,KNOW(hearer,P)))
S.REQUEST(speaker, hearer, action)
effect: B(hearer,W(speaker,action(hearer)))
The effects of S.INFORM match the body of the IN-
FORM act, reflecting the fact that it is a standard way
of executing an INFORM. It is important, however,
that S.INFORM is only one way of executing an IN-
FORM. The same relationship holds between the
S.REQUEST and REQUEST actions.

All inferencing by S of A&apos;s plans starts from S&apos;s
recognition that A intended to perform one of the
surface acts, and that A in fact wanted to do the act.
All inference chains will be shown as starting from a
formula of the form BsWA(A do the surface act). The
object of the inferencing is to find what illocutionary
level act(s) A intended to perform. The action-effect
rule applied to the starting formula yields one of the
form BsWA(BsWA(P)), i.e. S believes that A wants S
to recognize A&apos;s intention that P. The inferencing
process searches for plausible formulas of the form
BsWA(IA(A)) where IA is an illocutionary level act.

6 To improve readability of inference chains in the examples,
we drop the prefix BsWA from all propositions. The formula on
line (n) follows from the one on line (n-1) by the rule at the begin-
ning of line (n). Applications of EI.1 will be labelled &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot;/EI.1,
where &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; is a PI rule embedded by EI.1. Similarly, applications
of EI.2 and EI.3 will be labelled &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot;/EI.2 and &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot;/EI.3,
where &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; is a PC rule name.
evaluated with respect to what S believes A believes.
(Remember that BsWA should appear as a prefix to all
propositions in inference chains.) If BsBAWs(ACT(S))
is true, the request interpretation is considered unlike-
ly, by the effect-based heuristic. In addition, the pre-
conditions of ACT(S) are considered with respect to
what S believes A believes S believes. This step will
only be reasonable if S can do the action, by a
precondition-based heuristic.
To make more explicit the distinction between in-
ferences in BsWA and inferences in BsWABsWA, let
us consider two inference chains that demonstrate two
interpretations of the utterance &amp;quot;Do you know the
secret?&amp;quot;. Lines 1-3 of Example 2 show the chain
which leads S to believe that A asked a (literal)
yes/no question; lines 1-6 of Example 3 show the
interpretation as a request to S to inform A of the
secret. Notice that in both interpretations S may be
led to believe that A wants to know the secret. In the
literal case, S infers A&apos;s goal from the literal interpre-
tation, and may tell the secret simply by being helpful
(lines 4-9). In the indirect case, S recognizes A&apos;s
intention that S inform A of the secret (lines 1-6).
Telling the secret is then conforming to A&apos;s intentions
(lines 7-9).
There is in fact a third interpretation of this sen-
tence. If A and S both know that A already knows
the secret, then the utterance could be intended as
&amp;quot;If you don&apos;t know the secret, I will tell it to you.&amp;quot;
This requires recognizing a conditional action and is
beyond our present abilities.

4.3. The Level of Embedding Heuristic
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999171842105263">
Two sets of PI rules are applicable to formulas of
the form BsWABsWA(P): the simple rules PI.1 to PI.6
operating &amp;quot;within&amp;quot; the prefix BsWA, and the rules
generated by EI.1 and EI.3 which allow the simple
rules to apply within the prefix BsWABsWA. To re-
flect the underlying assumption in our model that in-
tention will always be attributed if possible, the infer-
ences at the most deeply nested level should be prefer-
red.
Of course, if the inferences at the nested level lead
to unlikely plans, the inferences at the &amp;quot;shallow&amp;quot; lev-
els may be applied. In particular, if there are multiple
mutually exclusive inferences at the nested level, then
the &amp;quot;shallow&amp;quot; inferences will be preferred. This re-
flects the fact that the nested inferences model what
the speaker intends the hearer to infer. If there are
many inferences possible at the nested level, the
speaker would not be able to ensure that the hearer
would perform the correct (i.e., the intended) one.

4.4. More Indirect Requests
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972644541666667">
Example 4 shows the interpretation of &amp;quot;I want you
to pass the salt&amp;quot; as a request. Taking the utterance
literally, S infers that A wants him to know that A
wants him to pass the salt. This yields proposition (2)
which leads through the next three inferences to the
intention that would be recognized from a request act,
i.e. that A wants S to pass the salt (5). Notice that an
application of the body-action rule to step (2) yields:
INFORM(A, S, WA(PASS(S, A, SALT))),
for, in fact, the speaker may be performing both
speech acts. The level of inferencing heuristic favours
the indirect form.
The key step in Example 5 is the application of the
know-positive rule from line (3) to line (4). Since,
given the context, S assumes that A knows whether S
has the salt, the literal interpretation (from (2)) would
not produce a reasonable goal for A. This supports
the nested know-positive inference, and attributes
further intention to the speaker (4). Once this is
done, it is easy to infer that A wants S to pass him the
salt (5), hence the request interpretation.
&amp;quot;Can you pass the salt?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Do you want to pass
the salt?&amp;quot; are treated similarly, for they inquire about
the preconditions on PASS(S, A, SALT).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.4515869">
Example 6 begins like Example 5, leading to the
inference that A wants S to be able to reach the salt
(4).7 Since being able to reach the salt is a precondi-
tion to reaching the salt (5), which then enables pass-
ing the salt (6), S can infer that he is being requested
to pass the salt. &amp;quot;Is the salt near you?&amp;quot; can be treated
in the same way, as being near the salt is a precondi-
tion on reaching the salt.
7 Let CANDO(S,ACT) be true if S believes the preconditions
of ACT are true.

An interesting example of an indirect INFORM is
4.5a for it is very similar to 4.5b-c which both seem to

indirect INFORM follows from the fact that inference

But such a goal is highly unlikely. A is attempting to
achieve the goal —Bs(P) by having S recognize that A
wants P to be true! As a result, no speech act inter-
pretation is possible from this step. For instance, the
bodies of the acts INFORM(A, S. P) and INFORM(A,
S, —P) are BsWA(P A Bs(P)), and BsWA(—P A
Bs(—P)), respectively. Both of these are contradicted
by part of 4.5d. Thus the know-negative possibility
can be eliminated. This allows the know-positive in-
ference to be recognized as intended, and hence leads
to the indirect interpretation as an INFORM(A, S, P).
4.5b has only a literal interpretation since both the
know-positive and know-negative rules are applicable
at the nested level; without a reason to favour either,
the literal
REQUEST(A,S,INFORMIF(S,A,Bs(P)))
is preferred. The interpretations of 4.5c are similar to
those of Examples 2 and 3.

4.6. Using Knowledge of Deduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99706725">
All the examples of indirect speech acts so far have
been explained in terms of rules PI.1-PI.6, and com-
plex inference rules derived from them. In this sec-
tion, we give one more example relying on somewhat
more specific rules. A full investigation of how many
such specific rules are necessary to account for com-
mon forms of indirect REQUESTs and INFORMs
remains to be done.
This example shows how a completely non-standard
form can be intended indirectly. Suppose that A tells
(4.6a) &amp;quot;John asked me to ask you to leave&amp;quot;
This has at least three possible interpretations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.80951275">
(4.6b) A is asking S to leave, and giving a reason.
(4.6c) A wants to simply report the fact to S
that John did the action of asking S to leave.
(4.6d) A wants to inform S that John wants
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98836155">
him to leave.
Interpretations c and d can hold even if S decides
that A actually does want him to leave. However, in
these cases, he would not say that A intended to com-
municate the intent that he leave, i.e. he would not say
the utterance was a REQUEST.
Both interpretations rely on axioms ACT.1 and
ACT.2 (of section 3.2) which state that if some agent
A believes that agent S executed some action ACT,
then A may believe that the preconditions of ACT
obtained before, and the effects of ACT obtained
after, the execution of ACT.
They also require a new PC/PI rule: if A wants S
to believe some proposition P, then A may get S to
believe some proposition Q, as long as A believes that
S believes that Q implies P.
(PC.!) WA(Bs(P)) =c=&gt; WA(Bs(Q)),
if BABs(Q P).
(PH) BsWA(Bs(Q)) =i=&gt; BsWA(Bs(P)),
if BsBABs(Q P).
In Example 9, S recognizes that A asked him to
leave. The interpretation depends on S concluding
that John performed his REQUEST successfully
(through PH and ACT.2), and hence that A wants to
request S to leave. It is then an easy step to infer that
A wants S to leave, which leads to the request inter-
pretation. Interpretation (c), a simple report of some
previous action, follows from (2) by PI.BA.
In Example 10, S recognizes that A intended to tell
him that John wants him to leave. This depends on
the fact that S concludes that John wanted to perform
the REQUEST that A reported. Most of the needed
inferences call for the use of EI.1 to embed simple
inference rules twice. Note that an INFORM act
could have been inferred at each of the four previous
steps; for example, from (5) the body inference would
produce
INFORM(A, S, Wj(REQUEST(A, S, LEAVE(S))).
But the inferences at the &amp;quot;BsWABsWj&amp;quot; level were so
direct that they were continued.

&amp;quot;John asked me to ask you to leave.&amp;quot; (Interpretation d)
However, in some ways both solutions are too strong.
Consider, for example, the following:
(5.a) Can you reach the salt?
(5.b) Are you able to reach the salt?
(5.c) I hereby ask you to tell me whether
you are able to reach the salt.
Although 5.a-c are all literally questions about the
hearer&apos;s ability, only 5.a normally conveys a request.
Sadock [1974] suggests that forms such as 5.a dif-
fer from 5.b in that the former is an idiom which is
directly a request while 5.b is primarily a yes/no ques-
tion. However, as Brown [1980] points out, this fails
to account for responses to 5.a which follow from its
literal form. One can answer &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; to 5.a and then
go on to pass the salt.
Brown proposes what she calls &amp;quot;frozen ISA forms&amp;quot;
which directly relate surface form and indirect illocu-
tionary force, bypassing the literal force. Frozen
forms differ from normal rules mapping illocutionary
forces to illocutionary forces in that they point to the
relevant normal rule which provides the information
necessary to the generation of responses to the surface
forms.
The speaker of 5.b or 5.c may in fact want the
hearer to reach the salt, as does the speaker of 5.a, but
he does not want his intention to be recognized by the
hearer. Thus it appears that from the hearer&apos;s point of
view the chain of inferences at the intended level
should get turned off, soon after the recognition of the
literal act. It seems that in this case (Example 6 of
section 4.4) the plausibility of the inferences after step
3 should be strongly decreased. Unfortunately it is
not obvious that this can be done without making ,the
rating heuristics sensitive to syntax.
The indirect interpretation can also be downgraded
in the presence of stronger expectations. If a speaker
entered a room full of aspiring candidates for employ-
ment and said: &amp;quot;I want to know how many people
here can write a sort/merge program&amp;quot; and then turn-
ing to each individually asked &amp;quot;Can you write a
sort/merge?&amp;quot; the question would not be intended as a
request to write a program, and would not be recog-
nized as such by a PI algorithm which rated highly an
illocutionary act which fits well in an expectation.
In several of the earlier examples of questions in-
tended as indirect requests, the literal interpretation is
blocked because it leads to acts whose effects were
true before the utterance. The literal interpretation of
5.d gets blocked because the reminding gets done as
part of the understanding of the literal act. Thus only
an indirect interpretation is possible.

6. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985477608695653">
We have given evidence in this paper for an ac-
count of indirect speech acts based on rationality (plan
construction), imputing rationality to others (plan
inference), surface speech act definitions relating form
to &amp;quot;literal&amp;quot; intentions, and illocutionary acts allowing a
variety of realizing forms for the same intentions.
The reader may object that we are suggesting a
complex solution to what appears to be a simple prob-
lem. It is important to distinguish here the general
explanation of indirect speech acts (which is presented
here partly through an algorithm) from the implemen-
tation of such an algorithm in a practical natural lan-
guage understanding system. We claim that the ele-
ments necessary for a theoretically satisfying account
of indirect speech acts are independently motivated. It
is almost certain that a computationally efficient solu-
tion to the indirect speech act problem would short-cut
many of the inference chains suggested here, although
we doubt that all searching can be eliminated in the
case of the less standard forms such as 4.6a. The
implementation in Brachman et al [1980] does just
that. However, the more fundamental account is nec-
essary to evaluate the correctness of the implementa-
tions.
Many problems remain. Other syntactic forms that
have significance with respect to illocutionary force
determination should be considered. For example, tag
questions such as
&amp;quot;John is coming to the party tonight, isn&apos;t he?&amp;quot;
have not been analysed here (but see Brown [19801).
Furthermore, no &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; questions have been
examined.
Besides the incorporation of more syntactic infor-
mation, another critical area that needs work concerns
the control of inferencing. To allow the use of spe-
cialized inferences, a capability that is obviously re-
quired by the general theory, much research needs to
be done outlining methods of selecting and restricting
such inferences.
This paper has concentrated on recognition. Allen
[1979] shows how the construction algorithms would
have to be modified to allow the generation of surface
acts, including indirect forms. McDonald [1980] dis-
cusses the planning of low-level syntactic form.
According to the definition of INFORM of section
4.1, any utterance that causes S to infer that A has a
plan to achieve KNOW(S,P) by achieving
BsWA(KNOW(S,P)) is considered by S to be an IN-
FORM. Strawson [1964] argues that one level of
recognition of intention is not sufficient for the defini-
tion of a speech act. Schiffer [1972] gives a series of
counterexamples to show that no finite number of
conditions of the form BsWA(BsWA(...(KNOW(S,P)))
is sufficient either. The solution he proposes is that
the recognition of intention must be mutually believed
between the speaker and the hearer. Cohen and Lev-
esque [1980] and Allen [forthcoming] show how the
speech act definitions given here can be extended in
this direction.
We have only considered acts to request and in-
form because many of their interesting properties can
be based on belief and want. At least primitive ac-
counts of the logics of these propositional attitudes are
available. Clearly there is room for much work here.
Extending the analysis to other speech acts, such as
promises, will require a study of other underlying log-
ics such as that of obligation.
There also remain many problems with the formali-
zation of actions. We believe this work shows that the
concepts of preconditions, effects, and action bodies
are fruitful in discussing plan recognition. The opera-
tor definitions for speech acts used here are intended
to facilitate the statement of the plan construction and
inference rules. However, their expressive power is
insufficient to handle complex actions involving se-
quencing, conditionals, disjunctions, iterations, paral-
lelism, discontinuity, and a fortiori requests and prom-
ises to do such acts. They are also inadequate, as
Moore [1979] points out, to express what the agent of
an action knows (and does not know) after the success
or failure of an act. Moore&apos;s logic of action includes
sequencing, conditionals, and iterations, and is being
applied to speech acts by Appelt [1980]. Much re-
mains to be done to extend it to parallel and disconti-
nuous actions typical of multiple agent situations.
These difficulties notwithstanding, we hope that we
have helped show that the interaction of logic, philoso-
phy of language, linguistics and artificial intelligence is
productive and that the whole will shed light on each
of the parts.

<abstract confidence="0.996677333333333">We propose an account of indirect forms of speech acts to request and inform based on the hypothesis that language users can recognize actions being performed by others, infer goals being sought, and cooperate in their achievement. This cooperative behaviour is independently motivated and may or may not be intended by speakers. If the hearer believes it is intended, he or she can recognize the speech act as indirect; otherwise it is interpreted directly. Heuristics are suggested to decide among the interpretations.</abstract>
