Several researchers have noted the local coherence exhibited by discourse (Sidner 1979;
Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Carter 1987; etc.). A primary component of this local
coherence is the way the localfocus of the discourse shifts from one sentence to the next
and the way this shifting is marked by linguistic choices made by the writer/speaker.
By local focus, we refer to that concept a sentence is most centrally about within the
discourse context in which it occurs. This is sometimes called the topic or center.
A local focusing framework typically consists of focus-tracking algorithms and
algorithms for suggesting referents for pronouns. Such a framework can be used in
conjunction with an inferencing mechanism to resolve pronouns (and other anaphora)
in a Natural Language Understanding system. The focusing framework suggests a
referent for a pronoun, and the inferencing mechanism then confirms or rejects the
suggested referent on the basis of semantic factors, i.e., semantics, world knowledge, etc.
The focusing framework is useful because it only requires an inferencing mechanism
to confirm a co-specification rather than requiring an inferencing to find the referent
independently.
To date, there have been two major frameworks for tracking the local focus from
one sentence to the next and for using focus during pronoun resolution. The first
framework, Focusing, was introduced by Sidner (1979). In this squib, we will describe
our framework, Revised Algorithms for Focus Tracking and Revised Algorithms for
Pronoun Resolution (RAFT/RAPR), which is based on Sidner &apos;s work. RAFT/RAPR
can be characterized as maintaining two foci for a sentence: the subject focus and the
current focus, which very often have distinct contents. RAFT/RAPR maintains a set of
data structures, and uses rules (which take grammatical roles into account) for pronoun
resolution and computing the foci. Taken together, these rules describe how focus can
(and is most likely to) shift from one sentence to the next. Note that focus tracking
and pronoun resolution are mutually dependent processes: focus tracking is necessary
for pronoun resolution, and pronoun resolution, in turn, affects focus tracking.

Subsequent to Sidner&apos;s work, Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983) introduced center-
ing to account for the same phenomena addressed by Sidner&apos;s algorithm.&apos; Centering
attempted to simplify processing by keeping fewer data structures than Sidner&apos;s frame-
work did. In particular, the centering literature claims that, rather than two foci, only
one focus is needed, termed the backward-looking center (CO. Pronoun resolution within
the centering framework is largely based on an ordering of preferred focus (centering)
moves.
Other research on discourse (e.g., Grosz 1981; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman
1978) has studied another phenomenon, the global focus of discourse. The term global
focus generally refers to the entity or set of entities that are relevant to or salient in the
overall discourse; the identification of global focus typically interacts with the identifi-
cation of discourse segments. Global focus and discourse segmentation are distinct from
the phenomenon of local focusing that is addressed in this paper. However, we should
point out that the centering literature has noted that centering &amp;quot;... is intended to oper-
ate within a [discourse] segment&amp;quot; (Walker 1989, p. 253). In our work on RAFT/RAPR
we do not restrict the domain of the algorithms to within a discourse segment.
Given that multiple frameworks for focus tracking and pronoun resolution have
emerged, we would like to do a comparison to see how the frameworks are the same
and how they differ. Previous assessments and comparisons of local focusing frame-
works have relied on comparing how frameworks process a small number of con-
structed discourses, but this kind of comparison is inadequate. Instead the question
that must be answered is which framework performs best on naturally occurring text.
However, such a comparison is not possible at this point because no framework has
fully specified how to handle complex sentences (see Suri [1993] for the details of this
argument).
In light of this, we propose a comparison of RAFT/RAPR and centering along two
lines. First, it is instructive to take a careful look at how the frameworks handle certain
kinds of constructed discourses involving simple sentences. This comparison proves
useful for understanding why the frameworks suggest the referents that they do. It
is interesting to note that, while the methodologies used in RAFT/RAPR and center-
ing are quite different from one another, the frameworks very often have the same
preferences for pronoun resolution for text that is not discourse-initial (nor discourse-
segment-initial) and that involves only simple sentences. Despite this similarity, we
point out places where the two frameworks differ. A major difference between center-
ing and RAFT/RAPR is that while RAFT/RAPR stacks old focus information, center-
ing keeps information about the previous sentence only. We show why this is problem-
atic for centering. We point out other differences that arise because centering keeps one
focus and does not take the grammatical roles of pronouns and potential antecedents
into account during pronoun resolution. This difference is evident in the examples
discussed in this paper involving discourse-initial text, and even in an example dis-
cussed in this paper that (we believe) does not involve a discourse segment boundary.
Note that because the centering literature claims that centering should operate only
within a discourse segment, and because this claim is used to explain some otherwise
problematic cases of pronoun use, not being able to adequately handle discourse seg-

ment initial text is much more of a problem for the centering frameworks than may
at first be apparent.
While the observations we make in this first comparison are intriguing, it would
be inappropriate to assess and compare the frameworks only on the basis of a handful
of constructed texts. However, in order to do a corpus analysis to compare focusing
frameworks one must be able to handle many kinds of complex sentences. Thus, we
developed a methodology for determining how people process a particular kind of
complex sentence.&apos; Our second line of comparison of frameworks involves studying
how well each framework can be extended to account for such findings. Suri (1993)
presented preliminary results for processing sentences of the form &amp;quot;SX because SY,&amp;quot;
where SX and SY each consist of a single clause. In this squib, we report some of those
findings, and discuss extending RAFT/RAPR and centering in light of these findings.
In closing, we summarize the abstract similarities and differences between centering
and RAFT/RAPR.

• Subject Focus (SF): the surface subject of the clause, except in certain
cases as mentioned later. (The need for an SF as well as a local focus is
discussed in Section 4.3.)

arid argues why this methodology is better than alternative methodologies.
3 Determining whether we truly need both a PFL and PSFL would require a corpus analysis, which is
beyond the capabilities of the current technology, as discussed in Suri (1993). In fact, the motivation for
maintaining both a PFL and a PSFL is based on processing complex sentences (see Suri 1993).

specifier, then the SF, then members of the PFL, and then, under preferences yet to be
determined, the members of the CF stack, SF stack, PFL stack, and PSFL stack.
We thus prefer the pronoun to co-refer with the last focus, then the subject focus
of the previous sentence, then some other NP introduced in the previous sentence,
and then elements that have been in focus or mentioned in previous sentences. Each
attempted co-specification may be rejected by a separate inferencing component on
the basis of semantic factors (semantics, world knowledge, etc.) or based on syntactic
constraints.
For a subject third person singular pronoun, we first try the SF, then the CF, then
members of the PSFL, then the stacked elements.

2.3 SF and CF Computation (in Simple Sentences)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98624825">
For a there-insertion sentence, the SF is the deep subject of the sentence, but for most
simple sentence types the SF is the surface subject of the simple sentence.&apos;
Our algorithms compute the CF of the current sentence based on the following
interacting criteria:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99630425">
1. Co-specification: Prefer elements that co-specify an element in a focusing
data structure over elements just introduced. If an element being talked
about now has been talked about before, it is more likely to be the topic
(and thus to continue to be talked about) than something that has just
been introduced.
2. The type of realization of each element: Prefer NPs realized as pronouns
over those realized with full NPs. A pronoun is more likely to be talked
about in subsequent text than a full NP (Brown 1983).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903666666667">
To appreciate this preference, consider the following. A pronoun carries
less semantic information than a full NP. If a writer chose to
communicate an element using a pronoun, he or she must have believed
that the element was highly focused enough that the reader would not
have difficulty interpreting the pronoun without the extra semantic
information that would be communicated with a full NP.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.563263">
3. Which focusing data structure, if any, is co-specified by each NP.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983286">
In general, we believe a writer/speaker is more likely to keep discussing
the focus than to move the local focus to some other discourse entity.
Thus, we prefer the CF to remain constant from one sentence to the next.
We refer to this preference as the focus retention preference. We also believe
a writer is more likely to switch focus to an element that was just
mentioned in the previous sentence than to one that was discussed
earlier. Thus, in sum, we prefer for the CF to co-specify the last CF
rather than something on the last PFL or the last SF, and we prefer for
the CF to co-specify something on the last PFL or the last SF rather than
a stacked element.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996952">
4. Syntax: We prefer for the CF to be a nonsubject rather than a subject,
although the CF can be the subject.

Linda Z. Sun i and Kathleen E McCoy RAFT/RAPR and Centering
Recall that we compute the SF based on subject NPs. We prefer for the
CF and SF to be distinct, and for the SF to be a subject and the CF to be
a nonsubject since we believe that it is often the case that there are two
elements that are being focused on, and we believe that a subject
pronoun is more likely to refer back to a subject and a nonsubject
pronoun is more likely to refer back to a nonsubject. Thus, we want to
record information in the focusing data structures in a manner that will
allow us to take the grammatical roles of potential antecedents into
account.
5. Syntactic forms and clue words: The use of a particular linguistic form
(e.g., a there-insertion structure) or clue words (e.g., &amp;quot;but&amp;quot;) also
influences the choice of the local focus.
Again, these (abstract) criteria interact in determining the choice of the CF. For ex-
ample, among nonsubject NPs co-specifying elements of the PFL, we prefer a pronoun
to a full NP; on the other hand, if the only pronoun is the subject, and it co-specifies
a member of the PFL, and a nonsubject nonpronoun co-specifies the CF, we will not
shift the CF to a member of the last PFL. That is, the CF will remain the same despite
the pronominalization. Also, we prefer a nonsubject nonpronominal NP co-specifying
a member of the PFL over a subject pronoun co-specifying the CF.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989375625">
For the first sentence, we compute the SF to be the surface subject, [Susan], and
the CF to be the direct object, [a Ferrari].
For S2, we first try to resolve the subject, &amp;quot;She,&amp;quot; using SF(S1); since this is not
rejected by inferencing with semantic factors and syntactic information, the pronoun
is resolved to refer to [Susan]. SF(S2)-= [Susan], the surface subject of the sentence. Since
the only co-specifier to something previously mentioned is [Susan], CF(S2)=[Susan] as
well.
For 53, we try to resolve the nonsubject pronoun &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; using CF(S2). Since this
is not rejected by inferencing with semantic factors and syntactic information, the
pronoun is resolved to refer to CF(S2), [Susan]. We compute SF(S3) to be the surface
subject, [Lyn]. Since [Susan] (&amp;quot;her&amp;quot;) is the only thing that specifies anything previously
mentioned, CF(S3)=[Susan].
In (S4), we first try to resolve &amp;quot;She&amp;quot; using the SF and &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; using the CF. This
interpretation is not rejected on the basis of inferencing with semantic factors or syn-
tactic information. Thus, we get the reading &amp;quot;Lyn often beats Susan,&amp;quot; which is the
same reading that native speakers of English preferred in an informal poll.

In this section, we give a brief introduction to the centering framework. This frame-
work was introduced by Grosz, joshi, and Weinstein (1983), it has been discussed
and/or expanded on in several other works, including Brennan, Friedman, and Pol-
lard (1987), Walker (1989, 1993), Kameyama (1986, 1993), Walker, Iida, and Cote (1992),

3.1 Computing Centers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987928571429">
For each utterance, centering computes the following (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983;
Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1992): the backward-looking
center (Cb), which is intended to capture that item which ties the current sentence in
with the previous sentence in the discourse, and a list of forward-looking centers (Cf),
or elements that can potentially be the Cb of the next sentence. For English, the Cf is
ordered or ranked by grammatical relations to the main verb (Walker 1989); the order
is &amp;quot;first the subject, object, and object2, followed by other subcategorized functions,
and finally adjuncts.&amp;quot; (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987, p. 156)
The first element of the Cf list is the preferred center or (Cp). As the name implies,
the Cp is the element that is considered most likely to become the Cb of the next
utterance.
After the first sentence, the Cb of utterance Un, Cb(Un), is the highest ranked
element of the Cf of the previous utterance, Cf(Un-1), that is realized in the current
utterance. We will refer to this condition as the Cb constraint.

<bodyText confidence="0.99861425">
The centering literature has identified four kinds of transitions between sentences
(Walker, Iida, and Cote 1992), where Un is the current utterance, and Un-1 is the

and smooth-shifting is preferred over shifting. (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987;
Walker, Iida, and Cote 1992).
In resolving pronouns, the Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) (and Walker,
!Ma, and Cote [19921) algorithm uses Rule 1, Rule 2, and the Cb constraint. Basically, the
algorithm generates all possible co-specifications for pronouns in the current sentence
by generating all possible Cb and Cf pairs for the current sentence (corresponding to
various co-specifications), and then it filters and ranks these possible co-specifications.
Filtering eliminates co-specifications that violate the Cb constraint or Rule 1, and co-
specifications involving contraindexing problems. The ranking of co-specifications is
based on the Rule 2 transition preferences. In this way, the algorithm proposes co-
specifications for pronouns that comply with the constraints and rules of centering,
in an order that corresponds to centering&apos;s preferences for centering moves. Notice
that the Cb of the current sentence is computed as a side effect of doing the pronoun
resolution.

3.3 Example 1 with Centering

4) She often beats her.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997539333333333">
According to the Cb constraint, Cb(4)=[Lyn], since Lyn is the highest ordered
element of Cf(3). Thus, if &amp;quot;She&amp;quot; were [Lyn] arid &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; were [Susan], then Cb(4)=[Lyn],
Cp(4)=[Eyn], and this would be a smooth shift. But, if &amp;quot;She&amp;quot; were [Susan] and &amp;quot;her&amp;quot;
were [Lyn], then Cb(4)=[Lyni, Cp(4)=[Susan], and this would be a shift. Thus, centering
prefers the reading &amp;quot;[Lyn] often beats [Susan].&amp;quot; Thus, centering and RAFT/RAPR
agree on how to resolve these pronouns.

4. Discussion of Some Differences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9337575">
Although centering and RAFT/RAPR seem to resolve pronouns similarly in many
cases, there are some situations where the two algorithms differ.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99997">
4.1 Stacking Focus Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993714285714">
A major difference between the two frameworks is that by maintaining stacks of CFs
and SFs,. RAFT/RAPR allows a writer to pronominally refer to a CF or SF of a sentence
before the previous one. Centering, which has no counterpart to our stacks, does not.
The stacking of focusing information for RAFT/RAPR (or focusing algorithms in
general) is motivated by examples of text in which the referent of a pronoun is more
than one sentence back, and for which there is no indication that there is an intervening
discourse segment. Example 2 is such an example.

Note that one might argue that the sentence &amp;quot;She had picked out sonic artwork&amp;quot;
constitutes a discourse segment unto itself marked by the use of the past perfect (note
the simple past is used in other sentences).6 However, even if this were the case (and
that sentence was ignored in the pronoun resolution), the centering framework would
still not appropriately resolve the &amp;quot;He&amp;quot; in the final sentence because there would
still be an intervening sentence (&amp;quot;The walls were Sheetrock and bare.&amp;quot;) that does not
contain the antecedent of &amp;quot;He.&amp;quot; We can see no reason why this (other) intervening
sentence should be seen as a discourse segment.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.983746">
4.2 Discourse-Initial Sentences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984996">
Recall that centering bases its pronoun decisions on the type of &amp;quot;centering&amp;quot; transitions
that would be manifested by various interpretations. These transitions require that the
Cb of the previous sentence be defined. As a result, centering can make no predic-
tions about pronouns until the third sentence in a discourse (segment). Consider the
following:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.677649333333333">
Example 3
la) Lyn races Susan on weekends.
2a) She races Jack during the week.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9540582">
Because no Cb is established in la (since la is discourse-initial), centering makes
no prediction as to whether the pronoun in 2a should refer to [Lyn] or [Susan]. Our
pronoun resolution algorithrns, predict that &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; is [Lyn], the SF of la.
Of course, one way around this problem is for a likely Cb for the first sentence
to be calculated and used in pronoun resolution. For instance, because subjecthood is
very important in centering, one might take the subject (or Cp) of a discourse-initial (or
discourse-segment-initial) sentence as its Oa! This would allow centering to resolve
the referent of &amp;quot;She&amp;quot; for this text correctly. However, such a decision would_ cause
centering to resolve &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; in 2b below incorrectly:
Example 4
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5969525">
lb) Lyn races Susan on weekends.
2b) Jack races her during the week.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999760375">
An informal poll suggests that native speakers prefer to interpret &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; as referring
to [Susan]. The problem here is that for centering, if there is a single pronoun in a
sentence, it becomes the Cb, and centering prefers to resolve the Cb so that it co-refers
with the Cb of the previous sentence regardless of the grammatical role of the Cb in
the previous sentence. Thus, if centering is to stay within its paradigm which was set
up for processing discourse segment internal pronouns, it will resolve a pronoun in
one of these two examples inappropriately. (Notice no semantic or world knowledge
inference could flag the mistake.)

Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) discuss an ambiguous discourse. (A modified
version is shown in Example 5 below.) Centering resolves the ambiguous pronoun
(&amp;quot;She&amp;quot; in 4) one way, and RAFT/RAPR resolves it another way. This is not particularly
interesting since the discourse is ambiguous.
Example 5

4) She wins a lot of trophies.

<bodyText confidence="0.813732">
What is more interesting is that if &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; in 3 is replaced by a full NP, then readers
do have a strong preference for the pronoun to be resolved with [Lyn].

Notice that RAFT/RAPR computes the &amp;quot;She&amp;quot; in 4 to be [Lyn] since it prefers to
resolve subject pronouns to be the SF of the previous sentence. This interpretation
agrees with native speaker preferences for this text. On the other hand, centering
computes the Cb in 3 to be [Susan] and as a result it will prefer that &amp;quot;She&amp;quot; is [Susan]
in 4 (by preferring a continue transition). Thus, centering&apos;s prediction does not agree
with native speakers&apos; preferences for this text.
The problem for centering may be viewed as resulting from the fact that if a
sentence, Un, has only one pronoun, then centering (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard
1987) makes that element the Cb(Un) (assuming it co-specifies something in Cf(Un-1)),
and centering prefers to resolve pronouns so that Cb(Un)=Cb(Un-1) regardless of the
grammatical roles that Cb(Uri4) played in Un-1.
Because our algorithms track two foci and consider the grammatical roles of a
pronoun and its possible antecedents during pronoun resolution (by preferring the

resolving pronouns in certain situations. However, she does not address the discourse-initial problems.

transition preferences, but whether this is true in all contexts is not immediately evident.

One way around this example is for centering to claim that 3 actually starts a new
discourse segment.&apos; However, recall that centering is intended to operate within a
discourse segment and discourse-segment-initial processing is problematic for center-
ing (see Section 4.2). Thus, more work would still be required to enable centering to
handle pronouns in Example 6 and the identical discourse with the fourth sentence

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991117">
4.4 What Is the Import of the Above Analysis?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999416">
Two observations should be made at this point. First, it is very difficult to identify
the focus of a discourse-initial sentence, and neither framework is likely to process all
discourse-initial text correctly. This in itself is not terribly problematic, since discourse-
initial text is relatively rare (since there is only one discourse-initial sentence for each
naturally occurring text).&apos; The problem for centering is compounded, however, since
centering is intended to work within a discourse segment. This means that all discourse-
segment-initial text will be problematic. The proportion of discourse-segment-initial text
is much larger. This fact is much more evident if one notes that presumably all cases
where a stack is needed by RAFT/RAPR (see Section 4.1) are cases where a centering
theorist would need to argue for an intervening discourse segment.
Second, the reader should observe that we have pointed out a potential problem
for centering by citing two examples .(Examples 3 and 4) that could not both be han-
dled by centering. This is clearly insufficient. In fact, while RAFT/RAPR does handle
both of these examples appropriately, there is no doubt that one could come up with
a discourse-initial example where RAFT/RAPR would have difficulty.&apos; The question
that must be addressed is which framework would correctly process the most naturally
occurring discourse-initial texts. Likewise, in Section 4.3 we showed that RAFT/RAPR
could appropriately handle a non-discourse-initial text, which centering could not.
But, again, the question we would want to address is which framework would cor-
rectly process the most naturally occurring non-discourse-initial texts. The intent of the
above analysis was to point out differences in the abstract/underlying preferences of
the two frameworks, and how those differences manifest themselves during pronoun
resolution. In particular, RAFT /RAPR&apos;s abstract/underlying preference for consider-
ing both the grammatical role of a pronoun and the grammatical roles of its potential
antecedents is not shared by centering.

9 Note that the tracking of two foci is important in order to correctly handle this text and Example 5 with
sentence 4 changed to &amp;quot;Jack races her during the week.&amp;quot;
10 In fact, that &amp;quot;Susan&amp;quot; is not pronominalized in S3 does seem to signal a shift in subject focus from
[Susan] to [Lyn]. But whether this would constitute a new discourse segment is unclear. Furthermore,
to rely on the claim that this is a new discourse segment, centering would need to better specify how
to identify the start of a new discourse segment, and to better specify how to handle discourse-initial
and discourse-segment-initial text.
11 Furthermore, it is a bit odd to speak of the focus or foci (e.g., CF and SF) of a discourse-initial sentence,
since it is usually difficult for a reader to determine what the topic of a discourse-initial sentence is
from the discourse-initial sentence alone.
12 in particular, we think that there are likely to be texts that do not involve the kind of &amp;quot;parallel verb
structures&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;NP1 races NP2 ....exhibited in the examples discussed above for which centering
would predict the correct referent, but RAFT/RAPR would not.

inadequate. A better comparison of the the two frameworks might be based on a large
corpora analysis to determine which framework gets the correct pronoun resolution
more often and by suggesting the fewest number of referents on average. There are
a number of problems one faces when trying to do a corpora analysis. One problem
is that pronoun resolution is affected not only by focusing information, but also by
semantic factors. In order to identify which framework best captures the pronoun
resolution preferences speakers have based solely on the type of information intended to
be captured by focusing frameworks, we would need to control for how often semantic
factors are affecting pronoun resolution.
In this squib, we are concerned with another, perhaps more interesting, prob-
lem that precludes undertaking a corpora analysis: although complex sentences are
prevalent in written English, neither framework has explicitly specified how to han-
dle complex sentences.&apos; In fact, some previous research handled complex sentences
in an inconsistent manner (Sidner 1979; Linson 1993). Other research made claims that
were not accurate because it did not acknowledge the need to specify how to process
complex sentences. in particular, centering literature (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983)
questioned Sidner&apos;s use of an Actor Focus using text that involved complex sentences.
Suri (1992) argued that the reason Sidner&apos;s algorithms could not handle that text was
not because they used two foci, but because a method for processing of complex sentences
was not specified.
The central question is whether one should process a complex sentence as mul-
tiple sentences or as a single sentence. For instance, should the clauses of a complex
sentence be processed in linear order, updating the focusing (e.g., RAFT/RAPR or
centering) data structures as if one were processing a linear sequence of simple sen-
tences? Or, is some other order more appropriate? More specifically, 1) How do you
resolve pronouns within a complex sentence? Do you prefer to resolve a pronoun in a
noninitial clause with elements from the previous clause (or the matrix clause) or with
elements from the previous sentence? 2) How do you resolve pronouns in a subsequent
sentence? In other words, how should one update focusing (e.g., RAFT/RAPR or cen-
tering) data structures after a complex sentence? Answers must be provided based on
the kinds of syntactic structures (e.g., sentential verb complements, conjunctions) used
in the sentence. Answers might also depend on other things, such as whether a verb
is subject-control or object-control (e.g., processing &amp;quot;NP1 promised NP2 SX&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;NPI
persuaded NP2 SX&amp;quot;).
Sufi and McCoy (1993) proposed a two-part methodology for determining how to
process a given kind of complex sentence. (Suri [1993] explains why this methodology
is superior to alternative methodologies.) Note that a local focusing framework (e.g.,
RAFT/RAPR or centering) is intended to capture preferences for pronoun resolution
independent of world knowledge, semantics, and rhetorical relations. Thus, the aim of
the first part of the methodology is to identify how people prefer to resolve pronouns
based on previous pronominalization, focus history, and syntax. Because it is difficult
to create texts where pronoun resolution is not affected by world knowledge, seman-
tics, and rhetorical relations, we develop texts that are intentionally semantically slanted
for pronoun interpretation based on world knowledge, semantics, and rhetorical re-
lations. Several semantically slanted texts are created in order to test the effect of the
syntactic form of interest (e.g., &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot;) on pronoun resolution within the
complex sentence, and in a sentence following that kind of complex sentence. We then
13 Soli (1992) identified the need to address this problem, and made some preliminary proposals for
particular sentence types. Walker (1989) indicated that centering needs to handle multiple subjects, but
did not specify how to do that.

gather judgments about the acceptability of these texts from native English speakers.
These judgments suggest that the readers&apos; preferences are based on syntax, pronomi-
nalization, and focusing history. For example, judgments suggested that readers prefer
the subject of the SX clause over the subject of the previous sentence when resolving
a subject in the SY clause of an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence. That is, when this hypothe-
sized preference agreed with the semantic-slanting of the text, the text was judged acceptable. But
when this hypothesized preference was at odds with the slanting of the text, the text was judged
awkward or ambiguous.&amp;quot; We then verify such findings by analyzing the use of anaphors
(within and following sentences of the form of interest) in naturally occurring text.

<bodyText confidence="0.999908">
Based on our analysis of grammaticality judgments from native speakers of seman-
tically slanted discourses involving a simple sentence, an &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentence
(S„), and a simple sentence, we concluded (Suri and McCoy 1993):

<listItem confidence="0.9966995">
1. Readers prefer to resolve Subject(SX) with Subject(Sn—i).

3. Readers prefer to resolve Subject(Sn+i) with Subject(SX).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99465">
Note that these preferences&apos; refute an assumption sometimes made by researchers
regarding complex sentences: that the clauses of complex sentences can be processed
in a linear order. While our findings indicate that the pronoun resolution within S2 does
happen linearly, the appropriate contents of the focusing data structures after processing
S2 should be much more heavily influenced by the SX clause (and not by the SY clause,
as the previous assumption would require).
Given these findings, we extended RAFT/RAPR to process sentences of the form
&amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9492042">
1. For resolving a Subject(SX) pronoun, first propose SF(S1) as the

3. Compute the SF of a sentence of the form &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; to be
Subject(SX).

<bodyText confidence="0.9994765">
These extensions allow RAFT/RAPR to propose antecedents for discourses of the
same form as the discourses judged to be acceptable more efficiently than for dis-
courses of the same form as those judged to be awkward. In this way, the RAFT/RAPR
processing would &amp;quot;match&amp;quot; native speakers&apos; judgments.

find:

This text looks highly coherent according to centering, but it was judged to be
awkward or ambiguous by native speakers of English in a controlled survey (judg-
ments gathered were: 3 acceptable; 23 awkward; 5 ambiguous). One might conclude
that the apparent problem for centering stems from violating the conclusion that the
text should not be processed linearly. Consider altering centering so that the Cb and
Cp of S2 is chosen from the SX clause in a manner consistent with the solution for
RAFT/RAPR that we outlined above. Let&apos;s look at Example 7 using this modification:

<table confidence="0.9399249375">
Example 7 Cb—Dodge?; Cf=Dodge, ex-con, night.

S2) The ex-convict tied him up because
he wasn&apos;t cooperating.
S3b) # Then he started screaming for
help.
Centering would still predict that this text should be highly coherent, although
the text was judged awkward or ambiguous by native speakers.16 Furthermore, let&apos;s
look at another example:
Example 8 Cb=Dodge?; Cf=Dodge, ex-con, night.
Si) Dodge was robbed by an ex-convict Cb=Dodge; Cf=ex-con, Dodge; retain?
the other night. Cb—ex-con; Cf—ex-con; smooth-shift
S2) The ex-convict tied him up because
he wasn&apos;t cooperating.

This text would probably also be judged acceptable/coherent by centering using
this strategy, and it is acceptable to native speakers (judgments gathered were: 29
acceptable; 3 awkward). What is interesting to note is that this example would probably
be considered less acceptable than Example 7, since this example ends in a smooth-shift
while the other ends in a continue.

complex sentence preceding a sentence starting with &amp;quot;Now,&amp;quot; her results suggest one
should study whether sentences starting with &amp;quot;Then&amp;quot; are more likely to be followed

appropriate corresponding revision of centering&apos;s Rule 2 would allow centering, like
RAFT/RAPR, to propose antecedents for discourses of the same form as Example 8,
i.e., discourses judged to be acceptable, more efficiently than for discourses of the same
form as Example 7, i.e., those judged to be awkward or ambiguous. Therefore, further
study of complex sentences and clue words such as &amp;quot;Then&amp;quot; is needed.

In sum, we extended RAFT/RAPR to process sentences of the form &amp;quot;SX because SY,&amp;quot; in

how to resolve pronouns in this kind of sentence and how to update the focusing
data structures after processing this kind of sentence. However, there appears to be
no similarly straightforward way to extend the existing centering framework to reflect

There are a number of distinctions between RAFT/RAPR and centering that should be

• RAFT/RAPR maintains two foci: a subject focus and a current focus.

• RAFT/RAPR resolves pronouns by searching data structures in an order
based on several factors, including the importance of grammatical roles
and preferences for focusing movement. Centering resolves pronouns by
generating all possible co-specifications and then filtering and ranking
them based on a number of constraints and rules.
• By using Rule I to eliminate possible co-specifiers, centering mixes the
process of pronoun resolution with focus computation. The RAFT/RAPR
approach resolves pronouns and then updates the focus. Furthermore,
although RAFT/RAPR recognizes pronominalization as a signal of focus
when computing the CF, it does not apply a rule like centering&apos;s Rule I

17 Related to this matter, when we gave readers the same discourses discussed earlier with the &amp;quot;Then&amp;quot;

were more divided than for the discourses including the &amp;quot;Then.&amp;quot; This supports the possibility that
&amp;quot;Then&amp;quot; may he playing a role in the pronoun resolution for the 53 sentences. See Sun (1993) for further
discussion,
18 However, we note the Cp is very similar to the SF in that both are computed (for English) to be the
surface subject of the sentence (for simple sentences). In this way, one could argue that centering does
track two foci, to the same extent that RAFT/RAPR does.

without considering the grammatical roles of anaphors and focusing
history.
• Because the abstract preferences underlying the frameworks share much in
common, the approaches very often make the same predictions.
RAFT/RAPR&apos;s focusing and pronoun resolution algorithms reflect the
following underlying abstract preferences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.688143375">
1. We prefer for the CF to be something that is co-referential with
an element mentioned earlier in the discourse.
2. We prefer for the CF to be a pronoun rather than a full definite
description.
3. We use preferences for resolving pronouns and computing the
CF that involve the grammatical role of the pronoun.
4. We prefer for the CF to be the same as the last CF and the SF to
be the same as the last SF.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971945441176471">
Centering shares the first two of these in common with us. But, centering
prefers the local focus to stay the same and for the subject to be the local
focus (which is stronger than preference 4). As noted earlier, we do not
apply preference 2 without regard for the grammatical roles of the NPs
and which focusing data structures they co-specify. Furthermore,
centering invokes the second preference during pronoun resolution,
while we invoke it only after resolving the pronouns. In addition,
centering requires that the focus (Cb) realizes an element in the
immediately preceding sentence, as opposed to merely preferring for the
focus to be something in the immediately preceding sentence but
allowing it instead to be co-referential with an element further back in
the preceding text (as RAFT/RAPR does).
In sum, the order in which these abstract preferences are applied differs
between the two frameworks. Furthermore, as a result of (some)
differences between the frameworks with respect to these preferences,
resolving a pronoun to have the same grammatical role as its antecedent
is less important in centering than it is in RAFT/RAPR (Section 4.3).
• RAFT/RAPR presents possible referents for pronouns one possibility at a
time, and if pragmatic, semantic, and general knowledge inferencing
rejects a referent, RAFT/RAPR proposes an alternative. Centering, on the
other hand, (in addition to requiring this same kind of inferencing)
sometimes suggests multiple possibilities for the co-specifications of
pronouns in a sentence (Walker 1989). Is pragmatic inferencing applied
at this point to pick among the possible antecedents? We assume this to
be the case, otherwise it is not clear how centering will choose among
the multiple potential referents. Yet, assuming this is the case, centering
seems to involve more complex inferencing than our approach involves;
inferencing for centering must pick which antecedent is better.
RAFT/RAPR only asks inferencing to confirm a co-specification.&apos;
19 We do not check for ambiguity of pronouns in the same way that Sidner did, However, even if we
were to incorporate similar checks for ambiguity, such checks would involve using inferencing to
confirm two possible co-specifications for a pronoun, while centering might require the use of
inferencing to confirm more than two. Thus, the inferencing required by RAFT/RAPR would still be
more limited than that required by centering.

7. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999797482758621">
RAFT/RAPR and centering often make the same predictions for resolving pronouns.
One reason for this is that the (abstract) preferences underlying the two frameworks
share much in common. A major difference between the two approaches is that
RAFT/RAPR keeps two foci, while centering keeps only one. In addition, RAFT/RAPR
has more of a commitment to resolving pronouns according to grammatical role.
In Section 5, we argued that one is able to extend RAFT/RAPR to process sentences
of the form &amp;quot;SX because SY,&amp;quot; by specifying how to resolve pronouns and how to update
RAFT/RAPR data structures, to match speaker preferences for discourses involving
sentences of that form. On the other hand, centering could not be extended in a similar
manner. Recent work (Section 5.3) suggests that centering might be able to match
judgments by modifying Rule 2; however, the appropriateness of such a modification
requires further study.
We presented examples of discourse-initial texts (Section 4.2) and a non-discourse-
initial text (Section 4.3) involving only simple sentences that were problematic for
centering. A second problem for centering results from not stacking focus information.
Although the claims in this paper are based on a limited number of discourses,
we noted that it is difficult to perform a corpora analysis to determine which frame-
work performs better on average because of the prevalence of complex sentences and
the lack of work on complex sentences in either framework. Furthermore, determining
how to process particular kinds of complex sentences is a crucial step toward enabling
such a corpora analysis. We discussed the results of an analysis of one kind of complex
sentence (&amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot;). On the basis of this analysis, we extended RAFT/RAPR
to handle this kind of complex sentence. In addition, we showed how the judgments
collected from native speakers of English as part of this analysis were difficult to ex-
plain within the current centering framework. Furthermore, the findings discussed in
this paper indicate that one cannot evaluate the RAFT/RAPR and centering frame-
works by simply applying the algorithms to finite clauses of naturally occurring text
in linear order, without taking into account the occurrence of complex sentences and
clue words.

Co-specification: Prefer elements that co-specify an element in a focusing data structure over elements just introduced. If an element being talked about now has been talked about before, it is more likely to be the topic (and thus to continue to be talked about) than something that has just been introduced. 2. The type of realization of each element: Prefer NPs realized as pronouns over those realized with full NPs. A pronoun is more likely to be talked about in subsequent text than a full NP (Brown 1983). To appreciate this preference, consider the following. A pronoun carries less semantic information than a full NP. If a writer chose to communicate an element using a pronoun, he or she must have believed that the element was highly focused enough that the reader would not have difficulty interpreting the pronoun without the extra semantic information that would be communicated with a full NP. 3. Which focusing data structure, if any, is co-specified by each NP. In general, we believe a writer/speaker is more likely to keep discussing the focus than to move the local focus to some other disc</context>

This framework was introduced by Grosz, joshi, and Weinstein (1983), it has been discussed and/or expanded on in several other works, including Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), Walker (1989, 1993), Kameyama (1986, 1993), Walker, Iida, and Cote (1992), Brennan (1993), Kameyama, Passonneau, and Poesio (1993), Linson (1993), and Hoffman and Turan (1993). 3.1 Computing Centers For each utterance, centering computes the following (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1992): the backward-looking center (Cb), which is intended to capture that item which ties the current sentence in with the previous sentence in the discourse, and a list of forward-looking centers (Cf), or elements that can potentially be the Cb of the next sentence.

The focusing framework suggests a referent for a pronoun, and the inferencing mechanism then confirms or rejects the suggested referent on the basis of semantic factors, i.e., semantics, world knowledge, etc. The focusing framework is useful because it only requires an inferencing mechanism to confirm a co-specification rather than requiring an inferencing to find the referent independently. To date, there have been two major frameworks for tracking the local focus from one sentence to the next and for using focus during pronoun resolution. The first framework, Focusing, was introduced by Sidner (1979). In this squib, we will describe our framework, Revised Algorithms for Focus Tracking and Revised Algorithms for Pronoun Resolution (RAFT/RAPR), which is based on Sidner &apos;s work. RAFT/RAPR can be characterized as maintaining two foci for a sentence: the subject focus and the current focus, which very often have distinct contents. RAFT/RAPR maintains a set of data structures, and uses rules (which take grammatical roles into account) for pronoun resolution and computing the foci. Taken together, these rules describe how focus can (and is most likely to) shift from one sentence to the next. Not</context>

While the observations we make in this first comparison are intriguing, it would be inappropriate to assess and compare the frameworks only on the basis of a handful of constructed texts. However, in order to do a corpus analysis to compare focusing frameworks one must be able to handle many kinds of complex sentences. Thus, we developed a methodology for determining how people process a particular kind of complex sentence.&apos; Our second line of comparison of frameworks involves studying how well each framework can be extended to account for such findings. Suri (1993) presented preliminary results for processing sentences of the form &amp;quot;SX because SY,&amp;quot; where SX and SY each consist of a single clause. In this squib, we report some of those findings, and discuss extending RAFT/RAPR and centering in light of these findings. In closing, we summarize the abstract similarities and differences between centering and RAFT/RAPR. 2. Our Focusing and Pronoun Resolution Algorithms Below, we discuss the behavior of our algorithms for simple (i.e., single-clause) sentences. (See Suri [1993] for a fuller discussion of our focusing and pronoun resolution algorithms, and a di</context>

We stack the foci and foci lists after each sentence. (See Section 4.1.) 2.2 Resolving Pronouns (in Simple Sentences) RAFT/RAPR resolves pronouns based on the grammatical role of the pronoun and the focusing data structures from the previous sentence. For a nonsubject third person 2 Suri (1993) discusses the issues that one faces in trying to determine how to process complex sentences, arid argues why this methodology is better than alternative methodologies. 3 Determining whether we truly need both a PFL and PSFL would require a corpus analysis, which is beyond the capabilities of the current technology, as discussed in Suri (1993). In fact, the motivation for maintaining both a PFL and a PSFL is based on processing complex sentences (see Suri 1993). 303 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 singular pronoun, our algorithm first proposes the CF (of the last sentence) as the</context>

Thus, if centering is to stay within its paradigm which was set up for processing discourse segment internal pronouns, it will resolve a pronoun in one of these two examples inappropriately. (Notice no semantic or world knowledge inference could flag the mistake.) 6 We discuss aspectual classification and the possible import for focusing and pronoun resolution in Suri (1993). 7 In fact, this is what Brennan, Priedman, and Pollard (1987) appear to do for their examples. 308 Linda Z. Suri and Kathleen E McCoy RAFT/RAPR and Centering Our algorithms consider the grammatical role played by a pronoun and its potential antecedents. They correctly resolve the pronouns in these examples.8 4.3 Pronominalization and Grammatical Roles Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) discuss an ambiguous discourse. (A modified version is shown in Example 5 below.) Centering resolves the ambiguous pronoun (&amp;quot;She&amp;quot; in 4) one way, and RAFT/RAPR resolves it another way.

However, we find several problematic cases for centering in processing this kind of complex sentence. First, consider the approach of processing &amp;quot;SX because SY&amp;quot; sentences one clause at a time, linearly, where the centering information from SY will be used in processing 53. (Note: this kind of processing for extending 14 See Suri and McCoy (1993) or Suri (1993) for a discussion of the methodology. 13 Results in Caramazza, Grober, Garvey, and Yates (1977) suggest that perhaps we should consider whether the verb in the SX clause is an NF1-bias or NP2-bias verb in formulating these preferences. 312 Linda Z. Suri and Kathleen F. McCoy RAFT/RAPR and Centering RAFT/RAPR was rejected by our analysis.) Under this approach, for Example 7, we find: Example 7 Cb=Dodge?; Cf=Dodge, ex-con, night.

Centering, on the other hand, (in addition to requiring this same kind of inferencing) sometimes suggests multiple possibilities for the co-specifications of pronouns in a sentence (Walker 1989). Is pragmatic inferencing applied at this point to pick among the possible antecedents? We assume this to be the case, otherwise it is not clear how centering will choose among the multiple potential referents.
