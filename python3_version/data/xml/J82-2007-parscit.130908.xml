At the 1982 Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics, held in Toronto, it was
decided to form a European Chapter. (More informa-
tion about this is included in the minutes of that meet-

Call for Papers - European Meeting
The first ever meeting of the European Chapter of
the Association for Computational Linguistics will be
held at the University of Pisa, Italy on Thursday, Sep-
tember 1 and Friday, September 2, 1983. Papers are
being solicited on linguistically and computationally
significant topics, including but not limited to the fol-
lowing:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9997005">
• syntax, parsing, and language generation,
• computational semantics,
• discourse analysis,
• speech analysis and synthesis,
• machine translation and machine-aided transla-
tion,
• automated dictionaries and lexical databases,
• mathematical and theoretical foundations of com-
putational linguistics,
• linguistic theories and their computational appli-
cations,
• software tools and programming languages for
computational linguistics, and
• representation of knowledge.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98199648">
An author wishing to present a paper should submit
six copies of a 5 to 8 page summary, double-spaced,
by January 31, 1983 to: Giacomo Ferrari, Istituto di
Linguistica Computazionale, Via della Faggiola 32,
1-56100 Pisa, ITALY.
It is important that the summary identify the new
ideas and clearly indicate to what extent the work is
complete and to what extent it has been implemented.
It should contain sufficient information to allow the
program committee to determine the scope of the work
and its relation to relevant literature.
All submissions will be read by the program com-
mittee, which is chaired by Giacomo Ferrari, Istituto di
Linguistica Computazionale, and consists of a panel of
referees.
Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their
papers by April 1, 1983. No full proceedings will be
published, but abstracts of papers accepted will appear
in the American Journal of Computational Linguistics.
The Program Committee may also recommend some
papers for full publication.

ing, contact: Harold Somers, Centre for Computa-
tional Linguistics, U.M.I.S.T., P.O. Box 88, Manches-
ter M60 1QD, ENGLAND.
