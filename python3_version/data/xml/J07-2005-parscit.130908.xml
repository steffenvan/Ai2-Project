Word sense disambiguation (WSD), the tagging of words in context with labels indi-
cating the sense in which the words are used, has become an increasingly popular
area of computational linguistics research. This is particularly due to the SENSEVAL
evaluation exercises which created standard data sets for the task. This book gives a
thorough overview of current WSD techniques and performance of systems on these
data sets, as well as a brief history of the field and some truly insightful discussions on
potential developments for the future.
As Hirst points out in the Foreword, the book is a collection of summaries written
by leading experts in the field rather than an anthology of authors’ own work, though
because these are experts there is naturally a good representation of their work. As
well as surveys of existing material, there are analyses which will be of interest even
to those familiar with the WSD literature. The book is an extremely useful resource for
information that has not been collated elsewhere and additionally contains material
that has not been published elsewhere, such as personal communication references and
findings from project reports. There are some excellent discussions on the hot topics
of the field. One primary focus for discussion is the choice of sense inventory for the
tagging. This issue is so fundamental to the WSD community (Hanks 2000; Ide and
Fellbaum 2006) that it permeates many of the chapters and relates also to another hot
topic: the relevance of the task for applications. In the Introduction, the co-editors ob-
serve that although most work strives to provide useful technology from an engineering
perspective, there is also scope in pursuing WSD for gains in theoretical computational
semantics.
The choice of the inventory is the focus for the two chapters that follow the In-
troduction. Chapter 2, by Kilgarriff, looks at the notion of word sense using evidence
collected from his work on the match (or mismatches) between defined senses and
corpus evidence. He argues that although sense inventories might be a useful place
to start, they are constructed under the pragmatic considerations of lexicographers. It
should therefore not be assumed that they have cognitive validity or meet the require-
ments of an NLP system. Kilgarriff looks at the concept of word sense in the context of
Fregean versus Gricean semantics. He argues that the Gricean framework focusing on
the intended usage fits better with the spectrum of contexts of a word than trying to
isolate the truth values of these contexts in a Fregean setting.
Chapter 3, by Ide and Wilks, continues the argument of appropriateness of lexi-
cographer sense distinctions from a practical viewpoint. They argue that we would be
better off abandoning the fine-grained test material that we have been focusing on and
Computational Linguistics Volume 33, Number 2
starting from a coarser-grained level that humans and systems can more reliably dis-
criminate. Once we are closer to 100% accuracy, we can then see if this improves a given
NLP application, rather than the somewhat futile situation we have at present where
system performance is too poor to be sure if WSD is beneficial to an end application.
The issue remains of which word senses to use. Ide and Wilks discuss using evidence
for distinctions from cross-linguistic and psycholinguistic studies or the etymology
distinctions captured by lexicographers as homonyms.
Chapter 4, by Palmer, Ng, and Dang, is essential reading for those needing to
get to grips with the standard evaluation data sets, particularly those created for the
SENSEVAL exercises. They provide thorough descriptions of the procedures involved
in producing the data sets for SENSEVAL-1 and -2 and a brief overview of SENSEVAL-3
(the book was written around the time of the latter). There are details on the range of
tasks in these evaluation exercises, and the core methodology is described specifically
with respect to English. There is a bias towards description of the English all-words
and verbal lexical sample tasks due to the role of the first and third authors in the con-
struction of these resources. The methods for producing the coarse-grained groups that
were used for scoring the SENSEVAL-2 verbs are clearly and succinctly described. The
involvement of Palmer and Dang in the construction of these resources (Palmer, Dang,
and Fellbaum 2007) makes them well qualified to provide a very useful overview of this
valuable work on verb classes. The methods for producing coarse senses for other parts
of speech (PoS) are unfortunately not available in the SENSEVAL-2 literature.
The bulk of the book, Chapters 5–10, is devoted to WSD techniques. As the editors
point out, there is inevitably some overlap. Classification of approaches and division
of the material is not straightforward because topics are very much interleaved and
the field abounds with hybrid systems. Some duplication could perhaps have been
avoided, for example the repetition of factual material on data sets and evaluations,
but the overlap is not significant and some is beneficial because it makes each chapter
self-contained, reinforces important issues, and provides different perspectives on the
same material.
Chapters 5–7 describe WSD methods according to three categories: knowledge-
based, unsupervised, and supervised. In Chapter 5, Mihalcea gives a clear exposition
of methods that use “knowledge” for disambiguation. This knowledge is typically in-
formation coded manually in a given inventory (often WordNet), though the term
“knowledge-based” is also used here and elsewhere for hybrid approaches that use the
predefined information to structure knowledge acquired from corpus data. Heuristics
are included in this chapter, some of which rely on sense-tagged data, so they might
well have been placed with the supervised methods in Chapter 7.
The division between unsupervised and supervised systems in Chapters 6 and 7
captures the difference between systems that distinguish senses according to evidence
from raw data and those that make distinctions according to a predefined inventory.
This is a very important distinction considering the issues with predefined inventories
raised by Kilgarriff. In the WSD community, however, there is ambiguity in the term
unsupervised, which is widely used in the WSD literature, and particularly the SENSEVAL
proceedings, for systems that do not use hand-tagged data (even though they use
predefined senses). The reader is warned of the ambiguity in many places but because
the ambiguity is present in the book from the Introduction, it might have been worth
making this ambiguity explicit from the start. In Chapter 6, Pedersen reserves the
terminology for systems that discover senses automatically from data. So far such work
has focused on sense discovery, with a few exceptions, such as Sch¨utze (1998), who
applied induced senses to the task of disambiguation and information retrieval. The

full potential of these unsupervised systems has yet to be realized because evaluation
on standard data sets necessitates mapping from the induced classes to whichever pre-
defined inventory was used in the creation of the data set (Agirre et al. 2006). When
evaluation can be performed on a task that doesn’t prescribe a particular set of labels,
these methods should benefit from renewed interest.
Chapter 7 is the longest chapter in the book, which reflects the predominance of
work on supervised methods that use both predefined senses and hand-tagged data.
The availability of standard data sets has made systematic comparison possible; how-
ever, such comparison is difficult because so many factors are involved and typically
only a few parameters are considered by any one study. In this respect, Chapters 7
and 8 contain some very useful analysis. In Chapter 7, M´arquez, Escudero, Mart´ınez,
and Rigau provide an experimental comparison of some of the supervised learning
algorithms on the DSO corpus. The results are dependent on the combination of algo-
rithm, features, and evaluation data set and because the differences are small it is hard
to determine definitive winners. The comparison is followed by an excellent section
explaining why systems are hitting ceilings on performance and expanding on some
possibilities that have been advocated for tackling the problems.
In Chapter 8, Agirre and Stevenson categorize the various knowledge sources that
feed into WSD systems, identify these sources in existing WSD systems, and collate find-
ings on the benefits of the various categories from a number of comparative evaluations
in the literature. They provide a useful set of observations on the contribution of the
knowledge sources described in the chapter. Again it is apparent that although there
are general trends to be found—for example that verbs may do better with specific
knowledge sources, such as subcategorization, and discriminative approaches—there
is no “one size fits all” even across a given PoS and the interaction between features
and algorithms makes the exploration difficult. There is plenty of motivation for com-
bining knowledge sources to get optimum results, as no one knowledge source or
algorithm is a panacea; however, work is clearly needed to isolate components and
to determine what works well when. The discussion in Chapter 8 is a useful step in
that direction.
In Chapter 9, Gonzalo and Verdejo examine how knowledge sources needed for
WSD can be acquired automatically. They look at automatic acquisition of topical
knowledge about word senses and also pick up on the thread from the end of Chap-
ter 7 on trying to provide supervised systems with sufficient sense-tagged examples
using cross-lingual resources and information gleaned from the Web. They highlight
research (Agirre and Mart´ınez 2004) demonstrating the importance of determining the
right sampling bias when using Web data. Another approach has been to exploit the
Web community for voluntary labor in annotation tasks. Web directories also show
potential for finding valuable domain-specific information, which is championed in
Chapter 10 as a crucial input for WSD.
Chapter 10 is a practical chapter on the importance of domains, subjects, and
topics. Buitelaar, Magnini, Strapparava, and Vossen ask whether domains are neces-
sary for WSD and whether they are the whole story. The evidence suggests that the
answer is somewhere between these two viewpoints. There is no doubt that for many
words, domain information is important, though the high percentage of “factotum” (i.e.,
domain-independent) words implies it cannot be the whole answer. The importance
of the domain issue depends on the purpose of WSD. If one were using WSD output
for semantic analysis of generic text, then domain issues would not be as significant
compared to a cross-lingual task operating on domain-specific text. The chapter ends

with a series of results demonstrating the potential for domain-specific WSD in various
information retrieval and cross-lingual information retrieval tasks.
The book finishes with a wonderful survey by Resnik on the role of WSD in appli-
cations. If one is making claims about the potential utility of an explicit WSD module,
which most WSD research does, one needs to be aware of the lack of proof for this as-
sumption. Resnik presents the evidence in a very readable summary along with reasons
why the benefits of WSD have yet to be proved. He does, however, argue that we are
right to endeavor to validate our techniques by demonstrating that they have practical
utility, and he speculates on some emerging applications where the WSD technologies
might find a niche.
This book is an excellent overview of a buoyant research area. We are now as
a community looking to broaden our horizons as we look forward to SEMEVAL, the
successor of the SENSEVAL exercises. This collection serves as a thorough record of
where we are now and provides some nice pointers for where we need to go. It is a
great resource containing valuable reference material, helpful summaries of findings,
further-reading sections, and a useful appendix on resources. There is also an index
to many of the authors and algorithms cited in the book, though not all cited systems
actually appear in the index. Even though the book is tailored for those new to the field,
veteran WSD researchers will find the collection makes good reading with plenty of
material and discussions that do not appear elsewhere. I will certainly be dipping into
the book for many years to come.
