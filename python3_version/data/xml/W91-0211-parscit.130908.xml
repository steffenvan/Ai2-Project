Lexical knowledge is knowledge that can be expressed in words. Circular though this may seem,
we think it provides a perfectly reasonable point of departure, for, in line with a long-standing
philosophical tradition it posits communicability as the most characteristic aspect of lexical
knowledge. Knowledge representation systems should be designed so as to fit lexical data rather
than the other way round. A broad view of the possible scope of lexical semantics would thus be
one which tries to chart out the systematic, generalizable aspects of word meanings, and of the
relations between words, drawing on readily accessible sources of lexical knowledge, such as
machine readable dictionaries, encyclopedias, and representative corpora, coupled with the kind of
analytic apparatus that is needed to fruitfully explore such sources, for instance custom-built
parsers to cope with dictionary definitions (Vossen 1990), statistical programs to deal with the
distributional properties of lexical items in large corpora (Church &amp; Hanks 1990) etc. At the same
time this kind of massive data-acquisition should be made sensitive to the borders between
perceptual experience, lexical knowledge and expert knowledge.

Many psychologists are quite content to declare that intelligence is what you measure by means of
an intelligence test. In a somewhat similar way one could say that lexical knowledge is the kind of
knowledge that can be expressed in words. An advantage of this position is that you can turn it
round: knowledge that cannot be expressed in words is not lexical knowledge. A further
advantage is that it automatically relates lexical knowledge to something that lends itself to
intersubjective inspection: linguistic utterances. And yet another advantage is that it tells us how
and where to look for typical expressions of lexical knowledge within the welter of linguistic
utterances. In ever widening concentric circles, we can inspect: general dictionaries as sources of
the lexical knowledge that is associated with the &apos;common core&apos; vocabulary; encyclopedias for
additional knowledge associated with many of the items contained in the dictionaries and for
lexically expressed information about all kinds of facts and events; specialized dictionaries for more
expert knowledge in specific domains; manuals, treatises, newspaper articles, speeches, broadcasts
and so forth for yet more details on anything and everything that humans find worth-while
communicating about.

In this paper we want to defend this point of view by making clear that all knowledge is necessarily
dependent on representation. According to Dik (1986, 1989) this representation takes the form of
either perceptual images or verbal structures (section 2). In section 3, we want to demonstrate that
knowledge encoded in verbal structures is reducible to grammatical elements and lexical items
(grammatical knowledge and lexical knowledge respectively). The insights gained from our work
with machine readable dictionaries (MRDs) the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English,
henceforth LDOCE, and the Van Dale dictionary of contemporary Dutch &amp;quot;Groot Woordenboek van
het Hedendaags Nederlands&amp;quot;, henceforth Van Dale, lead to the conclusion that lexical knowledge
in the end is perceptual (in the form of primitive perceptual images) and grammatical (in the form of
grammatical primitives). This makes all linguistically expressed knowledge ultimatily reducible to
these primitives. Since only linguistic knowledge is communicable, part of all knowledge is thus
private (at least the knowledge corresponding to perceptual images). The structure of lexical
knowledge as it emerges from our work, suggests a view on lexical meaning as not defining the
object a word stands for but as representing a typical (not necessarily unique) conceptualization of
that object (section 4). This hypothesis about lexical knowledge leads to the conclusion (section 5)
that there are differences between lexical knowledge and expert-domain knowledge, in that the
objective of the former is the use of a word as a symbol for a conceptualization of an object, and
the objective of the latter is to have knowledge on (all and any imaginable) properties of the object
itself.

2 The representation of knowledge

Knowledge, of any kind, has to be stored in memory. What is memorizable can be distinguished
in perceptual information and conceptual knowledge. What we perceive is of course influenced by
the concepts we have and, the other way round, concepts are partially based on our perception.
Still there is a clear difference between perceptual information and conceptual representation in that
the former is tied to the capacities of the sensory-apparatus and the latter to cognitive limitations to
process information. In order to reduce the cognitive load of continuously processing and storing
an enormous amount of data, the incoming information from the sensory apparatus is categorized
in terms of more general concepts which as much as possible abstract from irrelevant details. By
storing clusters of perceived features in terms of their conceptual categories all redundant
information can be &apos;forgotten&apos;. This process of categorization has been described by Rosch (1977)
in terms of two contrastive principles:
i. a concept aims at capturing as many features as possible shared by its instantiations; in
other words to be as specific as possible.
a concept aims at capturing as many instances as possible in order to reduce the number of
needed categories; in other words to be as general as possible.
Ideal categories are in balance with regard to both principles, and hence provide the most efficient
unit to store information. The cognitive system will therefore probably represent incoming
information as much as possible in terms of these ideal categories. These conceptual categories
thus constitute the building blocks of accumulating knowledge shaping, and being shaped, by the
ungoing processing of information.
Any abstraction from actual experience, however, implies that there is some kind of
representation system in which the concept is expressed. Without representation knowledge cannot
exist because there is no way to generalize over the individual experiences. The category that
represents all prototypical instances has to be &apos;named&apos; somehow to be able to attach information to
it that applies to all these instances. This dependence of knowledge or &apos;symbolization&apos; has
important consequences. As far as the above perceptual features are concerned there is evidence
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99796">
114
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.988114135135135">
that they are at least stored in terms of so-called prototype images (this also is intended to hold for
perceptions as &amp;quot;smell&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;emotions&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;touch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;taste&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hearing&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;movement&amp;quot;). These are a kind of
mental pictures which can &apos;be seen or experienced&apos; through &apos;the mind&apos;s eye&apos; and from which even
inferences can be drawn (e.g. mental rotation tasks of three-dimensional objects having a two-
dimensional representation, Shepard and Metzler 1977). Not all knowledge, however, deals with
perceptual features and this non-perceptual knowledge is therefore not bound to the perceptual
apparatus of people. Whatever perceptual features are stored by some prototypical image or mental
picture of a &apos;bird&apos;, many of the corresponding concepts, for instance the fact that it is an &apos;animal&apos;
and therefore shares the feature &apos;living&apos; with all other &apos;animals&apos;, cannot be captured by a purely
perceptual image. Having a prototypical image of an &apos;animal&apos; probably does not even make sense
(although there may be a stereotypical best example of it, probably some kind of mammal),
because instances of perceived &apos;animals&apos; are more likely categorized in terms of more specific (and
therefore more informative) categories. Non-perceptual facts, generalizing over individual cases,
have to be represented by some other conceptual language than perceptual images (other examples
of non-perceptual knowledge are e.g. &amp;quot;social status&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;kinship relations&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;capacities&amp;quot;).
Dik (1986, 1989, see also Weigand 1989, Meijs 1989) argues that any representation language for
non-perceptual knowledge, in additi n to perceptual images, must be verbal for the following
reasons:
i. If there is a common conceptual language for all mankind, why are the actual natural
languages so different from each other?
How can we explain the great difficulties in translating if human beings are supposed to
have a common universal conceptual language?
Why should speakers of natural languages have two systems to represent their information,
a universal conceptual language and a natural language, when almost any conceivable
content can be expressed in natural language?
iv. In practice, any actual description of conceptual structures uses words of some specific
natural language. If there is a language independent representation system then what are its
symbols?
Although the symbols of such a knowledge representation are tied to the actual content words of
languages, Dik claims that the representation structure in which the content words are captured is
more abstract than the actual linguistic expressions of any one language. Such a structure should
represent all the functional communicative and compositional aspects of linguistic expressions
while at the same time it should abstract away from all language-dependent details of grammatical
expression that are irrelevant from a conceptual point of view. For instance, the fact that the
expression of information has a passive or active form is irrelevant because it does not affect the
relation between entities designated by the expression. This point is nicely illustrated by the
following two definitions in one and the same dictionary:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.862877">

<bodyText confidence="0.990269625">
a. bray 20 n. the sound that a donkey makes
b. hee-haw 0 1 n. the sound made by a donkey
(Examples from LDOCE, 1978)
Similarly, once the semantic interpretation of function words such as determiners, relative
pronouns, prepositions, and of inflection information has been established in terms of argument
positions, functions and operators in the grammar, these elements can be omitted from the
underlying structure. The following, for instance, is a Functional Grammar representation for both
definitions:

b. [ d, s (xl) : soundN (xl): makev [ 1, s (x2) : donkeyN (x2) lag Obj [ (xl)] GO Subj (xl)]
The structure as a whole designates a term with an entity reference index &amp;quot;x 1 &amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;d&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;s&amp;quot;
before the first occurrence of &amp;quot;xl&amp;quot; stand for term operators expressing definiteness and singularity
respectively. Of &amp;quot;xl&amp;quot; two properties are stated: &amp;quot;donkey&amp;quot; and a complex property between braces.
The complex property consists of an involvement of &amp;quot;xl&amp;quot; (expressed by the co-referentiality) in an
event designated by the main predicate &amp;quot;make&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;xl&amp;quot; fills the second argument slot of both
structures having the semantic function &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot; (Goal), whereas &amp;quot;x2&amp;quot; (classified as a &amp;quot;donkey&amp;quot;) fills
the first argument position of both structures (&amp;quot;i&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; are again term operators, &amp;quot;i&amp;quot; standing for
indefinite), having the semantic function &amp;quot;Ag&amp;quot; (Agent). The only differences between the two
structures are the assigment of the syntactic functions subject and object (&amp;quot;Subj&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Obj&amp;quot;) and the
relative pronoun marker &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;. These differences lead to the two different surface structures, but
they do not affect the semantic interpretation of the structures, which is the same for both.
Note that this view of knowledge allows concepts to be represented by complex structures
containing several word senses. Given the fact that the repertory of expressions in natural language
is theoretically unlimited, there is also no theoretical limitation on the possibility of representing
some concept in the underlying structure.

3 The cyclic nature of linguistically expressed knowledge
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975593608695652">
The advantage of taking a underlying linguistic-conceptual structure, which is claimed to be
universal in Dik&apos;s theory of Functional Grammar (1989), as the format of representation is that it
brings knowledge within the scope of so-called linguistic knowledge: i.e. knowledge is taken to be
stored in verbal form. Any knowledge, even expert knowledge or specialized symbolic systems
such as the &apos;language&apos; of mathematics or logic, has to have some interface with natural language to
make it communicable. To make the same point Weigand (1989) refers to the work of Gardner
(1987), who has studied knowledge representation in the legal domain. She admits that despite the
rather sharply defined technical terms, many items, at some point, have to be grounded in ordinary
language. A law on &apos;dogs&apos; may define the term &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; but it does not define the word &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot; (the
so-called open texture problem; Hart 1961). The only solution is to relate expert or domain
knowledge to general natural language. Once the tools for analyzing natural language in terms of its
semantic content are available it is possible to squeeze knowledge out of any linguistic utterance
regardless of whether it is uttered as expert knowledge, broadcasts, speeches, newspaper articles,
treatises, or in manuals. For any utterance it will hold that its meaning can be explained in terms of
the underlying linguistic-conceptual structure and the meaning of the content words that it contains:
Meaning (expression) = Meaning (underlying linguistic-conceptual structure)
Meaning (words)
This means that expressions of expert knowledge in some natural language are subject to the same
rules and restrictions imposed by the grammar on expressions of the language as a whole. If we
look at the following example of the entry &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; in the Encyclopaedia Brittanica (1977) the
language used to describe the knowledge is ordinary English, e.g.:
water 19:633, a familiar substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and
existing in vapour, liquid, and several solid forms. Water is essential to terrestrial life, participating
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99468">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.985853205128205">
in virtually every process that occurs in plant and animal organisms. Although the molecules of
water are simple in structure, the physical and chemical properties of the compound are
extraordinarily complicated. ... etc....
Many words are familiar and common English words used in their non-expert meanings. The
expert words used, such as &amp;quot;hydrogen&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;oxygen&amp;quot;, can be looked up again, mostly in the same
resource:
hydrogen (from Greek hydro- and genes, &amp;quot;water former&amp;quot;), a colourless, odourless, tasteless,
flammable, gaseous substance, the simplest member of the family of chemical elements; ...
Schematically, all knowledge is thus necessarily related to linguistic knowledge in the following
way:
Meaning (Expert word) = Meaning (Expert expression)
Meaning (Expert expression) = Meaning (underlying linguistic-conceptual structure)
Meaning (Expert words)
Meaning (Ordinary words)
The meaning of the structure is defined in the grammar. This definition takes care of very basic
notions and presuppositions such as &apos;entity&apos;, &apos;event&apos;, &apos;state&apos;, &apos;change of state&apos;, &apos;causality&apos;,
&apos;control&apos;, &apos;location&apos;, &apos;time&apos;, &apos;semantic roles&apos;, &apos;quantification&apos;, &apos;countability&apos;, etc. The rest of the
content is based on the meaning of the ordinary words to be found in the lexicon as lexical
knowledge. Thus, to profit from the wealthy electronic resource of linguistically expressed
knowledge that is accumulating every day, it will be necessary to get a hold on the semantics of
linguistic utterances; that is to develop a grammar and provide a lexicon. After that everything
deserving of the description &apos;knowledge&apos; (except perceptual or picturized knowledge) is fair game
for lexical semantic hunters.
In view of the essential character of knowledge as outlined above, it is not surprising that
lexical knowledge is stored in the form of expressions in natural language as well in dictionaries
(although some dictionaries additionally also use pictures). The same concentric arrangement as
described above can thus be applied to the lexical knowledge contained in dictionaries:
Meaning (Ordinary word) = Meaning (Dictionary Expression)
Meaning (Dictionary Expression) = Meaning (underlying linguistic-conceptual structure)
Meaning (Ordinary words)
The combined explanations and illustrations can thus be thought of as constituting a huge relational
network or grid which must by necessity have a non-trivial correspondence with the knowledge
that is being expressed. Furthermore most explanations follow a canonical format, so the relational
network is also structured to a fairly high degree. The study of machine-readable dictionaries in
the past decade or so has made it possible to trace the relational network inherent in
dictionary-definitions in great detail. While these kind of studies have shown that the inherent
network-organization is naturally far from perfect, they have also brought out that the overall
contours are nevertheless clearly recognizable. When, for instance, this concentric principle is
systematically applied to the genus words of dictionary definitions the words of a language thus

form hierarchical chains like the following examples from LDOCE:
Entry Word Sense Dictionary definition
blue-bell 1 any of various blue bell-shapedflowers
flower 1 the part of a plant, often beautiful and coloured, that produces seeds or fruit
2 a plant that is grown for the beauty of this part
plant 1 a living thing that has leaves and roots, and grows usu. in earth, esp. the
kind smaller than trees
thing 1 any material object
object 1 a thing
The entry words are decomposed via the genus terms in ever more general classes until,
necessarily, a circularity occurs. Such chains, which have been generated for LDOCE nouns and
verbs and Van Dale nouns, tied together form a semantic classification of the vocabulary of a
language in terms of a small set of circularly defined words. At least as far as nouns are concerned
the circular top of this hierarchy can be described in terms of a semantic typology (Vossen fc.).
This means that all nouns finally end up in a few typological primitives (collectives, individuals,
masses), defined in the grammar. This is of course not surprising in a dictionary like LDOCE (the
machine-readable version of which we studied in the LINKS-project), which uses a restricted
controlled vocabulary and starts from the stated aim of explaining the words which the user-learner
may not know in terms of words which he does know. However, our investigation of the Van
Dale Dictionary of Contemporary Dutch in the context of the ESPRIT-project &apos;ACQUILEX&apos; has
shown that the inherent organization of this dictionary shows a broadly similar pattern, and we
have reason to assume that basically the same goes for any good general dictionary (cf eg Amsler
1980).
The relevance of these chains is not so much to get at the typological status of words but to
be able to get at the properties or knowledge specified in the differentiae of the more general words
in these chains, so that they can be inherited for the more specific words. The fact that a &amp;quot;blue-bell&amp;quot;
is &amp;quot;animate&amp;quot;, for instance, is inherited via &amp;quot;flower&amp;quot; from the properties described in the definition
of &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot;. At the highest level in these hierarchies the definitions become rather void and no new
properties are added. At this point lexical knowledge has been dissolved in all the properties
specified by the differentiae along the way, and the semantic primitive at the end_ If we look at the
differentiae then they can basically be divided into stated properties and involvements in events.
The latter facts can be represented in the underlying linguistic-conceptual structure as the fillers of
particular slots of the predicate designating that event (in the above examples second argument of
&amp;quot;produce&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;grow&amp;quot;, first argument of &amp;quot;have&amp;quot;). These slots can have various functions or
roles, all of which are defined in terms of the semantics of the grammar (see section 2 for an
example of the underlying structure). If, on the other hand, we trace down the static properties that
are expressed in the differentiae by looking up their definitions in LDOCE then it appears that they
often designate perceptual features:

The oddity of defining perceptual knowledge in terms of words is apparent from obvious
circularities such as &amp;quot;blue = the colour blue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;colour = red, blue, green, black, brown, yellow,
white, etc&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;round = circular = round&amp;quot; (sic!). These properties at least justify a way of
representing knowledge separate from the lexical means. The verbal representation of this
knowledge can only be seen as a pointer to some non-verbal perceptual image. In the end all
conceptual knowledge is thus reducible to relations between words (contained in a underlying
linguistic-conceptual structure) which can in their turn be related to grammatical primitives and
perceptual images. Figure 1 represents the elaboration of knowledge from elementary primitive
concepts defined in the grammar and perceptual images, to lexical primitives, to all lexical items, to
layman knowledge upto expert knowledge:

The lexical primitives that end up in sensory-motor experiences represented by perceptual images
and grammatical primitives, can be used to describe the higher order concepts designated by the
other words of the lexicon. The vocabulary as a whole together with the grammar provides the
equipment to represent any conceptual content within layman knowledge. Along the same lines,
although more strict and systematic, expert knowledge is in its turn anchored in basic layman
concepts.
Given the fact that only lexical knowledge is communicable, we have to conclude that some
knowledge is private knowledge. This seems to be very reasonable since, although we can talk
quite happily about our visual, auditory and tactile (etc.) experiences, it is ultimately impossible to
actually communicate the essence of this kind of sensory-motor experience by lexical means.
Instead, that requires exchanging the actual experience in some way or other (pointing to a colour,
playing a tune, giving a blow, etc.). When it comes to the crunch, there is a soft centre at the heart
of any kind of lexical definition. That soft centre is &apos;private meaning&apos;. However tight we weave the
web of words, we can never be certain that the concept one language-user associates with a
particular word is exactly the same as that associated with it by another language-user. Dictionary
definitions, of any kind, can thus only be approximative, never exhaustive.

4 The structure of lexical knowledge
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995535">
Since all knowledge, in the end, reduces to relations between words, structural constraints on these
relations entailed by the lexicon are relevant to any kind of knowledge. Each layer of knowledge
elaborates on what is given by the inner area. Given the hypothesis that languages can express
anything, there is no restriction in expressing any piece of knowledge so that the anchoring in
lexical knowledge only leaves room for a very weak version of the Sapir 8c Whorf hypothesis (that
language may influence thought and therefore knowlege). Despite that, we have evidence that the
synchronic results of the diachronic process of knowledge acquisition and lexicalization illustrate
that there tendencies have played a role in the development of knowledge between lexical and

expert knowledge. In a series of projects at the Univerisity of Amsterdam (ASCOT, LINKS) the
syntactic and semantic information in LDOCE (and more recently in the framework of the Esprit
project Acquilex, also the information contained in the Van Dale dictionaries of Contemporary
Dutch) has been analysed and parsed (Akkerman e.a. 1988, Vossen 1990), and subsequently
stored in a database, so that it is now possible to have systematic access to this knowledge. From
studying the classificational structures (see previous section) that arise from it on a large scale and
cross-linguistically (Vossen 1991, Vossen fc.) several conclusions on the structure of lexical
knowledge can be drawn. The main point to be made is that the way in which words are classified
can vary, as illustrated in figure 2, in which some of the relations at the top of the noun-hierarchy
from LDOCE are given:

Not all &apos;substances&apos; are also found below &amp;quot;substance&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;soap&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;spice&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;curry-powder&amp;quot; are
classified as &apos;products&apos; instead. A similar thing holds for &amp;quot;skin&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;flesh&amp;quot; which are primarily
not defined as &apos;bodypare but as &amp;quot;covering&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;substance&amp;quot; respectively. As for &apos;foods&apos; what is
&apos;eatable&apos; is also stored as &amp;quot;fruit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;vegetable&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;liquid&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;flesh&amp;quot;, or directly as &amp;quot;substance&amp;quot; , which
do not directly relate to the node &amp;quot;food&amp;quot;. These differences in classifying words via their definition
can be mainly traced back to two different modes of defining in dictionaries. Either the
involvement of the designated object in some event is stressed, resulting in classes such as &amp;quot;food&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;covering&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; (in most cases of concrete non-animate objects its function), or a
constitutional view is taken, as is the case with genus terms such as &amp;quot;substance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;liquid&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;PART-
OF body&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot; ,&amp;quot;fruit&amp;quot;, etc..
If we compare the classifications in LDOCE with their equivalents (equivalent according to
the bilingual Dutch-English dictionary of Van Dale) in the hierarchy based on the Van Dale
definitions, then these differences become even more striking. Many English words that are
defined as some &amp;quot;substance&amp;quot; in LDOCE (e.g. &amp;quot;chocolate&amp;quot;) have equivalent counterparts in Dutch
(e.g. &amp;quot;chocolade&amp;quot;) which are primarily defined in terms of their function (&amp;quot;genotmiddel&amp;quot; best
translatable as &amp;quot;means of enjoying by ingesting&amp;quot;). The word &amp;quot;midclel&amp;quot; (equivalent to English

words such as &amp;quot;mnemonics&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;access&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;approach&amp;quot; (the total number of word-senses related to it is
31, whereas thousands of senses are related to the Dutch &amp;quot;midden, and the kind of compounds
which naturally lead to &amp;quot;middel&amp;quot; in Dutch do not exist in English. Instead of that English has
different words that do not so ostensibly lead to a functional classification. Figure 3 illustrates the
difference between the two hierarchies:

Although both languages are culturally and historically closely related, large parts of the Dutch and
English hierarchies differ considerably because the lexicographer&apos;s equipment to describe the
concepts - i.e. the vocabularies of the two languages and hence the conceptualizations enforced
by them - differ in crucial respects. The Dutch lexicographers have probably been triggered by the
&amp;quot;middel&amp;quot; compounds to relate them to the functional node &amp;quot;midden English lexicographers, on the
other hand, were faced with words (such as &amp;quot;vehicle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;substance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;medicine&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;food&amp;quot;) that do
not evoke &amp;quot;means&amp;quot; as a word for classification.
There are two ways of dealing with this variation in defining. Either the lexicographers have been
inconsistent and one way of defining should be preferred over the other (although this may be
more difficult to formulate in some cases than in others), or the work of lexicographers, in
principle, is to be taken seriously and the fact that these words are differently classified is
meaningful (in practice, examples of both interpretations can be found). The latter view is most
relevant for our discussion because it implies that lexical meaning is not always the same as
equivalence according to a bilingual dictionary. Although Dutch &amp;quot;chocolade&amp;quot; and English
&amp;quot;chocolate&amp;quot; are equivalent translation pairs, they still have different lexical meanings. For
translation purposes, substitution of words in all contexts is a sufficient criterion. Words,
however, can have the same referential meaning but still stand for different concepts (Frege&apos;s Sinn
und Bedeutung). In this view the lexical meaning as described in dictionary definitions would be
taken to stand for a particular conceptualization of a possible set of referents, whereas that same set
of referents can also be conceptualized in many other ways. In this sense dictionary definitions do
not &apos;define&apos; the object of reference, that is give the list of properties that uniquely discriminate it
from all other objects, but merely tell you that using this word means that you have to look at the

<bodyText confidence="0.7464595">
object from this perspective (conceptualize it in such and such way). Within such a view of lexical
meaning, variation in classification as in the follwing examples makes sense:
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9523946">
armour strong protective covering on fighting vehicles,...
blanket a thick, esp. woollen covering...
carpet heavy woven often woollen material for covering floors or stairs
daub (a) soft sticky material for covering surfaces like walls
(Examples from LDOCE, 1978)
When using the word &amp;quot;blanket&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;armour&amp;quot; to refer to some object you are told to look at it
primarily as a &amp;quot;covering&amp;quot; and secondarily as some kind of &amp;quot;material&amp;quot;, whereas &amp;quot;carpet&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;daub&amp;quot;, as defined here, stress the constitution of the object instead of its function &amp;quot;covering&amp;quot;.
5 Different objectives of lexical and expert-domain knowledge
The view on general lexical knowledge developed above makes it to a certain degree different from
other types of knowledge. Expert knowledge, and to some extent also part of the layman
knowledge deals with knowledge about the object, whereas in case of general lexical knowledge
not knowledge about the object but knowing that a particular word stands for a particular
conceptualization (that can be used to refer to a corresponding object) is the goal. This perfectly fits
in with the lexicographer&apos;s tradition of describing the semantic properties of words, in which the
&apos;use of words&apos; has always prevailed and not the knowledge about the object. A word as such is no
more than a vehicle of information within a particular context This does not necessarily imply that
the &apos;meaning of a word&apos; (the information it carries over) equals all the knowledge people have on
the object or class of objects that is designated by that word, as is obvious (at least since Galileo)
from the following examples:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.525135" genericHeader="method">
Entry Word Dictionary Definition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9737423125">
sunrise the time when the sun is seen to appear after the night
sunset the time when the sun is seen to disappear as night begins
(Examples from LDOCE, 1978)
sunrise the apparent rising of the sun above the horizon
sunset the apparent descent of the sun below the horizon
(Examples from Webster, 1974)
zonsopgang opgaan van de zon
(sunrise) (rising-above of the sun)
zonsondergang het ondergaan van de zon
(sunset) (the descending-below of the sun)
(Examples from Van Dale, 1984)
The words &amp;quot;sunrise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sunset&amp;quot; will probably be used in collocations that trigger the
conceptualization associated with the words and not the knowledge we have about &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;planets&amp;quot; and their &amp;quot;orbits&amp;quot;. Exactly these collocations form the material for lexicographers to
extract the lexical meanings of words.
Furthermore, words not only give different conceptualizations of the same object but can
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996535">
123
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.979195">
also function as a vehicle of attitudinal and social information, as in the following synonymous
variants found in LDOCE on the basis of similar definitions:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.41817325">
Entry Word Dictionary Definition
bobby infml BrE a policeman (Examples from LDOCE, 1978)
bull sl, esp. AmE a policeman
copper infml a policeman
flatfoot .0 a policeman
peeler BrE old sl a policeman
pig si policeman
cop infml policeman
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999117346153846">
All these words designate the same set of potential referents, but they all carry a different attitudinal
or social signal along expressed by the labels &amp;quot;infml&amp;quot; (=informal), &amp;quot;s1&amp;quot; (=slang), &amp;quot;AmE&amp;quot;
(=American English), &amp;quot;BrE&amp;quot; ( Brittish English), &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; (:•bselete), which tell us in what kind of
context the words can be found (or used) but which has little to do with the &apos;knowledge we have of
policemen&apos;.
As a consequence of these different objectives of lexical and expert-domain knowledge, the
connection between the different layers of knowledge, as represented in figure 1, is not allways
that smooth. For some domains in which the process of lexicalization has clearly been triggered by
the straightforward acquisition of knowledge through science and education, such as animal and
plant names, there may be a rather regular connection between lexical, layman and expert
knowledge in which more and more detailed information is added. As such part of the expert
knowledge has become general lexical knowledge as well over time (perhaps a process in parallel
to that of &amp;quot;Gesunkenes Kulturgut&amp;quot;). However in many domains, and even in animal and plant
names (e.g. compare the functional &amp;quot;watchdog&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sheepdog&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pet&amp;quot; with the different species of
animal in terms of their constitution), other conceptualizations of objects cross-classify with e.g.
expert knowledge. Lexical knowledge thus gives you a wider range of views than expert
knowledge. Something in the external world can be looked upon from all kinds of perspectives
correlating with different words. For instance, while in Dutch we can use either &amp;quot;theewater&amp;quot;
(literally &amp;quot;tea water&amp;quot;) or &amp;quot;koffiewater&amp;quot; (literally &amp;quot;coffee water&amp;quot;) to refer to the water that we are
putting on to boil depending on its intended use, it would still be H20 to the expert. Although the
expert&apos;s knowledge of &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; is more specific, the linguistic equipment to refer to &amp;quot;water&amp;quot;
illustrates a greater variation in possible perspectives. In this sense, expert knowledge can be seen
as more detailed and systematic subtype of lexical knowledge from a more restricted perspective.
Where we expect that expert knowledge is exhaustive and defining, lexical knowledge thus is
typical and associative but hardly ever exhaustive. Only those properties are described which
typically mark the conceptualization that is associated with it.

Circular though this may seem, we think it provides a perfectly reasonable point of departure, for, in line with a long-standing philosophical tradition it posits communicability as the most characteristic aspect of lexical knowledge. Knowledge representation systems should be designed so as to fit lexical data rather than the other way round. A broad view of the possible scope of lexical semantics would thus be one which tries to chart out the systematic, generalizable aspects of word meanings, and of the relations between words, drawing on readily accessible sources of lexical knowledge, such as machine readable dictionaries, encyclopedias, and representative corpora, coupled with the kind of analytic apparatus that is needed to fruitfully explore such sources, for instance custom-built parsers to cope with dictionary definitions (Vossen 1990), statistical programs to deal with the distributional properties of lexical items in large corpora (Church &amp; Hanks 1990) etc. At the same time this kind of massive data-acquisition should be made sensitive to the borders between perceptual experience, lexical knowledge and expert knowledge.</abstract>

According to Dik (1986, 1989) this representation takes the form of either perceptual images or verbal structures (section 2). In section 3, we want to demonstrate that knowledge encoded in verbal structures is reducible to grammatical elements and lexical items (grammatical knowledge and lexical knowledge respectively). The insights gained from our work with machine readable dictionaries (MRDs) the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, henceforth LDOCE, and the Van Dale dictionary of contemporary Dutch &amp;quot;Groot Woordenboek van het Hedendaags Nederlands&amp;quot;, henceforth Van Dale, lead to the conclusion that lexical</context>

Having a prototypical image of an &apos;animal&apos; probably does not even make sense (although there may be a stereotypical best example of it, probably some kind of mammal), because instances of perceived &apos;animals&apos; are more likely categorized in terms of more specific (and therefore more informative) categories. Non-perceptual facts, generalizing over individual cases, have to be represented by some other conceptual language than perceptual images (other examples of non-perceptual knowledge are e.g. &amp;quot;social status&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;kinship relations&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;capacities&amp;quot;). Dik (1986, 1989, see also Weigand 1989, Meijs 1989) argues that any representation language for non-perceptual knowledge, in additi n to perceptual images, must be verbal for the following reasons: i. If there is a common conceptual language for all mankind, why are the actual natural languages so different from each other? How can we explain the great difficulties in translating if human beings are supposed to have a common universal conceptual language? Why should speakers of natural languages have two systems to represent their information, a universal conceptual language and a natural language, whe</context>

The only solution is to relate expert or domain knowledge to general natural language. Once the tools for analyzing natural language in terms of its semantic content are available it is possible to squeeze knowledge out of any linguistic utterance regardless of whether it is uttered as expert knowledge, broadcasts, speeches, newspaper articles, treatises, or in manuals. For any utterance it will hold that its meaning can be explained in terms of the underlying linguistic-conceptual structure and the meaning of the content words that it contains: Meaning (expression) = Meaning (underlying lin</context>

Non-perceptual facts, generalizing over individual cases, have to be represented by some other conceptual language than perceptual images (other examples of non-perceptual knowledge are e.g. &amp;quot;social status&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;kinship relations&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;capacities&amp;quot;).
