The Second European Conference and General Meet-
ing of the European Chapter of the ACL will be held
28-29 March 1985 at the University of Geneva, Gene-
va, Switzerland. Papers are being solicited on linguis-
tically and computationally significant topics, including
but not limited to the following:

<listItem confidence="0.999933615384615">
• syntax, parsing, and language generation
• computational semantics
• discourse analysis
• speech analysis and synthesis
• machine translation and machine-aided translation
• automated dictionaries and lexical databases
• mathematical and theoretical foundations of compu-
tational linguistics
• linguistic theories and their computational applica-
tions
• software tools and programming languages for com-
putational linguistics
• representation of knowledge
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.822222666666667">
Authors wishing to present a paper should submit
four copies of a 5 to 8 page summary, double spaced,
by 31 August 1984 to:

It is important that the summary identify the new ideas
and clearly indicate to what extent the work is com-
plete and to what extent it has been implemented. It
should contain sufficient information to allow the pro-
gramme committee to determine the scope of the work
and its relation to relevant literature.
All submissions will be read by the programme
committee, which is chaired by Margaret King, and
will be submitted to a panel of referees. Authors will
be notified of the acceptance of their papers by 30
November 1984. It is likely that a full proceedings
will be published after the conference.

Special Issue on Machine Translation

<bodyText confidence="0.999570928571429">
Papers are solicited for a special issue of Computa-
tional Linguistics that is being planned around the
theme &amp;quot;Machine Translation.&amp;quot; Of interest are thor-
oughgoing discussions of the techniques (both compu-
tational and linguistic) that are being used in existing
large-scale MT systems intended for practical use, and
(relatively) objective evidence concerning the
merits/demerits of such techniques in practice (as
opposed to &amp;quot;in theory&amp;quot;). The issue will highlight re-
cent progress in machine translation, and in computa-
tional linguistics via the evaluation in practical settings
of alternative techniques.
Those interested should send papers as soon as possi-
ble to

publication date is envisioned.
