<bodyText confidence="0.999983517857143">
The synergy between language sciences and lan-
guage technology has been an elusive one for the
computational linguistics community, especially
when dealing with a language other than English.
The reasons are two-fold: the lack of an accessi-
ble comprehensive and robust account of a specific
language so as to allow strategic linking between a
processing task to linguistic devices, and the lack
of successful computational studies taking advan-
tage of such links. With a fast growing number
of available online resources, as well as a rapidly
increasing number of members of the CL commu-
nity who are interested in and/or working on Chi-
nese language processing, the time is ripe to take
a serious look at how knowledge of Chinese can
help Chinese language processing.
The tutorial will be organized according to the
structure of linguistic knowledge of Chinese, start-
ing from the basic building block to the use of Chi-
nese in context. The first part deals with characters
as the basic linguistic unit of Chinese in terms of
phonology, orthography, and basic concepts. An
ontological view of how the Chinese writing sys-
tem organizes meaningful content as well as how
this onomasiological decision affects Chinese text
processing will also be discussed. The second
part deals with words and presents basic issues in-
volving the definition and identification of words
in Chinese, especially given the lack of conven-
tional marks of word boundaries. The third part
deals with parts of speech and focuses on def-
inition of a few grammatical categories specific
to Chinese, as well as distributional properties of
Chinese PoS and tagging systems. The fourth
part deals with sentence and structure, focusing on
how to identify grammatical relations in Chinese
as well as a few Chinese-specific constructions.
The fifth part deals with how meanings are rep-
resented and expressed, especially how different
linguistic devices (from lexical choice to informa-
tion structure) are used to convey different infor-
mation. Lastly, the sixth part deals with the ranges
of different varieties of Chinese in the world and
the computational approaches to detect and differ-
entiate these varieties. In each topic, an empiri-
cal foundation of linguistics facts are clearly expli-
cated with a robust generalization, and the linguis-
tic generalization is then accounted for in terms of
its function in the knowledge representation sys-
tem. Lastly this knowledge representation role is
then exploited in terms of the aims of specific lan-
guage technology tasks. In terms of references,
in addition to language resources and various rel-
evant papers, the tutorial will make reference to
Huang and Shi’s (2016) reference grammar for a
linguistic description of Chinese.

characters, 2) words, 3) Parts of Speech, 4) Sen-
tence and Structure, 5) Meaning: Representation
and Expressive, and 6) Variations and Changes.
Under each knowledge component, there will be
3 to 5 focus areas. In addition, relevant resources
and language technology applications will be in-
troduced together with the linguistic description
or at the end of the lecture sections (for those lan-
guage processing applications involving more than
one linguistic issue.) Overall, two lecture sections
of 80 minutes each will be given, each contain-
ing 5 topical groups (each topical group covers
2-3 focus areas described above). It is estimated
that each topic group will take about 15 minutes to
cover. Although the 15 minutes will not be enough
for explication of finer details, participants will be
able to access and acquire additional details from
a comprehensive list references.
The three hour teaching plan is given below.
