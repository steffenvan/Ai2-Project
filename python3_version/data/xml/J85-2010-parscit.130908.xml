to be held in conjunction with the preceding meeting
This Conference is a sequel to a meeting held in Laxen-
burg, Austria, on the same topic. Among its participants
were: Margaret Boden, Ron Brachman, Stefano Cern,
Nils Nilsson, Peter Raulefs, Tibor Vamos. Its
proceedings, Impacts of Artificial Intelligence: Scientific,
Technological, Military, Economic, Societal, Cultural, and
Political, [R. Trappl, Ed.; North Holland, Amsterdam
and New York, 19851 will form the basis of this Confer-
ence.
The aim of this Conference is to help determine and
assess future developments and impacts of Al in order to
avoid potential damage and to encourage socially helpful
and economically useful Al research and applications. It
is addressed to
— the concerned Al researcher,
— the decision-maker in private companies, government,
and funding institutions, and
— everybody who wants to know more about the poten-
tial risks and benefits of Al for her/his life.
This Special Conference will consist of presentations
by invited speakers, notably leading Al researchers;
contributed papers; panels; and general discussions.
The Proceedings of the Special Conference will be
published separately and should include highlights from
the discussions. They may be ordered at the Conference.
This Special Conference is supported by the Interna-
tional Federation for Systems Research (IFSR).
PAPERS: Colleagues who wish to contribute papers to the
Special Conference are asked to follow the same rules as
given for the Eighth European Meeting on Cybernetics
and Systems Research (see above).

The goal of the annual conference of the Cognitive
Science Society is to provide a forum for the presentation
of interdisciplinary scientific results in the various disci-
plines that comprise Cognitive Science, including Cogni-
tive Psychology, Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics,
Neurobiology, and Philosophy. The 1985 conference is
jointly sponsored by the Cognitive Science Society, the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Biological Sciences
Division of the Office of Naval Research. The confer-
ence will be held immediately preceding the International
Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), which
