2 Contents and structure of the
dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978899">
In November 2002, the Slovenian-German-
Slovenian online dictionary contained more than
4,800 entries which correspond to words, selected
&apos;http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/a_beseda.html
word forms and expressions appearing in the text-
book Odkrivajmo slovenkino, a beginners&apos; text-
book for Slovenian (C&apos; uk et al., 1996). The entire
content of the textbook is covered.
The textbook is used in teaching Slovenian es-
pecially in German, French or Italian speaking
communities.2 It contains Slovenian-only text, ex-
planations and exercises. As there is neither an in-
dex nor a vocabulary list, the online dictionary is
a valuable completion of this educational material.
However, it can be — and actually is — used inde-
pendently of the textbook.
The current version of the online dictionary
contains the following elements, based on Odkri-
vajmo slovenkino:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994095571428572">
• all lemmas appearing in the texts, explana-
tions, instructions and exercises;
• irregular inflected forms as well as the first

• common conversational phrases and multi-
word expressions as well as some contextual
examples of words and grammatical forms.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9928584">
Grammar information for both languages and
information on stressed syllables for the Slovenian
entries are contained in additional fields. For both
languages, three different kinds of search are pos-
sible:

3 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957608695652">
The evaluations of the Slovenian part of the dic-
tionary concern its coverage of a) the corpus of
the Slovenian newspaper DELO, as included in the
ZRC SAZU corpus by the end of November 2002
(cf. Subsection 3.1); b) user queries to the dictio-
nary which have been logged since the publication
of the first trial version in April 2002 (cf. Subsec-
tion 3.2). Based on these analyses, some qual-
itative remarks about the most frequent missing
items will be made (cf. Subsection 3.3).
The evaluation is based on the Slovenian part
of the complete &amp;quot;vocabulary&amp;quot; (words, inflected
forms, expressions) of the dictionary. The 4,841
entries actually contain 4,354 distinct Slovenian
entries; this number is smaller than the overall
number because some words are polysemous, or
some expressions can have different translations.
The minimum number of Slovenian lemmas in the
dictionary can be approximated by counting those
entries which either contain no space in both lan-
guages, or which are reflexive verbs (ending on
&amp;quot;_se&amp;quot; in Slovenian or starting with &amp;quot;sich_&amp;quot; in Ger-
man): There are 2,428 such entries.

<bodyText confidence="0.999891">
To evaluate the coverage of texts by the Slove-
nian side of the dictionary, we chose the wordform
list with frequencies of DELO, the main Slove-
nian daily, from January 1998 to August 2002.

achieve matching of characters which might be difficult to

<bodyText confidence="0.999739970588235">
About 75% of the text of the Monday—Saturday
edition is sent in ASCII format every day via e-
mail to a small list of handicapped (&amp;quot;DELO for
the blind&amp;quot;) and to research users (Nova beseda).
DELO is a good source for modern Slovenian, the
text is spell-checked and proof-read, the error-rate
is low (Jakopin, 2002). The results of our evalu-
ation will give an approximation of how well the
lexical knowledge represented in the dictionary —
which can be interpreted as that of a learner after
finishing the study of the textbook — overlaps with
the lexical content of newspaper text.
The word list of the DELO newspaper corpus
at ZRC SAZU in its November 2002 version con-
tains 930,977 distinct word forms with an overall
occurence of 73,412,302. Using the Corpus Lab-
oratory lemmatizer4 (Jakopin, 2002), the 30,000
most frequent word forms (with an overall occur-
rence of 64,465,582 and a coverage of 87.8% of
the whole corpus) were lemmatized. 25,598 out of
these 30,000 word forms were recognized by the
lemmatizer. The recognized word forms, which
cover 82.8% of the entire DELO corpus (cf. Table
1), will serve as the basis of our evaluation.
Word forms of each single lemma that corre-
sponds to an entry in the dictionary will be counted
as covered. For ambiguous word forms, the proce-
dure is more complicated: In this case the lemma-
tizer output will consist of a set of possible lem-
mas (cf. Table 2). As only a part of the corpus is
POS-tagged (Jakopin and Bizjak, 1997), these sets
cannot be disambiguated. We decided to evaluate
them by marking with an asterisk all those lem-
mas that are not covered by the dictionary; if at

least one of the alternative lemmas is unmarked,
the underlying word form will be counted as cov-
ered. Tables 3 and 4 show parts of the sorted result
of the marking procedure.
Inflected forms of lemmas that appear in Table
3 are counted as covered by the dictionary. For
example, all occurrences of avta, avtom and avtu
will be counted as covered because the lemma avto
(&apos;car&apos;) is in the dictionary, even if the alternative
lemma avt (&apos;oe, in sports contexts) is missing.
We believe that this method is a good approxi-
mation of how much a dictionary user can under-
stand of the lexical content of the newspaper text.
In the case of non-related lemmas, one of them
is usually much more frequent (as with avto and
avt), whereas in the case of related lemmas, the
meaning of the missing one can be inferred from
the other (as with bogat &apos;rich&apos; and bogatiti &apos;to en-
rich&apos;: only bogat corresponds to an entry). Table
4 shows some lemmas and lemma sets which are
not covered by the dictionary.
By this method, we find that 68.3% of the words
in the lemmatized list from the corpus are cov-
ered (for detailed results, cf. Table 5). We no-
tice, however, that not all lemmas in the dictio-
nary (which were approximated to 2,428 lemmas)
are actually among the most frequent ones of the
corpus; for example, the textbook lemmas kozolec

3.2 Query coverage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960631578947">
By 15 November 2002, the trial version of the dic-
tionary logged more than 34,000 requests. For
evaluating the coverage of user queries, we com-
pare the dictionary entries to the log file containing
the 14,030 requests asking for a translation from
Slovenian into German. The results for all queries
as well as for the 100 most popular queries are
shown in Table 6.
As can be seen from the table, the coverage of
all queries is quite low (26.8% overall coverage
and 14.6% coverage of distinct queries). This is
due to the fact that the dictionary contains gen-
eral basic words and expressions; user queries,
however, range from basic to specialised vocab-
ulary and include all sorts of expressions, spelling
mistakes and even queries in languages other than
Slovenian. If we look at the top 100 queries, how-
ever, the results are much better: 74.0% of all
queries and 69.5% of distinct queries are covered.

quired from the corpus analysis and from the user
requests, hardly overlap. The results show that
in order to enhance corpus coverage, the insertion
of seven frequent closed class items (prepositions,
particles and conjunctions, which cover 343,826
occurrences, cf. Table 7), is as important as the
insertion of the top seven missing nouns, which
cover 351,323 occurrences. In contrast to these
findings, user queries mainly concern open class
items: Only two of the top 30 missing lemmas
from the query evaluation are neither verbs nor
nouns. For details on the distinction between open
and closed word classes, cf. Greenbaum (1996).
The politico-economical context of the newspa-
per is reflected by nouns like predsednik &apos;chair-
man&apos;, zakon &apos;law&apos;, minister &apos;minister&apos; and pod-
jetje &apos;company&apos;, which are among the most fre-
quent missing ones. Out of these, only zakon is
also among the 30 most popular and unmatched
user queries. An analysis of the unmatched user
queries shows popular missing lemmas in the
general domain, like pozdrav &apos;greeting; regards&apos;,
postaja &apos;station&apos;, krava &apos;cow&apos; and odpad &apos;waste;
rubbish&apos;. Economical or legal terms of daily life
are popular as well: pogodba &apos;contract&apos;, potrditi
&apos;to confirm&apos;, rae&apos;un &apos;bill&apos; and davek &apos;tax&apos; can be
mentioned as missing from the dictionary.

4 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953636363636">
Using an approximated method of untagged cor-
pus coverage evaluation, we found that a dictio-
nary of general Slovenian based on a beginners&apos;
textbook covers nearly 70% of the 82.8% most fre-
quent lemmatized words in a big newspaper cor-
pus. The textbook also contains lemmas which are
less frequent in the corpus. A comparison of the
corpus evaluation results with an analysis of the
most popular user queries shows differences in the
distribution of word classes among the most fre-
quent unmatched items. Corpus coverage can be
quickly enhanced by the insertion of some closed
class items, while dictionary users are more inter-
ested in open class items.
The dictionary will be enlarged based on these
quantitative and qualitative corpus and query
analyses. Using a tagset covering the grammar
information necessary for the Slovenian language
(cf. e.g. http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/cgi/ckb_oo.html,
(Jakopin and Bizjak, 1997)), the grammar infor-
mation about Slovenian lemmas and word forms
will be completed.

Corpus coverage can be quickly enhanced by the insertion of some closed class items, while dictionary users are more interested in open class items. The dictionary will be enlarged based on these quantitative and qualitative corpus and query analyses. Using a tagset covering the grammar information necessary for the Slovenian language (cf. e.g. http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/cgi/ckb_oo.html, (Jakopin and Bizjak, 1997)), the grammar information about Slovenian lemmas and word forms will be completed.

About 75% of the text of the Monday—Saturday edition is sent in ASCII format every day via email to a small list of handicapped (&amp;quot;DELO for the blind&amp;quot;) and to research users (Nova beseda). DELO is a good source for modern Slovenian, the text is spell-checked and proof-read, the error-rate is low (Jakopin, 2002). The results of our evaluation will give an approximation of how well the lexical knowledge represented in the dictionary — which can be interpreted as that of a learner after finishing the study of the textbook — overlaps with the lexical content of newspaper text. The word list of the DELO newspaper corpus at ZRC SAZU in its November 2002 version contains 930,977 distinct word forms with an overall occurence of 73,412,302.
