<bodyText confidence="0.999974411764706">
The goal of this research is to build a
model to predict stock price movement us-
ing sentiments on social media. A new
feature which captures topics and their
sentiments simultaneously is introduced in
the prediction model. In addition, a new
topic model TSLDA is proposed to obtain
this feature. Our method outperformed
a model using only historical prices by
about 6.07% in accuracy. Furthermore,
when comparing to other sentiment anal-
ysis methods, the accuracy of our method
was also better than LDA and JST based
methods by 6.43% and 6.07%. The results
show that incorporation of the sentiment
information from social media can help to
improve the stock prediction.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999569340425532">
Stock price forecasting is very important in the
planning of business activity. However, building
an accurate stock prediction model is still a chal-
lenging problem. In addition to historical prices,
the current stock market is affected by the mood
of society. The overall social mood with respect
to a given company might be one of the important
variables which affect the stock price of that com-
pany. Nowadays, the emergence of online social
networks makes large amounts of mood data avail-
able. Therefore, incorporating information from
social media with the historical prices can improve
the predictive ability of the models.
The goal of our research is to develop a model to
predict a stock price movement using information
from social media (Message Board). In our pro-
posed method, the model predicts the movement
of the stock value at t using features derived from
information at t − 1 and t − 2, where t stands for
a transaction date. It will be trained by supervised
machine learning. Apart from the mood informa-
tion, the stock prices are affected by many factors
such as microeconomic and macroeconomic fac-
tors. However, this research only focuses on how
the mood information from social media can be
used to predict the stock price movement. That
is, the mood of topics in social media is extracted
by sentiment analysis. Then, the topics and their
sentiments are integrated into the model to pre-
dict the stocks. To achieve this goal, discover-
ing the topics and sentiments in a large amount
of social media is important to get opinions of
investors as well as events of companies. How-
ever, sentiment analysis on social media is diffi-
cult. The text is usually short, contains many mis-
spellings, uncommon grammar constructions and
so on. In addition, the literature shows conflict-
ing results in sentiment analysis for stock market
prediction. Some researchers report that the senti-
ments from social media have no predictive capa-
bilities (Antweiler and Frank, 2004; Tumarkin and
Whitelaw, 2001), while other researchers have re-
ported either weak or strong predictive capabilities
(Bollen et al., 2011). Therefore, how to use opin-
ions in social media for stock price predictions is
still an open problem.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:

Stock market prediction is one of the most at-
tracted topics in academic as well as real life busi-
ness. Many researches have tried to address the
question whether the stock market can be pre-
dicted. Some of the researches were based on
the random walk theory and the Efficient Market
Hypothesis (EMH). According to the EMH (Fama
et al., 1969; Fama, 1991), the current stock mar-
ket fully reflects all available information. Hence,
price changes are merely due to new information
or news. Because news in nature happens ran-
domly and is unknowable in the present, stock
prices should follow a random walk pattern and
the best bet for the next price is the current price.
Therefore, they are not predictable with more than
about 50% accuracy (Walczak, 2001). On the
other hand, various researches specify that the
stock market prices do not follow a random walk,
and can be predicted in some degree (Bollen et al.,
2011; Qian and Rasheed, 2007; Vu et al., 2012).
Degrees of accuracy at 56% hit rate in the pre-
dictions are often reported as satisfying results for
stock predictions (Schumaker and Chen, 2009b; Si
et al., 2013; Tsibouris and Zeidenberg, 1995).
Besides the efficient market hypothesis and the
random walk theories, there are two distinct trad-
ing philosophies for stock market prediction: fun-
damental analysis and technical analysis. The fun-
damental analysis studies the company’s financial
conditions, operations, macroeconomic indicators
to predict the stock price. On the other hand, the
technical analysis depends on historical and time-
series prices. Price moves in trends, and history
tends to repeat itself. Some researches have tried
to use only historical prices to predict the stock
price (Zuo and Kita, 2012a; Zuo and Kita, 2012b).
To discover the pattern in the data, they used
Bayesian network (Zuo and Kita, 2012a; Zuo and
Kita, 2012b), time-series method such as Auto Re-
gressive, Moving Average, Auto Regressive Mov-
ing Average model (Zuo and Kita, 2012a) and so
on.

2.1 Extracting Opinions from Text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963102564102">
Sentiment analysis has been found to play a sig-
nificant role in many applications such as prod-
uct and restaurant reviews (Liu and Zhang, 2012;
Pang and Lee, 2008). There are some researches
trying to apply sentiment analysis on information
sources to improve the stock prediction model.
There are two main such sources. In the past, the
main source was the news (Schumaker and Chen,
2009a; Schumaker and Chen, 2009b), and in re-
cent years, social media sources. A simple ap-
proach is combining the sentiments in the textual
content with the historical prices through the lin-
ear regression model.
Most of the previous work primarily used the
bag-of-words as text representation that are incor-
porated into the prediction model. Schumaker and
Chen tried to use different textual representations
such as bag-of-words, noun phrases and named
entities for financial news (Schumaker and Chen,
2009b). However, the textual representations are
just the words or named entity tags, not exploit-
ing the mood information so much. A novel tree
representation based on semantic frame parsers is
proposed (Xie et al., 2013). By using stock prices
from Yahoo Finance, they annotated all the news
in a transaction date with going up or down cate-
gories. However, the weakness of this assumption
is that all the news in one day will have the same
category. In addition, this is a task of text classifi-
cation, not stock prediction.
Naive Bayes was used to classify messages
from message boards into three classes: buy, hold
and sell (Antweiler and Frank, 2004). They were
integrated into the regression model. However,
they concluded that their model does not success-
fully predict stock returns.
A method to measure collective hope and fear
on each day and analyze the correlation between
these indices and the stock market indicators was
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999890086956522">
proposed (Zhang et al., 2011). They used the
mood words to tag each tweet as fear, worry, hope
and so on. They concluded that the ratio of the
emotional tweets significantly negatively corre-
lated with Down Jones, NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500,
but positively with VIX. However, they did not use
their model to predict the stock price values.
Two mood tracking tools, OpinionFinder and
Google Profile of Mood States, were used to an-
alyze the text content of daily Twitter (Bollen et
al., 2011). The former measures the positive and
negative mood. The latter measures the mood in
terms of six dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital,
Kind, and Happy). They used the Self Organizing
Fuzzy Neural Network model to predict DJIA val-
ues. The results showed 86.7% direction accuracy
(up or down) and 1.79% Mean Absolute Percent-
age Error. Although they achieved the high accu-
racy, there were only 15 transaction dates (from
December 1 to 19, 2008) in their test set. With
such a short period, it might not be sufficient to
conclude the effectiveness of their method.
A keyword-based algorithm was proposed to
identify the sentiment of tweets as positive, neu-
tral and negative for stock prediction (Vu et al.,
2012). Their model achieved around 75% accu-
racy. However, their test period was short, from
81h to 261h in September 2012, containing only 14
transaction dates.
Continuous Dirichlet Process Mixture (cDPM)
model was used to learn the daily topic set of Twit-
ter messages to predict the stock market (Si et al.,
2013). A sentiment time series was built based
on these topics. However, the time period of their
whole dataset is rather short, only three months.
Most of the researches tried to extract only the
opinions or sentiments. However, one important
missing thing is that opinions or sentiments are ex-
pressed on topics or aspects of companies. There-
fore, understanding on which topics of a given
stock people are expressing their opinion is very
important. Although the models for inferring the
topics and sentiments simultaneously have already
proposed as discussed in Subsection 2.2, to the
best of our knowledge, such models have never
applied for stock market prediction.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999288">
2.2 Aspect based Sentiment Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927829787234">
Some researches tried to identify the sentiment ex-
pressed toward an aspect in a sentence rather than
a whole sentence or document. The simple ap-
proach is to define a sentiment score of a given as-
pect by the weighted sum of opinion scores of all
words in the sentence, where the weight is defined
by the distance from the aspect (Liu and Zhang,
2012; Pang and Lee, 2008). This method is further
improved by identifying the aspect-opinion rela-
tions using tree kernel method (Nguyen and Shi-
rai, 2015).
Other researches trying to extract both the topic
and sentiment for some domains such as on-
line product, restaurant and movie review dataset.
ASUM is a model for extracting both the aspect
and sentiment for online product review dataset
(Jo and Oh, 2011). Joint sentiment/topic model
(JST) is another model to detect the sentiment and
topic simultaneously, which was applied for movie
review dataset (Lin and He, 2009). These models
assume that each word is generated from a joint
topic and sentiment distribution. It means that
these models do not distinguish the topic word and
opinion word distributions.
Besides the general opinion words, topic mod-
els considering aspect-specific opinion words
were also proposed. MaxEnt-LDA hybrid model
can jointly discover both aspects and aspect-
specific opinion words on a restaurant review
dataset (Zhao et al., 2010), while FACTS,
CFACTS, FACTS-R, and CFACTS-R model were
proposed for sentiment analysis on a product re-
view data (Lakkaraju et al., 2011). However, one
of the weaknesses of these methods is that there is
only one opinion word distribution corresponding
to one topic (aspect). It makes difficult to know
which sentiment (e.g. positive or negative) is ex-
pressed by the opinion words on that topic.
To overcome this drawback, we propose a new
topic model called Topic Sentiment Latent Dirich-
let Allocation (TSLDA), which estimates differ-
ent opinion word distributions for individual sen-
timent categories for each topic. To the best of our
knowledge, such a model has not been proposed.
TSLDA is suitable for not only sentiment analy-
sis for stock prediction but also general sentiment
analysis of the document, sentence and aspect.

presses only one topic and one opinion on that
topic. The topics are usually nouns, whereas the
opinion words are adjectives or adverbs. The
words in the document are classified into three cat-
egories, the topic word (category c = 1), opinion
word (c = 2) and others (c = 0). Then, we sup-
pose the different opinion words are used for the
different topics. Depending on the topic, an opin-
ion word may express different sentiment mean-
ing. For example, the opinion word “low” in “low
cost” and “low salary” have opposite polarity. In
our model, different topics, which are also repre-
sented by word distributions, will have different
opinion word distributions. Finally, to capture the
sentiment meanings such as positive, negative or
neutral of the opinion words for each topic, we
distinguish opinion word distributions for differ-
ent sentiment meanings.

to a specific value, we used an asterisk ∗ to denote
it. For example, Wk,s
∗,∗,v,c is the number of appear-
ance of combination (v, c, k, s) in any sentences
in any documents. Similarly, Zk,∗
d is the number
of times the document d has the topic k with any
sentiments.
A bold-font variable denotes the list of the vari-
ables. For instance, zt and w denote all of topic
assignments and words in all documents, respec-
tively.
−(d, m) stands for exclusion of the value in
the sentence m in the document d. For example,
zt−(d,m) denotes all of topic assignment variables
zt but ztd,m. Za,∗−(d,m) denotes the value of Za,∗
d d

We used square brackets for specifying the
value at the index of a vector or distribution. For
instance, α[v] denotes the value of α at index v.
Collapsed Gibbs Sampling was implemented
for inference in TSLDA. It will sequentially sam-
ple hidden variables zt d,m and zo d,m from the dis-

P(zt d,m = a, zo d,m = b|zt −(d,m), zo −(d,m), w, c)

This paper focuses on prediction of not the stock
price but movement of it. That is, our goal is to
develop a model that predicts if the stock price
goes up or down. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
has long been recognized as being able to effi-
ciently handle high dimensional data and has been
shown to perform well on many tasks such as text
classification (Joachims, 1998; Nguyen and Shi-

ear kernel as the prediction model. Furthermore,
features derived by sentiment analysis on the mes-
sage board are incorporated in it. To assess the ef-
fectiveness of sentiment analysis, four sets of fea-
tures are designed. The first one uses only the his-
torical prices. The other sets include topic and sen-
timent features obtained by different methods. All
the feature values are scaled into [−1, 1] value. Ta-

<bodyText confidence="0.999972772727273">
In this model, we consider each message as a mix-
ture of hidden topics. LDA is a generative prob-
abilistic model of a corpus 1. The basic idea is
that documents are represented as random mix-
tures over latent topics, where each topic is charac-
terized by a distribution over words. Hidden topics
of LDA are incorporated into the prediction model
as follows. First, stop words are removed from
the messages, and all the words are lemmatized by
Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014). Topics
are inferred by Gibbs Sampling with 1000 itera-
tions. Next, the probability of each topic for each
message is calculated. For each transaction date t,
the probability of each topic is defined as the aver-
age of the probabilities of the topic in all messages
posted on that transaction date.
Features used for training SVM are pricet−1,
pricet−2, ldai,t and ldai,t−1. ldai,t and ldai,t−1
are the probabilities of the topic i (i E
11, · · · , K}) for the transaction dates t and t − 1.
The number of the topics K is empirically deter-
mined as explained in Subsection 6.1.

When people post the message on social media to
express their opinion for a given stock, they tend
to talk their opinions for a given topic or aspect
such as profit and dividend. They would think
that the future price of the stock goes up or down
by seeing pairs of topic-sentiment written by oth-
ers. Following the above intuition, we propose a

tion model. Two methods are used to extract the
pairs of topic-sentiment from the message board.
One is a latent topic based model called JST (Lin
and He, 2009). The other is TSLDA discussed in
Section 3. This subsection introduces the method
using the former.
We consider each message as a mixture of hid-
den topics and sentiments. JST model is used to
extract topics and sentiments simultaneously. Fig-
ure 2 shows the graphical model representation of
JST. Notations in Figure 2 are shown in Table 4. In
LDA model, there is only one document specific
topic distribution. In contrast, each document in
JST is associated with multiple sentiment labels.
Each sentiment label is associated with a docu-
ment specific topic distribution. A word in the
document is drawn from a distribution over words
defined by the topic and sentiment label.
After removal of stop words and lemmatiza-
tion, JST model is trained by Gibbs Sampling with
1000 iterations. We chose 3 as the number of
sentiments which might represent negative, neu-
tral and positive. The number of the topics K
is empirically determined as explained in Subsec-
tion 6.1. Next, the joint probability of each pair
of topic and sentiment is calculated for each mes-
sage. For each transaction date t, the joint proba-
bility of each topic-sentiment pair is defined as the
average of the joint probabilities in the messages
on that transaction date. Then we integrate these
probabilities into the prediction model.
Features used for training SVM are pricet_1,
pricet_2, jsti,j,t and jsti,j,t_1. jsti,j,t and
jsti,j,t_1 are the joint probabilities of the sen-
timent i (i E 11, 2, 3}) and topic j (j E
11, · · · , K}) for the transaction dates t and t − 1.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.918254">
5.4 TSLDA-based Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978686419354839">
We use our TSLDA model to capture the topics
and sentiments simultaneously. First, a rule-based
algorithm is applied to identify the category of
each word in the documents. Consecutive nouns
are considered as topic words. If a word is not a
noun and in a list of opinion words in SentiWord-
Net (Baccianella et al., 2010), it is considered as
an opinion word. The rest of words are classified
as background words.
After lemmatization, TSLDA model is trained
by Collapsed Gibbs Sampling with 1000 itera-
tions. We chose 3 as the number of sentiments
which might represent for negative, neutral and
positive. K (number of topics) is determined as
explained in Subsection 6.1. The topic and its sen-
timent in each sentence are gotten from the topic
assignment and sentiment assignment in TSLDA.
If there is a sentence expressing the sentiment j
on the topic i, we represent the tuple (i, j) = 1,
and 0 otherwise. The proportion of (i, j) over all
sentences are calculated for each message. For
each transaction date, a weight of the tuple (i, j)
is defined as the average of the proportions over
all messages. Then we integrated the weights of
the topics and their sentiments into the prediction
model.
Features used for training SVM are pricet_1,
pricet_2, tsldai,j,t and tsldai,j,t_1. tsldai,j,t and
tsldai,j,t_1 are the weights of the topic i (i E
11, · · · , K}) with the sentiment j (j E 11, 2,3})
for the transaction dates t and t − 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.97239496">
We divided the dataset described in Section 4 into
three parts: training set from July 23, 2012 to
March 31, 2013, development set from April 01,
2013 to April 30, 2013, and test set from May
01, 2013 to July 19, 2013. The label of ‘up’
and ‘down’ is assigned to each transaction date by
comparing the price of the current and previous
dates.
To optimize the number of topics K for each
stock, we run the models with four values of K:
10, 20, 50 and 100. The best K is chosen for each
stock on the development set, and the systems with
the chosen K is evaluated on the test data. The
performance of the prediction is measured by ac-
curacy.
For the hyperparameters of LDA, JST and
TSLDA, we simply selected symmetric Dirich-
let prior vectors, that is all possible distributions
are likely equal. We used the default values of
these hyperparameters for LDA and JST. Con-
cretely speaking, α = 0.5, Q = 0.01 in LDA and
α = #topics, Q = 0.01, -y = 0.3 were used in JST.

For TSLDA, we set α = 0.1, A = 0.1, Q = 0.01
and -y = 0.01.

method with Price Only method. The results
showed that the model using mood information
outperformed the model without mood by 3.57%,
3.58%, 14.29% and 12.5% accuracy for XOM,
EBAY, IBM and KO stock, respectively. On the
other hand, the performance on DELL stock was
not improved. It means that the use of the mood
does not always make the performance better. The
mood from social media could lead to a wrong pre-
diction because of wrong prediction of message
writers, fault information and so on. However,
TSLDA was better than Price Only method on av-
erage of these stocks. In addition, TSLDA can re-
duce the number of FN, especially for IBM, al-
though FP was not changed in the sum of 5 stocks.
Thus, we can conclude that integrating the mood
information from social media can help to predict
stock price movement more precisely.
Next, let us compare the models for inferring la-
tent topics only (LDA) and topics and sentiments
(JST and TSLDA) in the stock movement predic-
tion. The accuracy of JST-based method was bet-
ter than LDA for two stocks (XOM and IBM),
worse for three stocks and comparable in the aver-

sults indicate that (1) our idea to use both latent
topics and sentiments as the features is effective,
(2) TSLDA is more appropriate model than JST in
stock movement prediction.
Table 7 shows examples of highly associated
words of some topics for stock KO (Coca-Cola
Company) in TSLDA. For example, ‘split’, ‘stock’
and ‘share’ are words highly associated with the
hidden topic 2, and ‘drink’, ‘coke’ and ‘water’ are
highly associated with the topic 3. The first five
hidden topics in Table 7 may represent the man-
agement, stock market trading, product, customer
care service, competitors of the company, while
the last one indicates macroeconomic factors. Ta-
ble 8 shows examples of highly associated words
of three sentiments of the hidden topic 1 and 2. For
the hidden topic 1, ‘growth’, ‘strong’, ‘solid’ etc.
are the words highly associated with the hidden
sentiment 3 (which may corresponds to positive
class), while ‘old’, ‘tired’, ‘unreal’ etc. with the
hidden sentiment 1 (may be negative). In general,
however, it is rather difficult to interpret the mean-
ing of the hidden sentiment because the sentiments
have many dimensions such as happy, anger, sad,
vital and so on. We also found that the words
with high probabilities in the background distribu-
tion were the stop words, punctuations, function
words, messy characters written in social media,
e.g. ‘.’, ‘the’, ‘and’, ‘you’, ‘$’, ‘for’ and ‘?’.
Table 9 shows top words in some joint senti-
ment topic distributions of JST model for stock
KO. For example, ‘yahoo’, ‘ko’ and ‘finance’ are
highly associated with the distribution defined by
hidden sentiment 1 and hidden topic 1. However,
it is rather difficult to guess which sentiment or
topic in this joint distribution actually means.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999755">
This paper presents the method to infer the top-
ics and their sentiments on the documents and use
them for prediction of the stock movement. The
results of the experiments show the effectiveness
of our proposed TSLDA-based method. Although
56% accuracy of our method is not so high, it can
be satisfying results as regarded in the previous pa-
pers. Another advantage of the paper is the eval-
uation by the large scale experiment (five stocks,
three month transaction dates in the test set).
The drawback of TSLDA is that we have to
specify the number of topics and sentiment be-
forehand. To overcome it, TSLDA should be ex-
tended as a non-parametric topic model estimating
the number of topics inherent in the data. This will
be done in our future work.

To achieve this goal, discovering the topics and sentiments in a large amount of social media is important to get opinions of investors as well as events of companies. However, sentiment analysis on social media is difficult. The text is usually short, contains many misspellings, uncommon grammar constructions and so on. In addition, the literature shows conflicting results in sentiment analysis for stock market prediction. Some researchers report that the sentiments from social media have no predictive capabilities (Antweiler and Frank, 2004; Tumarkin and Whitelaw, 2001), while other researchers have reported either weak or strong predictive capabilities (Bollen et al., 2011). Therefore, how to use opinions in social media for stock price predictions is still an open problem. Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1. We propose a new feature “topic-sentiment” for the stock market prediction model. 2. We propose a new topic model, Topic Sentiment Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TSLDA), which can capture the topic and sentiment simultaneously. 3. Large scale evaluation.

A novel tree representation based on semantic frame parsers is proposed (Xie et al., 2013). By using stock prices from Yahoo Finance, they annotated all the news in a transaction date with going up or down categories. However, the weakness of this assumption is that all the news in one day will have the same category. In addition, this is a task of text classification, not stock prediction. Naive Bayes was used to classify messages from message boards into three classes: buy, hold and sell (Antweiler and Frank, 2004). They were integrated into the regression model. However, they concluded that their model does not successfully predict stock returns. A method to measure collective hope and fear on each day and analyze the correlation between these indices and the stock market indicators was 1355 proposed (Zhang et al., 2011).

First, a rule-based algorithm is applied to identify the category of each word in the documents. Consecutive nouns are considered as topic words. If a word is not a noun and in a list of opinion words in SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010), it is considered as an opinion word. The rest of words are classified as background words. After lemmatization, TSLDA model is trained by Collapsed Gibbs Sampling with 1000 iterations. We chose 3 as the number of sentiments which might represent for negative, neutral and positive. K (number of topics) is determined as explained in Subsection 6.1. The topic and its sentiment in each sentence are gotten from the topic assignment and sentiment assignment in TSLDA. If there is a sentence expressing the sentiment j on the topic i, we represent the tuple (i, j) = 1, and 0 otherwise. The proportion</context>

It is an extended model of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). We assume that one sentence ex1356 Figure 1: Graphical Model Representation of TSLDA presses only one topic and one opinion on that topic.

However, sentiment analysis on social media is difficult. The text is usually short, contains many misspellings, uncommon grammar constructions and so on. In addition, the literature shows conflicting results in sentiment analysis for stock market prediction. Some researchers report that the sentiments from social media have no predictive capabilities (Antweiler and Frank, 2004; Tumarkin and Whitelaw, 2001), while other researchers have reported either weak or strong predictive capabilities (Bollen et al., 2011). Therefore, how to use opinions in social media for stock price predictions is still an open problem. Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1. We propose a new feature “topic-sentiment” for the stock market prediction model. 2. We propose a new topic model, Topic Sentiment Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TSLDA), which can capture the topic and sentiment simultaneously. 3. Large scale evaluation.

According to the EMH (Fama et al., 1969; Fama, 1991), the current stock market fully reflects all available information. Hence, price changes are merely due to new information or news. Because news in nature happens randomly and is unknowable in the present, stock prices should follow a random walk pattern and the best bet for the next price is the current price. Therefore, they are not predictable with more than about 50% accuracy (Walczak, 2001). On the other hand, various researches specify that the stock market prices do not follow a random walk, and can be predicted in some degree (Bollen et al., 2011; Qian and Rasheed, 2007; Vu et al., 2012). Degrees of accuracy at 56% hit rate in the predictions are often reported as satisfying results for stock predictions (Schumaker and Chen, 2009b; Si et al., 2013; Tsibouris and Zeidenberg, 1995). Besides the efficient market hypothesis and the random walk theories, there are two distinct trading philosophies for stock market prediction: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. The fundamental analysis studies the company’s financial conditions, operations, macroeconomic indicators to predict the stock price. On the other hand, the technical analy</context>

To discover the pattern in the data, they used Bayesian network (Zuo and Kita, 2012a; Zuo and Kita, 2012b), time-series method such as Auto Regressive, Moving Average, Auto Regressive Moving Average model (Zuo and Kita, 2012a) and so on. 2.1 Extracting Opinions from Text Sentiment analysis has been found to play a significant role in many applications such as product and restaurant reviews (Liu and Zhang, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008).

In the past, the main source was the news (Schumaker and Chen, 2009a; Schumaker and Chen, 2009b), and in recent years, social media sources.

LDA is a generative probabilistic model of a corpus 1. The basic idea is that documents are represented as random mixtures over latent topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words. Hidden topics of LDA are incorporated into the prediction model as follows. First, stop words are removed from the messages, and all the words are lemmatized by Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014). Topics are inferred by Gibbs Sampling with 1000 iterations. Next, the probability of each topic for each message is calculated. For each transaction date t, the probability of each topic is defined as the average of the probabilities of the topic in all messages posted on that transaction date. Features used for training SVM are pricet−1, pricet−2, ldai,t and ldai,t−1. ldai,t and ldai,t−1 are the probabilities of the topic i (i E 11, · · · , K}) for the transaction dates t and t − 1.

The list of the stock quotes and company names is shown in Table 2. For each transaction date, there are open, high, low, close and adjusted close prices. The adjusted close prices are the close prices which are adjusted for dividends and splits. They are often used for stock market prediction as in other researches (Rechenthin et al., 2013).

Most of the researches tried to extract only the opinions or sentiments. However, one important missing thing is that opinions or sentiments are expressed on topics or aspects of companies.

To achieve this goal, discovering the topics and sentiments in a large amount of social media is important to get opinions of investors as well as events of companies. However, sentiment analysis on social media is difficult. The text is usually short, contains many misspellings, uncommon grammar constructions and so on. In addition, the literature shows conflicting results in sentiment analysis for stock market prediction. Some researchers report that the sentiments from social media have no predictive capabilities (Antweiler and Frank, 2004; Tumarkin and Whitelaw, 2001), while other researchers have reported either weak or strong predictive capabilities (Bollen et al., 2011).

Continuous Dirichlet Process Mixture (cDPM) model was used to learn the daily topic set of Twitter messages to predict the stock market (Si et al., 2013). A sentiment time series was built based on these topics. However, the time period of their whole dataset is rather short, only three months. Most of the researches tried to extract only the opinions or sentiments. However, one important missing thing is that opinions or sentiments are exp</context>

Some of the researches were based on the random walk theory and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). According to the EMH (Fama et al., 1969; Fama, 1991), the current stock market fully reflects all available information. Hence, price changes are merely due to new information or news. Because news in nature happens randomly and is unknowable in the present, stock prices should follow a random walk pattern and the best bet for the next price is the current price. Therefore, they are not predictable with more than about 50% accuracy (Walczak, 2001). On the other hand, various researches specify that the stock market prices do not follow a random walk, and can be predicted in some degree (Bollen et al., 2011; Qian and Rasheed, 2007; Vu et al., 2012). Degrees of accuracy at 56% hit rate in the predictions are often reported as satisfying results for stock predictions (Schumaker and Chen, 2009b; Si et al., 2013; Tsibouris and Zeidenberg, 1995). Besides the efficient market hypothesis and the random walk theories, there are two distinct trading philosophies for stock market prediction: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.

Most of the previous work primarily used the bag-of-words as text representation that are incorporated into the prediction model. Schumaker and Chen tried to use different textual representations such as bag-of-words, noun phrases and named entities for financial news (Schumaker and Chen, 2009b). However, the textual representations are just the words or named entity tags, not exploiting the mood information so much. A novel tree representation based on semantic frame parsers is proposed (Xie et al., 2013). By using stock prices from Yahoo Finance, they annotated all the news in a transaction date with going up or down categories. However, the weakness of this assumption is that all the news in one day will have the same category. In addition, this is a task of text classification, not stock prediction. Naive Bayes was used to classify messages from message boards into three classes: buy, hold and sell (Antweiler and Frank, 2004). They were integrated into the regression model. However, they concluded that their model does not successfully predict stock returns. A method to measure collective h</context>

Naive Bayes was used to classify messages from message boards into three classes: buy, hold and sell (Antweiler and Frank, 2004). They were integrated into the regression model. However, they concluded that their model does not successfully predict stock returns. A method to measure collective hope and fear on each day and analyze the correlation between these indices and the stock market indicators was 1355 proposed (Zhang et al., 2011). They used the mood words to tag each tweet as fear, worry, hope and so on. They concluded that the ratio of the emotional tweets significantly negatively correlated with Down Jones, NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500, but positively with VIX. However, they did not use their model to predict the stock price values. Two mood tracking tools, OpinionFinder and Google Profile of Mood States, were used to analyze the text content of daily Twitter (Bollen et al., 2011). The former measures the positive and negative mood. The latter measures the mood in terms of six dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and H</context>

Joint sentiment/topic model (JST) is another model to detect the sentiment and topic simultaneously, which was applied for movie review dataset (Lin and He, 2009). These models assume that each word is generated from a joint topic and sentiment distribution. It means that these models do not distinguish the topic word and opinion word distributions. Besides the general opinion words, topic models considering aspect-specific opinion words were also proposed. MaxEnt-LDA hybrid model can jointly discover both aspects and aspectspecific opinion words on a restaurant review dataset (Zhao et al., 2010), while FACTS, CFACTS, FACTS-R, and CFACTS-R model were proposed for sentiment analysis on a product review data (Lakkaraju et al., 2011). However, one of the weaknesses of these methods is that there is only one opinion word distribution corresponding to one topic (aspect). It makes difficult to know which sentiment (e.g. positive or negative) is expressed by the opinion words on that topic. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new topic model called Topic Sentiment Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TSLDA), which estimates different opinion word distributions for individual sentiment categories</context>
