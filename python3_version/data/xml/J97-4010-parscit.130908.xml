Marconi&apos;s main question is what it means for
a person (or computer system) to be seman-
tically competent, especially with respect to
the meaning of open-class words. His claim
is that there are two components to lexi-
cal competence: referential competence and
inferential competence. The different types
of knowledge required by each correspond
in some ways to T-box and A-box knowl-
edge (terminological and assertional knowl-
edge) in KL-ONE–like knowledge represen-
tation systems; but Marconi&apos;s distinction is
principled, not merely a stipulation bolstered
by intuition as it has been in research in
knowledge representation. Marconi&apos;s theory
is not a semantic theory, although it is closely
related to semantic theories; rather, it is a
cognitive theory—a theory of what it is that
people know when they use words cor-
rectly. But this obliges Marconi to take on
the philosophers of linguistic semantics—
Putnam, Burge, Fodor, Searle, and others—
and carefully distinguish his approach from
many semantic theories.
Marconi begins with a critical historical re-
view. Most philosophers of language have
been concerned more with linguistic struc-
ture and composition than with lexicons or
content. (Wittgenstein saw no lexical prob-
lems other than naming!) To the extent that
there was any emphasis in this research on
lexical matters, it was on questions such as
&amp;quot;meaning as reference,&amp;quot; and the distinctions
between extension and intension or between
sense and reference. This led to approaches
that were based on truth rather than con-
tent, with meaning postulates as constraints
on possible worlds. Marconi complains that
meaning postulates are quite inadequate:
they don&apos;t give a unique interpretation; they
are still just uninterpreted symbols; and they
say almost nothing about what we really
know about a word, such as the associated
encyclopedic or world knowledge. Semantic
nets and other knowledge representations,
decompositional semantics, Lakoff&apos;s proto-
types, and Putnam&apos;s stereotypes fare no bet-
ter.
Marconi then introduces his basic idea:
Lexical competence, with respect to any par-
ticular word, is knowledge of true sentences
in which the word is used plus knowl-
edge of its application in the world (p. 58).
The latter component is the usual kind
of competence: referential. We can identify
a primrose without needing to know ev-
erything about primroses. But conversely,
most people know quite a bit about ura-
nium and yet would not be able to recog-
nize it if they saw it; they have only the
first component. An expert has both com-
ponents of competence. And the two com-
ponents interact: one can be obtained from
the other. But, while the two are not rigidly
separated, Marconi spends a lot of time
showing that they are indeed distinct and
independent—and that studies of aphasia
show that the distinction is cognitively real.
He spends considerable effort defending his
approach against objectivist theories of refer-
ence.
The problem of determining, through ob-
servation of its actions, whether or not an
entity has understood some linguistic in-
put brings Marconi to Searle&apos;s well-known
&amp;quot;Chinese-room&amp;quot; problem. Marconi&apos;s answer
to Searle is that, yes, the Chinese room is
merely doing symbol processing without un-
derstanding, but this does not preclude there
being some linguistic competence. The Chi-
nese room is still not linguistically competent
in Marconi&apos;s sense, as it has at best only infer-
ential, not referential, competence. This leads
Marconi to a discussion of the role of visual
perception and recognition in linguistic com-
petence, and the prospects for Al systems
with vision and language. Marconi&apos;s posi-
tion, contra Searle, is that for his purposes,
such robots would indeed be equivalent to
