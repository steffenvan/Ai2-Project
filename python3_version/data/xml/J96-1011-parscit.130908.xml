verbs, known as clitics. The book is
unique in its depth and breadth of data,
comparing several different languages

The essays in this collection are based
on the second Workshop on Logic,
Language and Computation at Stanford,
in 1993. It brought together researchers
interested in natural language to discuss
the current state of the art at the border-
line of logic, linguistics and computer
science.

Meaning and

Reinhard Muskens

<bodyText confidence="0.954247888888889">
This book develops a theory of meaning
in ordinary language. The theory is
strictly formalized on the basis of formal
logic and the book contributes to the
general discipline of Formal Semantics.
Within this field it offers a synthesis
between two leading paradigms.

The Interaction Between Temporal
and Atemporal Structure
Henk J. Verkuyl

<figureCaption confidence="0.49669">
Sentences may pertain to states or
processes or events. They may express
boundedness, duration, repetition,
frequency, and many other forms
of temporality. This text presents a
theory about aspectual properties of
sentences in natural languages.

Within a unification-based framework,
the author draws out pervasive patterns
in the relationship between morpho-

of dative substitution in Icelandic, the
author moves on to examine a wide

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993433">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.925431">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9959229375">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.

The paper</note>
<abstract confidence="0.987702578947368">should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. to the Editor: category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.</abstract>

A European chapter was in 1982. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.</abstract>
