LETTERS: CONCERNING IGOR NELICHUK
On 14 July 1976, T received &amp;quot;An Open Letter to Colleagues&amp;quot; from Dr.
Igor A. Mel&apos;cuk, a prominent Soviet computational linguist. He had sent
It to me on 16 May, but it reached me only through an indirect routing.
</note>
<tableCaption confidence="0.800422047619048">
The contents indicate that Dr. Mel&apos;cuk has been fired from his position
as Senior Research Fellow of the Institute of Linguistics of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences. The motivation for this action is ascribed to a
letter, published in the New York Times on 26 January 1976, in which he
criticized Soviet actions against Andrei Sakharov an Sergei Kovalev.
Dr. Mel&apos;cuk asked me to make the information about his dismissal
available to American scientists. On his-behalf, I have written to a
number of relevant periodicals asking them to publish his letter: The
Executive Cammattee of the Association for Comp,tational Linguistics
considered this request and decided that the letter should be published,
along with other relevant material, in The Finite String. Accordingly,
I am attaching, in order, a copy of the letter he transmitted to me,
dated 16 May 3976; the original New York Times letter of 26 January
1976; a short item in the March 27 New York Times describing his firing;
a letter to the editor in the 10 April New York Times from Chomsky and
Evers expressing their concern; two articles, one by Robert Toth
published in the 2 June 1976 Los Angeles Times and one by Christopher
Wren published in the 36 June 3976 New York Times; and a letter to the
editor by Igor Ttoyanovsky, a Soviet journalist, published in the Los
Angeles Times on 7 August 1976, which presents the Soviet view of the
action taken against Mel&apos;cuk.

The letter Dr. Mel&apos;cuk sent me also has appeared or will appear,
with various amounts of editing, in ,the Bulletin of the Linguistic

AN OPEN LETTER TO COLLEAGUES

Dear Colleague:

<bodyText confidence="0.748236636363636">
On March 25, 1976, at a session of the Faculty Board (or, perhaps,
the Scientific Council: Ucenyo Sovet) of the Institute of Linguistics,
Soviet Academy of Sciences, Moscow, I was not re-elected senior research
fellow, the position I held been. holding up to the said date. (In
accordance with regulations any research fellow of any Soviet Academy
institution is supposed to be re-elected by the respective Faculty Board
every three years--for junior fellows or every five years--for senior
fellows, which happens to be my case. It is ordinarily quite a routine
procedure which as a rule should not even be attended by the person
concerned. Tn case he is not re-elected the researcher is to be fired
by the administration in no more than a year after the decision by the
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.8448825">
Faculty Board took place).
The Faculty Board met 24 members being present: Victoria N.
Ytrtseva (the director of the Institute of Linguistics), Yurij S.
Fliseev (the assistant director), Valentin A. Efimov (the scientific

Bertagaev, Nikolaj S. Cemodanov, Yunus D. Deseriev, Nined Z. Gadzieva,
Myrrha M. Guxman, Georgij A. Klimov, Renat G. gotov, Gennadij V.
Kolsanskij, Muxammed A. Kumaxov, Klara E. Majtinskaja, Sergej A.
Mironov, Kenesbaj M. Musaev, Vera S. Rastorgueva, Natalja A. Sljusareva,
Aleksandr D. Svejtser, Edgem R. Tenisev, Oleg N. Trubacev, Said M.
Xajdakov, and Igor&apos; F. Vtrdul&apos;. Here are the results of the secret
ballot: 19 votes against my re-election, 2, for, and 3 have been
considered not valid (which essentially meahs abstention). In view of
such a decision of the Faculty Board, April 8 the assistant director of
the Institute, Ybrij S. Eliseev informed me that I am fired beginning
from May 18 this year.
I have been with the Institute of Linguistics since 3956. During
this period I have authored and published more than 150 linguistic
works, including several books; many of my papers are translated and
published in the USA, France, Spain, West Germany, Poland, Hungary, and
East Germany. Many times I was invited to take part in international
linguistic conventions, to present lectures, to. serve on editorial
boards of some Western linguistic periodicals, etc.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.687383">
Yet the Faculty Board did not judge me worth holding my job. The
</subsectionHeader>
<tableCaption confidence="0.534195571428571">
only reason explicitly stated was my letter published in The New York
Times on Januamad 26, 1976. The letter expressed my disagreement with
the campaign caged against Andrej D. Saxarov by the Soviet press as well
as my protest against the arrest and the trial of the eminent Soviet
scientist, biophysicist Sergej Koyaljov who has been sentenced to 7
years in prison and 3 more years in exile (under purely political
accusations).

Yet the Soviet Union ratified the International Pact on Civil and
Political Rights (adopted December 16, 1966, by the XXI Session of the
general Assembly of the United Nations) which--in accordance with the
Soviet legislation (see Art. 569 of the Civil Code of the Russian
Soviet Federative Socialist Republic)--has become eo ipso a Soviet law.
Art. 19 of the said Pact gives me &amp;quot;a full right to freely express my
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967847921052631">
opinions including the freedom of disseminating any kind of information
and ideas independently, of national borders--orally, in writing or by
means of the press.&amp;quot; Consequently, addressing my letter to The New York
Times I have by no means violated the laws of my country. (Even if it
were not the case I should have been persecuted by the Soviet justice
and not, for that matter, by the Faculty Board of an academic
institution!)
Contrary to what has been presented in the preceding paragraph,
those taking the floor at the Faculty Board meeting said: the letter by
I. Mel&apos;cuk &amp;quot;besmirches our country and covers with shame any research
worker,... such an action is inadmissible not only in the scientific
community of the Institute, but in the community of all Soviet people as
well&amp;quot; (V. Yartseva, the director);* &amp;quot;slandering against our country
I.A. Mel&apos;cuk does serious harm not only to it but also to all
progressive mankind.., so that his hostile action makes impossible
further presence of I. Mel&apos;cuk in the Institute of Linguistics&amp;quot;
(M. GUxman); &amp;quot;it is in vain that I.A. Mel&apos;cuk refers to same obscure
fsic!] pacts and tries to artificially limit the range of criticisms
aimed at the &apos;moral-political&apos; image (moralino-politiceskij oblik) of
himself as a Soviet scholar&amp;quot; (Yu. Eliseev, the assistant directoi); &amp;quot;the
position of T. Mel&apos;cuk borders on war propaganda,... and all his
behavior produces a very bad impression: we hoped to hear words of
repent but what we actually heard is a firm conviction (N. Gadzieva),
etc. Those speeches were summed up in the second address by
V. Yartseva: &amp;quot;The world is split in two, and I. A. Mel&apos;cuk turns for
help to our enemies!&amp;quot;
It should be emphasized that in the Institute where I have worked
for almost 20 years and where I thought I had enough friends since I
maintained with many not only professional but also warm human relations
for a long time, there was no one who wold side with me or at least say
a few words in my favor. More than that: as far as I know, no one of
the Soviet scientists (my personal friends excluded) found it possible
or necessary to defend me in some form they would consider appropriate.
The purely political character of my firing makes it practically
impossible for me to find another job anywhere in the USSR--the more so
for even before the above-mentioned decision by the Faculty Board my
position in the Soviet science was a very difficult and precarious one.
For severe] years I have had practically no possibility to publish my

papers in leading Soviet linguistic journals. (The appearance of each
of my papers required no less than a heroic deed on the part of some
member of editorial board). The secood volume of my monograph TOward a
Theory of Linguistic Models of the Meaning&lt;=&gt;Text Type (the product of
meny years of painstaking work) waited for publication more than 8 years
and failed to be, aftet all, published. I was and am forbidden to
teach, to take part in many scientific conventions, to go abroad for
contacts with Western colleagues. Immediately after the appearance of
my letter in The New York Times Soviet linguistic periodicals and
publishing houses began suppressing references to my &apos;works,
acknowledgements by other authors mentioring my name (e.g. Serge°
Ya. Fokin, head of the editorial staff of Naucnotexniceskaja
informacija, National Institute of Technological Information--VINITI,
Moscow) and even my name as the editor or translator (as did Prof.
Nikolaj S. Cemodanov and Klavdija T. Bogdanova of the Progress
publishers).
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.8778875">
Under such conditions and having no permanent job I am left without
the least possibility for normal continuation of my linguistic research.
Which amounts to putting me before a tragic choice: either a meaningless
existence in my country, which needs not my work and effort, or
emigration meaning the lifelong separation (such is the Stiviet law) from
my native land as well as from my relatives, friends, and colleagues.
I understand quite clearly that my situation cannot even be
compered with the terrible lot of those people who, deprived of their
freedom, are serving their terms in Soviet prisons and labor camps For
political reasons and whose health and perhaps life are in danger. But
still I feel I have the moral right to address the public opinion since
it is not my personality that is of importance here. My case is but a
modest yet very vivid illustration of the moral life of the top layer of
Soviet intellectual society--of what used to be known as the famous
Russian intelligentsia. It is an additional touch to the monstrous
chronicle of felonies and base toadyism which were and are so easily
practiced in the USSR by many persons holding scientific degrees and
often posts of responsibility in the Soviet science hierarchy.
The aim of th)e letter is too make its readers seriously ponder
once again over the fate of Soviet scholars and scientists Forced to
choose between low-down behavior and emigration. (Bright times now!
not so long ago they had to choose between felony and a bullet or, in
the best case, years behind the barbed Wire). Do not Forget, please,
that each of them with the exclusion of a few active militants like
Andrej D. Saxarov or Igor R. Safarevic is either a victim, or a hangman,
or--which is perhaps the most dangeromo thinq--a tacit accomplice of
hangmen.

Sakharov: World Symbol of Redemption
TO the Editor:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963663363636364">
I am writing this letter to a Western newspaper because T am not
allowed to express-my opiniOns in the U.S.S.R. My subject is the great
Soviet physicist and Nobel Prize winner Andrei Sakharov.
Except for party- or government-inspired press attacks on him, in
my country the silence over Sakharov is complete. But the West should
know that there are many people here--and I am one of them--who strongly
disapprove of the dirty campaign waged against the man who is perhaps
the only absolutely honest person among our eminent scientists.
The most absolute lack of overt support for Sakharov among highly
placed Soviet scientists and scholars clearly demonstrates that there is
no such thing as the Russian intelligentsia any more. If Sakharov&apos;s
colleagues and former friends, such as Marlton and Zee&apos;dovic (npt to
speak of the sixty other academicians and professors) signed the
&amp;quot;letter&amp;quot; denouncing Sakharov, it can mean only that moral considerations
are fully excluded from the mentality of those who should base the whole
of their activities and lives on moral principles.
It is difficult to compare different ordeals, but last month a
tribunal in Vilnius sentenced to seven years&apos; imprisonment plus three
years of exile the biophysicist Sergei Kovalev, a member of Sakharov&apos;s
Committee for Human Rights. For a scientizt of more than forty years of
age this means death--spiritually and mentally, if not literally. Not
one Soviet scientist protested. The members of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences have become soulless cuppets, devoid of convictions and
conscience.
As for the West, I cannot understand the attitude of your
scientists and scholars. Perhaps they do not fully realize that a
powerful nation of 25Q million, guided by the unscrupulous and having at
its disposal first-class brans with no hearts and souls, may prove
highlSr dangerous.
The examples of Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Laos, Cambodia, and Angola
show the impotence of the West in the face of the Communist machine,
And real freedom and human rights in the Soviet Union are ag important
(if not more important) to the world) as they ate to ys.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.5635768">
Please do not forget that there are many here kept in jails, labor
camps and prison psychiatric hospitals who are suffering also for your
freedom. Sakharov is for us--and should be for the world--a symbol of
redemption.

According to a March 27 news story, the well-known Russian linguist
Igor A. Mel&apos;cuk has been dismissed from his position at the Linguistic
Institute in Moscow, where he has worked for the past twenty years.
This represents a severe intensification in the harassment of Melscuk,
who has been attacked in the past for his defense of other Soviet
citizens, including Daniel and Sinyavsky.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.7800215">
The latest act of repression follows Mellcuk&apos;s outspoken support
for Sakharov and Kovolev, both members of the Russian COmmittee for the
Rights of Man, and may have been a direct result of a letter of
Mel&apos;cuk&apos;s published in The Times [Jan. 25].

Soviet Linguist Fired for &apos;Ideological Mistakes&apos;
By Robert C. Toth
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.947952620689655">
MOSCOW—On the face of it, the scientific council of the Institute
of Linguistics of the Soviet Academy of Science was meeting to review
the work of a senior researcher before his recertification to his post.
Normally it would be a matter of form.
But in reality, the senior scientist—Igor Alexandrovich Melchuk,
said by U.S. and Soviet linguists to be the best in his field-awas
being tried behind closed doors for political nonconformity.
The secretly taped proceedings of March 25 show what criteria his
judges used. A transcript of the tape has been obtained by The Los
Angeles Times and its authenticity has been verified.
&amp;quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if your [scientific) theories are successful or
not,&amp;quot; declared one council member. &amp;quot;Scientific and political positions
are not of the same importance.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Mistakes in scientific work are one thing, but ideological
mistakes,&amp;quot; insisted another, &amp;quot;are quite another thing. They are simply
awful... and must be judged most harshly.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Fklaluating the work of a Soviet scientist cannot be narrowly
academic,&amp;quot; said a third, citing official rules for certifying scientists
that require &amp;quot;definite political and moral standards as well.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Igor. Alexandrovich is trying to claim that it is a personal
matter, thir statement against Soviet ideology,&amp;quot; said a fourth. &amp;quot;That
is impermissible.&amp;quot;
And 90 it went, focusing on his political faults and virtually
ignoring his scientific capabilities. Melchuk, 43, who has been
compared to the outstanding U.S. linguist Noam Chomsky, was fired from
the institute. His books were to be withdrawn from libraries. Other
books footnoting his works must be revised.
Melchuk knew well the limits of the nonconformity permitted in the
Soviet system and he stepped beyond them.

difficulties in his personal relationships. &amp;quot;Outspoken,&amp;quot; admitted a
friend; &amp;quot;impudent,&amp;quot; complained a judge.
He had trouble entering graduate school despite a straight-A
average at the university. His graduate advisor was fired for
associating with the late Nobel laureate Boris Pasternak, the dissident

author, and Melchuk wrote a letter to the higher education ministry
defending the professor.
He then left graduate study to work on language translation by
machine. A series of articles on the sublect earned him a candidate
degree (between masters and doctors) in an unprecedented recognition of
his abilities.
But he was not permitted to defend his doctorate thesis, for by
that time he had signed other letters. One had asked &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot;
for dissidents Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavski in 1966; another
protested the 3968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.
Then he recanted.
&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; Me3chuk acknowledged during the March trial. &amp;quot;I expressed
my regret for past statements. Frankly, I did so only because I was
afraid. I acted cowardly. But I&apos;m tired of fear. I have no more
fear.&amp;quot;
The recanting had done him little good. At least seven times
between 1071 and 1975, the transcript shows, he was not allowed to
travel abriad to scientific conferences, even when the conference
offered to pay his way.
&amp;quot;We did not send Igor Alexandrovich abroad,&amp;quot; said Victoria N.
Yartseva, institute director, &amp;quot;because every Soviet scientists
represents our system and our Soviet ideology abroad, and Igor
Alexandrovich always emphasizes: &apos;It&apos;s mine, it is my personal
opinion&apos;. Either Igor Alexandrovich is with us or he is with them.&amp;quot;
Professionally, Melchuk had more than 150 publications to his
credit in 20 years. A West German publishing house offered in 1971 to
publish his major work, &amp;quot;Sense:Text,&amp;quot; but the Soviet linguistic
institute refused permission. The first volume of that work appeared
here in 1974 but the second half, which should have appeared
simultaneously, still has not come out and is now badly outdate:a.
Linguistics ranges from the study of grammar and language origins
to information and communication theory and learning. Melchuk&apos;s book,
said an American linguist who read it all, &amp;quot;is a masterpiece of
organization and comprehensiveness.
&amp;quot;Bad it been published promptly when written ... the result would
have been a classic, if not a bible, of linguistic theory. It is an
ambitious and explicit attempt to, integrate the Soviet analytical
approach and the American descriptiva approach at a time when synthesis
of the two is in the air.&amp;quot;

Another American linguist said, &amp;quot;He has not blazed new frontiers in
the sense that Chomsky has. On the other hand Melchuk is by far the
best Soviet linguist.&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.304529666666667">
Melchuk abandoned his several-year public silence with a letter to
the New York Times defending Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D.
Sakharov. It appeared January 25.

<bodyText confidence="0.909593652173913">
&amp;quot;I am not allowed to . express my opinions in the U.S.S.R.,&amp;quot; he
wrote. Many Soviets &amp;quot;strongly disapprove the dirty campaign&amp;quot; against
Sakharov who is &amp;quot;perhaps the last honest scientist&amp;quot; here, he continued.
Members of the science academy were &amp;quot;soulless puppets,&amp;quot; he wrote.
&amp;quot;A powerful nation of 250 million, guided by the unscrupulous and having
at its disposal first-class brains with no hearts, may prove highly
dangerous,&amp;quot; he warned. Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Vietnam and Angola show
Western impotence, he concluded.
Whatever its merits, that letter apparently had not been read by
any of Melchuk&apos;s judges. A voice from the audience, from which
&amp;quot;outsiders&amp;quot; were barred, asked to know its contents. The institute&apos;s
deputy director replied that he had not seen ft. &amp;quot;but so far as I know
it is written in support of Sakharov and reduces to three points,&amp;quot; which
he recounted accurately. Melchuk then offered to read and discuss the
letter with anyone, but only after the council&apos;s decision on his future.
&amp;quot;I consider it impermissible to mix the question of my recertification
with my letter.
He cited a United Nations resolution of 1966, ratified by the
Soviet Union and incorporated into Soviet law, that guarantees the
freedom of expression, within a state or across borders.
But institute deputy director Yuri S. Eliseev countered that the
certifying rules for Soviet scientists set political as well as
scientific standards, and he brushed off&apos; the international treaty.

Criticism of Melchuk rose in pitch toward the end of the session.

<bodyText confidence="0.972486">
Ideological mistakes, said M. Khaidov, trade union member of the
scientific council, &amp;quot;must be judged most harshly ... Igor
Alexandrovich, you stand on the cliff. We wanted to pull you away.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;You become the puppet in somebody&apos;s dirty hands!&amp;quot; shouted
institute director Yartseva.
&amp;quot;I had hoped to hear words of repentance but I heard only deep
conviction,&amp;quot; said Ninel Z. Gadrieva, the People Control Commission&apos;s
representative on the scientific council: &amp;quot;Your action borders on the
propaganda war and under the Soviet constitution, that&apos;s a crime. It
hurts me but we have lost you.&amp;quot;

We know very well that world is divided into two parts, and you appeal

&amp;quot;I think that this open discussion has been useful,&amp;quot; she then said
abruptly.
Melchuk asked for a final word. Yartseva refused. &amp;quot;Everything is

Dismissal of-Soviet Linguist Exemplifies
Moscow&apos;s Political Curbs on Science
By Christopher S. Wren
Special to The New York Times
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986306705882353">
MOSCOW, June 13--&amp;quot;Errors of a scientific character are one thing,
but ideological errors are entirely another--these are absolttely
terrible,&amp;quot; declared an official at the Institute of Linguistics of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences.
The occasion was a meeting reviewing the activities of Igor A.
Melchukt a prominent Soviet linguist, for a nominally routine
reappointment to the institute staff. The outcome was that Mr. Melchuk
was ousted from his post as senior research fellow.
His scientific credentials were not criticized - -professionally he
has been compared with the American linguistic., scholar Noam Chomsky --but
his ideological errors included writing a letter to The New York Times
last January in defense of another dissident scientist, the Nobel peace
laureate Andre D. Sakharov.
Consequently, Mr. Melchuk was discharged. &amp;quot;The whole session was a
monstrous farce,&amp;quot; the 43-year old linguist related. &amp;quot;I worked at the
institute for 20 years and published 150 books and papers. And no one
there had the courage to stand up and say a kind word about me.&amp;quot;

Political Reliability
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989898107142857">
The case highlights the priorities set by the Soviet scientific
establishment, which the Soviet Union says, has a quarter of the world&apos;s
scientists.
Their advancement depends on political reliability as well as
scientific curiousity. The price for running against, the political
grain is stiff. Scientists showing signs of dissidence are promptly
shorn of prestige and position; their work, perhaps based on years of
research, is removed from libraries or is published with their names
expunged.
When the physica] chemists Veniamin G. Levicn, a corresponding
member of the Academy of Sciences, applied to emigrate to Israel in
1972, he was not merely removed from his Institute post, five scientific
committees and two editorial boards; the chair he held at Moscow State
University was abolished.
Moreover, in virtually every similar case, the response of
colleagues has been silence. A number of scientists interviewed
attribute this more to the prevailing system of rewards than to fears of
repression. Orthodox scientists reap escalating benefits that place
them among the elite materially as well as intellectually, and these and
their careers could be threatened if they goit involved.
&amp;quot;Under Stalin it was a question of life or death,&amp;quot; said
Dr. Levich&apos;s wife, Tanya. &amp;quot;Now it has become a question of being
allowed to go abroad for a longer period.&amp;quot;
The Soviet Communist Party chief, Leonid T. Brezhnev, defined the
code of behavior at the Academy of Sciences&apos; 250th anniversary
celebration last October: &amp;quot;Whatever the field in which Soviet scientists
are working, they are always distinguished by one characteristic--a high
standard of Communist consciousness and Soviet patriOtism.&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995781">
Less Than Factory Wage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989764">
The primary incentive is built into a pay scale that rises sharply
with promotions. A Soviet physicist outlineilt this way: Wile a junior
scientist fresh from the university earns only 100 rubles a month--
about S130--or 40 rubles less than the average industrial wage, the
salary of a senior scientist jumps to 300 rubles a month, and a
laboratory chief or full professor earns 500, plus the opportunity to
draw more by teaching or writing on the side.
Upon election to the Academy of Sciences, there is an additional
stipend of 500 rubles for full members, who also get such benefits as
chauffeur-driven cars, and 250 rubles for corresponding members.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.597067">

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995419">
The promotions do not involve scientific ability alone. Also
involved is &amp;quot;obshchestvennaya aktivnost,&amp;quot; which translates—somewhat
misleaaingly--as &amp;quot;social activity,&amp;quot; that is, activity on behalf of party
and state.
The assessment begins in the university, where Young Communist
League activists are entitled to higher scholarship stipends. The same
criterion is applied to admission to work toward advanced degrees. &amp;quot;If
you want a doctorate you could be Isaac Newton himself, but if you don&apos;t
have your political activity, you will never get a doctorate,&amp;quot; said
Valentin F. Turchin, a physicist who earned his before becoming a
dissident.
Similar evaluations are made for job assignments. Dr. Levich
recalls that when he visited his institute&apos;s party organizations with
recommendations for promotions among his staff, &amp;quot;the first auestion was
their social behavior and whether they were party members.&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.953272">
Travel Most Valued
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99702344">
The most valued privilege is the opportunity to travel abroad,
where a scientist can learn firsthand what foreigners are doing in his
field. The right to travel is dispensed only to those who are examined
and Bound trustworthy. Political and social nonconformity, even contact
with dissidents on or off the job, is reason enough for the refusal.
According to one Soviet scientist who has traveled abroad, the
crucial document is a kharakteristika, or character reference, from
one&apos;s institute. While the applicant may be questioned by the regional
party committee; it is the obscure &amp;quot;departure commission&amp;quot; of the Central
Committee that dispenses final approval.
Vefore a scientist leaves he is instructed by party officials how
to behave. Upon his return, he must prepare a written report on what he
did and whom he saw. Eventually, he is considered cleared for repeated
tripe abroad or as Russian slang puts it, &amp;quot;in the clip&amp;quot; like a pistol
bullet.
If doubts arise, the travel privilege can be revoked. A scientist
who visited Czechoslovakia in the late 1960&apos;s said that he was forbidden
to go abroad for several years after a colleague reported that he had
become too friendly with their hosts.
Scientists who get in trouble politically can also cast a shadow on
superiors and coworkers. Institutes with nonconformists on their staffs
may find it harder to compete for project funds or foreign-made
laboratory equipment. Since administrators have a vested interest in
maintaining ideological respectability, retaliation against someone
stepping out of line need not he instigated by higher authority.

Professional Setbacks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974706761904762">
Dissident scientists say they have suffered professionally under
such political constraints. Dr. Turchin believes that the system&apos;s
inflexibility explains at least in part why the Soviet Union still lags
behind the West technologically. Others have noted that Soviet science
excels in abstract fields like pure mathematics and astronomy but
becomes weaker in applied fields, particularly if they touch upon
ideology, as the social sciences do.
A Western scientist familiar with the Soviet scene believes that
Moscow has compensated by drawing on vast numbers of applicants and is
filling gaps through scientific exchange with the West. Moreover, he
commented, Western scientists have not been significantly bolder in
jeopardizing their careers.
Some Soviet scientists, like the physicist Pyotr L. Kapitsa, have
become so internationally respected as to stay aloof from political
pressures. Dr. Kapitsa declined to join the denunciation campaign
against Dr. Sakharov, also a physicist, with no apparent ill effect. A
few others, Dr. Sakharov among them, have broken with the system, but
most scientists prefer to go along.
&amp;quot;A lot of them may have sympathy for the dissidents,&amp;quot; the Western
scientific observer said, &amp;quot;but they wouldn&apos;t do anything to support them
because it would risk a comfortable life.&amp;quot;

Soviet Dismissal of Igor Melchuk
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.941098222222222">
Your Moscow correspondent, Robert Toth, at the beginning of June
reported that Igor Melchuk, &amp;quot;the most outstanding Soviet linguist,&amp;quot; had
been dismissed from the Institute of Linguistics of the U.S.S.R.
Academy of Sciences. He had failed to pass a recertification (which is
held once in five years) and lost his position as senior research
associate for his political, so TOth asserts, &amp;quot;nonconformism.&amp;quot;
It is true, Igor Melchuk had published slanderous statements in the
Western press. But, supposing this was the inotivpOon behind the
decision of the institute&apos;s administration, as Tab alleges, we may ask:

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.588905">

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998887090909091">
How is it that Melchuk was able to work at the institute for as
many as 20 years? Why were dozens of his books and articles published
in the U.S.S.R., and why was the scientific degree of candidate of
science conferred On him? Why was Melchuk not dismissed much earlier--
five or 10 years ago?
Here is comment by Dr. Victoria Yartseva, director of the
institute: &amp;quot;We had always condemned the actions of Igor Melchuk, but
never raised the question of his leaving the institute. We considered
Melcbuk to be an able scientist. Be was given a concrete sector of
research--the development of an Anglo-Russian machine translation
system. The project is of enormous importance. However, his
investigations throughout these years did not lead to practical results.
The project is very far from completion.&amp;quot;
The learned council of the Institute of Linguistics, by a majority
of votes (the voting was secret) did not re-elect Melchuk for a new
five-year period.
It is known that in the West applied research is conducted within
the framework of fairly rigid programs, the financing of which depends
on the results- obteined. Clearly, there they would not have kept for so
many years a man violating the terms of a contract.
Igor Melchuk was dismissed from his position not because of his
views, but because of the neglect of the job entrusted to him.

<bodyText confidence="0.927701823529412">
Our journal once dedicated to statistical methods in
linguistics has successively widened its scope and from 1977
onwards the scope will be officially defined as computational
linguistics in general.
As we see it, this is a study where the emphasis is on
derivation of linguistic results--numerical as in statistical
work and/or non-numerical as in algebraical syntax--by applying
strict rules.
The essence of computational linguistics is not the employ-
ment of a computer--a computational study may be performed
manually as in statistical analysis.
To make the distinction clearer between computational
linguistics and the technique for computation within linguistics,
we shall prefer the term &amp;quot;linguistic calculus&amp;quot;
In order to cater for this widened scope SMIL shall from
1977 onwards be published 4 times a year, starting March 1977

&apos;No Logical Technical Boundary&apos; Between Computing and Communications

<bodyText confidence="0.981975818181818">
Summarizing the technical presentations
at the FCC Planning Conference on Computer
Communications, Dr. Vinton G. Cerf of the
Information Processing Technique Office,
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
(ARPA), noted (1) there is no &amp;quot;logical
technical boundary&amp;quot; between computing and
communications, (2) packet switching is
having an &amp;quot;important effect&amp;quot; on computer
communications today, and will have a
&amp;quot;profound effect&amp;quot; on frequency allocation
in the future, (3) high local access costs,
international link costs, and user learn-
ing costs are &amp;quot;limiting&amp;quot; the growth of
computer communications services, (4) the
prime opportunities for network cost and
tariff improvement lie in the development
of new facilities for local access and for
intercontinental links, and (5) a regula-
tory climate is needed &amp;quot;which encourages
innovation, ensures reliable interconnec-
tion of primary services, and promotes
the acquisition of capital •for growth.&amp;quot;
Opening the Conference, FCC chairman
Richard Wiley stated his view that a com-
puter is a communications device, not a
data processing device when it is used in
a traditional communications service. How-
ever, Wiley also noted that the use of
computer technology may result in an en-
hanced service, offering more than tradi-
tional communications.
He predicted that similar technological
forces will develop in several areas of
communications service. Wiley said, &amp;quot;I
firmly believe that, in this great free
enterprise society of ours, government
regulations must not be permitted to stand
in the way of technological development.
If the new technology creates administra-
tive difficulties for the government, it
is the regulations that must be conformed
and not the technology.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Computer Communications: An Introduction
and Overview,&amp;quot; Lynn Hopewell (chairman,
IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on
Computer Communications; member, executive
staff, Computer Sciences Corp.) said that
computer communications systems had first
been used in controlling &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot; operations
of industry and government. Hopewell added
that the most common use of computer communi-
cations is in data base applications.

The speaker suggested that the computer
communications industry accounts for 20
percent of all expenditures in-the computer
field. Examples of industrial areas affect-
44
d by computer communications technology
ere listed as law enforcement, securities
rokerage, insurance, reservations systems,
nd banking. Hopewell said that 75 per-
ent of the top 500 industry corporations
re now using computer communications.
While distributing samples of a micro-
:omputer on a chip to the audience, Hope-
veil noted that technological changes
have produced a 1976 microcomputer CPU
costing $20 in contrast to a 1960 IBM
CPU costing $30,000. He added that micro-
processors which cost $20 today cost $100
only a year ago. He indicated that such
differentials represent only the beginning
of low cost computing.
Hopewell said that the proposed defini-
tions employed in the new &amp;quot;Computer Inquiry&amp;quot;
aid in &amp;quot;clarifying the permitted uses of
computers by common carriers, but in no
way allow the proposed abandonment&apos; of the
&apos;hybrid&apos; service concept.&amp;quot; He noted that
the hybrid concept thould be retained
&amp;quot;because some service offerings have
mixes of both computing and communications
functions,&amp;quot; not retained because of unclear
definitions.
Since &amp;quot;hybrid services will become even
more common in the future,&amp;quot; Hopewell con-
tinued, elimination of the hybrid concept
will &amp;quot;inevitably suppress innovation be-
cause any services that have communications
functions inextricably bound into them will
be defined as subject to regulation.&amp;quot; The
speaker concluded that he saw no &amp;quot;techno-
logical or economic reason for the regu-
lation of the resale industry.&amp;quot;
In his presentation on &amp;quot;Research Topics
in Computer Communication,&amp;quot; Vinton Cerf
summarized technological factors influ-
encing the development of computer com-
munications: the availability of wideband
transmission media; the use of computers
to control the switching and allocation of
transmission bandwidth; the trend toward
all-digital telephone networks; and inter-
connection of computer communications net-
works.
Cerf said the &amp;quot;technology is leading away
from separate, distinct narrowband services
...toward integrated wideband services. The
potential social impact is pervasive; the
possibilities for new wealth-creating ac-
tivity, almost incalculable; and the need
for regulatory adjustment, inevitable.&amp;quot;
With the juxtaposition of computing and
communication, he suggested that the FCC
could reallocate the radio spectrum using
computer-controlled demand access; mandate
computer communication network interconnec-
tion through the enforcement of interconnec-
tion standards; and consider propCsals by
regulated carriers as well as others &amp;quot;to
provide previously impossible combinations
of information processing and traditional
communication services.&amp;quot;
In his presentation on the &amp;quot;Dimension
of the Need for Computer Communications,&amp;quot;
Alex Curran, president, BNR, Inc., suggested
that domestic users must seek tO reduce the
cost of network access for smaller users,
especially in the &amp;quot;smaller urban centers.&amp;quot;
FCC Interconnection Chief Louis Feidner,
in a question-and-answer period following
Curran&apos;s presentation, stressed the &amp;quot;need
for computer power&amp;quot; in rural areas.
In his formal presentation, curran con-
tinued that the cost of intercontinental
transmission must also be reduced. Accord-
ing to the speaker, these measures would
help to insure that &amp;quot;the common carrier
networks can cope with the data communica-
tions traffic of commercial users.&amp;quot;
Curran stated that some of the office
and home services associated with computer
45
communications could require reintegration
of voice and data capabilities. Curran
provided several current examples of per-
sonal computing including: Viewdata, the
embryonic electron ix: newspaper in the
United Kingdom; Incasting, instantaneous
voting and data collection in Canada;
Mailgram, a precursor of electronic mail
in the U.S.,; and CAI, computer-assisted
instruction.
Curran also said that other services will
require switching machines &amp;quot;capable of rec-
ognizing information interest specifications
as valid addresses.&amp;quot; For example, switch-
ing machines could recognize selective in-
formation dissemination [interest] specifi-
cations as valid addresses. Curran concluded,
&amp;quot;Thus, the boundary between communicating
and computing will become more blurred.
There are economic arguments for suggesting
that the boundary definitions be relaxed to
encourage a new cycle of innovation.&amp;quot;
In his presentation entitled, &amp;quot;Limita-
tions on the Growth of Computer-Communica-
tion Services,&amp;quot; Professor Donald A. Dunn,
Engineering Economic Systems Department,
Stanford University, indicated that user
learning costs will limit the rate at which
new computer communication services can be
introduced to markets serving non-computer
professionals. Dunn suggested that, in
future regulatory decision, integrated ser-
vice packages (designed to minimize user
learning and operation costs) might be
used as the unit of service that is judged
communications or data processing in lieu
of individual component services. He added
that regulatory limitations on the rate of
return and regulatory policies on deprecia-
tion allowances can restrict technological
changes as well as limit the rate of intro-
duction of new equipment by carriers.
According to the speaker, the earlier
&amp;quot;Computer Inquiry&amp;quot; rule, requiring data
processing services to be provided by car-
riers through a separate affiliate, may
limit the growth of carriers. But he added
that the rule does not limit the growth of
the data processing industry since unregu-
lated suppliers can respond to this market.
Dunn also noted that the resale and sharing
decision, Imposing regulation on resale car-
riers, would not necessarily inhibit the
growth of the industry &amp;quot;since separate data
processing affiliates will not be required
of resale carriers that do not provide
monopoly services.&amp;quot;
He stated that the resale and sharing
decision &amp;quot;removed some of the most serious
limits to the growth of this industry by
opening the market for network services to
essentially any firm willing to operate as
a resale carrier.&amp;quot; Dunn concluded, &amp;quot;Pres-
sures are likely to develop soon to regu-
late providers of information service pack-
ages that may offer computer message ser-
vices to users that obtain network service
from resale carriers. Such regulation
would inhibit the growth of the industry,
and is not needed to protect the interests
of users.&amp;quot;
In their presentation on &amp;quot;The Future of
Computer Communications,&amp;quot; Vinton Cerf and
Alex Curran said that &amp;quot;we cannot offer a
solution to the definition of a boundary
between communicating and computing -- in
fact, technical considerations convince us
that there is no natural boundary.&amp;quot;
Cerf and Curran urged the FCC to support
the development of &amp;quot;competitive services;&amp;quot;
insure that a &amp;quot;sufficient set&amp;quot; of standards
is created to facilitate interconnection of
&amp;quot;prime services:&amp;quot; create a climate in which
both computing and carrier interests profit
from the installation of &amp;quot;reliable&amp;quot; facili-
ties; and broaden the base for the acqui-
sition of capital so as to eliminate a
possible constraint on growth.

First, an overall characterization of the book It is an out-
standing work. Time may well establish it as a masterpiece Salton
has succeeded in combining. (1) the presentation of an interesting
and, more importantly, a challenging concept--the &amp;quot;dynamic library&amp;quot;
--taward which he believes libraries and information agencies
ought to direct their research, developmental, and organizational
efforts, (2) extensive guides to the relevant literature in several
fields, through late 1974, (3) a textbook for at least two semester-
length courses, for which my suggested titles would be &amp;quot;Language
Processing for Information Storage and Retrieval&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Library
Systems Analysis&amp;quot;, plus a good part of a third semester on &amp;quot;Library
Automation&amp;quot;, and (4) an invaluable reference work for computational
kinguists, information scientists, and librarians.
REVIEW. DYNAMIC INFORMATION AND LIBRARY PROCESSING 49
Now to the details. Since this review is being prepared for
the American Journal of Computational Linguistics, it will be pre-
sented in a somewhat unusual format. Instead of beginning at the
beginning of the book, I shall start by discussing what seem to me
to be the book&apos;s highlights for the computational linguist Only
after that discussion shall I deal with the general plan of the
book and with other specific parts of it
The book&apos;s ten chapters are intended to be capable of being
read independently of one another, although most readers will want
to peruse Chapter 1 ahead of any other in order to understand
Salton&apos;s underlying theme for the book Of the ten chapters, those
most immediately relevant to computational linguistics are undoubt-
edly the last two, plus Chapter 3. The last two are part of a
section called &amp;quot;Dynamic Information Processing,&amp;quot; in which Salton
connects basic concepts in file organization and language processing
with their potential applications in the dynamic library (about
which more is said below) At the heart of computational linguistics
Chapter 9, &amp;quot;Language Processing,&amp;quot; condenses into 49 pages a frank
evaluative review of the state-of-the-art in this field Salton
links the research in the field with its potential for applications
to information systems by saying:
A content analysis system going beyond the identification of indi-
vidual terms . . . requires at least three parts: a description of an
area of &apos;discourse in terms of basic entities, or concepts, of import-
ance in this area, including also the main logical-semantic relation-
ships that must be identified between these entities; a linguistic

theory based on appropriate characterizations of lexical items and on
grammatical and semantic rbles that would underlie the language ana-
lysis system; a set of procedures capable of generating for each
acceptable input string a deep structure specifying the linguistic-
semantic relations between entities obtained from the linguistic
analysis, as well as the logical-semantic relations derived from the
encyclopedia.
With the stage thus set, Salton presents a moderately detailed and
highly readable overview of recent and current approaches to natural-
language analysis, with an ample supply of examples The chapter&apos;s
bibliography can serve as a list of the highlights in computational
linguistics during 1963-1973 Not everyone will agree with Salton&apos;s
somewhat pessimistic view of the usefulness of computational lin-
guistics for information systems in the near future (i e , 10-20
years), but all will find this chapter a masterful presentation
In Chapters 3 and 10, Salton enlarges the horizons of compu-
tational linguistics beyond its most frequent area of concern, for
whcih one might better use the narrpwer name of &amp;quot;algebraic linguis-
tics&amp;quot;, by discussing what I like to call &amp;quot;quantitative linguistics&amp;quot;
--another part of computational linguistics, broadly considered
Chapter 3, &amp;quot;Automatic Indexing and Abstracting&amp;quot;, treats methods by
which it is possible to assess programmatically the probable use-
fulness of worcN and phrases as indicators of the content of docu-
ments. Such methods are primarily, but by no means exclusively,
statistical, and the discussion includes syntax-analytic methods
Salton takes pains to dispose of the standard criticism of automatic
indexing as &amp;quot;imperfect&amp;quot;, by arguing that

The contents indicate that Dr. Mel&apos;cuk has been fired from his position as Senior Research Fellow of the Institute of Linguistics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The motivation for this action is ascribed to a letter, published in the New York Times on 26 January 1976, in which he criticized Soviet actions against Andrei Sakharov an Sergei Kovalev. Dr. Mel&apos;cuk asked me to make the information about his dismissal to American scientists. On I have written to a number of relevant periodicals asking them to publish his letter: The Cammattee of the Association for Linguistics considered this request and decided that the letter should be published, along with other relevant material, in The Finite String. Accordingly, I am attaching, in order, a copy of the letter he transmitted to me, dated 16 May 3976; the original New York Times letter of 26 January a short item in the March York Times describing his firing; a letter to the editor in the 10 April New York Times from Chomsky and Evers expressing their concern; two articles, one by Robert Toth published in the 2 June 1976 Los Angeles Times and one by Christopher Wren published in the 36 June 3976 New York Times; and a letter to the editor by Igor Ttoyanovsky, a Soviet journalist, published in the Los Angeles Times on 7 August 1976, which presents the Soviet view of the action taken against Mel&apos;cuk.

Yartseva, the director);* &amp;quot;slandering against our country I.A. Mel&apos;cuk does serious harm not only to it but also to all mankind.., so that his hostile action impossible further presence of I. Mel&apos;cuk in the Institute of Linguistics&amp;quot; (M.

Eliseev, the assistant directoi); &amp;quot;the position of T. Mel&apos;cuk borders on war propaganda,... and all his behavior produces a very bad impression: we hoped to hear words of repent but what we actually heard is a firm conviction (N. Gadzieva), etc. Those speeches were summed up in the second address by V. Yartseva: &amp;quot;The world is split in two, and I. A. Mel&apos;cuk turns for help to our enemies!&amp;quot; It should be emphasized that in the Institute where I have worked for almost 20 years and where I thought I had enough friends since I with many not professional but human relations a long time, there no one who wold side with or at least say few words in my favor. More than that: as far as I know, no of the Soviet scientists (my personal friends excluded) found it possible or necessary to defend me in some form they would consider appropriate. purely political character of my makes it practically for me to another job in USSR--the so even the decision by Faculty my in the Soviet science was a difficult one. severe] years I have had no possibility to publish my The quotations given a tape during the above which is my possession. Letters concerning Igor Mel&apos;chuk 11 papers in leading Soviet linguistic journals. (The appearance of each of my papers required no less than a heroic deed on the part of some member of editorial board). The secood volume of my monograph TOward a Theory of Linguistic Models of the Meaning&lt;=&gt;Text Type (the product of years of painstaking work) waited publication more than 8 years and failed to be, aftet all, published. I was and am forbidden to teach, to take part in many scientific conventions, to go abroad for contacts with Western colleagues. Immediately after the appearance of my letter in The New York Times Soviet linguistic periodicals and houses began suppressing to my &apos;works, acknowledgements by other authors mentioring my name (e.g. Serge° Fokin, head of the editorial of Naucnotexniceskaja informacija, National Institute of Technological Information--VINITI, Moscow) and even my name as the editor or translator (as did Prof. Nikolaj S. Cemodanov and Klavdija T. Bogdanova of the Progress publishers). Under such conditions and having no permanent job I am left without the least possibility for normal continuation of my linguistic research. Which amounts to putting me before a tragic choice: either a meaningless existence in my country, which needs not my work and effort, or emigration meaning the lifelong separation (such is the Stiviet law) from my native land as well as from my relatives, friends, and colleagues. I understand quite clearly that my situation cannot even be compered with the terrible lot of those people who, deprived of their freedom, are serving their terms in Soviet prisons and labor camps For political reasons and whose health and perhaps life are in danger. But still I feel I have the moral right to address the public opinion since is not my personality that is of importance here. My is but a modest yet very vivid illustration of the moral life of the top layer of intellectual society--of what be known as the famous Russian intelligentsia. It is an additional touch to the monstrous chronicle of felonies and base toadyism which were and are so easily in USSR many persons holding scientific degrees and often posts of responsibility in the Soviet science hierarchy. The aim of th)e letter is too make its readers seriously ponder once again over the fate of Soviet scholars and scientists Forced to choose between low-down behavior and emigration. (Bright times now! not so long ago they had to choose between felony and a bullet or, in the best case, years behind the barbed Wire). Do not Forget, please, that each of them with the exclusion of a few active militants like Andrej D. Saxarov or Igor R. Safarevic is either a victim, or a hangman, or--which is perhaps the most dangeromo thinq--a tacit accomplice of hangmen. I.A. mel&apos;cuk</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.997042578947369">MOSCOW—On the face of it, the scientific council of the Institute of Linguistics of the Soviet Academy of Science was meeting to review the work of a senior researcher before his recertification to his post. Normally it would be a matter of form. the senior scientist—Igor Alexandrovich Melchuk, said by U.S. and Soviet linguists to be the best in his field-awas being tried behind closed doors for political nonconformity. The secretly taped proceedings of March 25 show what criteria his judges used. A transcript of the tape has been obtained by The Los Angeles Times and its authenticity has been verified. &amp;quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if your [scientific) theories are successful or not,&amp;quot; declared one council member. &amp;quot;Scientific and political positions are not of the same importance.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Mistakes in scientific work are one thing, but ideological mistakes,&amp;quot; insisted another, &amp;quot;are quite another thing. They are simply awful... and must be judged most harshly.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Fklaluating the work of a Soviet scientist cannot be narrowly said citing official rules for certifying scientists that require &amp;quot;definite political and moral standards as well.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Igor. Alexandrovich is trying to claim that it is a personal matter, thir statement against Soviet ideology,&amp;quot; said a fourth. &amp;quot;That is impermissible.&amp;quot; And 90 it went, focusing on his political faults and virtually his capabilities. Melchuk, 43, who has been compared to the outstanding U.S. linguist Noam Chomsky, was fired from the institute. His books were to be withdrawn from libraries. Other footnoting his must be revised. knew well the limits of permitted in the Soviet system and he stepped beyond them. His career has been marked both by academic brilliance and his personal relationships. &amp;quot;Outspoken,&amp;quot; admitted friend; &amp;quot;impudent,&amp;quot; complained a judge. trouble entering school despite a straight-A at university. His graduate advisor was fired for associating with the late Nobel laureate Boris Pasternak, the dissident 7 concernlng Igor author, and Melchuk wrote a letter to the higher education ministry defending the professor. He then left graduate study to work on language translation by A series of articles on the sublect earned a candidate degree (between masters and doctors) in an unprecedented recognition of his abilities. he not permitted to defend his doctorate thesis, for by time he had signed other One had asked &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; for dissidents Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavski in 1966; another the 3968 Soviet invasion Czechoslovakia. Then he recanted. &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; Me3chuk acknowledged during the March trial. &amp;quot;I expressed my regret for past statements. Frankly, I did so only because I was I acted cowardly. But I&apos;m tired of fear. I no more fear.&amp;quot; recanting done him good. At least seven times 1071 and 1975, the transcript shows, he was allowed to abriad to scientific conferences, when the offered to pay his way. &amp;quot;We did not send Igor Alexandrovich abroad,&amp;quot; said Victoria N. institute director, &amp;quot;because Soviet scientists represents our system and our Soviet ideology abroad, and Igor Alexandrovich always emphasizes: &apos;It&apos;s mine, it is my personal Igor Alexandrovich is with or is with them.&amp;quot; Professionally, Melchuk had more than 150 publications to his credit in 20 years. A West German publishing house offered in 1971 to his major work, &amp;quot;Sense:Text,&amp;quot; but the linguistic institute refused permission. The first volume of that work appeared here in 1974 but the second half, which should have appeared simultaneously, still has not come out and is now badly outdate:a. ranges from the of and language origins to information and communication theory and learning. Melchuk&apos;s book, said an American linguist who read it all, &amp;quot;is a masterpiece of and it been published promptly when written ... would have been a classic, if not a bible, of linguistic theory. It is an ambitious and explicit attempt to, integrate the Soviet analytical approach and the American descriptiva approach at a time when synthesis of the two is in the air.&amp;quot; 8 Letters concerning Igor Melrchuk 16 Another American linguist said, &amp;quot;He has not blazed new frontiers in the sense that Chomsky has. On the other hand Melchuk is by far the best Soviet linguist.&amp;quot; Melchuk abandoned his several-year public silence with a letter to the New York Times defending Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov. It appeared January 25. &amp;quot;I am not allowed to . express my opinions in the U.S.S.R.,&amp;quot; he wrote. Many Soviets &amp;quot;strongly disapprove the dirty campaign&amp;quot; against Sakharov who is &amp;quot;perhaps the last honest scientist&amp;quot; here, he continued. of the science academy were &amp;quot;soulless puppets,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;A powerful nation of 250 million, guided by the unscrupulous and having at its disposal first-class brains with no hearts, may prove highly dangerous,&amp;quot; he warned. Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Vietnam and Angola show Western impotence, he concluded. Whatever its merits, that letter apparently had not been read by any of Melchuk&apos;s judges. A voice from the audience, from which &amp;quot;outsiders&amp;quot; were barred, asked to know its contents. The institute&apos;s deputy director replied that he had not seen ft. &amp;quot;but so far as I know it is written in support of Sakharov and reduces to three points,&amp;quot; which recounted accurately. Melchuk then to read and discuss the letter with anyone, but only after the council&apos;s decision on his future. &amp;quot;I consider it impermissible to mix the question of my recertification with my letter. He cited a United Nations resolution of 1966, ratified by the Soviet Union and incorporated into Soviet law, that guarantees the freedom of expression, within a state or across borders. institute deputy director Yuri S. Eliseev countered that rules scientists set political as well as scientific standards, and he brushed off&apos; the international treaty. of Melchuk rose in pitch toward end of the session. mistakes, said trade union member of the scientific council, &amp;quot;must be judged most harshly ...

Consequently, Mr. Melchuk was discharged. &amp;quot;The whole session was a monstrous farce,&amp;quot; the 43-year old linguist related. &amp;quot;I worked at the for 20 years and published books and papers. And one there had the courage to stand up and say a kind word about me.&amp;quot; 10 Letters concernang Igor Mel&apos;chuk 18 Political Reliability The case highlights the priorities set by the Soviet scientific which the Soviet Union says, has a of the world&apos;s scientists. Their advancement depends on political reliability as well as curiousity. The price for running the political grain is stiff. Scientists showing signs of dissidence are promptly of prestige and their work, perhaps based years of is removed libraries or is published with their names expunged. When the physica] chemists Veniamin G. Levicn, a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences, applied to emigrate to Israel in 1972, he was not merely removed from his Institute post, five scientific and two editorial boards; he held Moscow State University was abolished. Moreover, in virtually every similar case, the response of colleagues has been silence. A number of scientists interviewed attribute this more to the prevailing system of rewards than to fears of repression. Orthodox scientists reap escalating benefits that place them among the elite materially as well as intellectually, and these and their careers could be threatened if they goit involved. Stalin was question of life or death,&amp;quot; said Dr. Levich&apos;s wife, Tanya. &amp;quot;Now it has become a question of being allowed to go abroad for a longer period.&amp;quot; The Soviet Communist Party chief, Leonid T. Brezhnev, defined the code of behavior at the Academy of Sciences&apos; 250th anniversary last &amp;quot;Whatever field in which Soviet scientists are working, they are always distinguished by one characteristic--a high of Communist and Less Than Factory Wage primary incentive is into pay scale that rises with promotions. A Soviet physicist outlineilt this way: Wile a junior the university earns only 100 rubles a month-- S130--or rubles less than the average industrial wage, the of a senior jumps to 300 rubles a month, and a laboratory chief or full professor earns 500, plus the opportunity to by or the side. Upon election to the Academy of Sciences, there is an additional stipend of 500 rubles for full members, who also get such benefits as cars, 250 rubles for corresponding 11 Letters concerning Igor Melfchuk 19 The promotions do not involve scientific ability alone. Also involved is &amp;quot;obshchestvennaya aktivnost,&amp;quot; which translates—somewhat misleaaingly--as &amp;quot;social activity,&amp;quot; that is, activity on behalf of party and state. assessment begins in where Young Communist League activists are entitled to higher scholarship stipends. The same is applied to to work toward degrees. &amp;quot;If want a doctorate could be Isaac Newton himself, but if you don&apos;t your political activity, you will a doctorate,&amp;quot; said a physicist who earned his before becoming a dissident. Similar evaluations are made for job assignments. Dr. Levich recalls that when he visited his institute&apos;s party organizations with recommendations for promotions among his staff, &amp;quot;the first auestion was social behavior and whether were party members.&amp;quot; Travel Most Valued most valued privilege is the opportunity to travel a scientist learn what foreigners are doing in his The right to travel is dispensed only to those are and Bound trustworthy. Political and social nonconformity, even contact dissidents on or off the job, is for the refusal. According to one Soviet scientist who has traveled abroad, the crucial document is a kharakteristika, or character reference, from one&apos;s institute. While the applicant may be questioned by the regional it is the obscure &amp;quot;departure commission&amp;quot; of the Central Committee that dispenses final approval. Vefore a scientist leaves he is instructed by party officials how to behave. Upon his return, he must prepare a written report on what he and whom saw. Eventually, he is cleared for repeated tripe abroad or as Russian slang puts it, &amp;quot;in the clip&amp;quot; like a pistol bullet. If doubts arise, the travel privilege can be revoked. A scientist who visited Czechoslovakia in the late 1960&apos;s said that he was forbidden go abroad for several years a reported he had too friendly with their Scientists who get in trouble politically can also cast a shadow on and coworkers. nonconformists on staffs may find it harder to compete for project funds or foreign-made laboratory equipment. Since administrators have a vested interest in ideological retaliation someone stepping out of line need not he instigated by higher authority. 12 Letters concerning Igor Melichuk 20 Professional Setbacks scientists say they have suffered political constraints. Dr. believes that the system&apos;s inflexibility explains at least in part why the Soviet Union still lags the West Others have noted Soviet science in abstract fields like pure astronomy but becomes weaker in applied fields, particularly if they touch upon ideology, as the social sciences do.

Why were dozens of his books and articles published the U.S.S.R., and why was degree of candidate of science conferred On him? Why was Melchuk not dismissed much earlier-five or 10 years ago? Here is comment by Dr. Victoria Yartseva, director of the institute: &amp;quot;We had always condemned the actions of Igor Melchuk, but never raised the question of his leaving the institute. We considered Melcbuk to be an able scientist. Be was given a concrete sector of development of an Anglo-Russian translation The project is of enormous importance. throughout years did not lead to results. project is very from completion.&amp;quot; The learned council of the Institute of Linguistics, by a majority of votes (the voting was secret) did not re-elect Melchuk for a new five-year period. is known that in the West is conducted within the framework of fairly rigid programs, the financing of which depends on the resultsobteined.

<abstract confidence="0.907718954545455">Summarizing the technical presentations at the FCC Planning Conference on Computer Communications, Dr. Vinton G. Cerf of the Information Processing Technique Office, Advanced Research Projects (ARPA), noted (1) there is no &amp;quot;logical technical boundary&amp;quot; between computing and communications, (2) packet switching is having an &amp;quot;important effect&amp;quot; on computer communications today, and will have a &amp;quot;profound effect&amp;quot; on frequency allocation in the future, (3) high local access costs, international link costs, and user learning costs are &amp;quot;limiting&amp;quot; the growth of computer communications services, (4) the prime opportunities for network cost and tariff improvement lie in the development of new facilities for local access and for intercontinental links, and (5) a regulatory climate is needed &amp;quot;which encourages innovation, ensures reliable interconnection of primary services, and promotes the acquisition of capital •for growth.&amp;quot; Opening the Conference, FCC chairman Richard Wiley stated his view that a computer is a communications device, not a data processing device when it is used in a traditional communications service. However, Wiley also noted that the use of computer technology may result in an enhanced service, offering more than traditional communications. He predicted that similar technological forces will develop in several areas of communications service. Wiley said, &amp;quot;I firmly believe that, in this great free enterprise society of ours, government must not be permitted to in the way of technological development. If the new technology creates administrative difficulties for the government, it is the regulations that must be conformed and not the technology.&amp;quot; In the Conference&apos;s first presentation on</abstract>
