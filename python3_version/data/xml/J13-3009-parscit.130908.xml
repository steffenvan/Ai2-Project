With the increasing rate of patent application filings, automated patent classification is of rising
economic importance. This article investigates how patent classification can be improved by
using different representations of the patent documents. Using the Linguistic Classification
System (LCS), we compare the impact of adding statistical phrases (in the form of bigrams)
and linguistic phrases (in two different dependency formats) to the standard bag-of-words text
representation on a subset of 532,264 English abstracts from the CLEF-IP 2010 corpus. In
contrast to previous findings on classification with phrases in the Reuters-21578 data set, for
patent classification the addition of phrases results in significant improvements over the unigram
baseline. The best results were achieved by combining all four representations, and the second
best by combining unigrams and lemmatized bigrams. This article includes extensive analyses of
the class models (a.k.a. class profiles) created by the classifiers in the LCS framework, to examine
which types of phrases are most informative for patent classification. It appears that bigrams
contribute most to improvements in classification accuracy. Similar experiments were performed
on subsets of French and German abstracts to investigate the generalizability of these findings.

are struggling to manage (Benzineb and Guyot 2011). To speed up the examination
process, a patent application needs to be directed to patent examiners specialized
in the subfield(s) of that particular patent as quickly as possible (Smith 2002). This
preclassification is done automatically in most patent offices, but substantial addi-
tional manual labor is still necessary. Furthermore, since 2010, the International Patent
Classification1 (IPC) is revised every year to keep track of recent developments in the
various subdomains. Such a revision is followed by a reclassification of portions of
the existing patent corpus, which is currently done mainly by hand by the national
patent offices (Held, Schellner, and Ota 2011). Both preclassification and reclassification
could be improved, and a higher consistency of the classifications of the documents
in the patent corpus could be obtained, if more reliable and precise automatic text
classification algorithms were available (Benzineb and Guyot 2011).
Most approaches to text classification use the bag-of-words (BOW) text representa-
tion, which represents each document by the words that occur in it, irrespective of their
ordering in the original document. In the last decades much research has gone into
expanding this representation with additional information, such as statistical phrases2
(n-grams) or some forms of syntactic or semantic knowledge. Even though (statistical)
phrases are more representative units for classes than single words (Caropreso, Matwin,
and Sebastiani 2001), they are so sparsely distributed that they have limited impact
during the classification process. Therefore, it is not surprising that the best scoring
multi-class, multi-label3 classification results for the well-known Reuters-21578 data set
have been obtained using a BOW representation (Bekkerman and Allan 2003). But the
limited contribution of phrases in addition to the BOW-representation does not seem
to hold for all classification tasks: ¨Ozg¨ur and G¨ung¨or (2010) found significant differ-
ences in the impact of linguistic phrases between short newswire texts (Reuters-21578),
scientific abstracts (NSF), and informal posts in usenet groups (MiniNg): Especially the
classification of scientific abstracts could be improved by using phrases as index terms.
In a follow-up study, ¨Ozg¨ur and G¨ung¨or (2012) found that for the three different data
sets, different types of linguistic phrases have most impact. The authors conclude that
more formal text types benefit from more complex syntactic dependencies.
In this article, we investigate if similar improvements can be found for patent
classification and, more specifically, which types of phrases are most effective for this
particular task. In this article we investigate the value of phrases for classification by
comparing the improvements that can be gained from extending the BOW representa-
tion with (1) statistical phrases (in the form of bigrams); (2) linguistic phrases originating
from the Stanford parser (see Section 3.2.2); (3) aboutness-based4 linguistic phrases from
the AEGIR parser (Section 3.2.3); and (4) a combination of all of these. Furthermore, we
will investigate the importance of different syntactic relations for the classification task,
1 The IPC is a complex hierarchical classification system comprising sections, classes, subclasses, and
groups. For example, the “A42B 1/12” class label, which groups designs for bathing caps, falls under
section A “Human necessities,” class 42 “Headzear,” subclass B “Head coverings,” group 1 “Hats; caps;
hoods.” The latest edition of the IPC contains eight sections, 129 classes, 639 subclasses, 7,352 groups,
and 61,847 subgroups. The IPC covers inventions in all technological fields in which inventions can
be patented.

2 By a phrase we mean an index unit consisting of two or more words, generated through either syntactic
or statistical methods.
3 Multi-class classification is the problem of classifying instances into more than two classes. Multi-label
signifies that documents in this test set are associated with more than one class, and must be assigned a
set of labels during classification.

and the extent to which the words in the phrases overlap with the unigrams. We also
investigate which syntactic relations capture most information in the opinion of human
annotators. Finally, we perform experiments to investigate if our findings are language-
dependent. We will then draw some conclusions on what information is most valuable
for improving automatic patent classification.

Lewis (1992) was the first to investigate the use of phrases as index terms for text
classification. He found that phrases generally suffer from data sparseness and may
actually cause classification performance to deteriorate. These findings were confirmed
by Apt´e, Damerau, and Weiss (1994). With the advent of increasing computational
power and bigger data sets, however, the topic has been revisited in the last two decades
(Bekkerman and Allan 2003).
In this section we will give an overview of the major findings in previous re-
search on the use of statistical and syntactic phrases for text classification. Except when
mentioned explicitly, all the classification experiments reported here were conducted
using the Reuters-21578 data set, a well-known benchmark of 21,578 short newswire
texts for multi-class classification into 118 categories (a document has an average of
1.24 class labels).
2.1.1 Combining Unigrams with Statistical Phrases. For an excellent overview of the work
on using phrases done up to 2002, see Bekkerman and Allan (2003), and Tan, Wang, and
Lee (2002).
Because they contain more specific information, one might think that phrases are
more powerful features for text classification. There are two ways of using phrases as
index terms: either index terms only or in combination with unigrams. All experimental
results, however, show that using only phrases as index terms leads to a decrease
in classification accuracy compared with the BOW baseline (Bekkerman and Allan
2003). Both Mladenic and Grobelnik (1998) and F¨urnkranz (1998) showed that classifiers
trained on combinations of unigrams and n-grams composed of at most three words
performed better than classifiers that only use unigrams; no improvement was obtained
when using larger n-grams. Because trigrams are sparser than bigrams, most of the
subsequent research has focused on optimizing the combination of unigrams and
bigrams using different feature selection techniques.
2.1.2 Feature Selection. Obviously, unigrams and bigrams overlap: Bigrams are pairs of
unigrams. Caropreso, Matwin, and Sebastiani (2001) evaluated the relative importance
of unigrams and bigrams in a classifier-independent study: Instead of determining the
impact of features on the classification scores, they scored all unigrams and bigrams
using conventional feature evaluation functions to find the features that are most
representative for the document classes. For the Reuters-21578 data set, they found
that many bigram features scored higher than unigram features. These (theoretical)
findings were not confirmed in subsequent classification experiments, however. When
the bigram/unigram ratio for a fixed number of features is changed to favor bigrams,
classification performance tends to go down. It appears that the information in the
bigrams does not turn the unigrams redundant.

Braga, Monard, and Matsubara (2009) used a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
to investigate classification performance with unigrams and bigrams by comparing
multiview classification (the results of two independent classifiers trained with unigram
and bigram features are merged) with monoview classification (unigrams and bigrams
are combined in a single feature set).5 They found that there is little difference between
the output of the mono- and multiview classifiers. In the multiview classifiers, the
unigram and bigram classifiers make similar decisions in assigning labels, although
the latter generally yielded lower confidence values. Consequently, in the merge the
unigram and bigram classifiers affirm each other’s decisions, which does not result
in an overall improvement in classification accuracy. The authors suggest combining
unigrams only with those bigrams for which it holds that the whole provides more
information than the sum of the parts.
Tan, Wang, and Lee (2002) proposed selecting highly representative and meaningful
bigrams based on the Mutual Information scores of the words in a bigram compared
with the unigram class model. They selected only the top 2% of the bigrams as index
terms, and found a significant improvement over their unigram baseline, which was low
compared to state-of-the-art results. Bekkerman and Allan (2003) failed to improve over
their unigram baseline when using similar selection criteria based on the distributional
clustering of unigram models. Crawford, Koprinska, and Patrick (2004) were not able to
improve e-mail classification when using the selection criteria proposed by Tan, Wang,
and Lee.
2.1.3 Combining Unigrams with Syntactic Phrases. Lewis (1992) and Apt´e, Damerau, and
Weiss (1994) were the first to investigate the impact of syntactic phrases6 as features for
text classification. Dumais et al. (1998) and Scott and Matwin (1999) did not observe
a significant improvement in classification on the Reuters-21578 collection when noun
phrases obtained with a shallow parser were used instead of unigrams. Moschitti and
Basili (2004) found that neither words augmented with word sense information, nor
syntactic phrases (acquired through shallow parsing) in combination with unigrams
improved over the BOW baseline. Syntactic phrases appear to be even sparser than
bigrams. Therefore, it is not surprising that most papers concluded that classifiers using
only syntactic phrases perform worse than the baseline, except when the BOW baseline
is low for that particular classification task (Mitra et al. 1997; F¨urnkranz 1999).
Deep syntactic parsing is a computationally expensive process, but thanks to the
increase in computational power it is now possible to use phrases acquired through
deep syntactic parsing in classification tasks. Nastase, Sayyad, and Caropreso (2007)
used Minipar to generate dependency triples that are combined with lemmatized and
unlemmatized unigrams to classify the 10 most frequent classes in the Reuters-21578
data set. Their criterion for selecting triples as index terms is document frequency ≥ 2.
The small improvement over the lemmatized unigram baseline was not statistically
significant. ¨Ozg¨ur and G¨ung¨or (2010, 2012) achieve small but significant improvements
when combining unigrams with a subset of the dependency types from the Stanford
parser on three different data sets, including the Reuters-21578 set. They find that
separate pruning levels (based on the term frequency–inverse document frequency
[TF-IDF] score of the index units) for the unigrams and syntactic phrases influence

5 The difference between multiview and monoview classification corresponds to what is called late and
early fusion in the pattern recognition literature.
6 The concept “syntactic phrase” can be given several different interpretations, such as noun phrases,
verb phrases, predicate structures, dependency triples, and so forth.

classification accuracy. Which dependency relations prove most relevant for a classifi-
cation task depends greatly on the language use in the different data sets: The informal
MiniNG data set (usenet posts) benefits a little from “simple” dependencies such as part,
denoting a phrasal verb, for example write down, while classification in the more formal
Reuters-21578 (newswire) and NSF (scientific abstracts) data sets is more improved by
using dependencies on phrase and clause level (adjectival modifier, compound noun,
prepositional attachment; and subject and object, respectively). The highest-ranking
features for the NSF data set are compound noun (nn), adjectival modifier (amod),
subject (subj), and object (obj), respectively. Furthermore, they observe that splitting up
more generic relator types (such as prep) into different, more specific, subtypes increases
the classification accuracy.

<bodyText confidence="0.99978925">
It is not possible to draw far-reaching conclusions from previous research on patent
classification, because there is no tradition of using a “standard” data set, and a standard
split of patent corpora in a training and test set. Furthermore, there are differences
between the various experiments in task definitions (mono-label versus multi-label
classification); the granularity of the classification (depth in the IPC hierarchy); and the
choices of (sub)sets of data. Fall and Benzineb (2002) give an overview of the work done
in patent classification research up to 2002 and of the commercial patent classification
systems available; see Benzineb and Guyot (2011) for a general introduction to patent
classification.
Larkey (1999) was the first to present a fully automated patent classification system,
but she did not report her overall accuracy results. Larkey (1998) used a combination
of weighted words and noun phrases as index terms to classify a subset of the USPTO
database, but found no improvement over a BOW baseline. The weights were calculated
as follows: Frequency of a word or phrase in a particular section times the manually
assigned weight (importance) given to that section. The weights for each word or phrase
were then summed across sections. Term selection was based on a threshold for these
weights.
Krier and Zacc`a (2002) organized a comparative study of various academic and
commercial systems for patent classification for a common data set. In this informal
benchmark Koster, Seutter, and Beney (2001) achieved the best results, using the Bal-
anced Winnow algorithm with a word-only text representation. Classification is per-
formed for 44 or 549 categories (which correspond to different levels of depth in the
then used version of the IPC), with around 78% and 68% precision at 100% recall,
respectively.
Fall et al. (2003) introduced the EPO-alpha data set, attempting to create a common
benchmark for patent classification. Using only words as index terms, they tested
different classification algorithms and found that SVM outperform Naive Bayes, k-NN,
SNoW, and decision-based classifiers. They achieved P@3-scores7 of 73% and 59% on
114 classes and 451 subclasses, respectively. They also found that when using only
the first 300 words from the abstract, claims, and description sections, classification
accuracy is increased compared with using the complete sections. The same data set
was later used by Koster and Seutter (2003), who experimented with a combined

representation of words and phrases consisting of head-modifier pairs.8 They found
that head-modifier pairs could not improve on the BOW-baseline: The phrases were too
sparse to have much impact on the classification process.
Starting in 2009, the IRF9 has organized CLEF-IP patent classification tracks in an
attempt to bridge the gap between academic research and the patent industry. For this
purpose the IRF has put a lot of effort into providing very large patent data sets,10 which
have enabled academic researchers to train their algorithms on real-life data. In the
CLEF-IP 2010 classification track the best results were achieved by Guyot, Benzineb,
and Falquet (2010). Using the Balanced Winnow algorithm, they achieved a P@1-score
of 83%, while classifying on subclass level. They used a combination of words and
statistical phrases (collocations of variable length extracted from the corpus) as index
terms and used all available documents (in English, French, and German) in the corpus
as training data. In the same competition, Derieux et al. (2010) came second (in terms of
P@1). They also used a mixed document representation of both single words and longer
phrases, which had been extracted from the corpus by counting word co-occurrences.
Verberne, Vogel, and D’hondt (2010) and Beney (2010) experimented with a combined
representation of words and syntactic phrases derived from an English and French
syntactic parser, respectively. They both found that adding syntactic phrases to words
improves classification accuracy slightly. Beney (2010) remarks that this improvement
may be language-dependent. As a follow-up, Koster et al. (2011) investigated the added
value of syntactic phrases. They found that attributive phrases, that is, combinations
of adjective or nouns with nouns, were by far the most important syntactic phrases for
patent classification. On a subset of the CLEF-IP 2010 corpus11 they also found a small,
but significant, improvement when adding dependency triples to words.

In this article, we investigate the relative contributions of different types of terms to
the performance of patent classification. We use four different types of terms, namely,
lemmatized unigrams, lemmatized bigrams (see Section 3.2.1), lemmatized dependency
triples obtained with the Stanford parser (see Section 3.2.2), and lemmatized depen-
dency triples obtained with the AEGIR parser (see Section 3.2.3). We will leave term
(feature) selection to the preprocessing module of the Linguistic Classification System
(LCS) which we used for all experiments (see Section 3.3). We will analyze the rela-
tion between unigrams and phrases in the class profiles in some detail, however (see

to 1.3 million individual patents, published between 1985 and 2001.13 The documents
in the collection are encoded in a customized XML format and may include text in
English, French, and German. In addition to the standard sections of a patent document
(title, abstract, claims, and description section), the documents also include meta-
information on inventor, date of application, assignee, and so forth. Because our focus
lies on text representation, we did not include any of the meta-data in our document
representations.
The most informative sections of a patent document are generally considered to
be the title, the abstract, and the beginning of the description (Benzineb and Guyot
2011). Verberne and D’hondt (2011) showed that using both the description and the
abstract gives a small, but significant, improvement in classification results on the
CLEF-IP 2011 corpus, compared with classification on abstracts only. The effort in-
volved in parsing the descriptions is considerable, however: Because of the long
sentences and the dense word use, a parser will have much more difficulty in pro-
cessing text from the description section than from the abstracts. The titles of the
patent documents also pose a parsing problem: These are generally short noun phrases
that contain ambiguous PP-attachments that are impossible to disambiguate without
any domain knowledge. This leads to incorrect syntactic analyses and, consequently,
noisy dependency triple features. Because we are interested in comparing classification
results for different text representations, and not in comparing results for different
sections, we opted to use only the abstract sections of the patent document in the
current article.
From the corpus, we extracted all files that contain both an abstract in English and at
least one IPC class14 in the &lt;classification-ipcr&gt; field. We extracted the IPC classes on the
document level; this means that we did not include the documents where the IPC class
is in a separate file than the English abstract. In total, there were 121 different classes in
our data set. Most documents have been assigned one to three different IPC classes (on
class level). On average, a patent abstract in our data set has 2.12 class labels. Previous
cross-validation experiments on the same document set showed very little variation
(standard deviation &lt; 0.3%) between the classification accuracies in different training-
test splits (Verberne, Vogel, and D’hondt 2010). We therefore decided to use only one
training and test set split.15
The final data set contained 532,264 abstracts, divided into two sets: (1) a training
set (425,811 documents) and (2) a test set (106,453 documents). The distribution of the
data over the classes is in accordance with the Pareto Principle: 20% of the classes cover
80% of the data, and 80% of the classes comprise only 20% of the data.

14 For our classification experiments we use the codes on the class level in the IPC8 classification.
15 The data split was performed using a perl script that randomly shuffles the documents and puts them
into a train set and test set, while ensuring that the class distribution of the examples in the train set
approximates that of the whole corpus. It can be downloaded as part of the LCS distribution.

We then used a perl script to divide the running text into sentences, by splitting on
end-of-sentence punctuation such as question marks and full stops. In order to mini-
mize incorrect splitting, the perl script was supplied with a list of common English
abbreviations and a list containing abbreviations and acronyms that occur frequently in
technical texts, derived from the Specialist lexicon.16
3.2.1 Unigrams and Bigrams. The sentences in the abstract documents were converted
to single words by splitting on whitespaces and removing punctuation. The words
were then lemmatized using the AEGIR lexicon. Bigrams were created through a
similar procedure. We did not create bigrams that spanned sentence boundaries. This
resulted in approximately 60 million unigram and bigram tokens for the present
corpus.
3.2.2 Stanford. The Stanford parser is a broad-coverage natural language parser that is
trained on newswire text, for which it achieves state-of-the-art performance. The parser
has not been optimized/retrained for the patent domain.17 In spite of the technical
difficulties (Parapatics and Dittenbach 2009) and loss of linguistic accuracy for patent
texts reported in Mille and Wanner (2008), most patent processing systems that use
linguistic phrases use the Stanford parser because its dependency scheme has a number
of properties that are valuable for Text Mining purposes (de Marneffe and Manning
2008). The Stanford parser collapsed typed dependency model has a set of 55 differ-
ent syntactic relators to capture semantically contentful relations between words. For
example, the sentence The system will consist offour separate modules is analyzed into the
following set of dependency triples in the Stanford representation:

The Stanford parser was compiled with a maximum memory heap of 1.2 GB.

cores with 4 GB RAM per core. The resulting dependency triples were stripped of the
word indexes and then lemmatized using the AEGIR lexicon.
3.2.3 AEGIR. AEGIR18 is a dependency parser that was designed specifically for ro-
bust parsing of technical texts. It combines a hand-crafted grammar with an exten-
sive word-form lexicon. The parser lexicon was compiled from different technical
terminologies, such as the SPECIALIST lexicon and the UMLS.19 The AEGIR parser
aims to capture the aboutness of sentences. Rather than outputting extensive linguis-
tic detail on the syntactic structure of the input sentence as in the Stanford parser,
AEGIR returns only the bare syntactic–semantic structure of the sentence. During the
parsing process, it effectively performs normalization at various levels, such as ty-
pography (for example, upper and lower case, spacing), spelling (for example, British
and American English, hyphenation), morphology (lemmatization of word forms), and
syntax (standardization of the word order and transforming passive structures into
active ones).
The AEGIR parser uses only eight syntactic relators and returns fewer unique
triples than the Stanford parser. The parser is currently still under development; for this
article we used the version AEGIR v.1.7.5. The parser was constrained to a time limit of
maximum three seconds per sentence. This caused a loss of 0.7% of parser output on the
complete data set. Parsing the entire set of abstracts took slightly less than a week on
the computer cluster described above. The AEGIR parser has several output formats,
among which its own dependency format. The example sentence used to illustrate the
output of the Stanford parser is analyzed as follows:
[system,SUBJ,consist]
[consist,PREPof,module]
[module,ATTR,separate]
[module,QUANT,four]

and stemming are standard approaches to decreasing the sparsity of features; stemming
is more aggressive than lemmatization. Ozg¨ur and G¨ung¨or (2009) showed that—when
using only words as index terms—stemming (with the Porter Stemmer) appears to
improve performance; stemming dependency triples did not improve performance,
however.
We opted to use a less aggressive form of generalization: Lemmatizing the word
forms. We found that the bigrams gain20 most by lemmatizing the word forms, resulting
in a higher token/type ratio. From Table 1 it can be seen that there are fewer triple
tokens than bigram tokens: Whereas all the (high-frequency) function words are kept in
the bigram representations, both dependency formats discard some function words in
their parser output. For example, the AEGIR parser does not create triples for auxiliary
verbs, and in both dependency formats, the prepositions become part of the relator.
Consequently, the parsers will output fewer but more variable tokens, which results in
lower token/type ratios and a lower impact of lemmatization.

The classification experiments were carried out within the framework of the LCS
(Koster, Seutter, and Beney 2003). The LCS has been developed for the purpose of
comparing different text representations. Currently, three classifier algorithms are avail-
able: Naive Bayes, Balanced Winnow (Dagan, Karov, and Roth 1997), and SVM-light
(Joachims 1999). Verberne, Vogel, and D’hondt (2010) found that Balanced Winnow and
SVM-light yield comparable classification accuracy scores for patent texts on a similar
data set, but that Balanced Winnow is much faster than SVM-light for classification
problems with a large number of classes. The Naive Bayes classifier yielded a lower
accuracy. We therefore only used the Balanced Winnow algorithm for our classification
experiments, which were run with the following LCS configuration, based on tuning
experiments on the same data by Koster et al. (2011):

• Global term selection (GTS): Document frequency minimum is 2, term frequency
minimum is 3. Although initial term selection is necessary when dealing with such
a large corpus, we deliberately aimed at keeping as many of the sparse phrasal
terms as possible.
• Local term selection (LTS): Simple Chi Square (Galavotti, Sebastiani, and Simi
2000). We used the LCS option to automatically select the most representative
terms for every class, with a hard maximum of 10,000 terms per class.21
• After LTS the selected terms of all classes are aggregated into one combined term
vocabulary, which is used as the starting point for training the individual classes
(see Table 3).

20 By “gain” we mean the decrease in number of types for the lemmatized forms compared to the
non-lemmatized forms, which will result in higher corresponding token/type ratios.
21 Increasing the cut-off to 100,000 terms resulted in a small increase in accuracy (F1 values) for the
combined representations, mostly for the larger classes. Because the patent domain has a large lexical
variety, a large amount of low-frequency terms in the tail of the term distribution can have a large
impact on the accuracy scores. Because we are more interested in the relative gains between different
text representations and the corresponding top terms in the class profiles than in achieving maximum
classification scores, we opted to use only 10,000 terms for efficiency reasons.

• Winnow configuration: We performed tuning experiments for the Winnow param-
eters on a development set of around 100,000 documents. We arrived at using the
same setting as Koster et al. (2011), namely, α = 1.02, β = 0.98, 0+ = 2.0, 0− = 0.5,

• For each document the LCS returns a ranked list of all possible labels and the
attendant confidence scores. If the score assigned is higher than a predetermined

imum of one label (with the highest score, even if it is lower than the threshold)
and a maximum of four labels for each document.

Table 2 shows the impact of our global term selection criteria for the different text
representations. This first feature reduction step is category-independent: The features
are discarded on the basis of the term and document frequencies over the corpus, dis-
regarding their distributions for the specific categories. We can see that the token/type
ratio of Table 1 is mirrored in this table: The sparsest syntactic phrases lose most terms.
Although the Stanford parser output is the sparsest text representation, it has the largest
pool of terms to select from at the end of the GTS process.
The impact of the second feature reduction phase is shown in Table 3. During local
term selection, the LCS finds the most representative terms for each class by selecting
the terms whose distributions in the sets of positive and negative training examples
for that class are maximally different from the general term distribution. We can see
that in the combined runs only around 50% of the selectable unigrams (after GTS) are
22 For the BOW baseline, the GTS criteria resulted in a too small term set that could then be used as a
starting point for the local term selection process for the individual classes. In such cases, the LCS has
a back-off mechanism that automatically (re)selects terms that were initially discarded during GTS.
In other words, the baseline classifier used terms that do not comply with the criteria in the GTS as
described in the text. In the combination runs, enough terms remained after GTS and no unigrams or
phrases that did not match the GTS criteria were selected.

Table 4 shows the micro-averages of Precision, Recall, and F1 for five classification ex-
periments with different document representations. To give an idea of the complexity of
the task we have included a random guessing baseline in the first row.23 We found that
extending a unigram representation with statistical and/or linguistic phrases gives a
significant improvement in classification accuracy over the unigram baseline. The best-
performing classifier is the one that combines all four text representations. When adding
only type of phrase to unigrams, the unigrams + bigrams combination is significantly
better than the combinations with syntactic phrases. Combining all four representations
boosts recall, but has less impact on precision.

The results are similar to ¨Ozg¨ur and G¨ung¨or’s (2012) findings for scientific
abstracts: Adding phrases to unigrams can significantly improve classification. The text
in the patent corpus is vastly different from the newswire text in the Reuters corpus.
Like scientific abstracts, patents are full of jargon and terminology, often expressed in
multi-word units, which might favor phrasal representations. Moreover, the innovative
concepts in a patent are sometimes described in generalized terms combined with some
specifier (to ensure larger legal scope). For example, a hose might be referred to as a
watering device. The term hose can be captured with a unigram representation, but the
multi-word expression cannot. The difference with the results on the Reuters-21578
data set (discussed in Section 2.1.1), however, may not completely be due to genre
differences: Bekkerman and Allan (2003) remark that the unigram baseline for the
Reuters-21578 task is difficult to improve upon, because in that data set a few keywords
are enough to distinguish between the categories.

4.2 Unigram versus Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9966504">
In this section we investigate whether adding phrases suppresses, complements, or
changes unigram selection. To examine the impact of phrases in the classification
process, we analyzed the class profiles24 of two large classes (H04 – Electric Communica-
tion Technique; and H01 – Basic electric elements) that show significant improvements
in both Precision and Recall25 for the bigram classifier compared with the unigram
baseline. We look at (1) the overlap of the single words in the class profiles of the
unigram and combined representations; and (2) the overlap of the single words and the
words that make up the phrases (hereafter referred to as parts) within the class profile
of one text representation.
4.2.1 Overlap of Unigrams. The class profiles in the baseline unigram classifier contained
far fewer terms ( &lt; 20%) than the profiles in the classifiers that combine unigrams and
phrases. This could be expected from the data in tables 2 and 3.
Unigrams are the highest ranked26 features in the combined representation class
profiles (see Table 5). Furthermore, words that are important terms for unigram clas-
sification also rank high in the combined class profiles: On average, there is an 80%

class profiles. This decreases to 75% when looking at the 5,000 most important words.
This shows that the classifier tends to select mostly the same words as important terms
for the different text representation combinations. The relative ranking of the words is
very similar in the class profiles of all the text representations. Thus, adding phrases
to unigrams does not result in replacing the most important unigrams for a particular
class and the improvements in classification accuracy must derive from the additional
information in the selected phrases.

(2001), we investigated to what extent the parts of the high-ranked phrases overlap with
words in the unigrams + bigrams class profile. We first looked at the lexical overlap of
the words and the parts of the bigrams in the H01 unigrams + bigrams class profile.
Interestingly, we found a relatively low overlap between the words and the parts of
the phrases: For the 20 most important bigrams, only 11 of the 32 unique parts of the
bigrams overlap with the 100 most important single word terms; in the complete class
profile only 56% of the 10,387 parts of the bigrams overlap with the 9,064 words in
the class profile. This means that a large part of the bigrams contains complementary
information not present in the unigrams in the class profile.
To gain a deeper insight into the relationship between the bigrams and their parts,
we also looked at the mass of the different terms in the class profiles. The mass of a
term for a certain class is the product of its TF–IDF score and its Winnow weight for
that class; ”mass” provides an estimate of how much a term contributes to the score of
documents for a particular class. We can divide the terms into three main categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997698">
(a) mass(partA) &gt; mass(partB) &gt; mass(bigram);
(b) mass(partA) &gt; mass(bigram) &gt; mass(partB);
(c) mass(bigram) &gt; mass(partA) &gt; mass(partB).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980933333333">
We note that 50% of the top 1,000 highest ranked bigrams fall within category (b) and
typically consist of one part with high mass accompanied by a part with a low mass,
which can be a function word (for example a transmitter), or a general term (for example,
device in optical device). The highest ranked bigrams can be found in category (a) where
two highly informative words are combined to form very specific concepts, for example,
fuel cell. These are specifications of a more general concept that is typical for that class in
the corpus. The bigrams in this category are similar to those investigated by Caropreso,
Matwin, and Sebastiani (2001) and Tan, Wang, and Lee (2002). Though highly ranked,
they only make up a small subset (22%) of the important bigram features.
The bigrams in category (c) (27%) are typically made up from low-ranked single
words, such as mobile station. Interestingly, most bigram parts in this subset do not occur
as word terms in the unigram and bigram class profiles, but occur in the negative class
profiles (a selection of terms that are considered to describe anything but that particular
class). The complementary information of bigram phrases (compared to unigrams) is
contained in this set of bigrams.

complement bigrams. In this section we examine what information is captured by the
different phrases and how this accounts for the differences in classification accuracy.
4.3.1 Class Profile Analysis. We first examined the differences between the statistical
phrases and the two types of linguistic phrases to discover what information contained
in the bigrams leads to better classification results. We performed our analysis on the
different class profiles of B60 (“Vehicles in general”), a medium-sized class, which most
clearly shows the advantage of the bigram classifier compared to the classifiers with
linguistic phrases.27
All four class profiles with phrases contain roughly the same set of unigrams
(between 78% to 91% overlap) that occur quite high in the corresponding unigram class
profile. The AEGIR class profile contains 10% more unigrams than the other combined
representation class profiles; these are mainly words that appear in the negative class
profile of the corresponding unigram classifier. As in class H01, the relative position of
the words remains the same. The absolute position of the words in the list, however,
does change: Caropreso, Matwin, and Sebastiani (2001) introduced a measure for the
effectiveness of phrases as terms, called the penetration, that is, the percentage of
phrases in the top k terms when classifying with both words and phrases.
Comparing the penetration levels at the various ranks for the different classifiers,
we can see that the classification results correspond with the tendency of a classifier to
select phrases in the top k terms. Interestingly, we see a large disparity in the phrasal
features that are selected by the combination classifier. The preference for bigrams
is mirrored by the penetration levels of the unigrams + bigrams classifier which has
selected more bigrams at higher ranks in the class profile than the classifiers with the
linguistic phrases. This is in line with the findings of Caropreso, Matwin, and Sebastiani
(2001) that penetration levels are a reasonable way to compute the contribution of
n-grams to the quality of a feature set. On average, the linguistic phrases have much
smaller weight in the class profiles than the bigrams and, consequently, are likely
to have a smaller impact during the classification process. For the combination run,
however, it seems that a long tail of small-impact features does improve classification
accuracy.
Linguistic analysis of the top 100 phrases in the profiles of class B60 shows that
all classifiers select similar types of phrases. We manually annotated the bigrams with
the correct syntactic dependencies (in the Stanford collapsed typed dependency format)
and compared these with the syntactic relations expressed in the linguistic phrases. The
results are summarized in Table 6.
It appears that noun phrases and compounds such as circuit board and electric
device are by far the most important terms in the class profiles. Interestingly, phrases
that contain a determiner relation (e.g., the device) are deemed equally important in
all four different class profiles. It is unlikely that this is a semantic effect, that is, that
the determiner relation provides additional semantic information to the nouns in the
phrases, but rather it seems an artefact of the abundance of noun phrases which occur
in patent texts. We also looked into the lexical overlap between the parts of the different
types of phrases. We found that the selected phrases encode almost exactly the same
information in all three representations: There is an 80% overlap between the parts of

Given that the class profiles select the same set of words and contain phrases with
a high lexical overlap, therefore, how do we explain the marked differences in classifi-
cation accuracy between the three different representations? These must stem from the
different combinations of the words in the phrasal features. To examine in detail how the
features created through the different text represenations differ, we conducted a feature
quality assessment experiment against a manually created reference set.
4.3.2 Human Quality Assessment Experiment. To gain more insight in the syntactic and
semantic relations that are considered most informative by humans, we conducted
an experiment in which we asked human annotators to select the five to ten most
informative phrases29 for 15 sentences taken at random from documents in the three
largest classes in the corpus. We then compiled a reference set consisting of 70 phrases
(4.6 phrases per sentence) which were considered as “informative” by at least three
out of four annotators. Of these, 57 phrases were noun–noun compounds and 11 were
combinations of an adjectival modifier with a noun. None of the annotators selected
phrases containing determiners.
We created bigrams from the input and extracted head–modifier pairs30 from the
parser output for the sentences in the test set. We then compared the overlap of the
generated phrases with the reference phrases. We found that bigrams overlap with

triples overlap with 57 phrases. Although three data points are not enough to compute
a formal measure, it is interesting to note the correspondence with the number of terms
kept for the three text representations after Local Term Selection (see Table 3). The fact
that the text representation with the smallest number of terms after LTC and with the
smallest overlap with “contentful” phrases in a text as indicated by human annotators
still yields the best classification performance suggests that not all “contentful” phrases
are important or useful for the task of classifying that text. This finding is reminiscent of
the fact that the “optimal” summary of a text is dependent on the goal with which the
summary was produced (Nenkova and McKeown 2011).
Only 15% of the phrases extracted by the human annotators contain word combi-
nations that have long-distance dependencies in the original sentences. This suggests

28 As mentioned in Section 3.2.3 the AEGIR parser uses a more condensed dependency output format.
The Stanford’s nn and amod are collapsed into the attributive (ATTR) relation.

the order in which they occur in the sentence.

that the most meaningful phrases are expressed in local dependencies, that is, adjacent
words. Consequently, syntactic analysis aimed at discovering meaning expressed by
long-distance dependencies can only make a small contribution. A further analysis of
the phrases showed that the smaller coverage of the bigrams is due to the fact that some
of the relevant noun–noun combinations are missed because function words, typically
determiners or prepositions, occur between the nouns. For example, the annotators
constructed the reference phrase rotation axis for the noun phrase the rotation of the
second axis. This reference phrase cannot be captured by the bigram representation.
When intervening function words are removed from the sentences, the coverage of
the resulting bigrams on the reference set rises31 to 59 phrases (more than AEGIR, and
almost as many as Stanford). Despite the fact that generating more phrases does not
necessarily lead to better classification performance, we intend to use bigrams stripped
of function words as additional terms for patent classification in future experiments.
The analysis also revealed an indication why syntactic phrases may lead to inferior
classification results: Both syntactic parsers consistently fail to find the correct structural
analysis of the long and complex noun phrases such as an implantable, inflatable dual
chamber shape retention tissue expander, which are frequent in patent texts. Phrases like
this contain many compounds in an otherwise complex syntactic structure, namely
[an [implantable, inflatable [[dual chamber] [shape retention] [tissue expander]]]].
For a parser it is impossible to parse this correctly without knowing which word se-
quences are actually compounds. That knowledge might be gleaned from the frequency
with which sequences of nouns and adjectives occur in a given domain. For the time
being, the Stanford parser (and the AEGIR parser, to a lesser extent) will parse any
noun phrase by attaching the individual words to the right-most head noun, resulting
in the following analysis:
[an [implantable, [inflatable [dual [chamber [shape [retention [tissue expander]]]]]]]].
This effectively destroys many of the noun–noun compounds, which are the most
important features for patent classification (see Table 6). Bigrams are less prone to this
type of “error.”
These findings are confirmed when looking at the overlap of the word combi-
nations: Although there is high lexical overlap between the phrases of the different
representations (80% overlap of the parts of phrases in Section 4.3.1), the overlap of
the word combinations that make up the phrases is much lower: Only 33% of the top
1,000 phrases are common between all three representations.

4.4 Stanford versus AEGIR Triples

The performance with the unigrams + Stanford triples is not significantly different from
the combination with AEGIR triples. Because the AEGIR triples are slightly less sparse
(see Table 1), we expected that these would have an advantage over Stanford triples.
Most of the normalization processes that make the AEGIR triples less sparse concern
syntactic variation on the clause level, however. But as was shown in Section 4.3,
31 This result is language-dependent: English has a fairly rigid phrase-internal word order but for a more
synthetic language with a more variable word order, like Russian, bigram coverage might suffer from
the variation in the surface form.

the most important terms for classification in the patent domain are found in the
noun phrase, where Stanford and AEGIR perform similar syntactic analyses. Although
Stanford’s dependency scheme is more detailed (see Table 6), the noun-phrase internal
dependencies in the Stanford parser map practically one-to-one onto AEGIR’s set of
relators, resulting in very similar dependency triple features for classification. Con-
sequently, there is no normalization gain in using the AEGIR dependency format to
describe the internal structure of the noun phrases.

4.5 Comparison with French and German Patent Classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979545454545">
We found that phrases contribute to improving classification on English patent ab-
stracts. The improvement might be language-dependent, however, because compounds
are treated differently in different languages. A compounding language like German
might benefit less from using phrases than English. To estimate the generalizability of
our findings, we conducted additional experiments in which we compared the impact
of adding bigrams to unigrams for both French and German.
Using the same methods described in sections 3.1 and 3.2, we extracted and pro-
cessed all French and German abstracts from the CLEF-IP 2010 corpus, resulting in two
new data sets that contained 86,464 and 294,482 documents, respectively (Table 7). Both
data sets contained the same set of 121 labels and had label distributions similar to the
English data set. The sentencing script was updated with the most common French and
German abbreviations to minimize incorrect sentence splitting. The resulting sentences
were then tagged using the French and German versions of the TreeTagger.32 From the
tagged output, we extracted the lemmas and used these to construct unigrams and
bigrams for both languages. We ran the experiments with the LCS using the settings
reported in Section 3.3.
The results show a much smaller but still significant improvement for using bigrams
when classifying French patent abstracts and even a deterioration for German. Due to
the difference in size between the English and French data set it is difficult to draw hard
conclusions on which language benefits most from adding bigrams. It is clear, however,
that our findings are not generalizable to German (and probably other compounding
languages).

abstracts, we found that adding phrases to unigrams significantly improves classifi-
cation results for English. Of the three types of phrases examined in this article, bigrams
have the most impact, both in the experiment that combined all four text representa-
tions, and in combination with unigrams only.
The abundance of compounds in the terminology-rich language of the patent do-
main results in a relatively high importance for the phrases. The top phrases across
the different representations were mostly noun–noun compounds (for example watering
device), followed by phrases containing a determiner relation (for example the module)
and adjective modifier phrases (for example separate module).
The information in the phrases and unigrams overlaps to a large extent: Most of the
phrases consist of words that are important unigram features in the combined profile
and that also appear in the corresponding unigram class profile. When examining the
H01 class profiles, however, we found that 27% of the selected phrases contain words
that were not selected in the unigram profile (see Section 4.2.2).
When comparing the impact of features created from the output of the aboutness-
based AEGIR parser with those from the Stanford parser, we found the latter resulted in
slightly (but not significantly) better classification results. AEGIR’s normalization fea-
tures are not advantageous (compared with Stanford) in creating noun-phrase internal
triples, which are the most informative features for patent classification.
The parsers were not specifically trained for the patent domain and both experi-
enced problems with long, complex noun phrases consisting of sequences of words
that can function as adjective/adverb or noun and that are not interrupted by function
words that clarify the syntactic structure. The right-headed bias of both syntactic parsers
caused problems in analyzing those constructions, yielding erroneous and variable
data. As a consequence, parsers may miss potentially relevant noun–noun compounds
and noun phrases with adjectival modifiers. Because of the highly idiosyncratic nature
of the terminology used in the patent domain, it is not evident whether this prob-
lem can be solved by giving a parser access to information about the frequency with
which specific noun–noun, adjective–noun, and adjective/adverb–adjective pairs occur
in technical texts. Bigrams, on the other hand, are less variable (as seen in Table 1) and
therefore yield better classification results. This is the more important point because the
dependency relations marked as important for understanding a sentence by the human
annotators consist mainly of pairs of adjacent words.
We also performed additional experiments to examine the generalizability of our
findings for French and German: As could be expected, compounding languages like
German which express complex concepts in “one word” do not gain from using
bigrams.
In line with Bekkerman and Allan (2003) we can conclude that with the large quan-
tities of text available today, the role of phrases as features in text classification must
be reconsidered. For the automated classification of English patents at least, adding
phrases and more specifically bigrams significantly improves classification accuracy.

This article investigates how patent classification can be improved by using different representations of the patent documents. Using the Linguistic Classification System (LCS), we compare the impact of adding statistical phrases (in the form of bigrams) and linguistic phrases (in two different dependency formats) to the standard bag-of-words text representation on a subset of 532,264 English abstracts from the CLEF-IP 2010 corpus. In contrast to previous findings on classification with phrases in the Reuters-21578 data set, for patent classification the addition of phrases results in significant improvements over the unigram baseline. The best results were achieved by combining all four representations, and the second best by combining unigrams and lemmatized bigrams. This article includes extensive analyses of the class models (a.k.a. class profiles) created by the classifiers in the LCS framework, to examine which types of phrases are most informative for patent classification. It appears that bigrams contribute most to improvements in classification accuracy. Similar experiments were performed on subsets of French and German abstracts to investigate the generalizability of these findings.</abstract>

Therefore, it is not surprising that the best scoring multi-class, multi-label3 classification results for the well-known Reuters-21578 data set have been obtained using a BOW representation (Bekkerman and Allan 2003). But the limited contribution of phrases in addition to the BOW-representation does not seem to hold for all classification tasks: ¨Ozg¨ur and G¨ung¨or (2010) found significant differences in the impact of linguistic phrases between short newswire texts (Reuters-21578), scientific abstracts (NSF), and informal posts in usenet groups (MiniNg): Especially the classification of scientific abstracts could be improved by using phrases as index terms. In a follow-up study, ¨Ozg¨ur and G¨ung¨or (2012) found that for the three different data sets, different types of linguistic phrases have most impact.

The small improvement over the lemmatized unigram baseline was not statistically significant. ¨Ozg¨ur and G¨ung¨or (2010, 2012) achieve small but significant improvements when combining unigrams with a subset of the dependency types from the Stanford parser on three different data sets, including the Reuters-21578 set.

Starting in 2009, the IRF9 has organized CLEF-IP patent classification tracks in an attempt to bridge the gap between academic research and the patent industry. For this purpose the IRF has put a lot of effort into providing very large patent data sets,10 which have enabled academic researchers to train their algorithms on real-life data. In the CLEF-IP 2010 classification track the best results were achieved by Guyot, Benzineb, and Falquet (2010). Using the Balanced Winnow algorithm, they achieved a P@1-score of 83%, while classifying on subclass level. They used a combination of words and statistical phrases (collocations of variable length extracted from the corpus) as index terms and used all available documents (in English, French, and German) in the corpus as training data. In the same competition, Derieux et al. (2010) came second (in terms of P@1). They also used a mixed document representation of both single words and longer phrases, which had been extracted from the corpus by counting word co-occurrences. Verberne, Vogel, and</context>

Consequently, the parsers will output fewer but more variable tokens, which results in lower token/type ratios and a lower impact of lemmatization. 3.3 Classification Experiments The classification experiments were carried out within the framework of the LCS (Koster, Seutter, and Beney 2003). The LCS has been developed for the purpose of comparing different text representations. Currently, three classifier algorithms are available: Naive Bayes, Balanced Winnow (Dagan, Karov, and Roth 1997), and SVM-light (Joachims 1999). Verberne, Vogel, and D’hondt (2010) found that Balanced Winnow and SVM-light yield comparable classification accuracy scores for patent texts on a similar data set, but that Balanced Winnow is much faster than SVM-light for classification problems with a large number of classes. The Naive Bayes classifier yielded a lower accuracy. We therefore only used the Balanced Winnow algorithm for our classification experiments, which were run with the following LCS configuration, based on tuning experiments on the same data by Koster et al.

It is clear, however, that our findings are not generalizable to German (and probably other compounding languages). 5. Conclusion In this article we have examined the usefulness of statistical and linguistic phrases for patent classification. Similar to ¨Ozg¨ur and G¨ung¨or’s (2010) results for scientific 32 http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/. 772 D’hondt et al. Text Representations for Patent Classification abstracts, we found that adding phrases to unigrams significantly improves classification results for English. Of the three types of phrases examined in this article, bigrams have the most impact, both in the experiment that combined all four text representations, and in combination with unigrams only. The abundance of compounds in the terminology-rich language of the patent domain results in a relatively high importance for the phrases. The</context>
