<bodyText confidence="0.999931641975309">
Computational linguistics in Malaysia began
in early 1977 with the implementation of a
morphological analyser for Malay for a
Masters thesis at Universiti Sains Malaysia
(USM) in Penang. The external examiner was
Professor Bernard Vauquois from Groupe
d&apos;Etudes pour la Traduction Autonatique
(GETA) in Grenoble, France. What started as
an academic event led to a very long term
collaboration between GETA and USM
starting with the development of a prototype
English-Malay machine translation (MT)
system using GETA&apos;s ARIANE-78 system that
further led to the development of various
linguistic tools and language databanks as well
as basic research on grammar formalisms. The
collaboration continues to this day with the
support of USM and the French government.
The Computer Aided Translation Unit (known
as UTMK) was set up in USM in 1984 and
spearheads the collaboration from the
Malaysian end. UTMK has slowed down
considerably on MT but continues work on
various other aspects of computational
linguistics, their latest effort being on a search
engine based on natural language processing
techniques.
Another group began in Universiti
Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) in 1988 with the
arrival of the Japanese CICC project
spearheaded by Fujitsu from the Japanese end
bringing with them the Atlas-II system. A
multi-lingual translation system project was set
up involving several east Asian countries, with
the Malaysian members being UTM and
Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), the Malay
Language Academy. The Malaysian
component of the project was called Kanta,
which lasted for about six years culminating in
the establishment of the National Institute of
Translation Malaysia (known as ITNM). ITNM
has since stopped work on MT and so has
UTM. UTM operated from Kuala Lumpur
during the Kanta project but the main campus
has moved to Johor Bahru.
A small but stable group exists in Universiti
Kebangsaan Malaysia in Bangi within the
Faculty of Information Technology. Their
work centres on the development of language
tools for Malay, such as natural language
query, morphological analysers, etc. Work in
other universities and research institutions is
very limited and sporadic. There was an
attempt at MT at Universiti Malaya in Kuala
Lumpur back in the mid-eighties and some
work on computer-aided language learning was
carried out for a while at Universiti Institute
Technologi MARA in Shah Alam.
To date, except for a handful (&lt;_ five) which
toyed with the idea of commercialising small
language tools (e.g. Malay spell-checker), no
private company has put in any serious effort
or investment into computational linguistics.
Government support other than for the Kanta
project is indeed very low, and researchers
have to compete with all other domains and
disciplines for the limited R&amp;D grants made
available by the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Environment (c.f. US$250
million for the entire period of the 7th Malaysia
plan (1996-2000). The level of appreciation for
the field has remained very low throughout its
23 year history in the country, especially given
the rush for quick results and profitability by
both the public and private sectors.
With the above, capacity within the country
in terms of numbers and level of expertise in
computational linguistics has never reached
the required critical mass. If anything, interest
in the field has been on a decline after its small
peak in the late eighties and early nineties.

2. Computer-Aided Translation Unit
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996077833333334">
The Computer-Aided Translation Unit or
Unit Terjemahan Melalui Komputer (UTMK)
is the longest running research unit working in
computational linguistics in the country.
Maintaining a core team of 6-10 researchers
and about the same number as contract
personnel, it has also always been the largest.
Apart from GETA (now GETA-CLIPS), which
is UTMK&apos;s closest and longest running foreign
collaborator, it has also worked with other
computational linguistic research units/teams
in UMIST, Bangkok, Prague, Sofia, Nijmegen,
Kyoto, etc. UTMK&apos;s closest local collaborator
is DBP, a partnership that dates back to 1982.
As mentioned earlier, UTMK began with
the development of a prototype English-Malay
MT system (for chemistry text) using GETA&apos;s
ARIANE-78 system. The work was completed
in 1985, but efforts to expand the prototype to
an industrial system was not successful due to
lack of financial support and too high
expectations (translation of text books in very
quick time). In parallel, a MT system shell
called JEMAH was developed in LISP on the
Macintosh (ARIANE-78 ran on the mainframe)
and the English-Malay prototype application
was completed in 1987.
As an immediate product for translation, a
machine-aided human translation (MAHT)
system called SISKEP was developed on the
IBM PC in 1986 and a Macintosh version in
1987, the design being inspired by Melby&apos;s
Mercury system. The system gained some
measure of popularity and was in fact put on
the market for almost a decade. Apart from the
screen design and other language specific
utilities, the basic components of SISKEP
included a bilingual dictionary look-up with
root-word extraction, Malay spell-checker (the
first in the country) and thesaurus look-up
(which led to the publication of the first ever
edition of a Malay thesaurus), and these basic
components were bundled in a desktop
accessory called RakanBM that could work
with any word processsor on the Macintosh or
on Windows. The considerable success of the
project led to the conception of a user-driven
MT system in 1989 (together with UMIST),
which is essentially SISKEP with JEMAH
running in the background, where users may
choose to toggle between MAHT facilities and
full MT depending on their translation needs.
Realising the need to collect linguistic tools
and in particular data for Malay in order to get
any further with MT or any computational
linguistic application for that matter, UTMK
embarked on building linguistic tools and
language databanks. A Malay text analysis
system called MATA (including concordance,
frequency counts, statistical analyses, etc.) was
developed in 1983 on the mainframe and was
later ported to the PC and then UNIX in 1990
to be included in a Corpus System for DBP.
The system now holds Malay texts with a total
of more than 12 million words. A Dictionary
System was also developed for DBP in 1992.
The system is a generic system that can
generate dictionary systems as applications,
and 5 DBP dictionaries have been
implemented using the said system, including a
first ever French-Malay dictionary (a
collaborative work involving the French
Embassy, DBP, GETA and UTMK). There
was an attempt to build a general Lexical
Database for Malay (Treasure Box: anything
one wants to know about Malay) but the
project never really got off the ground due to
lack of funds. These projects occupied the
period up to the end of 1995.
At the level of grammar, UTMK has always
worked on grammar formalisms, namely the
String-Tree Correspondence Grammar (STCG)
based on the concept of Structured String-Tree
Correspondence (SSTC). This also entailed
work on graphic grammar editors, parsers and
in particular a bilingual SSTC corpus bank to
fuel various experiments in example-based MT
as well as automatic generators of analysis and
synthesis programs. One major setback to such
efforts is the lack of formal linguistic studies
for Malay, a situation that has also forced
UTMK to work directly on Malay linguistics.
As of 1996, circumstances forced UTMK to
venture into more commercial undertakings.
One such project is the development of an EDI
engine (parsing/generation of message types
are needed). Others include a search engine (a
commercial product) based on word ontology
and distance, a multilingual chat system (real-
time MT for a very restricted language), and a
generic internet portal (...the relation to
computational linguistics is still unknown...).
