We present a detailed investigation of the
challenges posed when applying parsing mod-
els developed against English corpora to Chi-
nese. We develop a factored-model statis-
tical parser for the Penn Chinese Treebank,
showing the implications of gross statistical
differences between WSJ and Chinese Tree-
banks for the most general methods of parser
adaptation. We then provide a detailed anal-
ysis of the major sources of statistical parse
errors for this corpus, showing their causes
and relative frequencies, and show that while
some types of errors are due to difficult am-
biguities inherent in Chinese grammar, oth-
ers arise due to treebank annotation practices.
We show how each type of error can be ad-
dressed with simple, targeted changes to the
independence assumptions of the maximum
likelihood-estimated PCFG factor of the pars-
ing model, which raises our Fl from 80.7% to
82.6% on our development set, and achieves
parse accuracy close to the best published fig-
ures for Chinese parsing.

Even narrow-coverage context-free natural lan-

more, some of it genuine linguistic ambiguity

sus flat NP coordinations but are hardly an-
alyzed at all for any other language. More re-
cently, however, a wider variety of parsed cor-
pora has become available in other languages.
We take advantage of the recently released Penn
Chinese Treebank (version 2.0, abbreviated here
as CTB; (Xue et al., 2002)) to address these
questions for Chinese, a language with less mor-
phology and more mixed headedness than En-
glish. Chinese, as we will show, has a rather
different set of salient ambiguities from the per-
spective of statistical parsing. This section pro-
vides background on relevant linguistic differ-
ences between Chinese and English, and on rel-
evant tree-structural differences between the two
treebanks.
1.1 Linguistic differences between
English and Chinese
Chinese and English are both isolating lan-
guages: they rely primarily on relatively rigid
phrase structure rather than rich morphologi-
cal information to encode functional relations
between elements. For purposes of statistical
parsing, three salient differences distinguish the
two languages. First, Chinese makes less use of
function words and morphology than English:
determinerless nouns are more widespread, plu-
ral marking is restricted and rare, and verbs
appear in a unique form with few supporting
function words. Second, whereas English is
largely left-headed and right-branching, Chinese
is more mixed: most categories are right-headed,
but verbal and prepositional complements follow
their heads (Figure 2). Significantly, this means
that attachment ambiguity among a verb&apos;s com-
plements, a major source of parsing ambiguity in
English, is rare in Chinese. The third major dif-
ference is subject pro-drop the null realization
of uncontrolled pronominal subjects which is
widespread in Chinese, but rare in English. This
creates ambiguities between parses of subject-
less structures as IP (equivalent to ETB&apos;s S) or
as VP, and between interpretations of preverbal
NPs as NP adjuncts or as subjects.

1.2 Tree-Structural Differences between
English and Chinese Treebanks

The CTB consists of 325 newswire articles; 291
are on economic topics, 34 on politics and cul-
ture. Past work on CTB parsing (Bikel and
Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel, 2002) has used
articles 1-270 for training, 301-325 for develop-
ment, and 271-300 for testing. We found, how-
ever, that this development set was uncharacter-
istic of the corpus as a whole and not ideal for
development. As an extreme example, the word
*`- appears in it 28 times as a measure word,
meaning &apos;point&apos;, twice as an adverb, and once as
a verb; in the rest of the corpus it appears eight
times as a verb, once as an adverb, and never as
a measure word. There turns out to be a high
concentration of articles on non-economic topics
in 301-325 (the problem with *`- arising from
sports articles). Therefore, for this paper we
set aside articles 1-25 for development and used
26-270 as training during development. During
development, we found the difference in parse
accuracy for 1-25 and 301-325 to range around
a remarkable 10%.
Whereas ETB annotation strongly reflects
late 1970s mainstream transformational gram-
mar, CTB annotation draws primarily on
Government-Binding (GB) theory from the
1980s. GB differs from the former in two ma-
jor respects: first, it rigidly requires phrasal
projection of all lexical categories; second, it
sharply distinguishes between levels of adjunc-
tion and complementation. Both these differ-
ences are noticeable when comparing treebanks.
The first difference, projection of phrasal cat-
egories, is particularly prominent within NPs:
CTB adjective-noun modification, for example,
is always at the level of ADJP and NP, whereas
in English it can be a direct rewrite of NP to JJ
and NN tags (Figure 1). The second difference,
distinction of adjunction and complementation
levels, has been made only for VP (Figure 2),

consistent with the headedness issues described
in Section 1.1.
The rigid requirement of phrasal category pro-
jection is also manifest elsewhere: all Chinese
prenominal relative-clause equivalents have a
level of CP annotation, equivalent to ETB&apos;s
SBAR, containing a null WH-NP, even though
Chinese has no relative pronouns (the overt
prenominal modification marker, Aiv , introduces
another level of CP annotation when present, as
seen in Figure 3, but in this case the unary CP
is compressed under standard pre-parsing tree
transformations) .1 In the corresponding case for
the ETB, reduced relative clauses are annotated
as VPs.
These annotation practices have a strong ef-
fect on the gross statistics of the CTB after stan-
dard tree normalizations for parsing. The CTB
has far fewer rule types than an ETB of equiva-
lent size, and has a considerably lower branching
factor. In particular a far higher proportion of
&apos;Standard tree normalizations are: the removal of
empty nodes and nodes dominating no non-empty ter-
minals, and the subsequent removal of A over A unaries.

CTB rewrite rules are unary (Table 1).2 This is
consonant with the behavior of simple PCFGs

has a much stronger effect on training-data pars-

greater precision/recall split seen here for CTB
is also due to its lower branching factor.

2 Parsing model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974703964285714">
We use the factored parsing model of (Klein
and Manning, 2002). Parsing in this model
involves combining two independent parses:
one of a non-lexicalized, maximum likelihood-
estimated (MLE) PCFG model and another of
a constituent-free dependency parse. In addi-
tion to simplifying the parameterization of the
parsing model and maintaining exactness, this

model offers the prospect of increased flexibility
in tuning the individual parse models. In partic-
ular, linguistic generalizations corresponding to
category refinements are easily implemented via
category-splitting in the PCFG model, without
concern for affecting the dependency model.
In adapting this parsing model to Chinese, we
have retained unchanged the dependency model
developed for English; the model backs off to
tags, and backoff parameters remain the same.3
In all cases, test input to the parser was seg-
mented but untagged.4 Our focus in parser de-
velopment has been to refine the PCFG model
via stepwise refinements informed by major ob-
served ambiguity classes. We illustrate that each
of these refinements can effectively be viewed as
an amendment to the independence assumptions
made by a simple PCFG.

The simplest systematic augmentations to ba-
sic PCFG models are the inclusion of various
types of contextual information in the struc-
ture of individual node labels. In principle,
any contextual information could be used, but
in practice two types are most heavily relied
on: (i) information highly local to the enhanced
node; and (ii) a unique preterminal/terminal
pair identified as the head of the node. These
practices have correlates in contemporary lin-
guistic theory as principles of locality and lex-

icalism (Sag and Wasow, 1999). For head-
ship, the choices of node enhancement strat-
egy are fairly limited; for enrichment by local
context, there are far more choices. Of the
simplest local-context enrichment strategies, the
one that has proven effective on a systematic ba-
sis involves parent annotation; (Johnson, 1998)
showed that when uniformly applied, it consid-
erably improved WSJ Treebank parsing. Uni-
form enhancement by other local context, such
as sisters, daughters, or cousins, quickly leads to
unacceptable sparseness under MLE.
To begin development, we tested the inter-
action of complete parent and/or grandpar-
ent annotation with PCFG markovization (see
(Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) for discussion).
The indications for the utility of parent anno-
tation in CTB parsing are mixed. The CTB
is smaller and thus more susceptible to gram-
mar fragmentation, but it is also less flat (see
Table 1). We found that first-order markoviza-
tion was superior to zero-order, second-order,
and unmarkovized PCFGs for all levels of an-
cestor annotation, and that within first-order
markovization parent annotation was slightly
superior to no annotation, with grandparent an-
notation decidedly worse.

finement of punctuation tags along ETB lines,
which achieved an Fl of 80.7%. To assess the
major sources of parsing difficulty for Chinese,

4.1 Analysis by error type and
PCFG-enrichment fixes
Multilevel VP adjunction errors (Figure 5) are
common in models without parent annotation,
although even with parent annotation the pres-
ence of VP coordination would give multilevel
VP adjunction nonzero probability. We address
this error by taking advantage of the CTB&apos;s
principled VP annotation practices, marking
adjunction, complementation, and coordination
VP levels, which builds the flat adjunction con-
straint back into the structure of the head
daughter.
NP-NP modification, depicted in NNMÂ± in
Figure 4, was the most common error seen; the
greater prevalence of false positives is likely a
result of the overall PCFG parsing preference
for flatter structures. This type of parse am-
biguity is grounded in the semantic ambiguity
of compound noun interpretation. This seman-
tic ambiguity exists in English as well, as in the

ETB string commodity speculator Richard Den-
nis, but these structures are typically bracketed
flat in the ETB, underspecifying the semantic
relations relative to the CTB. In CTB parsing,
this type of ambiguity is difficult to resolve; dif-
ferent compound NP parses differ in dependency
structure, so the dependency model resolves er-
rors when word frequencies are large enough to
be reliable, but this is often not possible. We
found that the internal distributions of (i) NP
modifiers of NPs and (ii) left-modified NPs both
differ from the internal distribution of NPs in
general; we take advantage of this in the PCFG
model by marking both types (i) and (ii), which
reduces the bias against NP-NP modification in
compound NPs.
Prenominal modification errors, illustrated in
PNM of Figure 4, are rather infrequent, despite
the natural parallel with PP attachment ambi-
guity in English. Due to the highly articulated
structure of prenominal modifiers, it seems dif-
ficult to address this problem directly; one mea-
sure we found somewhat successful is to mark
IP daughters of prenominal modification.
Coordination scope errors occured in two ma-
jor varieties: those where the misattached right
conjunct is verbal (a VP or IP), and those where
it is nominal the latter case is illustrated in

ocal majority of low over high verbal attach-
ment errors contrasts qualitatively with ETB
parsing, where low attachment is more common
and parsers tend to err toward high attachment.
There are two major sources of ambiguous at-
tachment sites: (i) any VP can be parsed as
an IP plus a unary IPâNP, so due to pro-drop
any VP coordination is ambiguous with a higher
IP coordination; (ii) VPs are multilevel, giving
rise to ambiguities of scope over adjuncts. It
seems that (i) is a difficult problem; in some
cases, certain &amp;quot;discourse-level&amp;quot; adverbs such as
however and )E,42t_ A./especially prefer IP
modification and are thus strong indicators of
high attachment. To capture this we mark those
adverbs possessing an IP grandparent. We ad-
dress (ii) to some extent by marking VPs as
adjunction or complementation structures, as
shown before in Figure 5; in training data, only
like-type VPs are coordinated.
With nominal coordination scope errors, the
situation is different: we found no false low at-
tachments. False high scopings can be reduced
by marking NP conjuncts. (Charniak, 2000)
claims that a similar strategy proved effective
for WSJ parsing.
A related error arises from the introduction of
IPs by communication verbs and commas, as in
Figure 6. Only a few verbs in our training set
take IPs this way, so we address this ambigu-
ity with subcategorization annotation (Collins,
1999), marking VVs possessing IP sisters.
Most adjunction errors, such as into IP rather
than VP, are in principle semantically impotent,
since in both cases they are associated with the
same verbal head. In practice, however, many
adjuncts are NPs, and ambiguous adjunctions
into IP are superficially indistinguishable from
subjects due to pro-drop. NP adjuncts into VP
are not ambiguous in this way, and from in-
spection the annotation practice of the Chinese
Treebank appears to be to put NP adjuncts into
VP unless they are followed by an overt subject,
or otherwise distinguished as IP-level (e.g., have
scope over a clear IP coordination). This could
be dealt with in PCFG annotation in two ways.
One is to retain subject (and/or non-subject)
functional marking from the CTB. The other is
to mark VP adjuncts. In practice, we found that
the former hurt performance whereas the latter
helped somewhat.

4.2 Tagging mistakes relevant to
parsing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996584375">
The strongest mistagging tendency was to tag
verbs (VV) as common nouns (NN). Upon man-
ual examination, the asymmetry of N-as-V and
V-as-N mistagging frequency seems in line with
the global prior over POS tags; the overall N:V
ratio in the corpus is 2.5:1. We briefly explain
here why N/V ambiguity is a hard problem in
Chinese. All natural languages possess deriva-
tional means by which roots can switch between
nominal and verbal categories. When there is
overt morphological marking for these processes,
as is always the case in Russian or German (and
also as with Chinese and English suffixes such as
&apos;/-ify) there is no ambiguity. But the sparse
morphology of English and Chinese means that
frequently there is noun/verb ambiguity at the
word level. For English, most cases of this am-
biguity can be resolved by the linguist on the
basis of paradigmatic substitution in static con-
text: whether an instance of the word raise, for
example, is a noun or a verb can be quickly de-
termined by checking whether raised can be sub-
stituted in the same context. Chinese, on the
other hand, has no morphological paradigms, so
any test to determine the part of speech must be
made with syntagmatic substitution: whether
the word can take an adverbial modifier or a
prenominal modifier, for example.
In both languages, there are borderline cases,
but they are handled differently by the respec-
tive treebanks. In English, gerunds (VBG) have
both nominal and verbal properties. In the En-
glish Treebank, they have a single POS tag,
but their distribution overlaps with both nouns
and verbs, so that for example they can head
both NPs and VPs. In Chinese, on the other
hand, the tag assigned to N/V-ambiguous words
is determined by the external context, specifi-
cally their maximal phrase: with the exception
of domination by FRAG, all nouns are imme-
diately dominated by NP, and all verbs by VP.
To test the impact of Chinese Treebank N/V
tagging practices, we tried training the parser
with NN and VV training tags merged. This
yielded a 5.4% drop in Fl for the vanilla PCFG,
and a much smaller drop of 1.7% for the refined
model, suggesting at first glance that context
plus correct independence assumptions can com-
pensate for most of the distributional informa-
tion gained from N/V tag priors. But we also
tried the same experiment with the ETB using
the small training set and a vanilla PCFG, and
found, remarkably, practically no effect: preci-
sion increased by 0.06%, and recall decreased by
0.21%. Although this result calls for further in-
vestigation, we tentatively conclude that in En-
glish, for most N/V-ambiguous tokens, morphol-
ogy and POS prior contribute essentially noth-
ing that cannot be adduced from the token&apos;s
surrounding function-word context; whereas in
Chinese, it seems that the lack of function words
puts a much greater burden on prior knowledge
of an N/V-ambiguous word&apos;s distributional be-
havior.

fled several more PCFG refinements that reflect
linguistically motivated generalizations and im-
prove parsing performance. Generalizing from
the specific error classes analyzed in the pre-
vious section, a key problem in Chinese pars-
ing seems to be separating nonequivalent classes
of IP. Two major classes of ambiguity are in-
volved in IP membership: (i) the presence or
absence in IP of subjects and adjuncts; and (ii)
coordinate attachment of verbal material. We
found that these ambiguities were most effec-
tively dealt with by marking root IPs as well as
those in certain sister contexts. Again in this
case, CTB annotation practices introduce cate-
gory conflations that, when reified in a PCFG,
lead to false independence assumptions. For
example, the BA marker is descriptively used
in Chinese to preverbalize objects. Its syntax,
however, is controversial (Bender, 2001). In the
CTB, BA heads a VP and always has a unique
sister IP; but that IP essentially always rewrites
as NP VP. With these refinements of IP we
achieved another 0.4% in error reduction, for a
final development set figure of 82.1% LP, 83.1%
LR, and 82.6% Fl. We then ran the same model
on the test set used in previous work (Bikel and
Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel, 2002). Results
are shown in Table 4.

The trends we obtained are different enough
from previous work to merit discussion. As
shown in Table 4, previous work on CTB parsing
consistently achieved higher results on precision
than on recall. This is consonant with our ini-
tial experiments in CTB PCFG parsing: on the
development set, a vanilla PCFG showed a 7%
precision/recall split in favor of precision (the
split for our small WSJ training set is 4.2% in
the same direction). We suspect that this is due
to the low branching factor in the CTB, which
increases the potential reward from the parser&apos;s
perspective for picking flatter structures. Sim-
ply splitting punctuation along the lines of En-
glish, combined with PCFG markovization and
the introduction of a dependency model fac-
tor, reduced the LP/LR split to 1.1%. From
there to our final model, nearly all improve-
ment was in recall: precision improved by 0.3%
to the final figure, whereas recall jumped by
3.4%. We interpret these results as indicating
that we have unlocked a heretofore undiscov-
ered space of independence-assumption refine-
ments for CTB parsing, suggesting that there is
still considerable room for improvement in CTB
parsing even with a small (90,000-word) train-
ing set; a parser-combining model such as that
proposed in (Henderson and Brill, 1999), for ex-
ample, might be effective here.
This is an encouraging result for the use of
detailed error analysis followed by focused tree-
structure enhancements to improved parser per-
formance. However, we found two limitations to
our methodology. First, some important and ad-
dressable error types are relatively rare in Tree-
bank data. The 100-sentence chunk of develop-
ment data we chose to analyze simply did not
contain any instances of BA, discussed above in
Section 4.3, but errors involving BA occurred
three times elsewhere in the development set.
Second, some common error types are not the
result of simple and easily fixable shortcomings
in independence assumptions. In particular, we
found that coordination scoping ambiguity and
N/V tag ambiguity are major sources of rela-
tively catastrophic error for our parser. Inter-
estingly, coordination scope ambiguity is recog-
nized as perhaps the most recalcitrant problem
in ETB parsing, while many cases of N/V ambi-
guity are particularly difficult points of linguistic
analysis for Chinese, as discussed in Section 4.2.
For the future, we believe that there is still
room for considerable improvement in CTB
parsing under our model. In addition to fur-
ther PCFG refinements, tuning the dependency
model may lead to improved performance. We
found that head-dependent distances in the
CTB are larger than in the ETB, consistent with
the greater degree of center-embedding resulting
from the mixed headedness of Chinese, and sug-
gesting that a dependency model developed for
English may not be optimal for Chinese. Since
NP is right-headed while VP and IP are left-
headed, an improved dependency model may be
the best place to address at least one of the key
problems we have identified for CTB parsing.

<abstract confidence="0.994917333333333">We present a detailed investigation of the challenges posed when applying parsing models developed against English corpora to Chinese. We develop a factored-model statistical parser for the Penn Chinese Treebank, showing the implications of gross statistical differences between WSJ and Chinese Treebanks for the most general methods of parser adaptation. We then provide a detailed analysis of the major sources of statistical parse errors for this corpus, showing their causes and relative frequencies, and show that while some types of errors are due to difficult ambiguities inherent in Chinese grammar, others arise due to treebank annotation practices. We show how each type of error can be addressed with simple, targeted changes to the independence assumptions of the maximum likelihood-estimated PCFG factor of the parsing model, which raises our Fl from 80.7% to 82.6% on our development set, and achieves parse accuracy close to the best published figures for Chinese parsing. 1 Background Even narrow-coverage context-free natural language grammars produce explosive ambiguity (Church and Patil, 1982). Today&apos;s treebankderived broad-coverage CFGs generate even more, some of it genuine linguistic ambiguity and some of it artificial (see (Krotov et al., 1998) and (Johnson, 1998) for discussion). Corpusbased statistical parsing is a leading technique to deal with this extreme ambiguity; the vast bulk of work in this field has been done in English, using the Wall Street Journal section of the English Penn Treebank (ETB). State-ofthe-art statistical parsing techniques now handle most ambiguity adequately; the best statistical parsers for the ETB are now at roughly 90% labeled bracketing accuracy (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000). The remaining difficult-toresolve ambiguities are fairly well-understood for perhaps the best-known are flat embedded adjunction structures (see (John-</abstract>

More recently, however, a wider variety of parsed corpora has become available in other languages. We take advantage of the recently released Penn Chinese Treebank (version 2.0, abbreviated here as CTB; (Xue et al., 2002)) to address these questions for Chinese, a language with less morphology and more mixed headedness than English. Chinese, as we will show, has a rather different set of salient ambiguities from the perspective of statistical parsing. This section provides background on relevant linguistic differences between Chinese and English, and on relevant tree-structural differences between the two treebanks. 1.1 Linguistic differences between English and Chinese Chinese and English are both isolating languages: they rely primarily on relatively rigid phrase structure rather than rich morphological information to encode functional relations between elements. For purposes of statistical parsing, three salient differences distinguish the two languages. First, Chinese makes less use of function words and morphology than English: determinerless nouns are more widespread, plural marking is restricted and rare, and verbs appear in a unique form with few supporting function words. Second, whereas English is largely left-headed and right-branching, Chinese is more mixed: most categories are right-headed, but verbal and prepositional complements follow their heads (Figure 2). Significantly, this means that attachment ambiguity among a verb&apos;s complements, a major source of parsing ambiguity in is rare in Chinese. The third major difference is subject pro-drop the null realization of uncontrolled pronominal subjects which is widespread in Chinese, but rare in English. This creates ambiguities between parses of subjectless structures as IP (equivalent to ETB&apos;s S) or as VP, and between interpretations of preverbal NPs as NP adjuncts or as subjects. 1.2 Tree-Structural Differences between English and Chinese Treebanks The CTB consists of 325 newswire articles; 291 are on economic topics, 34 on politics and culture. Past work on CTB parsing (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel, 2002) has used articles 1-270 for training, 301-325 for development, and 271-300 for testing. We found, however, that this development set was uncharacteristic of the corpus as a whole and not ideal for development. As an extreme example, the word in it 28 times as a measure word, meaning &apos;point&apos;, twice as an adverb, and once as a verb; in the rest of the corpus it appears eight times as a verb, once as an adverb, and never as a measure word. There turns out to be a high concentration of articles on non-economic topics in 301-325 (the problem with *`arising from sports articles). Therefore, for this paper we set aside articles 1-25 for development and used 26-270 as training during development. During development, we found the difference in parse accuracy for 1-25 and 301-325 to range around a remarkable 10%. Whereas ETB annotation strongly reflects late 1970s mainstream transformational grammar, CTB annotation draws primarily on Government-Binding (GB) theory from the 1980s. GB differs from the former in two major respects: first, it rigidly requires phrasal projection of all lexical categories; second, it sharply distinguishes between levels of adjunction and complementation. Both these differences are noticeable when comparing treebanks. The first difference, projection of phrasal categories, is particularly prominent within NPs: CTB adjective-noun modification, for example, is always at the level of ADJP and NP, whereas in English it can be a direct rewrite of NP to JJ and NN tags (Figure 1). The second difference, distinction of adjunction and complementation levels, has been made only for VP (Figure 2), NP NP DT NN DP ADJP NP an risk DT JJ NN this I strange phenomenon type &amp;quot;an additional risk&amp;quot; &amp;quot;this type of strange phenomenon&amp;quot; Figure 1: Noun modification in English and Chinese Treebanks VP VBZ temporarily throws the work into chaos &amp;quot;temporarily throws the work into chaos&amp;quot; VP ADVP PP VP NP for profession AK* provide service &amp;quot;also provides service for the profession&amp;quot; Figure 2: VP adjunction and complementation consistent with the headedness issues described in Section 1.1. The rigid requirement of phrasal category projection is also manifest elsewhere: all Chinese prenominal relative-clause equivalents have a level of CP annotation, equivalent to ETB&apos;s SBAR, containing a null WH-NP, even though Chinese has no relative pronouns (the overt prenominal modification marker, Aiv , introduces another level of CP annotation when present, as seen in Figure 3, but in this case the unary CP is compressed under standard pre-parsing tree In the corresponding case for the ETB, reduced relative clauses are annotated as VPs. These annotation practices have a strong effect on the gross statistics of the CTB after standard tree normalizations for parsing. The CTB has far fewer rule types than an ETB of equivalent size, and has a considerably lower branching factor. In particular a far higher proportion of &apos;Standard tree normalizations are: the removal of empty nodes and nodes dominating no non-empty terminals, and the subsequent removal of A over A unaries.

Parent and grandparent annotation (Johnson, 1998) has a much stronger effect on training-data parsing for ETB than for CTB. We believe that the greater precision/recall split seen here for CTB is also due to its lower branching factor. 2 Parsing model We use the factored parsing model of (Klein and Manning, 2002). Parsing in this model involves combining two independent parses: one of a non-lexicalized, maximum likelihoodestimated (MLE) PCFG model and another of a constituent-free dependency parse. In addition to simplifying the parameterization of the parsing model and maintaining exactness, this is a randomly selected tenth of the full English Wall Street Journal corpus. model offers the prospect of increased flexibility in tuning the individual parse models. In particular, linguistic generalizations corresponding to category refinements are easily implemented via category-splitting in the PCFG model, without concern for affecting the dependency model. In adapting this parsing model to Chinese, we have retained unchanged the dependency model developed for English; the model backs off to and backoff parameters remain the In all cases, test input to the parser was segbut Our focus in parser development has been to refine the PCFG model via stepwise refinements informed by major observed ambiguity classes. We illustrate that each of these refinements can effectively be viewed as an amendment to the independence assumptions made by a simple PCFG. 3 PCFG development The simplest systematic augmentations to basic PCFG models are the inclusion of various types of contextual information in the structure of individual node labels. In principle, any contextual information could be used, but in practice two types are most heavily relied on: (i) information highly local to the enhanced node; and (ii) a unique preterminal/terminal identified as the the node. These practices have correlates in contemporary lintheory as principles of lexalgorithm to determine the of every non-terminal node is necessary for the dependency model and for grammar markovization (Collins, 1999), and since the CTB and ETB have different grammars, we did write a simple headfinder for the CTB grammar. unknown words we estimated P(wordltag) based on the first character of the word. foreign investment and Wasow, 1999). For headship, the choices of node enhancement strategy are fairly limited; for enrichment by local context, there are far more choices. Of the simplest local-context enrichment strategies, the one that has proven effective on a systematic bainvolves annotation; 1998) showed that when uniformly applied, it considerably improved WSJ Treebank parsing. Uniform enhancement by other local context, such as sisters, daughters, or cousins, quickly leads to unacceptable sparseness under MLE. To begin development, we tested the interaction of complete parent and/or grandparent annotation with PCFG markovization (see (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) for discussion). The indications for the utility of parent annotation in CTB parsing are mixed. The CTB is smaller and thus more susceptible to grammar fragmentation, but it is also less flat (see Table 1). We found that first-order markovization was superior to zero-order, second-order, and unmarkovized PCFGs for all levels of ancestor annotation, and that within first-order markovization parent annotation was slightly superior to no annotation, with grandparent annotation decidedly worse. 4 Error analysis for parser development Keeping in mind that less fragmented grammars are more robust to further category-splitting, we systematically investigated the major sources of error for the factored model with an unannotated first-order markov PCFG grammar whose only enrichment of CTB annotation was a refinement of punctuation tags along ETB lines, which achieved an Fl of 80.7%. To assess the major sources of parsing difficulty for Chinese, we tabulated frequencies of major types of parsing errors in a 100-sentence subset of our development set. Table 3 gives a breakdown of the major error types found; Figure 4 gives examof unfamiliar major error In the next section we describe each major error type, its causes, and suggest simple PCFG en-</abstract>

We address this error by taking advantage of the CTB&apos;s principled VP annotation practices, marking adjunction, complementation, and coordination VP levels, which builds the flat adjunction constraint back into the structure of the head daughter. NP-NP modification, depicted in NNMÂ± in Figure 4, was the most common error seen; the greater prevalence of false positives is likely a result of the overall PCFG parsing preference for flatter structures. This type of parse ambiguity is grounded in the semantic ambiguity of compound noun interpretation.

Starred examples are correct in corpus; alternates are parse errors. string speculator Richard Denthese structures are typically bracketed flat in the ETB, underspecifying the semantic relations relative to the CTB. In CTB parsing, this type of ambiguity is difficult to resolve; different compound NP parses differ in dependency structure, so the dependency model resolves errors when word frequencies are large enough to be reliable, but this is often not possible. We found that the internal distributions of (i) NP modifiers of NPs and (ii) left-modified NPs both differ from the internal distribution of NPs in general; we take advantage of this in the PCFG model by marking both types (i) and (ii), which reduces the bias against NP-NP modification in compound NPs. Prenominal modification errors, illustrated in PNM of Figure 4, are rather infrequent, despite the natural parallel with PP attachment ambiguity in English. Due to the highly articulated structure of prenominal modifiers, it seems difficult to address this problem directly; one measure we found somewhat successful is to mark IP daughters of prenominal modification. Coordination scope errors occured in two major varieties: those where the misattached right conjunct is verbal (a VP or IP), and those where it is nominal the latter case is illustrated in and CRDLN in Figure The equivverbal coordination is generally marked with commas, whereas nominal coordination is marked with conjoiners or the mostly noun-conjoining punctuation mark &amp;quot;, &amp;quot; IP NP heretofore unmet conditions NP IP IP NP VP IP PU IP PU IP NP VP he I I president may VV him say president may he I meet him 120, say Figure 6: Ambiguity between communication verb subcategorization frame (left; corpus) and high coordination attachment (right; incorrect parse). ocal majority of low over high verbal attachment errors contrasts qualitatively with ETB parsing, where low attachment is more common and parsers tend to err toward high attachment. There are two major sources of ambiguous attachment sites: (i) any VP can be parsed as an IP plus a unary IPâNP, so due to pro-drop any VP coordination is ambiguous with a higher IP coordination; (ii) VPs are multilevel, giving rise to ambiguities of scope over adjuncts. It seems that (i) is a difficult problem; in some cases, certain &amp;quot;discourse-level&amp;quot; adverbs such as IP modification and are thus strong indicators of high attachment. To capture this we mark those adverbs possessing an IP grandparent. We address (ii) to some extent by marking VPs as adjunction or complementation structures, as shown before in Figure 5; in training data, only like-type VPs are coordinated. With nominal coordination scope errors, the situation is different: we found no false low attachments. False high scopings can be reduced by marking NP conjuncts. (Charniak, 2000) claims that a similar strategy proved effective for WSJ parsing.</abstract>

Of the simplest local-context enrichment strategies, the one that has proven effective on a systematic basis involves parent annotation; (Johnson, 1998) showed that when uniformly applied, it considerably improved WSJ Treebank parsing. Uniform enhancement by other local context, such as sisters, daughters, or cousins, quickly leads to unacceptable sparseness under MLE. To begin development, we tested the interaction of complete parent and/or grandparent annotation with PCFG markovization (see (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) for discussion). The indications for the utility of parent annotation in CTB parsing are mixed. The CTB is smaller and thus more susceptible to grammar fragmentation, but it is also less flat (see Table 1). We found that first-order markovization was superior to zero-order, second-order, and unmarkovized PCFGs for all levels of ancestor annotation, and that within first-order markovization parent annotation was slightly superior to no annotation, with grandparent annotation decidedly worse. 4 Error analysis for parser development Keeping in mind that less fragmented grammars are more robust t</context>

We address (ii) to some extent by marking VPs as adjunction or complementation structures, as shown before in Figure 5; in training data, only like-type VPs are coordinated. With nominal coordination scope errors, the situation is different: we found no false low attachments. False high scopings can be reduced by marking NP conjuncts. (Charniak, 2000) claims that a similar strategy proved effective for WSJ parsing. A related error arises from the introduction of IPs by communication verbs and commas, as in Figure 6. Only a few verbs in our training set take IPs this way, so we address this ambiguity with subcategorization annotation (Collins, 1999), marking VVs possessing IP sisters. Most adjunction errors, such as into IP rather than VP, are in principle semantically impotent, since in both cases they are associated with the same verbal head.

The third major difference is subject pro-drop the null realization of uncontrolled pronominal subjects which is widespread in Chinese, but rare in English. This creates ambiguities between parses of subjectless structures as IP (equivalent to ETB&apos;s S) or as VP, and between interpretations of preverbal NPs as NP adjuncts or as subjects. 1.2 Tree-Structural Differences between English and Chinese Treebanks The CTB consists of 325 newswire articles; 291 are on economic topics, 34 on politics and culture. Past work on CTB parsing (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel, 2002) has used articles 1-270 for training, 301-325 for development, and 271-300 for testing. We found, however, that this development set was uncharacteristic of the corpus as a whole and not ideal for development. As an extreme example, the word *`- appears in it 28 times as a measure word, meaning &apos;point&apos;, twice as an adverb, and once as a verb; in the rest of the corpus it appears eight times as a verb, once as an adverb, and never as a measure word. There turns out to be a high concentration of articles on non-economic topics in 301-325 (the problem with *`- arising from sports articles). Ther</context>

For example, the BA marker is descriptively used in Chinese to preverbalize objects. Its syntax, however, is controversial (Bender, 2001). In the CTB, BA heads a VP and always has a unique sister IP; but that IP essentially always rewrites as NP VP. With these refinements of IP we achieved another 0.4% in error reduction, for a final development set figure of 82.1% LP, 83.1% LR, and 82.6% Fl. We then ran the same model on the test set used in previous work (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel, 2002). Results are shown in Table 4. 5 Results and Discussion The trends we obtained are different enough from previous work to merit discussion. As shown in Table 4, previous work on CTB parsing consistently achieved higher results on precision than on recall. This is consonant with our initial experiments in CTB PCFG parsing: on the development set, a vanilla PCFG showed a 7% precision/recall split in favor of precision (the split for our small WSJ training set is 4.2% in the same direction).

From there to our final model, nearly all improvement was in recall: precision improved by 0.3% to the final figure, whereas recall jumped by 3.4%. We interpret these results as indicating that we have unlocked a heretofore undiscovered space of independence-assumption refinements for CTB parsing, suggesting that there is still considerable room for improvement in CTB parsing even with a small (90,000-word) training set; a parser-combining model such as that proposed in (Henderson and Brill, 1999), for example, might be effective here. This is an encouraging result for the use of detailed error analysis followed by focused treestructure enhancements to improved parser performance. However, we found two limitations to our methodology. First, some important and addressable error types are relatively rare in Treebank data. The 100-sentence chunk of development data we chose to analyze simply did not contain any instances of BA, discussed above in Section 4.3, but errors involving BA occurred three times elsewhere in the development set.
