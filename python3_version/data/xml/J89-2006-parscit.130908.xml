This book is the fourth in the series Studies in Computer
Science and Artificial Intelligence and as such does
depend somewhat on the reader having a background in
computer science. However, there is so much stuff in
this eclectic book that almost anyone lacking special-
ized knowledge but with interests in artificial intelli-
gence, history, linguistics, computer science, or social
issues will find something to savor.
Computers and Languages consists of 13 chapters
divided into five parts, namely: &amp;quot;Introduction&amp;quot; (history
of computers, introduction to computability and formal
language theory, and an introduction to intelligent ap-
plications and Al); &amp;quot;Military Background&amp;quot; (impact of
computers on military needs and space and military
applications of Al); &amp;quot;Viewpoints on Language&amp;quot; (intro-
duction to generative grammar and associated issues
such as acquisition, competence, performance, psycho-
logical validity and parsing, BNF programming and
computer languages, and formal languages and parsing
methods); &amp;quot;From Language to Intelligence&amp;quot; (a survey
of natural language understanding systems from BASE-
BALL on, including interfaces and expert system ap-
plications, a variety of approaches such as ATNs, case
grammar, Schank&apos;s conceptual dependency, Wino-
grad&apos;s SHRDLU, semantic networks and frames, and
natural language applications: interfaces, machine
translation, and military applications including speech
processing); and &amp;quot;The Military-Industrial-Academic
Complex (University Research and the Military)&amp;quot;.
The author notes in the preface (p. x) that the book
is not intended to be a textbook although he has used
parts of it in courses on computational linguistics,
computers and society, and formal approaches to Ian-
guages. The weakest parts of the book are in linguistics-
related areas. Although the book was published in 1988,
transformational theory, as represented by Chomsky&apos;s
standard theory circa 1970, is described but not much
beyond. The extended standard theory is mentioned,
two sentences cover government binding, and there is
one sentence each for lexical-functional grammar and
generalized phrase structure grammar. No mention is
made of the very important recent work in logic gram-
mars, especially unification grammars. When program-
ming languages for natural language are discussed (pp.
314-316), Lisp is briefly introduced (a few sentences),
followed by a description of Planner (two pages), a
language only of interest to Al archaeologists. Nothing
is said of Prolog and its growing importance.
Because so many diverse topics are covered, an
accusation of superficiality cannot be entirely avoided.
Nevertheless, there are redeeming features in this book.
It does provide a useful introduction to the diverse
aspects of natural language understanding, including
both formal and applications-oriented perspectives. It is
rich in history, in the people and places involved in the
major contributions. However, what is unique and most
admirable about this book is the author&apos;s concern about
the role of government, especially the military, in
academic research in Al, especially natural language
understanding. One cautionary remark should be made,
however, that the entire discussion, except for two
paragraphs, is framed in the context of the U.S. military
enterprise as if in no other countries do the military
establishments influence the directions of research in
computer science. It may be the case that this process is
most accelerated in the U.S., but surely Western Eu-
rope, Japan, and the Soviet Union cannot be far behind.
Nijholt has performed a valuable service in remind-
ing researchers how intimately they have become in-
volved in military research. Witness the following quo-
tation from Jane&apos;s Defence Weekly, 17 May 1986:
The market has become so vast that there is plenty of
room for competent companies now that AI is well on the
way from academia to the battlefield. (p. 145)
The final chapter of the book, &amp;quot;University Research
and the Military&amp;quot;, presents a concise description of
&amp;quot;collaboration&amp;quot; between academia and the military,
including such areas as the cold war, the Vietnam War,
and those currently favored ventures, Star Wars and the
Strategic Computer Initiative. With respect to profes-
sional responsibility and war research, Nijholt quotes
relevant sections of the ACM&apos;s Code of Professional
Conduct, perhaps in hopes of reforming the recalcitrant
mercenary researcher.
This book is a concrete example of the word
&amp;quot;eclectic&amp;quot;. Although generally well laid out, it does
have a major drawback that seriously interferes with
ease of use: There is no subject index, though there is a
name index. In addition, references appear only at the
end of each chapter, thus requiring the use of the name

defined readership but it gathers so much useful and
interesting information in one place that it is well worth
having if the reader is prepared to deal with the defi-
ciences mentioned above.

Schiffer&apos;s book is a devastating critique of analytical
philosophy of language. The author aims at undermining
the philosopher&apos;s confidence in the facts about language
and thought that are usually taken as uncontroversial
starting points. Schiffer argues that the questions that
now define philosophy of language have false presup-
positions and that the most prominent philosophical
theories related to those questions are hopeless endeav-
ors.
In the past years Schiffer was much taken with
Grice&apos;s program, i.e., with the idea of &amp;quot;reducing the
semantic to the psychological by first defining speaker-
meaning in terms of certain species of semantical be-
haviour whose specification did not itself involve any-
thing semantical, and then defining expression-meaning
in terms of the reduced notion of speaker-meaning&amp;quot; (p.
xiii). Now Schiffer says that this program of intention-
based semantics (IBS) is impossible to implement for it is
impossible to account for the content of beliefs in a
language-independent way and to state propositional-
attitude facts in sentences devoid of mentalistic idioms.
In trying to deal with such negative conclusions, Schif-
fer came to forsake a great amount of what most
philosophers of language still accept, and was drawn to
the conclusion that such hypotheses as the existence of
semantic facts and compositionality of meaning are
misleading. The book is therapeutic rather than con-
structive: it belongs to the trend beginning with Witt-
genstein&apos;s Philosophical Investigations (1953), and con-
tinued, more recently, by Richard Rorty&apos;s Philosophy
and the Mirror of Nature (1979). It doesn&apos;t propose a
new theory of meaning, but it puts the analytical phi-
losophers in a critical position by attacking their profes-
sional role and their conceptual schemes.
I think that this book will be interesting even for
people approaching it from an Al or computational
linguistics perspective, for many of the philosophical
topics discussed here can&apos;t be ignored by computational
linguists concerned with semantic interpretation: e.g.,
analysis of belief and modal sentences, recognition of
speaker&apos;s intentions, and compositionality of natural
languages. I can&apos;t discuss all of them here, so I&apos;ll
concentrate on the last one, which according to me
should be a central issue for any theory of natural
language understanding (NLU). Schiffer&apos;s idea that the
semantics of natural language is not compositional is
hard to accept, for it seems too tied to his refusal of IBS.
Nevertheless, I think that his view can offer us some
positive insights. Until now, research in NLU has been
notably successful mainly in the area of syntax. The
analysis of the meanings of the words has no firm
foundation in the works of the computational commu-
nity: most of the computational semantic analysis is still
close to the procedural paradigm of the late &apos;60s.
Recently Graeme Hirst (1987) stressed this situation and
pointed out that compositionality should be an impor-
tant desideratum for a theory claiming to provide such
foundations.
Compositionality is the principle according to which
the semantic value of a sentence depends on those of its
parts. Within philosophy of language it is known as
Frege&apos;s Principle, and is regarded as an adequacy crite-
rion for semantic theories of natural languages. It is not
surprising, therefore, that Schiffer&apos;s attempt to under-
mine the theoretical basis of the philosophy of language
also involves the rejection of the compositionality prin-
ciple. More precisely, Schiffer comes to deny &amp;quot;the
reason for supposing that natural languages have com-
positional semantics&amp;quot;(p. xvi), after having argued that
the relational theory of propositional attitude is false. In
fact, Schiffer says:
On the one hand, it would appear that if, as many
suppose, natural languages have compositional, truth-
theoretic semantics, then the relational theory of propo-
sitional attitudes must be correct; while, on the other
hand, I have argued that the relational theory is false. I
must therefore deny that the relational construal of
&amp;quot;believes&amp;quot; is required by its accommodation within a
compositional semantics, or else deny that natural lan-
guages have compositional semantics. I opt for the latter
course. (p. xviii)
Schiffer&apos; s position seems to be close to the widely held
opinion that compositionality is unmaintainable if one
denies the relational thesis on propositional attitudes.
But he also seems to argue for a more substantial thesis,
i.e., for the idea that compositionality is not a feature of
natural language semantics. Schiffer admits that corn-
positionality might seem a good way to account for the
ability of native speakers to understand utterances of
novel sentences:
