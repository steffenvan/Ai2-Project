ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999928181818182">
Logical approaches to linguistic description, particu-
larly those which employ feature structures, have generally
treated phonology as though it was the same as orthography.
This approach breaks down for languages where the phono-
logical shape of a morpheme can be heavily dependent on
the phonological shape of another, as is the case in Ara-
bic. In this paper we show how the tense logical approach
investigated by Blackburn (1989) can be used to encode
hierarchical and temporal phonological information of the
kind explored by Bird (1990). Then we show how some
Arabic morphemes may be represented and combined&apos;.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993833333333">
There is an increasingly widespread view that linguis-
tic behaviour results from the complex interaction of mul-
tiple sources of partial information. This is exemplified
by the rapidly growing body of work on natural language
syntax and semantics such as the Unification-Based Gram-
mar Formalisms. Similarly, in phonology there is a popular
view of phonological representations as having the same
topology as a spiral-bound notebook, where segments (or
slots) are strung out along the spine and each page gives a
structural description of that string according to some de-
scriptive vocabulary. Crucially only those segmental strings
which are licensed by all of the independent descriptions
are acceptable.
The practical difficulty is to come up with a model of
grammatical organization which allows the right informa-
tion to be brought to bear at the right stage. One model
which looks particularly attractive in this regard considers
the traditional modules of grammar (i.e. syntax, seman-
tics and phonology) not in series where the output of one
feeds into the input of the next, but rather in parallel, where
each module exerts independent constraints. For example, a
morpheme may be represented as a complex consisting of a
semantic expression, a constraint on (morpho)syntactic dis-
tribution, and a phonological description. The combination
of morphemes is then subject to three independent calculi,
one per domain. The result is a compositional account of
the relationship between form and meaning, as evidenced
in the work of Bach (1983), Hoeksema &amp; Janda (1988)
and Wheeler (1988). However, all these proposals have as-
sumed that phonological representations are merely linear

sequences of segments. Such a restriction renders a theory
incapable of expressing the observations which have been
inade in the non-linear phonology literature (e.g. Goldsmith
1990). Bird &amp; Klein (1990) and Bird (1990) have endeav-
oured to show how the compositional approach can be lib-
erated from a purely linear segmental view of phonology.
This paper exemplifies and extends those proposals.
The first section presents a logical language for phono-
logical description. The second section shows how it has
sufficient expressive power to encompass a variety of obser-
vations about syllable structure. The final section discusses
further observations which can be made about Arabic syl-
lable structure, and provides an illustrative treatment of so-
called non-concatenative morphology in the perfect tense
verb paradigm.

LOGICAL FRAMEWORK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996878">
Interval based tense logics are calculi of temporal rea-
soning in which propositions are assigned truth values over
extended periods of time2. Three operators F (future), P
(past) and 0 (overlaps) are introduced: FO means &amp;quot;0 will
be the case (at least once)&amp;quot;, Pq5 means &amp;quot;0 was the case (at
least once)&amp;quot; and 00 means &amp;quot;0 is the case at some over-
lapping interval (at least once)&amp;quot;. 0 corresponds to what
phonologists call &apos;association&apos;. Typically sentences are true
at some intervals and not at others. (This is obviously the
case, for example, if 0 encodes the proposition &amp;quot;the sun
is shining&amp;quot;.) Blackburn (1989) has explored the effects of
adding of a new type of symbol, called nominals, to tense
logic. Unlike ordinary propositions, nominals are only ever
true once. In a sense, a nominal is a &apos;name&apos; (or a &apos;tem-
poral indexical&apos;) for that unique period of time at which it
is true. Certain observations about time can only be ex-
pressed in a theory which employs nominals. For example,
i —&apos;Fl picks out precisely the irreflexive time flows,
whereas no formula containing only propositional variables
can do this. Nominals have been employed in the analysis
of temporal reference in linguistic semantics. The present
paper illustrates an application of nominals to a very differ-
ent domain, namely phonology. In addition to F, P and 0,
we shall employ the modality 0 to represent phonological
dominance3.

survey of a variety of possible formulations of temporal structure.
3 The notion of dominance as employed in phonology corre-
sponds closely to the use of the term in feature logics. However,
we treat dominance as a relation rather than as a collection of par-
tial functions, for two reasons. First, in phonological structures, it
is the nodes and not the arcs which are labelled. Second, there can
be multiple arcs emanating from a node.

We define 4-0 and A as usual. We also define the duals
of our modal operators in the usual fashion: GO
(0 is always going to be the case), HO F. -.P-vb (0 always
has been the case), C0 (40 holds at all overlap-
ping intervals) and 00 a- (0 is true at all &apos;daughter&apos;
intervals). Two additional defined operators will play an im-
portant role in what follows: Mç6 PO V 00 V F4., and
its dual L0 --111/1-4. It follows from the semi-linear time
semantics adopted below that M0 means &apos;0 holds at some
time&apos; and LO means &apos;0 holds at all times&apos;. We will often
abbreviate 0(p A 0) using the expression (p)0 and abbre-
viate a sequence of such applications (p1) • • • (pn)4. using
the expression (pi • • • p)4). We adopt a similar practice
for the dual forms: [p]4&apos; is shorthand for 0(p 0) and
fp, • • • pnit,5 is shorthand for [pi ] • • • [NW We also write
On (or 0&amp;quot;) to stand for a length n sequence of Os (or Os).
Semantics. Let T be a set of intervals (which we will think
of as nodes), and let 6, &lt; and o be binary relations on T.
As &lt; models temporal precedence, it must be irreflexive
and transitive. o models temporal overlap (phonological
association), and so it is reflexive and symmetric. &lt; and
o interact as follows: (i) they are disjoint, (ii) for any
t2, 23, 14 E T, ti &lt; t2 o 13 &lt; 24 implies ti &lt; 2.1 (that is,
precedence is transitive through overlap), and (iii) for any
11, 12 E T, ti &lt; /2 or ti 012 or ti &gt; 12 (that is, our concep-
tion of time is semi-linear). Note that the triple (T,&lt;, o)
is what temporal logicians call an interval structure.
The remaining relation b encodes the hierarchical or-
ganization of phonological structures. As a phonological
unit overlaps all of its constituents (cf. Hayes 1990:44), we
demand that the transitive closure of .5 be contained within
o. Furthermore, phonological structures are never cyclic
and so we require that for any 11, ,2, E T, if 11522, . • ..
Si,, then it is not the case that tnbti . By a phonolog-
ical frame .7- we mean a quadruple (T, &lt;0, 6) of the type
just described.
It merely remains to link L with such structures. A
valuation is a function (X Li N) 2&amp;quot; that obeys three
constraints. First, it must assign a singleton set to each
nominal. Second, for each t E T, there is an i E N such
that V(i) = (t). Third, if ti ,12 E N(p) where p E X
then ti o t2 ti = 12. In short, valuations are functions
which ensure nominals act as names, where all intervals
are named, and valuations capture the idea that phonological
&apos;tiers&apos; are linearly ordered. A model for L is a pair (9,&apos;V).

matrices. For example:

Sort Lattices. Node labels in phonologists&apos; diagrams (e.g.
see example (1)) can be thought of as classifications. For
example, we can think of A E X as denoting a certain
class of nodes in a phonological structure (the mora nodes).
Moras may be further classified into onset moras and coda
moras, which are written as Ao and Ac respectively. The
relationship between A, ito and Ac can then be expressed
using the following formulas:
L(A «-+ Ao V Ac) L(A0 A AC
Such constraints are Boolean constraints. For example, a
simple Boolean lattice validating the two formulas con-
cerning moras above is ( {A, Ao, Ac,1} ; tco n Ac =
Ao U = ). This is depicted as a diagram as follows:
Each element of X appears as a node in the diagram. The
join (u) of two sorts p and q is the unique sort found by
following lines upwards from p and q until they first con-
nect, and conversely for the meet (n). For convenience,
constraints on node classifications will be depicted using
lattice diagrams of the above form. Trading on the fact that
L contains propositional calculus, Boolean constraints can
be uniformly expressed in L as follows:
(i) p q = r becomes L(p A q r)
(ii) pUq=r becomes L(p V q 4-0 r)
Appropriateness Constraints. As we shall see, the hi-
erarchical prosodic structures of phonology are highly con-
strained. For example, syllables dominate moras and not the
other way around, and so a structure where there is a mora
dominating a syllable is ill-formed. Following (Bird 1990),
we express these restrictions on dominance by augmenting
the sort lattice with a binary &apos;appropriateness&apos; relation A,
represented graphically using arrows. We can express in
L the constraints captured by such appropriateness graphs.
For example, L(p --+ -00q) expresses the fact that a node
with sort p cannot dominate a node with sort q. We can
also use L to express stronger constraints. For example,
L(p 0q) expresses the fact that a node of sort p must
dominate at least one node of sort q. In short, the 0 oper-
ator allows us to express graphical constraints.

A THEORY OF PHONOLOGY

A phonological theory is a collection of generalizations
expressed in a language of the above logic. We choose as
our language X = a, 6h, ai. co, crc. crho, cr hc• 010, crlc,
110. pc. 7r, b, d, l, J, It, n, r, s, t, w, ?, a, u, I. The
nine a symbols are for the classification of syllables into
heavy vs. light and open vs. closed and their various cross
classifications. We have already been introduced to A. Ao
and pc, for moras, onsets and codas respectively. The re-
maining symbols are classifications of segments (r), firstly
into vowels (w1,) vs. consonants (7c), and then into the
individual segments themselves (in boldface). This classi-
fication is depicted in (2) below.

We can describe these pictures using formulas from L. For
example, (1c) is described by the formula:
a A (u)(Fj A (r)t A (r)(a A i)) A (p)(j A (r)i A (r)t)
It is possible to use formulas from L to describe ill-formed
syllable structures. We shall rule these out by stating in L
our empirical generalizations. We begin by specifying (i)
the relationship between the sorts (i.e. the set X) using a
sort lattice and (ii) how the sorts interact with dominance
using an appropriateness relation. We then express in L the
constraints graphically represented in the appropriateness
graph in (2).

The arrows may be glossed as follows: (i) all syl-
lables must dominate an onset mora, (ii) heavy syllables
must dominate a coda mora and (iii) all moras must dom-
inate a segment. The fact that potential arrows are absent
also encodes constraints. For example: (i) syllables, moras
and segments alike cannot dominate syllables and (ii) light
syllables do not have coda moras. Constraints concern-
ing the number of nodes of sort p that a node of sort q can
dominate, and constraints concerning temporal organization
cannot be stated in this graphical style. Nevertheless, they
can be expressed in L as follows.
(Al) 4(100 —1. [A0]0). Owes are unique.
5See (Bird 1990) for arguments justifying this view of syllable
structure. Moras are traditionally employed in the representation of
syllable weight: a syllable with two moms is heavy, and a syllable
with one mora is light.

An interesting alternative is to add an operator0-1 that
looks backwards along the dominance relation6. The con-
straint that two syllables cannot share a mora could then
be written L(p A ()-10 [(yr&apos; 0). There are further
phonological phenomena which suggest that this may be an
interesting extension of L to explore. For example, the re-
quirement that all moras and segments must be linked to the
hierarchical structure (prosodic licensing) may be expressed
thus: L((it V 7) 0-1T).
Partiality. Crucially for the analysis of Arabic, it is pos-
sible to have a formula which describes more than one di-
agram. Consider the formula M(a A (a, 7r)(t A Fi)) A
M (a A (p, ir)(a A i)), which may be glossed &apos;there is a syl-
lable which dominates a t, and a syllable which dominates
an a, and the t is before the a&apos;. This formula describes the

There are certain phonological phenomena which appear to
move us beyond the bounds of L: the need to specify de-
faults. Phonologists often employ default consonants and
vowels, which appear when the consonant or vowel posi-
tions in syllable structures have not been filled. In Arabic,
the default consonant is ? (the glottal stop) and the default
vowel is a. The default consonant only appears word ini-
tially. There are two ways we can treat such defaults. First,
we can regard them as instructions on how one ought to
&apos;compute&apos; with L. That is, we regard them as instructions
to attempt to build certain preferred models. Alternatively,
we could combine L with a default logic.

Consonant Doubling. In conjugations IX, XI, XII, XIV
and QIV there is a non-geminate doubling of consonants.
In the exceedingly rare XII, the second consonant (t) is dou-
bled. In all the other cases, the final consonant is doubled.
The most direct solution is to posit a lexical rule which
freely applies to consonantisms, doubling their final con-
sonant. For example, the rule would take the (KTB) form
provided above and produce:

It would be necessary to prevent this extended form from
being used in conjugations II and V. since the patterns
katbab and takatbab are unattested.
The Reflexive Affix. Conjugations V, VI and vin are
marked by thopresence of a reflexive affix t. Rather than
viewing these conjugations as basic (as Figure 1 implies),
we can treat them as having been derived from conjuga-
tions II, III and I respectively. As this affix always ap-
pears as the onset of a light syllable, we shall represent it
thus: M(o-1 A (A, r)t). This morpheme will actually be
expressed lexically as a function from conjugations to con-
jugations which attaches a syllable of the above form to
the existing phonological material of a conjugation. The
affix must be ordered relative to the other syllables. A con-
straint encoding the observation that all conjugations end
in a closed syllable would prevent the affix from being a
suffix. The fact that the affix is a light syllable correctly
rules out ktattab (V) and ktaatab (VI), leaving only the at-
tested forms for (V) and (VI). A constraint which prevented
the first two syllables of a conjugation both being light (cf.
McCarthy 1981:387), easily expressed in L. would rule out
takatab (VIII) leaving only the attested form for (VIII).
Extrametricallty. Above we specified conjugation If as
having a closed final syllable. Looking back at Figure 1, it
would appear as if all conjugations end in a closed syllable.
However, a study of the inflected forms reveals that this
is not the case. For example, the third person plural of
kattab is kattabu. From (T11), the b must be syllabified
with the vowel to its right. However, the first person plural
(5)
- 93 -
is kattabna, and the b is syllabified with the vowel to its
left. Similarly, the s of staktab is not part of the syllable
tak. It is actually the coda of a previous syllable. In order
to pronounce this form, ?I is prefixed, producing ?istaktab.
Therefore, the conjugations are not merely sequences
of complete syllable templates, but rather they are sequences
bounded by unsyllabified (or extrametrical) consonants. The
definition of II should therefore be modified to be Mac A
M (cr A (p0)) A M (a A (u)) 1°. This is intended to leave
open the possibility for the final consonant to be syllab-
ified with the second syllable or with the third syllable,
while simultaneously requiring it to ultimately be syllabi-
fied somewhere.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999166136363636">
In this article we have presented an application of inter-
val based tense logic to &apos;non-linear&apos; phonology (specifically,
&apos;autosegmental&apos; phonology, Goldsmith 1990), and exempli-
fied it using data from Arabic (McCarthy 1981). The chief
difference between this view of phonology and its purely
segmental predecessors is its use of overlapping intervals
of time.
As argued in (Bird 1990), the three primitives: dom-
inance, precedence and overlap are sufficient to represent
hierarchically and temporally organized phonological struc-
ture. Here we have taken a standard language of interval
based tense logic, augmented it with an extra operator 0 to
express phonological dominance, and employed nominals
to enable us to label nodes. A universal theory of syllable
structure was expressed in L, to which further generaliza-
tions were added for Arabic. We then showed how so-called
`non-concatenative&apos; morphology might be treated, and in-
dicated how the phonological notions of extrametricality
and licensing were cashed out. The analysis of Arabic did
not require recourse to separate consonant and vowel tiers
(following Hudson 1986). Rather, consonantisms (and vo-
calisms) are simply partially specified phonological struc-
tures which may be combined using logical conjunction.
Even so, the exemplification given was for but a tiny frag-
ment of Arabic phonology and much work is still to be
done. For example, nothing was said about the vocalisms.
The move from linear to non-linear phonology paral-
lels the move from a purely Priorean tense logic in F and
P to interval based systems in F, P and 0. The view of
phonology emerging from the present study is significantly
more formal than many of its contemporaries (cf. Bird &amp;
Ladd 1991), and suggests that enhanced modal formalisms
may provide a natural foundation for rigorous phonological
theorizing.
Finally, there would seem to be good reasons for being
confident that complex phonological descriptions can now
be fully incorporated into feature structure based grammar
frameworks. Reape&apos;s (1991) logical foundation for these
frameworks and the phonological arguments in favour of
adopting feature structures (Hayes 1990, Bird 1991) are but
two parts of the one story.
I°Note that the exhaustiveness condition L(o. -+ i V j) and
the sequencing constraints in the earlier version of (II) must be
expressed here also. They are omitted for the sake of readability.

For convenience, constraints on node classifications will be depicted using lattice diagrams of the above form. Trading on the fact that L contains propositional calculus, Boolean constraints can be uniformly expressed in L as follows: (i) p q = r becomes L(p A q r) (ii) pUq=r becomes L(p V q 4-0 r) Appropriateness Constraints. As we shall see, the hierarchical prosodic structures of phonology are highly constrained. For example, syllables dominate moras and not the other way around, and so a structure where there is a mora dominating a syllable is ill-formed. Following (Bird 1990), we express these restrictions on dominance by augmenting the sort lattice with a binary &apos;appropriateness&apos; relation A, represented graphically using arrows. We can express in L the constraints captured by such appropriateness graphs. For example, L(p --+ -00q) expresses the fact that a node with sort p cannot dominate a node with sort q. We can also use L to express stronger constraints. For example, L(p 0q) expresses the fact that a node of sort p must dominate at least one node of sort q. In short, the 0 operator allows us to express graphical constraints. A THEORY OF PHONOLOGY A phonologic</context>

The fact that potential arrows are absent also encodes constraints. For example: (i) syllables, moras and segments alike cannot dominate syllables and (ii) light syllables do not have coda moras. Constraints concerning the number of nodes of sort p that a node of sort q can dominate, and constraints concerning temporal organization cannot be stated in this graphical style. Nevertheless, they can be expressed in L as follows. (Al) 4(100 —1. [A0]0). Owes are unique. 5See (Bird 1990) for arguments justifying this view of syllable structure.

Typically sentences are true at some intervals and not at others. (This is obviously the case, for example, if 0 encodes the proposition &amp;quot;the sun is shining&amp;quot;.) Blackburn (1989) has explored the effects of adding of a new type of symbol, called nominals, to tense logic. Unlike ordinary propositions, nominals are only ever true once. In a sense, a nominal is a &apos;name&apos; (or a &apos;temporal indexical&apos;) for that unique period of time at which it is true. Certain observations about time can only be expressed in a theory which employs nominals. For example, i —&apos;Fl picks out precisely the irreflexive time flows, whereas no formula containing only propositional variables can do this. Nominals have been employed in the analysis of temporal reference in linguistic semantics. The pre</context>

The definition of II should therefore be modified to be Mac A M (cr A (p0)) A M (a A (u)) 1°. This is intended to leave open the possibility for the final consonant to be syllabified with the second syllable or with the third syllable, while simultaneously requiring it to ultimately be syllabified somewhere. CONCLUSION In this article we have presented an application of interval based tense logic to &apos;non-linear&apos; phonology (specifically, &apos;autosegmental&apos; phonology, Goldsmith 1990), and exemplified it using data from Arabic (McCarthy 1981). The chief difference between this view of phonology and its purely segmental predecessors is its use of overlapping intervals of time. As argued in (Bird 1990), the three primitives: dominance, precedence and overlap are sufficient to represent hierarchically and temporally organized phonological structure. Here we have taken a standard language of interval based tense logic, augmented it with an extra operator 0 to express phonological dominance, and employed nominals to enable us to label nodes.

Here we have taken a standard language of interval based tense logic, augmented it with an extra operator 0 to express phonological dominance, and employed nominals to enable us to label nodes. A universal theory of syllable structure was expressed in L, to which further generalizations were added for Arabic. We then showed how so-called `non-concatenative&apos; morphology might be treated, and indicated how the phonological notions of extrametricality and licensing were cashed out. The analysis of Arabic did not require recourse to separate consonant and vowel tiers (following Hudson 1986). Rather, consonantisms (and vocalisms) are simply partially specified phonological structures which may be combined using logical conjunction. Even so, the exemplification given was for but a tiny fragment of Arabic phonology and much work is still to be done. For example, nothing was said about the vocalisms. The move from linear to non-linear phonology parallels the move from a purely Priorean tense logic in F and P to interval based systems in F, P and 0. The view of phonology emerging from the present study is significantly more formal than many of its contemporaries (cf. Bird &amp; Ladd 1991</context>
