YARN (Yet Another RussNet) project
started in 2013 aims at creating a large
open thesaurus for Russian using crowd-
sourcing. This paper describes synset
assembly interface developed within the
project —motivation behind it, design, us-
age scenarios, implementation details, and
first experimental results.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99757447826087">
Creation of linguistic resources and annotations
using crowdsourcing and gamification is becom-
ing a common practice. Untrained workers con-
tribute to development of thesauri, dictionaries,
translation memories, and corpora annotations.
Crowdsourcing can employ both paid workers,
e.g. on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) plat-
form1 and volunteers as in case of Wiktionary2 —
a large wiki-style online multilingual dictionary.
The goal of the YARN (Yet Another RussNet)
project3 launched in 2013 is to create a large open
thesaurus for Russian language using crowdsourc-
ing (Braslavski et al., 2013). Despite the fact
that there were several attempts to create a Rus-
sian Wordnet (Azarova et al., 2002; Balkova et al.,
2004; Gelfenbein et al., 2003; Loukachevitch and
Dobrov, 2002), there is no open resource of ac-
ceptable quality and coverage currently available.
The choice of crowdsourcing is also advocated by
successful projects that are being evolved by vol-
unteers: Russian Wiktionary4, corpus annotation
project OpenCorpora5 and a wiki for linguistic re-
sources related to Russian NLPub6.

Wordnets had been traditionally developed
within small research teams. This approach main-
tains conceptual consistency and project manage-
ability, facilitates informal exchange of ideas in a
small group of contributors. However, this prac-
tice is hardly scalable and can potentially lead
to a biased description of linguistic phenomena
caused by the preferences of a close group of
researchers. Crowdsourcing can possibly reduce
costs, increase development pace, and make the
results more robust, but puts additional demands
on project management and tools, including user
interface. Requirements for a crowdsourcing the-
saurus development interface are as follows: 1) a
low entry threshold for new users and a gradual
learning curve; 2) no need for users to install addi-
tional software; 3) central data storage, collabora-
tive work for several users in a competitive mode,
and permission management; 4) change history
tracking to protect data against vandalism.
Princeton WordNet editors had worked directly
with lexicographer files stored in a version control
system (Fellbaum, 1998). In later thesauri creation
projects specialized tools were developed that fea-
tured more user-friendly interface, graphical rep-
resentation of thesaurus relationships, centralized
data storage, possibility of collaborative work, and
data consistency checks. Examples of thesauri
development tools are DEBVisDic (Hor´ak et al.,
2006), GernEdiT (Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010), as
well as WordNetLoom (Piasecki et al., 2012) (see
(Piasecki et al., 2012) for a brief overview of the-
sauri editing tools). Wiktionary and OmegaWiki7
use MediaWiki engine and wiki markup to encode
dictionary information.
In the preparatory stage of the project we con-
sidered adoption of the above mentioned tools.
However, we estimated that the amount of work
needed for adaptation of existing tools to YARN

2 Project Outline
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951157894737">
YARN is conceptually similar to Princeton Word-
net (Fellbaum, 1998) and its followers: it con-
sists of synsets — groups of quasi-synonyms cor-
responding to a concept. Concepts are linked
to each other, primarily via hierarchical hy-
ponymic/hypernymic relationships. According to
the project’s outline, YARN contains nouns, verbs,
and adjectives. We aim at splitting the process of
thesaurus creation into smaller tasks and develop-
ing custom interfaces for each of them. The first
step is an online tool for building noun synsets
based on content of existing dictionaries. The goal
of this stage is to establish YARN core content,
test and validate crowdsourcing approach, prepare
annotated data for automatic methods, and create
a basis for the work with the other parts of speech.
As mentioned above, important characteristics
of the project are its openness and recruitment of
volunteers. Our crowdsourcing approach is differ-
ent, for example, from the one described in (Bie-
mann and Nygaard, 2010), where AMT turkers
form synsets using the criterion of contextual sub-
stitutability directly. In our case, editors assem-
ble synsets using word lists and definitions from
dictionaries as “raw material”. Obviously, such
a task implies minimal lexicographical skills and
is more complicated than an average task offered
to AMT workers. Our target editors are college
or university students, preferably from linguistics
departments, who are native Russian speakers. It
is desirable that students are instructed by a uni-
versity teacher and may seek their advice in com-
plex cases. As in the case of Wikipedia and Wik-
tionary, we foresee two levels of contributors: line
editors and administrators with the corresponding
privileges. According to our expectations, the to-
tal number of line editors can reach two hundreds
throughout a year.

3 Raw Materials for YARN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998936">
We used two sources of “raw materials” for
YARN: 1) Russian Wiktionary and 2) Small
Academic Dictionary (SAD). Russian Wiktionary
dump as of March 2012 was parsed and con-
verted to database format using Wikokit software
(Krizhanovsky and Smirnov, 2013). Wiktionary
dump contains 51,028 nouns, including 45,646
single-word nouns; 30,031 entries have at least
one definition. Besides the words and definitions
Wiktionary dump contains occasionally synonym
references and word usage examples. SAD data
contain 33,220 word entries and 51,676 defini-
tions. All single-word nouns were provided with
frequencies based on the Russian National Cor-
pus8.

4 User Interface
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983734516129032">
The current synset editing interface can be ac-
cessed online 9; its main window is presented in
Figure 1.
“Raw data” are placed on the left-hand side of
the interface: definitions of the initial word and ex-
amples, possible synonyms for each of the mean-
ings in turn with definitions and examples. The
right-hand part represents resulted synsets includ-
ing words, definitions, and examples. In principle,
an editor can assemble a “minimal” synset from
the dictionary “raw material” simply with several
mouse clicks, without any typing.
Synset assembly begins with a word, or “synset
starter”. The editor selects an item from the list
of words ranked by decreasing frequency; already
processed words are shaded. The editor can go
through the words one after another or choose an
arbitrary word using search box.
The top left-hand pane displays definitions of
the initial word and usage examples if any. To sim-
plify the view, editor can turn out examples or to
blind individual definitions. Possible synonyms of
the initial word are listed at the bottom-left pane,
in turn with definitions and examples. The top-
right pane displays a list of synsets containing the
initial word. The editor can copy definitions and
usage examples of the initial word from the top left
of the interface to the current synset with mouse
clicks. From the synonyms pane one can transfer
bare words or words along with definitions and ex-
amples. The editor can add a new word to the list

definitions and examples of the initial word; 3) possible synonyms of the initial word with definitions
and examples; 4) a list of synsets containing the initial word (active synset is highlighted); 5) words con-

of synonyms; it will appear with dictionary defini-
tions and examples if presented in the parsed data.
If the editor is not satisfied with the collected def-
initions, they can create a new one — either from
scratch or based on one of the existing descrip-
tions. Additionally, a word or a definition within a
synset can be flagged as “main”; and be provided
with labels. All synset edits are tracked and stored
in the database along with timestamps and editor
ID.
YARN software is implemented using Ruby on
Rails framework. All data are stored in a Post-
greSQL database. User authentication is per-
formed through an OAuth endpoint provided by
Facebook. The user interface is implemented as
a browser JavaScript application. The applica-
tion interacts with the server application via JSON
API. The entire source code of the project is avail-
able in an open repository10.

5 Preliminary Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999876052631579">
In the fall 2013 we conducted a pilot user study
with 45 students of the linguistics department at
the Ural Federal University. The experiment re-
sulted in 1390 synsets; 970 of them are ‘non-
trivial’, i.e. contain more than a single word (253
contain 2 words, 228 — 3 words, 207 — 4, 282 —
5+). Editors spent about two minutes on building
a ‘non-trivial’ synset on average, which we find a
very good result. Figure 2 shows the distribution
of edit times for 2+ word synsets. Distribution of
completed synsets by students is also skewed, e.g.
top-5 contributors account for more than a third of
all non-trivial synsets (329).
Figure 3 shows a linear trend of time spent by
five top contributors on constructing consecutive
non-trivial synsets. Four out of five demonstrate
a learning effect: average time per synset tends to
decrease while the editor proceeds through tasks.
In general, students were very positive about

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999720894736842">
YARN synset assembly tool passed an initial test-
ing and proved to be a usable tool for creation of
thesaurus building blocks. Upon reading simple
instructions, volunteers were able to quickly learn
an intuitive interface and accomplish the synset as-
sembly task without problems.
During the experiment we were able to diag-
nose some flaws related to interface design, editor
guidelines, and internal data representation. In the
future we will elaborate instructions and learning
materials, clean existing and add more dictionary
data, and perform a thorough evaluation of the in-
terface. Then, we will work on an interface for
linking synsets and expand YARN with verbs and
adjectives.

As in the case of Wikipedia and Wiktionary, we foresee two levels of contributors: line editors and administrators with the corresponding privileges. According to our expectations, the total number of line editors can reach two hundreds throughout a year. 3 Raw Materials for YARN We used two sources of “raw materials” for YARN: 1) Russian Wiktionary and 2) Small Academic Dictionary (SAD). Russian Wiktionary dump as of March 2012 was parsed and converted to database format using Wikokit software (Krizhanovsky and Smirnov, 2013). Wiktionary dump contains 51,028 nouns, including 45,646 single-word nouns; 30,031 entries have at least one definition. Besides the words and definitions Wiktionary dump contains occasionally synonym references and word usage examples. SAD data contain 33,220 word entries and 51,676 definitions. All single-word nouns were provided with frequencies based on the Russian National Corpus8. 4 User Interface The current synset editing interface can be accessed online 9; its main window is presented in Figure 1. “Raw data” are placed on the left-hand side of the interface: definitions of the initia</context>

Crowdsourcing can employ both paid workers, e.g. on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform1 and volunteers as in case of Wiktionary2 — a large wiki-style online multilingual dictionary. The goal of the YARN (Yet Another RussNet) project3 launched in 2013 is to create a large open thesaurus for Russian language using crowdsourcing (Braslavski et al., 2013). Despite the fact that there were several attempts to create a Russian Wordnet (Azarova et al., 2002; Balkova et al., 2004; Gelfenbein et al., 2003; Loukachevitch and Dobrov, 2002), there is no open resource of acceptable quality and coverage currently available. The choice of crowdsourcing is also advocated by successful projects that are being evolved by volunteers: Russian Wiktionary4, corpus annotation project OpenCorpora5 and a wiki for linguistic resources related to Russian NLPub6. 1http://www.mturk.com/ 2http://www.wiktionary.org/ 3http://russianword.net/ 4http://ru.wiktionary.org/ 5http://opencorpora.org/ 6http://nlpub.ru/ Wordnets had been traditionally developed within small research teams. This approach maintains conceptual consistency and project manageabil</context>
