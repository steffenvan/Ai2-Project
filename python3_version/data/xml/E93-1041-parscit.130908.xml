Linguistic access to uncertain quantita-
tive knowledge about physical properties
is provided by dimensional adjectives,
e.g. long-short in the spatial and tempo-
ral senses, near-far, fast-slow, etc. Seman-
tic analyses of the dimensional adjectives
differ on whether the meaning of the dif-
ferential comparative (6 cm shorter than)
and the equative with factor term (three
times as long as) is a compositional func-
tion of the meanings the difference and fac-
tor terms (6 cm and three times) and the
meanings of the simple comparative and
equative, respectively. The compositional
treatment comes at the price of a meaning
representation that some authors ([Pinkal,
19901, [Klein, 1991]) find objectionally un-
parsimonious. In this paper, I compare
semantic approaches by investigating the
complexity of reasoning that they entail;
specifically, I show the complexity of con-
straint propagation over real-valued inter-
vals using the Waltz algorithm in a system
where the meaning representations of sen-
tences appear as constraints (cf. [Davis,
1987]). It turns out that the compositional
account is more complex on this measure.
However, I argue that we face a tradeoff
rather than a knock-down argument against
compositionality, since the increased com-
plexity of the compositional approach may
be manageable if certain assumptions about
the application domain can be made.

<bodyText confidence="0.999938545454546">
In the past decade, the field of knowledge represen-
tation (KR) has seen impressive growth of sophis-
tication in the representation of uncertain quantita-
tive knowledge about physical properties in common-
sense reasoning and qualitative physics. The input
to most of these systems is entered by hand, but
some of them, especially those with commonsense
domains involving spatial and temporal knowledge,
are amenable to interaction by means of a natural
language interface. Linguistic access to knowledge
about properties such as durations, rates of change,
distances, the sizes of the symmetry axes of objects,
and so on, is provided by dimensional adjectives
(e.g. long-short in the spatial and temporal senses,
fast-slow, near-far, tall-short). In this paper, I will
investigate two aspects of their semantics that have
an impact on the quality of a KR system with an NL
interface. One aspect is the complexity of reason-
ing entailed by their semantic interpretations. As an
example, suppose that we have a text about the in-
stallation of new kitchen appliances that contains the
following sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8271846">
(1) a. The refridgerator is about 60 cm wide.
b. The cupboard is about as deep as the
refridgerator is wide.
c. The kitchen table is about 5 cm longer
than the cupboard is deep.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9521725">
d. The oven is about twice as high as
the table is long.
We may view the relations expressed by these sen-
tences as constraints on the measurements of the ob-
ject axes (the width of the fridge, the depth of the
cupboard, and so on), which are represented as pa-
rameters in a constraint system. Then constraint
propagation, along with some knowledge about the

sizes that are typical for object categories, should
allow us to derive the following sentences (among
others) from (1):
(2) a. The cupboard is about 60 cm deep.
b. The kitchen table is longer than
the refridgerator is wide.
c. The kitchen table is short
(for a kitchen table).
d. The oven is about 70 cm higher than
the cupboard is deep.
e. The oven is high (for an oven).
The inferences from (1) to (2) are rather simple,
but reasoning can become very complicated if a large
number of parameters and constraints must be ac-
counted for. As we will see below, the computational
properties of this kind of reasoning are dependent on
the types of relations that appear in the knowledge
base. Thus in the present paper, I investigate the
kinds of relations that appear in formal theories of
the meanings of the following morphosyntactic con-
structions of dimensional adjectives:

The board is (three times) as long as
the table is wide.
d. Measurement
The board is 50 cm long.
This brings us to the second issue: the compo-
sitionality of meaning representations proposed for
the sentences in (3). It is appealing from the view-
point of theoretical linguistics to regard each of the
morphosyntactic categories (positive, etc.) as lexical
items with their own semantics, and to assume that
the semantics of each sentence in (3) is a composi-
tional function of the semantics of the morphosyntac-
tic category and the semantics of the adjective stem.
Compositional meaning representations may also be
computationally more advantageous, since they can
be computed very efficiently from syntactic represen-
tations (e.g. in unification-based formalisms).
Most formal theories of the meanings of adjectives
attempt to fulfill this criterion of compositionality,
but as we will see, they differ on a more far-reaching
criterion: whether the meaning of the differential
comparative (6 cm shorter than) and the equative
with factor term (three times as long as) is a compo-
sitional function of the meanings the difference and
factor terms (6 cm and three times) and the meanings
of the simple comparative and equative, respectively.
Although compositionality is generally regarded as a
virtue in and of itself, some authors aPinkal, 1990],
[Klein, 1991]) have objected to compositional treat-
ments of difference and factor terms on the grounds
that they introduce an excessive amount of mathe-
matical structure into our linguistic models.
In section 3, I will compare semantic representa-
tions that do and do not foresee a compositional
treatment of difference and factor terms by analyzing
the complexity of reasoning that they entail. In par-
ticular, I will investigate the complexity of constraint
propagation in a system where the meaning repre-
sentations appear as constraints. In this paradigm,
uncertain quantitative knowledge is accounted for
with real-valued intervals, a popular choice in KR
systems, and constraint propagation is performed by
the Waltz algorithm (which gets its name from
David Waltz [19751). Ernest Davis [1987] shows in
his detailed analysis that the Waltz algorithm is one
of the best choices for this task, for reasons that I
will explain in section 3.1
It turns out that the constraint propagation with
the Waltz algorithm under the compositional ap-
proach is more complex; thus, we apparently face
a tradeoff between compositionality and com-
plexity. I argue in section 4 that this is indeed
a tradeoff, since the non-compositional formation of
meaning representations may be expensive, and the
increased complexity of the compositional approach
may be manageable, especially if certain assumptions
can be made about the domain of physical properties
being represented.

<bodyText confidence="0.99986665">
There is a vast amount of linguistic data on which
a formal semantics of adjectives can be evaluated,
such as the interaction of comparative and equative
complements with scope-bearing operators: quanti-
fiers, logical connectives, modal operators and neg-
ative polarity items (e.g. John is taller than I will
ever be). A good theory must also account for the
phenomenon of markedness, i.e. the semantic asym-
metry of the antonyms (see [Lyons, 1977, Sect. 9.1]).
However, I will ignore these issues in order to focus
on the matter of compositionality. Thus I classify the
existing theories of adjective meaning very coarsely
as &apos;compositional&apos; or &apos;non-compositional&apos;. Note that
these labels indicate only whether or not the treat-
ment of difference and factor terms is compositional
(in other respects, all of the theories mentioned be-
low are compositional).
To begin with, I presuppose a component of di-
mensional designation that determines which prop-
erty of an object is described by an adjective, thus

but at the price of increased complexity. I comment on
this briefly in section 3.2.

determining that short conference describes a dura-
tion but short stick describes the length of the stick&apos;s
elongated axis. Each class of properties (duration,
length, etc.) is assumed to be associated with a set
of degrees reflecting their magnitudes. I will sim-
ply use the function expression amount(p(x)) to de-
note the degree to which entity x exhibits property
p. Each set of degrees is assumed to be ordered,
and I will use the symbols C and C for the ordering
relation. Most authors assume measurement theory
([Krantz et al., 1971]) as the axiomatic basis in the
formal semantics of linguistic measurement expres-
sions (cf. [Klein, 1991]). For measurement expres-
sions such as 3 cm, I simply use a tuple (3, cm) de-
noting a degree. Finally, I follow [Bierwisch, 1989]
in using the symbol IVc(a) for the &apos;norm&apos; expected
for amount a in context C. This reflects the usual
assumption that the positive expresses a relation to
a context-dependent standard. In this paper, I will
restrict my attention to norms that are typical for
the categories named in the sentence, such as tall for
an adult Dutchman, slow for a sports car, etc.2
The class of theories that I am referring to as &apos;non-
compositional&apos; include those of [Cresswell, 1976],
[Hoeksema, 1983] and [Pinkal, 1990], who propose
formulas similar to those in Table 1 as interpreta-
tions of the sentences in (3). The relation used in
place of the expression ID / C) is for the un-
marked case (e.g. tall) and C for the marked case
(short) .3
&apos;Clearly, there are many other kinds of norms. Jan
is tall may mean tall for his age, taller than I expected,
etc. [Sapir, 1944] is still one of the best surveys of the
norms employed in natural language, while Bierwisch has
a more modern analysis.
30f course, Tables 1 and 2 are strong simplifica-
I call this approach non-compositional because in-
terpretations of the differential comparative (6 cm
longer than) and of the equative with factor term
(three times as long as) are not derivable from the
formulas shown in lines (b) and (c) (the same can be
said of [Kamp, 1975] and [Klein, 1980]).
The compositional approach is taken by [Henan,
1981], [von Stechow, 1984] and [Bierwisch, 19891,
whose renderings of (3) are, in simplified form, some-
thing like those in Table 2. The symbol &apos;±&apos; is + in
the unmarked case and — in the marked case, and
&apos;x&apos; stands for scalar multiplication.4
In the case of the positive and the ordinary com-
parative, the difference term D is existentially quan-
tified, as is the factor term n in the case of the ordi-
nary equative (with the additional condition that n
is greater than or equal to one). But if the difference
or factor term is realized in the sentence surface, then
its contribution to (b) and (c) in Table 2 is embedded
compositionally.5
tions that fail to reflect important differences between
the authors mentioned that are unrelated to the issue of
compositionality.
4In measurement theory, the `+&apos; operation is inter-
preted as concatenation in the empirical domain, and
scalar multiplication is interpreted as repeated concate-
nation. Krantz et al. [1971] show that under proper ax-
iomatization, concatenation is homomorphic to addition
on the ma&apos;s.
5Bierwisch [1989] differs from the other authors ad-
vocating a compositional approach in that he does not
assume the interpretation of the equative shown in Ta-
ble 2. He points out (p. 85) that this analysis does not
account for the fact that the equative is norm-related in
the unmarked case: Fritz is as short as Hans presup-
poses that Fritz and Hans are short. Moreover, it is not
clear whether this approach can capture the duality of

<bodyText confidence="0.9999921">
For the computational analysis, we will need to
classify the relations shown in Tables 1 and 2, since
these relations form the input to a knowledge base.
But to do so, we must first decide what sorts of en-
tities the difference and factor terms denote. I as-
sume that they do not denote constants, since we
may be just as uncertain of their magnitudes as we
are of the other magnitudes mentioned in the sen-
tences. Thus it should be possible to treat each of
the mini-discourses in (4)-(6) in a similar fashion:
In both approaches, measurements simply serve to
identify the degree to which an object exhibits the
property in question.
Under the compositional approach, it is possible to
assume a single semantic representation in the lex-
icon for each adjective stem and each morphosyn-
tactic category such that the formulas in Table 2
are generated from those lexical entries. Bierwisch
[1989], for example, proposes lexical entries of the
following form for each dimensional adjective:
</bodyText>

AcAx[amount(p(x)) = (v ± c)]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999890333333333">
comparatives and equatives: Fritz is taller than Hans
should be semantically equivalent to Hans is not as tall
as Fritz. However, Bierwisch does assume a representa-
tion like this for equatives with realized factor terms.
where c is a difference value and v is a comparison
value (see [Bierwisch, 1989] for details).
But the elegance of the compositional approach
comes at the price of lexical semantic representations
that include addition and multiplication operators,
which is precisely what Pinkal [1990] and Klein [1991]
have criticized: they find the assumption of math-
ematical operations as basic constituents of lexical
meaning uncomfortably strong. This is one of the
reasons why Pinkal proposes separate lexical entries
for each morphosyntactic form of an adjective.

3 The Complexity of Constraint
Propagation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999605181818182">
The objection to the complexity of the lexical mean-
ing representations required for the compositional
approach appeals to intuitions of parsimony, and is
in part a matter of philosophical opinion that may
be difficult to resolve. Perhaps a decision could be
made on the basis of psycholinguistic experimenta-
tion, but I will pose a more utilitarian question in
this section by examining whether the increase in
representational complexity in the transition from
Table 1 to Table 2 entails an increase in the com-
putational complexity of reasoning for a knowledge
base containing those representations. The reasoning
paradigm to be investigated is constraint propaga-
tion (sometimes called constraint satisfaction) over
real-valued intervals.
Intervals are intended to account for uncertainty
in quantitative knowledge. For example, the mea-
surement of a parameter at 20 units on some scale
with a possible measurement error of ±0.5 units is
represented as [19.5, 20.51, to be interpreted as mean-
ing that the unknown measurement value in ques-
tion lies somewhere in the set {x119.5 &lt; x &lt; 20.5}.
Additional knowledge about the relations that hold
between parameters constrains their possible values
to smaller sets (hence the term &apos;constraints&apos; for the
propositions in a knowledge base expressing such re-
lations).
Constraint propagation over intervals has been ap-
plied in spatial reasoning ([McDermott and Davis,
1984; Davis, 1986; Brooks, 1981; Simmons, 1992]),
temporal reasoning (e.g. [Dean, 1987; Allen and
Kautz, 1985]) and in systems of qualitative physics
(see [Weld and deKleer, 1990; Bobrow, 1985]). In-
tervals have a very obvious weakness in that the
highly precise choice of endpoints can rarely be well-
motivated in natural domains such as these. In par-
ticular, the reasoner may draw very different infer-
ences, e.g. about whether two intervals overlap, if
the endpoint of some interval is changed by what
seems to be an insignificant amount. Thus, as Me.-
Dermott and Davis [1984] note, such a system must
not only be able to report whether they overlap, but
also &amp;quot;how close&amp;quot; they come to overlapping.
If they do come close ... , then ... [the

duced in (a). Hence, the difference and factor terms,

uncertain quantities whose magnitude may be con-
strained by sets of sentences. I will refer to these
terms generally as &apos;parameters&apos;.
With this assumption, we can classify the relations

suspect information or work to gather more,
which is really the only interesting decision
in a case like this. Eventually, when all
possible information has been gathered, if
things are still close to the borderline then a
decision maker must just use some arbitrary
criterion to make a decision. We don&apos;t see
how anyone can escape this. [McDermott

A formalism such as fuzzy logic attempts to al-
leviate the problem of sharp borderlines by using
infinitely many intermediate truth values for vague
predicates. I happen to have reservations about the
adequacy of fuzzy logic for this task&apos;, but I have cho-
sen to study constraint propagation mainly because
its computational properties are well-researched and
are attractive for applications in which the potential
overprecision of endpoints can be tolerated. Thus it
provides a sound basis for comparing the semantic
analyses presented in section 2.

3.2 Constraint Propagation Algorithms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996145666666667">
The task of a constraint propagation algorithm
(CPA) is to tighten the interval labels in an attempt
to either (1) find a labelling that is just tight enough
to be consistent with the constraints and initial la-
belling, or (2) signal inconsistency. Constraint prop-
agation separates a stage of assimilation, during
which intervals are tightened, from querying, dur-
ing which the tightened values are reported. It is
also possible to infer previously unknown relations
between the parameters in the querying stage by in-
specting the tightened intervals. This method of rea-
soning may be applied in the linguistic application
under study, for example to derive the sentences in
(2) above from (1).
A CPA is sound if v(con • • • n v(c,,)n v(Lo c
V(L) for every labelling L returned by the algorithm,
where {C1, , Cm} is the set of constraints in the
system and L1 is the initial labelling. It is complete
if V(L) C V(C1) n • • • n v(co n v(LI) for every
L that it returns. In other words, the algorithm is
sound if it does not eliminate any values that are
consistent with the starting state of the system, and
complete if it returns only such values.
As we will see, CPA&apos;s for intervals can only be
complete under very restricted circumstances. Thus
Davis defines a weaker form of completeness for the
assimilation process. A CPA is complete for as-
similation if every labelling L that it returns as-
signs labels Xi =[x,xi,+] such that if I4(X1) E
D([xL zi+i), then V, E V(Ci) n • • • n V(C,,). That
is, the label assigned to each parameter accurately
reflects the range of values it may attain given the
constraints in the system.
The Waltz algorithm, which is stated below, is su-
perior to many other CPA&apos;s in these respects. It is
a sound algorithm, unlike the Monte Carlo method
used by [Davis, 1986] and the hill-climber used by
[McDermott and Davis, 1984]. Moreover, for con-
straint systems containing restricted types of con-
straints, the Waltz algorithm is complete for assim-
ilation and terminates very quickly. In contrast,
Davis reports that the hill-climbers used by [McDer-
mott and Davis, 1984] were prohibitively slow and
unreliable.
The algorithm is based on an operation called re-
finement, defined as follows. Given a constraint C1,

by replacing xi in L with the lower bound of
REF IN E(Ci, X, L), and R+ (Xi, COM is formed
by replacing xi+ in L with the upper bound of
REFINE(Ci, Xi, L). We say that these refinements
are based on Cj. If the upper and lower bounds
of REFINE are computable, then refinement is by
definition a sound operation.
For a constraint system C = (X, {C1, • • • , Cn}
L is quiescent for a set of refinement operators R =
{Ri, , Rn} if Ri(L) = • • • = Rn(L) = L. The
solution to C (if it exists) is the labelling L&apos; denoting
the largest set of valuations V(V) C V(L)n v(C1) n
• • n V(C0) such that L&apos; is quiescent for any set of
refinements based on the constraints in the system.
If no such solution exists, then C is inconsistent.
The Waltz algorithm repeatedly executes refine-
ments until the system is quiescent, and returns the
solution (or signals inconsistency) if it terminates (cf.
[Davis, 1987, p. 2861).

Since refinement is a sound operation, the Waltz
algorithm is sound. The completeness, termination
and time complexity of the algorithm depends on
what kinds of relations appear as constraints in the
system, and on the order in which constraints are
taken off the queue. The results for systems consist-
ing exclusively of one of the three kinds of relations
mentioned in (7)-(8) in section 2 are given in Table
3, under the assumption that constraints are selected
in FIFO order or a fixed sequential order (other or-
derings lead to worse results). Time complexity is
measured as the number of iterations through the
main loop of the algorithm. For comparison, Table
3 also gives the best known times for complete solu-
tions to systems of such relations.8
In the linguistic application proposed here, the
term S in Table 3 (the sum of the lengths of all of
the constraints) is proportional to c (the number of
constraints), since there are no more than three pa-
rameters in each constraint. Hence, 0(pS) is 0(pc)
in this application.
Note that Table 3 gives results for linear inequali-
ties with unit coefficients (of the form p &lt; &gt; xi -
E. x• &lt; q where no coefficients differ from 1 or
1
—1). These are the only kind of linear inequalities
under consideration in the linguistic application. In
general, the Waltz algorithm breaks down if the sys-
tem contains more complex relations, such as linear
inequalities with arbitrary coefficients or product re-
lations, since it may go into infinite loops even if the
starting state of the system was consistent. Con-
sider, for example, the set of constraints {n1 x X =
Y, n2 x X = Y} with the starting labels n1 = [1,1],
n2 :-L- [2,2], X = [0,100] and Y = [0,100]. The sys-
tem continually bisects the upper bounds of X and Y
without ever being able to reach the solution, which
8HyvOnen&apos;s [Hyvanen, 1992] tolerance propagation
(TP) approach is similar to the Waltz algorithm, but
it uses a queue of solution functions from interval arith-
metic [Alefeld and Herzberger, 1983] rather than refine-
ment operations. The &amp;quot;global TP&amp;quot; method computes
complete solutions, but at the price of increased com-
plexity. In the &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; mode, tolerance propagation is
very similar to the Waltz algorithm in its computational
properties.

labels are X [1, oo] and Y [1, co], then the the
lower bounds are continually doubled without reach-
ing the solution X [oo , oo] and Y [oo, co].
However, it is shown in [Simmons, 1993] that this
happens only if the solution contains labels of this
kind. Define a label as admissible if it is not equal
to [0, 0] or [oo, oo]; otherwise, it is inadmissible. A
labelling L is admissible if it only assigns admissible
labels; otherwise, L is inadmissible. Then it can be
shown that if a system of product constraints is con-
sistent and its solution is admissible, then the Waltz
algorithm terminates in 0(pS) time. Moreover, if
the system is inconsistent, the algorithm will find
the inconsistency in finite but arbitrarily long time.
Unfortunately, the proof is too long to include in the
present paper, but a brief outline of the argument is
given in the Appendix.
Systems with linear inequalities or product con-
straints are liable to enter infinite or very long loops
if the starting state is inconsistent (or if the solution
is inadmissible in the case of products). Davis [1987,
p. 305-306] suggests a strong heuristic for detecting
and terminating such long loops: stop if we have been
through the queue p times (for p parameters). He is
not clear on what he means by &amp;quot;having been through
the queue x times&amp;quot;, but I interpret him as meaning
that we should stop if any constraint has been taken
off the queue more often than p times. The rationale
is the observation that in practice, most systems that
do terminate normally seem to do so before this con-
dition is fulfilled, much sooner than the worst-case
time predicted by the complexity analysis. The reli-
ability of such a heuristic is one of the topics of the
next subsection.

3.3 Empirical Testing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999575">
The analytic results given in the previous subsection
have left two important questions open:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9898414">
• What is the complexity of constraint propaga-
tion if the system contains different kinds of con-
straints?
• How reliable is Davis&apos; heuristic for terminating
infinite (or very long) loops?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974782608696">
The first question lends itself to an analytic an-
swer, but the results are not known at present. But
we can seek empirical evidence by running the al-
gorithm on mixed systems of constraints to see if
the time to termination is significantly greater than
the complexity expected for systems containing just
the most complex type of relation in the system. If
this does not happen for a number of representa-
tive systems, we may conjecture that the combina-
tion of constraints has not made the problem more
complex. The second question can only be answered
empirically, by testing whether the heuristic tends
to terminate the algorithm too soon (i.e. whether
it terminates refinement of systems that might have
terminated normally in a short time).
Empirical investigations of these questions are re-
ported in [Simmons, 1993], and described briefly
here. To investigate the first question, the algorithm
was run on a number of large, consistent constraint
systems with admissible solutions in which the three
types of constraints shown in Table 3 appeared in
approximately equal numbers. On each run, the con-
straints in the initial queue were permuted randomly
to suppress the possible effects of ordering. None of
these runs required more time to termination than
is predicted by the 0(pS) result for systems con-
taining just unit linear inequalities or just product
constraints.
To investigate the second question, I attempted
to build consistent constraint systems with admissi-
ble solutions that are terminated by Davis&apos; heuris-
tic sooner than they would have been normally. It
turns out that the algorithm runs to completion on
almost all systems that were tested long before any
constraint is taken off the queue p times, although
there are systems for which refinement is terminated
too soon on this heuristic. If the limit is increased
by a constant factor, e.g. if assimilation is stopped
after some constraint is processed 2p times, then the
risk of early termination is greatly reduced.
In all, the empirical results on the open questions
mentioned above have been encouraging. It is an
admitted weakness of these tests, however, that they
were performed on systems built by hand, not on
constraint systems that occur &amp;quot;naturally&amp;quot; as part of
an NL interface to a KR, system.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999779769230769">
The results of the previous section yield Tables 4
and 5 as the complexity of reasoning with the Waltz
algorithm under the non-compositional and compo-
sitional approaches, respectively. These results de-
pend in part on the fact that there is a maximum
number of parameters in each constraint in the lin-
guistic application. Measurements are modelled as
predicate constraints, i.e. they simply impose inter-
val bounds on some parameter. Intervals are also
assumed to model the range of measurement values
for the physical property that is typical for members
of a category (e.g. the typical width of refridgera-
tors), thus accounting for the norm used in the in-
terpretation of positives. An important property of
such &amp;quot;norm intervals&amp;quot; is that they may not be re-
fined, at least not too much. This may be achieved
by adding constraints imposing absolute upper and
lower bounds on their ranges (cf. [Simmons, 1992]).
Although the worst-case time complexity in all
cases turns out to be the same, the compositional
approach is more complex for two reasons. First,
the system is prone to enter infinite loops under the
compositional approach if the starting state is incon-
sistent, or if the solution is inadmissible. Consistency
cannot generally be guaranteed in the linguistic ap-
plication under consideration, since the sentences in

a text may contain errors. Second, reasoning under
the compositional approach is incomplete in all but
the trivial case of measurements, whereas the non-
compositional approach guarantees at least assimi-
lation completeness for a subset of the parameters
in the system. This means that under the compo-
sitional approach, the reasoner does not refine some
intervals as tightly as it could have under the non-
compositional approach.
These results may be taken as grounds for reject-
ing the compositional approach to the semantics of
dimensional adjectives in the design of an NL in-
terface to a KR system for quantitative knowledge.
However, I do not believe that the compositional ap-
proach is contraindicated for all conceivable systems.
In addition to the general theoretical appeal of com-
positional semantics, the compositional formation
of meaning representations may be computationally
more attractive in some cases (e.g. in unification-
based formalisms). Thus if the non-compositional
formation of semantic representations turns out to
be too expensive, it may defeat the computational
advantage gained in the reasoning process.
This is especially true if the weaknesses of the com-
positional approach do not turn out to be highly
relevant in the specific application. For example, if
the domain of physical properties being represented
is such that a set of constraints requiring some pa-
rameter to be set to [0,0] or [oo, oo] is unlikely to
be encountered, and hence the solution is likely to
be admissible, then the risk of infinite loops is re-
duced. Moreover, if Davis&apos; heuristic for terminating
infinite loops turns out to be reliable (which might
be determinable by experimentation within the spe-
cific application), then inconsistencies need not be
very damaging.
The incompleteness of reasoning under the com-
positional approach is unacceptable for an applica-
tion if it is crucial that the inferred intervals con-
tain precisely those values that are warranted by the
constraints and the initial labelling. If a superset of
those values can be accepted, however, then the com-
positional approach can be taken. Both approaches
suffer a lack of what Davis calls query complete-
ness: if the value of a term T is to be determined
during the querying stage (i.e. after assimilation),
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996646">
355

<bodyText confidence="0.989246461538462">
the system may return a superset of the values for T
that are warranted by the constraints.
Thus an engineer building an NL interface to a
system for reasoning about uncertain quantitative
knowledge of physical properties must make a num-
ber of design decisions:
• How important are difference and factor terms
in the linguistic material to be processed?
If difference and factor terms are so marginal
that they may not occur at all, then the non-
compositional approach is probably the better
choice, due to its guarantee of termination and as-
similation completeness.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.526692666666667">
• Does the compositional generation of lexical se-
mantic representations have a significant advan-
tage (computational or otherwise) over the non-
compositional approach?
• Is it possible or likely for the measurement of
some physical property to be exactly zero?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991904782608696">
While there is probably no natural application in
which the magnitude of some property can be in-
finitely large, there are different philosophies about
the treatment of zero. In a system of temporal rea-
soning, for example, saying that some event has zero
duration may be a way of saying that the event does
not exist. But another policy might be to insist that
no physical property is represented if it is not exhib-
ited to a positive degree. If this assumption can be
made, then the intervals [0, 0] and [co, oo] are truly
inadmissible, and hence one weakness of the compo-
sitional approach is diminished.
• Is it important that the precise range of permis-
sible measurement values be inferred for each
parameter, or can a superset of those values be
useful?
If a superset of the possible values is acceptable, then
the compositional approach can be chosen. Other-
wise, the non-compositional approach must be taken.
By weighing the various answers to these ques-
tions, an engineer can stake out a position on the
tradeoff and design a system with the power and ef-
ficiency most appropriate to his or her needs.

Appendix
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997654485714286">
In the following, the proof of the following theorem
(from [Simmons, 1993]) is briefly outlined:
Theorem 1 If a system of product constraints is
consistent and its solution is admissible, then the
Waltz algorithm brings it to quiesence in time 0(pS).
Recall that a product constraint is of the form
HiX1 = Y, and that a labelling is admissible if it
does not assign [0,0] or [oo, oo] to any parameter.
First we need some terminology defined in [Davis,
1987, Appendix 13] (recall the definition of refine-
ment operators in section 3.2 above).
For a refinement operator R, let OUT(R) be the
bound affected by R, and let ARGS(R) be the set
of bounds other than OUT(R) that enter into the
computation of OUT(R). Given a labelling L, R is
active on L if it changes L, i.e. if L R(L).
A series of refinement operators R. = (R1, • • • , RIO
is active if each refinement in R. is active. We say
that Ri is an immediate predecessor of Rj in R.
if i &lt;j, OUT(Ri) E ARGS(Rj), and for all k such
that i &lt; k &lt; j, OUT(Rk) OUT(Ri). In other
words, some argument of Ri has been set most re-
cently in the series by Rj. We say that Ri depends
on Rj if either i = j or Ri depends on Rk and Rj
is an immediate predecessor of R. Thus the depen-
dence relation is the transitive and reflexive closure
of the immediate precedence relation. We say that
Ri depends on bound B if for some Rj, Ri depends
on Rj and B E ARGS(Rj).
The series of refinements R. = (R1, . . , 110 is self-
dependent if R depends on OUT(R), its own out-
put bound. In other words, a series is self-dependent
if the last bound affected by the series is also an argu-
ment to the first refinement in a chain of refinements
in the precedence relation, as illustrated below.

Theorem 2 Any infinite sequence of active refine-
ments contains an active, self-dependent subsequence
((Davis, 1987, Lemma B.15B.
In [Simmons, 1993], it is shown that if any self-
dependent sequence R is active on the labelling of a
system of product constraints, then a certain sub-
sequence 12! of 7Z will be active infinitely many
times. Moreover, on the m-th execution of each re-
finement Ri in &apos;12! , there is a term Tr , where each
&gt; Tr-1 &gt; 1, such that OUT(Ri) is multiplied
by:
(Tr )-1, if OUT(Ri) is an upper bound
7, if OUT(Ri) is a lower bound
It follows that upper bounds are refined so as to
become arbitrarily small (asymptotically approach-
ing zero), and that lower bounds become arbitrarily
large, up to infinity.
Thus if there is any constraint Ci in the system
that imposes a lowest value greater than zero on an
P0-

upper bound that is affected by a refinement oper-
ator in V, that bound will be refined often enough
until it becomes inconsistent with C1. Similarly, if
any constraint C. imposes a largest finite value on
a lower bound that is affected by a refinement in
R.&apos;, then that bound will be refined until it becomes
inconsistent with Cu. In both cases, the system is
inconsistent.
If there are no such constraints, then it is consis-
tent for upper bounds affected by 1&apos; to be asymp-
totically close to zero and for lower bounds affected
by /&amp;quot;Z&apos; to be arbitrarily large. This can only be con-
sistent if, in the case of upper bounds, the solution
assigns [0, 0] to the parameter in question, and in the
case of lower bounds, the solution assigns [oo, cc] to
its parameter. Hence, the solution is inadmissible.
But according to Davis&apos; result (Theorem 2), in-
finite loops must contain an active, self-dependent
subsequence such as 1:4. It follows that if a system
of product constraints is consistent and its solution
is admissible, then the Waltz algorithm finds its so-
lution in finite time. The time complexity result is a
straightforward extension of Davis&apos; analysis of unit
linear inequalities (see [Simmons, 1993]).
