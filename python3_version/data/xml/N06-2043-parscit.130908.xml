Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99982125">
A study was conducted to explore the poten-
tial of Natural Language Processing (NLP)-
based knowledge discovery approaches for
the task of representing and exploiting the
vital information contained in field service
(trouble) tickets for a large utility provider.
Analysis of a subset of tickets, guided by
sublanguage theory, identified linguistic pat-
terns, which were translated into rule-based
algorithms for automatic identification of
tickets’ discourse structure. The subsequent
data mining experiments showed promising
results, suggesting that sublanguage is an ef-
fective framework for the task of discovering
the historical and predictive value of trouble
ticket data.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999948890909091">
Corporate information systems that manage cus-
tomer reports of problems with products or ser-
vices have become common nowadays. Yet, the
vast amount of data accumulated by these systems
remains underutilized for the purposes of gaining
proactive, adaptive insights into companies’ busi-
ness operations.
Unsurprising, then, is an increased interest by
organizations in knowledge mining approaches to
master this information for quality assurance or
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) pur-
poses. Recent commercial developments include
pattern-based extraction of important entities and
relationships in the automotive domain (Attensity,
2003) and text mining applications in the aviation
domain (Provalis, 2005).
This paper describes an exploratory feasibility
study conducted for a large utility provider. The
company was interested in knowledge discovery
approaches applicable to the data aggregated by its
Emergency Control System (ECS) in the form of
field service tickets. When a “problem” in the
company’s electric, gas or steam distribution sys-
tem is reported to the corporate Call Center, a new
ticket is created. A typical ticket contains the
original report of the problem and steps taken to
fix it. An operator also assigns a ticket an Original
Trouble Type, which can be changed later, as addi-
tional information clarifies the nature of the prob-
lem. The last Trouble Type assigned to a ticket
becomes its Actual Trouble Type.
Each ticket combines structured and unstruc-
tured data. The structured portion comes from sev-
eral internal corporate information systems. The
unstructured portion is entered by the operator who
receives information over the phone from a person
reporting a problem or a field worker fixing it. This
free text constitutes the main material for the
analysis, currently limited to known-item search
using keywords and a few patterns. The company
management grew dissatisfied with such an ap-
proach as time-consuming and, likely, missing out
on emergent threats and opportunities or discover-
ing them too late. Furthermore, this approach lacks
the ability to knit facts together across trouble
tickets, except for grouping them by date or gross
attributes, such as Trouble Types. The company
management felt the need for a system, which,
based on the semantic analysis of ticket texts,
would not only identify items of interest at a more
granular level, such as events, people, locations,
dates, relationships, etc., but would also enable the
discovery of unanticipated associations and trends.
The feasibility study aimed to determine
whether NLP-based approaches could deal with

such homely, ungrammatical texts and then to ex-
plore various knowledge mining techniques that
would meet the client’s needs. Initial analysis of a
sample of data suggested that the goal could be
effectively accomplished by looking at the data
from the perspective of sublanguage theory.
The novelty of our work is in combining sym-
bolic NLP and statistical approaches, guided by
sublanguage theory, which results in an effective
methodology and solution for such data.
This paper describes analyses and experiments
conducted and discusses the potential of the sub-
language approach for the task of tapping into the
value of trouble ticket data.

Sublanguage theory posits that texts produced
within a certain discourse community exhibit
shared, often unconventional, vocabulary and
grammar (Grishman and Kittredge, 1986; Harris,
1991). Sublanguage theory has been successfully
applied in biomedicine (Friedman et al., 2002;
Liddy et al., 1993), software development (Etzkorn
et al., 1999), weather forecasting (Somers, 2003),
and other domains. Trouble tickets exhibit a spe-
cial discourse structure, combining system-
generated, structured data and free-text sections; a
special lexicon, full of acronyms, abbreviations
and symbols; and consistent “bending” of grammar
rules in favor of speed writing (Johnson, 1992;
Marlow, 2004). Our work has also been informed
by the research on machine classification tech-
niques (Joachims, 2002; Yilmazel et al., 2005).

3 Development of the sublanguage model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999455309523809">
The client provided us with a dataset of 162,105
trouble tickets dating from 1995 to 2005. An im-
portant part of data preprocessing included token-
izing text strings. The tokenizer was adapted to fit
the special features of the trouble tickets’ vocabu-
lary and grammar: odd punctuation; name variants;
domain-specific terms, phrases, and abbreviations.
Development of a sublanguage model began
with manual annotation and analysis of a sample of
73 tickets, supplemented with n-gram analysis and
contextual mining for particular terms and phrases.
The analysis aimed to identify consistent linguistic
patterns: domain-specific vocabulary (abbrevia-
tions, special terms); major ticket sections; and
semantic components (people, organizations, loca-
tions, events, important concepts).
The analysis resulted in compiling the core do-
main lexicon, which includes acronyms for Trou-
ble Types (SMH - smoking manhole); departments
(EDS - Electric Distribution); locations (S/S/C -
South of the South Curb); special terms (PACM -
Possible Asbestos Containing Material); abbrevia-
tions (BSMNT - basement, F/UP - follow up); and
fixed phrases (NO LIGHTS, WHITE HAT). Origi-
nally, the lexicon was intended to support the de-
velopment of the sublanguage grammar, but, since
no such lexicon existed in the company, it can now
enhance the corporate knowledge base.
Review of the data revealed a consistent struc-
ture for trouble ticket discourse. A typical ticket
(Fig.1) consists of several text blocks ending with
an operator’s ID (12345 or JS). A ticket usually
opens with a complaint (lines 001-002) that pro-
vides the original account of a problem and often
contains: reporting entity (CONST MGMT), time-
stamp, short problem description, location. Field
work (lines 009-010) normally includes the name
of the assigned employee, new information about
the problem, steps needed or taken, complications,
etc. Lexical choices are limited and section-
specific; for instance, reporting a problem typically
opens with REPORTS, CLAIMS, or CALLED.

<bodyText confidence="0.999991214285714">
The analysis became the basis for developing
logical rules for automatic identification of ticket
sections and selected semantic components.
Evaluation of system performance on 70 manually
annotated and 80 unseen tickets demonstrated high
accuracy in automatic section identification, with
an error rate of only 1.4%, and no significant dif-
ference between results on the annotated vs. un-
seen tickets. Next, the automatic annotator was run
on the entire corpus of 162,105 tickets. The anno-
tated dataset was used in further experiments.
Identification of semantic components brings
together variations in names and spellings under a
single “normalized” term, thus streamlining and
expanding coverage of subsequent data analysis.
For example, strings UNSAFE LADDER, HAZ,
(hazard) and PACM (Possible Asbestos Containing
Material) are tagged and, thus, can be retrieved as
hazard indicators. “Normalization” is also applied
to name variants for streets and departments.
The primary value of the annotation is in effec-
tive extraction of structured information from these
unstructured free texts. Such information can next
be fed into a database and integrated with other
data attributes for further analysis. This will sig-
nificantly expand the range and the coverage of
data analysis techniques, currently employed by
the company.
The high accuracy in automatic identification of
ticket sections and semantic components can, to a
significant extent, be explained by the relatively
limited number and high consistency of the identi-
fied linguistic constructions, which enabled their
successful translation into a set of logical rules.
This also supported our initial view of the ticket
texts as exhibiting sublanguage characteristics,
such as: distinct shared common vocabulary and
constructions; extensive use of special symbols and
abbreviations; and consistent bending of grammar
in favor of shorthand. The sublanguage approach
thus enables the system to recognize effectively a
number of implicit semantic relationships in texts.

When several reports relate to the same or recur-

Each of these related tickets usually contains
some aspects of the trouble (Figure 3), but current
analytic approaches never brought them together to
create a complete picture of the problem, which
may provide for useful associations. Semantic
component related-ticket is expressed through pre-
dictable linguistic patterns that can be used as lin-
guistic clues for automatic grouping of related
tickets for further analysis.

remained out-of-scope for any analysis of associa-
tions between Trouble Types and semantic compo-
nents that would reveal trends. A number of
reasons may account for this, including uniqueness
of a problem or human error. Review of a sample
of MSE tickets showed that some of them should
have a more specific Trouble Type. For example
(Figure 4), both tickets, each initially assigned the
MSE type, describe the WL problem, but only one
ticket later receives this code.

Results of n-gram analyses (Liddy et al., 2006),
supported our hypothesis that different Trouble
Types have distinct linguistic features. Next, we
investigated if knowledge of these type-dependent
linguistic patterns can help with assigning specific
Types to MSE tickets. The task was conceptualized
as a multi-label classification, where the system is
trained on complaint sections of tickets belonging
to specific Trouble Types and then tested on tickets
belonging either to these Types or to the MSE
Type. Experiments were run using the Extended
LibSVM tool (Chang and Lin, 2001), modified for
another project of ours (Yilmazel et al., 2005).
Promising results of classification experiments,
with precision and recall for known Trouble Types
exceeding 95% (Liddy et al., 2006), can, to some
extent, be attributed to the fairly stable and distinct
language – a sublanguage – of the trouble tickets.

<bodyText confidence="0.999350666666667">
Initial exploration of the Trouble Tickets revealed
their strong sublanguage characteristics, such as:
wide use of domain-specific terminology, abbre-
viations and phrases; odd grammar rules favoring
shorthand; and special discourse structure reflec-
tive of the communicative purpose of the tickets.
The identified linguistic patterns are sufficiently
consistent across the data, so that they can be de-
scribed algorithmically to support effective auto-
mated identification of ticket sections and semantic
components.
Experimentation with classification algorithms
shows that applying the sublanguage theoretical
framework to the task of mining trouble ticket data
appears to be a promising approach to the problem
of reducing human error and, thus, expanding the
scope of data amenable to data mining techniques
that use Trouble Type information.
Our directions for future research include ex-
perimenting with other machine learning tech-
niques, utilizing the newly-gained knowledge of
the tickets’ sublanguage grammar, as well as test-
ing sublanguage analysis technology on other types
of field service reports.

This paper describes analyses and experiments conducted and discusses the potential of the sublanguage approach for the task of tapping into the value of trouble ticket data. 2 Related Research Sublanguage theory posits that texts produced within a certain discourse community exhibit shared, often unconventional, vocabulary and grammar (Grishman and Kittredge, 1986; Harris, 1991). Sublanguage theory has been successfully applied in biomedicine (Friedman et al., 2002; Liddy et al., 1993), software development (Etzkorn et al., 1999), weather forecasting (Somers, 2003), and other domains. Trouble tickets exhibit a special discourse structure, combining systemgenerated, structured data and free-text sections; a special lexicon, full of acronyms, abbreviations and symbols; and consistent “bending” of grammar rules in favor of speed writing (Johnson, 1992; Marlow, 2004).

Review of a sample of MSE tickets showed that some of them should have a more specific Trouble Type. For example (Figure 4), both tickets, each initially assigned the MSE type, describe the WL problem, but only one ticket later receives this code. Ticket 1 Original Code=&amp;quot;MSE&amp;quot; Actual Code=&amp;quot;WL&amp;quot; WATER LEAKING INTO TRANSFORMER BOX IN BASEMENT OF DORM; ...

Complaint sections, WL-problem Results of n-gram analyses (Liddy et al., 2006), supported our hypothesis that different Trouble Types have distinct linguistic features. Next, we investigated if knowledge of these type-dependent linguistic patterns can help with assigning specific Types to MSE tickets. The task was conceptualized as a multi-label classification, where the system is trained on complaint sections of tickets belonging to specific Trouble Types and then tested on tickets belonging either to these Types or to the MSE Type. Experiments were run using the Extended LibSVM tool (Chang and Lin, 2001), modified for another project of ours (Yilmazel et al., 2005). P</context>

Promising results of classification experiments, with precision and recall for known Trouble Types exceeding 95% (Liddy et al., 2006), can, to some extent, be attributed to the fairly stable and distinct language – a sublanguage – of the trouble tickets. 5 Conclusion and Future Work Initial exploration of the Trouble Tickets revealed their strong sublanguage characteristics, such as: wide use of domain-specific terminology, abbreviations and phrases; odd grammar rules favoring shorthand; and special discourse structure reflective of the communicative purpose of the tickets.
