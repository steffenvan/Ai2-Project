Carl Engelman Memorial Fund
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999818321428571">
Carl Engelman, one of the pioneers in artificial intelli-
gence research, died of a heart attack at his home in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, on November 26, 1983.
He was the creator of MATHLAB, a program devel-
oped in the 1960s for the symbolic manipulation of
mathematical expressions. His objective there was to
supply the scientist with an interactive computational
aid of a &amp;quot;more intimate and liberating nature&amp;quot; than
anything available before. Many of the ideas generat-
ed in the development of MATHLAB have influenced
the architecture of other systems for symbolic and
algebraic manipulation.
Carl graduated from the City College of New York
and then earned an MS Degree in Mathematics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During most
of his professional career, he worked at The MITRE
Corporation in Bedford, Massachusetts. In 1973 he
was on leave as a visiting professor at the Institute of
Information Science of the University of Turin, under
a grant from the Italian National Research Council.
At the time of his death, Carl was an Associate
Department Head at MITRE, responsible for a number
of research projects in artificial intelligence. His best
known recent work was KNOBS, a knowledge-based
system for interactive planning that was one of the
first expert systems applied productively to military
problems. Originally developed for the Air Force,
KNOBS was then adapted for a Navy system and is
currently being used in two NASA applications. Other
activities under his direction included research on nat-
ural language understanding and automatic program-
ming
Carl published a number of papers in journals and
books and gave presentations at many conferences.
But he also illuminated every meeting he attended with
his incisive analysis and his keen wit. While he will be
remembered for his contributions to artificial intelli-
gence, those who knew him personally will deeply miss
his warmth and humor, which he generously shared
with so many of us. Carl was particularly helpful to
people who had professional problems or faced career
choices; his paternal support, personal sponsorship,
and private intervention made significant differences
for many of his colleagues.
Carl was a member of the American Association
for Artificial Intelligence, the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Mathe-
matical Society, the Association for Computational
Linguistics, and the Association for Computing Ma-
chinery and its Special Interest Group on Artificial
Intelligence.
Contributions to the &amp;quot;Carl Engelman Memorial
Fund&amp;quot; should be sent to Judy Clapp at The MITRE
Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730. A deci-
sion will be made later on how those funds will be
used.

Call for Papers — Workshop on Transportable
Natural Language Processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956926392857143">
The Computer Science Department of Duke Universi-
ty, in cooperation with the Association for Computa-
tional Linguistics, is organizing a Workshop on Trans-
portable Natural Language Processing, to be held Oc-
tober 22-23, 1984. Funding is being provided by the
National Science Foundation, and the workshop will
include both invited and contributed presentations.
The focus will be on problems, both theoretical and
implementational, that arise when one seeks to adapt
an existing natural language processor for a new appli-
cation, for example, to operate with new types of data.
An edited collection of papers based on workshop
presentations will appear either in book form or as one
or more special journal sections. Persons wishing to
participate should send 3 copies of a 5-page summary
for a talk, or a 2-page position statement for a panel
session, to be received no later than July 31 to
Dr. Bruce Ballard
Dept. of Computer Science
Duke University
Durham, N.C. 27705
All submissions will be read by at least two invited
participants, and contributors will be notified as to
acceptance by September 7. Further information may
be obtained by writing to the address above, by calling
(919) 684-3048, or by sending mail on csnet to

Now that text editors, formatters, and rudimentary
spelling correction facilities have become available for
large and small computing environments, users are
beginning to want more natural means of creating,
reviewing, and improving various kinds of documents
and similar text files. This session focuses on techni-
ques that enable computer systems to recognize the
syntactic structure and understand at least some of the
meaning of English texts. Its purpose is to communi-
cate recent developments in applied natural language
processing where English acts as the object of atten-
tion. The companion session (see above) considers
systems where English acts as an interface to software
services.
