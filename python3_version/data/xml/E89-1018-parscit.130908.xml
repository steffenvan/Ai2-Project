We present a proposal for the structuring
of collocation knowledge 1 in the lexicon of
a multilingual generation system and show
to what extent it can be used in the pro-
cess of lexical selection. This proposal is
part of Polygloss, a new research project
on multilingual generation, and it has been
inspired by work carried out in the SEM-
SYN project (see e.g. [RoSNER 1988]2).
The descriptive approach presented in this
proposal is based on a combination of re-
sults from recent lexicographical research
and the application of Meaning-Text-Theory
(MTT) (see e.g. [MEL&apos; UK et al. 1981],
[MELtUK et al. 1984]). We first outline the
overall structure of the dictionary system that
is needed by a multilingual generator; section 2
gives an overview of the results of lexicograph-
ical work on collocations and compares them
with &amp;quot;lexical functions&amp;quot; as used in Meaning-
Text-Theory. Section 3 shows how we intend
to integrate collocations in the generation clic-
&apos;We use the term &amp;quot;collocation&amp;quot; in the sense of
[HAUSMANN 1985] referring to constraints on the
cooccurrence of two lexeme words; the two elements
are not completely freely combined, but one of them
semantically determines the other one. Examples are
for instance solve a problem, turn dark, expose someone
to a risk, etc. For a more detailed definition see section
2.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99953984">
The tradition of British Contextualism5 de-
fines collocations on the basis of statistical as-
sumptions about the probability of the cooc-
curence of two lexemes. Particularly frequent
combinations of lexical units are regarded as
collocations.
A more detailed definition can be found in
the work of Franz Josef Hausmann (1985:119):
&amp;quot;One partner determines, another is
determined. In other words: colloca-
tions have a basis and a cooccurring
collocate.&amp;quot;6
This determination manifests itself in so
far as a given basis does not allow all of the
collocates that would be possible according to
general semantic coocurrence conditions, but
only a certain subset: so in French, retenir son
admiration, retenir sa haine, sa joie are possi-
ble, but *retenir son desespoir is not.
The choice of collocates depends strongly
on the lexeme that has been chosen as the ba-
sis; knowledge about possible collocations can
be only partly derived -crom knowledge about
general semantic properties of lexemes. There-
fore general cooccurrence rules or selectional

4Possibly including classifications according to se-
mantically motivated lexeme classes and a modelling
of paradigmatic relations between lexemes, such as hy-
ponymy or synonymy.
5The term &amp;quot;collocation&amp;quot; was introduced into linguis-
tic discussion by John R. Firth (1951:94).

sis and collocate in the sense of [HAUSMANN 1985];
HAusmANN&apos;s original terms are Basis and Kollokator.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.843219666666667">
These considerations lead to two propos-
als for the structuring of the lexical knowledge
used in a generator:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.975681">
• Heuristic for the lexicalization process:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.954947029411765">
&amp;quot;First the basis is lexicalized,
then the collocate, depending
on which lexeme has been cho-
sen as the basis.&amp;quot;
• Knowledge about the possibility of com-
bining lexemes in collocations should be
stored in the lexicalization dictionary
(where lexicalization candidates for con-
cepts are provided), and specifically in the
entries for the bases.
The following table shows in terms of
categories7 what can be a possible collocate
for a particular basis8:
basis possible collocates
noun noun, verb , adjective
verb adverb
adjective adverb
?Unlike British Contextualism (cf. the recent
[SINCLAIR 1987]) we assume that bases and collocates
are of one of the following categories: noun, verb, ad-
jective or adverb.
8For substantive-verb-collocations, the classification
as basis and collocate is opposed to the usual syntac-
tic description according to head and modifier; this
has consequences for the lexicalization process: while
it is usually possible to first lexicalize the heads of
phrases, then the modifiers (e.g. substantivehead,b..., &lt;
adjectivemodifienceit.te, the choice of verbs depends
on their nominal complements (which are modifiers,
but which have to be considered as bases of colloca-
tions). This means that nouns have to be lexicalized be-
fore verbs, e.g. Pldne schmieden, but not *rite Vorsdtze
schmieden).

Meaning-Text-Theory as a tool
for the description of colloca-
tions
In MTT, developed by Mel&apos;euk and co-
workers, there exist about 60 &amp;quot;lexical func-
tions&amp;quot; which describe regular dependencies be-
tween lexical units of a language. In MTT,
lexical functions are understood as cross-
linguistically constant operators (f), whose
application to a lexeme (&amp;quot;keyword&amp;quot;, L)
yields other lexemes ( v). Mel&apos;euk (1984:6),
(1988:311) uses the following notation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.981016">
f(L) = v
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.991082827586207">
The result of the application of a lexi-
cal function to a given lexeme can be another
&amp;quot;one-word&amp;quot; lexeme, or a collocation, an idiom
or even an interjection.
The parallelism between the collocation
definition used in this paper and the notion
of lexical function is that both start from the
principle that collocates depend upon the re-
spective bases (in MTT, v is a function of L).
Therefore lexical functions seem to be a useful
device for the description of collocations in a
generation lexicon.
In the following, we only consider lexi-
cal functions which, when applied to a lex-
eme word, yield collocations9; Table 1 gives
some examples of such lexical functions, to-
gether with a definitional gloss, taken from
[STEELE/MEYER 1988110:
91t should be investigated to what extent the cat-
egory of v is predictable for every f, according to
the category of L. For instance, f&apos;s of group 1 and 2
specified in the table below, applied to nouns, yield
substantive+verb-collocations, those of groups 3 and
4 yield substantive+adjective-collocations, and those
of groups 5 and 6 return substantive-l-substantive-
collocations.
19Lexical functions of group 2, normally occur to-
gether with those from 1; ABLE only occurs in combi-
nation with other lexical functions.

3.2 The generation of paraphrases

<bodyText confidence="0.954883083333333">
One of the aims in the development of the
&amp;quot;how-to-say&amp;quot;-component of a generation sys-
tem is to ensure that variants (i.e. true para-
phrases) can be generated for one and the same
semantic structure.
This involves two types of knowledge:
more &apos;static&apos; knowledge about interchangeabil-
ity of realization variants (synonymous items,
information about paraphrase relations be-
tween certain constructions or between col-
locations) and more &apos;procedural&apos; knowledge
about heuristics guiding the choice between
candidates. The &apos;static&apos; knowledge should be
represented declaratively. It can be divided
into information about syntactic variants (e.g.
participle form vs. relative clause) and in-
formation about lexicalization variants. In
- 133 -
[MELtUK 1988]:38-41 rules are stated, which
express paraphrase relations between certain
types of collocations. Ideally these rules can
be set up for pairs of lexical functions, without
consideration of concrete lexemes. Examples

Within a generation system, such descrip-
tions can be used to state paraphrase rela-
tions between collocational lexicalization can-
didates. The choice between candidates de-
pends on parameters, amongst which the fol-

4 Conclusion and directions
for future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993103448276">
We propose a method for the description of
knowledge about collocations in the dictionary
of a multilingual generation system. Advan-
tages for text generation result from the ap-
plication of MTT&apos;s lexical functions and the
formulation of the heuristic discussed above.
In the generation literature, the gener-
ation of collocations is regarded as a prob-
lem (cf. [MATTHIESSEN 1988]). The only
system we know of, in which attempts have
been made to bring it to a solution, is ow-
GENES, a knowledge based• generation sys-
tem under development at Carnegie Mel-
lon University16. Our approach differs from
NIRENBURG&apos;S in that it introduces the dis-
tinction between basis and collocate. This
leads to differences in the lexicalization strat-
egy: within DIOGENES, heads are lexicalized
before modifiers, irrespective of word classes,
cf. [NIRENBURG/NIRENBURG 1988].; we
have come up with data that seems to favour
the distinction between basis and collocate.
Further contrastive descriptive work will
be the basis for a prototypical implementa-
tion within Polygloss. With respect to lexical
functions, some questions related to defaults
(e.g. syntactic realization defaults, inheritance
of collocational properties within lexem classes
etc.) should be investigated in more detail.

<abstract confidence="0.973909142857143">We present a proposal for the structuring collocation knowledge 1in the lexicon of a multilingual generation system and show to what extent it can be used in the process of lexical selection. This proposal is part of Polygloss, a new research project on multilingual generation, and it has been by work carried out in the SEMproject (see e.g. [RoSNER The descriptive approach presented in this proposal is based on a combination of results from recent lexicographical research and the application of Meaning-Text-Theory (MTT) (see e.g. [MEL&apos; UK et al. 1981], [MELtUK et al. 1984]). We first outline the overall structure of the dictionary system that is needed by a multilingual generator; section 2 gives an overview of the results of lexicographical work on collocations and compares them with &amp;quot;lexical functions&amp;quot; as used in Meaning- Text-Theory. Section 3 shows how we intend integrate collocations in the generation clic- &apos;We use the term &amp;quot;collocation&amp;quot; in the sense of [HAUSMANN 1985] referring to constraints on the cooccurrence of two lexeme words; the two elements are not completely freely combined, but one of them semantically determines the other one. Examples are instance a problem, dark, someone a risk, For a more detailed definition see section 2. 2Research reported in this paper is supported by the German Bundesministerium ffir Forschung und Technologie, BMFT, under grant No. 08 B 3116 3. The views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as positions of the project as a whole. tionary and how &amp;quot;lexical functions&amp;quot; can used in generation. 1 Lexical knowledge for multilingual generation Within a multilingual generation system, seems necessary to keep the dictionary ; modular as possible, separating informatic that pertains to different levels of linguist We assume that the system&apos;s le: ical knowledge is stored in the following typi of &amp;quot;specialized dictionaries&amp;quot;: • semantic: inventory of possible lexicaliz. tions of a concept in a given language; • syntactic: one inventory of realizatic classes per language, providing inform. tion about number, type and realizatic of the arguments of a given lexeme; • morphological: one inventory of infle tional classes per language. Since none of these levels of decsriptic is completely independent, the dictionaril should be linked to each other by means 1 cross-references and reference to class men bership. Templates and mechanisms alloy ing for explicit inheritance of shared prope ties, e.g. redundancy rules, will be used with more details on the dictionary structure si [HEID/MOMMA 1989]. - 130 restrictions (e.g. using semantic markers) are not adequate for the choice of collocates in the process of lexicalization. each of the layers. These mechanisms give access to the knowledge about the linguistic &amp;quot;behaviour&amp;quot; of lexemes needed in the process of 2 Approaches to the description of collocations 2.1 Contributions from lexicography tradition of British defines collocations on the basis of statistical assumptions about the probability of the cooccurence of two lexemes. Particularly frequent combinations of lexical units are regarded as collocations. A more detailed definition can be found in the work of Franz Josef Hausmann (1985:119): &amp;quot;One partner determines, another is determined. In other words: collocations have a basis and a cooccurring This determination manifests itself in so far as a given basis does not allow all of the collocates that would be possible according to general semantic coocurrence conditions, but a certain subset: so in French, son retenir sa haine, sa joie possibut *retenir desespoir not. The choice of collocates depends strongly on the lexeme that has been chosen as the basis; knowledge about possible collocations can only partly derived knowledge about general semantic properties of lexemes. Therefore general cooccurrence rules or selectional including classifications according to semantically motivated lexeme classes and a modelling of paradigmatic relations between lexemes, such as hyponymy or synonymy. term &amp;quot;collocation&amp;quot; was introduced into linguistic discussion by John R. Firth (1951:94). by the authors. We use the terms bathe sense of [HAUSMANN 1985]; original terms are These considerations lead to two proposals for the structuring of the lexical knowledge used in a generator: • Heuristic for the lexicalization process: &amp;quot;First the basis is lexicalized, then the collocate, depending on which lexeme has been chosen as the basis.&amp;quot; • Knowledge about the possibility of combining lexemes in collocations should be stored in the lexicalization dictionary (where lexicalization candidates for concepts are provided), and specifically in the entries for the bases. The following table shows in terms of what can be a possible collocate a particular basis possible collocates noun noun, verb , adjective verb adverb adjective adverb British Contextualism (cf. the recent [SINCLAIR 1987]) we assume that bases and collocates are of one of the following categories: noun, verb, adjective or adverb. substantive-verb-collocations, the classification as basis and collocate is opposed to the usual syntactic description according to head and modifier; this has consequences for the lexicalization process: while it is usually possible to first lexicalize the heads of then the modifiers (e.g. &lt; the choice of verbs depends on their nominal complements (which are modifiers, but which have to be considered as bases of collocations). This means that nouns have to be lexicalized beverbs, e.g. schmieden, not Vorsdtze schmieden). - 131 - 2.2 Lexical functions of the Meaning-Text-Theory as a tool for the description of collocations In MTT, developed by Mel&apos;euk and coworkers, there exist about 60 &amp;quot;lexical functions&amp;quot; which describe regular dependencies between lexical units of a language. In MTT, lexical functions are understood as crossconstant operators to a lexeme (&amp;quot;keyword&amp;quot;, yields other lexemes ( v). Mel&apos;euk (1984:6), (1988:311) uses the following notation: f(L) = v The result of the application of a lexical function to a given lexeme can be another &amp;quot;one-word&amp;quot; lexeme, or a collocation, an idiom or even an interjection. The parallelism between the collocation definition used in this paper and the notion of lexical function is that both start from the principle that collocates depend upon the rebases (in MTT, v is a function of Therefore lexical functions seem to be a useful device for the description of collocations in a generation lexicon. In the following, we only consider lexical functions which, when applied to a lexword, yield Table 1 gives some examples of such lexical functions, together with a definitional gloss, taken from should be investigated to what extent the catof v is predictable for every to category of instance, group 1 and 2 specified in the table below, applied to nouns, yield substantive+verb-collocations, those of groups 3 and 4 yield substantive+adjective-collocations, and those of groups 5 and 6 return substantive-l-substantivecollocations. functions of group 2, normally occur towith those from 1; occurs in combination with other lexical functions. 3 Generating Collocations We propose that every lexeme entry in the lex icalization dictionary contains slots for lexica functions, whose fillers are possible collocates within a slot/filler-notation as the one use in Polygloss, a (partial) lexical entry, e.g. fo be represented in the followinl way: (problem ( ) func (create, (real (solve, ...)) C...)) It might be possible to predict the type; of lexical functions applicable to a given lex eme from its membership in a semantic class Syntactic properties of bases and collocates ail accessible through reference to the realizatim lexicon.

This involves two types of knowledge: more &apos;static&apos; knowledge about interchangeability of realization variants (synonymous items, information about paraphrase relations between certain constructions or between collocations) and more &apos;procedural&apos; knowledge about heuristics guiding the choice between candidates. The &apos;static&apos; knowledge should be represented declaratively. It can be divided into information about syntactic variants (e.g. participle form vs. relative clause) and information about lexicalization variants. In - 133 - [MELtUK 1988]:38-41 rules are stated, which express paraphrase relations between certain types of collocations. Ideally these rules can be set up for pairs of lexical functions, without consideration of concrete lexemes. Examples axe: Jean mis Paul (=INCEP OPER1) John got angry with Paul 4---+ attire la colere de (=INCEP OPER2) Paul angered John. Jean pris enthousiasme pour cette decouverte. (=oP ER) John got enthusiastic about this discovery. 4---+ (A cause de cette decouverte) s&apos;est empare de (=FuNc) John was enthused by this discovery. Within a generation system, such descriptions can be used to state paraphrase relations between collocational lexicalization candidates. The choice between candidates depends on parameters, amongst which the following ones seem to be essential: • syntactic &amp;quot;behaviour&amp;quot; of the lexemes building up a collocation&apos; — in relation to roles in the frame structure to be realized; — in relation to the thematic structure of the intended utterance; plan to investigate to what extent it is possible to describe the syntactic form of certain collocations general rules. This is possible e.g. for LABOR, for lexical functions yielding collocations of the type of &amp;quot;Funktionsverbgeffige&amp;quot;: —• verb ( OBJ ) PRED) = ( ) PRED) = ( OBJ Y) PRED) = • markedness of lexemes (e.g. registers style); • general heuristics for text generation (e.f &amp;quot;avoid repetition&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;avoid deep embed ding&amp;quot; etc. ) In the following, we give an example fa the lexicalization possibilities that can be d( scribed with the proposed device: given the following (rudimentary) semanti process: there should be available the following it about collocations with basis&apos;s: FUNc(joie) = la joie de qn, causer de La joie chez qn OP ER( = qn, mettre qn en joie remplir qn de joie FUNc(joie) = joie s&apos;empare de qn La joie saisit qn, La joie nait dans le coeur de qn OP = qn se met choice between pends on whether (and how) the causality is t expressed. The choice between OPE FUNC on whether the r( of or of E should b( come the subject. process is meant to be a concept typi semantic relations; and are concepts. notation. The first two examples a] roughly equivalent to English make someone happy, fi with joy, the latter ones to - 134 - Here constraints caused by the syntax of the utterance to be generated play an important role: in a relative clause e.g. the antecedent has already been introduced. This fact limits the choice: • - ... et alors cette nouvelle arriva, qui ... — causa la joie de Pierre FUNC) mit Pierre joie FUNC) • . .. et alors Marie envoya cette nouvelle . se rejouit (= FUNC) se mit en joie (= FUNC) This example shows that the heuristic &amp;quot;lexicalize bases first, then collocates&amp;quot; interacts with constraints stemming e.g. from syntax; these constraints can also be produced by a text structuring component (decisions about topic, thematic order etc.). The modular design of the lexicon supports generation of variants by giving access to all information needed at the appropriate choicepoints. 4 Conclusion and directions for future work We propose a method for the description of knowledge about collocations in the dictionary of a multilingual generation system. Advantages for text generation result from the application of MTT&apos;s lexical functions and the formulation of the heuristic discussed above. In the generation literature, the generation of collocations is regarded as a problem (cf. [MATTHIESSEN 1988]). The only system we know of, in which attempts have been made to bring it to a solution, is ow- GENES, a knowledge based• generation system under development at Carnegie Mel- Our approach differs from NIRENBURG&apos;S in that it introduces the distinction between basis and collocate. This leads to differences in the lexicalization strategy: within DIOGENES, heads are lexicalized before modifiers, irrespective of word classes, cf. [NIRENBURG/NIRENBURG 1988].; we have come up with data that seems to favour the distinction between basis and collocate. Further contrastive descriptive work will be the basis for a prototypical implementation within Polygloss. With respect to lexical functions, some questions related to defaults (e.g. syntactic realization defaults, inheritance of collocational properties within lexem classes etc.) should be investigated in more detail. 4.1 Acknowledgements We would like to thank Sergei Nirenburg and our collegues at the IMS for the fruitful discussions in this paper.
