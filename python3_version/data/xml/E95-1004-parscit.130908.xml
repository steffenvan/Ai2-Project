1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981496924528302">
The Exoseme system [6, 7] is an operational applica-
tion which continuously analyses the economic flow
from Agence France Presse (AFP). AFP, which cov-
ers the current economic life of the major industri-
alised countries, transmits on average 400 dispatches
per day on this flow. Their content is drafted in
French in a journalistic style. Using this flow, Ex-
oseme feeds various users concerning precise and
varied subjects, for example, rating announcements,
company results, acquisitions, sectors of activity, ob-
servation of competition, partners or clients, etc. 50
such themes have currently been developed. They
rely on precise filtering of dispatches with highlight-
ing of sentences for fast reading.
Exoseme is composed of several modules: a mor-
phological analyser, a proper name module, a syn-
tactical analyser, a semantic analyser and a filtering
module. The proper name module has two goals
segmenting and categorising proper names. During
the whole processing of a dispatch, the proper name
module is involved in three different steps. First,
it segments proper names during the morphological
analysis. Second, it categorises proper names dur-
ing the semantic analysis. Third, it is invoked by
the filtering module to supply some more informa-
tion needed for routing the dispatch.
The proper name module is based on different
techniques which are used to detect and categorise
proper names depending on whether they are known
or unknown. Some of these techniques are taken
out of existing systems but they have been uni-
fied and completed in constructing this single oper-
ational module. Besides some innovative techniques
for desambiguating known proper names using the
context have been implemented.
2 Problems raised by proper
names in NLP
In the AFP flow, proper names constitute a signif-
icant part of the text. They account for approxi-
mately one third of noun groups and half the words
used in proper names do not belong to the French
vocabulary (e.g. family names, names of locations,
foreign words). In addition, the number of words
used in constructing proper names is potentially in-
finite.
The first step of the processing is segmentation,
i.e. accurate cutting-up of proper names in the text;
the second step is categorisation, i.e. the attribution
to each proper name of a conceptual category (indi-
vidual, company, location, etc.). It should be noted
that segmentation and categorisation are processed
differently depending on whether the proper name
is known or unknown.

2.1 Segmentation of proper names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999830307692308">
The segmentation of proper names enables the
synctactical analyser to be relieved, particularly
in the case of long proper names which contain
grammatical markers (e.g. prepositions, conjunc-
tions, commas, full stops). As illustrated in [4],
segmentation firstly prevents long proper names
from undertaking pointless analyses. For exam-
ple, for Caisse de Credit Agricole du Morbihan the
analyser will provide two interpretations depend-
ing on whether Morbihan is attached to Credit
Agricole or to Caisse. Moreover, proper names of-
ten constitute agrammatical segments that some-
times confuse the synctactical analyser. For exam-

pie, in the sentence The director of Dollfus, Mieg
and Cie has announced positive results, the anal-
yser has difficulties in finding that The director is
the subject of announce if it does not know the
company Dollfus, Mieg and Cie. In the Exoseme
process, the Sylex syntactical analyser delegates
the segmentation of these agrananaatical gaps to our
proper name module.
Segmentation of known proper names has al-
ready been studied and is treated in some systems
such as NameFinder [5]; segmentation of unknown
proper names based on pattern matching is imple-
mented in several systems [1, 2, 4, 9]; the morpho-
logical matching of acronyms is described in [11].
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9994">
2.2 Categorisation of proper names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960533333333">
Once the segmentation has been achieved, categori-
sation of proper names is necessary for the seman-
tic analyser. Categorisation maps proper names
into a set of concepts (e.g. human being, company,
location). The very nature of proper names con-
tributes widely to the understanding of texts. The
semantic analyser must be able to use the various
categories of proper names as semantic constraints
which are complementary for the understanding of
texts. For example, in the filtering theme of acqui-
sitions, the sentence Express group intends to sell
Le Point for 700 MF indicates a sale of interests in
the newspaper Le Point. Whereas the following sen-
tence, which is grammatically identical to the pre-
ceding one, Compagnie des Signaux intends to sell
TVM430 for 700 MF indicates only a price for an
industrial product.
Categorisation of unknown proper names has al-
ready been studied as well. Particularly, categori-
sation of unknown proper names is automatically
acquired in pattern matching techniques quoted in
previous section; rules using the context of proper
names in order to categorise them are also imple-
mented in [2, 9].
In our system, these ontological categories are
extended to attributes needed by the semantic anal-
yser or the filtering module. For instance, proper
names may have different attributes such as city,
rating agencies, sector of activity, market, financial
indexes, etc.

3 Representation of proper
names
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9956404">
We will see that the proper name module requires
a large amount of information concerning proper
names, their forms, their categories, their attributes,
the words of which they are composed, etc. This in-
formation must be able to be enriched in order to
include additional processes, and accessible in order
to be shared by several processes. We use a repre-
sentation system similar to conceptual graphs [10],
the flexibility of which effectively gives expressive-
ness, reusability and the possibility of further devel-
opment. It enables indispensable and heterogeneous
data to be memorised and used in order to process
proper names.
For a given proper name, its category and its var-
ious attributes are directly represented in the form
of a conceptual graph. For example, our knowledge
base contains the graphs of Figure 1. This simple
representation will be completed in the subsequent
sections. We are going to show how each encoun-
tered problem uses the information of the knowledge
base and may add its own information to it.
The final result is a large knowledge base in-
cluding 8,000 proper names sharing 10,000 forms,
based on 11,000 words. There are also 90 at-
tributes of proper names or words. Each new filter-
ing theme may be a special case and its implemen-
tation may lead to introduce additional attributes
into the knowledge base. The adopted representa-
tional formalism enables these additions to be made
without leading to substantial modifications of its
structure.
4 Processing known proper
names
Firstly, we recognise the proper names in which we
are directly interested in order to allocate to them
attributes which are required for subsequent pro-
cesses. We also seek to recognise the most frequent
proper names (e.g. country, cities, regions, states-
men) in order to segment them and categorise them
correctly.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989265">
4.1 Immediate recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996148">
The first idea which comes to mind is to memorise
the proper names as they are encountered in the
dispatches and to allocate to them the attributes.
All this information is stored in the knowledge base
which contains, for example :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99344075">
• &amp;quot;New&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;York&amp;quot; PN -4 location
• &amp;quot;Societe&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;Generale&amp;quot; PN bank
• &amp;quot;Standard&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;Poor&apos;s&amp;quot; PN
rating agency
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988525">
The knowledge base is thus structured on the
model showed in Figure 2. And subsequently, recog-
nition of the proper name in the text occurs through
simple pattern matching.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.549444">
4.2 &amp;quot;Equivalent&amp;quot; words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999819">
However, words making up proper names accept
many slippages which result from abbreviations,
translation, common faults, etc. For example :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981559888888889">
• a french group in the food production industry,
• les Cristalleries de Saint Louis,
• a small town in Bas-Rhin province,

</author>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962916666667">
In order to avoid listing pointlessly all the forms
that a proper name can take, through slippages of its
words, certain variations in the recorded form are au-
thorised. To this end, slippages in a given word are
grouped around an &amp;quot;equivalent&amp;quot;. This technique,
which has been developed in the NameFinder sys-
tem [5], under the term &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; words, enables
to make a correspondence with different forms likely
to appear.
Equivalent words are expressed in the knowledge
base through a relationship. For example, our base
contains the graph of Figure 3.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998228">
4.3 Synonymous proper names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999920944444444">
However, one can use very different proper names
to designate a given reality. For example, we can
find simple synonyms such as Hexagone for France
or Rue d&apos;Antin for Paribas. This notion is similar
to alternative names in [5]. Dispatches also contain
more or less complex transformations, that it can
be difficult to derive from the standard form, such
as NewYork and NY for New York, or indeed SetP and
S-Poors for Standard and Poor&apos;s.
Once again, in order to avoid listing pointlessly
the attributes for all the necessary proper names,
the forms of synonymous proper names are grouped
around a single reference to which the various at-
tributes are allocated. This grouping enables the
various references memorised to be represented, and
their attributes to be factorised. The knowledge
base is modified according to the enriched model
showed in Figure 4.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998968">
4.4 Disambiguating proper names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999552714285714">
When a user is interested in a given proper name, it
is not sufficient to look for it through the dispatches
since a simple selection on this name frequently pro-
duces homonyms. Such interference, which is annoy-
ing for users, reflects the limitations of traditional
keyword systems. In the AFP flow, for example, the
form Saint-Louis may designate equally well:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.957834">
• the capital of Missouri,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.938495">
The crucial problem posed is to succeed in dis-
ambiguating this type of forms. Or, in other words,
in determining, or at least in delimiting, the denoted
reference.
4.4.1 Disambiguating through the local con-
text
Exploration of the local context using the proper
name can in certain cases enable a choice to be made
between these various references. If the text speaks
of St-Louis (Missouri), only the first interpretation
will be adopted, if the knowledge base contains the
information that Saint-Louis is in the United States,
and if a rule is able to interpret the affixing of a
parenthesis. We are currently working on this del-
icate aspect in order to unify all the rules we have
accumulated for resolving concrete cases. We are
aware that these types of inference are comparable
to the micro-theories of the Cyc project [8] in which
the need for a great amount of information is the
main thesis.
We will see in section 5.2.1 that the local con-
text may categorise an unknown proper name and
therefore it may help to desambiguate an ambigu-
ous known proper name. For instance, if the text
speaks of the mayor of St-Louis, the company and
hospital can certainly be ruled out.
</bodyText>

4.4.2 Disambiguating through the global

<bodyText confidence="0.967946263157895">
context
Abbreviations of proper names are another, much
more frequent, source of ambiguities. Depending
on the context, la Generale may designate Societe
Generale, Compagnie Generale des Eaux or indeed
Generale de Sucriere. Similarly, acronyms, which
are almost always common to several proper names,
constitute an extreme form of abbreviation. We thus
discover from time to time new organisations which
share the acronym CDC with Caisse des Depots et
Consignat ion.
In general, ambiguous forms are not used on their
own in dispatches, and other non-ambiguous forms
appear. Their presence consequently enables the
ambiguity to be removed. If the proper names Saint
Louis and Hopital Saint Louis appear in a single
dispatch, for example, the reference corresponding
to the hospital will have more forms than each of
the others and will thus be the only one adopted.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990009">
26
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.977170636363637">
Consequently, when there is an interest in an
individual reference and the corpus has revealed
homonyms, we record them in the knowledge base.
We link them with the individual reference in order
to be able to manage the ambiguities.
Nevertheless, when the ambiguity is unable to
be removed, we choose the most frequent interpre-
tation, but the user is told of the doubtful nature
of our choice. In the dispatch title &amp;quot;saint Louis:
results up&amp;quot;, for example, the proper name Saint
Louis is processed as the food production group,
which is the most frequent case, although it could
equally well designate les Cristalleries.
5 Processing unknown proper
names
The preceding techniques tackled the problem of the
variability of known proper names. However, al-
though many proper names appear frequently, oth-
ers appear only once. Even if the constituted knowl-
edge base is very comprehensive, it is absolutely.im-
possible to record all potential proper names. We
have therefore to deal with unknown proper names.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994797">
5.1 Prototypes of proper names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998776">
As fully explained in [2], some proper names are con-
structed according to prototypes which enable them
to be categorised through their appearance alone.
For example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997725857142857">
• known-first-name + unknown-upcase-word
human being (e.g. Andre Blavier)
• unknown-upcase-word + company-legal-form
company (e.g. Kyocera Corp)
• unknown-upcase-word + &amp;quot;-sur-&amp;quot; +
unknown-upcase-word —4 location
(e.g. Conde-sur-Huisne)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.944313666666667">
Furthermore, certain categories of proper names
accept traditional extensions which it is also possible
to detect. For example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990602125">
• known-human-being + human-title
human being (e.g. Kennedy Jr)
• known-company + company-activity company
(e.g. Honda Motor)
• known-company + &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; + known-location
company (e.g. IBM-France)
• known-human-being + company-activity
company (e.g. Bernard Tapie Finance)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9784252">
Lastly, such extensions may be combined,
e.g. &amp;quot;Siam Nissan Automobile Co Ltd&amp;quot; is probably a
subsidiary of Nissan.
These prototypes enable both to segment and
categorise proper names. Of course, they do not
constitute infallible rules (for example, Guy Laroche
is a company while its prototype makes one believe
it is a human being) but they give correct results in
a large majority of cases.
In order to use these prototypes, we build a
rulebase for detecting and extending proper names.
Moreover, we add some attributes to the existing
words in our knowledge base (e.g. first names, legal
company forms, company activities). For example,
it contains the graph of Figure 5.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.5509535">
5.2 Other techniques of categorisa-
tion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878">
Nevertheless, a prototype is not always enough to
categorise a proper name. In particular, an isolated
proper name does not enable one to infer its category
directly. For example, who can say simply on sight
of the proper name that Peskine is an individual,
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.567348">
Fibaly a company and Gisenyi a town?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.843242833333333">
5.2.1 Categorisation through the local con-
text
However, the text often contains elements enabling
one to deduce the category of a proper name [2].
To this end, rules using the local context give good
results. For example :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986569333333333">
• apposition of an individual&apos;s position :
Peskine, director of the group,
• name complement typical of a company :
the shareholders of Fibaly
• name complement typical of a location :
the mayor of Gisenyi.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9893145">
These rules once again require that certain words
from the knowledge base are marked by individual
attributes. For example, the word &amp;quot;mayor&amp;quot; has both
the following attributes :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991737">
• human-being-apposition:
(e.g. Chirac, mayor of the town)
• location-name-complement :
(e.g. the mayor of Royan)

<bodyText confidence="0.988524904761905">
5.2.2 Categorisation through the global con-
text
However, the local context of a proper name does not
necessarily enable one to infer its category. For in-
stance, the mere radical of a proper name (e.g. fam-
ily name, main company) is often used later in the
text instead of the full name. The company Kyocera
corp, for example, may be designated by the single
word Kyocera in the remainder of the text.
Consequently, for each unknown proper name,
we look to see whether it does not appear in another
proper name in the text. In this case, we estab-
lish a link between these two proper names in order
to transfer the attributes of the recognised proper
name to this new proper name. However, one should
always beware since different proper names some-
times share the same radical : Mr Mitterand and Mrs
Mitterand, Or again Mr Bo&apos;lore and Bollore Group.
Although, in the most frequent cases, we resolve this
well-known problem but as in [11] we do not have a
general solution.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997531">
5.3 Matching acronyms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903764705882">
Acronyms occur frequently in AFP dispaches. On
one hand, the linguistical construction of the cor-
responding text of acronyms may be relatively com-
plex. On the other hand, in some case, the relatively
simple morphological construction of acronyms may
be treated with a simple pattern matching with
the corresponding text. Moreover, acronyms are
widespread ambiguous forms of which it is unthink-
able to list all cases and we have seen in section
4.4.2 that desambiguation of proper names needed
to memorize all potential homonyms. Therefore,
a process for dealing with acronyms will first seg-
ment these unknown proper names and second de-
sambiguate these potential homonyms.
In general, when an acronym is introduced in a
text, its complete form is given using parentheses.
For example :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991556571428571">
• International Primary Aluminium Institute
(IPAI)
• AIEA (Agence Internationale de l&apos; Energie
Atomique)
• Centre de recherche, d&apos;etudes et de
documentation en economie de la sante
(CREDES)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944588235294">
As observed in [11], it is possible to explore the
local structure of the parentheses in order to de-
termine whether the acronym corresponds to the
complete form and, if so, the acronym and the full
name are propagated throughout the remainder of
the text. Some words (e.g. articles, prepositions)
may be jumped when matching up acronyms and
text. For example, the acronym SBF of Societe des
Bourses Frangaises omits the preposition &amp;quot;des&amp;quot;,
while the acronym BDF of Banque de France keeps the
&amp;quot;de&amp;quot;. In order for our processing module to recog-
nise these words, we allocate a special attribute to
them in the knowledge base.
This simple and effective technique enables most
of the acronyms introduced to be processed cor-
rectly. Only foreign acronyms accompanied by their
translation are not processed.

Built for an operationnal system which filters in real
time AFP dispatches, we have presented the mod-
ule for the automatic processing of proper names.
This module unifies and completes known techniques
which enable to segment and categorise proper
names. Particularly, we have explained our inno-
vative technique for disambiguating known proper
names and its relationship with the techniques for
categorising unknown proper names and for match-
ing acronyms. Our system currently detects 90%
of proper names in AFP dispatches and categorises
85% of them correctly. The full Exoserne pro-
cess is undertaken in approximately 14 seconds
per dispatch on a SUN SPARC 10, i.e. in 1,400
words/minute approximately.
We consider continuing with our work relating
to the exploration of the local context (Cf. 4.4.1
and 5.2.1) in two complementary directions. From
the grammatical point of view, our exploration of
the context is incomplete. For example, we do not
categorise the unknown proper name in a complex
case such as Its Belgian subsidiary specialising
in flat products Nokia. From the semantic point
of view, we do not use all the contextual data. For
example, the sentence The company already serves
Houston, Saint-Louis and Dallas should be suffi-
cient to disambiguate Saint-Louis. We are cur-
rently accumulating examples in which the local con-
text enables certain proper names to be categorised
and/or to be disambiguated. Our next step will con-
sist in tightening cooperation with the following lay-
ers in order to use the grammatical and semantic
data they provide in the whole process.

For instance, proper names may have different attributes such as city, rating agencies, sector of activity, market, financial indexes, etc. 3 Representation of proper names We will see that the proper name module requires a large amount of information concerning proper names, their forms, their categories, their attributes, the words of which they are composed, etc. This information must be able to be enriched in order to include additional processes, and accessible</context>

However, although many proper names appear frequently, others appear only once. Even if the constituted knowledge base is very comprehensive, it is absolutely.impossible to record all potential proper names. We have therefore to deal with unknown proper names. 5.1 Prototypes of proper names As fully explained in [2], some proper names are constructed according to prototypes which enable them to be categorised through their appearance alone. For example: • known-first-name + unknown-upcase-word human being (e.g. Andre Blavier) • unknown-upcase-word + company-legal-form company (e.g. Kyocera Corp) • unknown-upcase-word + &amp;quot;-sur-&amp;quot; + unknown-upcase-word —4 location (e.g. Conde-sur-Huisne) Furthermore, certain categories of proper names accept traditional extensions which it is also possible to detect. For example: • known-human-being + human-title human being (e.g. Kennedy Jr) • known-company + company-activi</context>

For example, it contains the graph of Figure 5. 5.2 Other techniques of categorisation Nevertheless, a prototype is not always enough to categorise a proper name. In particular, an isolated proper name does not enable one to infer its category directly. For example, who can say simply on sight of the proper name that Peskine is an individual, Fibaly a company and Gisenyi a town? 5.2.1 Categorisation through the local context However, the text often contains elements enabling one to deduce the category of a proper name [2]. To this end, rules using the local context give good results. For example : • apposition of an individual&apos;s position : Peskine, director of the group, • name complement typical of a company : the shareholders of Fibaly • name complement typical of a location : the mayor of Gisenyi. These rules once again require that certain words from the knowledge base are marked by individual attributes. For example, the word &amp;quot;mayor&amp;quot; has both the following attributes : • human-being-apposition: (e.g. Chirac, mayor of the town) • location-name-complement : (e.g. the mayor of Royan) 27 Figure 5: Words and P</context>

It should be noted that segmentation and categorisation are processed differently depending on whether the proper name is known or unknown. 2.1 Segmentation of proper names The segmentation of proper names enables the synctactical analyser to be relieved, particularly in the case of long proper names which contain grammatical markers (e.g. prepositions, conjunctions, commas, full stops). As illustrated in [4], segmentation firstly prevents long proper names from undertaking pointless analyses. For example, for Caisse de Credit Agricole du Morbihan the analyser will provide two interpretations depending on whether Morbihan is attached to Credit Agricole or to Caisse. Moreover, proper names often constitute agrammatical segments that sometimes confuse the synctactical analyser. For exam23 pie, in the sentence The director of Dollfus, Mieg and Cie has announced positive results, the analyser has difficulties in finding that The director is the subject of announce if it does not know the company Dollf</context>

To this end, slippages in a given word are grouped around an &amp;quot;equivalent&amp;quot;. This technique, which has been developed in the NameFinder system [5], under the term &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; words, enables to make a correspondence with different forms likely to appear. Equivalent words are expressed in the knowledge base through a relationship. For example, our base contains the graph of Figure 3. 4.3 Synonymous proper names However, one can use very different proper names to designate a given reality. For example, we can find simple synonyms such as Hexagone for France or Rue d&apos;Antin for Paribas. This notion is similar to alternative names in [5].

If the text speaks of St-Louis (Missouri), only the first interpretation will be adopted, if the knowledge base contains the information that Saint-Louis is in the United States, and if a rule is able to interpret the affixing of a parenthesis. We are currently working on this delicate aspect in order to unify all the rules we have accumulated for resolving concrete cases. We are aware that these types of inference are comparable to the micro-theories of the Cyc project [8] in which the need for a great amount of information is the main thesis. We will see in section 5.2.1 that the local context may categorise an unknown proper name and therefore it may help to desambiguate an ambiguous known proper name. For instance, if the text speaks of the mayor of St-Louis, the company and hospital can certainly be ruled out. 4.4.2 Disambiguating through the global context Abbreviations of proper names are another, much more frequent, source of ambiguities.

It enables indispensable and heterogeneous data to be memorised and used in order to process proper names. For a given proper name, its category and its various attributes are directly represented in the form of a conceptual graph. For example, our knowledge base contains the graphs of Figure 1.
