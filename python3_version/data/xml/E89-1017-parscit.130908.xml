<bodyText confidence="0.999975214285714">
The paper presents some of the results
obtained within a research project aimed at
developing ET (English Tutor), an intelligent
tutoring system which supports Italian
students in learning the English verbs. We
concentrate on one of the most important
modules of the system, the domain (i.e. verb)
expert which is devoted to generate, in a cog-
nitively transparent way, the right tense for
the verb(s) appearing in the exercises
presented to the student. An example which
highlights the main capabilities of the verb
expert is provided. A prototype version of ET
has been fully implemented.

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99559558974359">
In the course of its evolution, English has lost
most of the complexities which still
characterize other Indo-European languages.
Modern English, for example, has no
declensions, it makes minimum use of the
subjunctive mood and adopts &apos;natural&apos; gender
instead of the grammatical one. The
language, on the other hand, has become
more precise in other ways: cases have thus
been replaced by prepositions and fixed word
order while subtle meaning distinctions can be
conveyed through a highly sophisticated use
of tense expressions. Learning correct verb
usage is however extremely difficult for non
native speakers and causes troubles to people
who study English as a foreign language. In
order to overcome the difficulties which can
be found in this and several other grammatical
areas, various attempts have been made to
utilize Artificial Intelligence techniques for
developing very sophisticated systems, called
Intelligent Tutoring Systems, in the specify
domain of foreign language teachinl
(Barchan, Woodmansee, and Yazdani, 1985
Cunningham, Iberall, and Woolf, 1986
Schuster and Finin, 1986; Weischedel, Voge
and James, 1978; Zoch, Sabah, and Alvisei
1986).
An Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS, fo
short) is a program capable of providinl
students with tutorial guidance in a give]
subject (Lawler and Yazdani, 1987; Sleema]
and Brown, 1982; Wenger, 1987). A full
fledged ITS: (a) has specific domai]
expertise; (b) is capable of modeling th
student knowledge in order to discover th
reason(s) of his mistakes, and (c) is able ti
make teaching more effective by applyin,
different tutorial strategies. ITS technolog:
seems particularly promising in fields, lik
language teaching, where a solid core of fact
is actually surrounded by a more nebulou
area in which subtle discriminations, persona
points of view, and pragmatic factors ar
involved (Close, 1981).
In this paper we present some of the result
obtained within a research project aimed a
developing ET (English Tutor), an ITS whicl
helps Italian students to learn the English yeti
system. An overall description of ET, of it
structure and mode of operation has bee&apos;
given elsewhere (Fum, Giangrandi, an
Tasso, 1988). We concentrate here on one lo
the most important modules of the system, th
domain (i.e. verb) expert which is devoted t1
generate, in a cognitively transparent way, th
right tense for the verb(s) appearing in th
exercises presented to the student. The pape
analyzes some issues that have been deal
with in developing the verb expert focusin
- 124 -
on the knowledge and processing mecha-
nisms utilized. The paper is organized as
follows. Section two introduces our approach
to the problem of tense generation in the
context of a tutor for second language
teaching. Section three briefly illustrates the
ET general architecture and mode of
operation. Section four constitutes the core of
the paper and presents the design re-
quirements, knowledge bases and reasoning
algorithms of the verb expert together with an
example which highlights its main
capabilities. The final section deals with the
relevance of the present proposal both in the
framework of linguistic studies on verb
generation and of intelligent tutoring systems
for language teaching.

2. THE TENSE GENERATION
PROBLEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999618966666667">
An important part of the meaning of a
sentence is constituted by temporal
information. Every complete sentence must
contain a main verb and this verb, in all Indo-
European languages, is temporally marked.
The tense of the verb indicates the relation
between the interval or instant of time in
which the situation (i.e. state, event, activity
etc.) described in the sentence takes place and
the moment in which the sentence is uttered,
and may also indicate subtle temporal
relations between the main situation and other
situations described or referenced in the same
sentence. Other information can be derived
from the mood and aspect of the verb, from
the lexical category which the verb is a
member of and, more generally, from several
kinds of temporal expressions that may
appear in the sentence. Moreover, the choice
of the tense is determined by other
information, not directly related with temporal
meaning, such as speaker&apos;s intention and
perspective, rhetoric characteristics of
discourse, etc. Very complex relations exist
among all these features which native
speakers take into account in understanding a
sentence or in generating an appropriate tense
for a given clause or sentence.
The problem of choosing the right verb tense
in order to convey the exact meaning a
sentence is intended to express has aroused
the interest of linguists, philosophers, logi-
cians and people interested in computational
accounts of language usage (see, for example:
Ehrich, 1987; Fuenmayor, 1987;
Matthiessen, 1984). There is however no
agreement on, and no complete theoretical
account of, the factors which contribute to
tense generation. The different proposals
which exist in the literature greatly vary
according to the different features that are
actually identified as being critical and their
level of explicitness, i.e. which features are
given directly to the tense selection process
and which must be inferred through some
form of reasoning
Our interest in this topic focuses on
developing a system for tense selection
capable of covering most of the cases which
can be found in practice and usable for
teaching English as a foreign language. A
basic requirement which we have followed in
designing ET is its cognitive adequacy: not
only the final result (i.e. the tense which is
generated), but also the knowledge and
reasoning used in producing it should mirror
those utilized by a human expert in the field
(i.e. by a competent native speaker). The ITS
must thus be an &apos;articulated&apos; or &apos;glass-box&apos;
expert.
</bodyText>

3. THE ET SYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99484875">
ET is an intelligent tutoring system devoted to
support Italian students in learning the usage
of English verbs. The system, organized
around the classical architecture of an ITS
(Sleeman and Brown 1982), consists
essentially of:
- the Tutor, which is devoted to manage the
teaching activity and the interaction with the
student,
- the Student Modeler which is able to
evaluate the student&apos;s competence in the
specific domain, and
- the Domain (i.e. verb) Expert which is an
articulated expert in the specific domain dealt
with by the system.
In what follows, in order to better understand
the discussion of the Domain Expert, a
sketchy account of the system mode of
operation is given.
- 125 -
At the beginning of each session, the Tutor
starts the interaction with the student by
presenting him an exercise on a given topic.
The same exercise is given to the Domain
Expert which will provide both the correct
solution and a trace of the reasoning
employed for producing it. At this point, the
Student Modeler compares the answer of the
student with that of the expert in order to
identify the errors, if any, present in the
former and to formulate some hypotheses
about their causes. On the basis of these hy-
potheses, the Tutor selects the next exercise
which will test the student on the critical
aspects pointed out so far and will allow the
Modeler to gather further information which
could be useful for refining the hypotheses
previously drawn. Eventually, when some
misconceptions have been identified, the
refined and validated hypotheses will be used
in order to explain the errors to the student
and to suggest possible remediations. When a
topic has been thoroughly analyzed, the Tutor
will possibly switch to other topics.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.99657" genericHeader="method">
4. THE DOMAIN EXPERT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999547666666667">
The Domain Expert is devoted to generate the
right answers for the exercises proposed to
the student. Usually, exercises are constituted
by a few English sentences in which some of
the verbs (open items) are given in infinitive
form and have to be conjugated into an
appropriate tense. Sometimes, in order to
avoid ambiguities, additional information
describing the correct interpretation (as far as
the temporal point of view is concerned) of
the sentence is given. Consequently, the
Domain Expert must be able:
i) to select the grammatical tense to employ
for each open item of the exercise in order to
correctly describe the status of the world the
sentence is intended to represent, and
ii) to appropriately conjugate the verb
according to the chosen tense.
Besides these basic functionalities, the
tutoring environment in which the Domain
Expert operates imposes a further
requirement, i.e. the expert must be able:
iii) to explain to the student how the solution
has been found, which kind of knowledge
has been utilized, and why.
While the sentences that are presented to the
student are in natural language form, the verb
expert receives in input a schematic
description of the sentence.
Every sentence of the exercise is constituted
by one or more clauses playing a particular
role in it (major clauses and minor clauses at
various levels of subordination). Each clause
is represented inside the system through a
series of attribute-value pairs (called exercise
descriptors) that highlight the information
relevant for the tense selection process. This
information includes, for example, the kind of
clause (main, coordinate, subordinate),
whether the clause has a verb to be solved,
the voice and form of the clause, the kind of
event described by the clause, the time
interval associated with the event described in
the clause, etc. Some of the exercise
descriptors must be manually coded and
inserted in the exercise data base whereas the
others (mainly concerning purely linguistic
features) can be automatically inferred by a
preprocessor devoted to parsing the exercise
text. For instance, the schematic description
of:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.905713333333333">
ET &gt; EXERCISE-1:
&apos;I (live) in this house for ten years. Now the
roof needs repairing.&apos;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992406">
is the following (with the items automatically
inferred by the parser preceded by the symbol
@):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.602294172413793">

<bodyText confidence="0.95624325">
When solving an open item, the Domain
Expert must infer from the exercise
descriptors all the remaining information
needed to make the final choice of the
appropriate tense. This information is
constituted by several tense features, each one
describing some facet of the situation that is
necessary to take into account. The choice of
which tense features are to be considered in
the tense selection process represents a
fundamental step in the design of the verb
generation module. This problem has no
agreed upon solution, and it constitutes one of
the most critical parts of any theory of tense
generation (Ehrich, 1987; Fuenmayor, 1987;
Matthiessen, 1984). The main features
considered by the Domain Expert are listed
below. Some of the features are already
included in the exercise descriptors (1 to 4),
whereas the others must be inferred by the
system when solving the exercise (5 to 8):
1. Category, which identifies the kind of
situation described by the clause (e.g., event,
state, action, activity, etc.).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988472117647059">
2. Aspect, which concerns the different
viewpoints that can be utilized for describing
a situation.
3. Intentionality, which states whether the
situation describes a course of action that has
been premeditated or not.
4. Context, which concerns the type of
discourse in which the clause or sentence
appears.
5. Duration, which refers to the time span
(long, short, instantaneous, etc.) occupied by
a situation.
6. Perspective, which refers to the position
along the temporal axis of the situation or to
its relation with the present time.
7. Temporal Relations, which refer to the
temporal relations (simultaneity, contiguity,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991839833333333">
precedence, etc.) that occur between the
situation dealt with in the current clause and
the situations described in other clauses.
8. Adverbial Information, which is related to
the meaning of possible temporal adverbials
specified in the same clause.
The Domain Expert operation is supported by
a knowledge base constituted by a partitioned
set of production rules which express in a
transparent and cognitively consistent way
what is necessary to do in order to generate a
verb tense. Its activity is mostly concerned
with the derivation of the tense features
strictly related to temporal reasoning. The
exercise descriptors include for this purpose
only basic information related to the specific
temporal adverbials or conjunctions which
appear in the exercise. This information is
utilized to build a temporal model of the
situation described in the exercise. Initially,
the temporal model is only partially known
and is then augmented through the application
of a set of temporal relation rules. This rules
constitute a set of axioms of a temporal logic -
similar to that utilized by Allen (1984)- which
has been specifically developed for: (a)
representing the basic temporal knowledge
about the situations described in the exercise;
(b) reasoning about these knowledge in order
to compute some of the tense features not
explicitly present in the schematic description
of the exercise. The first task of the expert
module is therefore that of deriving possible
new relations which hold among situations
described in the exercise.
In the schematic description of exercise 1 we
can see two time relations explicitly asserted:
meet(t2, now) and
equal(t1 , 12).
The meaning of the first clause is that the time
interval 12 (corresponding to the temporal
expression &apos;for ten years&apos;) precedes and is
contiguous to the time interval indicated by
now (i.e. the speaking time). The meaning of
the second clause is that the time interval ti
(representing the state or event expressed by
the main verb) is equal to the time interval 12.
From the explicit time relation it is possible to
derive, by employing the following time
relation rule:
meet(tx, ty) &amp; equal(tx, tz) =&gt; meet(tz, ty).
the inferred relation:
- 127 -
meet(tl, now).
The Domain Expert tries then to infer, for
every exercise clause, the so-called reference
time, i.e., the moment of time which the
situation described in the sentence refers to
(Matthiessen, 1984; Fuenmayor, 1987). In
order to determine the reference time of every
clause, the expert utilizes a set of reference
time identification rules whose condition part
takes into account the structural description of
the sentence.
An example of reference time identification
rule is the following:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.875507285714286">
IF
1 - clause_kind = main,
2- previous_coordinate = nil OR
new_speaker = nil OR
clause_form = interrogative,
3 - time_expression &lt;&gt; nil
THEN
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997783958333333">
set the reference_time to the most specific
time expression
By applying this rule to the structural
description of Exercise 1 it is possible to infer
that the reference time of the clause c 1 is the
interval t2 that, being the only time expression
present in the clause, is also the most specific
one.
When all the reference times have been
determined, the Domain Expert looks only for
the clauses with open items in order to
compute (through the temporal axioms) three
particular temporal relations (Ehrich, 1987):
deictic (between reference time and speaking
time: RT-ST), intrinsic (between event time
and reference time: ET-RT) and ordering
(between event time and speaking time: ET-
ST). When these relations have been
computed, all the needed tense features are
known, and the final tense selection can be
performed. Again, a set of selection rules
takes care of this activity.
In our example, the following selection rules
can be applied:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.802103" genericHeader="method">
IF
</sectionHeader>
<footnote confidence="0.724271">
1 - category = state OR
category = iterated_action,
2- meet(event_time, now),
3 - meet(reference_time, now),
</footnote>
<figure confidence="0.961521214285714">
4 - equal(event_time, reference_time),
5 - aspect = persistent
THEN
apply the present perfect tense.
IF
1 - category = single_action OR
category = state,
2- meet(event_time, now),
3 - meet(reference_time, now),
4- equal(event_time, reference_time),
5 - duration &lt;&gt; short,
6 - aspect = persistent,
7 - context &lt;&gt; formal,
8 - verb accepts ing_form

which provide two different (both correc
solutions for the open item.
Once the tense to be used has been identifiei
the verb is conjugated utilizing an appropria
set of conjugation rules. In our example ti
present perfect is obtained through ti
application, among others, of the followir
rules:

5. CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995982055555556">
In the paper we have presented some issul
involved in the design of a verb generatic
module within a research project aimed
developing an ITS capable of teaching ti
English verb system. A first prototype of E
has been fully implemented in MRS (LIS
augmented with logic and rule-programmir
capabilities and with specific mechanism fl
representing meta-knowledge) on a SUN
workstation.
- 128 -
Our primary goal in this phase of the project
has been the cognitive adequacy of the verb
expert. In order to develop it, we took a
pragmatic approach, starting with the
identification of the features traditionally
considered by grammars, constructing rules
of tense selection grounded on this features
and, finally, refining features and rules
according to the results obtained through their
use.
The work presented here relates both to the
research carried out in the fields of linguistics
and philosophy, concerning theories of verb
generation and the temporal meaning of
verbs, respectively, and the field of intelligent
tutoring systems. As far as the first topic is
concerned, we claim that teaching a foreign
language can constitute a good benchmark for
evaluating the soundness and completeness of
such theories. In the field of foreign language
teaching, on the other hand, the only way to
build articulated, glass-box experts is to
provide them with language capabilities such
as those devised and described by linguistic
theories.

The main features considered by the Domain Expert are listed below. Some of the features are already included in the exercise descriptors (1 to 4), whereas the others must be inferred by the system when solving the exercise (5 to 8): 1.

When all the reference times have been determined, the Domain Expert looks only for the clauses with open items in order to compute (through the temporal axioms) three particular temporal relations (Ehrich, 1987): deictic (between reference time and speaking time: RT-ST), intrinsic (between event time and reference time: ET-RT) and ordering (between event time and speaking time: ETST). When these relations have been computed, all the needed tense features are known, and the final tense selection can be performed. Again, a set of selection rules takes care of this activity. In our example, the following selection rules can be applied: IF 1 - category = state OR category = iterated_action, 2- meet(event_time, now), 3 - meet(reference_time, now), 4 - equal(event_time, reference_time), 5 - aspect = persis</context>

A basic requirement which we have followed in designing ET is its cognitive adequacy: not only the final result (i.e. the tense which is generated), but also the knowledge and reasoning used in producing it should mirror those utilized by a human expert in the field (i.e. by a competent native speaker). The ITS must thus be an &apos;articulated&apos; or &apos;glass-box&apos; expert. 3. THE ET SYSTEM ET is an intelligent tutoring system devoted to support Italian students in learning the usage of English verbs. The system, organized around the classical architecture of an ITS (Sleeman and Brown 1982), consists essentially of: - the Tutor, which is devoted to manage the teaching activity and the interaction with the student, - the Student Modeler which is able to evaluate the student&apos;s competence in the specific domain, and - the Domain (i.e. verb) Expert which is an articulated expert in the specific domain dealt with by the system.
