Myanmar language and script are unique and
complex. Up to our knowledge, considerable
amount of work has not yet been done in
describing Myanmar script using formal language
theory. This paper presents manually constructed
context free grammar (CFG) with “111”
productions to describe the Myanmar Syllable
Structure. We make our CFG in conformity with
the properties of LL(1) grammar so that we can
apply conventional parsing technique called
predictive top-down parsing to identify Myanmar
syllables. We present Myanmar syllable structure
according to orthographic rules. We also discuss
the preprocessing step called contraction for
vowels and consonant conjuncts. We make LL (1)
grammar in which “1” does not mean exactly one
character of lookahead for parsing because of the
above mentioned contracted forms. We use five
basic sub syllabic elements to construct CFG and
found that all possible syllable combinations in
Myanmar Orthography can be parsed correctly
using the proposed grammar.

<bodyText confidence="0.99980084">
Formal Language Theory is a common way to
represent grammatical structures of natural
languages and programming languages. The
origin of grammar hierarchy is the pioneering
work of Noam Chomsky (Noam Chomsky,
1957). A huge amount of work has been done in
Natural Language Processing where Chomsky`s
grammar is used to describe the grammatical
rules of natural languages. However, formulation
rules have not been established for grammar for
Myanmar script. The long term goal of this study
is to develop automatic syllabification of
Myanmar polysyllabic words using regular
grammar and/or finite state methods so that
syllabified strings can be used for Myanmar
sorting.
In this paper, as a preliminary stage, we describe
the structure of a Myanmar syllable in context-
free grammar and parse the syllables using
predictive top-down parsing technique to
determine whether a given syllable can be
recognized by the proposed grammar or not.
Further, the constructed grammar includes
linguistic information and follows the traditional
writing system of Myanmar script.

<bodyText confidence="0.994644625">
Myanmar is a syllabic script and also one of the
languages which have complex orthographic
structures. Myanmar words are formed by
collection of syllables and each syllable may
contain up to seven different sub syllabic
elements. Again, each component group has its
own members having specific order.
Basically, Myanmar script has 33 consonants, 8
vowels (free standing and attached)1 , 2 diacritics,
11 medials, a vowel killer or ASAT, 10 digits
and 2 punctuation marks.
A Myanmar syllable consists of 7 different
components in Backus Normal Form (BNF) is as
follows.

And the notation [ ] means 0 or 1 occurrence and

only on basic and major five sub syllabic groups

ဠ } having 33 elements. But, the letter အ can act
as consonant as well as free standing vowel.
Medials or consonant conjuncts mean the
modifiers of the syllables` vowel and they are
encoded separately in the Unicode encoding.
There are four basic medials in Unicode chart
and it is represented as the set M={ , , }.
The set V of Myanmar attached vowel characters
in Unicode contains 8 elements { ါ, , , , ,
, , }. ( Peter and William, 1996)
Diacritics alter the vowel sounds of
accompanying consonants and they are used to
indicate tone level. There are 2 diacritical marks
{ , } in Myanmar script and the set is
represented as D.
The asat, or killer, representing the set K= { }
is a visibly displayed sign. In some cases it
indicates that the inherent vowel sound of a
consonant letter is suppressed. In other cases it
combines with other characters to form a vowel
letter. Regardless of its function, this visible sign
is always represented by the character U+103A .2
[John Okell, 1994]
In Unicode chart, the diacritics group D and the
vowel killer or ASAT “K” are included in the
group named various signs.

2.3 Combinations of Syllabic Components
within a Syllable
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994865">
As mentioned in the earlier sections, we choose
only 5 basic sub syllabic components namely
consonants (C), medial (M), attached vowels (V),
vowel killer (K) and diacritics (D) to describe
Myanmar syllable. As our intended use for
syllabification is for sorting, we omit stand-alone
vowels and digits in describing Myanmar
syllable structure. Further, according to the
sorting order of Myanmar Orthography, stand-
alone vowels are sorted as the syllable using the
above 5 sub syllabic elements having the same
pronunciation. For example, stand-alone vowel
“ဣ” is sorted as consonant “အ” and attached
vowel “ ” combination as “အ ”.
In Myanmar language, a syllable with only one
consonant can be taken as one syllable because
Myanmar script is Abugida which means all
letters have inherent vowel. And, consonants can
be followed by vowels, consonant, vowel killer
and medials in different combinations.
One special feature is that if there are two
consonants in a given syllable, the second
consonant must be followed by vowel killer (K).
We found that 1872 combinations of sub-syllabic
elements in Myanmar Orthography [Myanmar
Language Commission, 2006]. The table below
shows top level combinations of these sub-
syllabic elements.

In the above FSA, an interesting point is that
only one consonant can be a syllable because
Myanmar consonants have default vowel sounds.
That is why, state 2 can be a final state. For
instance, a Myanmar Word “o0, :o” (means
“Woman” in English) has two syllables. In the
first syllable “o0, :”, the sub syllabic elements are
Consonant(o) + Vowel(.-) +Consonant(,)+
Vowel Killer(S)+Diacritics(:..:). The second
syllable has only one consonant “o”.

Total number of productions/rules to recognize

found that the director symbol sets (which is also
known as first and follow sets) for same non-
terminal symbols with different productions are
disjoint.
This is the property of LL(1) grammar which
means for each non terminal that appears on the
left side of more than one production, the
directory symbol sets of all the productions in
which it appears on the left side are disjoint.
Therefore, our proposed grammar can be said as
LL(1) grammar.
The term LL1 is made up as follows. The first L
means reading from Left to right, the second L
means using Leftmost derivations, and the “1”
means with one symbol of lookahead. (Robin

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998593939394">
This study shows the powerfulness of
Chomsky`s context free grammar as it can apply
not only to describe the sentence structure but
also the syllable structure of an Asian script,
Myanmar. Though the number of productions in
the proposed grammar for Myanmar syllable is
large, the syntactic structure of a Myanmar
syllable is correctly recognized and the grammar
is not ambiguous.
Further, in parsing Myanmar syllable, it is
necessary to do preprocessing called contraction
for input sequences of vowels and consonant
conjuncts or medials to meet the requirements of
traditional writing systems. However, because of
these contracted forms, single lookahead symbol
in our proposed LL(1) grammar does not refer
exactly to one character and it may be a
Myanmar script is syllabic as well as
aggulutinative script. Every Myanmar word or
sentence is composed of series of individual
syllables. Thus, it is critical to have efficient way
of recognizing syllables in conformity with the
rules of Myanmar traditional writing system.
Our intended research is the automatic
syllabification of Myanmar polysyllabic words
using formal language theory.
One option to do is to modify our current CFG to
recognize consecutive syllables as a first step.
We found that if the current CFG is changed for
sequence of syllables, the grammar can be no
longer LL(1). Then, we need to use one of the
statistical methods, for example, probabilistic
CFG, to choose correct productions or best parse
for finding syllable boundaries.
Again, it is necessary to calculate the probability
values for each production based on the
frequency of occurrence of a syllable in a
dictionary we referred or using TreeBank.
We need Myanmar corpus or a tree bank which
contains evidence for rule expansions for syllable
structure and such a resource does not yet exist
for Myanmar. And also, the time and cost for
constructing a corpus by ourselves came into
consideration.
Another approach is to construct finite state
transducer for automatic syllabification of
Myanmar words. If we choose this approach, we
firstly need to construct regular grammar to
recognize Myanmar syllables. We already have
Myanmar syllable structure in regular grammar.
However, for finite state syllabification using
weights, there is a lack of resource for training
database.
We still have many language specific issues to be
addressed for implementing Myanmar script
using CFG or FSA. As a first issue, our current
grammar is based on five basic sub-syllabic
elements and thus developing the grammar
which can handle all seven Myanmar sub
syllabic elements will be future study.
Our current grammar is based on the code point
values of the input syllables or words. Then, as a
second issue, we need to consider about different
presentations or code point values of same
character. Moreover, we have special writing
traditions for some characters, for example, such
</bodyText>

as consonant stacking eg. de (Buddha), wA6No
(Mandalay, second capital of Myanmar),
consonant repetition eg. com c (University),
kinzi eg. aan6m (Cement), loan words eg.
c000(m) (bus). To represent such complex forms
in a computer system, we use invisible Virama
sign (U+1039). Therefore, it is necessary to
construct the productions which have conformity
with the stored character code sequence of
Myanmar Language.

Therefore, our proposed grammar can be said as LL(1) grammar. The term LL1 is made up as follows. The first L means reading from Left to right, the second L means using Leftmost derivations, and the “1” means with one symbol of lookahead.

Parse Table for Myanmar Syllable” 35 In the above table, the topmost row represents terminal symbols whereas the leftmost column represents the non terminal symbols. The entries in the table are productions to apply for each pair of non terminal and terminal. combination of two or more characters in parsing Myanma</context>
