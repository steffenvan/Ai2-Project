Approximately, 10,000 naturally occurring noun
phrases taken from the LOB corpus were used firstly, to
evaluate the NP component of the Alvey ANLT
grammar (Grover et al., 1987, 1989) and secondly, to
retest Sampson&apos;s (1987a) claim that this data provide
evidence for the lack of a clear-cut distinction between
grammatical and &apos;deviant&apos; examples. The examples were
sorted and classified on the basis of the lexical and
syntactic analysis undertaken as part of the LOB corpus
project (Sampson, 1987b). Tokens of each resulting type
were parsed using the ANLT grammar and the results
analysed to determine the success rate of the parses and
the generality of the rules employed.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper, we present the results of an analysis of
just over 10,000 English noun phrases (NPs) extracted
from the Lancaster Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus treebank
(Sampson, 1987b), a syntactically analysed 50,000 word
subset of the 1 million word LOB corpus. The
motivation for this research is twofold. Firstly, we wish
to use this substantial data-base of naturally occurring
constructions to test the accuracy and adequacy of a
(purportedly) wide-coverage sentence grammar (Grover
et al., 1987, 1989) which has been developed over the
past three years as part of a general-purpose
morphological and syntactic analyser for English
(hereafter the Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT)
grammar).2 The research reported here forms part of an
ongoing project to evaluate the complete grammar using
data extracted from the LOB corpus (see Briscoe et al.,
1987a). Secondly, Sampson (1987a) has analysed a large
subset of the same NPs and argued that they provide
evidence against any clear-cut distinction between
grammatical and &apos;deviant&apos; sentences in natural language.
Sampson suggests that the lack of such a distinction
precludes the possibility of successful automated natural
language processing (NLP) using a generative grammar.
If correct, this conclusion would have profound
implications for our own work and the majority of other
work in NLP (since the ANLT grammar is a type of
generative grammar). Therefore, we wished to assess the
evidence which Sampson uses to support his conclusion.
The LOB treebank is a manually analysed set of
sentences drawn from the lexically analysed and tagged
LOB corpus.3 An analysis consists of a labelled
bracketing containing lexical syntactic tags and phrasal
or clausal &apos;hypertags&apos;. Sampson (1987a:221) reports that
there are 47 tags and hypertags relevant to the analysis
of NPs — 28 lexical tags, 14 hypertags and 5 punctuation
tags. Analyses are assigned to sentences according to the
intuitions of the linguist guided by a &apos;casebook&apos; of
precedents (Sampson, 1987b). One important feature of
these analyses is that the resulting tree structures are
quite &apos;shallow&apos; in the sense that there are rarely
intervening nodes between the topmost node marked NP
and the lexical tags themselves. Whilst most NP
postmodifiers are treated as independent constituents, NP
premodifiers are largely analysed as immediate daughters
of the topmost NP node. In addition, punctuation tags
are usually attached as immediate daughters of this node.
A second significant feature of the LOB treebank
analysis scheme is that tags and hypertags are atomic
symbols (albeit with mnemonic names designed to
indicate aspects of their featural composition).
Sampson (1987a:221) treats these 47 tags and
hypertags as defining the types of distinct NP: &amp;quot;two or
more noun phrases are regarded as tokens of the same
type if their respective immediate constituents (ICs)
represent the same sequence of possibilities drawn from
this 47-member set of constituent-types&amp;quot;. The example
he gives of an NP type is DT* *S , F which would be
the analysis assigned to an NP consisting of a
determiner, plural noun, comma and finite clause. In this
example, Sampson has generalised across sets of atomic
tags through the use of `wildcard&apos; symbols, so DT*
generalises across DTI, DT$, DTS, DTX, and so forth.
He does not explain the extent to which he has
generalised types in this fashion; however, since
(hyper)tags contain at most four letters representing
distinct features there are strict limits on featural
decomposition within this framework of analysis.
Sampson found that the 8328 NP tokens in his sample
fell into 747 distinct NP types (relative to the notion of
type just described). However, the crucial point of his
argument is that the distribution of tokens amongst types
is very wide. Sampson finds that there are a few very
common types (such as 1135 tokens of DT* N* ie.
determiner followed by noun) and a large number of
distinct types with very few tokens (such as 468 types
represented by a single token). Sampson examines the
shape of the constituent type/token curve which results
from analysing each type frequency relative to the most
frequent type in the corpus. Sampson (1987a:225)
concludes that this analysis provides &amp;quot;no evidence at all
of a two-way partition of noun phrase types into a group
of high-frequency, well-formed constructions and a group
of unique or rare &apos;deviant&apos; constructions; instead noun
phrase types in the sample appear to be scattered
continuously across the frequency spectrum.&amp;quot;
Furthermore, he suggests that the evidence from NPs
supports his claim that &amp;quot;the range of constructions
occurring in authentic texts seems so endlessly diverse
- 256 -
that the enterprise of formulating watertight generative
grammars appears doomed to failure&amp;quot; (1987b:219).
The last step in Sampson&apos;s argument from the
distribution of tokens amongst NP types to the failure of
the generative paradigm is not made completely explicit.
However, we believe that a legitimate way of
reconstructing it is as follows. Suppose that we convert
each NP type as defined above into a phrase-structure
rule of a generative grammar (so DT* *S , F becomes
NP —&gt; DT* *S , F and so forth). Now consider the form
that such a grammar will take: there will be a small
number of quite general rules which will be used
frequently and a very large number of particular rules
used very infrequently. Crucially, for any corpus
considered, many of the particular rules will be
motivated by just one token in the data. Thus, these rules
are not rules in any genuine sense since they express no
generalisations over the data. Furthermore, this suggests
that the task of the generative linguist (in search of
watertight grammars) will never be complete because
each new set of data will bring with it the need for
further highly idiosyncratic &apos;rules&apos; of this kind.
Whilst it seems likely that &amp;quot;all grammars leak&amp;quot;
slightly, one clear problem with Sampson&apos;s argument is
that his evidence only bears on one particular and
implausible generative grammar, rather than on the
paradigm as a whole. It may well be that the
generalisations which can be expressed in terms of a
phrase-structure grammar employing a finite set of
(nearly) atomic categories are not those appropriate to
elegant description of natural language syntax (Chomslcy,
1957; Gazdar et al., 1985). In addition, the strategy of
adopting &apos;shallow&apos; analyses in which each phrase-
structure rule will have many daughter categories will
tend to reduce the applicability of each rule. In these
respects, the ANLT grammar is a more conventional
generative grammar, based on recent monostratal
approaches to syntactic description. Syntactic categories
are feature complexes and unification is employed as the
method of grammatical combination. Syntactic
generalisations are expressed in tenns of partially
specified immediate dominance rules, linear precedence
rules and a variety of metagrammatical statements
concerning feature defaults, propagation, optional
pre/postmodification, and so forth.&apos; In addition, the
particular analysis of NPs adopted recognises a number
of intermediate nominal categories (such as N-bar), as
well as recursion within these categories, and this
ensures that most individual rules mention fewer
daughters than would be typical in the analysis used in
the description of the LOB treebank. For these reasons,
we felt that a fairer test of Sampson&apos;s claims would be
to evaluate the same corpus of NPs with respect to the
ANLT grammar. In addition, this excercise would
provide valuable information concerning the real
adequacy of the account of English NPs incorporated
into this grammar.

THE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997455141791045">
A superset of the corpus of data analysed by
Sampson (1987a) was extracted from the LOB treebank
using tree searching software developed by the first
author and Roger Garside of Lancaster University&apos;s
computing department. Following Sampson, we ignored
categories G (Belles lettres, biography, essays) and P
(Romance and love story) from the treebank data-base.
The omission of this treebank data merely reflects the
state of development of the treebank at the time when
Sampson undertook his experiment. However, Sampson
also ignored coordination because he felt that coor-
dination reduction and such phenomena would create
&amp;quot;special complications&amp;quot;. We include results for the
coordinated examples because the ANLT grammar
contains the required rules. In other respects, the initial
samples are identical; both being drawn from an identical
38,212 word sample from the treebank.
Of the 10,150 NPs in this sample of the treebank, 17
were rejected because they were incorrectly analysed and
either were not, in fact, NPs or else the boundaries of
the putative NP were incorrectly marked and, therefore,
our access software failed. The remaining 10,133 NPs
were initially sorted into single and multi constituent
NPs (according to the LOB model of analysis). Single
constituent NPs were further sorted according to the
incidence and order of their immediate lexical con-
stituents and multi constituent NPs according to the
incidence, order and attachment of their immediate
daughters. At this point, we discarded a further 119 NPs
which were tagged in a way which indicated they
contained either foreign phrases (for example, fait
accompli) or mathematical formulae and symbols. These
are tagged but not analysed internally in the treebank.
We assume that they are irrelevant to the syntax of
English NPs. These steps resulted in 10,014 NPs being
sorted into 2358 distinct NP types. These types must be
identical with Sampson&apos;s initial analysis (modulo the
inclusion of coordination and exclusion of formulae and
foreign phrases) because they are based entirely on the
literal form of the tags in the LOB treebank.
The next stage of our analysis was to semi-
automatically reduce these 2358 NP types into fewer
types by collapsing together tags on the basis of gram-
matical generalisations exploited in the ANLT grammar
rules and implicit in the LOB tag names. For example,
there is no purpose in treating NPs identical apart from
the number of the head noun as distinct (although they
are tagged distinctly) because the ANLT grammar will
deploy precisely the same set of rules to analyse them.
Sampson (1987a) also collapsed types by generalising
across tags, however, he gives no details of this pro-
cedure, so it is impossible to quantify the extent to
which our analyses diverged at this point. Following
Sampson, we ignored the internal structure of post-
modifiers (such as PPs, relative clauses, etc.) and of
possessive premodifiers. However, in order not to
trivialise the experiment we analysed the same set of
lexical data covered by his analysis regardless of
whether lexical items are treated as immediate
constituents of NP in the ANLT grammar. For example,
- 257 -
sequences of simple adjectival or possessive premodifiers
are directly attached to the topmost NP node in the
treebank, so we consider these cases in our results.
need for automatic semantic &apos;filtering&apos; of the parses
produced, but, in the absence of a fairly comprehensive
and sophisticated lexical and compositional semantic
component, this was not possible.
We also performed some manual editing of the LOB
examples to remove punctuation. The ANLT grammar
contains no rules referring to punctuation since we do
not regard punctuation as a syntactic phenomenon.
However, where punctuation reflects a genuine syntactic
distinction (such as that between restrictive and non-
restrictive postmodification), examples were classified
appropriately. This approach probably gives us a slight
edge over Sampson in terms of the generalising power of
our rules, but we do not regard this as pernicious
because we do not recognise a syntactic difference bet-
ween examples such as the man with red shoes in the
park and the man with red shoes, in the park, given the
semantically intuitive analysis. 48 NPs contained bra-
ckets, of which 34 signalled appositional or paren-
thetical material. The appositional cases were parsed with
brackets deleted. The parenthetical cases were counted as
failures (see below for further discussion). In 8 of the
remaining cases, the brackets were internal to an em-
bedded constituent and were, therefore, irrelevant 3
further examples contained point numbering or marking
(i.e. a)... b)...) conventions and the final 3 enclosed
ordinary modifiers. These 6 examples were parsed with
brackets and numbering/marking conventions removed.
These steps resulted in 707 distinct NP types.
Sampson (1987a) found 747 types. When one considers
that punctuation will have increased the number of types
he found, it seems likely that we have probably
reanalysed the data in a manner quite similar to his
original analysis. One token of each of the 707 revised
types of NP was parsed using the ANLT grammar NP
rules. Initially, we attempted to perform this analysis
automatically using the ANLT project parser in batch
mode. The words in the example to be parsed were
replaced with their lexical tags and a &apos;lexicon&apos; was
created relating tags to lexical syntactic categories in the
ANLT grammar. Data from the treebank and other data
from two different corpora were parsed in this fashion
and the output was manually analysed to select the
semantically correct analysis, weed out &apos;false positives&apos;
where the system had assigned one or more incorrect
analyses, and to diagnose the reasons for parse failure.
Failures occurred both because of inadequacies in
grammatical coverage and because of resource limitations
with some long and multiply-ambiguous NPs. The
resulting data contained many cases of multiple analyses
of the type expected using a grammar containing rules to
handle PP attachment and compounding (see, for ex-
ample, Church &amp; Patil, 1982). The intention was to com-
pute the frequency with which each rule of the grammar
applied and the overall success rate of the gram-
mar/parser from these manually edited files. However,
the process of evaluating and searching for correct
analyses amongst very high numbers of automatically
generated parses required more effort than manually
applying the rules to check that the semantically correct
analysis could be produced. This problem highlights the
Therefore, we completed the analysis of one token
of each of the 707 NP types by manually applying the
ANLT grammar to check that the semantically
appropriate analysis could be produced. When the correct
parse was available, the rules used in this analysis were
recorded. We derived a numerical index of the generality
of each rule by counting each application and
multiplying it by the number of tokens in each type
exemplified by the parsed example.

622 of the 707 examples were parsed successfully,
yielding a success rate of 87.97% When the success rate
takes account of the frequency of each NP type in the
sample and indicates the proportion of successful NF
parses which would be achieved by the ANLT system
for this data, the figure rises to 96.88% or 9702 NPs
parsed successfully out of the 10,014 sample.
The analyses utilised a total of 54 distinct rules
expressed in the ANLT &apos;object grammar&apos; formalism. 01
these 8 were additions prompted by the experiment: 3
for names (Mr. Joe Bloggs), 1 for noun compounding
(water meter), 2 for adverbial pre- and post-modificatior
(nearly a century), 1 for possessive NPs dominated by
N-bar (the America&apos;s cup), and 1 for NPs with adjectival
heads (the poor). We added these rules because they
express uncontroversial generalisations and represeni
&apos;oversights&apos; in the development of the grammar rathei
than ad hoc additions solely for the purposes of the
experiment.
These object grammar rules were produced by 1
linear precedence statements, 4 rules of feature prop-
agation, 6 feature default rules, 3 metarules, and 50 im.

rule application will be associated with the objeci

We counted the number of times each of the 54
object grammar phrase-structure rules would apply in the
analysis of all the parsable examples in the sample. The

There are a number of reasons why some of these
figures are slightly misleading. For example, some low
numbers are an artifact of the preliminary analysis into
types. Thus, N2+/PRO(FOOT9), which would be utilised
to parse NPs consisting of wh-pronouns, such as who,
what, and so forth, only applies once. In the preliminary
analysis, we decided to collapse together tags for the wh
and non-wh version of the same category. It is just an
accident that in all of the representative tokens of each
type which were parsed, only one wh-pronoun turned up
and this happened to represent a singleton type.
Similarly, Nl/SFIN only applies twice, but it is probable
that there are more examples of nouns taking sentential
complements as arguments in the sample. The LOB
tagset represents these complements by &apos;Fn&apos; and relative
clauses by &apos;Fr&apos;. Following Sampson, we collapsed all of
these to &apos;F&apos;. Consequently, the bulk of the sentential
complements were incorrectly added to the types
involving postrnodification by relative clauses. These
problems are unavoidable, given the particular
assumptions built into the LOB treebank analyses, unless
a completely new analysis of the sample was undertaken.
One way of ameliorating this problem is to collapse
some of the distinct rules in Table 1. A number of the
distinct object grammar rules are present for &apos;technical&apos;
reasons connected with the use of fixed-arity unification
and feature propagation by variable binding in the ANLT
grammar formalism and parser (see Briscoe et al.,
1987b,c for details). Therefore, we reduced the 54 object
grammar rules to 36 hypothetical rules using our
judgement to determine whether a distinction between
rules was motivated by a linguistic generalisation or a
technical consideration peculiar to the ANLT grammar
formalism. In most cases, the linguistic generalisation is,
in fact, present in the metagranunar rules but &apos;compiled
out&apos; in the automatic production of the equivalent object
grammar. For example, rules with &apos;FOOT&apos; in their name
are wh-variants of other rules defined by metarules
which state the manner in which they differ
(systematically) from the non-wh versions. The resulting
36 hypothetical rules are given in Table 2 along with
new rule application counts based on summing the
counts for the merged actual rules. We also give the
figures for the number of times each rule applied in the
parsing of one token of each type. The final column
presents a &apos;proportioned-up&apos; figure based on multiplying
the second column by 15.6 (since the parsed tokens
represent 6.41% of the total sample). This column gives
another perspective on the &apos;generalising power&apos; of the
rules involved.

We suggested above that Sampson&apos;s argument

747 types of which 468 were singleton types containing
only one token, or 62.65% singleton types. In our

tokens, ours contained 1519 tokens. Sampson (1987a)
presents an analysis of his data which involves plotting a
frequency-ordered list of NP types against the cumulative
frequency of NP tokens in types of the same or lower
frequency. This allows him to predict that &apos;rare&apos; types,
defined in terms of rate of occurrence relative to the rate
of occurrence of the commonest type, will crop up fairly
often in naturally occurring samples of NPs. For ins-
tance, if &apos;rare&apos; is defined as occurring no more than once
per 1000 occurrences of the commonest type, then about
one example in 16 will represent some rare type.
Therefore, a robust parser will need many &apos;rules&apos; for
such &apos;rare&apos; types. Furthermore, there is no reason to
expect the percentage of singleton types to fall as the
sample size grows, implying that a robust parser of
unrestricted text deploying a finite set of generative rules
is out of the question.
Unfortunately, we cannot repeat Sampson&apos;s analysis
for both our types and our rules because more than one
rule is involved in the parsing of many of the types.
Using the ANLT NP rules, an average of 5 rules applied
- 260 -
to each parsed token exemplifying a type, this figure
drops to 3.18 when we take the average for the complete
sample. Therefore, there is no direct correlation between
rules and types. Nevertheless, Sampson&apos;s result follows
directly from the high proportion of singleton types in
his analysis and his assumption that one rule will suffice
for each type; as he writes &amp;quot;although a rare type is by
definition represented by fewer tokens in a sample than a
common type, as we move to lower type-frequencies the
number of types possessing those frequencies grows,
so that the total proportion of tokens representing all
&amp;quot;rare&amp;quot; types remains significantly large even when the
threshold of &amp;quot;rarity&amp;quot; is set at relatively extreme values.&amp;quot;
(Sampson, 1987:225, original emphasis).
The most basic and important difference between
any grammar based on a one-to-one correspondence of
rules and types and one such as the ANLT grammar is
the enormous difference in its size; namely, 36 or 54
rules as opposed to 707 or 747 rules — reduction by a
fac-tor between 13 and 20 approximately. This alone
testifies to the greater generality of the ANLT NP
grammar rules. However, there are also big differences
in the patterns of application of rules between the two
approaches. We can see this by looking at an ordered list
of the rarest 10 types and comparing it with similar lists
for the least applied actual and hypothetical 10 ANLT
rules. The first column in Table 3 shows the number of
tokens or rule applications. Following columns show
numbers and percentages of types or rules associated
with this number of tokens or applications.

Summing the percentage values reveals that 88.92% of
tokens fell into the ten rarest types, 38.89% of actual
rules fell into the ten least applied classes, and 33.33%
of hypothetical rules fell into the ten least applied classes
for that set. Table 3 further demonstrates the greater
generality of the rule-based analysis versus the type-
based analysis for this sample of NPs. But in a sense,
presenting the results in this manner misses the crux of
Sampson&apos;s argument that any parsing system based on
generative rules will need a large or open-ended set of
spurious &apos;rules&apos; which simply redescribe the data,
because they will only apply once. In the actual rule set,
6 rules or 11.11% are dubious in this sense, but, as we
argued above, these rules are only distinct for technical
reasons and in the hypothetical set no such rules exist. In
any case, the proportion of actual dubious rules
represents a considerable improvement on the proportion
of singleton types (59.55%).
In (1) we present 3 (randomly-chosen) tokens of
NPs from singleton types. If Sampson&apos;s general thesis
were correct, we would expect such examples to be
exotic or syntactically mysterious.

<bodyText confidence="0.97309445">
These NPs are not problematic for the ANLT grammar
and are classified as singleton types because of the
nature of the lexical and syntactic analysis used in the
LOB treebank. Similarly, ANLT rules which applied
&apos;rarely&apos;, such as Nl/VPINF (6 times) or Nl/INFMOD (2
times), which would apply in the parsing of desire to
grow up and man to ask respectively, do not encode
controversial or doubtful generalisations. Although the
actual frequency of such constructions in English may
well be low.
THE FAILURES
It is instructive for similar reasons to examine those
examples that the ANLT grammar failed to parse. If
Sampson&apos;s general thesis were correct, we should expect
these to fall into singleton types and be syntactically
exotic or mysterious. In fact, they are relatively easy to
classify and the failure of the ANLT grammar results
from either intentional or in some cases unintentional
&apos;oversights&apos; in the NP grammar. The failures can be
classified, as illustrated in Table 4.

Odd numbers include examples like 2 Kings 25 : 25 , 6,
and so forth. No rule was included in the grammar for
dates, although these all consist of day (written 10 or
10th), month (unabbreviated), and year (in numerals). In
2 of the 4 cases the order of day and month is reversed.
Ellipsis of the head noun in cases where there is a
postmodifier, for example, those who perpetuate it,
causes a problem for the ANLT grammar because the
determiner those cannot be analysed as a pronoun since
- 261 -
the grammar blocks modification of pronouns. This
problem accounts for all the failures in this class.
Parenthetical or intrusive material which is not in
apposition comes in two kinds. Firstly, there are cases of
grammatical modification which occurs between the head
noun and its arguments, as (2) illustrates.
(2) our failure over two centuries to sustain any strong
national musical tradition of our own
These are not parsed as a result of the rigid assumptions
about the ordering of arguments and modifiers built into
the grammar. These need to be relaxed on the basis of
some theory of &apos;heaviness&apos; and its effect on order.
Secondly, there are cases of genuine intrusive interjection
or interpolation, as (3) illustrates.
(3) little capsules , this big , — he brandished a
teaspoon — with hundreds of tiny little red men inside
them
Such intrusive material can occur in most positions from
a syntactic perspective. We suspect that a theory
concerning their distribution would be largely pragmatic.
Some cases of `right-node raising&apos; of phrases are
covered by the ANLT grammar. However, there is no
rule for &apos;right-node raising&apos; of nouns which would
appear to be needed in NPs such as late 19th- and early
20th-century Rumania. Similarly, the grammar restricts
NP premodifiers to AP, but a number of non-AP
premodifiers occurred in the sample. These mostly
involved measure phrases of some form, such as a 6 p.c
tax free distribution, the 24ft passenger cabin, or the 5
shilling shares. There are 4 cases of unlike category
coordination in AP modifiers like music , both
manuscript and printed and wine-glass or flared heels.
The ANLT grammar allows this in post-copular position,
but clearly the relevant generalisations should be
extended to AP pre- and post-modifiers.
There are a number of cases where a premodifier
selects a particular postmodifier. Comparative constru-
ctions with more and than are a well-known type which
the ANLT grammar covers. However, there are many
other more or less idiomatic phrases of this type, some
of which could probably be subsumed by an expanded
treatment of comparatives along existing lines, some of
which could not. We give illustrative examples in (4).

as much God&apos;s handiwork as a man
as little as 0.001 at % of the addition elements
In addition, the rule for noun compounding we have
included does not allow compounds to contain anything
other than lexical nouns. Cases of adjectives in
compounds were treated as &apos;successes&apos; by allowing the
rule N/ADJ which converts adjectives such as poor to
nouns to deal with ellipsis of the head noun in the poor
to overapply to adjectives in compounds. In this area, the
ANLT grammar is clearly inadequate and needs
improvement in obvious directions. The rule N/ADJ
should be replaced by a lexical rule which states that
&apos;+human&apos; adjectives can function as nouns, and
compounding rules should be allowed to cross the
&apos;boundary&apos; between morphology and syntax, perhaps by
allowing N-bar categories as well as nouns to
&apos;compound&apos;. These modifications would allow the
illustrative examples in (5) to be counted as successes.

The miscellaneous class contains 2 types where each
occurs at the NP boundary, such as silicon, copper and
magnesium each. We suspect that in these examples
each should be treated as an adverbial modifier of the
following VP. There are two types containing the phrase
all but as part of a partitive, some cases of words, such
as no one occurring unhyphened, and one or two more
exotic examples illustrated in (6).

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997475513888889">
Our results demonstrate quite clearly that a feature-
based unification grammar employing a recursive and
&apos;deeper&apos; style of analysis captures the relevant gener-
alisations more efficiently than the analysis and implicit
formalism employed by Sampson (1987a). We have
reduced approximately 700 types to between 36 or 54
grammatical generalisations about NPs and shown that a
minimally modified generative grammar developed
(largely) independently of the test corpus is capable of
covering 96.88% of the sample considered. We can
demonstrate concretely why this should be so by
considering the distinct single-constituent NP types from
the treebank data exemplified by DT* JJ N*, DT* JJ JJ
N*, and so forth. In the ANLT grammar this potentially
infinite set of types is analysed through the recursive
application of four rules of the following broad type: NP
—&gt; DET N1, N1 —&gt; AP N1, AP —&gt; A, N1 —&gt; N. Thus a
potentially infinite set of NP types is reduced to 4
grammatical generalisations.
We do not wish to claim that we have developed a
&apos;watertight&apos; perfect grammar of the English NP (although
we do feel that the ANLT grammar has withstood this
evaluation very well). There is still the 3.12% or 312
NPs that we are unable, at present, to analyse, and there
is good reason to believe that &amp;quot;all grammars leak&amp;quot;
slightly. However, there is little evidence in our results
to suggest that a few rule-governed grammatical
generalisations about naturally occurring NPs of English
- 262 -
do not effectively demarcate grammatical examples; or to
suggest that the enterprise of generative grammar is
doomed because of the high proportion of rules required
to deal with residual, particular cases. On the contrary,
our analysis of the failures demonstrates that, for the
most part, they are not parsed because of oversights in
the ANLT grammar, rather than because they are deviant
in syntactically mysterious ways.
Sampson (1987a:226) concludes that the &amp;quot;onus must
surely be on those who believe in the possibility of NL
analysis by means of comprehensive generative
grammars to explain why they suppose that the shape of
constituent type/token distribution curves will be
markedly different from the shallow straight line
suggested by our limited - but not insignificant -
database.&amp;quot; However, Sampson&apos;s result is suggested by
his analysis of this data, not the data itself. In this paper,
we have demonstrated that a more satisfactory analysis
of essentially the same data-base leads to precisely the
opposite conclusion.
In other respects, the conclusions we should draw
from this experiment are less positive. The development
of wide-coverage grammars for robust parsing of
unrestricted text will only be achieved through extensive
evaluation using naturally occurring data. This, in turn,
rests on the availability of suitably structured corpora
from which the relevant data can be extracted
automatically and on suitable software for semi-
automatically testing rules against this data. The ANLT
batch-mode parsing system proved completely inadequate
to the latter task (largely because it was developed to
check the grammar against a hand constructed set of
short illustrative, deliberately unambiguous examples).
Sampson (1987a) was able to perform a more
sophisticated analysis of the treebank sample precisely
because the original structuring of the data corresponded
to his &apos;theory of grammar and grammatical analysis&apos;.
The problems we have had making use of his analysis to
preliminarily classify the same data in order to evaluate
the ANLT NP grammar highlight the impossibility of
developing a corpus databank structured in some
grammatically &apos;descriptive&apos; or &apos;uncontroversial&apos; fashion
(pace Sampson, 1987b).

Sampson suggests that the lack of such a distinction precludes the possibility of successful automated natural language processing (NLP) using a generative grammar. If correct, this conclusion would have profound implications for our own work and the majority of other work in NLP (since the ANLT grammar is a type of generative grammar). Therefore, we wished to assess the evidence which </context>

These problems are unavoidable, given the particular assumptions built into the LOB treebank analyses, unless a completely new analysis of the sample was undertaken. One way of ameliorating this problem is to collapse some of the distinct rules in Table 1. A number of the distinct object grammar rules are present for &apos;technical&apos; reasons connected with the use of fixed-arity unification and feature propagation by variable binding in the ANLT grammar formalism and parser (see Briscoe et al., 1987b,c for details). Therefore, we reduced the 54 object grammar rules to 36 hypothetical rules using our judgement to determine whether a distinction between rules was motivated by a linguistic generalisation or a technical consideration peculiar to the ANLT grammar formalism. In most cases, the linguistic generalisation is, in fact, present in the metagranunar rules but &apos;compiled out&apos; in the automatic production of the equivalent object grammar. For example, rules with &apos;FOOT&apos; in their name are wh-variants of other rules defined by metarules which state the manner in which they differ (systemati</context>

Whilst it seems likely that &amp;quot;all grammars leak&amp;quot; slightly, one clear problem with Sampson&apos;s argument is that his evidence only bears on one particular and implausible generative grammar, rather than on the paradigm as a whole. It may well be that the generalisations which can be expressed in terms of a phrase-structure grammar employing a finite set of (nearly) atomic categories are not those appropriate to elegant description of natural language syntax (Chomslcy, 1957; Gazdar et al., 1985). In addition, the strategy of adopting &apos;shallow&apos; analyses in which each phrasestructure rule will have many daughter categories will tend to reduce the applicability of each rule. In these respects, the ANLT grammar is a more conventional generative grammar, based on recent monostratal approaches to syntactic description. Syntactic categories are feature complexes and unification is employed as the method of grammatical combination. Syntactic generalisations are expressed in tenns of partially specified immediate dominance rules, linear precedence rules and a variety of metagrammatical statem</context>

ABSTRACT Approximately, 10,000 naturally occurring noun phrases taken from the LOB corpus were used firstly, to evaluate the NP component of the Alvey ANLT grammar (Grover et al., 1987, 1989) and secondly, to retest Sampson&apos;s (1987a) claim that this data provide evidence for the lack of a clear-cut distinction between grammatical and &apos;deviant&apos; examples. The examples were sorted and classified on the basis of the lexical and syntactic analysis undertaken as part of the LOB corpus project (Sampson, 1987b). Tokens of each resulting type were parsed using the ANLT grammar and the results analysed to determine the success rate of the parses and the generality of the rules employed. INTRODUCTION In this paper, we present the results of an analysis of just over 10,000 English noun phrases (NPs) extracted from the Lancaster Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus treebank (Sampson, 1987b), a syntactically analysed 50,000 word subset of the 1 million word LOB corpus.

If correct, this conclusion would have profound implications for our own work and the majority of other work in NLP (since the ANLT grammar is a type of generative grammar). Therefore, we wished to assess the evidence which Sampson uses to support his conclusion. The LOB treebank is a manually analysed set of sentences drawn from the lexically analysed and tagged LOB corpus.3 An analysis consists of a labelled bracketing containing lexical syntactic tags and phrasal or clausal &apos;hypertags&apos;. Sampson (1987a:221) reports that there are 47 tags and hypertags relevant to the analysis of NPs — 28 lexical tags, 14 hypertags and 5 punctuation tags. Analyses are assigned to sentences according to the intuitions of the linguist guided by a &apos;casebook&apos; of precedents (Sampson, 1987b). One important feature of these analyses is that the resulting tree structures are quite &apos;shallow&apos; in the sense that there are rarely intervening nodes between the topmost node marked NP and the lexical tags themselves. Whilst most NP postmodifiers are treated as independent constituents, NP premodifiers are largely analysed </context>
<context position="5070" citStr="Sampson (1987" startWordPosition="798" endWordPosition="799"> NP tokens in his sample fell into 747 distinct NP types (relative to the notion of type just described). However, the crucial point of his argument is that the distribution of tokens amongst types is very wide. Sampson finds that there are a few very common types (such as 1135 tokens of DT* N* ie. determiner followed by noun) and a large number of distinct types with very few tokens (such as 468 types represented by a single token). Sampson examines the shape of the constituent type/token curve which results from analysing each type frequency relative to the most frequent type in the corpus. Sampson (1987a:225) concludes that this analysis provides &amp;quot;no evidence at all of a two-way partition of noun phrase types into a group of high-frequency, well-formed constructions and a group of unique or rare &apos;deviant&apos; constructions; instead noun phrase types in the sample appear to be scattered continuously across the frequency spectrum.&amp;quot; Furthermore, he suggests that the evidence from NPs supports his claim that &amp;quot;the range of constructions occurring in authentic texts seems so endlessly diverse - 256 - that the enterprise of formulating watertight generative grammars appears doomed to failure&amp;quot; (1987b:21</context>
<context position="8624" citStr="Sampson (1987" startWordPosition="1356" endWordPosition="1357"> nominal categories (such as N-bar), as well as recursion within these categories, and this ensures that most individual rules mention fewer daughters than would be typical in the analysis used in the description of the LOB treebank. For these reasons, we felt that a fairer test of Sampson&apos;s claims would be to evaluate the same corpus of NPs with respect to the ANLT grammar. In addition, this excercise would provide valuable information concerning the real adequacy of the account of English NPs incorporated into this grammar. THE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE A superset of the corpus of data analysed by Sampson (1987a) was extracted from the LOB treebank using tree searching software developed by the first author and Roger Garside of Lancaster University&apos;s computing department. Following Sampson, we ignored categories G (Belles lettres, biography, essays) and P (Romance and love story) from the treebank data-base. The omission of this treebank data merely reflects the state of development of the treebank at the time when Sampson undertook his experiment. However, Sampson also ignored coordination because he felt that coordination reduction and such phenomena would create &amp;quot;special complications&amp;quot;. We includ</context>
<context position="11166" citStr="Sampson (1987" startWordPosition="1758" endWordPosition="1759">sion of formulae and foreign phrases) because they are based entirely on the literal form of the tags in the LOB treebank. The next stage of our analysis was to semiautomatically reduce these 2358 NP types into fewer types by collapsing together tags on the basis of grammatical generalisations exploited in the ANLT grammar rules and implicit in the LOB tag names. For example, there is no purpose in treating NPs identical apart from the number of the head noun as distinct (although they are tagged distinctly) because the ANLT grammar will deploy precisely the same set of rules to analyse them. Sampson (1987a) also collapsed types by generalising across tags, however, he gives no details of this procedure, so it is impossible to quantify the extent to which our analyses diverged at this point. Following Sampson, we ignored the internal structure of postmodifiers (such as PPs, relative clauses, etc.) and of possessive premodifiers. However, in order not to trivialise the experiment we analysed the same set of lexical data covered by his analysis regardless of whether lexical items are treated as immediate constituents of NP in the ANLT grammar. For example, - 257 - sequences of simple adjectival o</context>
<context position="13445" citStr="Sampson (1987" startWordPosition="2113" endWordPosition="2114">ined brackets, of which 34 signalled appositional or parenthetical material. The appositional cases were parsed with brackets deleted. The parenthetical cases were counted as failures (see below for further discussion). In 8 of the remaining cases, the brackets were internal to an embedded constituent and were, therefore, irrelevant 3 further examples contained point numbering or marking (i.e. a)... b)...) conventions and the final 3 enclosed ordinary modifiers. These 6 examples were parsed with brackets and numbering/marking conventions removed. These steps resulted in 707 distinct NP types. Sampson (1987a) found 747 types. When one considers that punctuation will have increased the number of types he found, it seems likely that we have probably reanalysed the data in a manner quite similar to his original analysis. One token of each of the 707 revised types of NP was parsed using the ANLT grammar NP rules. Initially, we attempted to perform this analysis automatically using the ANLT project parser in batch mode. The words in the example to be parsed were replaced with their lexical tags and a &apos;lexicon&apos; was created relating tags to lexical syntactic categories in the ANLT grammar.

Sampson&apos;s commonest type contained 1135 tokens, ours contained 1519 tokens. Sampson (1987a) presents an analysis of his data which involves plotting a frequency-ordered list of NP types against the cumulative frequency of NP tokens in types of the same or lower frequency. This allows him to predict that &apos;rare&apos; types, defined in terms of rate of occurrence relative to the rate of occurrence of the commonest type, will crop up fairly often in naturally occurring samples of NPs. For instance, if &apos;rare&apos; is defined as occurring no more than once per 1000 occurrences of the commonest type, then about one example in 16 will represent some rare type. Therefore, a robust parser will need m</context>
<context position="26338" citStr="Sampson, 1987" startWordPosition="4243" endWordPosition="4244">ere is no direct correlation between rules and types. Nevertheless, Sampson&apos;s result follows directly from the high proportion of singleton types in his analysis and his assumption that one rule will suffice for each type; as he writes &amp;quot;although a rare type is by definition represented by fewer tokens in a sample than a common type, as we move to lower type-frequencies the number of types possessing those frequencies grows, so that the total proportion of tokens representing all &amp;quot;rare&amp;quot; types remains significantly large even when the threshold of &amp;quot;rarity&amp;quot; is set at relatively extreme values.&amp;quot; (Sampson, 1987:225, original emphasis). The most basic and important difference between any grammar based on a one-to-one correspondence of rules and types and one such as the ANLT grammar is the enormous difference in its size; namely, 36 or 54 rules as opposed to 707 or 747 rules — reduction by a fac-tor between 13 and 20 approximately. This alone testifies to the greater generality of the ANLT NP grammar rules. However, there are also big differences in the patterns of application of rules between the two approaches. We can see this by looking at an ordered list of the rarest 10 types and comparing it wi</context>

(7) the company&apos;s Caravelle schedules London-Brussels and onwards from Athens to various points... This could be classified as a case of non-constituent coordination of NP and PP postnominally or as a case of specialised ellipsis of from before London in &apos;travelagent-speak&apos;. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate quite clearly that a featurebased unification grammar employing a recursive and &apos;deeper&apos; style of analysis captures the relevant generalisations more efficiently than the analysis and implicit formalism employed by Sampson (1987a). We have reduced approximately 700 types to between 36 or 54 grammatical generalisations about NPs and shown that a minimally modified generative grammar developed (largely) independently of the test corpus is capable of covering 96.88% of the sample considered. We can demonstrate concretely why this should be so by considering the distinct single-constituent NP types from the treebank data exemplified by DT* JJ N*, DT* JJ JJ N*, and so forth. In the ANLT grammar this potentially infinite set of types is analysed through the recursive application of four rules of the following broad type: N</context>
<context position="36741" citStr="Sampson (1987" startWordPosition="6015" endWordPosition="6016">k&amp;quot; slightly. However, there is little evidence in our results to suggest that a few rule-governed grammatical generalisations about naturally occurring NPs of English - 262 - do not effectively demarcate grammatical examples; or to suggest that the enterprise of generative grammar is doomed because of the high proportion of rules required to deal with residual, particular cases. On the contrary, our analysis of the failures demonstrates that, for the most part, they are not parsed because of oversights in the ANLT grammar, rather than because they are deviant in syntactically mysterious ways. Sampson (1987a:226) concludes that the &amp;quot;onus must surely be on those who believe in the possibility of NL analysis by means of comprehensive generative grammars to explain why they suppose that the shape of constituent type/token distribution curves will be markedly different from the shallow straight line suggested by our limited - but not insignificant - database.&amp;quot; However, Sampson&apos;s result is suggested by his analysis of this data, not the data itself. In this paper, we have demonstrated that a more satisfactory analysis of essentially the same data-base leads to precisely the opposite conclusion. In ot</context>
