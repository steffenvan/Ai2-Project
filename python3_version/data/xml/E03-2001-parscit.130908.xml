<bodyText confidence="0.999699">
We present a prototype system aimed at
providing spoken dialogue support for
complex procedures aboard the Interna-
tional Space Station. The system allows
navigation one line at a time or in larger
steps. Other user functions include issu-
ing spoken corrections, requesting images
and diagrams, recording voice notes and
spoken alarms, and controlling audio vol-
ume.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780965517241">
The International Space Station recently entered
its second year as the first permanent human
presence in space. Astronauts on board Station
engage in a wide variety of tasks on orbit, includ-
ing medical procedures, extravehicular activity
(EVA), scientific payloads, and station repair and
maintenance. These tasks are documented in the
form of hierarchically organized procedures. In
some cases, a procedure will be performed by
one astronaut with another astronaut reading the
procedure out loud; in other cases the astronaut
will use the procedure and reference a paper (or
onscreen) copy of the procedure. The RIALIST
group has been developing a spoken dialogue
system for providing assistance with Space Sta-
tion procedures. This system has been developed
in a cooperative, iterative endeavor with substan-
tial input from astronauts, trainers, engineers, and
other NASA personnel. The first version of the
system operated on a simplified (and invented)
procedure for unpacking and operating a digital
camera (Aist et al. 2002), and included speech
input and speech output only. In this paper we
report on the current version of the checklist as-
sistant as of December 2002, which is set up to
run on XML-formatted actual Space Station pro-
cedures and includes speech input and multimo-
dal output (speech, images, and display of
HTML-formatted text.)

2 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980857142857">
The current crew on the ISS is limited to 3 astro-
nauts. During pre-flight training, astronauts re-
ceive training on basic systems operation, and
practice carrying out carefully designed proce-
dures to handle both nominal and off-nominal
operations. The number and variety of the pro-
cedures, as well as the duration of ISS missions,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996868">
187
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999787944444445">
precludes the kind of detailed training common
to shorter Apollo and Shuttle missions. Astro-
nauts on Station need to carry out procedures that
they may not have trained on specifically in ad-
vance, or may not have practiced for a consider-
able time. Current practice may require the
astronaut to follow through the procedure using a
text or computer monitor, or to have a second
astronaut read the procedure out loud to the one
executing it.
Our approach is to develop a spoken dia-
logue system provide assistance in reading the
procedure, tracking the progress through the pro-
cedure, and providing other assistance to support
correct and complete execution. The dialogue
system would thus free up the second astronaut
for other tasks, increasing Space Station utiliza-
tion.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.951369" genericHeader="method">
3 System description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999622">
The fundamental architecture of the system con-
sists of several components: audio processing,
speech recognition, language understanding, dia-
logue management, HTML and language genera-
tion, and visual display and speech synthesis.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997636">
3.1 Audio processing, speech recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999175142857143">
We use noise-canceling headset microphones for
audio input, transmitted via Sennheiser wireless
units to a laptop. Speech recognition is done with
Nuance 8 using a context-free language model
constructed from a unification grammar and then
compiled into a recognition model (Dowding et
al. 1993; Rayner, Dowding, and Hockey 2001).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999772">
3.2 Parsing and interpretation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953333333333">
The output of the speech recognizer is parsed
using SRI&apos; s Gemini parser. The text of the rec-
ognized speech and the resulting parse are then
fed to Alterf (Rayner and Hockey 2003), a robust
interpretation module which combines statistical
and rule-based interpretation to produce a se-
quence of tokens, such as &amp;quot;[load, water]&apos;. These
tokens are then assembled into predicate-
argument structure such as &amp;quot;load(water)&amp;quot;.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994744">
3.3 Dialogue management
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969309833333333">
We adopt a TRIPS-style division (Allen, Fergu-
son, and Stent 2001) of dialogue management
into three sections: input management, behavior
management, and output management (Figure 1).
In the December 2002 Checklist architecture,
however, there are multiple behavior agents, each
specialized by dialogue task: handling annota-
tions (e.g. pictures and voice notes), manipulat-
ing system settings (e.g. volume), and handling
procedure-based tasks (e.g. navigation). The dia-
logue input manager coordinates the interactions
between the multiple behavior agents.&apos;

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.388012">
3.4 Dialogue Input Management
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934266666667">
Each behavior agent has an agenda (Rudnicky
and Xu 1999) of the types of input it is expecting.
The behavior agents are maintained in a priority
queue according to recency of use. Incoming in-
terpretations such as &amp;quot;load(water)&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;in-
crease(volume)&amp;quot; are matched against each
behavior agent in turn. When a match is found,
that behavior agent is promoted to the top of the
queue and the message is dispatched to the agent.
This scheme allows us to coordinate multiple
behavior agents. Although in the December 2002
implementation the agenda is fixed for each dia-
logue agent, a better extension would make the
agendas dynamic in response to changes in dia-
logue state.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.88116975">
1 At one point we were labeling each behavior agent a &amp;quot;dia-
logue manager&amp;quot;. This resulted in calling the input manager
the &amp;quot;dialogue manager manager&amp;quot;; such reduplicative termi-
nology seemed baroque, so we fixed it.

3.5 Dialogue Behavior Agents
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999697628571428">
The Checklist system is capable of a number of
functions, as provided by the following dialogue
behavior agents.
Procedure agent (RavenClaw — Bohus and
Rudnicky 2002). Available functions include the
following.
Loading a procedure by saying, for example,
&amp;quot;Load water procedure&amp;quot;. The procedure is loaded
from disk as a XML document and converted
into HTML via XSL, and then rendered using
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). At the same time,
the procedure is processed using XSL into a task
description for use by the task-oriented dialogue
management component (RavenClaw).
Asking yes/no questions of the user, for example
&amp;quot;Are you ready to begin the procedure?&amp;quot; when
indicated by task constraints or by the structure
of the procedure itself.
Navigating through the procedure one line at a
time (&amp;quot;next line&amp;quot;) or one numbered step at a time
(&amp;quot;next step&amp;quot;), and returning to previous lines
(&amp;quot;previous line&amp;quot;) or previous numbered steps
(&amp;quot;previous step&amp;quot;).
Annotation agent handles a variety of tasks.
Requesting a list of available images by saying
&amp;quot;What pictures do you have?&amp;quot;.
Requesting a specific image by saying, for exam-
ple, &amp;quot;Show me the small waste water bag.&amp;quot;
Taking a voice note by saying, for example,
&amp;quot;Take a voice note.&amp;quot;
Audio agent handles request to change settings.
Setting an audio alarm by saying, for example,
&amp;quot;Set an alarm for three minutes from now.&amp;quot;
Controlling audio output volume by saying, for
example, &amp;quot;Speak up&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Quieter.&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.931945">
3.6 Dialogue Output Management
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998618">
Output requests from dialogue agents enter a
common output queue, where they are trans-
formed into a series of one or more display ac-
tions and/or strings of text to speak. The resulting
actions are played one at a time.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994263">
3.7 Visual display
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973666666667">
The procedure is displayed as an HTML docu-
ment (Figure 2), with the current step highlighted
in light blue, and the current substep (if any) dis-
played in black text on a white background (to
contrast with the light blue of the current (larger)
step).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998665">
3.8 Speech synthesis

<bodyText confidence="0.999826">
Speech synthesis is handled by AT&amp;T&apos;s speech
synthesizer, equipped with a customized pronun-
ciation dictionary.

<bodyText confidence="0.999374666666667">
Particular challenges to be addressed for the
Checklist system include telling whether the user
is speaking to the computer or to another person,
also known as &amp;quot;open mic&amp;quot; (work completed and
currently being evaluated), and robustness to the
noisy environment on board the Space Station.

Speech recognition is done with Nuance 8 using a context-free language model constructed from a unification grammar and then compiled into a recognition model (Dowding et al. 1993; Rayner, Dowding, and Hockey 2001). 3.2 Parsing and interpretation The output of the speech recognizer is parsed using SRI&apos; s Gemini parser. The text of the recognized speech and the resulting parse are then fed to Alterf (Rayner and Hockey 2003), a robust interpretation module which combines statistical and rule-based interpretation to produce a sequence of tokens, such as &amp;quot;[load, water]&apos;. These tokens are then assembled into predicateargument structure such as &amp;quot;load(water)&amp;quot;. 3.3 Dialogue management We adopt a TRIPS-style division (Allen, Ferguson, and Stent 2001) of dialogue management into three sections: input management, behavior management, and output management (Figure 1). In the December 2002 Checklist architecture, however, there are multiple behavior agents, each specialized by dialogue task: handling annotations (e.g. pictu</context>

In the December 2002 Checklist architecture, however, there are multiple behavior agents, each specialized by dialogue task: handling annotations (e.g. pictures and voice notes), manipulating system settings (e.g. volume), and handling procedure-based tasks (e.g. navigation). The dialogue input manager coordinates the interactions between the multiple behavior agents.&apos; Figure 1. December 2002 Checklist architecture. 3.4 Dialogue Input Management Each behavior agent has an agenda (Rudnicky and Xu 1999) of the types of input it is expecting. The behavior agents are maintained in a priority queue according to recency of use. Incoming interpretations such as &amp;quot;load(water)&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;increase(volume)&amp;quot; are matched against each behavior agent in turn. When a match is found, that behavior agent is promoted to the top of the queue and the message is dispatched to the agent. This scheme allows us to coordinate multiple behavior agents. Although in the December 2002 implementation the agenda is fixed for each dialogue agent, a better extension would make the agendas dynamic in response to changes in dialogu</context>
