Now that text editors, formatters, and spelling correctors
have become widely available, it is time to take the next
step and develop truly intelligent aids to document prepa-
ration. Our session describes systems that use artificial
intelligence techniques to analyze the grammar or the
meaning of the text. The understanding gained in this
analysis enables these systems to give substantial help in
creating or critiquing documents, to compose alternative
passages, or to correct grammar and diction. This session
was organized by the Association for Computational
Linguistics to present some of the best current applica-
tions in natural language processing.

1987 LINGUISTICS INSTITUTE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976746333333333">
29 June — 7 August 1987, Stanford University, California
The 1987 Summer Institute of the Linguistic Society of
America will be hosted by the Linguistics Department of
Stanford University, from 29 June to 7 August 1987. It
is co-sponsored by the Association for Computational
Linguistics.
The theme of the Institute is &amp;quot;Contextual and Compu-
tational Dimensions of Language&amp;quot;, and is meant to
reflect the ever-growing interest in integrating theories of
linguistic structure with theories of language processing
and models of how language conveys information in
context. The aim is to provide a forum in which it is
possible to integrate a variety of linguistic traditions,
particularly linguistic theory, computational linguistics,
discourse analysis, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and
artificial intelligence.
Several different kinds of courses and activities will be
offered during the six-week period of the Institute:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991419">
• A series of overview classes in the main subareas of
linguistics (six weeks, 3 units)
• A series of one-week intensive classes intended to
provide background for the four-3 week courses and
seminars below (29 June-July, 1 unit)
• Four-week classes on topics related directly to the
theme of the Institute (13 July-7 August, 2 units)
• Several seminars associated with research workshops
will run throughout the last four weeks. These can be
taken for credit, as part of the Stanford &amp;quot;directed
research&amp;quot; program [subject to prior approval of the
workshop leader] (up to three units)
• A series of Wednesday lectures (e.g., on the Synthesis
of Approaches to Discourse), involving Institute partic-
ipants and invited visitors.
• The Association for Computational Linguistics will
hold its annual meeting during the second week of the
Institute (6-10 July).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994171772727273">
This is the first time in recent years that two consec-
utive Institutes have been held with the same theme.
This complementarity of the 1986 Institute held at the
City University of New York and the 1987 Institute
reflects remarkable changes taking place today in the
field of linguistics. Taken together, the Institutes provide
the depth and diversity necessary to cover the newly
emerging subfields and to teach the range of interdiscipli-
nary tools and knowledge so fundamental to new theore-
tical approaches. The 1987 Institute at Stanford differs
from the 1986 Institute primarily in specific course offer-
ings and faculty and in its focus on providing a rich inter-
disciplinary research as well as teaching environment.
Many of the instructors will also be participating in
research groups; in general they will teach only one
course.
The Executive planning committee is: Ivan Sag
(Director), Ellen Prince (Associate Director), Marlys
Macken, Peter Sells, and Elizabeth Traugott. David Perl-
mutter will be the Sapir Professor, and Joseph Greenberg
the Collitz Professor of the 1987 Institute.

<bodyText confidence="0.997310636363636">
This international journal of the Chinese Language
Computer Society in annual volumes of four issues each.
Started in the summer of 1983, it contains state-of-the-
art papers written by experts from different parts of the
world. Its papers transcend disciplinary boundaries and
bridge language barriers.
This benchmark journal is international in scope,
interdisciplinary in approach and interactive in response
to the current trend of technology. It covers all aspects
related to computer processing of Chinese and oriental
languages; e.g., computer input and output of characters,
typesetting and design of characters, coding and
compressing of data, voice input and output, analysis,
recognition and synthesis of speech, man-computer
communications, language processing and text under-
standing, representation of knowledge and inferencing,
computational linguistics, automatic translation, software
and design of Chinese language computers, database
management and systems, information retrieval, text
handling, question answering, applications of theories,
new methods, techniques, and developments.

AFIPS CONDUCTS TIE WORKSHOP
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994">
The pilot phase of a new educational resource, the Tech-
nology in Education (TIE) project, was launched by the
American Federation of Information Processing Societies
(AFIPS) on November 1 and 2, 1985, at the Phyllis E.
Williams Elementary School in Prince George&apos;s Country,
Maryland. TIE was developed as a results of AFIPS&apos;s
commitment to help educators intensify the use of
computers and high technology in pre-college education.
The main vehicle for TIE was a two-day workshop
conducted by the Minnesota Education Computing
Consortium. The first day of the workshop dealt with
planning, implementation, and evaluation of computers in
schools while the second day provided guidance on the
effective use of volunteers. During the workshop, 20
country educators were paired with 20 computer profes-
sionals from the Washington metropolitan area. It is
expected that the partnerships formed between these
educators and volunteers will results in a continuing
support system which will directly benefit educators and
students in Prince George&apos;s County. Pending favorable
evaluation of the pilot phase, AFIPS expects to expand
the project to 20 additional sites nationwide during 1986.

This complementarity of the 1986 Institute held at the City University of New York and the 1987 Institute reflects remarkable changes taking place today in the field of linguistics. Taken together, the Institutes provide the depth and diversity necessary to cover the newly emerging subfields and to teach the range of interdisciplinary tools and knowledge so fundamental to new theoretical approaches. The 1987 Institute at Stanford differs from the 1986 Institute primarily in specific course offerings and faculty and in its focus on providing a rich interdisciplinary research as well as teaching environment. Many of the instructors will also be participating in research groups; in general they will teach only one course.</abstract>

<note confidence="0.810841666666667">(AFIPS) on November 1 and 2, 1985, at the Phyllis E. Williams Elementary School in Prince George&apos;s Country, Maryland. TIE was developed as a results of AFIPS&apos;s</note>
<abstract confidence="0.9781036875">commitment to help educators intensify the use of computers and high technology in pre-college education. The main vehicle for TIE was a two-day workshop conducted by the Minnesota Education Computing Consortium. The first day of the workshop dealt with planning, implementation, and evaluation of computers in schools while the second day provided guidance on the effective use of volunteers. During the workshop, 20 country educators were paired with 20 computer professionals from the Washington metropolitan area. It is expected that the partnerships formed between these educators and volunteers will results in a continuing support system which will directly benefit educators and students in Prince George&apos;s County. Pending favorable evaluation of the pilot phase, AFIPS expects to expand the project to 20 additional sites nationwide during 1986.</abstract>
