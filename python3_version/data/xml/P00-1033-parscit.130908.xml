<bodyText confidence="0.998548636363636">
Following a dependency-based
framework that admits no interme-
diate phrasal nodes and allows no
crossing of syntactic dependency
links, we discuss how Chinese sen-
tences are analysed and annotated
using an SGML-based scheme.
Issues related to tolerance of errors
at various levels of analysis and
compatibility with other syntactic
frameworks are addressed.

<bodyText confidence="0.979091651162791">
We annotate the syntactic dependency be-
tween lexical units in a linguistic expres-
sion according to art approach to Dependency
Grammar (Tesniere, 1959) that cart be traced
back to (Gaifman, 1965; Hays, 1964; Robin-
son, 1970). We require syntactic dependency
to be projective, and capture non-projective
syntactic phenomena in language with con-
straints defined with reference to this projec-
tive skeleton (Lai and Huang, 1998b; Lai and
Huang, 1998a; Lai and Huang, 1999a; Lai and
Huang, 1999b). This is different from ap-
proaches that allow multiple heads and cross-
ing dependency links (Hudson, 1984; Mel&apos;Cuk,
1988; Starosta, 1988; HajiCova, 1991). we
also require the relationship between a gov-
ernor and all its dependents to be immedi-
ate. There are no intermediate phrasal nodes
as in some other projective-dependency-based
parsing approaches (Hellwig, 1986; Coving-
ton, 1990; Courtin and GentMal, 1998; Bour-
don et al., 1998; Nagao, 1993). A similar ap-
proach has been adopted in some recent works
on Chinese (Huang et al., 1992; Yuan and
Huang, 1992; Zhou and Huang, 1994).
As a start, we manually give parse structure
annotation to a small Chinese legal text cor-
pus. The text is &amp;quot;segmented&amp;quot; and tagged, and
morphological analysis is then carried out to
confirm and adjust word boundaries. Syntac-
tic units larger than the word are annotated
using art SGML-based scheme. We have also
found it useful to identify units smaller than
the word like characters and dictionary en-
tries.
In the sections that follow, we give a short
description of the underlying dependency-
based grammar formalism, a description of
the annotation scheme. We also discuss some
morphological and syntactic complications,
and their implications for tolerance of errors
and compatibility with other grammar for-
malisms.

<bodyText confidence="0.99936775">
We follow Robinson (1970) in requiring syn-
tactic dependency structures to observe the
constraints of single-headedness and projectiv-
ity.
Robinson requires that all words (except for
the head of the whole expression) should de-
pend ort exactly one other word in the expres-
sion. She also requires that no dependency
links should cross arty other. For example,
the projective syntactic dependency structure
for the Chinese sentence ta xiang xiao Ole
wants/wanted to laugh&apos;) is as in Figure 1.
There is no explicit syntactic link between ta
and xiao. The fact that ta is the subject of
xiao is accounted for by the &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; spec-
ification in the lexical entry of the word xi-

ang that its subject is the subject of its pred-
icate complement. Grammatical constraints
like these propagate via the nodes and arcs
of a projective syntactic dependency skeleton.
Constraints that account for movement-like
phenomena work similarly.
We use dependency rules (Hays, 1964) to
generate dependency structures. We make
the dependency rules (1) binary-branching.

Repeated application of these two depen-
dency rules under the constraints of the sub-
categorization properties of the governing
word and global constraints of the language
accounts for dependent elements in its &amp;quot;do-
main&amp;quot;. The actual order in which the depen-
dents are arranged depends orf how the sub-
categorization information in the lexical entry
of the governor is organized, and orf how sub-
categorization information is retrieved for use
in the dependency rules.
In the binary rules (1), the H symbols
orf the two sides of the rule are not only of
the same type, as in phrase-structure rewrite
rules, but identical as tokens. A linguistic ex-
presssion is thus indistinguishable from the
subcategorizing head word. A head word and
its dependents form a flat structure without
intermediate phrasal nodes.

3.1 Pilot study with a small text
corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998799285714286">
To study how we will be able to annotate cor-
pora according to our dependency-based ap-
proach in a way that the corpora will also
be useful to other researchers, we begirt with
manually annotating a small corpus. It is also
hoped that this piloting effort will throw light
orf how we may make use of large annotated
corpora produced by other people.
We use a small corpus of Chinese text
segmented and tagged using a bigram-based
segmentation-tagging tool (Lai et al., 1992;
Lai et al., 1998). The corpus is two &amp;quot;chap-
ters&amp;quot; of a statute in Hong Kong containing
4797 word tokens.

3.2 The annotation scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999648833333333">
The annotation scheme is based orf SGML
(SGML, 1986). The largest tag unit is the
parsing unit (&lt;pu&gt;) that marks off chunks
of text that are ready to be processed by a
syntactic parser. It has a pi attribute to re-
flect its position in the text. For example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.980476">
&lt;Fa&amp;quot; pi=3&gt;&amp;quot;7&amp;quot; II II 111&amp;quot;
&lt;!--&apos;7.1&apos;--&gt;&lt;/pu&gt;
&lt;pu pi=4&gt;mxing2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;shi4&amp;quot;
&lt;!--&apos;form&apos;--&gt;&lt;/pu&gt;
&lt;pu pi=5&gt;m7m II II 11111 m.m 11111
&lt;pu pi=6&gt;mhe2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;yue4&amp;quot; &amp;quot;yinl&amp;quot;

In this example, the parsing units are a
section number in Arabic numberals, a sec-
tion caption, a subsection number, and a one-
sentence text. Parsing units may be sen-
tences (e.g. &lt;pu pi=6&gt;), phrases (e.g. &lt;pu
pi=4&gt;), or non-phrasal units like &lt;pu pi=3&gt;
and &lt;pu pi=5&gt;. They are the units from
which to build larger discourse units (which
is beyond the scope of this paper).
Words form the units of syntactic analysis.
For example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.966201555555556">
&lt;pu pi=6&gt;
&lt;wu wi=1 gy=7 fn=sub ct=nc
sm=&amp;quot;contract&amp;quot;&gt;&amp;quot;he2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;yue4&amp;quot;
&lt;wu wi=7 gy=0 ct=aux sm=&amp;quot;maym&gt;
&amp;quot;ke3&amp;quot; &amp;quot;neng2&amp;quot;
&lt;wu wi=8 gy=7 fn=axo ct=aj
sm=&amp;quot;inyalid&amp;quot;&gt;&amp;quot;wu2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;xiao4&amp;quot;
&lt;wu wi=13 gy=7 fn=pt ct&apos;. .&amp;quot;&gt;&amp;quot;.
&lt;/pu&gt;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997192363636364">
The &lt;wn&gt; elements have a wi (for word
index) attribute that marks their positions
within the &lt;pu&gt; unit. (Some words in the ex-
ample are omitted for the sake of clarity.) De-
pendency hierarchy is marked with the help of
the gv (for governor) attribute, which records
the wi value of the governor of a word. A
value of 0 for gv shows that the word is the
head element of the &lt;pu&gt;. The syntactic cat-
egory of the word is given in the ct (for cat-
egory) attribute, and its &amp;quot;grammatical&amp;quot; rela-
tion to its immediate governor is the value of
the fn (for function) attribute. The seman-
tic glosses of the words are given in their sm
attributes.
Words are formed from dictionary units
(&lt;du&gt;), forms that are listed in Chinese dic-
tionaries.
&lt;wu wi=1 ct=nc sm=&amp;quot;contractm&gt;
&lt;du tg=ncd&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;he2&amp;quot;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;yue4&amp;quot;
Dictionary units are made up of one or
more characters (&lt;cu&gt;). Words and dictio-
nary units are considered differents kinds of
entities because of morphological complica-
tions to be discussed later in this paper. The
relation of the tg (for tag) attributes of dic-
tionary units (du) to the ct attributes of the
words will be explained later.
The characters (&lt;cu&gt;) are the terminal
text elements in our annotation scheme. They
are multiple-byte Chinese (Han) characters.
In this paper, they are written in the pho-
netic pinyin script for the ease of rendering
and reading.
In our annotation scheme, the tags &lt;tint&gt;
and &lt;cu&gt; correspond to the &lt;w&gt; and &lt;c&gt;
tags for linguistic segmentation elements in
CES (Ide et al., 1996). The morphological
unit (to be introduced and discussed in the
next section) is, however, not of the same na-
ture as the &lt;m&gt; tag in CES. We do not have
tags corresponding to &lt;c/&gt; and &lt;phr&gt; in
CES.
Thus, parsing units (&lt;pu&gt;) in our anno-
tation scheme are flat ensembles of words
(&lt; wu&gt;). The governor (&lt;gv&gt;) attributes
of the words reflect the dependency hierar-
chy. Words are made up of dictionary units
(&lt;du&gt;), which are in turn made up of char-
acters (&lt;cu&gt;). The basic text elements are
the characters. Morphological complications
are discussed in the next section.

Our segmentation-tagging module pro-
duces three separate &amp;quot;tokens&amp;quot;. We adjust
the word boundaries and group the three one-
character tokens together into one single word
(&lt; wu&gt;), which is a kind or numerical label.
The segmentation-tagging module seg-
ments the text into tokens according to crite-
ria popular among researchers in China Main-
land. The three characters 7, &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; and 1 are
listed as entries in our dictionary, and they
combine transparently to form the word 7.1,
which is, with good reasons, not listed in dic-
tionary. We group the three characters into
a word, but we also retain the information
that this word is composed from the three
one-character dictionary entries. The dictio-
nary tags assigned to these three tokens are
retained in the tg attribute of (&lt;du&gt;).
Researchers may not agree on how to &amp;quot;seg-
ment&amp;quot; art expression like this example &lt;pu&gt;.
What we consider to be one word may be
three words to some people. Because of this,
we have taken care that the original charac-
ters, as well as the order in which they occur,
are retained in the marked up text. This is in
accordance with good text encoding practice.
Recovery from error and re-analysis by other
researchers will also be made easier.
4.2 Deriviational and inflectional
morphology
Although Chinese is often said to be a lan-
guage without (much) morphology, there are
morphological issues that cause complications
with the projective-based dependency anno-
tation.
Consider the following two parse units from
OUT corpus:
&lt;pu pi=1&gt;
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.496178875">
&lt;mu mil wu=1&gt;&lt;du tg=hm&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;di4&amp;quot;
&lt;wu wi=1 gv=2 fn=nm ct=mx
sm=&amp;quot;seventh&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;du tg=mx &gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;qi1&amp;quot;
&lt;wu wi=2 gv=0 ct=ncl
sm=&amp;quot;chapterm&gt;
&lt;du tg=cnb&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;zhangl&amp;quot;
&lt;/pu&gt;
&lt;pu pi=2&gt;
&lt;wu wi=1 gv=0 fn=sub ct=nc mh=&amp;quot;de&amp;quot;
sm=&amp;quot;contractm&gt;
&lt;du tg=ncd&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;he2&amp;quot;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;yue4&amp;quot;
&lt;mu mil wu=1&gt;&lt;du tg=ed&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;de&amp;quot;
&lt;wu wi=2 gv=0 fn=sub ct=na
sm=&amp;quot;formm&gt;
&lt;du tg=nad&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;xing2&amp;quot;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;shi4&amp;quot;
&lt;/pu&gt;
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999555">
In the first parsing unit (pi = 1), our seg-
mentation and tagging module outputs di4
and gi1 as separate tokens. In the second
parsing unit (pi = 2), he2, yue,( and de
are also separate tokens. We consider di4gi1
(`seventh&apos;) and he2yue4de (`contract&apos;+GEN)
to be words, but we mark off di4 and de as
morphological units (&lt;mu&gt;). As morpholog-
ical units are not words, they do not have
wi attributes. Instead, the stems that they
are attached to are recorded in their Tim at-
tributes. As they are themselves listed in the
dictionary (a common practice in Chinese),
they are marked as &lt;du&gt; and their tg at-
tributes are retained. This is a conscous effort
to retain information in the original text.
In the first example, di4gi1 (`seventh&apos;) is a
derived word. The stem &lt;du&gt; gi1 (`seven&apos;)
bears the &lt;tun&gt;. The attributes (e.g. cate-
gory and semantic gloss) of the word unit are
those of the derived word.
In the second example, he2yue,(de (`con-
tract&apos;+GEN) is art inflected form of the word
he2yue.4. The stem carries the word unit,
which is marked with art mh attribute (for
morphology). When the inflected word is ac-
cessed for syntactic analysis, the affix does
not have to be accessed because the required
information is already recorded in this at-
tribute.
Further complications with morphological
analysis are illustrated by the following ex-
amples from a (stylistically more balanced)
newspaper corpus we are working ort:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.928642875">
&lt;pu&gt;
&lt;wu wi=1 gv=0 ct=vn mh=&amp;quot;perf&amp;quot;

&lt;mu mil wu=1&gt;&lt;du tg=e1&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;le&amp;quot;
&lt;mu mi=2 wu=1&gt;&lt;du tg=ncm&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;fan4&amp;quot;
&lt;/pu&gt;
&lt;pu&gt;
&lt;wu wi=1 gv=0 ct=adj mh=&amp;quot;dup, de&amp;quot;
sm=&amp;quot;happym&gt;
&lt;du mu=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot; tg=ad&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;gaol&amp;quot;
&lt;mu mil wu=1&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;gaol&amp;quot;
&lt;mu mi=2 wu=1&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;xing4&amp;quot;
&lt;mu mi=3 wu=1&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;xing4&amp;quot;
&lt;mu mi=4 wu=1&gt;&lt;du tg=ed&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;de&amp;quot;
&lt;/pu&gt;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967204081633">
In the first example, all infix le is in-
serted between the two characters of the word
chi1fan.4. As is common in linugistic and
computational research ort Chinese, our seg-
mentation module &amp;quot;segments&amp;quot; the text rather
than &amp;quot;lemmatizes&amp;quot;. It outputs three one-
character tokens, which, in Chinese, are all
valid dictionary entries. With these tokens
as input, we lemmatize, but we take care
to make sure that the original output of the
segmentation-tagging tool is recoverable. The
word unit is accessed through the first non-
affix character, and its syntactic and seman-
tic attributes (ct and sin) have values corre-
sponding to the whole word, not those corre-
sponding to the character.
The second example poses even more prob-
lems for the simple markup method in Sec-
tion 4.1. The word is made up of the sin-
gle two-character dictionary entry gaolxing4.
However, the morphological process of redu-
plication has been applied, and each of the
two characters is repeated to give a four-
character word. As the segmenation-tagging
module does not lemmatize and does not
meddle with the order in which the char-
acters occur, its output is (somewhat erro-
neously) the four-token sequence of gaol gaol
xing4 xing4. These characters are all valid
dictionary entries in Chinese themselves, but
they do not combine transparently to form
the word gaolgaolxing4xing4, which is a de-
rived word. In our annotation, only the first
&lt;du&gt; bears the word unit tag. When the du-
plicated word is accessed for syntactic analy-
sis, its &lt;mh&gt; attribute is available to give
the necessary grammatical information. The
three trailing &lt;mu&gt; are neglected. As shown
in the example, when we deal with this kind
of morphology, we take care to ensure that
the original output of the segmentation tool
is preserved.
The second example also contains a mor-
phological affix de. It may be noted that the
mh value of the &lt;du&gt; that carries the word
unit tag is now a list (in the form of a quoted
character string to conform to SGML). This
serves to illustrate how multiple affixes at-
tached to a stem are dealt with.

4.3 Portability implications

<bodyText confidence="0.99997">
The lack of general agreement among theo-
retical and computational linguists about how
morphology is treated in Chinese has made it
difficult for linguistically annotated resources
to be shared. We must adopt a particular ap-
proach in our own work, but by preserving
the morphemes and characters in their origi-
nal positions, it is hoped that our annotations
will be useful to other researchers.

A more serious portability concern of syntac-
tic annotation is the fact that different re-
searchers may prefer to use different gram-
mar formalisms and syntactic theories in their
work. Efforts like the PENN Treebank (Mar-
cus et al., 1994) have tried to minimize the
differences by adopting a basic bracketing
scheme, but the problem is that different ap-
proaches may require different ways of brack-
eting for the same linguistic expression. Con-
sider the following example from our corpus:

&lt;/pu&gt;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991107142857">
The first word (tvi. = 1) yinl (`because&apos;) is
marked as a subordinating conjunction (ct =
cnj). In our annotation, it is governed by the
head word (tvi. = 4) of the embedded sentence
(tvi. = 1 to tvi. = 5), he2 (`conform/satisfy&apos;),
for which it functions somewhat like a marker
in HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994). In HPSG,
this is a preposition (that does not have a
noun phrase complement), but as it is never-
theless often considered to be a daughter of
the (embedded) sentence, there is no serious
parse structure disagreement between HPSG
and our annotation. However, if one follows
more popular approaches like the Cliomskyan
school, one may prefer to reverse the direction
of the dependency the subordinating con-
junction will be higher up in the dependency
hierarchy than the predicate verb in the em-
bedded sentence.
As there is no general consensus about what
parse structure to give to a linguistic expres-
sion, it will be in vain for us to attempt to find
parse structures that are generally accepted.
What we can do, and have done, is to label
arcs of our parse structures with the depen-
dency relation names, thus leaving the hope
alive that our parse structures may be con-
vertible for use with other approaches.

lit Our annotation, the auxiliary neng2
(`can&apos;) governs the verb li3xing2 (`carry out&apos;),
which governs its own argument daughter
he2gue4 (`contract&apos;).
However, in recent developments of HPSG
motivated by the study of German (Nerbonne
et al., 1994) and the Romance languages
(Balari and Dini, 1998), the auxiliary verb is
considered to pull up the arguments of the
lexical verb into its own domain by means of
a process known as argument extraction or
composition. Under such an analysis, the syn-
tactic dependency structure will be:

The two structures are different. Fortu-

is involved, conversion of parse structures in
either direction is possible if the nature of
the relevant dependency links (in terms of the
grammar formalism used) is available in the

In our annotation scheme, the basic unit for
building syntactic dependency is the word.
Below the word, we have morphological units
and dictionary entries, and the characters
form the terminal text elements.
The adequacy of our annotation scheme
can be gauged by comparing it to the &amp;quot;lay-
ers&amp;quot; of annotation in the preliminary recom-
mendations on syntactic annotation of cor-
pora of EAGLES (1996): (a) bracketing of
segments, (b) labelling the category of seg-
ments, (c) showing dependency relations, (d)
indicating syntactic function labels, (e) mark-
ing subclassification of syntactic segments, (f)
logical relations of various kinds, (g) informa-
tion about the rank of a syntactic unit and
(11) information about spoken language non-
fluency phenomena. Our annotation scheme
includes layers (c) and (d) directly. Layers (a)
and are covered by treating dependents (and
recursively dependents thereof) of a word as
its phrasal projection. Layer (e) is taken care
of by a larger-than-minimal tagset and gram-
matical information stored in the lexical en-
tries, which also help to cover layer (f). As we
do not have intermediate phrasal categories
in our dependency formalism, layer (g) is not
relevant. Layer (11) is not relevant for text
corpora.
In our annotation scheme, the sub-word
units of morphological units, dictionary units
and the terminal text elements (characters)
collaborate to take care of morphological com-
plications. We take care to preserve the ter-
minal text elements to enable re-analysis and
recovery from errors. Grammatical functions
are marked to facililate conversion for use
with other grammatical formulations.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972583333333">
We have described how we perform syntac-
tic and morphological annotation of a small
corpus of Chinese text. The SGML-based an-
notation scheme has been designed to ensure
good tolerance of errors of analysis at vari-
ous levels and portability to and from other
grammatical formalisms and syntactic theo-
ries. Future efforts will be in two directions
scaling up with a stylistically more bal-
anced corpus, and importing and adapting
annotations performed according to other ap-
proaches.

The relation of the tg (for tag) attributes of dictionary units (du) to the ct attributes of the words will be explained later. The characters (&lt;cu&gt;) are the terminal text elements in our annotation scheme. They are multiple-byte Chinese (Han) characters. In this paper, they are written in the phonetic pinyin script for the ease of rendering and reading. In our annotation scheme, the tags &lt;tint&gt; and &lt;cu&gt; correspond to the &lt;w&gt; and &lt;c&gt; tags for linguistic segmentation elements in CES (Ide et al., 1996). The morphological unit (to be introduced and discussed in the next section) is, however, not of the same nature as the &lt;m&gt; tag in CES. We do not have tags corresponding to &lt;c/&gt; and &lt;phr&gt; in CES. Thus, parsing units (&lt;pu&gt;) in our annotation scheme are flat ensembles of words (&lt; wu&gt;).

We must adopt a particular approach in our own work, but by preserving the morphemes and characters in their original positions, it is hoped that our annotations will be useful to other researchers. 5 Complications with Syntactic Bracketing 5.1 Different parse structures according to different approaches A more serious portability concern of syntactic annotation is the fact that different researchers may prefer to use different grammar formalisms and syntactic theories in their work. Efforts like the PENN Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) have tried to minimize the differences by adopting a basic bracketing scheme, but the problem is that different approaches may require different ways of bracketing for the same linguistic expression. Consider the following example from our corpus: &lt;pu pi=8&gt; &lt;wu wi=1 gv=4 fn=mks ct=cnj sm=&amp;quot;because&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;du tg=jom&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;yinl&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=2 gv=4 fn=sub ct=na sm=&amp;quot;formm&gt; &lt;du tg=nad&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;xing2&amp;quot;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;shi4&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=3 gv=4 fn=neg ct=adv sm=&amp;quot;neg&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;du tg=bu&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;bu4&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=4 gv=8 fn=ajt ct=vt sm=&amp;quot;conform&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;du tg=vnm&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;he2&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=5 gv=4 fn=obj ct=na sm=&amp;quot;stipulation&amp;quot;› &lt;du tg=nad&gt;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;guil&amp;quot;&lt;cu&gt;&amp;quot;ge2&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=8 gv=1</context>

Consider the following example (unnecessary details omitted): &lt;pu&gt; &lt;wu wi=1 gy=0 sm=&amp;quot;can&amp;quot;&gt;&amp;quot;neng2&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=2 gy=1 sm=&amp;quot;carry out&amp;quot;› &amp;quot;1i3&amp;quot; &amp;quot;xing2&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi3 gy=2 sm=&amp;quot;contractm&gt; &amp;quot;he2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;yue4&amp;quot; &lt;/pu&gt; lit Our annotation, the auxiliary neng2 (`can&apos;) governs the verb li3xing2 (`carry out&apos;), which governs its own argument daughter he2gue4 (`contract&apos;). However, in recent developments of HPSG motivated by the study of German (Nerbonne et al., 1994) and the Romance languages (Balari and Dini, 1998), the auxiliary verb is considered to pull up the arguments of the lexical verb into its own domain by means of a process known as argument extraction or composition. Under such an analysis, the syntactic dependency structure will be: &lt;pu&gt; &lt;wu wi=1 gy=0 sm=&amp;quot;can&amp;quot;&gt;&amp;quot;neng2&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi=2 gy=1 sm=&amp;quot;carry out&amp;quot;› &amp;quot;1i3&amp;quot; &amp;quot;xing2&amp;quot; &lt;wu wi3 gy=1 &amp;quot;contract&amp;quot;› &amp;quot;he2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;yue4&amp;quot; &lt;/pu&gt; The two structures are different.

In HPSG, this is a preposition (that does not have a noun phrase complement), but as it is nevertheless often considered to be a daughter of the (embedded) sentence, there is no serious parse structure disagreement between HPSG and our annotation. However, if one follows more popular approaches like the Cliomskyan school, one may prefer to reverse the direction of the dependency the subordinating conjunction will be higher up in the dependency hierarchy than the predicate verb in the embedded sentence.

Issues related to tolerance of errors at various levels of analysis and compatibility with other syntactic frameworks are addressed. 1 Introduction We annotate the syntactic dependency between lexical units in a linguistic expression according to art approach to Dependency Grammar (Tesniere, 1959) that cart be traced back to (Gaifman, 1965; Hays, 1964; Robinson, 1970). We require syntactic dependency to be projective, and capture non-projective syntactic phenomena in language with constraints defined with reference to this projective skeleton (Lai and Huang, 1998b; Lai and Huang, 1998a; Lai and Huang, 1999a; Lai and Huang, 1999b). This is different from approaches that allow multiple heads and crossing dependency links (Hudson, 1984; Mel&apos;Cuk, 1988; Starosta, 1988; HajiCova, 1991). we also require the relationship between a governor and all its dependents to be immediate.

Syntactic units larger than the word are annotated using art SGML-based scheme. We have also found it useful to identify units smaller than the word like characters and dictionary entries. In the sections that follow, we give a short description of the underlying dependencybased grammar formalism, a description of the annotation scheme. We also discuss some morphological and syntactic complications, and their implications for tolerance of errors and compatibility with other grammar formalisms. 2 Projective dependency syntax We follow Robinson (1970) in requiring syntactic dependency structures to observe the constraints of single-headedness and projectivity. Robinson requires that all words (except for the head of the whole expression) should depend ort exactly one other word in the expression. She also requires that no dependency links should cross arty other. For example, the projective syntactic dependency structure for the Chinese sentence ta xiang xiao Ole wants/wanted to laugh&apos;) is as in Figure 1. There is no explicit syntactic link between ta and xiao. The fact that ta is the subject of xiao is accounted for by the &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; speci</context>

It is also hoped that this piloting effort will throw light orf how we may make use of large annotated corpora produced by other people. We use a small corpus of Chinese text segmented and tagged using a bigram-based segmentation-tagging tool (Lai et al., 1992; Lai et al., 1998). The corpus is two &amp;quot;chapters&amp;quot; of a statute in Hong Kong containing 4797 word tokens. 3.2 The annotation scheme The annotation scheme is based orf SGML (SGML, 1986). The largest tag unit is the parsing unit (&lt;pu&gt;) that marks off chunks of text that are ready to be processed by a syntactic parser. It has a pi attribute to reflect its position in the text. For example: &lt;Fa&amp;quot; pi=3&gt;&amp;quot;7&amp;quot; II II 111&amp;quot; &lt;!--&apos;7.1&apos;--&gt;&lt;/pu&gt; &lt;pu pi=4&gt;mxing2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;shi4&amp;quot; &lt;!--&apos;form&apos;--&gt;&lt;/pu&gt; &lt;pu pi=5&gt;m7m II II 11111 m.m 11111 &lt;pu pi=6&gt;mhe2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;yue4&amp;quot; &amp;quot;yinl&amp;quot; &amp;quot;xing2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;shi4&amp;quot; &amp;quot;bu4&amp;quot; &amp;quot;he2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;guil&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ge2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ke3&amp;quot; &amp;quot;neng2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;wu2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;xiao4&amp;quot; &amp;quot;huo4&amp;quot; &amp;quot;bu4&amp;quot; &amp;quot;neng2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;li3&amp;quot; &amp;quot;xing2&amp;quot; &amp;quot;..&amp;quot; &lt;!--&apos;contracts rendered invalid or becoming impossible to carry out because their forms do not conform to specifications--&gt;&lt;/pu&gt; In this</context>
