A Note from the Editor:
This issue of the American Journal of Computational Lin-
guistics (AJCL) is a combined issue for the third and fourth
quarters of 1980. It is Number 3-4, dated July-December.
This issue contains 94 pages, which is almost double the 50
pages per quarterly issue stated in my original proposal for
producing this hard-copy Journal. [Details may be found in
the news article on page 49 of the January-March 1980 issue
of AJCL and in the proposal reproduced on page 68 in the
Microfiche Supplement of that issue.] The first two quarterly
issues of 1980 consisted of 62 and 64 hard-copy pages, respec-
tively. These three issues together, then, provide a total of
220 hard-copy pages for the year (plus 9 pages of Microfiche
Supplement). Included in these issues are nine rather long
technical articles (130 pages), ten book reviews (16 pages),
133 abstracts (34 pages), a complete membership list (18
pages), and announcements, minutes and programs of meet-
ings, etc. (22 pages).
In July, Michael McCord of the University of Kentucky
became Associate Editor, and in October, Andrea McKenzie of
IBM Research became Editorial Assistant. Both of these
people contributed substantially to the publication of this issue.
In 1981 we intend to publish four smaller issues on a more
nearly regular schedule. We currently have about 25 articles
being refereed, about 25 books to be reviewed, and a backlog
of about 25 abstracts to publish. But, we would like to have
still more. We continue to welcome submissions of technical
articles and other material (especially abstracts of technical
reports and announcements of meetings) according to the
guidelines given on the inside back cover.
