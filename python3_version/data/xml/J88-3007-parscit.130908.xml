INTRODUCTION TO THE DISCUSSION SECTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959744680852">
As soon as the aim of natural language systems extends
beyond the mere processing of isolated sentences or
interaction with the user through isolated question-
answer pairs, it becomes necessary for the system to
maintain some sort of record of both the user&apos;s and the
system&apos;s previous dialog contributions. In its simplest
form, such a record would contain the objects being
mentioned, and the recency of them being mentioned
(the notion of &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; is used here in a broad sense,
also denoting actions, events, states, etc.). Such a
record may be exploited, for example, in resolving or
generating anaphora, which in general may only refer to
those objects that have been mentioned recently. Also
the choice between definite and indefinite articles de-
pends, among other factors, upon whether or not the
objects being referred to have already been introduced
in the previous dialog.
A slightly improved dialog record would not only
contain the objects that have been mentioned, but also
the (conceptual representation of) the dialog contribu-
tions themselves. This can be exploited, for example, in
the analysis of argumentative structures in discourse,
that is, for determining why one argument supports
some other argument. More advanced forms would
include representations of the current and previous
dialog focuses, themes, dialog substructures, and dialog
rules employed by the system, etc. The notion of
&amp;quot;discourse model&amp;quot; has recently found wide acceptance
for referring to this representation of the structure of a
discourse.
However, when the user mentions an object in a
dialog contribution, the system can assume that the user
knows (or believes in the existence of) the mentioned
object or the properties being attributed to it. These
assumptions about the user must be taken into account
in generating cooperative dialog contributions and cer-
tainly form part of the user model. For instance, from
the UNIX commands the user mentions, the help sys-
tem of Chin (1988) can draw assumptions about his/her
level of expertise. Or, when the user asks, &amp;quot;Who is the
present king of France?&amp;quot;, a cooperative system might
check the correctness of the user&apos;s belief that can be
inferred from his/her question. Conversely, when the
system mentions some fact, it can also assume that,
from now on, the user knows this fact and regard it as
being common knowledge, for instance within explana-
tions.
Thus there seems to be some relationship between
user models and discourse models, at least in view of
the fact that entries that should be part of the discourse
model might also possibly be contained in the user
model in a similar form. At the user modeling meeting in
Maria Laach, a talk by Ethel Schuster about this
relationship provoked a lengthy discussion. Opinions
that were propounded included that the discourse model
and the user model are separate, but related to each
other; that the discourse model is part of the user
model; that the user model is part of the discourse
model; that user model and discourse model are two
sides of the same coin; and also that a discussion on the
relationship doesn&apos;t make any sense since, as soon as
the two concepts have been precisely defined, the
problem will disappear.
It was agreed, however, that the discussion should be
continued in written form in order to better pinpoint
what issues are controversial and which ones are undis-
puted with respect to the question at hand. The discus-
sion at the Maria Laach workshop was recorded on
tape, so that transcripts could be prepared and distrib-
uted among the participants. Also, the first draft of each
written contribution was circulated, so as to give the
discussants the chance to respond to the rebuttals of
their colleagues. Moreover, in order to filter out weaker
contributions, all papers were subjected to an internal
rating by all participants and reviewed by the editorial
board of Computational Linguistics.
In order to increase the coherency of the discussion
and to avoid redundant terminological definitions, two
papers were chosen to form a common point of refer-
ence, namely Schuster&apos;s contribution and the paper by
Grosz and Sidner (1986). The authors were told to
assume that readers are familiar with these two works
and to refer to them whenever possible in order to avoid
redundancy. The papers should not serve as a target of
repeated critique (as, for example, in the BBS journal),
but form a common basis for the discussion.
Moreover, contributors were asked to define, as
precisely as possible, in what sense they used the terms
user model and discourse model. Most discussants
regard the user model as containing &amp;quot;the system&apos;s
beliefs about its users&amp;quot; (Schuster). Kobsa and Wahlster
require that, in addition, &amp;quot;the user model be separable
by the system from the rest of the system&apos;s knowledge&amp;quot;
(Kobsa). And Cohen claims that &amp;quot;the user model must

concentrate on information which is dynamic, has some
potential for change&amp;quot;.
As far as the notion of discourse model is concerned,
most discussants probably agree with Cohen&apos;s analysis
that it includes &amp;quot;everything that should be derived from
an analysis of discourse, to present a representation for
the structure of the discourse, useful in subsequently
responding&amp;quot;. And, following Grosz and Sidner (1986)—
who, however, never used the term discourse model but
only discourse structure—most contributors basically
agree in that a discourse model consists of a linguistic
structure (&amp;quot;the structure of the actual sequences of
utterances in the discourse&amp;quot; (Grosz and Sidner 1986, p.
176), an intentional structure (the relationship between
discourse segment purposes), and an attentional struc-
ture (&amp;quot;abstraction of the focus of attention of the
discourse participants&amp;quot;, p. 177). Kobsa and Monk, in
addition, discern a dialog memory which they regard as
part of (Kobsa) or identical with (Monk) the attentional
structure. Cohen slightly reinterprets the term inten-
tional structure.
Two authors hold divergent opinions with respect to
discourse models: Schuster defines them only as &amp;quot;con-
taining representations of entities&amp;quot; mentioned in the
ongoing discourse, &amp;quot;along with their properties and
relations they participate in&amp;quot;. This view is countered by
several discussants as being too narrow. Sparck Jones&apos;s
concept of discourse model is somewhat broader than
that of the other authors: She distinguishes between the
system&apos;s world model, its user model, its system model
(embodying, for example, its plans), and the system&apos;s
text model (containing linguistically characterized text-
based entities). The discourse model then, as defined by
Sparck Jones, would relate these four different models.
The question as to the relationship between user
models and discourse models has been answered by
most authors in a set-theoretical sense with respect to
whether or not contents are shared. That is, discussants
investigated whether &amp;quot;the UM contains items that are
missing from the DM; the DM contains items that are
missing from the UM; and [whether] the two share some
items&amp;quot; (Chin). Three different opinions were raised
with respect to this kind of relationship: that the dis-
course model is part of the user model (Schuster); that
the discourse model intersects the user model (Chin,
Monk; Kobsa: that it intersects, but is nearly included);
and that both models are separate, but still related to
each other (Cohen, Wahlster). A number of arguments,
counter-arguments, and illustrative examples are pro-
posed by the discussants to support their standpoints.
However, Kobsa, Monk, and Wahlster claim that the
relationship between user models and discourse models
cannot solely be regarded from the point of view of the
&amp;quot;contents being shared&amp;quot;. Kobsa argues that &amp;quot;exten-
sionally overlapping notions may still prove useful if
their intension highlights different aspects of a system&amp;quot;.
He is skeptical, however, as to whether useful differen-
tial criteria can be found for separating user models
from discourse models.
The aim of the preceding paragraphs was to outline
basic common and divergent opinions, and thereby to
provide a road map through the discussion. However,
readers should bear in mind that it is somewhat proble-
matic to summarize a discussion if one also participated
in it oneself. The summary might easily turn into yet
another position statement. Thus the preceding analysis
should be regarded with caution.
The discussion will start with a summary of
Schuster&apos;s position as presented at the user modeling
meeting in Maria Laach. Then the other contributions
follow in alphabetical order. In all papers, references to
other position statements will be made by citing the
name of the author only.
Finally, some information about the contributors:
David N. Chin is assistant professor of information
and computer sciences at the University of Hawaii at
Manoa. He conducted his Ph.D. studies at the Univer-
sity of California at Berkeley, where he worked on
treating UC—the UNIX Consultant—as an intelligent
agent that has its own goals, plans, and model of the
user.
Robin Cohen completed her Ph.D. at the University
of Toronto and has been assistant professor of computer
science at the University of Waterloo since 1984. Her
primary research interests are the development of prag-
matic models for the analysis of discourse, and the
application of these models to the design of user-
specific interfaces to expert systems.
Alfred Kobsa is a project coordinator of the XTRA
project in the German Special Collaborative Research
Programme on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge-
Based Systems at the University of Saarbrikken, W.
Germany. He is concerned with knowledge representa-
tion aspects and the development of a user model for the
XTRA natural-language access system to expert sys-
tems. In his previous Ph.D. work at the University of
Vienna, Austria, he developed the VIE-DPM user mod-
eling system for the VIE-LANG natural language sys-
tem.
Katharina Monk is internal project leader of the
KIT-Lerner project at the Technical University of Ber-
lin, working in the fields of knowledge acquisition and
machine learning. She completed her Ph.D. thesis on
belief systems and natural language understanding at
the University of Hamburg in 1981. From 1982 to 1984,
she worked on the Hamburg Application Oriented Nat-
ural Language System (HAM-ANS) with special em-
phasis being placed on user modeling and dialog strat-
egy.
Ethel Schuster is a graduate student in the Depart-
ment of Computer and Information Science at the
University of Pennsylvania. For her dissertation, she is
currently working on problems of reference to events
and actions. She received her M.S.E. in computer and
