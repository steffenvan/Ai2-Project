The problem of proposing referents for anaphoric expressions has been extensively researched in
the literature and significant insights have been gained through the various approaches. However,
no single model is capable of handling all the cases. We argue that this is due to a failure of the
models to identify two distinct processes. Drawing on current insights and empirical data from
various languages we propose an aposynthetic1 model of discourse in which topic continuity,
computed across units, and focusing preferences internal to these units are subject to different
mechanisms. The observed focusing preferences across the units (i.e., intersententially) are best
modeled structurally, along the lines suggested in centering theory. The focusing mechanism
within the unit is subject to preferences projected by the semantics of the verbs and the connectives
in the unit as suggested in semantic/pragmatic focusing accounts. We show that this distinction
not only overcomes important problems in anaphora resolution but also reconciles seemingly
contradictory experimental results reported in the literature. We specify a model of anaphora
resolution that interleaves the two mechanisms. We test the central hypotheses of the proposed
model with an experimental study in English and a corpus-based study in Greek.

1. The Problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999685285714286">
Extensive research reported in the anaphora resolution literature has focused on the
problem of proposing referents for pronominals.2 First, centering, formulated as a
model of the relationship between attentional state and form of referring expressions,
was utilized as the basis of an algorithm for binding pronominals on the intersen-
tential level (Brennan, Walker-Friedman, and Pollard 1987). The proposed algorithm
(henceforth the BFP algorithm) gives the correct interpretation for the pronominal he
in example (1), stating a preference to resolve the pronominal to Max rather than Fred.

It was soon observed, however, that the BFP algorithm was not capable of handling
cases of intrasentential anaphora such as in (2) (adapted from Suri, McCoy, and De-
Cristofaro [1999]).

The centering-based BFP algorithm would have a preference to resolve he in (2d) to
Dodge and not to the ex-convict, based on a preference for a Continue transition.
Alternative approaches to anaphora resolution have sought to account for the re-
solution facts by proposing a semantic/pragmatic rather than structural mechanism.
Stevenson et al. (2000) argue that both verbs and connectives have focusing proper-
ties affecting the preferred interpretation of pronominals. So in (3), the verb focusing
highlights Bill, since Bill is the person associated with the endpoint of the event of crit-
icizing. The connective, so, directs attention to the consequences and hence reinforces
the focus on Bill.

The semantic/pragmatic focusing account runs into the type of problem demon-
strated in (4), where the preferred interpretation for he is John, that is, the structural
subject, independent of semantic/pragmatic factors.3 In such discourses it seems that
a structural account is at play (in the sense of Grosz and Sidner [1986]).
(4) a. John criticized Bill.
b. Next, he insulted Susan.
This article sets out to explicate the behavior of pronominals demonstrated in the
above examples. Gaining significant insights from current research in anaphora reso-
lution, we reconcile what seem to be contradictory findings in a model according to
which inter- and intrasentential anaphora are not subject to the same mechanism. We
argue that the shortcomings of the proposed algorithms are due to confounding two
distinct processes, namely, topic continuity and the internal structure of the sentence.4
We conclude that intersentential anaphora is subject to structural constraints, whereas
intrasentential anaphora is subject to grammatical as well as semantic/pragmatic con-
straints. We define the notion of discourse unit and propose a two-level approach to
anaphora resolution. Within the unit, anaphora resolution is performed locally and is
constrained by the grammar and semantic properties of the predicates and the subor-
dinate conjunctions. This process outputs unresolved anaphoric expressions for which
potential referents are picked from a centering-style ranked list of entities constructed
in the previous unit.

4 We use the term “topic” to describe a centered entity, that is, the entity that the discourse is “about.”
The notion of a centered entity is a discourse construct distinct from “topic” or “theme” as defined in
information structure. Elsewhere we have introduced the term “attention structure in discourse” to
describe mechanisms, linguistic or nonlinguistic, that language users employ to navigate the hearer’s
attention in discourse. Topic continuity is derivative of attention structure in discourse. In this article,
however, we have opted for the more transparent term “topic continuity,” as it describes the
phenomenon we are mostly concerned with in pretheoretical terms.

centering-based models of anaphora resolution, discuss their shortcomings, and con-

Section 3, we present the discourse model we adopt and the specifications we propose

the central hypotheses of the proposed model in two studies: an experimental study
in English and a corpus-based study in Greek. We conclude with a general discussion

2.1 The BFP Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993102666666667">
Brennan, Walker-Friedman, and Pollard (1987) were the first to use the centering model
as the basis for an anaphora resolution algorithm. The centering model (Grosz and
Sidner 1986; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) makes the following assumptions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999326857142857">
1. A discourse segment consists of a sequence of utterances, U1, ... , Un.
2. For each utterance, a ranked list of evoked discourse entities is
constructed, designated as the Cf list.
3. The highest-ranked element of the Cf list is called the preferred center
(Cp).
4. The highest-ranked entity in the Cf list of Ui_1 realized in Ui is the
backward-looking center (Cb).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999444">
There are several types of topic transitions from one utterance to the next depending
on whether the Cb is retained over two consecutive utterances Un_1 and Un and
whether this Cb is also the Cp of Un (see Table 1). The distinction between a Smooth
Shift and a Rough Shift is due to Brennan, Walker-Friedman, and Pollard (1987), who
observed that the centering model generates ambiguity in cases such as (5):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98968025">
(5) a. Brennan drives an Alfa Romeo.
b. She drives too fast.
c. Friedman races her on weekends.
d. She often beats her.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993713">
Adding weight to the status of the Cp in (5c) makes it possible to resolve the pronom-
inal she in (5d) successfully to Friedman. We will return to the issue of ambiguity
shortly.
The BFP algorithm consists of three basic steps:

<listItem confidence="0.9955532">
1. Generate possible Cb-Cf combinations.
2. Filter by constraints (e.g., contra-indexing, sortal predicates, centering
rules and constraints).

Rough Shift).

Some of the shortcomings of the BFP algorithm are discussed by Prasad and Strube
(2000), who observe that it makes two strategic errors. Prasad and Strube’s observa-
tions are made with respect to Hindi but hold in English and Modern Greek, as shown
in (6) and (7), respectively.
The first of these errors occurs in cases in which Cb(Ui_1) is different from
Cp(Ui_1). In such cases, the preference for a Continue transition is responsible for
the pronominal in Ui being resolved to the Cb(Ui_1) and not to the Cp(Ui_1).

NULL took the friends her and NULL left.
Shej took herj friends and left.
There is an important observation to be made here, which we present as the first
indication for the distinction between topic continuity and anaphora resolution. On
the one hand, the BFP centering-based algorithm makes a resolution error opting for
a Continue transition in (6c) and (7c). On the other hand, anaphora aside, the topic
transition identified by centering is intuitively correct. In (6) and (7), the discourse is
initiated with Ellen as the current topic, Maria is introduced as an entity related to the
current topic, and then the discourse shifts to Maria to elaborate on her doings. The
shift is in fact anticipated by the promotion of Maria from the object position in (6a)
and (7a) to the subject position in (6b) and (7b).
The second error observed by Prasad and Strube (2000) is that the BFP algorithm
generates ambiguity when Ui_1 is discourse initial. Example (8) is given as illustration.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999269333333333">
Given that the Cb in the discourse initial (8a) is unspecified, Continue transitions are
generated when resolving his to either John or George. At this point, the BFP algorithm
is not capable of reaching a decision.

<bodyText confidence="0.999989043478261">
The solution we propose for the two problems is simple: the preferred antecedent
for the pronominal in Ui is the highest-ranked entity in Ui_1 that is compatible with
the anaphoric expression. Compatibility is defined in terms of agreement features
(number and gender in the case of English). The proposed solution is consistent with
the centering model. The most relevant centering notion for anaphora resolution is
the pronoun rule, which stipulates that if an entity is realized as a pronoun, then so
is the Cb. Opting for resolution to the highest-ranked entity in the previous entity is
precisely supported by the pronoun rule because the highest-ranked entity realized
in the following utterance is the Cb. On the other hand, using centering transitions
for anaphora resolution does not necessarily follow from the original formulation of
centering. Centering transitions, as originally formulated and as confirmed by the data
discussed above, are best at identifying degrees of topic continuity. There is no a pri-
ori reason to expect that they will perform equally well in identifying pronominal
referents. This is because assuming maximal coherence (preference for Continue tran-
sitions) overlooks properties of attention structure in discourse: strategies that hearers
use to signal attention shifts to new centers while maintaining coherence. A Smooth
Shift may be intended and signaled appropriately by, for example, promoting a proper
name from object to subject position. Interpreting pronominals in accordance with the
pronoun rule as suggested here exploits precisely such strategies.
We conclude from this section that although centering transitions successfully
identify topic continuity in discourse, in anaphora resolution the most useful centering
notion is not the transitions themselves but the Cf list ranking in combination with
the pronoun rule.

2.2 Functional Centering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9054612">
Strube and Hahn (1996, 1999) elaborate on the nature of the Cf list and propose a
centering-based model of anaphora resolution in which the Cf ranking is based not
on grammatical function but on functional information status. They recast centering
notions in terms of Daneˆs’s (1974) trichotomy between given information, theme, and
new information. The Cb(Ui), the most highly ranked element of Cf(Ui_1) realized in
Ui, corresponds to the element that represents given information. The Cp(Ui) corre-
sponds to the theme of Ui. The rhematic elements of Ui are the ones not contained
in Ui_1. Although the original motivation for the functional recast of centering was
due to German, a free-word-order language, Strube and Hahn (1996) claim that the
functional framework is superior because fixed- and free-word-order languages can
be accounted for using the same principles. They argue against Walker, Iida, and Cote
(1994), in which the Cf ranking is viewed as a language-specific parameter that needs
to be set.
In what follows we will remain agnostic to the suitability of the functional center-
ing framework for German. We will show, however, that functional centering is not
the appropriate framework for all free-word-order languages, much less for languages
universally. We bring in evidence from Modern Greek, a free-word-order language.
To identify the factors determining Cf ranking in Greek, we employ Rambow’s
(1993) diagnostic5 to test whether surface word order or grammatical function is the
most reliable indicator of salience. The relevant examples for the Greek version of
5 Rambow suggests that the order of entities in the position between finite and nonfinite verbs in
German (Mittelfeld) affects their salience. Gender in German is grammaticized, so Rambow constructs
an example with two same-gender entities in Mittelfeld and uses an ambiguous pronoun in subsequent
discourse to determine which of the two entities is more salient. The constructed example is given
below. “Fem” indicates that the noun phrases are gender marked “feminine.”

Rambow’s diagnostic are shown in (9) and (10). The null pronominal in (9b) and (10b)
resolves to the subject irrespective of its surface position.6 The relevant indicator of
salience in the Cf list appears to be grammatical function, at least subjecthood.7
(9) a. I prosfati diefthetisii veltioni tin ikonomiki politikij?
the recent arrangement improve the economic policy?
Does the recent arrangementi improve the economic policyj?
b. Ohi, (nulli) ine aneparkis.
No, (it) is inadequate.
No, iti is inadequate.

the economic policy it-(clitic) improve the recent arrangement?
Does the recent arrangementi improve the economic policyj?
b. Ohi, (nulli) ine aneparkis.
No, (it) is inadequate.
No, iti is inadequate.
Further evidence for the role of grammatical function in Greek comes from syntac-
tic objects.8 In Greek (and also in Turkish), a strong pronominal or a full noun phrase
(NP) must be used to promote the object of Ui−1 to the subject position of Ui.9 As the
infelicitous interpretations (indicated by the pound sign) show in (11b), reference to
the object Yorgo becomes felicitous only with the use of name repetition or a strong

6 Gender and lexical considerations are controlled. Both economical policy and arrangement are feminine
and they can both be inadequate. Also, we have presented the diagnostic test and confirmed the
judgment with a sizable group of native speakers of Greek attending the 15th International Symposium
on Theoretical and Applied Linguistics (Miltsakaki 2001).
7 It is interesting that in Turkish, another free-word-order language, it has also been shown (Turan 1998)
that the strongest indicator of salience is subjecthood.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9497175">
8 Greek has two pronominal systems: weak pronouns that must cliticize to the verb and strong pronouns
that are syntactically similar to full NPs. Dropped subjects are considered part of the system of weak
pronouns. In Miltsakaki (2000), we argue that speakers of various languages use available nominal and
pronominal forms and prosodic features in spoken language to signal attention structure in discourse.
Greek speakers with a three-way distinction in their nominal system (i.e., full noun phrases and weak
and strong pronominals) use strong pronominals to signal reference to an entity previously evoked in
discourse that is not, however, the most salient entity. This use of strong pronominals is equivalent to
certain prosodic effects in English. As noted by an anonymous reviewer, there is extensive literature on
the effects of prosody in pronominal interpretation. For example, it has been observed that prominent
stress on the pronominals in (1) yields cospecification of he with Bill and him with John.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.673521">
(1) John criticized Bill. Then, HE criticized HIM.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8818875">
The need to recruit special prosody to achieve resolution to Bill indicates that structural focusing is
indeed at work projecting strong “default” focusing preferences. In (1), there is sufficient semantic
information to help the hearer arrive at the intended interpretation. If there was no default
interpretation available at hand there would be no need to evoke prosodic effects. Once the linguistic
encoding of speakers’ strategies for building attention structure in discourse are identified,
incorporating them in the centering framework should be trivial.

rank lower than subjects in Greek.

d. Ekinosj tui prosfere ena poto.

HEj offered himi a drink.
Finally, to test the current results against the functional centering alternative, we
replace the definite subject in (9) with an indefinite noun phrase. As shown in (12),
the subject is an indefinite noun phrase representing new (or hearer-new) information
and the object is a definite phrase, encoding old (or hearer-old) information. The null
pronominal in (12b) resolves to the subject of (12a), and the information status of the
potential antecedents is disregarded.
(12) a. Mia kainourgia diefthetisii tha veltiosi tin ikonomiki politikij?
a new arrangement will improve the economic policy?
Will a new arrangementi improve the economic policyj?
b. Ohi, (nulli) tha ine aneparkis.
No, (it) will be inadequate.
No, it will be inadequate.
That the information status is not the relevant factor in discourse salience, at least
not cross-linguistically, is also confirmed in Turan (1998) for Turkish and in Prasad and
Strube (2000) for Hindi. In both of these languages, the relevant factor for the ranking
of elements in the Cf list is grammatical function.
We conclude that information status (or hearer status) is not universally the most
important factor determining discourse salience (in Cf ranking). Given the facts of
pronominalization, we maintain that, at least for English, Greek, Hindi, and Turkish,
grammatical function can most reliably determine the relative salience of entities.

10 Empirical evidence for the use of strong pronominals to signal reference to nonsalient entities in Greek
is provided in Dimitriadis (1996). Further functions of strong pronominals in Greek are identified in

2.3 The S-list Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935521739131">
A further modification of the centering model is proposed by Strube (1998), who re-
places the functions of the backward-looking center and the centering transitions with
the ordering among elements of what he calls the S-list, that is, the list of salient
discourse entities. The S-list ranking criteria define a preference for hearer-old over
hearer-new discourse entities and are intended to reflect the attentional state of the
hearer at any given point in discourse processing. The S-list is generated incremen-
tally and is updated every time an anaphoric element is resolved. Anaphoric elements
are resolved with a lookup in the S-list. The elements of the S-list are looked up for
compatibility in the order determined by their information status ranking (hearer-old
entities are looked up before hearer-new entities). When the analysis of the utterance
is finished (processed left to right), the discourse entities that are not realized in the
utterance are removed. Strube (1998) claims that the incremental generation and pro-
cessing of the S-list enables his system to handle inter- and intrasentential anaphora
without any further specifications.
Although the S-list has the merit of avoiding ambiguities caused by the way the
Cb and the centering transitions interact, it is not capable of handling intrasentential
anaphora without any further specifications, as claimed in Strube (1998). Stevenson et
al. (2000) report experimental results pointing out cases in which focus preferences are
projected by verbs and connectives. Neither a grammatical function ordering nor an
information-based ordering is adequate to handle such cases. To illustrate the point,
we quote an example, shown in (13), from Stevenson et al. (2000). We construct the S-
list ranking the elements according to grammatical function (information status would
not distinguish between the two proper names).11

In both (13a) and (13b) the pronominal resolves to Geoff, the verb argument with
the stimulus role. The ordering in the S-list in (13a), however, is Ken &gt; Geoff, so the
S-list algorithm will resolve the subsequent pronominal to the higher-ranked element
at the time of processing, in this case, Ken. In fairness to the S-list algorithm, this is
a problem for any centering-based algorithm that attempts to handle intrasentential
anaphora according to a fixed ranking of entities in a salience list.12
Apparently, certain discourse algorithms relying on a fixed ordering of potential
antecedents are not capable of resolving anaphora successfully. In sections 4 and 5, we
argue that such cases are most commonly identified intrasententially.

Although the prefer-SX hypothesis repairs the algorithm with respect to the con-

observed within versus across sentences. We return to this issue in Section 4.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999725">
Stevenson et al. (2000) investigate the interaction between structural, thematic, and re-
lational preferences in interpreting pronouns and connectives in discourse. Stevenson,
Crawley, and Kleinman (1994) have argued that the crucial factors underlying fo-
cusing mechanisms in discourse are semantic/pragmatic factors. Semantic/pragmatic
focusing assumes that verbs and connectives project their own focusing preferences.
Verbs project focus preferences to the entities associated with the endpoint or con-
sequence of the described event. The focusing preferences of the connective depend
on its meaning. For example, connectives like because direct attention to the cause of
the previously described event, and connectives like so direct attention to the conse-
quences of the event. Thus in a sentence like (17), the verb projects a focus preference
for Bill, because Bill is the person associated with the endpoint of the event of criti-
cizing. The connective, so, directs attention to the consequences, reinforcing the focus
on Bill, which is then picked as the most preferred antecedent for the interpretation
of the subsequent pronominal.

<bodyText confidence="0.999142125">
By way of demonstration, let us turn our attention to action and state verbs.
The semantic/pragmatic focusing account predicts that sentences with action verbs
focus on the entity associated with the endpoint of the event, namely, the patient,
independent of its structural position. This focus is maintained when the connective
is so. In one of Stevenson et al.’s (2000) experiments, it is shown that in cases such
as (18a) the pronominal he picks the patient as its referent both when it is introduced
in the previous clause as a subject and when it is introduced there as an object, as
in (18b).

A similar pattern is observed with state verbs, shown in (19), where he in the con-
tinuation is interpreted as the experiencer of the event independent of its structural
position.

So the experimental evidence supports Stevenson et al.’s view that the focusing prop-
erties of verbs affect the interpretation of pronominals.
Hudson-D’Zmura and Tanenhaus (1998), however, report experimental results
that, at first blush, contradict this view. They conducted a similar experiment to test
whether subject-object or stimulus-experiencer is the crucial distinction for pronom-
inal interpretation. Subjects were given sentence (20) followed by the continuations
(20a)–(20b) and were asked to judge the continuations for naturalness.

<bodyText confidence="0.9281884">
Hudson-D’Zmura and Tanenhaus’s results show that there is a strong preference for
the subject interpretation independent of the thematic role.
What are we to conclude from these inconsistent results? The results show that the
same type of verb (i.e., a state verb) in some cases projects its own focus preference
(e.g., experiencer), but in other cases it does not. In order to account for the facts, one
option would be to continue stretching structural focusing to account for the facts.
Another option would be to continue stretching semantic focusing. In the following
section, we propose an aposynthetic model for anaphora resolution in which we divide
the labor of anaphoric interpretation between the two mechanisms and define the
domains of their applicability.

3.1 Outline of the Discourse Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999402">
We assume that the discourse is organized hierarchically in linear and embedded
segments as specified in Grosz and Sidner (1986). We also adopt the centering view
of local-discourse coherence to model topic continuity in discourse. According to the
centering model each segment consists of a sequence of utterances. The size of an utter-
ance, however, is left unspecified. Because transitions are computed for each utterance,
we will rename utterances as centering update units and argue that a centering update
unit consists of a matrix clause and all the dependent clauses associated with it. For
each update unit a list of forward-looking centers is constructed and ranked according
to the salience of each. Consistent with the proposed definition of unit, we argue that
entities evoked in subordinate clauses are of lower salience than entities evoked in the
matrix clause and are ranked accordingly. The proposed centering specifications have
the following corollaries:

<footnote confidence="0.9131145">
1. The linear order of subordinate clauses relative to the matrix clause does
not affect the salience status of the entities.

2. Entities evoked in subordinate clauses are available as potential links
between the current and previous or subsequent discourse.
3. Topic shifts must be established in matrix clauses.
4. Backward anaphora in subordinate clauses is no longer “backward,” as
anaphors in subordinate clauses are processed before main clauses
independent of their linear order.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996115107142857">
Finally, we assume that anaphora across units obeys centering’s pronoun rule. How-
ever, we do not adopt the BFP algorithm for anaphora resolution across units. Instead,
as suggested in Section 2.1, the preferred antecedent for a pronominal in Ui is the
highest-ranked entity in Ui−1 modulo agreement features.
The remainder of this section is organized as follows. First, we briefly review
Kameyama’s tensed adjunct hypothesis, which states that subordinate clauses are in-
dependent processing units and argue that on the basis of new empirical evidence the
hypothesis cannot be maintained. Next, we present evidence in support of a new def-
inition of the update unit. Data from English, Greek, and Japanese show that treating
subordinate clauses as independent units yields counterintuitive centering transitions
and violations of the pronoun rule.
3.1.1 The Centering Update Unit. Defining the update unit within the framework
of the centering model became central in very early work, because centering was
adopted and modified mainly to account for anaphora resolution. Given that anaphoric
elements occur in all types of clauses, it was crucial that the size of the update unit
be constrained to enable the handling of intrasentential anaphora. To a large extent,
efforts to identify the appropriate size for the unit were often dictated by needs specific
to anaphora resolution algorithms.
Centering was not originally formulated, however, as a model of anaphora resolu-
tion. For purposes of testing the suitability of the relevant unit in centering, it would
be desirable to derive a model that yields transitions that reflect our intuitions about
perceived discourse coherence, as well as the degree of the processing load required
by the hearer/reader at any given time in discourse processing. Reflecting degrees of
continuity is not a concern for anaphora resolution algorithms.
Kameyama (1993, 1998) was concerned with the problem of intrasentential cen-
tering and, in particular, the definition of the appropriate update unit when complex
sentences are processed. Kameyama suggested breaking up complex sentences accord-
ing to the following hypotheses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.926677">
1. Conjoined and adjoined tensed clauses form independent units.
2. Tenseless subordinate clauses, report complements, and relative clauses
belong to the update unit containing the matrix clause.

<bodyText confidence="0.997597333333333">
With regard to her tensed adjunct hypothesis, which treated tensed adjunct clauses (for
reasons of convenience, we will henceforth use the term “subordinate” to refer to this
class of clauses) as independent units, Kameyama brings in support from backward
anaphora. She argues that the tensed adjunct hypothesis predicts that the pronoun in
the fronted subordinate clause in (21c), for example, is anaphorically dependent on
an entity already introduced in the immediate discourse and not on the subject of the

<bodyText confidence="0.974409142857143">
This view of backward anaphora, in fact, was strongly professed by Kuno (1972),
who asserted that there was no genuine backward anaphora: the referent of an ap-
parent cataphoric pronoun must appear in the previous discourse. Kameyama’s (also
Kuno’s) argument is weak in two respects. First, it is not empirically tested that in
cases of backward anaphora the antecedent is found in the immediate discourse.
Carden (1982) and van Hoek (1997) provide empirical evidence of pronouns that
are the first mention of their referent in discourse. Most recently, Tanaka (2000) re-
ported that in the cataphora data retrieved from the Anaphoric Treebank, out of
133 total occurrences of personal pronouns encoded as “cataphoric,” 47 (35.3%) were
“first mentioned.” Among the 47 cases of first-mention cataphora, 6 instances were
discourse initial.13
Secondly, this account leaves the use of a full NP in Kameyama’s main clause
(21d) unexplained (Kern and Jim have the same referent). Full NPs and proper names
occurring in Continue transitions have been observed to signify a segment bound-
ary. Assuming that segment boundaries do not occur between a main clause and
a subordinate clause associated with it, the use of a full NP in (21d) remains
puzzling.
Empirical evidence in support of Kameyama’s hypothesis that tensed subordinate
clauses should be treated as independent processing units was brought forth by Di
Eugenio (1990, 1998), who carried out centering studies in Italian. Di Eugenio (1990)
proposed that the alternation of null and overt pronominal subjects in Italian could be
explained in terms of centering transitions. Typically, a null subject signals a Continue
and a strong pronoun a Retain or a Shift.14
Following Kameyama (1993), Di Eugenio treats subordinate clauses as indepen-
dent update units. Her motivation for doing so comes from the following example,
in which the use of a strong pronoun in the main clause cannot be explained if the
preceding adjunct is not treated as an independent update unit. The translation (taken
from Di Eugenio [1998]) is literal but not word for word. For the utterance preceding
(22) the Cb(Ui_1) = vicinaj (neighbor-fem) and Cf(Ui_1) = vicinaj.
13 The Anaphoric Treebank is a corpus of a collection of news reports, annotated with, among other
things, type of anaphoric relations. It was developed by UCREL (Unit for Computer Research on the
English Language) at Lancaster University, collaborating with the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.
14 Di Eugenio collapsed the distinction between Smooth and Rough Shifts. The reader is referred,
however, to Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000a, 2000b) for a discussion of the significance of Rough Shifts in
the evaluation of text coherence.

In Miltsakaki (2001), we report the results of a centering study in Greek. One
of the surprising findings in this study was that a few strong pronouns appeared
in Continue transitions. The result was surprising because the overall distribution of
nominal and pronominal forms revealed that weak pronouns were most common in
Continue transitions, whereas strong pronouns, full noun phrases, and proper nouns
were associated with Rough Shift transitions. On closer inspection, we observed that in
six out of the eight instances of strong pronouns in Continue transitions, the referent of
the strong pronoun was contrasted on some property with some other entity belonging
to a previously evoked set of entities.15 Although the sample is too small to draw any
definitive conclusions, we can at least entertain the hypothesis that strong pronouns
in Italian serve a similar function. If this is true, then an alternative explanation is
available for Di Eugenio’s data: in (22b), she, the most salient entity in the current
discourse, is contrasted with the lazy ones, in (22a), on the property of “laziness.” It
turns out that the hypothesis that the strong pronoun does not signal a Rough Shift
transition is confirmed by the preceding discourse, in which the “vicina” appears as the
most salient entity, realized with multiple dropped subjects. The discourse immediately
preceding (22) is shown in (23).16

We now turn to English and Greek to show that treating subordinate clauses as
independent centering units yields counterintuitive topic transitions. First, consider
the constructed example from English shown in (24).
15 We ignored one further instance of a strong pronominal in a Continue transition, as in that case the
strongpronominal headed a relative clause and its use was forced by the grammar.

Allowing the subordinate clause to function as a single update unit yields a sequence
of two Rough Shifts, which is diagnostic of a highly discontinuous discourse. Fur-
ther, if indeed there are two Rough Shift transitions in this discourse, the use of the
pronominal in the third unit is puzzling. A sequence of two Rough Shift transitions
in this short discourse is counterintuitive and unexpected given that of all centering
transitions, Rough Shifts in particular have been shown to (a) disfavor pronominal
reference (Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Di Eugenio 1998; and Miltsakaki 1999, among
others), (b) be rare in corpora, to the extent that the transition has been ignored by
some researchers (Di Eugenio 1998 and Hurewitz 1998, among others), and (c) be re-
liable measures of low coherence in student essays (Miltsakaki and Kukich 2000a). In
addition, simply reversing the order of the clauses, shown in (25), causes an unex-
pected improvement, with one Rough Shift transition being replaced with a Continue.
Assuming that the two discourses demonstrate a similar degree of continuity in the
topic structure (they are both about “John”), we would expect the transitions to reflect
this similarity when, in fact, they do not.
Presumably, the introduction of a new discourse entity, “meeting,” in the time-
clause does not interfere with discourse continuity, nor does it project a preference
for a shift of topic, as the Cp normally does when it instantiates an entity different
from the current Cb. Notice that if we process the subordinate clause in the same unit
as the relevant main clause, we compute a Continue transition independent of the
linear position of the subordinate clause, as the entities introduced in the main clause
rank higher than the entities introduced in the subordinate clause. The computation
is shown in (26).

Again, processing the while clause in (27b) as an independent unit yields three Rough
Shift transitions in the subsequent discourse, reflecting a highly discontinuous dis-
course. When (27b) and (27c) are processed as a single unit, the resulting sequence of
transitions for the entire discourse is a much improved Continue-Continue-Retain.
Further evidence in support of the proposed definition of the update unit comes
from cross-linguistic observations on anaphora resolution. The most striking examples
come from Japanese.17 In Japanese, topics and subjects are lexically marked (wa and
ga, respectively), and null subjects are allowed. Note that subordinate clauses must
precede the main clause. Consider the Japanese discourse (28). Crucially, the referent
of the null subject in the second main clause resolves to the topic-marked subject of the
first main clause, ignoring the subject-marked subject of the intermediate subordinate
clause.

In section 2.4, a similar case was also identified in English. It is repeated here as
(29d). Again, the referent of he in (29d) is cospecified with ex-convict, the subject of the
previous main clause. If the because clause were processed independently, then the
most salient referent available for the interpretation of the anaphoric in (29d) should
be Dodge. Manipulating the semantics in the second main clause to make resolution to
Dodge the most plausible choice does not seem sufficient to warrant felicitous pronomi-
nalization, as has been shown experimentally in Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro (1999),
demonstrated here in (30). In (30), he is not the preferred form for reference to Dodge
despite the fact that Dodge is the most natural referent for the argument of the predicate

Finally, defining the main clause and its associated subordinate clauses as a single
unit points to interesting new directions in understanding backward anaphora. With
the exception of a few modal contexts shown in (34),18 backward anaphora is most
commonly found in preposed subordinate clauses (32) and not in sequences of main
clauses (33). From the unit definition we propose, it follows that surface backward
anaphora is no longer “backward” once the Cf list is constructed and ranked. The
referent of the pronoun in such cases appears lower in the Cf list ranking and, in
fact, looks backward for an antecedent, as any other normal pronoun would. To illus-
trate the point, the Cf list for (32) contains John &gt; shower &gt; he-referent. The pronoun
looks back for an antecedent, intrasententially, and resolves to the only compatible
antecedent available, John.

argued that the linear position of the subordinate clause does not affect topic continuity.
This position leads to another question: if the linear position of subordinate clauses
does not improve topic continuity, then what is the function of clause order variation?
Let us briefly turn our attention to surface word order within a single clause. It is
commonly assumed that for each language there is an underlying canonical order of
the basic constituents. In an SVO language like Greek, the canonical order of the verb
and its arguments is subject-verb-object. This, of course, is not always the attested
surface order. In syntactic theories, it is commonly assumed that surface word order
is derived by various movement operations. Some movement operations are dictated
by the syntax of each language and are necessary to yield grammatical sentences. It
is also common, however, especially in free-word-order languages, that movement
is syntactically optional and the surface word order is used to satisfy information-
packaging needs (for example, to arrange the information into old-new or ground-
focus or mark open propositions). Note that when this happens, it is only the surface
word order that is altered and not the basic relation of the arguments to the predicate.
To give an example from English, in (35) the internal argument of the verb (the object)
has been fronted, but its original relation to the verb has remained the same.

<bodyText confidence="0.9996885">
Moving to the sentential level, we entertain the hypothesis that the same principle
dictates the position of the clauses relative to each other. Each dependent clause stands
in a specific relation to the main clause, and this relation is not altered by the order
in which the clause appears on the surface. In discourse grammars, this insight is
captured in the discourse Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) treatment of
subordinate conjunctions. In discourse LTAGs, subordinate conjunctions are treated
as predicates, anchoring initial trees containing the main and the subordinate clause
as arguments. Each subordinate conjunction may anchor a family of trees to reflect
variations in the surface order of the substituted argument clauses, but the predicate-
argument relation remains the same (Webber and Joshi 1998; Webber et al., 1999a,
1999b).
The above discussion relates to the definition of the centering update unit in the
following way. The centering model keeps track of center continuations and center
shifts. In other words, it keeps track of discourse salience. If we dissociate salience
from information structure, the relevant unit for computing salience is at the sentence
level, which we can visualize as a horizontal level (see Figure 1). The relative order of
independent/dependent clauses is determined by information structuring, a process
possibly orthogonal to the computing of salience. Subordinate links are not relevant
to the salience mechanism. Salience is computed paratactically.
A natural consequence of this model is that one can introduce referents on the
vertical level without affecting the status of the salient entity on the horizontal level.
It follows that changes of topic must be established at the horizontal level. Such a
conception of the salience structure suggests that text processing is not strictly incre-
mental, as commonly assumed. Although it is possible that the Cf list is constructed
incrementally, the final ranking is determined only after the sentence is complete.
Admittedly, the distinction between discourse salience and information packaging
is hard to establish because of the inevitable overlap between information status and
salience: attention centers, for example, tend to be discourse old. Still, there are other
aspects of information packaging pertaining to clause order (e.g., temporal or logical
sequences, open proposition frames inherited from previous discourse) that do not

necessarily relate to the salience of the participating entities. Although a great deal
of additional work is required to understand the precise nature of the interaction
between salience and information structure, we believe that we obtain a significant
gain in keeping the two processes distinct.

3.2 Outline of the Anaphora Resolution Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985296296296">
In Sections 2 and 3, we discussed a number of challenging cases for anaphora res-
olution, including some puzzling experimental data. We raised the question of how
the data are to be reconciled. We are now able to offer an explanation. The basic
idea is that topic continuity and intrasentential anaphora are handled by two distinct
mechanisms. Topic continuity is computed across centering update units. Anaphoric
reference spanning across update units relates to topic continuity and is therefore de-
termined structurally in accordance with centering rules and constraints. Within the
unit, anaphora is constrained by focusing preferences projected by the matrix predi-
cate and the extended arguments of the predicate that can be locally realized through
subordination.
This basic outline is sufficient to explain (most of) the data we have seen so far. The
experiments reported in Stevenson et al. (2000), which show a main effect of thematic
focusing, involve the interpretation of anaphoric expressions in subordinate clauses.
On the other hand, Hudson-D’Zmura and Tanenhaus’s (1998) experiments on similar
types of verbs show a main effect of structural focusing. The difference between the
two sets of experiments is that Hudson-D’Zmura and Tanenhaus’s (1998) experiments
involve sequences of main clauses, whereas in Stevenson et al. (2000) the relevant
experiments involve subordinate clauses. Furthermore, Stevenson et al. (2000) report
results on a different set of experiments showing a main effect of structural focusing,
and these are precisely the experiments containing sequences of main clauses. Further,
Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro’s (1999) “SX because SY” construction indicates that
the referent appearing in the subordinate clause is not the preferred focus in the
subsequent discourse, whereas resolution to the subject of the main SX clause yields
the desired interpretation.
The remainder of this section is organized as follows. First, we provide definitions
for the basic tenets of the model we propose and describe the basic steps required for
combining the two mechanisms in a single anaphora resolution algorithm. Next, we

discuss some remaining issues raised by the English connective so and certain types
of preposed subordinate clauses.
3.2.1 Algorithm and Model Specifications. Discourse consists of a sequence of seg-
ments. Each segment consists of a sequence of centering update units. A single center-
ing update unit consists of one main clause and all its associated dependent clauses.
Dependent clauses are of three types: sentential complements of verbs, relative clauses,
and subordinate clauses. Sentential complements of verbs and relative clauses are iden-
tified syntactically. Subordinate clauses are introduced with subordinate conjunctions.
To identify subordinate conjunctions, we apply the reversibility test: a tensed clause
is introduced by a subordinator when the clause it introduces can be preposed.19
For example, in (36), although is classified as a subordinator and the although clause
is classified as a subordinate clause because placing the although clause before the
main clause retains grammaticality. Conversely, however in (38) is not classified as a
subordinator, because preposing the clause with which it is associated yields ungram-
maticality.

Update units are identified and numbered. For each identified update unit the list
of forward-looking centers is constructed and its members are ranked according to
the ranking rule for English. The “M” prefix stands for “main clause,” and the “S”
prefix stands for “subordinate clause.” The relevant ranking of the various types of
dependent clauses is currently left unspecified.

For complex NPs, we assume left-to-right ranking of entities, as suggested in Walker
and Prince (1996).20
Given the above input for N units, Ui=1 ...N, the anaphora resolution algorithm
starts at the last identified unit. The basic steps are specified below. Some of the steps
require information that is obtainable by currently available natural language systems:
syntactic parsers, morphological analyzers, automated proper name identification, and
electronic lexical databases such as WordNet (to check animacy, for example, as would
be necessary for the ranking of entities in Greek). Others, such as understanding the
focusing preferences of verbs and connectives as well as identifying thematic roles

3.3 Comparison with Related Algorithms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951">
The crucial difference between our approach and related anaphora resolution algo-
rithms is in the treatment of subordinate clauses. Whereas steps 7–10 are similar to
other approaches that opt to resolve a pronoun to the highest-ranked element of the
Cf list of the previous clause, the resolution process described in steps 0–7 and the
Cf ranking assumptions described earlier are not. As indicated in the ranking rule
for English set forth in Section 3.2.1, (a) subordinate clauses are part of the same unit
containing the main clause with which they are associated, and (b) there is a single Cf
ranking list for both the main and the subordinate clauses. Because the entities in the
subordinate clauses rank lower than the entities in the main clause, the linear position
of the subordinate clause does not affect the resolution process. We have seen that this
“restoring” of a basic clause order results in virtually eliminating backward anaphora,
which in other approaches requires special treatment.21 Also, intrasentential anaphora
is preferred in the cases of anaphoric elements occurring in subordinate clauses but
not in main clauses (assuming grammatical filtering), again irrespective of their linear
order.
We will now demonstrate these differences with respect to Lappin and Leass’s
(1994) and Hobbs’s (1978) algorithms, which are conceptually the closest to our ap-
proach. Lappin and Leass’s RAP (Resolution of Anaphora Procedure) algorithm ap-
plies to the output of McCord’s (1990) Slot Grammar parser and utilizes measures of
salience derived from syntactic structure and a simple model of attentional state. Po-
tential anaphor antecedents receive a salience score on which they are evaluated. The
scoring system penalizes backward anaphora and rewards parallel syntactic positions
and intrasentential antecedents (sentence recency).
As we have already mentioned, backward anaphora need not receive any special
treatment in our approach. Lappin and Leass penalize cases of backward anaphora
severely, which seems to work well on empirical grounds, presumably because back-
ward anaphora is rather rare. In absence of an explicit method of identifying real
cases of backward anaphora, however, the system is likely to miss such cases. In our

approach, this is not a problem, because the Cf ranking of the processing unit im-
plicitly identifies all real cases of backward anaphora and converts them into forward
anaphora.
Further, some of the limitations of the system discussed by Lappin and Leass
involve cases of intersentential anaphora such as the following:
(43) a. This green indicator is lit when the controller is on.
b. It shows that the DC power supply voltages are at the correct levels.
The RAP algorithm resolves the pronoun it in (43b) to the controller in (43a). This is
because, in RAP, the subject of the main as well as the when clause in (43a) are of equal
salience. In this case, the controller wins because it is more recent. In our approach, it
would resolve to the highest-ranked entity of the previous unit, which in this case is
correctly identified as the green indicator. This is because the when clause is not treated
as an independent unit. The entities evoked in the when clause are linearly but not
structurally more recent.
Hobbs’s (1978) syntactic algorithm is based on a well-defined search procedure
(left-to-right in most cases, breadth-first) applied on the surface parse tree. The al-
gorithm has three main components. The first component treats reflexive pronouns
by constraining the search procedure with special configurational requirements. The
second component takes over when the antecedent of an anaphor is to be found in
previous sentences, and the third component searches subparts of the parse tree in
cycles until the highest clause is reached.
Intersententially, Hobbs’s syntactic algorithm favors subjects over objects, as sub-
jects are higher up in the parse tree than objects. Intersententially, our approach and
Hobbs’s algorithm would opt for the same type of antecedent. As Lappin and Le-
ass (1994) have pointed out, however, the syntactic search procedure seems to work
pretty well in English because grammatical order corresponds to phrase order. For
other languages, either free-word-order languages like Greek or languages in which
salience is determined by other factors (e.g., information status, as has been argued for
German [Strube 1998]), Hobbs’s search procedure would fail, because it is too rigid to
accommodate linguistic variation in marking salience. Even for languages like English,
the relevant salience of entities may be undermined by nonsyntactic factors. As has
already been suggested by Turan (1998), among others, certain types of NPs are less
salient than others independent of their grammatical function (e.g., indefinite quan-
tified expressions and impersonal pronouns). The flexibility of constructing lists of
entities according to salience both optimizes the capabilities of an anaphora resolution
algorithm and is best suited to accommodate the multiplicity of factors that may have
to be taken into account in determining reference salience.
Hobbs’s algorithm is, in effect, similar to our approach in the treatment of subor-
dinate clauses. Subordinate clauses belong to the same parse tree as the main clause to
which they are subordinate. This is equivalent to our claim that subordinate clauses are
not independent processing units. With respect to backward anaphora, in particular,
Hobbs’s use of the “command” relation achieves the same result as our lower rank-
ing of entities appearing in subordinate clauses. The subject of a subordinate clause
would be lower in the parse tree than the subject of the main clause, independent
of the linear position of either. So, for example, in (44), the pronoun would correctly
resolve to Susan. In a case like (45), however, Hobbs’s algorithm would always resolve
the pronoun to Susan, since the search procedure has no way of making a distinc-
tion between different types of subordinate connectives (or verbs) and their effect on
reference salience.

3.4 Some Remaining Issues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999295142857143">
As mentioned above, the proposed model for anaphora resolution accounts comfort-
ably for the results reported in Stevenson et al. (2000) except, however, for the exper-
iment involving the connective so.
According to the reversibility test, so is classified as a subordinate conjunction
depending on its interpretation. In English, so denotes two relations: consequence and
purpose. The examples below indicate that only purpose-so behaves as a subordinate
conjunction. 22

<bodyText confidence="0.951142">
The anaphora resolution model we propose predicts that the interpretation of
pronouns in consequence-so sentences is determined structurally. This prediction was
not borne out. Stevenson et al. (2000) report a main effect of semantic focusing in
consequence-so continuations.
There are two options available to explain the data. First, we may hypothesize that
subordination is determined on structural grounds, in which case it is likely that lan-
guages may arbitrarily characterize their set of subordinate conjunctions. Under this
option, we may hypothesize that so in English is uniformly a subordinate conjunction
and then set out to investigate the implications of such a hypothesis on empirical
grounds. Alternatively, we may hypothesize that the crucial factor in characterizing
subordination is by its semantic properties, that is, the type of relation it establishes
with the proposition denoted in the main clause. This second option seems intuitively
appealing and more promising in explaining this otherwise puzzling linguistic phe-
nomenon, namely, the structural distinction between main and subordinate clauses. It
runs into the following problem, however.
In Modern Greek, the equivalent conjunction for the English so is etsi or ki etsi (_
‘and so’), which is not polysemous and is not a subordinate conjunction. Greek etsi
links clauses paratactically (i.e., links sequences of main clauses). The examples below
show that Greek behaves differently from English in the so cases.
(50) #I Mariai htipise tin Elenij, ki etsi NULLj evale ta klamata.
the Maria hit the Eleni and so she put the tears.
Mariai hit Elenij and so shej started crying.
(51) I Mariai xilokopithike apo tin Elenij ki etsi NULLi evale ta klamata.
the Maria was-hit by the Eleni and so she put the tears.
Mariai was hit by Elenij and so shei started crying.
22 Although in many cases preposing a purpose-so clause seems unnatural, at least for some native
speakers of English preposing of a purpose-so clause is possible, given the appropriate context. For all
native speakers we have consulted, there is a marked difference in the acceptability of (47) and (49).

The Modern Greek data show that the null subject in the so clause cannot be inter-
preted as the object of the previous clause. If subordination was to be defined on
semantic grounds, then we should not expect focusing differences between the two
languages, but in fact we do.
Finally, we notice that Greek is much like English when the second clause is linked
through other types of subordination, as shown in (52)–(53):
(52) I Mariai htipise tin Elenij giati NULLj ekane ataxies.
the Maria hit the Eleni because she did naughty-things
Mariai hit Elenij because shej was being naughty
(53) I Elenij xilokopithike apo ti Mariai giati NULLj ekane ataxies.
the Eleni was-hit by the Maria because she did naughty-things.
Elenij was hit by Mariai because shej was being naughty.
The reason for the difference between the two languages with respect to so clauses is
hard to explain. This difficulty in understanding the cross-linguistic variation is also
telling of our fundamental lack of understanding subordination in languages. In this
article, we do not claim to understand the intricacies of subordination any better. In
the next section, it is shown that the distinction between main and subordinate clauses
is in the right direction. It is not yet clear, however, what property of subordination—
structural, semantic or other—is responsible for the pattern we observe. We will leave
this issue open for future work.
Another issue that requires special attention in the proposed account pertains to
some special cases of preposed subordinate clauses. Example (54) presents a problem
for the proposed model because the antecedent of the subject pronoun in the matrix
clause is the subject of the preposed subordinate clause.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.925005">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998999">
The ranking in the Cf list for (54) is she-referent &gt; Susan &gt; Barbara. In effect, what
we are faced with here is analogous to backward anaphora. In its current form, how-
ever, the proposed algorithm would process the subordinate clause first and would
then move to the matrix clause. The matrix clause contains a pronoun and no pos-
sible antecedent, so on completing the processing of the unit, the algorithm would
output the unresolved pronoun from the matrix clause and would continue searching
for an antecedent in the previous unit. Such cases can be identified easily by even
shallow parsing and be fixed locally by forcing resolution to the highest entity in the
current unit (i.e., Susan). Also, as a reviewer has suggested, the algorithm presented
in Section 3.2.1 could be modified so that in step 2 the Cf list includes all possible
antecedents from the current utterance Ui. With this modification, (54) would be pro-
cessed correctly, but as the same reviewer points out, this does not explain the contrast
in (55):

anaphora, and there is no clear subject reference. Example (55c) is another instance
of intrasentential anaphora, but in this case the subject preference is clearly on a par
with the intersentential case in (55a). Whatever required modification to the algorithm
will prove to be more useful, the fact remains that the similarity between (55a) and
(55c) remains unexplained in purely structural terms. We suspect that the difference
between (55b) and (55c) and the similarity between (55a) and (55c) is the result of
an interaction with a discourse function of subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses
normally convey background information and do not by themselves move the nar-
rative forward. They also have the property of enabling information to appear in a
“nonnatural order” with respect to the event(s) of the main clause. A “natural order”
for temporal connections would be to express events in the order in which they hap-
pened. For causal connections, a natural order would be to express the cause before
the effect. So it seems plausible to hypothesize that subordinate structures can be used
to introduce background (or presupposed) information and even discourse-new char-
acters without disturbing the narrative structure of the discourse and the salience of
the centers of attention already established in the narrative. If this line of thinking
is on the right track, then it is possible that the similarity between (55a) and (55c) is
due to the fact that both sequences of clauses reflect the linear succession of events.
The preposed after-clause does not disturb the natural temporal order of events both
of which are predicated of the same center, which in this case is introduced in the
subordinate clause. Further empirical work is clearly needed to evaluate this line of
explanation.

4. Empirical Studies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985888888889">
In this section we report the results of two empirical studies designed specifically
to test the central hypotheses of the proposed model: (a) that anaphoric reference
that spans across centering update units is determined structurally (as specified in
Section 3.2.1) and (b) that subordinate clauses do not form independent processing
units. In the first study, in Section 4.1, we report the results of a sentence completion
experiment in English. We quantify over the interpretation of a subject pronoun to
one of two ambiguous antecedents evoked in the preceding clause. Two factors were
analyzed, type of clause and semantic type of connection, in four conditions. The re-
sults show a strong main effect for type of clause. In the main-clause conditions, the
subject pronoun resolved to the subject antecedent of the previous sentence. In the
subordinate-clause conditions, the interpretation of the subject pronoun was varied.
In the second study, we tested the same hypotheses on a Greek corpus. We selected
three types of subordinate clauses under conditions similar to the ones set in the ex-
perimental study. We contrasted anaphoric interpretation in subordinate clauses with
anaphoric interpretation in main clauses. The results provide strong evidence for the
accuracy of the centering-based algorithm proposed for anaphora resolution across
units. The results also confirm that anaphoric interpretation in subordinate clauses is
not determined structurally.

clause introduced two individuals of the same gender. The second clause contained
a subject pronoun of the same gender as the individuals introduced in the first main
clause. Participants were asked to complete the second clause. We were interested in
the interpretation of the subject pronominal in the second clause.
For this experiment, two subordinate conjunctions were selected from two se-
mantic classes, namely, time and contrast. Also, two adverbial conjunctions, then and
however, were selected from the same semantic classes to introduce the second clause
in the main-main conditions.
We predicted that the pronominal in the main clause would consistently be inter-
preted as the subject of the preceding main clause. We also predicted that the interpre-
tation of the subject pronoun in the subordinate clause would vary. In all critical items
the verb of the main clause belonged to the same category (see below), so any varia-
tion pattern observed across the two subordinate conjunctions would be attributed to
the focusing preferences projected by the semantics of the subordinate conjunctions.
The grouping of connectives into semantic types, namely, then, when for time and
however, although for contrast and structural types, then, however for main clauses and
when, although for subordinate clauses, enables us to compare and contrast the effect of
two factors: semantic type and type of clause. A main effect of semantic type would
mean that the interpretation of the subject pronoun is primarily determined by the
semantics of the connectives. Conversely, a main effect of type of clause would mean
that the interpretation of the subject pronominal is primarily determined by the type
of clause.
4.1.1 Study and Results. Sixteen adults, native speakers of English, participated in
the experiment. They were asked to perform a sentence completion task as described
in the previous section. Each participant received a form containing 36 fillers and 12
critical items, 6 per type of clause and 6 per semantic type. The example below demon-
strates a complete set of conditions; each form contained three such sets interspersed
with fillers. Each main clause appeared in all conditions across participants, and each
condition appeared three times within participants. The order of appearance of critical
items was varied in two LISTS (two variations in the order of appearance of critical
items).
a. The groom hit the best man violently. However, he... (contrast, main-main)
b. The groom hit the best man violently
although he... (contrast, main-subordinate)
c. The groom hit the best man violently. Then, he... (time, main-main)
d. The groom hit the best man violently when he... (time, main-subordinate)
All main clauses contained an action verb with two human arguments of the same
gender. An adverbial phrase was added at the end of the main clause to achieve nat-
uralness. The arguments of the verbs were always realized as role NPs to minimize
referential ambiguity in the continuations. In general, sentence continuation involv-
ing role NPs tends to disambiguate the intended reference. Nevertheless, an average
of two ambiguous continuations were identified per participant. On completing the
experiment, the participants were asked to identify explicitly the intended referent of
the ambiguous continuations.

darker grey columns show the distribution of the interpretation of the subordinate-
clause subject. For convenience, we labeled the main-main clause condition parataxis
and the main-subordinate clause condition hypotaxis.23
Analyses of variance revealed a strong main effect of type of CLAUSE: the pronoun
resolved to the subject of the previous clause significantly more often when it appeared
in a main clause (F = 74.16, df = 1,15,p &lt; .0001). Semantic type showed only a
marginal effect (F = 4.59, df = 1, 15, p &lt; .049).
With regard to the comparison based on the semantic similarity between how-
ever/although and then/when, it turned out that in several cases when clauses were
assigned a causal interpretation. For example, the when clause continuation in (56) is
interpreted as giving the cause of the event described in the preceding main clause,
rather than the time specification.
(56) The father shook the son vigorously when he saw him lying on the
ground.
For this reason, it was hard to pursue the semantic-based comparison between the
paratactic then and the hypotactic when, and we therefore did not make any further
analyses within the semantic-type factor. Since it would be hard to control the inter-
pretation of the connectives used in this type of experiment, in future experiments
we plan to give up on the effort to pair connectives semantically. Instead, we plan to

more reliably over the whole class of subordinate conjunctions.
4.1.2 Discussion. The results of this experiment show that structural focusing is promi-
nent across main clauses. The analyses of variance revealed a strong main effect for
the type of clause despite the fact that, in the experiment, we included main-clause
continuations introduced with however. Given the verb type in the first main clause,
we in fact stretched structural focusing to its limits, as it would be reasonable to expect
that the contrast relation established with however would shift attention to the second
individual. For example:
(57) The Popei tapped the priesty on the shoulder. However, hey ignored him.
Still, the results clearly indicate that the type of connection affects the interpretation
of the pronoun in the second main clause across, or despite, semantic types. Also, the
variation of pronominal reference across types of subordinate conjunctions indicates
that the interpretation of anaphoric expressions in subordinate clauses is determined
by other, apparently nonstructural, factors.24
Finally, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that structural focusing de-
termines the interpretation of pronominals across, but not within, processing units.
According to the discourse model suggested in Section 3.1, a main clause is an in-
dependent processing unit, so a sequence of main clauses constitutes a sequence of
units. On the other hand, a subordinate clause does not form an independent unit, so
a sequence containing a main and a subordinate clause is simply internal to the unit.
The reference variation observed in the subordinate conditions is then expected from
the model.
Unfortunately, in this experiment, we lost the contrast for the type of connection
within semantic types because of the noise created by the causal interpretation of
some when clauses. To enable the conclusions of this experiment to be generalized
across the entire classes of paratactic and hypotactic connectives, this experiment will
be repeated with a larger set of connectives.
An interesting extension of this work would be to investigate whether structural
focusing is active within units, before it is eventually overridden by semantic focusing,
or whether focusing preferences projected by the semantics of the verbs and connec-
tives are immediately accessed during on-line processing.

4.2 Corpus-Based Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897">
The corpus-based study reported in this section is based on a Greek corpus built with
text from Greek newspapers available on the Web. The corpus consists of approxi-
mately 800,000 words downloaded from the sites of the Greek newspapers Eleftherotipia
and To Vima.
The aim of the corpus study is similar to that of the experimental study reported
in the previous section. Greek allows dropped subjects, which yields higher referen-
tial ambiguity than English pronouns. We were therefore able to collect a reasonable
number of tokens fulfilling the conditions of the experimental study and to test our
hypotheses against naturally occurring data.

As in the experimental study, we wanted to compare and contrast the interpre-
tation of anaphoric expressions in a main clause with the interpretation of anaphoric
expressions in a subordinate clause. Unlike in the experimental study, however, the
search of anaphoric expressions in main and subordinate clauses was not restricted to
subject pronouns.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.554567">
4.2.1 Data Collection and Coding. Greek has two pronominal systems: weak and

<bodyText confidence="0.98020430952381">
strong. Weak pronominals include dropped subjects and object clitics. Clitics are marked
with case, gender, and number features and attach to the verb. Direct-object clitics are
case-marked “accusative,” and indirect or “dative” clitics are case marked “genitive.”
Strong pronominals are also marked with case, gender, and number features, but syn-
tactically, they behave as common nouns. Their functions are mentioned in Sections 2.2
and 3.1.1. In this study, only weak pronominals were included.
We established the following requirements for the data set of this study: (a) the
subordinate clause or second main clause contains a third-person dropped subject or
weak pronominal, and (b) the preceding main clause or any of its other associated sub-
ordinate clauses contains at least two competing antecedents. A competing antecedent
is defined as a full noun phrase, dropped subject, or weak pronominal that agrees in
gender and number with the anaphoric expression.
For anaphoric reference in main-main and main-subordinate sequences, ideally
we would have liked to include only those tokens in which the second main or sub-
ordinate clause under investigation was preceded by a unit containing only a main
clause. Imposing this extra constraint, however, would have invalidated a large num-
ber of the already limited number of tokens, so we decided against doing so. Although
conducting a second pass of the data, with the purpose of studying further the char-
acteristics of these antecedents, would have been useful, for the purposes of this study
it was not crucial. Further, a consistent pattern of reference in main-main sequences
including cases in which competing antecedents are present in intervening subordi-
nate clauses provides further evidence that entities introduced in subordinate clauses
do not override the salience of the main-clause entities. We will provide an example
to illustrate the point in the next section.
For the data set with main-subordinate sequences, we extracted three types of sub-
ordinate clauses introduced by the following subordinate conjunctions: otan (‘when’),
yati (‘because’), and oste (‘so that’). The final data set included only tokens that fulfilled
the requirements described above.
For the data set with main-main sequences, we randomly selected files from the
corpus subdirectories and included tokens that fulfilled the requirements described
above. The selection process was terminated when the number of qualifying tokens
approximated one hundred.
Two coders, both native speakers of Greek, marked on the data set the antecedent
of the anaphoric expressions. One of the coders was the author and the other was a
naive, nonlinguist speaker of Greek. Intercoder reliability was particularly high (98%).
We attribute the high intercoder reliability to the fact that discourse-deictic expressions,
known to lower intercoder reliability, were not included in this study.25 The few cases of
disagreement between the coders involved either instances perceived as ambiguous
by the coders or abstract complex NPs about which there was disagreement as to
25 Discourse-deictic expressions include demonstratives, such as this and that, used to refer to chunks of
previous discourse. Discourse-deictic expressions in Greek are identical in form with neuter strong
pronominals. Dropped subjects can refer to discourse-deictic expressions, but such cases were excluded.

whether the antecedent was the possessor or the possessee. Such cases were excluded
from the final data set.
The final dataset included 88 instances of main-main sequences and 108 instances
of main-subordinate sequences broken up as follows: 48 otan clauses, 17 yati clauses,
and 43 oste clauses.
4.2.2 Ranking Antecedents and Coding. Based on earlier work on the ranking of
entities in Greek (Miltsakaki 1999), the competing antecedents were ranked according
to the following rule:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.762208">
Ranking Rule for Greek
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980419777777778">
Empathy &gt; Subject &gt; Indirect Object &gt; Direct Object &gt;
Indefinite Quantified NPs, Nonspecific Indefinites
Under Empathy were classified dative subjects of psych verbs. Such verbs are easily
identified from a normally short exhaustive list that can be enumerated for each lan-
guage. In our data, we encountered only the verb like from this verb category.26
All entities introduced in subordinate clauses associated with the main clause are
ranked using the same rule but lower than the main-clause entities. So, for example, if
the evoked entities are main subject, main object, and subordinate subject, the Cf list
is ranked as follows: main subject &gt; main object &gt; subordinate subject. It is not clear
what the ranking would be in cases of multiple subordinate clauses, but this extra
ranking specification was not crucial for the current study.
What was crucial for the study was the ranking of entities evoked within complex
NPs. Greek complex NPs are normally constructed with two nouns: the “possessor,”
marked with genitive, and the “possessee,” marked with nominative, accusative, or,
more rarely, genitive, depending on its grammatical role. The possessee always pre-
cedes the possessor.27 Noun-noun modification is not allowed in Greek. In complex
NPs, animate referents rank higher than inanimates. In all other cases, possessor ranks
higher than possessee. For clarification we present an example below, followed by the
ranking of the evoked entities:
(58) I mitera tis Marias ipe sto Yani oti o Giorgos den tha erhotan.
the mother of-the Maria said to-the John that the George not would come
Maria’s mother told John that George would not come.
Maria &gt; mother &gt; John &gt; George
The salience ranking as specified above was then used for a second pass of coding
done by the author. For each set of candidate antecedents, the intended referent was
marked as either “preferred antecedent” (designated by “Ap”) or “nonpreferred an-
tecedent” (designated by “Anp”). The referent of an anaphoric expression was marked
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.940978">
26 By way of demonstration, the expression I like John in Greek is glossed as “me-genitive like-3rd singular
John-nominative.” In the Greek example, the experiencer of the psych verb is analyzed as subject
despite its genitive marking. Such subjects are known as dative subjects. Modern Greek has lost the
dative case, whose function is now performed by the genitive case.
27 We use the terms possessor and possessee here for convenience to label the structural position of nouns
in complex NPs. These terms, however, do not always describe the semantic relationship between two
nouns. For example, in John’s participation, John can hardly be characterized as the possessor, but in
Greek participation would always precede John and would be case-marked genitive.

as a preferred antecedent when it was the highest-ranked entity in the set of competing
antecedents. The referent of an anaphoric expression was marked as a nonpreferred an-
tecedent when it was not the highest-ranked entity in the set of competing antecedents.
In most cases, the set of candidate antecedents included only two candidates, so sub-
categorizing nonpreferred antecedents was not crucial.
In what follows, example (59) is demonstrative of cases in which the referent of
the anaphoric expression in the second main clause is marked “Ap.” The competing
antecedents in (59a) are ta opla and anthropus, because they have the same number and
gender as the anaphoric tus in (59b). The NP ta opla is the preferred antecedent because
it is the highest-ranked element in the list of potential antecedents and is the intended
referent of the anaphoric. We report this particular example for the additional reason
that it shows that, outside complex NPs, animacy is not a factor in determining the
ranking of entities, even in cases in which the semantics of the verb taking the referent
of the anaphoric as an argument favors the human, in this case, antecedent. Example
(60) also demonstrates a case of reference to Ap. Here, the competing antecedents are
both male characters and semantically plausible subjects of the verb egrafe (‘wrote’).
Note that the assumed ranking receives further support with this example, since the
anaphoric resolves to the subject of the previous clause and not to the most recent,
equally plausible entity.

competing antecedents in (61a) contains PAOK, the name of a football team, and Pikulin
Ortith, the name of a player, both being singular and masculine. In this case, number
agreement with the verb is sufficient to create ambiguity, because Greek verbs are
marked for number but not gender. Also, in Greek, subject collective nouns marked
singular always take a singular verb. The intended referent is Anp, because it is ranked
lower than the subject PAOK.

In the next section we present the results of the analysis of the distribution of

4.3 Results and Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99970975">
Table 2 shows the distribution of anaphoric reference in the experiment described in
Section 4.2. The first column shows the number of times the anaphoric expression
resolves to the preferred antecedent (Ap). The second column shows the number of
times the anaphoric expression resolves to a nonpreferred antecedent (Anp), and the
third column summarizes the total number of tokens per condition.
The corpus-based results support the hypothesis that anaphora does not obey
the same rules in main and subordinate clauses.28 Clearly, the preferred antecedent
as defined structurally is a strong predictor of the referent of main-clause anaphoric
expressions, whereas the picture appears more complicated in subordinate clauses.
In the main-main condition, the Anp instances have interesting properties in com-
mon. Four out of the seven Anp cases involved complex NPs in which both competing
antecedents belong to the complex NP construction. It turned out that the ranking
we assumed for complex NPs did not always predict the intended referent correctly.
For example, in (63), the ranking of the complex NP i simetohi tu k. Avramopulu (Mr.
Avramopoulos’s participation) is Avramopulos &gt; Simetohi because Avramopulos (the
current mayor of Athens) is animate and ranks higher. The intended referent of the

dropped subject in the co-ordinated clause, however, is simetohi. A possible explana-
tion for this pattern is to analyze (63) as verb phrase (VP) coordination, in which case
the two VPs share the same subject.

and 0 favors correspondingly the PaSoK-(name of political party)
and [it]i favors PaSoK at the same time.
The same phenomenon was observed, however, in cases with no VP coordination,
as shown in (64). Again, in this case the anaphoric resolves to koma (‘political party’)
and not to Avramopulos, as would be expected. A possible explanation here is that the
concept political party is not “inanimate” in the sense that it denotes a particular group
of people. In this case, it would be an animate possessor, and the ranking would work
as expected. In conclusion, although it seems possible that the ranking of complex
NPs can be fixed reliably, taking into account special cases of VP coordination and
animacy of collective nouns, the number of instances of such special cases is too small
to draw any definitive conclusions.

The pronoun in (65d) resolves to Mihanismos in (65a). The entity Mihanismos is evoked
much more recently as an inferrable entity in (65d), however—the hoisting of the
Mechanism—and it appears in the same clause as the anaphoric itself. Such complex
cases are extremely rare and generally very hard to resolve with a structure-based
algorithm.
To complete the analysis of the data, we further broke down the distribution of
reference to Ap and Anp for each subordinate clause. The results are shown in Table 3.
Chi-square shows no significant differences among the three types of subordinate
clauses (p &lt; 0.182).
These results indicate that the focusing preferences of the connectives do not by
themselves predict the interpretation of the anaphoric expressions. They are, however,
consistent with Stevenson et al.’s (2000) conclusions that the effect of the connective
on the interpretation of pronominals depends on the event structure of the preceding
clause, either reinforcing or reducing the effect of the verb focusing projections. Lack
of correlations between subordinate type and anaphora resolution is not surprising,
since the data included various types of verbs.

<bodyText confidence="0.999988265306122">
The interpretation of anaphoric expressions in natural language processing is not a
trivial problem. Extensive research in past years has made significant contributions
to our understanding of the phenomenon, and a considerable number of theoreti-
cally motivated and/or corpus-based anaphora resolution algorithms have been built
with more or less success. The task remains a challenge, however, and the slow
rate of improvement in the performance of anaphora resolution systems is somewhat
alarming.
The detailed review of the literature provided in Section 2 revealed that many of
the complications and inconsistencies in anaphora resolution start when algorithms
are faced with anaphoric elements in complex sentences. In particular, we saw that
the interpretation of anaphoric expressions in certain types of clauses would defy any
algorithm based on registers of NPs and a uniform lookup mechanism.
The main contribution of this article is precisely the distinction and specification
of two systems that determine preferences for anaphoric interpretation. Contra earlier
views on the status of subordinate clauses, we argued that subordinate clauses do
not constitute independent processing units. In fact, subordinate clauses can be seen
as filling up extended argument positions required by the predicate of the matrix
clause, and, in this respect, intrasentential relationships that hold between predicates
and participating entities should be expected to be closely determined on semantic
grounds. We identified the boundaries of the basic discourse units with the boundaries
of the unit containing a matrix clause and all its dependent clauses and suggested that
anaphoric interpretation within this unit is determined semantically by the focusing
properties of the verbs and connectives.
On the other hand, topic continuity, as evaluated in the centering model, requires
rather arbitrary specifications of salience to facilitate discourse processing and effi-
cient integration of meaning to the previous discourse. Discourses grow enormous
very quickly. Unrestricted semantic representations and the resulting inferencing load
imposed by exploding semantic computations would considerably slow down dis-
course processing (Kohlhase and Koller 2000). The notion of salience, in the sense
of centering (Joshi and Kuhn 1979), is arguably crucial for efficient processing not
only for natural language processing systems, but also for humans. Topic continuity
therefore is evaluated using a salience mechanism operating across processing units,
and we showed that this mechanism is structural and best defined in centering terms.
We then argued that anaphoric reference that spans across units is also determined
structurally.
Regarding centering-based anaphora resolution algorithms, which seem the best
candidates for resolving anaphora across units, a few technical problems were dis-
cussed in Section 2. We suggested, however, that these problems can be fixed easily
and proposed that the algorithm should select as the preferred antecedent the highest-
ranked entity in the previous unit. This modification is, in fact, consistent with cen-
tering’s pronoun rule and at the same time does not rely on the assumption that text
is maximally coherent.
The corpus-based study reported in Section 5.2 was designed to test the hypothesis
that two mechanisms are indeed at work and also to evaluate the strengths of the
modified centering-based algorithm for resolving anaphoric reference across units.
The results were robust despite the moderate sample size, prescribing a route for a
number of future projects in this direction, the most challenging of which will probably
be understanding the structural and semantic properties of subordination and its role
in the organization, representation, and structure of discourse.

<abstract confidence="0.962349679411764">The problem of proposing referents for anaphoric expressions has been extensively researched in the literature and significant insights have been gained through the various approaches. However, no single model is capable of handling all the cases. We argue that this is due to a failure of the models to identify two distinct processes. Drawing on current insights and empirical data from languages we propose an model of discourse in which topic continuity, computed across units, and focusing preferences internal to these units are subject to different mechanisms. The observed focusing preferences across the units (i.e., intersententially) are best modeled structurally, along the lines suggested in centering theory. The focusing mechanism within the unit is subject to preferences projected by the semantics of the verbs and the connectives in the unit as suggested in semantic/pragmatic focusing accounts. We show that this distinction not only overcomes important problems in anaphora resolution but also reconciles seemingly contradictory experimental results reported in the literature. We specify a model of anaphora resolution that interleaves the two mechanisms. We test the central hypotheses of the proposed model with an experimental study in English and a corpus-based study in Greek. 1. The Problem Extensive research reported in the anaphora resolution literature has focused on the of proposing referents for First, centering, formulated as a model of the relationship between attentional state and form of referring expressions, was utilized as the basis of an algorithm for binding pronominals on the intersentential level (Brennan, Walker-Friedman, and Pollard 1987). The proposed algorithm the BFP algorithm) gives the correct interpretation for the pronominal example (1), stating a preference to resolve the pronominal to than (1) a. Max is waiting for Fred. b. He invited him for dinner. It was soon observed, however, that the BFP algorithm was not capable of handling cases of intrasentential anaphora such as in (2) (adapted from Suri, McCoy, and De- Cristofaro [1999]). of Research in Cognitive Science, Philadelphia, PA 19104. E-mail: elenimi@unagi.cis.upenn.edu 1 “Aposynthesis” is a Greek word that means “decomposition,” that is, pulling apart the components that constitute what appears to be a uniform entity. 2 Although a significant amount of research in anaphora resolution has been carried out in statistical approaches, reviewing such approaches is well beyond the scope of the current article.

Then he took all the money and ran. centering-based BFP algorithm would have a preference to resolve (2d) to not to the based on a preference for a Continue transition. Alternative approaches to anaphora resolution have sought to account for the resolution facts by proposing a semantic/pragmatic rather than structural mechanism. Stevenson et al. (2000) argue that both verbs and connectives have focusing properties affecting the preferred interpretation of pronominals. So in (3), the verb focusing since the person associated with the endpoint of the event of crit- The connective, directs attention to the consequences and hence reinforces focus on (3) a.

The semantic/pragmatic focusing account runs into the type of problem demonin (4), where the preferred interpretation for that is, the structural independent of semantic/pragmatic In such discourses it seems that a structural account is at play (in the sense of Grosz and Sidner [1986]). (4) a. John criticized Bill. b. Next, he insulted Susan. This article sets out to explicate the behavior of pronominals demonstrated in the above examples. Gaining significant insights from current research in anaphora resolution, we reconcile what seem to be contradictory findings in a model according to which interand intrasentential anaphora are not subject to the same mechanism. We argue that the shortcomings of the proposed algorithms are due to confounding two processes, namely, topic continuity and the internal structure of the We conclude that intersentential anaphora is subject to structural constraints, whereas intrasentential anaphora is subject to grammatical as well as semantic/pragmatic constraints. We define the notion of discourse unit and propose a two-level approach to anaphora resolution. Within the unit, anaphora resolution is performed locally and is constrained by the grammar and semantic properties of the predicates and the subordinate conjunctions. This process outputs unresolved anaphoric expressions for which potential referents are picked from a centering-style ranked list of entities constructed in the previous unit. 3 Experimental results regarding these cases are reported in Stevenson et al. (2000). 4 We use the term “topic” to describe a centered entity, that is, the entity that the discourse is “about.” The notion of a centered entity is a discourse construct distinct from “topic” or “theme” as defined in information structure. Elsewhere we have introduced the term “attention structure in discourse” to describe mechanisms, linguistic or nonlinguistic, that language users employ to navigate the hearer’s attention in discourse. Topic continuity is derivative of attention structure in discourse. In this article, however, we have opted for the more transparent term “topic continuity,” as it describes the phenomenon we are mostly concerned with in pretheoretical terms. 320 Niltsakaki Topic Continuity and Intrasentential Anaphora The article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a brief overview of centering-based models of anaphora resolution, discuss their shortcomings, and contrast them with the semantic-focusing account suggested in Stevenson et al. (2000). In Section 3, we present the discourse model we adopt and the specifications we propose for anaphora resolution across and within centering update units. In Section 4, we test the central hypotheses of the proposed model in two studies: an experimental study in English and a corpus-based study in Greek. We conclude with a general discussion in Section 5. 2. Issues and Insights in Anaphora Resolution 2.1 The BFP Algorithm Brennan, Walker-Friedman, and Pollard (1987) were the first to use the centering model as the basis for an anaphora resolution algorithm. The centering model (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) makes the following assumptions: A discourse segment consists of a sequence of utterances, 2. For each utterance, a ranked list of evoked discourse entities is constructed, designated as the Cf list. 3. The highest-ranked element of the Cf list is called the preferred center (Cp). The highest-ranked entity in the Cf list of realized in the backward-looking center (Cb). There are several types of topic transitions from one utterance to the next depending whether the Cb is retained over two consecutive utterances and and this Cb is also the Cp of (see Table 1). The distinction between a Smooth Shift and a Rough Shift is due to Brennan, Walker-Friedman, and Pollard (1987), who observed that the centering model generates ambiguity in cases such as (5): (5) a. Brennan drives an Alfa Romeo. b. She drives too fast. c. Friedman races her on weekends. d. She often beats her. Adding weight to the status of the Cp in (5c) makes it possible to resolve the pronom- (5d) successfully to We will return to the issue of ambiguity shortly. The BFP algorithm consists of three basic steps: 1. Generate possible Cb-Cf combinations. 2. Filter by constraints (e.g., contra-indexing, sortal predicates, centering rules and constraints). Rank by transition orderings (Continue Shift Rough Shift). 321 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 Table 1 Centering transitions. = = Continue Smooth Shift Retain Rough Shift Some of the shortcomings of the BFP algorithm are discussed by Prasad and Strube (2000), who observe that it makes two strategic errors. Prasad and Strube’s observations are made with respect to Hindi but hold in English and Modern Greek, as shown in (6) and (7), respectively. first of these errors occurs in cases in which different from In such cases, the preference for a Continue transition is responsible for pronominal in resolved to the not to the a. school. b. talk to c. and walked away. a. I ti sholio. the Eleni saw the Maria at-the school. school. I the Maria not to-her talked. talk to c. tis files NULL took the friends her and NULL left. and left. There is an important observation to be made here, which we present as the first indication for the distinction between topic continuity and anaphora resolution. On the one hand, the BFP centering-based algorithm makes a resolution error opting for a Continue transition in (6c) and (7c). On the other hand, anaphora aside, the topic transition identified by centering is intuitively correct. In (6) and (7), the discourse is with the current topic, introduced as an entity related to the topic, and then the discourse shifts to elaborate on her doings. The is in fact anticipated by the promotion of the object position in (6a) and (7a) to the subject position in (6b) and (7b). The second error observed by Prasad and Strube (2000) is that the BFP algorithm ambiguity when discourse initial. Example (8) is given as illustration. (8) a. John gave a lot of his property to George. b. His current salary exceeded the average salary by a lot. Given that the Cb in the discourse initial (8a) is unspecified, Continue transitions are when resolving either At this point, the BFP algorithm is not capable of reaching a decision. 322 Miltsakaki Topic Continuity and Intrasentential Anaphora The solution we propose for the two problems is simple: the preferred antecedent the pronominal in the highest-ranked entity in that is compatible with the anaphoric expression. Compatibility is defined in terms of agreement features (number and gender in the case of English). The proposed solution is consistent with the centering model. The most relevant centering notion for anaphora resolution is the pronoun rule, which stipulates that if an entity is realized as a pronoun, then so is the Cb. Opting for resolution to the highest-ranked entity in the previous entity is precisely supported by the pronoun rule because the highest-ranked entity realized the following utterance Cb. On the other hand, using centering transitions for anaphora resolution does not necessarily follow from the original formulation of centering. Centering transitions, as originally formulated and as confirmed by the data discussed above, are best at identifying degrees of topic continuity. There is no a priori reason to expect that they will perform equally well in identifying pronominal referents. This is because assuming maximal coherence (preference for Continue transitions) overlooks properties of attention structure in discourse: strategies that hearers use to signal attention shifts to new centers while maintaining coherence. A Smooth Shift may be intended and signaled appropriately by, for example, promoting a proper name from object to subject position. Interpreting pronominals in accordance with the pronoun rule as suggested here exploits precisely such strategies. We conclude from this section that although centering transitions successfully identify topic continuity in discourse, in anaphora resolution the most useful centering notion is not the transitions themselves but the Cf list ranking in combination with the pronoun rule. 2.2 Functional Centering Strube and Hahn (1996, 1999) elaborate on the nature of the Cf list and propose a centering-based model of anaphora resolution in which the Cf ranking is based not on grammatical function but on functional information status. They recast centering notions in terms of Daneˆs’s (1974) trichotomy between given information, theme, and information. The the most highly ranked element of realized in corresponds to the element that represents given information. The correto the theme of The rhematic elements of the ones not contained Although the original motivation for the functional recast of centering was due to German, a free-word-order language, Strube and Hahn (1996) claim that the functional framework is superior because fixedand free-word-order languages can be accounted for using the same principles. They argue against Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994), in which the Cf ranking is viewed as a language-specific parameter that needs to be set. In what follows we will remain agnostic to the suitability of the functional centering framework for German. We will show, however, that functional centering is not the appropriate framework for all free-word-order languages, much less for languages universally. We bring in evidence from Modern Greek, a free-word-order language. To identify the factors determining Cf ranking in Greek, we employ Rambow’s to test whether surface word order or grammatical function is the most reliable indicator of salience. The relevant examples for the Greek version of 5 Rambow suggests that the order of entities in the position between finite and nonfinite verbs in German (Mittelfeld) affects their salience. Gender in German is grammaticized, so Rambow constructs an example with two same-gender entities in Mittelfeld and uses an ambiguous pronoun in subsequent discourse to determine which of the two entities is more salient. The constructed example is given below. “Fem” indicates that the noun phrases are gender marked “feminine.” 323 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 Rambow’s diagnostic are shown in (9) and (10). The null pronominal in (9b) and (10b) to the subject irrespective of its surface The relevant indicator of in the Cf list appears to be grammatical function, at least a.

Further evidence for the role of grammatical function in Greek comes from syntac- In Greek (and also in Turkish), a strong pronominal or a full noun phrase must be used to promote the object of to the subject position of As the infelicitous interpretations (indicated by the pound sign) show in (11b), reference to object felicitous only with the use of name repetition or a strong a.

Both policy feminine they can both be Also, we have presented the diagnostic test and confirmed the judgment with a sizable group of native speakers of Greek attending the 15th International Symposium on Theoretical and Applied Linguistics (Miltsakaki 2001). 7 It is interesting that in Turkish, another free-word-order language, it has also been shown (Turan 1998) that the strongest indicator of salience is subjecthood. 8 Greek has two pronominal systems: weak pronouns that must cliticize to the verb and strong pronouns that are syntactically similar to full NPs. Dropped subjects are considered part of the system of weak pronouns. In Miltsakaki (2000), we argue that speakers of various languages use available nominal and pronominal forms and prosodic features in spoken language to signal attention structure in discourse. Greek speakers with a three-way distinction in their nominal system (i.e., full noun phrases and weak and strong pronominals) use strong pronominals to signal reference to an entity previously evoked in discourse that is not, however, the most salient entity. This use of strong pronominals is equivalent to certain prosodic effects in English. As noted by an anonymous reviewer, there is extensive literature on the effects of prosody in pronominal interpretation. For example, it has been observed that prominent on the pronominals in (1) yields cospecification of (1) John criticized Bill. Then, HE criticized HIM. need to recruit special prosody to achieve resolution to that structural focusing is indeed at work projecting strong “default” focusing preferences. In (1), there is sufficient semantic information to help the hearer arrive at the intended interpretation. If there was no default interpretation available at hand there would be no need to evoke prosodic effects. Once the linguistic encoding of speakers’ strategies for building attention structure in discourse are identified, incorporating them in the centering framework should be trivial. 9 A “full NP” is any noun phrase that contains a head noun, either common or proper. 324 Miltsakaki Topic Continuity and Intrasentential Anaphora shown in (11c) and We take this as further evidence that objects rank lower than subjects in Greek. O ton the John invited the a. ena poto. he him offered a drink. drink. b. ena poto. he him offered a drink. O ena poto. the George him offered a drink. offered drink. d. ena poto. he-strong him offered a drink. drink. Finally, to test the current results against the functional centering alternative, we replace the definite subject in (9) with an indefinite noun phrase. As shown in (12), the subject is an indefinite noun phrase representing new (or hearer-new) information and the object is a definite phrase, encoding old (or hearer-old) information. The null pronominal in (12b) resolves to the subject of (12a), and the information status of the potential antecedents is disregarded. a. Mia kainourgia veltiosi tin ikonomiki a new arrangement will improve the economic a new the economic Ohi, tha ine aneparkis. No, (it) will be No, it will be inadequate. That the information status is not the relevant factor in discourse salience, at least not cross-linguistically, is also confirmed in Turan (1998) for Turkish and in Prasad and Strube (2000) for Hindi. In both of these languages, the relevant factor for the ranking of elements in the Cf list is grammatical function. We conclude that information status (or hearer status) is not universally the most important factor determining discourse salience (in Cf ranking). Given the facts of pronominalization, we maintain that, at least for English, Greek, Hindi, and Turkish, grammatical function can most reliably determine the relative salience of entities. 10 Empirical evidence for the use of strong pronominals to signal reference to nonsalient entities in Greek is provided in Dimitriadis (1996). Further functions of strong pronominals in Greek are identified in Miltsakaki (1999, 2001). 325 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 2.3 The S-list Algorithm A further modification of the centering model is proposed by Strube (1998), who replaces the functions of the backward-looking center and the centering transitions with the ordering among elements of what he calls the S-list, that is, the list of salient discourse entities. The S-list ranking criteria define a preference for hearer-old over hearer-new discourse entities and are intended to reflect the attentional state of the hearer at any given point in discourse processing. The S-list is generated incrementally and is updated every time an anaphoric element is resolved. Anaphoric elements are resolved with a lookup in the S-list. The elements of the S-list are looked up for compatibility in the order determined by their information status ranking (hearer-old entities are looked up before hearer-new entities). When the analysis of the utterance is finished (processed left to right), the discourse entities that are not realized in the utterance are removed. Strube (1998) claims that the incremental generation and processing of the S-list enables his system to handle interand intrasentential anaphora without any further specifications. Although the S-list has the merit of avoiding ambiguities caused by the way the Cb and the centering transitions interact, it is not capable of handling intrasentential anaphora without any further specifications, as claimed in Strube (1998). Stevenson et al. (2000) report experimental results pointing out cases in which focus preferences are projected by verbs and connectives. Neither a grammatical function ordering nor an information-based ordering is adequate to handle such cases. To illustrate the point, we quote an example, shown in (13), from Stevenson et al. (2000). We construct the Slist ranking the elements according to grammatical function (information status would distinguish between the two proper a. the prize. the prize. both (13a) and (13b) the pronominal resolves to the verb argument with The ordering in the S-list in (13a), however, is the S-list algorithm will resolve the subsequent pronominal to the higher-ranked element the time of processing, in this case, In fairness to the S-list algorithm, this is a problem for any centering-based algorithm that attempts to handle intrasentential according to a fixed ranking of entities in a salience Apparently, certain discourse algorithms relying on a fixed ordering of potential antecedents are not capable of resolving anaphora successfully. In sections 4 and 5, we argue that such cases are most commonly identified intrasententially.</abstract>

To determine how their framework should be extended to handle complex sentences, they develop a methodology specifically designed to 11 This strategy was also adopted by Prasad and Strube (2000) in the implementation of the S-list algorithm for Hindi. 12 It is conceivable that a discourse can be constructed in which the semantics will force a similar pattern of resolution intersententially. Hudson-D’Zmura and Tanenhaus (1998), however, report experimental results that show that in such cases, sentence processing is slowed down. 326 Miltsakaki Topic Continuity and Intrasentential Anaphora determine how people process complex sentences. The central question they pose is whether a complex sentence should be processed as a multiple sentence or as a single sentence. They specifically investigated the “SX because SY” type of complex sentence as well as its interaction with the sentences occurring in the immediately previous and subsequent discourse. (14) (S1) Dodge was robbed by an ex-convict the other night. (15) (S2) The ex-convict tied him up because he wasn’t cooperating. (16) (S3) Then he took all the money and ran. Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro’s findings indicate that the pronoun resolution facts within S2 are consistent with the expectations of both centering and RAFT/RAPR. On completing the processing of the SY clause, however, the most salient entity for the following discourse is not picked from SY. Based on these findings, they propose the prefer-SX hypothesis to extend RAFT/RAPR. Although the prefer-SX hypothesis repairs the algorithm with respect to the construction in question, it seems to be missing a generalization regarding inconsistencies observed within versus across sentences. We return to this issue in Section 4. Stevenson et al.’s Focusing Stevenson et al. (2000) investigate the interaction between structural, thematic, and relational preferences in interpreting pronouns and connectives in discourse. Stevenson, Crawley, and Kleinman (1994) have argued that the crucial factors underlying focusing mechanisms in discourse are semantic/pragmatic factors. Semantic/pragmatic focusing assumes that verbs and connectives project their own focusing preferences. Verbs project focus preferences to the entities associated with the endpoint or consequence of the described event. The focusing preferences of the connective depend its meaning. For example, connectives like attention to the cause of previously described event, and connectives like attention to the consequences of the event. Thus in a sentence like (17), the verb projects a focus preference because the person associated with the endpoint of the event of criti- The connective, directs attention to the consequences, reinforcing the focus which is then picked as the most preferred antecedent for the interpretation of the subsequent pronominal. (17) John criticized Bill so he tried to correct the fault. By way of demonstration, let us turn our attention to action and state verbs. The semantic/pragmatic focusing account predicts that sentences with action verbs focus on the entity associated with the endpoint of the event, namely, the patient, independent of its structural position. This focus is maintained when the connective In one of Stevenson et al.’s (2000) experiments, it is shown that in cases such (18a) the pronominal the patient as its referent both when it is introduced in the previous clause as a subject and when it is introduced there as an object, as in (18b). a. hit by 327 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 similar pattern is observed with state verbs, shown in (19), where the continuation is interpreted as the experiencer of the event independent of its structural position. a. him the prize. him the prize. So the experimental evidence supports Stevenson et al.’s view that the focusing properties of verbs affect the interpretation of pronominals. Hudson-D’Zmura and Tanenhaus (1998), however, report experimental results that, at first blush, contradict this view. They conducted a similar experiment to test whether subject-object or stimulus-experiencer is the crucial distinction for pronominal interpretation. Subjects were given sentence (20) followed by the continuations (20a)–(20b) and were asked to judge the continuations for naturalness. (20) Max despises Ross. a. He always gives Ross a hard time. b. He always gives Max a hard time. Hudson-D’Zmura and Tanenhaus’s results show that there is a strong preference for the subject interpretation independent of the thematic role. What are we to conclude from these inconsistent results? The results show that the same type of verb (i.e., a state verb) in some cases projects its own focus preference (e.g., experiencer), but in other cases it does not. In order to account for the facts, one option would be to continue stretching structural focusing to account for the facts. Another option would be to continue stretching semantic focusing. In the following section, we propose an aposynthetic model for anaphora resolution in which we divide the labor of anaphoric interpretation between the two mechanisms and define the domains of their applicability. 3. The Proposal: Aposynthesis 3.1 Outline of the Discourse Model We assume that the discourse is organized hierarchically in linear and embedded segments as specified in Grosz and Sidner (1986). We also adopt the centering view of local-discourse coherence to model topic continuity in discourse. According to the model each segment consists of a sequence of The size of an utterance, however, is left unspecified. Because transitions are computed for each utterance, will rename utterances as update units argue that a centering update unit consists of a matrix clause and all the dependent clauses associated with it. For each update unit a list of forward-looking centers is constructed and ranked according to the salience of each. Consistent with the proposed definition of unit, we argue that entities evoked in subordinate clauses are of lower salience than entities evoked in the matrix clause and are ranked accordingly. The proposed centering specifications have the following corollaries: 1. The linear order of subordinate clauses relative to the matrix clause does not affect the salience status of the entities. 328 Miltsakaki Topic Continuity and Intrasentential Anaphora 2. Entities evoked in subordinate clauses are available as potential links between the current and previous or subsequent discourse. 3. Topic shifts must be established in matrix clauses. 4. Backward anaphora in subordinate clauses is no longer “backward,” as anaphors in subordinate clauses are processed before main clauses independent of their linear order. Finally, we assume that anaphora across units obeys centering’s pronoun rule. However, we do not adopt the BFP algorithm for anaphora resolution across units. Instead, suggested in Section 2.1, the preferred antecedent for a pronominal in the entity in modulo agreement features. The remainder of this section is organized as follows. First, we briefly review Kameyama’s tensed adjunct hypothesis, which states that subordinate clauses are independent processing units and argue that on the basis of new empirical evidence the hypothesis cannot be maintained. Next, we present evidence in support of a new definition of the update unit. Data from English, Greek, and Japanese show that treating subordinate clauses as independent units yields counterintuitive centering transitions and violations of the pronoun rule. The Centering Update Unit. the update unit within the framework of the centering model became central in very early work, because centering was adopted and modified mainly to account for anaphora resolution. Given that anaphoric elements occur in all types of clauses, it was crucial that the size of the update unit be constrained to enable the handling of intrasentential anaphora. To a large extent, efforts to identify the appropriate size for the unit were often dictated by needs specific to anaphora resolution algorithms. Centering was not originally formulated, however, as a model of anaphora resolution. For purposes of testing the suitability of the relevant unit in centering, it would be desirable to derive a model that yields transitions that reflect our intuitions about perceived discourse coherence, as well as the degree of the processing load required by the hearer/reader at any given time in discourse processing. Reflecting degrees of continuity is not a concern for anaphora resolution algorithms. Kameyama (1993, 1998) was concerned with the problem of intrasentential centering and, in particular, the definition of the appropriate update unit when complex sentences are processed. Kameyama suggested breaking up complex sentences according to the following hypotheses: 1. Conjoined and adjoined tensed clauses form independent units. 2. Tenseless subordinate clauses, report complements, and relative clauses belong to the update unit containing the matrix clause. With regard to her tensed adjunct hypothesis, which treated tensed adjunct clauses (for reasons of convenience, we will henceforth use the term “subordinate” to refer to this class of clauses) as independent units, Kameyama brings in support from backward anaphora. She argues that the tensed adjunct hypothesis predicts that the pronoun in the fronted subordinate clause in (21c), for example, is anaphorically dependent on an entity already introduced in the immediate discourse and not on the subject of the 329 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 main clause to which it is attached: a. reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism but never there was anything he as an individual could do about it. When the Christina Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago d. convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and out to do it. This view of backward anaphora, in fact, was strongly professed by Kuno (1972), asserted that there was no anaphora: the referent of an apparent cataphoric pronoun must appear in the previous discourse. Kameyama’s (also Kuno’s) argument is weak in two respects. First, it is not empirically tested that in cases of backward anaphora the antecedent is found in the immediate discourse. Carden (1982) and van Hoek (1997) provide empirical evidence of pronouns that are the first mention of their referent in discourse. Most recently, Tanaka (2000) reported that in the cataphora data retrieved from the Anaphoric Treebank, out of 133 total occurrences of personal pronouns encoded as “cataphoric,” 47 (35.3%) were “first mentioned.” Among the 47 cases of first-mention cataphora, 6 instances were Secondly, this account leaves the use of a full NP in Kameyama’s main clause unexplained the same referent). Full NPs and proper names occurring in Continue transitions have been observed to signify a segment boundary. Assuming that segment boundaries do not occur between a main clause and a subordinate clause associated with it, the use of a full NP in (21d) remains puzzling. Empirical evidence in support of Kameyama’s hypothesis that tensed subordinate clauses should be treated as independent processing units was brought forth by Di Eugenio (1990, 1998), who carried out centering studies in Italian. Di Eugenio (1990) proposed that the alternation of null and overt pronominal subjects in Italian could be explained in terms of centering transitions. Typically, a null subject signals a Continue a strong pronoun a Retain or a Following Kameyama (1993), Di Eugenio treats subordinate clauses as independent update units. Her motivation for doing so comes from the following example, in which the use of a strong pronoun in the main clause cannot be explained if the preceding adjunct is not treated as an independent update unit. The translation (taken from Di Eugenio [1998]) is literal but not word for word. For the utterance preceding the = and = 13 The Anaphoric Treebank is a corpus of a collection of news reports, annotated with, among other things, type of anaphoric relations. It was developed by UCREL (Unit for Computer Research on the English Language) at Lancaster University, collaborating with the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. 14 Di Eugenio collapsed the distinction between Smooth and Rough Shifts. The reader is referred, however, to Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000a, 2000b) for a discussion of the significance of Rough Shifts in the evaluation of text coherence. 330 Miltsakaki Topic Continuity and Intrasentential Anaphora a. Prima che i seduti a tavola a far colazione, the lazy down to have breakfast, via col alle altre cascine della tenuta. left with for the other farmhouses on the property. In Miltsakaki (2001), we report the results of a centering study in Greek. One of the surprising findings in this study was that a few strong pronouns appeared in Continue transitions. The result was surprising because the overall distribution of nominal and pronominal forms revealed that weak pronouns were most common in Continue transitions, whereas strong pronouns, full noun phrases, and proper nouns were associated with Rough Shift transitions. On closer inspection, we observed that in six out of the eight instances of strong pronouns in Continue transitions, the referent of the strong pronoun was contrasted on some property with some other entity belonging a previously evoked set of Although the sample is too small to draw any definitive conclusions, we can at least entertain the hypothesis that strong pronouns in Italian serve a similar function. If this is true, then an alternative explanation is for Di Eugenio’s data: in (22b), the most salient entity in the current is contrasted with the in (22a), on the property of “laziness.” It turns out that the hypothesis that the strong pronoun does not signal a Rough Shift transition is confirmed by the preceding discourse, in which the “vicina” appears as the most salient entity, realized with multiple dropped subjects. The discourse immediately (22) is shown in a. una donna non solo graziosa ma anche energica e dotata di spirito pratico; not only is but also energetic and endowed with a pragmatic spirit; b. la combinazione di tutto cio’ e’, a dir poco, efficace. and the combination of all these qualities is effective, to say the least. c. alza all’alba per sovrintendere a che si dia da mangiare alle bestie, si faccia il burro, si mandi via il latte che deve essere venduto; una quantita’ di cose fatte mentre il piu’ della gente se la dorme della grossa. up at dawn to supervise that the cows are fed, that the butter is made, that the milk to be sold is sent away; a lot of things done while most people sleep soundly. We now turn to English and Greek to show that treating subordinate clauses as independent centering units yields counterintuitive topic transitions. First, consider the constructed example from English shown in (24). 15 We ignored one further instance of a strong pronominal in a Continue transition, as in that case the strongpronominal headed a relative clause and its use was forced by the grammar. 16 Many thanks to Barbara Di Eugenio (personal communication) for providing me with the extra data in (23). I presume that Di Eugenio’s coding of the null realization in (23b) is based on the inferable that the noun phrase ’la combinazione di tutto ci´o’ refers to 331 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 (24) Sequence: main-subordinate-main a. John had a terrible headache. b. When the meeting was over, Shift c. he rushed to the pharmacy store. Shift (25) Sequence: main-main-subordinate a. John had a terrible headache. b. He rushed to the pharmacy store store c. when the meeting was over. Shift Allowing the subordinate clause to function as a single update unit yields a sequence of two Rough Shifts, which is diagnostic of a highly discontinuous discourse. Further, if indeed there are two Rough Shift transitions in this discourse, the use of the pronominal in the third unit is puzzling. A sequence of two Rough Shift transitions in this short discourse is counterintuitive and unexpected given that of all centering transitions, Rough Shifts in particular have been shown to (a) disfavor pronominal reference (Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Di Eugenio 1998; and Miltsakaki 1999, among others), (b) be rare in corpora, to the extent that the transition has been ignored by some researchers (Di Eugenio 1998 and Hurewitz 1998, among others), and (c) be reliable measures of low coherence in student essays (Miltsakaki and Kukich 2000a). In addition, simply reversing the order of the clauses, shown in (25), causes an unexpected improvement, with one Rough Shift transition being replaced with a Continue. Assuming that the two discourses demonstrate a similar degree of continuity in the structure (they are both we would expect the transitions to reflect this similarity when, in fact, they do not.</abstract>

Given the facts of pronominalization, we maintain that, at least for English, Greek, Hindi, and Turkish, grammatical function can most reliably determine the relative salience of entities. 10 Empirical evidence for the use of strong pronominals to signal reference to nonsalient entities in Greek is provided in Dimitriadis (1996).

For each utterance, a ranked list of evoked discourse entities is constructed, designated as the Cf list. 3. The highest-ranked element of the Cf list is called the preferred center (Cp). 4.

On the other hand, topic continuity, as evaluated in the centering model, requires rather arbitrary specifications of salience to facilitate discourse processing and efficient integration of meaning to the previous discourse. Discourses grow enormous very quickly. Unrestricted semantic representations and the resulting inferencing load imposed by exploding semantic computations would considerably slow down discourse processing (Kohlhase and Koller 2000). The notion of salience, in the sense of centering (Joshi and Kuhn 1979), is arguably crucial for efficient processing not only for natural language processing systems, but also for humans. Topic continuity therefore is evaluated using a salience mechanism operating across processing units, and we showed that this mechanism is structural and best defined in centering terms. We then argued that anaphoric reference that spans across units is also determined structurally.

On the other hand, topic continuity, as evaluated in the centering model, requires rather arbitrary specifications of salience to facilitate discourse processing and efficient integration of meaning to the previous discourse. Discourses grow enormous very quickly. Unrestricted semantic representations and the resulting inferencing load imposed by exploding semantic computations would considerably slow down discourse processing (Kohlhase and Koller 2000). The notion of salience, in the sense of centering (Joshi and Kuhn 1979), is arguably crucial for efficient processing not only for natural language processing systems, but also for humans. Topic continuity therefore is evaluated using a salience mechanism operating across processing units, and we showed that this mechanism is structural and best defined in centering terms. We then argued that anaphoric reference that spans across units is also determined structurally. Regarding centering-based anaphora resolution algorithms, which seem the best candidates for resolving anaphora across units,</context>

Kameyama’s (also Kuno’s) argument is weak in two respects. First, it is not empirically tested that in cases of backward anaphora the antecedent is found in the immediate discourse. Carden (1982) and van Hoek (1997) provide empirical evidence of pronouns that are the first mention of their referent in discourse.

The first component treats reflexive pronouns by constraining the search procedure with special configurational requirements. The second component takes over when the antecedent of an anaphor is to be found in previous sentences, and the third component searches subparts of the parse tree in cycles until the highest clause is reached. Intersententially, Hobbs’s syntactic algorithm favors subjects over objects, as subjects are higher up in the parse tree than objects. Intersententially, our approach and Hobbs’s algorithm would opt for the same type of antecedent. As Lappin and Leass (1994) have pointed out, however, the syntactic search procedure seems to work pretty well in English because grammatical order corresponds to phrase order. For other languages, either free-word-order languages like Greek or languages in which salience is determined by other factors (e.g., information status, as has been argued for German [Strube 1998]), Hobbs’s search procedure would fail, because it is too rigid to accommodate linguistic variation in marking salience. Even for languages like English, the relevant salience of entities may be undermined by nonsyntactic factors. As has already been s</context>

The BFP algorithm consists of three basic steps: 1. Generate possible Cb-Cf combinations. 2. Filter by constraints (e.g., contra-indexing, sortal predicates, centering rules and constraints). 3. Rank by transition orderings (Continue &gt; Retain &gt; Smooth Shift &gt; Rough Shift). 321 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 Table 1 Centering transitions. Cb(Ui) = Cb(Ui−1) Cb(Ui) 54 Cb(Ui−1) Cb(Ui) = Cp(Ui) Continue Smooth Shift Cb(Ui) # Cp(Ui) Retain Rough Shift Some of the shortcomings of the BFP algorithm are discussed by Prasad and Strube (2000), who observe that it makes two strategic errors. Prasad and Strube’s observations are made with respect to Hindi but hold in English and Modern Greek, as shown in (6) and (7), respectively. The first of these errors occurs in cases in which Cb(Ui_1) is different from Cp(Ui_1). In such cases, the preference for a Continue transition is responsible for the pronominal in Ui being resolved to the Cb(Ui_1) and not to the Cp(Ui_1). (6) a. Elleni saw Maryj at school. b.

On the other hand, anaphora aside, the topic transition identified by centering is intuitively correct. In (6) and (7), the discourse is initiated with Ellen as the current topic, Maria is introduced as an entity related to the current topic, and then the discourse shifts to Maria to elaborate on her doings. The shift is in fact anticipated by the promotion of Maria from the object position in (6a) and (7a) to the subject position in (6b) and (7b). The second error observed by Prasad and Strube (2000) is that the BFP algorithm generates ambiguity when Ui_1 is discourse initial. Example (8) is given as illustration. (8) a. John gave a lot of his property to George. b. His current salary exceeded the average salary by a lot. Given that the Cb in the discourse initial (8a) is unspecified, Continue transitions are generated when resolving his to either John or George. At this point, the BFP algorithm is not capable of reaching a decision. 322 Miltsakaki Topic Continuity and Intrasentential Anaphora The solution we propose for the two problems is simple: the preferred antecedent for the pronomi</context>

That the information status is not the relevant factor in discourse salience, at least not cross-linguistically, is also confirmed in Turan (1998) for Turkish and in Prasad and Strube (2000) for Hindi. In both of these languages, the relevant factor for the ranking of elements in the Cf list is grammatical function. We conclude that information status (or hearer status) is not universally the most important factor determining discourse salience (in Cf ranking). Given the facts of pronominalization, we maintain that, at least for English, Greek, Hindi, and Turkish, grammatical function can most reliably determine the relative salience of entities. 10 Empirical evidence for the use of strong pronominals to signal reference to nonsalient entities in Greek is provided in Dimitriadis </context>

We define the notion of discourse unit and propose a two-level approach to anaphora resolution. Within the unit, anaphora resolution is performed locally and is constrained by the grammar and semantic properties of the predicates and the subordinate conjunctions. This process outputs unresolved anaphoric expressions for which potential referents are picked from a centering-style ranked list of entities constructed in the previous unit. 3 Experimental results regarding these cases are reported in Stevenson et al. (2000). 4 We use the term “topic” to describe a centered entity, that is, the entity that the discourse is “about.” The notion of a centered entity is a discourse construct distinct from “topic” or “theme” as defined in information structure. Elsewhere we have introduced the term “attention structure in discourse” to describe mechanisms, linguistic or nonlinguistic, that language users employ to navigate the hearer’s attention in discourse. Topic continuity is derivative of attention structure in discourse. In this article, however, we have opted for the more transparent term “topic continuity,” as </context>

Although the S-list has the merit of avoiding ambiguities caused by the way the Cb and the centering transitions interact, it is not capable of handling intrasentential anaphora without any further specifications, as claimed in Strube (1998). Stevenson et al. (2000) report experimental results pointing out cases in which focus preferences are projected by verbs and connectives. Neither a grammatical function ordering nor an information-based ordering is adequate to handle such cases. To illustrate the point, we quote an example, shown in (13), from Stevenson et al. (2000). We construct the Slist ranking the elements according to grammatical function (information status would not distinguish between the two proper names).11 (13) a.

On completing the processing of the SY clause, however, the most salient entity for the following discourse is not picked from SY. Based on these findings, they propose the prefer-SX hypothesis to extend RAFT/RAPR. Although the prefer-SX hypothesis repairs the algorithm with respect to the construction in question, it seems to be missing a generalization regarding inconsistencies observed within versus across sentences. We return to this issue in Section 4. 2.5 Stevenson et al.’s Semantic/Pragmatic Focusing Stevenson et al. (2000) investigate the interaction between structural, thematic, and relational preferences in interpreting pronouns and connectives in discourse. Stevenson, Crawley, and Kleinman (1994) have argued that the crucial factors underlying focusing mechanisms in discourse are semantic/pragmatic factors. Semantic/pragmatic focusing assumes that verbs and connectives project their own focusing preferences. Verbs project focus preferences to the entities associated with the endpoint or consequence of the described event. The focusing preferences of the connective depend on its meaning. For example, connecti</context>

Topic continuity is computed across centering update units. Anaphoric reference spanning across update units relates to topic continuity and is therefore determined structurally in accordance with centering rules and constraints. Within the unit, anaphora is constrained by focusing preferences projected by the matrix predicate and the extended arguments of the predicate that can be locally realized through subordination. This basic outline is sufficient to explain (most of) the data we have seen so far. The experiments reported in Stevenson et al. (2000), which show a main effect of thematic focusing, involve the interpretation of anaphoric expressions in subordinate clauses. On the other hand, Hudson-D’Zmura and Tanenhaus’s (1998) experiments on similar types of verbs show a main effect of structural focusing. The difference between the two sets of experiments is that Hudson-D’Zmura and Tanenhaus’s (1998) experiments involve sequences of main clauses, whereas in Stevenson et al. (2000) the relevant experiments involve subordinate clauses. Furthermore, Stevenson et al. (2000) report results on a different set of experiments showing a main eff</context>

In English, so denotes two relations: consequence and purpose. The examples below indicate that only purpose-so behaves as a subordinate conjunction. 22 (46) I had to give up my job so I could be happy again.

The S-list ranking criteria define a preference for hearer-old over hearer-new discourse entities and are intended to reflect the attentional state of the hearer at any given point in discourse processing.

Intersententially, our approach and Hobbs’s algorithm would opt for the same type of antecedent.

For other languages, either free-word-order languages like Greek or languages in which salience is determined by other factors (e.g., information status, as has been argued for German [Strube 1998]), Hobbs’s search procedure would fail, because it is too rigid to accommodate linguistic variation in marking salience.

A Smooth Shift may be intended and signaled appropriately by, for example, promoting a proper name from object to subject position. Interpreting pronominals in accordance with the pronoun rule as suggested here exploits precisely such strategies. We conclude from this section that although centering transitions successfully identify topic continuity in discourse, in anaphora resolution the most useful centering notion is not the transitions themselves but the Cf list ranking in combination with the pronoun rule. 2.2 Functional Centering Strube and Hahn (1996, 1999) elaborate on the nature of the Cf list and propose a centering-based model of anaphora resolution in which the Cf ranking is based not on grammatical function but on functional information status. They recast centering notions in terms of Daneˆs’s (1974) trichotomy between given information, theme, and new information. The Cb(Ui), the most highly ranked element of Cf(Ui_1) realized in Ui, corresponds to the element that represents given information. The Cp(Ui) corresponds to the theme of Ui.

Kameyama’s (also Kuno’s) argument is weak in two respects. First, it is not empirically tested that in cases of backward anaphora the antecedent is found in the immediate discourse. Carden (1982) and van Hoek (1997) provide empirical evidence of pronouns that are the first mention of their referent in discourse. Most recently, Tanaka (2000) reported that in the cataphora data retrieved from the Anaphoric Treebank, out of 133 total occurrences of personal pronouns encoded as “cataphoric,” 47 (35.3%) were “first mentioned.” Among the 47 cases of first-mention cataphora, 6 instances were discourse initial.13 Secondly, this account leaves the use of a full NP in Kameyama’s main clause (21d) unexplained (Kern and Jim have the same referent).

Also, we have presented the diagnostic test and confirmed the judgment with a sizable group of native speakers of Greek attending the 15th International Symposium on Theoretical and Applied Linguistics (Miltsakaki 2001). 7 It is interesting that in Turkish, another free-word-order language, it has also been shown (Turan 1998) that the strongest indicator of salience is subjecthood. 8 Greek has two pronominal systems: weak pronouns that must cliticize to the verb and strong pronouns that are syntactically similar to full NPs. Dropped subjects are considered part of the system of weak pronouns. In Miltsakaki (2000), we argue that speakers of various languages use available nominal and pronominal forms and prosodic features in spoken language to signal attention structure in discourse.

In both of these languages, the relevant factor for the ranking of elements in the Cf list is grammatical function.

In discourse grammars, this insight is captured in the discourse Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) treatment of subordinate conjunctions. In discourse LTAGs, subordinate conjunctions are treated as predicates, anchoring initial trees containing the main and the subordinate clause as arguments. Each subordinate conjunction may anchor a family of trees to reflect variations in the surface order of the substituted argument clauses, but the predicateargument relation remains the same (Webber and Joshi 1998; Webber et al., 1999a, 1999b). The above discussion relates to the definition of the centering update unit in the following way. The centering model keeps track of center continuations and center shifts. In other words, it keeps track of discourse salience. If we dissociate salience from information structure, the relevant unit for computing salience is at the sentence level, which we can visualize as a horizontal level (see Figure 1). The relative order of independent/dependent clauses is determined by information structuring, a process possibly orthogonal to the computing of salience. Subor</context>
