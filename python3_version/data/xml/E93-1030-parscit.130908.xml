We offer a semantics and pragmatics of the
pluperfect in narrative discourse. We ex-
amine in a formal model of implicature,
how the reader&apos;s knowledge about the dis-
course, Gricean-maxims and causation con-
tribute to the meaning of the pluperfect.
By placing the analysis in a theory where
the interactions among these knowledge re-

In this paper, we investigate the impact of the plu-
perfect tense on the temporal and rhetorical struc-
ture of narrative discourse. We will use a represen-
tation framework for discourse structure called SDRT
(standing for Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory) (Asher 1993), and a theory of discourse at-
tachment called DICE (standing for Discourse and
Commonsense Entailment), which is designed to
compute temporal implicatures for natural language
texts (Lascarides and Asher 1991). We will argue
that the resultant analysis overcomes problems with
Reichenbachian theories of tense (e.g., Kamp 1991a).

2 Limitations of Kamp&apos;s Account
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.950428578947368">
Kamp&apos;s (1991a) Reichenbachian account of the plu-
perfect is problematic in at least three ways. Firstly,
the temporal structure of a text is determined solely

from syntax, so there can be no explanation of why
even though (1) has the same tense structure as (2),
they are interpreted differently: no order is inferred
between the events in (lb-d) while there is temporal
progression in (2b-d).
Alexis was a very good girl by the time
she went to bed yesterday.
She had helped her mum with the house-
work.
She had practised her piano.
She had done all her homework.
We all felt very good about it.
Max arrived at the summit at midday.
He had got up at 5:30am,
had prepared his lunch, and
had passed base camp before 7am.
Intuitively, the order of events in (2b-d) is inferred
from causal knowledge about the typical orders be-
tween the events and by the temporal information
conveyed by the list structure. In contrast, there is
no knowledge that enables such an inference in (lb-
d). An explanation in these terms requires us to
solve the Interaction Problem: The analysis of the
pluperfect must interact in precise and systematic
ways with the reader&apos;s causal knowledge, pragmatic
maxims and the discourse type to yield appropri-
ate temporal structures. Kamp&apos;s syntactic-based ac-
count fails to specify such interactions.
The second problem is that, in line with the Re-
ichenbachian approach, the semantics of tense ap-
peals only to temporal relations. But consider texts

Texts (3) and (4) attempt to describe similar tem-
poral relations, and yet only (3) is acceptable. Simi-
larly, (4) and (5) describe similar temporal relations
between the first event mentioned and the second,
but only (5) is acceptable. One can view (3) to (5)
as a manifestation of contextual relevance; a similar
view is proposed in Caenepeel and Sandström (1992).
One event being in the consequent state of the other
is sufficient for simple past tensed text to satisfy the
Contextual Relevance Constraint (cf. (3)), but it
won&apos;t do for the pluperfect in (4), although the ad-
ditional information in (5) ameliorates (4)&apos;s incoher-
ence. We can thus think of the pluperfect as a dis-
course marker that indicates that the range of possi-
ble connections that would make the clause &apos;contex-
tually relevant&apos; is restricted (relative to the possibil-
ities for the simple past). This yields the Relevance
Problem: The analysis of the pluperfect must take
Contextual Relevance into account. Kamp (1991a)
fails to explain the incoherence of (4) because the Re-
ichenbachian analysis doesn&apos;t solve this problem: to
solve it, a Reichenbachian semantics of tense would
have to be extended so that it considers causal and
rhetorical connections, as well as temporal relations.
A third problem with the Reichenbachian account
of tense is that the purely temporal specification fails
to explain why the pluperfect clause can initiate a
perspective shift such as those that occur in free in-
direct style, where the control over the proposition
shifts from the author to a character in the text
(Leech and Short 1981, Quirk et al. 1985). For ex-
ample, consider text (6), taken from Nakhimovsky
(1988):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.757203">
(6) a. The telephone rang.
b. It was Mme Dupont.
c. Her husband had eaten too many oysters
for lunch.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.987869923076923">
d. The doctor recommended a change in
lifestyle
(6c) initiates free indirect style: Control over the
proposition in (6c) is shifted from the author to Mme
Dupont, because in contrast to (6b), (6c) reports
Mme Dupont &apos;s perceptions (of what was said over
the phone). The pluperfect plays a crucial role in
creating free indirect style in (6), for replacing it with
the simple past would mean that the author&apos;s per-
spective is maintained:
(6) c&apos;. Her husband ate too many oysters for
lunch.
This yields the Perspective Problem: The semantic
framework used must be able to represent perspec-
tive, such as those that occur in indirect speech. Al-
though Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) is a
rich semantic framework in which perspective can be
represented, the analysis of tense in DRT presented
in (Kamp 1991a) fails to exploit this. All purely Re-
ichenbachian treatments of tense fail to capture shifts
in perspective, because they don&apos;t take into account
the information status of the clauses concerned.
In order to solve the Interaction, Relevance and
Perspective Problems, we will formalise the discourse
role of the pluperfect using two tools: a semantically-
based theory of discourse structure called SDRT, and
a formal theory of discourse attachment called DICE.
Using these tools, we model both the pluperfect&apos;s se-
mantic and pragmatic contributions to discourse. In
contrast to Kamp (1991a), we will examine the role
that the reader&apos;s background knowledge plays in in-
terpreting the pluperfect tense, and provide analy-
ses of the above texts. The reason we devote atten-
tion to a formal account is because we assume that
the reader&apos;s various knowledge resources on occasion
yield conflicting conclusions about discourse struc-
ture (cf. Hobbs 1985, Lascarides and Asher 1991),
and resolving the conflicts is arbitrary unless sup-
ported by an underlying logical consequence relation.

3 A Description of SDRT and DICE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99698205882353">
We start with a brief overview of SDRT and DICE.
SDRT (Asher 1993) takes the basic building blocks
of discourse structure to be propositions with a dy-
namic content, which are represented as DRss—the
representation scheme in Kamp&apos;s (1981) DRT. How-
ever, discourse relations may also obtain between
more complex structures—segmented DRss (sDRss),
which are defined recursively. In SDRT, an NL text
is represented by an SDRS, which is a pair of sets
containing respectively: the DRSS or mass repre-
senting respectively sentences or text segments, and
discourse relations between them. These structures
are constructed in a dynamic, incremental fashion.
The default assumption is that the sentence bound-
ary marks the unit of information to be attached to
the SDRS for the preceding discourse.
Discourse relations modelled after those proposed
by Hobbs (1985) and Thompson and Mann (1987)
link together the constituents of an SDRS. We will
use seven discourse relations: Narration, Elabora-
tion, Explanation, Background, Continuation, Par-
allel and Contrast. The first four of these constrain
temporal structure: Narration entails that the de-
scriptive order of events matches their temporal or-
der; an Explanation or Elaboration entail they mis-
match; and Background entails temporal overlap.
The recursive nature of swiss gives discourse
structures a hierarchical configuration. Certain dis-
course relations in an SDRS impose a hierarchical
structure; these subordinating relations are Elabo-
ration and Explanation. The so-called open con-
stituents to which new information can attach are
the previous constituent or constituents it elaborates
or explains. Thus the open clauses are those on the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995295">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999674925">
right frontier of the discourse structure (cf. Polanyi
1985, Grosz and Sidner 1986, Webber 1991), assum-
ing that it is built in a depth first left to right manner.
SDRT specifies which parts of the SDRS are avail-
able to the representation of the current sentence for
attachment via a discourse relation. DICE provides
the means to infer from the reader&apos;s knowledge re-
sources which discourse relation should be used to do
attachment. DICE makes the following claims. The
current sentence is attached to the preceding SDRS
with a discourse relation; the process by which this
is done takes the reader&apos;s background knowledge into
account, and the resulting SDRS determines how time
is structured in the discourse. Here, we assume the
reader&apos;s knowledge base (KB) contains: the SDRS for
the text so far; the logical form of the current sen-
tence; an assumption that that logical form must
attach at an open site (i.e., the text is coherent);
all defeasible and indefeasible world and pragmatic
knowledge; and the laws of logic.
The rules introduced below are shown in Las-
carides and Asher (1991) to be manifestations of
Gricean-style pragmatic maxims and world knowl-
edge; we assume they form part of the reader&apos;s KB.
A formal notation makes clear both the logical struc-
ture of these rules, and the problems involved in
calculating implicature. Let (r, a,#) be the update
function, which means &amp;quot;the representation T of the
text so far, of which a is an open node, is to be up-
dated with the representation of the current sen-
tence via a discourse relation with a&amp;quot;. Let a f3
mean that a is a topic for fl; let ea be a term refer-
ring to the main eventuality described by the clause
a; and let f all(m, ea) mean that this event is a Max
falling. Let el -4 e2 mean the eventuality ei precedes
e2, and cause(ei , e2) mean el causes e2. Finally, we
represent the defeasible connective as a conditional &gt;
(so &gt; ik means &apos;if 4, then normally 1,/,&apos;). The max-
ims for modelling implicature are then represented
as schemas:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.976760357142857">

<bodyText confidence="0.989155848484848">
o(cause(e2, ei) --,e1 -4 ez)
The rules for Narration and its Axiom convey in-
formation about the pragmatic effects of the tex-
tual order of events; by default, textual order mir-
rors temporal order. States Overlap, Background
and its Axiom convey the pragmatic effects derived
from aktionsart information (states normally provide
background information). Continuation and Contin-
uing Discourse Patterns convey the pragmatic effects
of the preceding discourse structure; they state that
normally, the current clause 7 continues to describe
the same topic a as the preceding clause /3 did (for
in SDRT, Continuation(fl , 7) entails fl and 7 have the
same topic a), and 7 is related to a by the same dis-
course relation. Finally, that Causes Precede their
Effects is indefeasible world knowledge.
The logic on which DICE rests is Asher and Mor-
reau&apos;s (1991) Commonsense Entailment (CE). Three
patterns of nonmonotonic inference are particularly
relevant. The first is Defeasible Modus Ponens: if
one default rule has its antecedent verified, then the
consequent is nonmonotonically inferred. The sec-
ond is the Penguin Principle: if there are conflicting
default rules that apply, and their antecedents are
in logical entailment relations, then the consequent
of the rule with the most specific antecedent is in-
ferred. The third is the Nixon Diamond: if there are
conflicting default rules that apply but no logical re-
lations between the antecedents, then no conclusions
are inferred.
In interpreting text (7), the mit contains (a, a,/3),
where a and /3 are respectively the logical forms of
the first and second sentences.

(7) Max stood up. John greeted him.
(8) Max opened the door. The room was pitch
dark.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945176470588">
The only rule that applies is Narration, and its con-
sequent is inferred via Defeasible Modus Ponens.
Hence by logical omniscience, the standing up pre-
cedes the greeting. In contrast, text (8) verifies the
antecedents to two conflicting defeasible laws: Nar-
ration and States Overlap. By the Penguin Prin-
ciple, States Overlap wins, because its antecedent
logically entails Narration&apos;s. In turn, this entails
that the antecedent to Background is verified; and
whilst conflicting with Narration, it&apos;s more specific,
and hence its consequent—Background--follows by
the Penguin Principle. We call this double applica-
tion of the Penguin Principle the Cascaded Penguin
Principle.&apos;

herence (Lascarides and Asher, 1991). If the reader&apos;s
knowledge resources are in irresolvable conflict, no

interpretations are given in Lascarides and Asher (in

ular case considered here, CE validates it.

conclusions about the discourse structure can be in-
ferred. DICE exploits this account of incoherence in
its approach to discourse popping. When a Nixon
Diamond occurs in attempting to attach the current
clause to the previous one, they don&apos;t form a coher-
ent text segment. So the current clause must attach
to one of the other open clauses, resulting in dis-
course popping.

4 The Semantics of the Pluperfect
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9792384375">
DICE represents temporal information in two places:
first, in the DRS representing a sentence; and second,
in the discourse relations. Because of these two lev-
els, we can preserve sentential equivalence between
the simple past and pluperfect, while still maintain-
ing that these tenses play different roles in discourse,
by ensuring that different default rules for discourse
attachment apply. We pursue such an analysis of
the pluperfect here, because in contrast to Hamann
(1989), it enables us to provide a uniform semantics
of tense which explains why the simple past and plu-
perfect are equivalent in sentences containing tempo-
ral connectives, but different in discourse (see Las-
carides and Asher 1992).
The logical forms of (9) and (10) are respectively
(9&apos;) and (10&apos;).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.515400666666667">
(9) John greeted Max
e,t
(9&apos;) greet(j,in,e)
hold(e,t)
t now
(10) John had greeted Max
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995718">
In (9), the discourse referent e is a John greeting
Max event, which holds at the time t preceding now.
In (10&apos;), s is the consequent state of the event of
John greeting Max, and it holds at the time I which
precedes now. So our semantics of the perfect is like
that in Moens and Steedman (1988): a perfect trans-
forms an event into a consequent state, and asserts
that the consequent state holds. The pluperfect of
a state, such as (11), therefore, is assumed to first
undergo a transformation into an event.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.662891">
(11) John had loved Mary.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999772833333333">
The event is usually the inceptive reading of the
state—in this case, John started to love Mary—
although this can vary with the context. Then, the
pluperfect asserts that the consequent state of this
event holds—in this case, the consequent state is the
state of John loving Mary itself.
We forego defining the function cs which takes
events to consequent states here for reasons of space,
but see Lascarides (1988) and Blackburn and Las-
carides (1992) for a proposed semantics. We do, how-
ever, assume that the following relationship holds be-
tween an event and its consequent state:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988574">
• Consequent States:
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.9996455">
O(Vt)(hold(cs(e),t) —+ (3e)(hold(e,t9 A ti t))
Deit9(hold(e,e) (3t)(hold(cs(e),t) At&apos; I))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999868714285714">
So a consequent state holds if and only if the event
holds at an earlier time. This relationship means
that (9&apos;) and (10&apos;) are truth conditionally equivalent,
under the usual assumption that time is dense. They
only differ in terms of which eventualities are avail-
able for future anaphoric reference. This equivalence
is in sharp contrast to all Reichenbachian treatments
of the tenses.
The main eventuality in (10) is the consequent
state s of John having greeted Max. But sometimes
in discourse attachment it is useful to refer in the
rules of attachment to the event of John greeting
Max itself, which is embedded in (10&apos;). To do this,
we define a function ev on eventualities:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.934261333333333">
e&apos; if e = cs(e9
ev(e) =

5 The Pragmatics of the Pluperfect
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999805705882353">
We now show how the discourse role of the pluperfect
can be captured. We argued earlier that the range
of possibilities for connecting a pluperfect clause to
a simple past tensed one is smaller than the range
of possibilities allowed for connecting a simple past
tensed clause to a simple past tensed one (cf. (3) vs.
(4)). We will show that to account for the above
data, the discourse relations permitted between a
simple past and pluperfect are exactly Elaboration,
Explanation, Parallel and Contrast. This would be
what one would intuitively expect, for these are the
only discourse relations we consider that are compat-
ible with a backwards movement of time in discourse,
and the pluperfect in general indicates this temporal
structure.
We represent this constraint as defeasible knowl-
edge, for (12) is an exception:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.887718333333333">

the station by 9:15am.
CCT states that if a pluperfect clause /3 is to be at-
tached to a simple past tensed clause a, then the
discourse relation between them must be defined by
Cpp, which is the condition that the consequent state
described in the pluperfect must include the eventu-
ality described in the simple past., and furthermore.

their semantics. The temporal condition of inclusion
imposed by Cpp ensures that, if the discourse rela-
tion between a stative simple past sentence and the
pluperfect one is Parallel or Contrast, then the back-
wards movement of time between the eventualities
described still holds, as we will see shortly.

5.1 A Simple Example

(13) Max stood up. John had greeted him.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999365333333333">
In the interpretation of (13), the rules that apply are:
Narration, States Overlap and CCT. By the Pen-
guin Principle, one infers that the consequent state
of greeting and standing up overlap (by States Over-
lap), and that the clauses are related by Cpp. In addi-
tion, the Greeting Law below captures the intuition
that if a standing up and a greeting are connected,
and moreover, we know that the connection is Cpp,
then in the absence of information to the contrary,
the relation Explanation is preferred in that context
(for out of the four choices, John&apos;s greeting Max ex-
plaining why Max stood up is the most plausible).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.72964">
• Greeting Law:

Now Background and the Greeting Law apply, and
one infers Background(a, )3) and Explanation(a, 13).2
So the consequent state of the greeting is in force
when Max stands up, and the greeting explains why
Max stood up. Thus CCT helps us model the differ-
ence between (7) and (13).
CCT overcomes a flaw in the semantics of the plu-
perfect presented in (Lascarides and Asher in press);
there, the constraint was presented as indefeasible,
and consequently was unable to explain (12). Mak-
ing CCT defeasible has also changed the inference
pattern underlying the analysis of (13). Whereas in
Lascarides and Asher (in press) Cpp(a, fl) is inferred
monotonically from the premises by modus ponens;
here, the inference pattern is the Penguin Principle.

entering a room means that we don&apos;t have a law like
the Greeting Law which allows us to infer which re-
lation permitted by Cpp IS most plausible. So we
fail to infer which of the four permitted discourse
relations holds for (4). And we assume that know-
ing one of a set of discourse relations must hold, but
not being able to infer which actually holds, is suffi-
cient grounds for incoherence. The Nixon Diamond
mentioned earlier, which leads to incoherence, is a
specific case of this.
Now consider text (5).
(5) Max poured himself a cup of coffee. He had
entered the room feeling depressed, but now
he felt much better.
The default assumption in DICE is that one con-
structs the DRss for whole sentences before one at-
tempts discourse attachment. Using rules for con-
structing DRss, the logical forms of the sentences in
(5) are respectively a and P.

The conditions that the event el of pouring coffee
overlaps with the state S2 of having entered the room
arises from the discourse use of now in /3. Now
we must relate ,3 to a with a discourse relation.
The rules that apply are States Overlap and Nar-
ration. CCT does not apply, because we are not re-
lating a pluperfect clause to a simple past tensed
one. By the Cascaded Penguin Principle, we infer
Background(a, [3). Thus the second sentence in (5)
describes the background circumstances when Max
poured himself the coffee. Unlike (4), we do no have
a situation where we fail to infer which of the per-
mitted set of discourse relations holds, and so (5) is
coherent.

point, CCT won&apos;t apply, and so as in (5), we don&apos;t

5.3 Parallel and Contrast
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994384637500001">
We now give an example of a text in which the rela-
tion Contrast occurs together with a change in tense
from the simple past to the pluperfect.
(14) John was lazy now. But he had worked very
hard for several years.
When analysing (14), SDRT will yield two con-
stituents a and representing the respective sen-
tences. The presence of the particle but forces a con-
trast relation between a and 0, but an incoherent
SDRS may result if the relation is not verified by the
semantic content and structure of the constituents
themselves.
The semantics of Parallel and Contrast are
explored in depth in Asher (1993). Briefly,
Paralleka, 0) or Contrast(a, 13) hold just in case the
constituents a and have a particular semantic
structure and content. The semantic structure re-
quired by Parallel and Contrast is defined in terms
of embedding trees. Each constituent has an embed-
ding tree, which depicts the hierarchical structure of
the constituent SDRSS and the hierarchical structure
of the DRss in the sDRss. The embedding trees for
the two constituents a and fl of (14) are given below.
The embedded DRS If in the embedding tree for
represents the subms that characterizes the event of
working hard introduced by the pluperfect.
Briefly, Paralleka, /3) requires that there is a pair-
ing of nodes in the embedding trees of a and such
that each pair contains two semantically and struc-
turally similar objects. Contrast(a, 13), on the other
hand, involves a pairing of nodes from the embed-
ding tree of a and the embedding tree of f3, such
that at least some pairs contain structurally similar
but semantically dissimilar objects. Similarity and
dissimilarity are exhibited by means of an assignment
of polarities (+, —) to nodes. Both nodes get + when
they are similar, one gets + and the other — when
they are dissimilar. Given a pragmatic constraint of
novelty or informativeness, no two constituents can
be perfectly parallel.
Echoing the distinction between topic and focus
or given information and new, Asher (1993) isolates
for each constituent a theme; the constraints on pos-
sible themes are specified in (Asher 1993). Themes
may contain arguments and conditions of the spRss
in question; in general, the more of the conditions of
a constituent that a theme covers the stronger the
parallel or contrast relation it supports. Parallelism
between two constituents is maximized when there
is a common theme and it is as maximal as is com-
patible with informativeness. Contrast is maximally
plausible when themes are complementary or even
contraries. Plausible contrast is defined with respect
to CE: A plausibly contrasts with B if the KB entails
A&gt; —43 or B &gt;
In our example (14) above, the theme of a that
is maximal with respect to supporting Contrast
under the mapping of nodes suggested below is
lazy(eit j) while the corresponding theme of )6&apos; is
work-hard(e2, j). When paired together the KB im-
plies that they are plausibly contrastive, assuming
that world knowledge is stated as intuitions would
dictate. Thus, contrasting polarities are assigned to
the paired nodes and Contrast(a, f3) is verified, as
is required by the presence of but. Thus, the SDRS
coherently supports Contrast.
Contrast does not determine any temporal order
by itself. However, Contrast is compatible with
Cpp(a, )3), which is inferred in DICE by the Penguin
Principle. Cpp(a,13) will force us to conclude that
the consequent state ep includes ea, which is the
state of John being lazy. Because of the Consequent
States axiom, we can infer from this that the event
of working hard precedes John being lazy. In addi-
tion, Contrast is compatible with Background, and
so in this particular case DICE will also force us to
infer Background(a, 13), since (i) ep is a state, (ii) by
States Overlap, ep by default overlaps ea, and (iii)
by Background, this overlap will by default imply
Background(a,13).

includes a representation of their telic roles, which
intuitively define the purpose of the artifact. We
assume that the telic role of a telephone is to have a
conversation. This telic role invokes three thematic
roles, identified below by x (the speaker), p (the thing
that&apos;s said), and y (the listener).

This lexical information influences discourse attach-
ment: upon attempting to attach 13 to a, the reader
infers that Mme Dupont can fill the role x, and so by
default, she does. Having identified Mme Dupont as
filling this role, the rule Elaboration below applies.
Elaboration captures the intuition that if 13 is to be
attached to a with a discourse relation, and 13 iden-
tifies a role in a, then normally, Elaboration(a, )3)
holds.

By the Penguin Principle on Narration and Elabora-
tion, Elaboration(a, ft) is inferred.
Now the task is to update this SDRS with 7: a
and 16 are both open constituents. Caenepeel (1989)
argues that if the discourse context induces a psycho-
logical perspective of a protagonist x, and the clause
currently being processed is stative, then that cur-
rent clause is interpreted with respect to x&apos;s point
of view. In this example, the context provided by
a does induce a psychological perspective because
the above telic role invokes the propositional atti-
tude said that. Furthermore, 7 is in the pluperfect,
and therefore is stative. This motivates Caenepeel&apos;s
Axiom below: it states that a pluperfect sentence 7

sitional attitude ti) invoked by a:

<bodyText confidence="0.999922882352941">
Now consider the reasoning behind attaching 7
to the preceding open constituent a. The rules
that apply are Narration, States Overlap, CCT and
Caenepeel&apos;s Axiom. Nothing in the reader&apos;s KB con-
flicts with the consequent of Caenepeel&apos;s Axiom, and
so its consequent is inferred; i.e., 7 identifies p. CCT
conflicts with Narration, and so Cpp(a, 7) is inferred
by the Penguin Principle. Because 7 identifies p,
Elaboration applies, and whilst conflicting with Nar-
ration, it&apos;s more specific, and so Elaboration(a, 7) is
inferred. Elaboration(a, /3) entails a 4 )3 by Elabo-
ration&apos;s semantics in SDRT. So in attaching 7 to 13,
Continuation fires and Continuation(/3, 7) is inferred.
The full representation of (6) is given in figure 1.
The telic role for telephone has been identified, and
so say(x,p, so) is added to the DRS representing a. ft
and y&apos;s DRS conditions then identify the roles: d = x

in 13 (i.e., Mme Dupont is the speaker on the phone),
and p C 7 in 7 (i.e., what was said over the phone
is denoted by ay). So, a contains a propositional atti-
tude of saying, which given the other DRss, holds be-
tween Mme Dupont and the proposition denoted by
7.3 Thus the representation of (6) encodes the per-
spective shift that occurs when interpreting 7, and
so solves the Perspective Problem. And note that
elaborations can actually affect the truth conditions
of pass by specifying arguments of event types: in
this case, recognising the elaboration enabled d = x
and p C -y to be added to the DRS conditions.

One infers Elaboration between (la) and each of the
pluperfect clauses (lb), (1c) and (1d) using a similar
strategy to that outlined in the analysis of (13). We
now examine in detail how the pluperfect clauses are
related to each other. (lb) is an open clause to (1c),
and just as in (8), Background is inferred via the Cas-
caded Penguin Principle: the pair of conflicting laws
are States Overlap and Narration and Background
and Narration. Continuation also applies, given the
Elaboration relations already inferred, and so Con-
tinuation is inferred; Continuation conflicting with
neither Background nor Narration.4 A similar line
of reasoning applies when attaching (1d) to the open
(lc), and so one infers Background and Continuation
to relate these constituents as well. Finally, further
pragmatic knowledge that is encoded in DICE form a
Nixon Diamond when attempting to attach (le) to
(1d) thus inducing a discourse pop to (la) (we omit
the details of this here). Thus the discourse structure

sitional attitudes in DRT, outlined in Asher (1986),
Kamp (1991b) and Zeevat (1986).

<bodyText confidence="0.999564714285714">
All we have inferred for (lb-d) is that the conse-
quent states overlap; this doesn&apos;t constrain the rel-
ative starts of the states. So the events described
in the pluperfect clauses remain unordered, in agree-
ment with intuitions.
A more specific rule than States Overlap, if con-
flicting with it, may induce orderings among the plu-
perfect clauses. In the analysis of (2), we assume
there are more specific rules than States Overlap,
that convey (a) the pragmatic effects of list-type dis-
course structures; and (b) knowledge concerning the
normal course of events when climbing a mountain.
These rules favour Narration being inferred, by de-
fault. And by the Penguin Principle, these laws deem
States Overlap irrelevant, and so we will infer Nar-
ration, rather than Background, between the pluper-
fect clauses in (2). Narration imposes precedence
relations between the consequent states, and so the
textual order of the events matches their temporal
order. Thus DICE provides the means to solve the
Interaction Problem.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95302324">
We have solved some critical problems about the
way the pluperfect tense affects the temporal struc-
ture and rhetorical structure of narrative text. We
have argued that contrary to the Reichenbachian ap-
proach, the discourse role of the pluperfect must take
the reader&apos;s background knowledge into account. We
have provided an analysis in which the pluperfect is
viewed as a syntactic discourse marker, which indi-
cates that only a restricted set of discourse relations
are permitted in order to attach the current clause to
the preceding text. We viewed the simple past and
pluperfect as sententially equivalent, although they
play distinct discourse roles because of the different
constraints they impose on coherent discourse.
When attaching a pluperfect sentence to a simple
past tensed one, the task is to infer which of the
four discourse relations Explanation, Parallel, Con-
trast or Elaboration hold. Information about causa-
tion can be used to infer Explanation. Information
about structural and semantic similarities and dis-
similarities can be used to infer Parallel and Con-
trast. And information obtained from the lexicon
can be used to infer Elaboration. For example, the
le

lexicon provides potential thematic roles which the
pluperfect clause can identify: if it does, then this re-
sults in an Elaboration at the discourse level. In this
sense, the pluperfect provides a forum in which to
explore how information at the lexical level interacts
with information at the discourse level.
In the light of this, analysing the pluperfect re-
quires an integrated account of lexical and discourse
processing. But this is beyond the scope of this pa-
per. Further research must be pursued in lexical se-
mantics, that addresses the problem of how rhetori-
cal information influences lexical processing. Like-
wise, the theory of discourse attachment must be
augmented with a detailed account of how informa-
tion flows from the lexicon to the textual level. Both
of these issues are explored in (Asher and Lascarides
1993).

In SDRT, an NL text is represented by an SDRS, which is a pair of sets containing respectively: the DRSS or mass representing respectively sentences or text segments, and discourse relations between them. These structures are constructed in a dynamic, incremental fashion. The default assumption is that the sentence boundary marks the unit of information to be attached to the SDRS for the preceding discourse. Discourse relations modelled after those proposed by Hobbs (1985) and Thompson and Mann (1987) link together the constituents of an SDRS. We will use seven discourse relations: Narration, Elaboration, Explanation, Background, Continuation, Parallel and Contrast. The first four of these constrain temporal structure: Narration entails that the descriptive order of events matches their temporal order; an Explanation or Elaboration entail they mismatch; and Background entails temporal overlap. The recursive nature of swiss gives discourse structures a hierarchical configuration. Certain discourse relations in an SDRS impose a hierarchical structure; these subor</context>

A third problem with the Reichenbachian account of tense is that the purely temporal specification fails to explain why the pluperfect clause can initiate a perspective shift such as those that occur in free indirect style, where the control over the proposition shifts from the author to a character in the text (Leech and Short 1981, Quirk et al. 1985). For example, consider text (6), taken from Nakhimovsky (1988): (6) a. The telephone rang. b. It was Mme Dupont. c. Her husband had eaten too many oysters for lunch. d. The doctor recommended a change in lifestyle (6c) initiates free indirect style: Control over the proposition in (6c) is shifted from the author to Mme Dupont, because in contrast to (6b), (6c) reports Mme Dupont &apos;s perceptions (of what was said over the phone). The pluperfect plays a crucial role in creating free indirect style in (6), for replacing it with the simple past would mean that the author&apos;s perspective is maintained: (6) c&apos;.

The pluperfect of a state, such as (11), therefore, is assumed to first undergo a transformation into an event. (11) John had loved Mary. The event is usually the inceptive reading of the state—in this case, John started to love Mary— although this can vary with the context. Then, the pluperfect asserts that the consequent state of this event holds—in this case, the consequent state is the state of John loving Mary itself. We forego defining the function cs which takes events to consequent states here for reasons of space, but see Lascarides (1988) and Blackburn and Lascarides (1992) for a proposed semantics. We do, however, assume that the following relationship holds between an event and its consequent state: • Consequent States: O(Vt)(hold(cs(e),t) —+ (3e)(hold(e,t9 A ti t)) Deit9(hold(e,e) (3t)(hold(cs(e),t) At&apos; I)) So a consequent state holds if and only if the event holds at an earlier time. This relationship means that (9&apos;) and (10&apos;) are truth conditionally equivalent, under the usual assumption that time is dense. They only differ in terms of which eventualities are available for future anaphoric reference. This equivalence is in sharp contrast to all Reichenbachi</context>

Hobbs 1985, Lascarides and Asher 1991), and resolving the conflicts is arbitrary unless supported by an underlying logical consequence relation. 3 A Description of SDRT and DICE We start with a brief overview of SDRT and DICE. SDRT (Asher 1993) takes the basic building blocks of discourse structure to be propositions with a dynamic content, which are represented as DRss—the representation scheme in Kamp&apos;s (1981) DRT. However, discourse relations may also obtain between more complex structures—segmented DRss (sDRss), which are defined recursively. In SDRT, an NL text is represented by an SDRS, which is a pair of sets containing respectively: the DRSS or mass representing respectively sentences or text segments, and discourse relations between them. These structures are constructed in a dynamic, incremental fashion. The default assumption is that the sentence boundary marks the unit of information to be attached to the SDRS for the preceding discourse. Discourse relations modelled after those proposed </context>

A third problem with the Reichenbachian account of tense is that the purely temporal specification fails to explain why the pluperfect clause can initiate a perspective shift such as those that occur in free indirect style, where the control over the proposition shifts from the author to a character in the text (Leech and Short 1981, Quirk et al. 1985). For example, consider text (6), taken from Nakhimovsky (1988): (6) a. The telephone rang. b. It was Mme Dupont. c. Her husband had eaten too many oysters for lunch. d. The doctor recommended a change in lifestyle (6c) initiates free indirect style: Control over the proposition in (6c) is shifted from the author to Mme Dupont, because in contrast to (6b), (6c) reports Mme Dupont &apos;s perceptions (of what was said over the phone). The pluperfect plays a crucial role in creating free indirect style in (6), for replacing it with the simple past would mean that the author&apos;s perspective is maintained: (6) c&apos;.
