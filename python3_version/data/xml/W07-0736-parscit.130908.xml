The paper proposes formulating MT evalu-
ation as a ranking problem, as is often done
in the practice of assessment by human. Un-
der the ranking scenario, the study also in-
vestigates the relative utility of several fea-
tures. The results show greater correlation
with human assessment at the sentence level,
even when using an n-gram match score as
a baseline feature. The feature contributing
the most to the rank order correlation be-
tween automatic ranking and human assess-
ment was the dependency structure relation
rather than BLEU score and reference lan-
guage model feature.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99996368">
In recent decades, alongside the growing research
on Machine Translation (MT), automatic MT evalu-
ation has become a critical problem for MT system
developers, who are interested in quick turnaround
development cycles. The state-of-the-art automatic
MT evaluation is an n-gram based metric repre-
sented by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) and its vari-
ants. Ever since its creation, the BLEU score has
been the gauge of Machine Translation system eval-
uation. Nevertheless, the research community has
been largely aware of the deficiency of the BLEU
metric. BLEU captures only a single dimension
of the vitality of natural languages: a candidate
translation gets acknowledged only if it uses ex-
actly the same lexicon as the reference translation.
Natural languages, however, are characterized by
their extremely rich mechanisms for reproduction
via a large number of syntactic, lexical and semantic
rewriting rules. Although BLEU has been shown
to correlate positively with human assessments at
the document level (Papineni et al., 2001), efforts to
improve state-of-the-art MT require that human as-
sessment be approximated at sentence level as well.
Researchers report the BLEU score at document
level in order to combat the sparseness of n-grams
in BLEU scoring. But, ultimately, document-level
MT evaluation has to be pinned down to the gran-
ularity of the sentence. Unfortunately, the corre-
lation between human assessment and BLEU score
at sentence level is extremely low (Liu et al., 2005,
2006). While acknowledging the appealing simplic-
ity of BLEU as a way to access one perspective of an
MT candidate translation’s quality, we observe the
following facts of n-gram based MT metrics. First,
they may not reflect the mechanism of how human
beings evaluate sentence translation quality. More
specifically, optimizing BLEU does not guarantee
the optimization of sentence quality approved by hu-
man assessors. Therefore, BLEU is likely to have
a low correlation with human assessment at sen-
tence level for most candidate translations. Second,
it is conceivable that human beings are more reli-
able ranking the quality of multiple candidate trans-
lations than assigning a numeric value to index the
quality of the candidate translation even with signif-
icant deliberation. Consequently, a more intuitive
approach for automatic MT evaluation is to repli-
cate the quality ranking ability of human assessors.
Thirdly, the BLEU score is elusive and hard to in-
terpret; for example, what can be concluded for a

candidate translation’s quality if the BLEU score is
0.0168, particularly when we are aware that even
a human translation can receive an embarrassingly
low BLEU score? In light of the discussion above,
we propose an alternative scenario for MT evalua-
tion, where, instead of assigning a numeric score to
a candidate translation under evaluation, we predict
its rank with regard to its peer candidate translations.
This formulation of the MT evaluation task fills the
gap between an automatic scoring function and hu-
man MT evaluation practice. The results from the
current study will not only interest MT system eval-
uation moderators but will also inform the research
community about which features are useful in im-
proving the correlation between human rankings and
automatic rankings.

2.1 Data and Human Annotation Reliability

<bodyText confidence="0.998964423076923">
We use two data sets for the experiments:
the test data set from the LDC MTC corpus
(LDC2003T171) and the data set from the MT eval-
uation workshop at ACL052. Both data sets are for
Chinese-English language pairs and each has four
reference translations and seven MT system transla-
tions as well as human assessments for fluency and
adequacy on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the
best quality. For the LDC2003T17 data, human as-
sessments exist for only three MT systems; for the
ACL05 workshop data, there are human assessments
for all seven MT systems. Table 1 summarizes the
information from these two data sets.
The Kappa scores (Cohen, 1960) for the human
assessment scores are negative, both for fluency and
adequacy, indicating that human beings are not con-
sistent when assigning quality scores to the candi-
date translations. We have much sympathy with a
concern expressed in (Turian, 2003) that “Automatic
MT evaluation cannot be faulted for poor correlation
with the human judges, when the judges do not cor-
relate well each other.”To determine whether human
assessor might be more consistent when ranking
pairs of sentences, we examined the “ranking con-
sistency score”of the human assessment data for the
LDC2003T17 data. For this consistency score, we

are only concerned with whether multiple judges are
consistent in terms of which sentence of the two sen-
tences is better: we are not concerned with the quan-
titative difference between judges. Since some sen-
tences are judged by three judges while others are
judged by only two judges, we calculated the consis-
tency scores under both circumstances, referred to as
“Consistent 2”and “Consistent 3”in the following ta-
ble. For “Consistent 2”, for every pair of sentences,
where sentence 1 is scored higher (or lower or equal)
than sentence 2 by both judges, then the two judges
are deemed consistent. For “Consistent 3”, the pro-
portion of sentences that achieved the above consis-
tency from triple judges is reported. Additionally,
we also considered a consistency rate that excludes
pairs for which only one judge says sentence 1 is bet-
ter and the other judge(s) say(s) sentence 2 is better.
We call these “Consistent 2 with tie”and “Consistent
3 with tie”. From the rank consistency scores in Ta-
ble 2, we observe that two annotators are more con-
sistent with the relative rankings for sentence pairs
than with the absolute quality scores. This finding
further supports the task of ranking MT candidate
sentences as more reliable than the one of classify-
ing the quality labels.

As discussed in the previous section, it is difficult for
human assessors to perform MT candidate transla-
tion evaluation with fine granularity (e.g., using real-
valued numeric score). But humans’ assessments
are relatively reliable for judgments of quality rank-
ing using a coarser ordinal scale, as we have seen
above. Several approaches for automatically assign-
ing quality scores to candidate sentences are avail-
able, including classification, regression or ranking,
of which ranking is deemed to be a more appropri-
ate approach. Nominalize the quality scores and for-
mulating the task as a classification problem would
result in a loss of the ordinal information encoded
in the different scores. Additionally, the low Kappa
scores in the human annotation reliability analysis
reported above also confirms our previous specula-
tion that a classification approach is less appropriate.
Regression would be more reasonable than classifi-
cation because it preserves the ordinal information
in the quality labels, but it also inappropriately im-

poses interval scaling onto the quality labels. In
contrast, ranking considers only the relative rank-
ing information from human labels and does not im-
pose any extra information onto the quality labels
assigned by human beings.
The specific research question addressed in this
paper is three-fold: First, in addition to investigating
the correlation between automatic numeric scoring
and human assessments, is ranking of peer candidate
translations an alternative way of examining correla-
tion that better suits the state of affairs of human an-
notation? Second, if the answer to the above ques-
tion is yes, can better correlation be achieved with
human assessment under the new task scenario? Fi-
nally, in addition to n-gram matching, which other
knowledge sources can combat and even improve
the rank order correlation? The process of rank-
ing is a crucial technique in Information Retrieval
(IR) where search engines rank web pages depend-
ing on their relevance to a query. In this work, sen-
tence level MT evaluation is considered as a ranking
problem. For all candidate translations of the same
source Chinese sentence, we predict their transla-
tion quality ranks. We evaluate the ranker by Spear-
man’s rank order correlation coefficient between hu-
man ranks and predicted ranks described by the fol-
lowing formula (Siegel,1956):
where D is the difference between each pair of ranks
and N is the number of candidates for ranking.

Papineni et al.(2001) pioneered the automatic MT
evaluation study, which scores translation quality via
n-gram matching between the candidate and refer-
ence translations. Following the growing awareness
of the deficiency of n-gram based automatic MT
evaluation, many studies attempted to improve upon
n-gram based metrics (Zhou et al., 2006; Liu, et
al., 2005,2006) as well as propose ways to evaluate
MT evaluation metrics (Lin, et al. 2004). Previous
studies, however, have focused on MT evaluation at
the document level in order to fight n-gram sparse-
ness problem. While document level correlation
provides us with a general impression of the qual-
ity of an MT system, researchers desire to get more
informative diagnostic evaluation at sentence level
to improve the MT system instead of just an over-
all score that does not provide details. Recent years
have seen several studies investigating MT evalu-
ation at the sentence level (Liu et al., 2005,2006;
Quirk, 2004). The state-of-the-art sentence level
correlations reported in previous work between hu-
man assessments and automatic scoring are around
0.20. Kulesza et al.(2004) applied Support Vec-
tor Machine classification learning to sentence level
MT evaluation and reported improved correlation
with human judgment over BLEU. However, the
classification taxonomy in their work is binary, be-
ing either machine translation or human translation.
Additionally, as discussed above, the inconsistency
from the human annotators weakens the legitimacy
of the classification approach. Gamon et al.(2005)
reported a study of English to French sentence-level
MT evaluation without reference translations. In or-
der to improve on the correlation between human as-
sessments and the perplexity score alone, they com-
bined a perplexity score with a classification score
obtained from an SVM binary classifier distinguish-
ing machine-translated sentences from human trans-

lations. The results showed that even the combi-
nation of the above two scores cannot outperform
BLEU.
To sum up, very little consideration has been
taken in previous research as to which learning ap-
proach is better motivated and justified by the state
of affairs of human annotation reliability. Presum-
ably, research that endeavors to emulate human per-
formance on tasks that demontrate good inter-judge
reliability is most useful.
a learning approach that is better supported by
human annotation reliability can alleviate the noise
from human assessments and therefore achieve more
reliable correlations.

Ranking peer candidate sentence translations is a
task in which the translation instances are classi-
fied into a number of ranks. This is a canonical or-
dinal regression scenario, which differs from stan-
dard classification and metric regression. For imple-
mentation, we use the Ranking SVM of SVMlight
(Joachims, 2004), which was originally developed
to rank the web pages returned upon a certain query
in search engines. Given an instance of a candidate
translation, Ranking SVM assigns it a score based
on:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998266">

<bodyText confidence="0.999408777777778">
where W represents a vector of weights (Xu et al.,
2005). The higher the value of U(x), the better x is as
a candidate translation. In an ordinal regression, the
values of U(x) are mapped into intervals correspond-
ing to the ordinal categories. An instance falling
into one interval is classified into the corresponding
translation quality. In ranking experiments, we use
the Ranking SVM scores to rank the candidate sen-
tences under evaluation.

N-gram matching is certainly an important cri-
terion in some cases for evaluating the translation
quality of a candidate translation. We use the BLEU
score calculated by the BLEU score script from
NIST for this feature.
As has been observed by many researchers,
BLEU fails to capture any non n-gram based match-
ing between the reference and candidate transla-
tions. We carried out a pair-wise experiment on
four reference translations from the LDC2003T17
test data, where we took one reference sentence as
the reference and the other three references as can-
didate translations. Presumably, since the candidate
sentences are near-optimal translations, the BLEU
scores obtained in such a way should be close to
1. But our analysis shows a mean BLEU of only
0.1456398, with a standard deviation of 0.1522381,
which means that BLEU is not very predictive of
sentence level evaluation. The BLEU score is, how-
ever, still informative in judging the average MT
system’s translation.

structure (DS) types:

Besides the consideration of the presence of cer-
tain lexical items, DS captures information as to
how the lexical items are assembled into a good sen-
tence. By using their dependency relation match for
ranking the quality of peer translations, we assume
that the dependency structure in the source language
should be well preserved in the target language and
that multiple translations of the same source sen-
tence should significantly share dependency struc-
tures. Liu et al.(2005) make use of dependency
structure in sentence level machine translation eval-
uation in the form of headword chains, which are
lexicalized dependency relations. We propose that
unlexicalized dependency relations can also be in-
formative. Previous research has shown that key de-
pendency relations tend to have a strong correspon-
dence between Chinese and English (Zhou et al.,
2001). More than 80 % of subject-verb, adjective-
noun and adverb-verb dependency relations were
able to be mapped, although verb-object DS map-
ping is weaker at a rate of 64.8%. In our paper, we
considered three levels of matching for dependency
relation triplets, where a triplet consists of the DS
type and the two lexical items as the arguments.
We used an in-house dependency parser to extract
the dependency relations from the sentences. Figure
1 illustrates how dependency relation matching can
go beyond n-gram matching. We calculated 15 DS
scores for each sentence correponding to the counts
of match for the 5 DS types at the 3 different levels.

be tuned to reflect n-gram probabilities for both a
narrowed scope as well as a general scope covering
the distribution of n-gram probabilities of the whole
language. In the BLEU calculation, the candidate
sentence is evaluated against an extremely local lan-
guage model of merely the reference sentence. We
speculate that a language model that stands in be-
tween such an immediate local language model and
the large general English language model could help
capture the variation of lexical and even structural
selections in the translations by using information
beyond the scope of the local sentence. Addition-
ally, this language model could represent the style
of a certain group of translators in a certain domain
on the genre of news articles. To pursue such a lan-
guage model, we explore a language model that is
trained on all sentences in the four references. We
obtain the perplexity score of each candidate sen-
tence based on the reference language model. The
perplexity score obtained this way reflects the de-
gree to which a candidate translation can be gen-
erated from the n-gram probability distribution of
the whole collection of sentences in the four refer-
ences. It adds new information to BLEU because it
not only compares the candidate sentence to its cor-
responding reference sentence but also reaches out
to other sentences in the current document and other
documents on the same topics. We choose perplex-
ity over the language model score because the per-
plexity score is normalized with regard to the length
of the sentence; that is, it does not favor sentences of
relatively shorter length.
In our ranking experiments, for training, both the
seven MT translations and the four reference trans-
lations of the same source sentence are evaluated
as “candidate” translations, and then each of these
eleven sentences is evaluated against the four ref-
erence sentences in turn. The BLEU score of each
of these sentences is calculated with multiple refer-
ences. Each dependency score is the average score
of the four references. For the reference language
model feature, the perplexity score is used for each
sentence.
Conceptually, the reference language model and
dependency structure features are more relevant to
the fluency of the sentence than to the adequacy.

searchers that a good evalutation metric should rank
reference translation as higher than machine trans-

improved correlation between human scoring and
automatic ranking at sentence level compared to the
state-of-the-art sentence level correlation for fluency
score of approximately 0.202 found previously (Liu
et al., 2006). When the ranking task is performed on
a mixture of MT sentences and human translations,
dependency structure and reference language model
perplexity scores sequentially improve on BLEU in
increasing the correlation. When the ranking task
is performed only on MT system output sentences,
dependency structure still significantly outperforms
BLEU in increasing the correlation, and the refer-
ence language model, even trained on a small num-
ber of sentences, demonstrates utility equal to that
of BLEU. The dependency structure feature proves
to have robust utility in informing fluency quality
in both scenarios, even with noise from the depen-
dency parser, likely because a dependency triplet
with inaccurate arguments is still rewarded as a type
match or partial match. Additionally, the feature is
reward-based and not penalty-based. We only re-
ward matches and do not penalize mismatches, such
that the impact of the noise from the MT system and
the dependency parser is weakened.

It is trivial to retrain the ranking model and test on
a new year’s data. But we speculate that a model
trained from a different data set can have almost the
same ranking power as a model trained on the same
data set. Therefore, we conducted an experiment
where we trained the ranking model on the ACL
2005 workshop data and test on the LDC2003T17
data. We do not need to retrain the ranking SVM
model; we only need to retrain the reference lan-
guage model on the multiple references from the
new year’s data to obtain the perplexity scores.
Because LDC2003T17 has human assessments for
only three MT systems, we test on the three system
outputs plus a human translation chosen randomly
from the four reference translations. The results in
Table 5 show an encouraging rank order correlation
with human assessments. Similar to training and
testing on within-year data, both dependency struc-
ture and perplexity scores achieve higher correlation
than the BLEU score. Combining BLEU and depen-
dency structure achieves the best correlation.

Previously, most researchers working on MT evalu-
ation studied the correlation between automatic met-
ric and human assessment on the granularity of the
document to mitigate n-gram sparseness. Presum-
ably, good correlation at sentence level should lead
to good correlation at document level but not vice
versa. Table 6 reports the correlations using the
model trained on the 2005 workshop data and tested
on the 100 documents of the LDC 2003 data. Com-
paring these correlations with the correlations re-
ported in the previous section, we see that using the
same model, the document level rank order corre-
lation is substantially higher than the sentence level
correlation, with the dependency structure showing
the highest utility.

cess to better inform the optimization of weights of
the different factors for SMT models. Our ranking
experiments show a better correlation with human
assessments at sentence level for fluency score com-
pared to the previous non-ranking scenario, even
with BLEU as the baseline feature. On top of BLEU,
both the dependency structure and reference lan-
guage model have shown encouraging utility for dif-
ferent testing scenarios. Looking toward the fu-
ture work, more features could be explored, e.g., a
parsing-based score of each candidate sentence and
better engineering for dependency triplet extraction.
Additionally, the entire research community on MT
evaluation would benefit from a systematic and de-
tailed analysis of real data that can provide a quanti-
tative breakdown of the proportions of different “op-
erations” needed to rewrite one sentence to another.
Such an effort will guide MT evaluation researchers
to decide which features to focus on.

Under the ranking scenario, the study also investigates the relative utility of several features. The results show greater correlation with human assessment at the sentence level, even when using an n-gram match score as a baseline feature. The feature contributing the most to the rank order correlation between automatic ranking and human assessment was the dependency structure relation rather than BLEU score and reference language model feature.</abstract>

Both data sets are for Chinese-English language pairs and each has four reference translations and seven MT system translations as well as human assessments for fluency and adequacy on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the best quality. For the LDC2003T17 data, human assessments exist for only three MT systems; for the ACL05 workshop data, there are human assessments for all seven MT systems. Table 1 summarizes the information from these two data sets. The Kappa scores (Cohen, 1960) for the human assessment scores are negative, both for fluency and adequacy, indicating that human beings are not consistent when assigning quality scores to the candidate translations.

Presumably, since the candidate sentences are near-optimal translations, the BLEU scores obtained in such a way should be close to 1. But our analysis shows a mean BLEU of only 0.1456398, with a standard deviation of 0.1522381, which means that BLEU is not very predictive of sentence level evaluation. The BLEU score is, however, still informative in judging the average MT system’s translation. 4.2.2 Dependency Structure Matching Dependency relation information has been widely used in Machine Translation in recent years. Fox (2002) reported that dependency trees correspond better across translation pairs than constituent trees. The information summarization community has also seen successful implementation of ideas similar to the depedency structure. Zhou et al.(2005) and Hovy et al.(2005) reported using Basic Elements (BE) in text summarization and its evaluation. In the current 3We added an extremely small number to both matched ngrams and total number of n-grams. 243 paper, we match a candidate translation with a reference translation on the following five dependency structure (DS) types: • Agent - Verb • Verb - Pati</context>

Previous studies, however, have focused on MT evaluation at the document level in order to fight n-gram sparseness problem. While document level correlation provides us with a general impression of the quality of an MT system, researchers desire to get more informative diagnostic evaluation at sentence level to improve the MT system instead of just an overall score that does not provide details. Recent years have seen several studies investigating MT evaluation at the sentence level (Liu et al., 2005,2006; Quirk, 2004). The state-of-the-art sentence level correlations reported in previous work between human assessments and automatic scoring are around 0.20. Kulesza et al.(2004) applied Support Vector Machine classification learning to sentence level MT evaluation and reported improved correlation with human judgment over BLEU. However, the classification taxonomy in their work is binary, being either machine translation or human translation. Additionally, as discussed above, the inconsistency from the human annotators weakens the legitimacy of the classification approach. Gamon et al.(2005) reported a study</context>
