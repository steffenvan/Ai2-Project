<bodyText confidence="0.995577266666667">
We introduce a new interactive corpus
exploration tool called InfoMagnets. In-
foMagnets aims at making exploratory
corpus analysis accessible to researchers
who are not experts in text mining. As
evidence of its usefulness and usability, it
has been used successfully in a research
context to uncover relationships between
language and behavioral patterns in two
distinct domains: tutorial dialogue
(Kumar et al., submitted) and on-line
communities (Arguello et al., 2006). As
an educational tool, it has been used as
part of a unit on protocol analysis in an
Educational Research Methods course.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999705666666666">
Exploring large text corpora can be a daunting
prospect. This is especially the case for behavioral
researchers who have a vested interest in the latent
patterns present in text, but are less interested in
computational models of text-representation (e.g.
the vector-space model) or unsupervised pattern-
learning (e.g. clustering). Our goal is to provide
this technology to the broader community of learn-
ing scientists and other behavioral researchers who
collect and code corpus data as an important part
of their research. To date none of the tools that are
commonly used in the behavioral research com-
munity, such as HyperResearch, MacShapa, or
Nvivo, which are used to support their corpus
analysis efforts, make use of technology more ad-
vanced than simplistic word counting approaches.
With InfoMagnets, we are working towards bridg-
ing the gap between the text-mining community
and the corpus-based behavioral research commu-
nity. The purpose of our demonstration is to make
the language technologies community more aware
of opportunities for applications of language tech-
nologies to support corpus oriented behavioral re-
search.

InfoMagnet’s novelty is two-fold: First, it pro-
vides an intuitive visual metaphor that allows the
user to get a sense of their data and organize it for
easy retrieval later. This is important during the
sense making stage of corpus analysis work just
before formal coding scheme development begins.
Secondly, it allows the user to interact with cluster-
ing technology, and thus influence its behavior, in
effect introducing human knowledge into the clus-
tering process. Because of this give and take be-
tween the clustering technology and the human

influence, the tool is able to achieve an organiza-
tion of textual units that is not just optimal from an
algorithmic stand-point, but also optimal for the
user’s unique purpose, which non-interactive clus-
tering algorithms are not in general capable of
achieving.
Using visual metaphors to convey to the user
proximity and relations between documents and
automatically generated clusters is not a new tech-
nique (Chalmers and Chitson, 1992; Dubin, 1995;
Wise et al., 1995; Leuski and Allan, 2000; Ras-
mussen and Karypis, 2004). InfoMagnet’s novelty
comes from giving the user more control over the
ultimate clustering organization. The user is able to
incrementally influence the formation and reor-
ganization of cluster centroids and immediately see
the effect on the text-to-cluster assignment. Thus,
the user can explore the corpus in more effective
and meaningful ways.
In what follows, we more concretely elaborate
on InfoMagnet’s functionality and technical de-
tails. We then motivate its usability and usefulness
with a real case study.

2 Functionality
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998712630136987">
Exploring a textual corpus in search of interest-
ing topical patterns that correlate with externally
observable variables is a non-trivial task. Take as
an example the task of characterizing the process
by which students and tutors negotiate with one
another over a chat interface as they navigate in-
structional materials together in an on-line explora-
tory learning environment. A sensible approach is
to segment all dialogue transcripts into topic-
oriented segments and then group the segments by
topic similarity. If done manually, this is a chal-
lenging task in two respects. First, to segment each
dialogue the analyst must rely on their knowledge
of the domain to locate where the focus of the dia-
logue shifts from one topic to the next. This, of
course, requires the analyst to know what to look
for and to remain consistent throughout the whole
set of dialogues. More importantly, it introduces
into the topic analysis a primacy bias. The analyst
may miss important dialogue digressions simply
because they are not expected based on observa-
tions from the first few dialogues viewed in detail.
InfoMagnets addresses these issues by offering
users a constant bird’s eye view of their data. See
Figure 1.
As input, InfoMagnets accepts a corpus of tex-
tual documents. As an option to the user, the docu-
ments can be automatically fragmented into
topically-coherent segments (referred to also as
documents from here on), which then become the
atomic textual unit1. The documents (or topic seg-
ments) are automatically clustered into an initial
organization that the user then incrementally ad-
justs through the interface. Figure 1 shows the ini-
tial document-to-topic assignment that
InfoMagnets produces as a starting point for the
user. The large circles represent InfoMagnets, or
topic oriented cluster centroids, and the smaller
circles represent documents. An InfoMagnet can
be thought of as a set of words representative of a
topic concept. The similarity between the vector
representation of the words in a document and that
of the words in an InfoMagnet translate into attrac-
tion in the two-dimensional InfoMagnet space.
This semantic similarity is computed using Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998).
Thus, a document appears closest to the InfoMag-
net that best represents its topic.
A document that appears equidistant to two In-
foMagnets shares its content equally between the
two represented topics. Topics with lots of docu-
ments nearby are popular topics. InfoMagnets with
only a few documents nearby represent infrequent
topics. Should the user decide to remove an In-
foMagnet, any document with some level of attrac-
tion to that InfoMagnet will animate and reposition
itself based on the topics still represented by the
remaining InfoMagnets. At all times, the In-
foMagnets interface offers the analyst a bird’s eye
view of the entire corpus as it is being analyzed
and organized.
Given the automatically-generated initial topic
representation, the user typically starts by brows-
ing the different InfoMagnets and documents. Us-
ing a magnifying cross-hair lens, the user can view
the contents of a document on the top pane. As
noted above, each InfoMagnet represents a topic
concept through a collection of words (from the
corpus) that convey that concept. Selecting the In-
foMagnet displays this list of words on the left
pane. The list is shown in descending order of im-
portance with respect to that topic. By browsing
each InfoMagnet’s list of words and browsing

nearby documents, the user can start recognizing
topics represented in the InfoMagnet space and can
start labeling those InfoMagnets.
InfoMagnets with only a few neighboring
documents can be removed. Likewise, InfoMag-
nets attracting too many topically-unrelated docu-
ments can be split into multiple topics. The user
can do this semi-automatically (by requesting a
split, and allowing the algorithm to determine
where the best split is) or by manually selecting a
set of terms from the InfoMagnet’s word list and
creating a new InfoMagnet using those words to
represent the new InfoMagnet’s topic. If the user
finds words in an InfoMagnet’s word list that lack
topical relevance, the user can remove them from
InfoMagnet’s word list or from all the InfoMag-
nets’ word lists at once.
Users may also choose to manually assign a seg-
ment to a topic by “snapping” that document to an
InfoMagnet. “Snapping” is a way of overriding the
attraction between the document and other In-
foMagnets. By “snapping” a document to an In-
foMagnet, the relationship between the “snapped”
document and the associated InfoMagnet remains
constant, regardless of any changes made to the
InfoMagnet space subsequently.
If a user would like to remove the influence of a
subset of the corpus from the behavior of the tool,
the user may select an InfoMagnet and all the
documents close to it and place them in the “quar-
antine” area of the interface. When placed in the
quarantine, as when “snapped”, a document’s as-
signment remains unchanged. This feature is used
to free screen space for the user.
If the user opts for segmenting each input dis-
course and working with topic segments rather
than whole documents, an alternative interface al-
lows the user to quickly browse through the corpus
sequentially (Figure 2). By switching between this
view and the bird’s eye view, the user is able to see
where each segment fits sequentially into the larger
context of the discourse it was extracted from. The
user can also use the sequential interface for mak-
ing minor adjustments to topic segment boundaries
and topic assignments where necessary. Once the
user is satisfied with the topic representation in the
space and the assignments of all documents to
those topics, the tool can automatically generate an
XML file, where all documents are tagged with
their corresponding topic labels.

3 Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99964075">
As mentioned previously, InfoMagnets uses La-
tent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to relate documents
to InfoMagnets. LSA is a dimensionality reduction
technique that can be used to compute the semantic
similarity between text spans of arbitrary size. For
a more technical overview of LSA, we direct the
reader to (Landauer et al., 1998).
The LSA space is constructed using the corpus
that the user desires to organize, possibly aug-
mented with some general purpose text (such as
newsgroup data) to introduce more domain-general
term associations. The parameters used in building
the space are set by the user during pre-processing,
so that the space is consistent with the semantic
granularity the user is interested in capturing.
Because documents (or topic-segments) tend to
cover more than one relevant topic, our clustering
approach is based on what are determined heuristi-
cally to be the most important terms in the corpus,
and not on whole documents. This higher granular-
ity allows us to more precisely capture the topics
discussed in the corpus by not imposing the as-
sumption that documents are about a single topic.
First, all terms that occur less than n times and in
less than m documents are removed from consid-
eration2. Then, the remaining terms are clustered
via average-link clustering, using their LSA-based
vector representations and using cosine-correlation
as a vector similarity measure. Our clustering algo-
rithm combines top-down clustering (Bisecting K-
Means) and bottom-up clustering (Agglomerative
Clustering) (Steinbach et al., 2000). This hybrid

<bodyText confidence="0.999969428571428">
clustering approach leverages the speed of bisect-
ing K-means and the greedy search of agglomera-
tive clustering, thus achieving a nice effectiveness
versus efficiency balance.
Cluster centroids (InfoMagnets) and documents
(or topic segments) are all treated as bag-of-words.
Their vector-space representation is the sum of the
LSA vectors of their constituent terms. When the
user changes the topic-representation by removing
or adding a term to an InfoMagnet, a new LSA
vector is obtained by projecting the new bag-of-
words onto the LSA space and re-computing the
cosine correlation between all documents and the
new topic.

InfoMagnets was designed for easy usability by
both computational linguistics and non-technical
users. It has been successfully used by social psy-
chologists working on on-line communities re-
search as well as learning science researchers
studying tutorial dialogue interactions (which we
discuss in some detail here).
Using InfoMagnets, a thermodynamics domain
expert constructed a topic analysis of a corpus of
human tutoring dialogues collected during class-
room study focusing on thermodynamics instruc-
tion (Rosé et al., 2005). Altogether each student’s
protocol was divided into between 10 and 25 seg-
ments such that the entire corpus was divided into
approximately 379 topic segments altogether. Us-
ing InfoMagnets, the domain expert identified 15
distinct topics such that each student covered be-
tween 4 and 11 of these topics either once or mul-
tiple times throughout their interaction.
The topic analysis of the corpus gives us a way
of quickly getting a sense of how tutors divided
their instructional time between different topics of
conversation. Based on this topic analysis of the
human-tutoring corpus, the domain expert de-
signed 12 dialogues, which were then implemented
using a dialogue authoring environment called
TuTalk (Gweon et al., 2005). In a recent very suc-
cessful classroom evaluation, we observed the in-
structional effectiveness of these implemented
tutorial dialogue agents, as measured by pre and
post tests.

It has been successfully used by social psychologists working on on-line communities research as well as learning science researchers studying tutorial dialogue interactions (which we discuss in some detail here). Using InfoMagnets, a thermodynamics domain expert constructed a topic analysis of a corpus of human tutoring dialogues collected during classroom study focusing on thermodynamics instruction (Rosé et al., 2005). Altogether each student’s protocol was divided into between 10 and 25 segments such that the entire corpus was divided into approximately 379 topic segments altogether. Using InfoMagnets, the domain expert identified 15 distinct topics such that each student covered between 4 and 11 of these topics either once or multiple times throughout their interaction. The topic analysis of the corpus gives us a way of quickly getting a sense of how tutors divided their instructional time between different topics of conversation. Based on this topic analysis of the human-tutoring corpus, the domain expe</context>

This higher granularity allows us to more precisely capture the topics discussed in the corpus by not imposing the assumption that documents are about a single topic. First, all terms that occur less than n times and in less than m documents are removed from consideration2. Then, the remaining terms are clustered via average-link clustering, using their LSA-based vector representations and using cosine-correlation as a vector similarity measure. Our clustering algorithm combines top-down clustering (Bisecting KMeans) and bottom-up clustering (Agglomerative Clustering) (Steinbach et al., 2000). This hybrid 2 n and m are parameters set by the user. 255 clustering approach leverages the speed of bisecting K-means and the greedy search of agglomerative clustering, thus achieving a nice effectiveness versus efficiency balance. Cluster centroids (InfoMagnets) and documents (or topic segments) are all treated as bag-of-words. Their vector-space representation is the sum of the LSA vectors of their constituent terms. When the user changes the topic-representation by removing or adding a term to an InfoMagnet, a new LSA vector is obtained by projecting the new bag-ofwords onto the LSA spac</context>
