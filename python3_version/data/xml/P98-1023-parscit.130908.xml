In this paper we present an algorithm to an-
chor floating quantifiers in Japanese, a language
in which quantificational nouns and numeral-
classifier combinations can appear separated
from the noun phrase they quantify. The algo-
rithm differentiates degree and event modifiers
from nouns that quantify noun phrases. It then
finds a suitable anchor for such floating quan-
tifiers. To do this, the algorithm considers the
part of speech of the quantifier and the target,
the semantic relation between them, the case
marker of the antecedent and the meaning of the
verb that governs the two constituents. The al-
gorithm has been implemented and tested in a
rule-based Japanese-to-English machine trans-
lation system, with an accuracy of 76% and a
recall of 97%.

One interesting phenomenon in Japanese is the
fact that quantifiers can appear in two main po-
sitions, as pre-modifier in a noun phrase (1), or
&apos;floating&apos; as adjuncts to the verb phrase, typi-
cally in pre-verbal position (2).1,2

ature.3 Much of the discussion focuses on iden-
tifying the conditions under which a quantifier
can appear in the adjunct position. The expla-
nations range from configurational (Inoue, 1983;
Miyagawa, 1989) to discourse based (Downing,
1996; Alam, 1997), we shall discuss these fur-
ther below. There has been almost no discus-
sion of other floating quantifiers, such as quan-
tificational nouns.
We call the process of identifying the noun
phrase being quantified by a floating quanti-
fier &apos;anchoring&apos; the quantifier. The necessity
of anchoring floating quantifiers for many nat-
ural language processing tasks is widely recog-
nized (Asahioka et al., 1990; Bond et al., 1996),
and is important not only for machine transla-
tion but for the interpretation of Japanese in
general. However, although there are several
NLP systems that incorporate some solution to
the problem of floating quantifiers, to the best
of our knowledge, no algorithm for anchoring
floating quantifiers has been given. We propose
such an algorithm in this paper. The algorithm
uses information about case-marking, sentence
structure, part-of-speech, noun and verb mean-
ing. The algorithm has been implemented and
tested within the Japanese-to-English machine
translation system ALT-J/E (Ikehara et al.,
1991).
The next section *describes the phenomenon
of quantifier float in more detail. We then pro-
pose our algorithm to identify and anchor float-
ing quantifiers in Section 3. The results of im-
plementing the algorithm in ALT-J/E are dis-
3The name &apos;float&apos; comes from early transformational
accounts, where the quantifier was said to &apos;float&apos; out of
the noun phrase. Although this analysis has largely been
abandoned, and we disagree with it, we shall continue
with accepted practice and call a quantifier in the ad-
junct position a floating quantifier.

2 Quantifier float in Japanese
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99914440625">
First we will give a definition of quantifiers. Se-
mantically, quantifiers are elements that serve
to quantify, or enumerate, some target. The tar-
get can be an entity, in which case the number
of objects is quantified, or an action, in which
case the number of events (i.e. iterations of the
action) are quantified. The quantification can
be by a cardinal number, or by a more vague
expression, like several or many.
In Japanese, quantifiers (Q) are mainly re-
alised in two ways: numeral-classifier combi-
nations (XC) and quantificational nouns (N).
Note that these nouns are often treated as ad-
verbs, as they typically function as adjuncts
that modify verbs, a function prototypically car-
ried out by adverbs. They can however head
noun phrases, and take some case-markers, so
we classify them as nouns.
Numeral classifiers form a closed class, al-
though a large one. Japanese and Korean both
have two or three hundred numeral classifiers
(not counting units), although typically indi-
vidual speakers use far less, between 30 and 80
(Downing, 1995, 346).
Syntactically, numeral classifiers are a sub-
class of nouns. The main property distinguish-
ing them from prototypical nouns is that they
cannot stand alone. Typically they postfix
to numerals, forming a quantifier phrase, al-
though they can also combine with the quan-
tificational prefix sti &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; or the interrogative
nani &amp;quot;what&amp;quot;:

(5) nan-biki &amp;quot;how many animals&amp;quot; (Inter-
rogative)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998872916666667">
Semantically, classifiers both classify and
quantify the referent of the noun phrase they
collocate with.
Quantificational nouns, such as takusan
&amp;quot;much/many&amp;quot;, subete &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; and ichibu &amp;quot;some&amp;quot;,
only quantify their targets, there is no classifi-
cation involved.
Numeral classifier combinations appear in
seven major patterns of use (following Asahioka
et al. (1990)) as shown below (T refers to
the quantified target noun phrase, m is a case-
marker):

Noun quantifiers cannot appear in the ap-
positive, attributive, anaphoric and predicative
complement patterns.
In the pre-nominal construction the relation
between the target noun phrase and quantifier
is explicit. For numeral-classifier combinations
the quantification can be of the object denoted
by the noun phrase itself as in (6); or of a sub-
part of it as in (7) (see Bond and Paik (1997) for
a fuller discussion). For nouns, only the object
denoted by the noun itself can be quantified.

In the partitive construction the quantifier re-
stricts a subset of a known amount: e.g., tegami-
no 3-tsi &amp;quot;three of the letters&amp;quot;. This is a very
different construal to the pre-nominal construc-
tion. Only rational quantificational nouns can
appear in the partitive construction. -
The floating construction, on the other hand,
has the same quantificational meaning as the
pre-nominal. Two studies indicate that there
are pragmatic differences (Downing, 1996; Kim,
1995). Pre-nominal constructions typically are
used to introduce important referents, with non-
existential predicates, while floating construc-
tions typically introduce new number informa-
tion. In addition floating constructions are used

when the nominal has other modifiers, and are
more common in spoken text.
We will restrict the following discussion to the
difference between the pre-nominal and floating
uses.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998421">
2.1 Restrictions on quantifier float
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940935064935">
There have been many attempts to describe the
situations under which the floating construction
is possible, almost all of which only consider
numeral-classifier constructions.
The earliest generative approaches suggested
that the target in the floating construction
must be either subject or object. Inoue (1983)
pointed out that quasi-objects, noun phrases
masked with the accusative case-marker but
failing other tests for objecthood, could also be
targets.
Miyagawa (1989) gives a comprehensive con-
figurational explanation, where the target and
quantifier must mutually c-command each other
(that is, neither the target nor the quantifier
dominates the other, and the first branching
node that dominates either one, dominates the
other). The restriction to nominative and
accusative targets is explained by proposing a
difference in structure. Verb arguments sub-
categorized for in the lexicon are noun phrases,
where the case-marker is a clitic and thus can be
c-commanded, whereas adjuncts are headed by
their markers, to form post-positional phrases
which are thus not available as targets.
The c-command relation is applied to both
the noun phrases themselves and traces. Quan-
tifiers can be scrambled (moved from their base
position after their target) leaving a trace if the
target is an affected Theme NP, and the target
and quantifier are governed by the verb that
assigns this thematic role. Thus quantifiers as-
sociated with affected themes can move within
the sentence. Affected themes are things that
are &amp;quot;changed, created, converted, extinguished,
consumed, destroyed or gotten-rid of&amp;quot;.
Miyagawa (1989, 57) proposes a syntactic test
for affectiveness: affected themes can occure in
the intransitive resultative construction -te-aru.
Alam (1997) looks at the problem from a dif-
ferent angle, and proposes that only quantifiers
which are interpreted &amp;quot;distributively or as a
quantified event&amp;quot; can float, as they take wide
scope beyond the NP. A quantified noun phrase
will also quantify the event if the noun phrase
measures-out the event, where &amp;quot;direct internal
arguments undergoing change in the event de-
scribed by the verb measure out the event&amp;quot;
a very similar description to that of affected
theme. However, Jackendoff (1996) has shown
that a wide variety of arguments can measure
out processes, not just subjects and objects, but
also the complements of prepositional phrases.
Which case-roles measure out the process can
be pragmatically determined as well as lexically
stipulated, so it is not a simple matter to deter-
mine which arguments are relevent.
The excellent distributional analysis of Down-
ing (1996) shows that actual cases of float-
ing tend to be absolutive, that is quantifiers
largely float from intransitive subjects (67%) or
direct objects of transitive verbs (24%) rather
than from transitive subjects (4%) or indirect
objects (1%).
On the question of why quantifiers appear
outside of the noun phrases they quantify, there
have been two explanations: Discourse new in-
formation floats to the pre-verb focus position
(Downing, 1996; Kim, 1995), quantifiers float
from noun phrases that &apos;measure out&apos; an event
(Alam, 1997).
We speculate that there may be a perfor-
mance based reason. Hawkins (1994) has shown
that many phenomena claimed to be discourse
related are in fact largely due to performance.
However we have not yet compiled sufficient em-
pirical evidence to show this conclusively.

3.2 Identify potential anchors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995402041666666">
All noun phrases that matched a case-slot
marked with -ga (nominative) or -o (accusative)
are accepted as potential anchors. This is the
traditional criterion given for potential anchors.
Note even if the surface marker is different, for
example when the case-marker is overwritten by
a focus-marker such as -wa &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot;, the &apos;canon-
ical&apos; case-marker will be found by our parser.
Noun phrases marked with -ni (dative), have
been shown to be permissible candidates, but
we do not allow them. Such sentences are, how-
ever, rare outside linguistics papers. We found
no such candidates in the sentences we exam-
ined, and Downing (1996, 239) found only one
in ninety six examples. When we tried allow-
ing dative noun phrases, it significantly reduced
the performance of our algorithm: every dative
noun phrase selected was wrong. If we could
determine which noun phrases measure-out the

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.924873">
3.3 Discard bad combinations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997730125">
Some combinations of anchor and quantifier can
be ruled out. We have identified three cases:
semantically anomalous cases; sentences where
the quantifier modifies the verb as a degree
modifier; and sentences where the quantifier
modifies the verb as a frequency modifier.
3.3.1 Semantically anomalous cases
Singular noun phrases In Japanese, pro-
nouns and names are typically marked with a
collectiviser (such as -tachi) if there are multi-
ple referents (see e.g. Martin (1988, 143-154)).
A pronoun or name not so marked characteris-
tically has a singular interpretation. For names
this can be overridden by a numeral-classifier
combination (8), although it is rare, but not by
an quantificational noun (9).

<bodyText confidence="0.970046266666667">

In all the texts we examined, we found no ex-
amples of names modified by floating numeral-
classifier combinations. We therefore block all
pronouns and names not modified by a collec-
tiviser from serving as anchors to floating quan-
tifiers.
In Japanese, there is not a clear division be-
tween pronouns and common nouns, particu-
larly kin-terms such as ojisan &amp;quot;grandfather/old
man&amp;quot;. Pronouns can be modified in the same
way as common nouns, and kin-terms are often
used to refer to non kin. Pronouns modified by
quantifiers need to be translated by more gen-
eral terms as in (10).

Classifier semantic restrictions For nu-
meral classifiers, the selectional restrictions of
the classifier can be used to disallow certain

<bodyText confidence="0.999520611111111">
combinations. For example, -kai &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; can
only be used to modify event-nouns such as
shokuji &amp;quot;meal&amp;quot; or jishin &amp;quot;earthquake&amp;quot;. How-
ever, the semantics are very complicated, and
there is a great deal of variation, as a classifier
can select not just for the object denoted by its
target but also a sub-part of it. In addition,
classifiers can be used to select meanings figu-
ratively, coercing a new interpretation of their
head. Bond and Paik (1997) suggest a way of
dealing with this in the generative lexical frame-
work of Pustejovsky (1995) but it requires more
information about the conceptual structure of
noun phrases than is currently available.
For the time being, we use a simple table
of forbidden combinations. For example point°
&amp;quot;point&amp;quot; will not be used to quantify nouns de-
noting agent, place or abstract noun.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.710716">
3.3.2 Degree modification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989061066666667">
Noun quantifiers can be used as degree modi-
fiers as well as quantifying some referent. If the
predicate is used to state a property of the po-
tential anchor, then a noun quantifier will char-
acteristically be a degree modifier.
We use the verbal semantic attributes given
in the Goi-Taikei (Ikehasa et al., 1997) to
test for this relationship. Anchoring will
be blocked either if the potential anchor is
nominative and the verbal semantic attribute
is one of attribute transfer, existence,
attribute or result or if the anchor is ac-
cusative and the verbal semantic attribute is
physical/attribute transfer.
Sentence (II) shows this constraint in action:

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.745671">
3.3.3 Event modification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994012142857143">
The final case we need to consider is where the
noun quantifier can quantify the event or the
affected theme of the event, such as (12). In
Japanese, either reading is possible when the
quantifier is in pre-verbal position. Anchor-
ing the quantifier is equivalent to choosing the
theme reading.

Examining our corpus showed the theme
reading to be the default. Of course, if the
event is modified elsewhere, for example by a
temporal modifier, then different readings are
possible. The system in which our implementa-
tion was tested lacks a system for event quan-
tification, so we were not able to implement
any constraint for this phenomenon. We there-
fore implemented the theme reading as our de-
fault. Note that, for stative verbs with per-
manent readings such as shiru &amp;quot;know&amp;quot;, there is
almost no difference between the two readings
(13).

If there are more than two combinations, the

Prefer accusative: A combination with an

to allow for the absolutive bias.

anchors.
Prefer closest: Subtract one for each inter-
vening quantifier: Closer targets are bet-
ter.

Finally select the highest scoring combination
and eliminate any combinations that include the
chosen quantifier and anchor. If there is still a

Once the best combinations are chosen, the
quantifier can be anchored to its target. We
consider the best way to represent this would
be by showing the semantic relation in a sepa-
rate level from the syntax, in a similar way to
the architecture outlined by Jackendoff (1997).
Our implementation is in a machine transla-
tion system and we simply rewrite the sentence
so that the floating quantifier becomes an pre-
nominal modifier of its target, marked with the
adnominal case-marker -no. The resulting mod-
ifier is labeled as &apos;anchored&apos;, to allow special
processing during the transfer phase.

4 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969888888889">
The algorithm was tested on a 3700 sentence
machine translation test set of Japanese sen-
tences with English translations, produced by
a professional human translator. A description
of the test set and its design is given in Ikehara
et al. (1994).
Overall, 56 possible combinations were found
and 37 anchored in 3700 sentences: Table 2.
Of these, 9 were anchored that should not
have been, and 1 was not anchored that
should have been. The accuracy (correctly an-
chored/anchored) was 76% (28/37), and the
recall (correctly anchored/should be anchored)
was 97% (28/29).
The major source of errors was from parsing
errors in the system as a whole. All of the badly
anchored numeral-classifiers combinations were
caused by this. In this case, the algorithm has
not degraded the system performance, it would
have been a bad result anyway.
There were three problems with the algorithm
itself. In one case an anaphoric quantifier was
mistaken as a floating quantifier, in another the
verbal semantic attribute check for degree mod-
ification gave a bad result. Finally there was
one case where the default blocking for seman-
tic anomalies blocked a good combination.

Translation of floating quantifiers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99921325">
Note that anchoring a floating quantifier is only
the first step toward translating it. Special han-
dling is sometimes needed to translate the an-
chored quantifiers.
For example, Japanese has some universal
pronouns that can stand alone as full noun
phrases (14) or act as floating quantifiers (15):
e.g., minna &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot;, zen&apos;in &amp;quot;all members&amp;quot;.
When they are anchored, the information about
the denotation of the head carried by the pro-
noun is redundant, and should not be trans-
lated. A special rule is required for this.

We have presented an algorithm to anchor float-
ing quantifiers in Japanese. The algorithm pro-
ceeds as follows. First identify potential float-
ing quantifiers: either numeral classifier combi-
nations or quantificational nouns. Then iden-
tify potential anchors: all accusative or nom-
inative noun phrases. Inappropriate combina-
tions are deleted, either because of a semantic

mismatch between the target and quantifier, or
because the quantifier is interpreted as a degree
or event modifier. Finally, possible combina-
tions are ranked, with the accusative candidate
being the best choice, then the closest and left-
most. The algorithm is robust and uses the full
power of currently available detailed semantic
dictionaries.

Zusammenfassung
In diesem Papier beschreiben wir einen Algo-
rithmus zur Resolution von &apos;floating quantifiers&apos;
im Japanischen. Japanisch ist eine Sprache,
in der quantifizierende Adverbien oder Kombi-
nationen aus Numeral + Klassifikator von der
Nominalphrase, fur die sie quantifizieren ge-
trennt werden kOnnen, d.h. sie miissen nicht
in unraittelbarer linearer Abfolge stehen.
Der Algorithmus unterscheidet Grad- und
Ereignismodifikatoren von Adverbialen, die fur
Nominalphrasen quantifizieren wad resolviert
den richtigen Antezedenten fiir jeden &apos;floating
quantifier&apos;. au. Anbindung an die richtige
Nominalphrase finden die folgenden Parameter
Beriicksichtigung: Wortart der Quantifikators
und des Antezedenten, die semantische Relation
zwischen diesen beiden, die Kasusmarkierungen
des Antezedenten und die Semantik des Verbs,
das sowohl den Quantifikator als auch dessen
Antezedenten regiert.
Der Algorithmus wurde implementiert und
in einem regel-basierten Japanisch/Englischem
tibersetzungssystera evaluiert.

<abstract confidence="0.999259222222222">In this paper we present an algorithm to anchor floating quantifiers in Japanese, a language in which quantificational nouns and numeralclassifier combinations can appear separated from the noun phrase they quantify. The algorithm differentiates degree and event modifiers from nouns that quantify noun phrases. It then finds a suitable anchor for such floating quantifiers. To do this, the algorithm considers the part of speech of the quantifier and the target, the semantic relation between them, the case marker of the antecedent and the meaning of the verb that governs the two constituents. The algorithm has been implemented and tested in a rule-based Japanese-to-English machine translation system, with an accuracy of 76% and a recall of 97%.</abstract>

Quantifiers can be scrambled (moved from their base position after their target) leaving a trace if the target is an affected Theme NP, and the target and quantifier are governed by the verb that assigns this thematic role. Thus quantifiers associated with affected themes can move within the sentence. Affected themes are things that are &amp;quot;changed, created, converted, extinguished, consumed, destroyed or gotten-rid of&amp;quot;. Miyagawa (1989, 57) proposes a syntactic test for affectiveness: affected themes can occure in the intransitive resultative construction -te-aru. Alam (1997) looks at the problem from a different angle, and proposes that only quantifiers which are interpreted &amp;quot;distributively or as a quantified event&amp;quot; can float, as they take wide scope beyond the NP. A quantified noun phrase will also quantify the event if the noun phrase measures-out the event, where &amp;quot;direct internal arguments undergoing change in the event described by the verb measure out the event&amp;quot; a very similar description to that of affected theme. However, Jackendoff (1996) has shown that a wide variety of arguments can measure out processes, not just subjects and objects, but also the comp</context>
<context position="10671" citStr="Alam, 1997" startWordPosition="1645" endWordPosition="1646">which arguments are relevent. The excellent distributional analysis of Downing (1996) shows that actual cases of floating tend to be absolutive, that is quantifiers largely float from intransitive subjects (67%) or direct objects of transitive verbs (24%) rather than from transitive subjects (4%) or indirect objects (1%). On the question of why quantifiers appear outside of the noun phrases they quantify, there have been two explanations: Discourse new information floats to the pre-verb focus position (Downing, 1996; Kim, 1995), quantifiers float from noun phrases that &apos;measure out&apos; an event (Alam, 1997). We speculate that there may be a performance based reason. Hawkins (1994) has shown that many phenomena claimed to be discourse related are in fact largely due to performance. However we have not yet compiled sufficient empirical evidence to show this conclusively. 3 An algorithm to identify and anchor floating quantifiers The proposed algorithm is outlined in Figure 1. In our implementation it is appplied to each of one or more candidate outputs of a Japanese dependency parser as part of the semantic ranking. 3.1 Identify potential floating quantifiers The first step is to identify potentia</context>

For example, -kai &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; can only be used to modify event-nouns such as shokuji &amp;quot;meal&amp;quot; or jishin &amp;quot;earthquake&amp;quot;. However, the semantics are very complicated, and there is a great deal of variation, as a classifier can select not just for the object denoted by its target but also a sub-part of it. In addition, classifiers can be used to select meanings figuratively, coercing a new interpretation of their head. Bond and Paik (1997) suggest a way of dealing with this in the generative lexical framework of Pustejovsky (1995) but it requires more information about the conceptual structure of noun phrases than is currently available. For the time being, we use a simple table of forbidden combinations.

Note that these nouns are often treated as adverbs, as they typically function as adjuncts that modify verbs, a function prototypically carried out by adverbs. They can however head noun phrases, and take some case-markers, so we classify them as nouns. Numeral classifiers form a closed class, although a large one. Japanese and Korean both have two or three hundred numeral classifiers (not counting units), although typically individual speakers use far less, between 30 and 80 (Downing, 1995, 346). Syntactically, numeral classifiers are a subclass of nouns. The main property distinguishing them from prototypical nouns is that they cannot stand alone. Typically they postfix to numerals, forming a quantifier phrase, although they can also combine with the quantificational prefix sti &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; or the interrogative nani &amp;quot;what&amp;quot;: (3) 2-hiki &amp;quot;2 animals&amp;quot; (Numeral) (4) sti-hiki &amp;quot;some animals&amp;quot; (Quantifier) (5) nan-biki &amp;quot;how many animals&amp;quot; (Interrogative) Semantically, classifiers both classify and quantify the referent of the noun phrase they collocate with.

This is a very different construal to the pre-nominal construction.

Two studies indicate that there are pragmatic differences (Downing, 1996; Kim, 1995). Pre-nominal constructions typically are used to introduce important referents, with nonexistential predicates, while floating constructions typically introduce new number information. In addition floating constructions are used 153 when the nominal has other modifiers, and are more common in spoken text. We will restrict the following discussion to the difference between the pre-nominal and floating uses. 2.1 Restrictions on quantifier float There have been many attempts to describe the situations under which the floating construction is possible, almost all of which only conside</context>

Which case-roles measure out the process can be pragmatically determined as well as lexically stipulated, so it is not a simple matter to determine which arguments are relevent. The excellent distributional analysis of Downing (1996) shows that actual cases of floating tend to be absolutive, that is quantifiers largely float from intransitive subjects (67%) or direct objects of transitive verbs (24%) rather than from transitive subjects (4%) or indirect objects (1%). On the question of why quantifiers appear outside of the noun phrases they quantify, there have been two explanations: Discourse new information floats to the pre-verb focus position (Downing, 1996; Kim, 1995), quantifiers float from noun phrases that &apos;measure out&apos; an event (Alam, 1997).

However, although there are several NLP systems that incorporate some solution to the problem of floating quantifiers, to the best of our knowledge, no algorithm for anchoring floating quantifiers has been given. We propose such an algorithm in this paper. The algorithm uses information about case-marking, sentence structure, part-of-speech, noun and verb meaning. The algorithm has been implemented and tested within the Japanese-to-English machine translation system ALT-J/E (Ikehara et al., 1991). The next section *describes the phenomenon of quantifier float in more detail. We then propose our algorithm to identify and anchor floating quantifiers in Section 3.

A description of the test set and its design is given in Ikehara et al. (1994). Overall, 56 possible combinations were found and 37 anchored in 3700 sentences: Table 2. Of these, 9 were anchored that should not have been, and 1 was not anchored that should have been. The accuracy (correctly anchored/anchored) was 76% (28/37), and the recall (correctly anchored/should be anchored) was 97% (28/29). The major source of errors was from parsing errors in the system as a whole. All of the badly anchored numeral-classifiers combinations were caused by this.

For example, -kai &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; can only be used to modify event-nouns such as shokuji &amp;quot;meal&amp;quot; or jishin &amp;quot;earthquake&amp;quot;. However, the semantics are very complicated, and there is a great deal of variation, as a classifier can select not just for the object denoted by its target but also a sub-part of it. In addition, classifiers can be used to select meanings figuratively, coercing a new interpretation of their head. Bond and Paik (1997) suggest a way of dealing with this in the generative lexical framework of Pustejovsky (1995) but it requires more information about the conceptual structure of noun phrases than is currently available. For the time being, we use a simple table of forbidden combinations. For example point° &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; will not be used to quantify nouns denoting agent, place or abstract noun. 3.3.2 Degree modification Noun quantifiers can be used as degree modifiers as well as quantifying some referent.
