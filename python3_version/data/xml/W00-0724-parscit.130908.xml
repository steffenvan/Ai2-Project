Weighted Probability Distribution Voting
(WPDV) is a newly designed machine learning
algorithm, for which research is currently
aimed at the determination of good weighting
schemes. This paper describes a simple yet
effective weight determination procedure, which
leads to models that can produce competitive
results for a number of NLP classification
tasks.

Weighted Probability Distribution Voting
(WPDV) is a supervised learning approach to
classification. A case which is to be classified is
represented as a feature-value pair set:
Fcase= Iffi = {f. = v.}}
An estimation of the probabilities of the various
classes for the case in question is then based on
the classes observed with similar feature-value
pair sets in the training data. To be exact, the
probability of class C for Fca„ is estimated as
a weighted sum over all possible subsets Fsub of

with the frequencies (freq) measured on the
training data, and N(C) a normalizing factor
such that &gt;P(C) = 1.
In principle, the weight factors WEsub can be
assigned per individual subset. For the time
being, however, they are assigned for groups of
subsets. First of all, it is possible to restrict
the subsets that are taken into account in the
model, using the size of the subset (e.g. Fsub
contains at most 4 elements) and/or its fre-
quency (e.g. Fsub occurs at least twice in the
training material). Subsets which do not fulfil
the chosen criteria are not used. For the sub-
sets that are used, weight factors are not as-
signed per individual subset either, but rather
per &amp;quot;family&amp;quot;, where a family consists of those
subsets which contain the same combination of
feature types (i.e. the same ft).
The two components of a WPDV model, dis-
tributions and weights, are determined sepa-
rately. In this paper, I will use the term training
set for the data on which the distributions are
based and tuning set for the data on the basis of
which the weights are selected. Whether these
two sets should be disjunct or can coincide is
one of the subjects under investigation.

2 Family weights
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978704611111111">
The various family weighting schemes can be
classified according to the type of use they make
of the tuning data. Here, I use a very rough
classification, into weighting scheme orders.
With Oth order weights, no information
whatsoever is used about the data in tuning
set. Examples of such rudimentary weighting
schemes are the use of a weight of k! for all sub-
sets containing k elements, as has been used e.g.
for wordclass tagger combination (van Halteren
et al., To appear), or even a uniform weight for
all subsets.
With 18t order weights, information is used
about the individual feature types, i.e.
WF. ub = H Wfi
{ilffi=vi/EF3.b}
First order weights ignore any possible inter-
action between two or more feature types, but

have the clear advantage of corresponding to a
reasonably low number of weights, viz, as many
as there are feature types.
With nth order weights, interaction pat-
terns are determined of up to n feature types
and the family weights are adjusted to compen-
sate for the interaction. When n is equal to
the total number of feature types, this corre-
sponds to weight determination per individual
family. nth order weighting generally requires
much larger numbers of weights, which can be
expected to lead to much slower tuning proce-
dures. In this paper, therefore, I focus on first
order weighting.

3 First order weight determination
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999878">
As argumented in an earlier paper (van Hal-
teren, 2000a), a theory-based feature weight de-
termination would have to take into account
each feature&apos;s decisiveness and reliability. How-
ever, clear definitions of these qualities, and
hence also means to measure them, are as yet
sorely lacking. As a result, a more pragmatic
approach will have to be taken. Reliability is ig-
nored altogether at the moment,1 and decisive-
ness replaced by an entropy-related measure.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991548">
3.1 Initial weights
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995831375">
The weight given to each feature type fi should
preferably increase with the amount of informa-
tion it contributes to the classification process.
A measure related to this is Information Gain,
which represents the difference between the en-
tropy of the choice with and without knowledge
of the presence of a feature (cf. Quinlan (1986)).
As do Daelemans et al. (2000), I opt for a fac-
tor proportional to the feature type&apos;s Gain Ra-
tio, a normalising derivative of the Information
Gain value. The weight factors Win are set to
an optimal multiplication constant C times the
measured Gain Ratio for L. C is determined by
calculating the accuracies for various values of
C on the tuning set2 and selecting the C which
yields the highest accuracy.
&apos;It may still be present, though, in the form of the
abovementioned frequency threshold for features.
2If the tuning set coincides with the training set, all
parts of the tuning procedure are done in leave-one-out
mode: in the WPDV implementation, it is possible to
(virtually) remove the information about each individual
instance from the model when that specific instance has
to be classified.

3.2 Hill-climbing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924433333333">
Since the initial weight determination is based
on pragmatic rather than theoretical consider-
ations, it is unlikely that the resulting weights
are already the optimal ones. For this reason,
an attempt is made to locate even better weight
vectors in the n-dimensional weight space. The
navigation mechanism used in this search is hill-
climbing. This means that systematic variations
of the currently best vector are investigated. If
the best variation is better than the currently
best vector, that variation is taken as the best
vector and the process is repeated. This repeti-
tion continues until no better vector is found.
In the experiments described here, the varia-
tion consists of multiplication or division of each
individual WI&apos;, by a variable V (i.e. 2n new vec-
tors are tested each time), which is increased if a
better vector is found, and otherwise decreased.
The process is halted as soon as V falls below
some pre-determined threshold.
Hill-climbing, as most other optimaliza-
tion techniques, is vulnerable to overtraining.
To lessen this vulnerability, the WPDV hill-
climbing implementation splits its tuning mate-
rial into several (normally five) parts. A switch
to a new weight vector is only taken if the ac-
curacy increases on the tuning set as a whole
and does not decrease on more than one part,
i.e. some losses are accepted but only if they
are localized.

is so large that the WPDV model has to be limited. For
the current experiments, I have opted for a maximum
size for Faub of four features and a threshold frequency
of two observations in the training set.

also used as tuning sets. This allows a compari-
son between tuning on the training set itself and
on a held-out tuning set. For comparison with
some other well-known machine learning algo-
rithms, I complement the WPDV experiments
with accuracy measurements for three other sys-
tems: 1) A system using a Naive Bayes prob-
ability estimation; 2) TiMBL, using memory
based learning and probability estimation based
on the nearest neighbours (Daelemans et al.,
2000),7 for which I use the parameters which
yielded the best results according to Daelemans
et al. (1999); and 3) Maccent, a maximum en-
tropy based system,5 for which I use both the
default parameters, viz, a frequency threshold
of 2 for features to be used and 150 iterations
of improved iterative scaling, and a more am-
bitious parameter setting, viz, a threshold of 1
and 300 iterations.

comparison systems.1° Oth order weights gener-
ally do not reach this level of accuracy.
Hill-climbing with the tuning set equal to the
training set produces the best results overall.
It always leads to an improvement over initial
weights of the accuracies on both test sets, al-
though sometimes very small (GS). Equally im-
portant, the improvement on the test sets is
comparable to that on the tuning/training set.
This is certainly not the case for hill-climbing
with the tuning set equal to the other test set,
which generally does not reach the same level of
accuracy and may even be detrimental (climb-
ing on PP3).
Strangely enough, hill-climbing with the tun-
ing set equal to the test set itself sometimes does
not even yield the best quality for that test set
(POS with test set i and especially NP with j).
This shows that the weight-&gt;accuracy function
does have local maxima, and the increased risk
for smaller data sets to run into a sub-optimal
one is high enough that it happens in at least
two of the eight test set climbs.

training sets instead of nine. The extreme differences for
the GS task show how much this task depends on indi-
vidual observations rather than on generalizations, which
probably also explains why Naive Bayes and Maximum
Extropy (Maccent) handle this task so badly.

In summary, hill-climbing should preferably
be done with the tuning set equal to the training
set. This is not surprising, as the leave-one-
out mechanism allows the training set to behave
as held-out data, while containing eight times
more cases than a test set turned tuning set.
The disadvantage is a much more time-intensive
hill-climbing procedure, but when developing an
actual production model, the weights only have
to be determined once and the results appear to
be worth it most of the time.

For the exact details, I refer the reader to Daelemans et al. (1999). a overall WPDV approach to wordclass tagging, see van Halteren (2000b). 120 Table 1: Accuracies for the POS task (with the Table 2: Accuracies for the GS task (with the set in leave-one-out mode) training set in leave-one-out mode) Weighting scheme Test set ah i j</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.996409970588236">order weights generally do not reach this level of accuracy. Hill-climbing with the tuning set equal to the training set produces the best results overall. It always leads to an improvement over initial weights of the accuracies on both test sets, although sometimes very small (GS). Equally important, the improvement on the test sets is comparable to that on the tuning/training set. This is certainly not the case for hill-climbing with the tuning set equal to the other test set, which generally does not reach the same level of accuracy and may even be detrimental (climbon Strangely enough, hill-climbing with the tuning set equal to the test set itself sometimes does not even yield the best quality for that test set with test set i and especially NP with This shows that the weight-&gt;accuracy function does have local maxima, and the increased risk for smaller data sets to run into a sub-optimal one is high enough that it happens in at least two of the eight test set climbs. accuracies for TiMBL are lower than those found by Daelemans et al. (1999): POS i 97.95, POS, GS i 93.75, GS, 93.58, PP t83.64, Ppi 82.51, 98.38 and NP i 98.25. This is due to the use of eight part training sets instead of nine. The extreme differences for the GS task show how much this task depends on individual observations rather than on generalizations, which probably also explains why Naive Bayes and Maximum Extropy (Maccent) handle this task so badly.

<abstract confidence="0.809860133333333">In summary, hill-climbing should preferably be done with the tuning set equal to the training set. This is not surprising, as the leave-oneout mechanism allows the training set to behave as held-out data, while containing eight times more cases than a test set turned tuning set. The disadvantage is a much more time-intensive hill-climbing procedure, but when developing an actual production model, the weights only have to be determined once and the results appear to be worth it most of the time.

As a result, a more pragmatic approach will have to be taken. Reliability is ignored altogether at the moment,1 and decisiveness replaced by an entropy-related measure. 3.1 Initial weights The weight given to each feature type fi should preferably increase with the amount of information it contributes to the classification process. A measure related to this is Information Gain, which represents the difference between the entropy of the choice with and without knowledge of the presence of a feature (cf. Quinlan (1986)). As do Daelemans et al. (2000), I opt for a factor proportional to the feature type&apos;s Gain Ratio, a normalising derivative of the Information Gain value. The weight factors Win are set to an optimal multiplication constant C times the measured Gain Ratio for L. C is determined by calculating the accuracies for various values of C on the tuning set2 and selecting the C which yields the highest accuracy. &apos;It may still be present, though, in the form of the abovementioned frequency threshold for features. 2If the tuning set coincides with the training set, all parts of the tuning procedure are </context>
