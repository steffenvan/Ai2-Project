In this paper we examine some issues pertaining to the task
of selection in text planning. We attempt to distinguish
salience and relevance, and characterize their role as
important fundamental notions governing selection. We also

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999837533333334">
Most models of natural language generation, be they
computational or psychological, recognize that the task of
text planning (also called conceptualization [14], [10]),
comprises the following essential subtasks: (1) content
selection and (2) content organization. The task of content
selection (hereafter, selection) is concerned with
computing, or retrieving from a knowledge base, the
primary content of texts. Selection may also include a
phase of content expansion, also called additional topic
inclusion [8]. Content expansion consists in inferentially
generating or selecting additional material for expression in
text, once the primary material is selected. The task of
content organization, also called topic organization [8],
content ordering or linearization [13], [14] deals with
ordering the chosen content into a sequence of
propositional (linear) representations, appropriate for
realization into coherent text.
Many text planning models concentrate chiefly on
content organization and perhaps content expansion. Such
planners accept as input a pre-selected, and to some extent,
pre-sequenced collection of representations that serve as
the raw material of text content. The knowledge base from
which these input elements are selected, as well as the
selection process itself, are treated to be external to the text
planner. In such systems, whatever selection is performed
by the text planner is confined to the task of choosing a
subset of the input elements according to control exercised
by knowledge sources resident within the text planner.
Other examples of systems in which pre-selected content is
input to the text planner include natural language
generation front-ends to expert systems, database systems
or other application programs- in other words, a problem-
solver or a host system which is devoted to domain-level
non-linguistic activities.
In some other models, such as those of Paris [23], the
knowledge base from which much of the text content is
drawn is resident within the text generation system itself.
Selection in such systems is totally a responsibility of the
text planner. In the TAILOR system of [23], for instance,
facts describing objects are stored in a knowledge base, and
the textual component selects the content of the description
from the knowledge base under the regulatory influence of
a user model. The urge to generate text is input to the
generator in the form of a request for the definition of an
object.
In all cases, the beholder of the natural language output
sees the text as coming from a single program which can
perform domain-level tasks as well as text production tasks:
the speaker and the thinker are one and the same. If the
beholder were a text planning researcher, she could be
inclined to pose questions about the origin of text content.
Our recent research has been motivated and directed by the
adoption of such a role. The problem of selection in texts
(in our case, multisentential descriptive texts) led us to
examine the nature of input to the text planner, and the
boundary between the domain-level program and the text
planner. When we regarded the thinker and the speaker as a
unified whole, we were led to search for very general
factors that influenced selection in diverse domains of
discourse production. When we viewed domain-level
activities and text planning activities as distinct tasks, we
examined the division of duties between the text planner
and its underlying program in the task of selection, and
explored the conditions under which the modular boundary
between the domain-level and the text-planning level could
be kept intact and those under which it might break down.
This paper is devoted to a presentation of our research on
some issues pertinent to selection in text planning. We
found that the fundamental notions that were crucial to
understanding selection in text planning were salience and
relevance. These are not altogether unfamiliar notions.
Conklin and McDonald [2] and Waltz [33] describe some
effects of salience in generating scene descriptions.
Researchers in natural language understanding have
studied salience and relevance in some detail and have used

them profitably in their accounts. However, in the natural
language generation research community, the terms are
used in their literal sense, and often interchangeably,
whereas in fact they are distinct notions. In this paper we
present the notions of salience and relevance as they pertain
to natural language generation, in particular, to (content)
selection.
Our presentation in section 2 is a synthesis of several
analyses of salience and relevance in the disciplines of
language understanding, psycholinguistics and
communication. In section 3 we consider the coupling
between domain-level tasks and text planning tasks from
the point of view of selection. Our work in the domain of
route description generation is presented in section 4. In
this domain, interesting questions emerge regarding mode
of knowledge representation, connections between text
planning and domain-level problem solving, and selection.
In the concluding section we briefly state our current work
and research plans for the near future.

2. Salience and Relevance
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999493272727273">
Salience and relevance are theoretical notions which are
influential in accounting for how or why certain objects,
concepts, properties or actions are highlighted or preferred
in natural language processing. Of particular interest to the
subject of this paper is the role of these important notions
in controlling selection (and omission) in text planning.
What is common to salience and relevance is their role as
determinants of decisions in selection. However, salience is
connected with speaker-external objects or properties,
while relevance is related to speaker-internal factors such
as goals and motivation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986995">
2.1 Salience
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999118484375">
Salience explains the prioritization or foregrounding of
objects or information. Such prioritization may arise from
direct perception of the world or context, or from
conceptual knowledge, built up by shared perceptual
experiences of the speaker and the hearer. According to
Sridhar [30] and Levelt [14], salience guides the direction
of the speaker&apos;s attention by making certain aspects of a
situation stand out relative to others. By virtue of being
ascribed to factors of context, situation or background,
salience is a relatively fixed notion, invariant with respect
to specific perceivers. Salience information can therefore
be lexicalized, stored as an invariant component of the
knowledge base, incorporated as a structural property of the
design of the knowledge base, and/or built into the control
processes that select text content from the knowledge base.
Perceptual salience arises from the prominence of
external characteristics such as size (bigness), amplitude of
sound (loudness), colour (brightness), etc. Osgood and
Bock [22] call this factor vividness. Conceptual salience
originates in (shared) experiential knowledge. For
example, the slyness of foxes, the strength of gorillas, and
other such distinguishing characteristics are conceptually
salient [4]. The head of a queue of people is a conceptually
salient part of the queue with respect to its function [7].
Conceptual salience also arises from the degree of
unexpectedness, unusualness or deviation from the norm of
an object or event, giving the object or event of description
its information value and thus motivating its selection in
the planned text. Salience is attributed to properties of
objects as well as to components of complex objects.
An important implication of salience for objects that
possess it is the ease of their availability in the knowledge
base or knowledge structure [34]. The higher the level of
salience of an object, the higher is its level of activation in
the speaker&apos;s mind, and therefore, the greater is its
probability of being selected in the speaker&apos;s description,
and the earlier is it likely to be mentioned in the
description. This fact has been recognized by Conklin and
McDonald [2], Osgood [21], Sridhar [30] and Levelt [14].
Salience and Text Planning. The significance of visual
salience in text planning has been pointed out by Conklin
and McDonald [2] in their empirical study involving scene
descriptions (of suburban houses) and the GENARO
program that generates similar descriptions. In GENARO,
the chosen representation for the set of objects is a list,
ordered according to decreasing levels of salience of the
objects. Non-salient objects are not represented. This list
mediates between the deep generation component and the
domain data base in regulating the order of description of
objects.
Other Work on Salience. Sridhar [30] amplifies upon
earlier psycholinguistic treatments of the role of salience in
single sentence production. He examines the effects of
salience on intrasentential syntactic ordering in phenomena
like passivization, topicalization and constituent order shift.
His results are of significance to the realization component
of natural language generation. On the subject of content
selection in the description of states and events, Sridhar
hypothesizes that actions are more salient than state
changes, which in turn are more salient than constant states.
Ortony [20] invokes salience in explaining the
interpretation of metaphor. Herskovits [7] uses salience in
her account of prepositional semantics and the construction
of mental models from prepositional phrases.

2.2 Relevance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.950444714285714">
Relevance constrains participants&apos; utterances and
interpretations in communicative contexts. It connects texts
and their generators through goals: speakers are assumed
to generate utterances which they believe to be relevant to
their goals [1]. It connects the context of text generation
with the generator and the text by the fact that
communication as well as the goals themselves are situated
in context, and by the assumption that the conversational
(or communicative) goals are relevant to the generator&apos;s
personal goals. The speaker&apos;s communicative goals are
characterized by the speaker wanting the goals to be made
known to the hearer, and intending to reach them by the
hearer knowing and adopting them [25]. Relevance is thus
an important notion that connects texts, contexts, speakers
and hearers. Selecting relevant information in a text
planning scenario is thus an issue of selecting information
that is pertinent to the generator&apos;s communicative goals.
Leech [12] defines relevance as follows:
An utterance is relevant to a speech situation if it can be
interpreted as contributing to the conversational goals of
the speaker or hearer.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.5719555">
Haslett [6] modifies this definition to account for the
communicative actions and knowledge. Her defmition of
relevance is stated as follows:
An utterance, action or unit of knowledge is relevant to a
</footnote>

<bodyText confidence="0.997206903846154">
speech situation #* it can be interpreted as contributing to
the communicative goals of the speaker or listener.
Relevance and Coherence. Haslett [6] emphasizes
relevance over coherence as the essential property of texts
emerging in communicative contexts. While coherence is
essential in interpreting texts, it is not sufficient in
accounting for how texts are planned and generated. Texts
make sense not only in the general way of being
interpretable, but also m the particular way of contributing
to conversational goals. Generators try to make their texts
both relevant and coherent. A relevant text must also be
coherent in the sense of being meaningful to the
conversational goals. However, not all coherent texts need
be relevant (cf. retorts like yes, but that&apos;s not relevant to the
issue). In their work on generating expert system
explanations, Moore and Swartout [19] implicitly affirm
the precedence of relevance over coherence. Although the
finer details of how they generate explanations are not
directly relevant to the concerns of this paper, their stress
on the role of the generator&apos;s goals in accounting for
selected text content is of significance. A similar view is
evident in Paris [24].
Relevance and Selection. Haslett&apos;s definition is suited
to our purposes, since it explicitly recognizes the role of the
knowledge sources (representations) as well as the
processes involved in selecting text content. Knowledge
could be represented in any number of ways. However the
definition of Haslett has implications for the design of
particular text planners and specific models of text
planning: a very natural design (for the knowledge base
that stores much of what is eventually expressed in text, as
well as for the processes that select from the knowledge
base) will be one which aids, and is in harmony with, the
goal structures present in the given setting or domain of
text generation. Mann and Moore [15], in their work on the
KDS system of text generation, point out the importance of
relevance in judging whether an item of knowledge should
be selected for expression in text. Their method, however,
has numerous deficiencies, a discussion of which is
presented in [15]. Paris [24] also recognizes explicitly the
relation between selection and relevance through goals.
Other Work on Relevance. Sperber and Wilson
[29] stress the role of relevance in language
comprehension. Their work is partly a response to the
shortcomings of the semiotic code model of verbal
communication. They emphasize the place of intended
inference in verbal communication, over and above the
encoding and decoding of messages. The reader is referred
to [6] for a critique of the theory of Sperber and Wilson
from the point of view of relevance. van Dijk and Kintsch
[32] and Schank [28] treat the more local, restricted issue
of topical relevance in sentences.

23 Relevance and Salience Contrasted
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820608695652">
Salience is a speaker-external, contextual principle, while
relevance is a speaker-internal principle related to the
speaker&apos;s goals. Waltz [33] states that in generating scene
descriptions, what the speaker notices is a function of
external factors (scene characteristics) and internal factors
(like goals). Thus he effectively recognizes the distinction
between salience and relevance, though he doesn&apos;t use the
term relevance to describe the external factors. Similarly,
psycholinguists like Sridhar [30] use the term salience to
describe relevance as presented here. Notions derived from
salience and relevance includefocus and attention.
Not all settings of text production may admit
characterization of salience, but all settings involve
relevance, to the extent that text production in the given
setting is purposive. However, relevance can be a nebulous
matter in many text production settings. Relevance and
salience could sometimes reinforce each other and at other
times, conflict with each other. When they do conflict,
relevance, given Haslen&apos;s definition, would have greater
weight in its dictates on selection decisions in particular
and language generation decisions in general. This
observation is in accord with Sridhar&apos;s psycholinguistic
fmdings on single sentence production.

3. Domain-Level Tasks and
Text Planning Tasks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970611111111">
We have noted relevance and salience as fundamental
notions that guide selection of text content. The effects of
relevance and salience can be brought out in text planning
systems in several ways, of which one is sketched below.
We assume that the primary content of texts is drawn from
a knowledge base, which may consist of several component
modules in the implementation.
A large body of surely-irrelevant knowledge is not
represented. This corresponds to a closed world assumption
for knowledge bases with respect to relevance and salience.
The knowledge base only contains potentially relevant and
salient items for all likely instances of text production.
Selection is still responsible for choosing only the portion
of the knowledge base that is pertinent to a particular
instance of text planning. The principles of relevance and
salience, as may be embodied in a text planner, are thus a
matter of representation as well as control. The control
could be exercised by a variety of knowledge modules,
such as the user model (as in the case of Paris [23]), the
hearer model (in effect, the user model) (as in the case of
Dale [3]), etc. What needs to be said is selected; at the
same time, what should be omitted is skipped, by the search
process turning a blind eye to irrelevant knowledge, as it
were. Selection processes mediate between the controlling
knowledge sources and the knowledge base from which
content is selected.
The texts produced by such systems may be perceived to
be emerging from communicative goals, though
communicative goals themselves are not explicitly
represented. In the text planning models of [3] and [23],
communicative goals need not be explicitly represented,
since relevance information is implicit in the semantics and
the content of the user model. When do the goals
themselves require explicit representation and reasoning in
the selection process? This question directs our analysis
towards two aspects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990757">
1. the nature of the text produced

domain-level tasks and text planning tasks

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990629">
3.1 Explanation Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999785">
The text could be self-referential, in that (for instance) the

content of text that it produced or the actions that were

performed at the non-linguistic, domain-level. (The identity
of mem-language with object-language is a quintessential
characteristic of natural languages). An exemplary case in
point is that of explanation generation in expert systems.
Explanation systems explicitly represent goals so as to
explain their domain-level actions, or to explain their own
pnor utterances, for instance in answering follow-up
questions in dialogues with the user, as in the works of
Moore and Paris [18], Paris [24] and Moore and Swartout
[19]. The explanation system of McKeown [16] identifies
its goals with the user&apos;s goals, which are hence represented
in detail.

3.2 Coupling between Domain-Level Tasks
and &apos;Text Planning Tasks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976403508772">
We observed in the introduction that the speaker and the
thinker are one and the same, in that a single system is
perceived to perform domain-level activities such as
problem-solving, action planning, etc, as well as text
production tasks. In this context, we could speak of loose
coupling and tight coupling between domain-level and text
planning tasks. Loose coupling implies modularization
between the two tasks in process models and
implementations. On the one hand we could ask whether
the domain-level tasks are in some sense naturally coupled
to text planning tasks, and on the other, we could ask what
the chosen theoretical paradigm, modelling method,
implementation or application has to do with the coupling.
Assuredly, the knowledge of relevance and salience that
is necessary in selecting text content is conceptually
distributed between the non-linguistic, domain-level and
the text production level. Therefore, the knowledge and the
processes involved in selecting are, in principle, distributed
at both levels. In actual implementations or computational
process models, if the coupling between domain-level tasks
and text planning tasks is loose, then additional work will
have to be done to make the coupling appear tight (i.e., to
make the thinker identical with the speaker). This issue
arises in the construction of explanation facilities for expert
systems and front-end natural language generators for
various application programs. Virtual tight coupling is
achieved by building interfaces, or by augmenting the
design of the expert system and/or the text planner.
In the Explainable Expert System architecture described
in Paris [24], this is achieved by designing expert systems
with explanation in mind, and by using for explanations the
support knowledge applied in deriving the expert system.
Problem-solving knowledge is kept insulated in the
implementation from the knowledge necessary for
generating explanations. Selection in the explanation task is
decided by the text planner and mediated by the use of a
rich text plan language, described in Moore and Paris [18].
The design of powerful plan languages (for selecting text
content from the knowledge base) is an interesting research
problem [9].
In the EPICURE recipe-generation system of Dale [3],
tight coupling is achieved by modelling discourse plans to
be isomorphic to domain-level plans. There is no domain-
level activity proceeding independently of (separately
from) text planning. In the work of Appelt [1], tight
coupling is ensured in the theoretical paradigm of action
planning in which both domain-level tasks and utterance
production (linguistic) tasks are uniformly viewed as
goal-directed actions. Content selection in Appelt&apos;s
system is distributed in a complex way throughout the
generation process by commitment to the view that the task
of what to say is inseparable from the task of how to say.
What about complex domains of language generation in
which domain-level activities are naturally coupled to text
planning activities, irrespective of the theoretical paradigm
that may be used? In the next section we turn our attention
to one such domain, viz., that of route communication.

4. Generating Route Descriptions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911181818182">
In this section we describe the domain of route description
generation, and report some aspects of our research on
generating descriptions of bus route directions from a given
source to an intended destination within a city. Our work
includes an implementation in CProlog of a prototype
system that generates descriptions of bus route directions in
Vancouver. A representation of the city or region in which
route description generation occurs is available in the form
of a cognitive map. The map serves as the knowledge base
in the domain-level activity of finding a route, as well as in
providing the primary content of route description texts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980923">
4.1 Route Communication
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999635947368421">
The verbal protocol that consists of requesting route
directions and giving them is termed route communication
by Klein [11]. Klein uses route communications that
occurred naturally on the streets of Frankfurt in exploring
the relation between the cognitive (domain-level) task of
route finding and the linguistic task of generating a route
description as manifested in the choice of local deictic
terms like here, there, left and right. Wunderlich and
Reinelt [35] deal with the discourse structure of route
communication. Although full route communication occurs
as a dialogue, the roles of the participants are not
symmetric as they would be, say, in a casual conversation.
All varieties of route communication involve selecting
from maps. However, the nature of information selected,
and in particular the kind of spatial information included in
the route description depend on such factors as the mode of
transportation used, whether the questioner herself will be
navigating or whether she will be using a public transport
system, etc.
Bus Route Descriptions. In our research on generating
bus route directions we emulated the methods of Klein
[11] and Wunderlich and Reinelt [35] to gather and
analyze natural text. Our primary linguistic data consist of
over 40 bus route descriptions to various destinations in
Vancouver, and include written (printed) as well as spoken
descriptions. We concentrate on the route description phase
of the dialogue, which emerges more or less as monological
text. Route descriptions involve knowledge of different
granularities. For instance, when the full journey involves
taking two or more buses, the connecting buses may be
available at the point of disembarkation (from the previous
bus) itself, or just across the street. But often, one may have
to walk a fair distance before transferring to the next bus. In
such cases, the bus route description also includes walk-
route information, as illustrated by the italicized portion of
the following text:
from Kingsway and Edmonds you want to catch bus
number 106 called Metrotown ... take it down to the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997087">

Burrard station ... and at Burrard station you want to
walk north on Burrard one block ... as far as West
Pender ... and on West Pender going westbound it&apos;s bus
number 19 and it&apos;s called Stanley Park
Route Descriptions vs Route Sketches. Route
descriptions are also interesting in that they can also be
communicated non-verbally (graphically) in the form of a
route sketch. The following spoken text describes how to
get from Lougheed Mall to Grouse Mountain in
Vancouver. The &amp;quot;...&amp;quot;s correspond to pauses or confirmatory
expressions like ok or yeah by the questioner.
from Lougheed Mall? ok, you could catch a 151 or a
152 called Vancouver ... get off at Hastings and
Kootenay right by the Kootenay Loop ... on Hastings in
front of the loop transfer to bus number 28 called Phibbs
Exchange ... will cross Second Narrows Bridge to Phibbs
Exchange on the other side ... and that&apos;s where you
could catch the 232 Grouse Mountain bus ... and it goes
right up to Grouse Mountain.
The information conveyed by this text could also be
expressed graphically as illustrated in figure 1. There are
interesting parallels between natural language route
descriptions and route sketches as bearers of information. A
one-to-one correspondence may be seen between certain
aspects of route sketches and natural language route
descriptions. However, route descriptions are linear, and
the use of certain mechanisms such as connectives,
pronominals and deictic terms is exclusively associated
with the use of natural language as the medium of
description.

4.2 Planning and Discourse Units in
Route Description Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961347826087">
A journey consists of a series of connected route sections.
However, not all route sections need be described in a route
description. For instance, when a public transportation
system is used, all the details of the turns taken by the
conveyance used are not relevant for the description.
However, when one has to drive or walk, information on
each route section and turn should be communicated.
Thus, route planning units at the domain level are in
general more detailed than route description units at the
discourse level.
Route descriptions consist of a sequence of units, each
specifying, at the very least, a source, a destination and a
route label. In the case of bus route descriptions, such a unit
consists of a specification of a boarding point, a
disembarkation point and the bus label for a single bus ride.
Such units provide the skeletal plans for route description
texts. In figure 1, the skeletal plans correspond to the
connected sequence of arrows marked with the bus labels.
The skeletal plans are computed by the route fmder using
the knowledge base (map), and are input to the text planner.
The text planner may augment the skeletal plans by
selecting from the knowledge base additional descriptions
of landmarks, location, orientation and so on.

4.3 Knowledge Base and Route Finder
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999173682926829">
We have described the design of the knowledge base and
the route finder in [26]. For discussions of issues on the
form, content, function and structure of spatial knowledge
in the domain of route description generation, the reader is
referred to Habel [5], and to experimental works such as
those of McNamara [17] and Thorndyke [31].
As noted earlier, the cognitive (problem-solving) task of
route fmding and the linguistic task of description
generation are simultaneously manifested in route
communication. We do not make specific cognitive claims
regarding how the route finding and description generation
tasks are interleaved. In instances of human route
communication, one may become aware of the final
sections of the route even before the initial sections are
realized into descriptions. However, a route section will
have to be determined before it is realized. Accordingly,
we separate route fmding and route description generation,
and feed the text planner with the sequence of skeletal
plans (described in section 4.2) furnished by the route
fmder.
The route fmder is specialized for the description
generation task, in the sense that its output units correspond
to the discourse units (skeletal plans) of the descriptions.
The sequence of skeletal plans processed by the text
planner preserves the spatiotemporal connectivity of the
journey described. The route finder thus contributes to the
discourse structure, coherence and gross linearization of the
route description. Therefore the text planner need not
maintain any explicit paragraph-level representation for the
overall text in its discourse model.
The input to the route finder is a top-level goal
represented in Prolog as in
?- rfind(pats_house,sfu).
It outputs the following skeletal plans in sequence. We
use the Prolog list notation to indicate that the three
elements of the skeletal plan have no positional
significance in the representation.
1.[source(pats_house),dest(lougheed_mall),
rlabel(busid(1m134))]
2.[source(lougheed_mall),dest(sfu),

4.4 Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997495">
Input to the text planner is a sequence of skeletal plans
generated by the route finder. The planner consists of two
major submodules that correspond to two ordered stages of
processing: (1) selector and (2) realization-specification (r-
spec) synthesizer. The details of the r-spec synthesizer and
other aspects of the route description generation system
will be presented in [27]. The selector augments the
skeletal plan with additional information retrieved (or
computed) from the knowledge base (map), possibly under
the control of various knowledge sources. The output of
the selector is an expanded plan. The expanded plan is
input to the r-spec synthesizer, which accommodates the
information in the plan into one or more r-specs. It attends
to such tasks as forming predicates, choosing the utterance
type and certain language-oriented tasks like topicalization,
choice of verb modality and tense. The r-specs are input to
the realization module which generates surface sentences.
The text planner thus deals with two distinct sorts of
representations, one of which is closer to the domain
(knowledge-base) and one, to the language.

What kind of extra information is selected? The
following are some of the kinds of information selected at
this stage.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97113119047619">
• Direction or orientation, as in the
descriptions On West Pender going
westbound it&apos;s bus number 19. Walk north
on Renfrew.
• Distance information, for realizing such
descriptions as You walk north on Burrard
one block as far as West Pender.
• Landmarks and location descriptions for
sources and destinations of route sections, as
included in the descriptions Get off at
Hastings and Kootenay right by the
Kootenay Loop. On Hastings in front of the
loop transfer to bus number 28 called Phibbs
Exchange.
• Additional descriptions of route sections
involving landmarks, as in Will cross Second
Narrows Bridge to Phibbs Exchange on the
other side.
• Straightforward matters like retrieving names
corresponding to route labels in the skeletal
plan (bus number, bus name, etc).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952468085106">
How is the information derived? Computation of
direction (orientation) information requires availability of a
co-ordinate system and additional inference modules. The
text planner (selector) uses additional procedural domain
knowledge for retrieving or computing orientation
information. Information so computed is expressed
linguistically as north, left, right, and so on, and
incorporated into the text plan. The search and
computation of orientation from a map using qualitative or
quantitative information forms a separate subject matter of
study by itself.
Distance is expressed in route descriptions in terms of
various units, as, for example, in one block, 200 yards or
three stoplights, but may not be represented in the map in
the same terms. In our system we simplify the task of
distance estimation/evaluation by directly representing
distances in terms requited by the text planner.
Retrieving landmarks for describing locations of sources
and destinations requires examining finer-grainer spatial
layout information at the neighbourhood of these points.
Salience plays a key role in the choice of landmarks chosen
for location description. Along with the task of choosing
the landmark comes the task of computing the locative
relation between the two objects (for example, adjacence),
and expressing the relation in language (as in right by).
Salience also influences the choice of landmarks chosen
for describing long route sections (as in will cross Second
Narrows Bridge...). In our implementation we have
represented certain landmarks along the bus mute stages.
Given the end-points of a route section, the landmarks
along the way can be selected for description. It is to be
noted that landmarks like the Second Narrows Bridge
aren&apos;t quite points, but are idealized as points and
represented in the knowledge base as such. Our
implementation at present doesn&apos;t include the detailed
representations and procedures necessary for deriving
orientation, distance and location information. We sidestep
the task by incorporating such information in the form
requited by the text planner.
What is the rationale for selecting such information?
The kinds of information described in this section are
common in route descriptions, but are nevertheless
secondary to the essential information contained in the
skeletal plans. When a route section should be covered by a
walk or a drive, some kind of distance information is
required. Location information is crucial at transfer points
(intermediate destinations). Additional descriptions of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99591">
84
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992789375">
routes in terms of landmarks crossed give the prospective
traveller a feel for how long she needs to be on the bus,
train, etc, and assure her that she is still on the right track.
Orientation information is given in bus route descriptions
when the listener has to take a bus after a spell of walk
(self-navigation), as evident in the description
...you want to walk north on Burrard one block as far as
West Pender... and on West Pender going westbound it&apos;s
bus number 19...
But one cannot always attribute motives for including
additional material in route descriptions. At present we
include in the text plan all additional relevant material that
can be extracted from the knowledge base.
How is the selected information incorporated in the
plan? Additional information selected at this stage is
incorporated in a skeletal plan like
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6754995">
[source(lougheed_mall),dest(hastings@ kootenay),
rlabel(busid(van151))]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999255809523809">
by adding to the list or by argument-adjunction and
replacement. For example, the skeletal plan given above
may be expanded as:
[source(lougheed_mall),dest(d(hastings@kootenay),
loc(next(kootenay_loop))),
rlabel(busid(busnumber(151),busname(vancouver))),
via(brentwood_mall)]
Discussion. We have used the skeletal plan as a substrate
on which further information is deposited by the selector in
the text planner. At the same time, the information
available in the skeletal plan enables fast access to the
information needed by the selector, by providing the route-
label, source and destination names. This corresponds to
our intuition regarding route description generation using
visual search over maps: once we spot the end-points of a
route section, we can easily spot the additional relevant
objects around the end-points and over the route-section
connecting them. The selector derives the information
from the same knowledge base (map) consulted by the
route fmder.
The text plan thus has a dual function: (1) for selection
from the knowledge base, in its skeletal form and (2) for
conversion into text eventually, in its expanded form. The
expanded plan also has a third important function: a copy
of the expanded plan is retained in the discourse record for
consultation when the corresponding r-spec and sentences,
and the next expanded plan are generated. It thus provides a
record of the objects that have been introduced in the
discourse, and forms the basis for decisions on
pronominalization, referential expression generation and
other factors that govern text coherence.
It is to be noted that the domain of route description
generation involves the use of a knowledge base which is
primarily object-oriented. The knowledge base consists of
points, landmarks, bus routes, streets and so on. The route
finder works with the knowledge base and gives some
objects the status of source, destination and route-label in
particular instances of route finding. The selector in the text
planner picks up some more objects, endowing them with
such attributes as landmarks, distance, direction. As the
expanded plan stands now, it can just as well be expressed
pictorially as a route-sketch.

We have examined the roles of salience and relevance as
determinants of selection decisions, and presented their
distinction mostly in intuitive terms. The notions should be
formulated in more precise terms to be usable in specific
models or implementations. We are continuing our
investigation on salience and relevance by attempting to
cast them in concrete terms in the domain we are currently
examining, viz., route description generation. As in the
case of Grice&apos;s maxims and many other pragmatic
principles, the formulation of formal principles appears to
be a difficult task. Herskovits [7] has encountered similar
difficulties in attempting to formalize salience and
relevance rigorously (in her case, for the purpose of
preposition understanding).
We are also continuing our research on the coupling
between the thinker and the speaker. Examining the kinds
and degrees of coupling will help us understand the nature
of text planning tasks, design better text planners and
compare various models of natural language generation.
Our system is intended to generate bus route descriptions.
However, there are other route descriptions that are more
demanding in the kind of knowledge representation and
processing that they require, and more complex in their
syntax. The representations for text plans and r-specs we
use are also limited in variety and are tailored to the
domain under examination. We are at present completing
the implementation of the system.
Route description generation is in itself a very complex
process, and this research can proceed along several lines
of further work: introduction of various knowledge sources
to regulate selection from the knowledge base,
representation of more detailed spatial knowledge at
several levels, and so on. Upon completion of the current
implementation effort, our primary plans, however, are to
examine the implications of the system as a process model
for speech-like monological multisentential text generation,
refine its details and examine its applicability to other
domains.

It connects texts and their generators through goals: speakers are assumed to generate utterances which they believe to be relevant to their goals [1]. It connects the context of text generation with the generator and the text by the fact that communication as well as the goals themselves are situated in context, and by the assumption that the conversational (or communicative) goals are relevant to the generator&apos;s personal goals. The speaker&apos;s communicative goals are characterized by the speaker wanting the goals to be made known to the hearer, and intending to reach them by the hearer knowing and adopting them [25].

This paper is devoted to a presentation of our research on some issues pertinent to selection in text planning. We found that the fundamental notions that were crucial to understanding selection in text planning were salience and relevance. These are not altogether unfamiliar notions. Conklin and McDonald [2] and Waltz [33] describe some effects of salience in generating scene descriptions. Researchers in natural language understanding have studied salience and relevance in some detail and have used 79 them profitably in their accounts. However, in the natural language generation research community, the terms are used in their literal sense, and often interchangeably, whereas in fact they are distinct notions.

Salience is attributed to properties of objects as well as to components of complex objects. An important implication of salience for objects that possess it is the ease of their availability in the knowledge base or knowledge structure [34]. The higher the level of salience of an object, the higher is its level of activation in the speaker&apos;s mind, and therefore, the greater is its probability of being selected in the speaker&apos;s description, and the earlier is it likely to be mentioned in the description. This fact has been recognized by Conklin and McDonald [2], Osgood [21], Sridhar [30] and Levelt [14]. Salience and Text Planning. The significance of visual salience in text planning has been pointed out by Conklin and McDonald [2] in their empirical study involving scene descriptions (of suburban houses) and the GENARO program that generates similar descriptions.

The knowledge base only contains potentially relevant and salient items for all likely instances of text production. Selection is still responsible for choosing only the portion of the knowledge base that is pertinent to a particular instance of text planning. The principles of relevance and salience, as may be embodied in a text planner, are thus a matter of representation as well as control. The control could be exercised by a variety of knowledge modules, such as the user model (as in the case of Paris [23]), the hearer model (in effect, the user model) (as in the case of Dale [3]), etc. What needs to be said is selected; at the same time, what should be omitted is skipped, by the search process turning a blind eye to irrelevant knowledge, as it were. Selection processes mediate between the controlling knowledge sources and the knowledge base from which content is selected.

Perceptual salience arises from the prominence of external characteristics such as size (bigness), amplitude of sound (loudness), colour (brightness), etc. Osgood and Bock [22] call this factor vividness. Conceptual salience originates in (shared) experiential knowledge. For example, the slyness of foxes, the strength of gorillas, and other such distinguishing characteristics are conceptually salient [4]. The head of a queue of people is a conceptually salient part of the queue with respect to its function [7]. Conceptual salience also arises from the degree of unexpectedness, unusualness or deviation from the norm of an object or event, giving the object or event of description its information value and thus motivating its selection in the planned text. Salience is attributed to properties of objects as well as to components of complex objects.

Relevance is thus an important notion that connects texts, contexts, speakers and hearers. Selecting relevant information in a text planning scenario is thus an issue of selecting information that is pertinent to the generator&apos;s communicative goals. Leech [12] defines relevance as follows: An utterance is relevant to a speech situation if it can be interpreted as contributing to the conversational goals of the speaker or hearer. Haslett [6] modifies this definition to account for the communicative actions and knowledge. Her defmition of relevance is stated as follows: An utterance, action or unit of knowledge is relevant to a 80 speech situation #* it can be interpreted as contributing to the communicative goals of the speaker or listener.

Their method, however, has numerous deficiencies, a discussion of which is presented in [15]. Paris [24] also recognizes explicitly the relation between selection and relevance through goals. Other Work on Relevance. Sperber and Wilson [29] stress the role of relevance in language comprehension. Their work is partly a response to the shortcomings of the semiotic code model of verbal communication. They emphasize the place of intended inference in verbal communication, over and above the encoding and decoding of messages. The reader is referred to [6] for a critique of the theory of Sperber and Wilson from the point of view of relevance. van Dijk and Kintsch [32] and Schank [28] treat the more local, restricted issue of topical relevance in sentences. 23 Relevance and Salience Contrasted Salience is a speaker-external, contextual principle, while relevance is a speaker-internal principle related to the speaker&apos;s goals. Waltz [33] states that in generating scene descriptions, what the speaker notices is a function of external factors (scene characteristics) and internal factors (like goals).

Perceptual salience arises from the prominence of external characteristics such as size (bigness), amplitude of sound (loudness), colour (brightness), etc. Osgood and Bock [22] call this factor vividness. Conceptual salience originates in (shared) experiential knowledge. For example, the slyness of foxes, the strength of gorillas, and other such distinguishing characteristics are conceptually salient [4]. The head of a queue of people is a conceptually salient part of the queue with respect to its function [7]. Conceptual salience also arises from the degree of unexpectedness, unusualness or deviation from the norm of an object or event, giving the object or event of description its information value and thus motivating its selection in the planned text. Salience is attributed to properties of objects as well as to components of complex objects. An important implication of salience for objects that possess it is the ease of their availability in the knowledge base or knowledge structure [34]. The higher the level of salience of an object, the higher is its level of activation in the speaker&apos;s mind,</context>

He examines the effects of salience on intrasentential syntactic ordering in phenomena like passivization, topicalization and constituent order shift. His results are of significance to the realization component of natural language generation. On the subject of content selection in the description of states and events, Sridhar hypothesizes that actions are more salient than state changes, which in turn are more salient than constant states. Ortony [20] invokes salience in explaining the interpretation of metaphor. Herskovits [7] uses salience in her account of prepositional semantics and the construction of mental models from prepositional phrases. 2.2 Relevance Relevance constrains participants&apos; utterances and interpretations in communicative contexts. It connects texts and their generators through goals: speakers are assumed to generate utterances which they believe to be relevant to their goals [1]. It connects the context of text generation with the generator and the text by the fact that communication as well as the goals themselves are situated in context, and by the assumption that the conversational (or commu</context>

The notions should be formulated in more precise terms to be usable in specific models or implementations. We are continuing our investigation on salience and relevance by attempting to cast them in concrete terms in the domain we are currently examining, viz., route description generation. As in the case of Grice&apos;s maxims and many other pragmatic principles, the formulation of formal principles appears to be a difficult task. Herskovits [7] has encountered similar difficulties in attempting to formalize salience and relevance rigorously (in her case, for the purpose of preposition understanding). We are also continuing our research on the coupling between the thinker and the speaker. Examining the kinds and degrees of coupling will help us understand the nature of text planning tasks, design better text planners and compare various models of natural language generation.

Our work includes an implementation in CProlog of a prototype system that generates descriptions of bus route directions in Vancouver. A representation of the city or region in which route description generation occurs is available in the form of a cognitive map. The map serves as the knowledge base in the domain-level activity of finding a route, as well as in providing the primary content of route description texts. 4.1 Route Communication The verbal protocol that consists of requesting route directions and giving them is termed route communication by Klein [11]. Klein uses route communications that occurred naturally on the streets of Frankfurt in exploring the relation between the cognitive (domain-level) task of route finding and the linguistic task of generating a route description as manifested in the choice of local deictic terms like here, there, left and right. Wunderlich and Reinelt [35] deal with the discourse structure of route communication.

What is common to salience and relevance is their role as determinants of decisions in selection. However, salience is connected with speaker-external objects or properties, while relevance is related to speaker-internal factors such as goals and motivation. 2.1 Salience Salience explains the prioritization or foregrounding of objects or information. Such prioritization may arise from direct perception of the world or context, or from conceptual knowledge, built up by shared perceptual experiences of the speaker and the hearer. According to Sridhar [30] and Levelt [14], salience guides the direction of the speaker&apos;s attention by making certain aspects of a situation stand out relative to others. By virtue of being ascribed to factors of context, situation or background, salience is a relatively fixed notion, invariant with respect to specific perceivers. Salience information can therefore be lexicalized, stored as an invariant component of the knowledge base, incorporated as a structural property of the design of the knowledge base, and/or built into the control processes that select text content from the knowledge base. Perceptual salience arises from the </context>

An important implication of salience for objects that possess it is the ease of their availability in the knowledge base or knowledge structure [34]. The higher the level of salience of an object, the higher is its level of activation in the speaker&apos;s mind, and therefore, the greater is its probability of being selected in the speaker&apos;s description, and the earlier is it likely to be mentioned in the description. This fact has been recognized by Conklin and McDonald [2], Osgood [21], Sridhar [30] and Levelt [14]. Salience and Text Planning. The significance of visual salience in text planning has been pointed out by Conklin and McDonald [2] in their empirical study involving scene descriptions (of suburban houses) and the GENARO program that generates similar descriptions. In GENARO, the chosen representation for the set of objects is a list, ordered according to decreasing levels of salience of the objects. Non-salient objects are not represented. This list mediates between the deep generation component and the domain data base in regulating the order of description of objects. Other Work on Salienc</context>

Knowledge could be represented in any number of ways. However the definition of Haslett has implications for the design of particular text planners and specific models of text planning: a very natural design (for the knowledge base that stores much of what is eventually expressed in text, as well as for the processes that select from the knowledge base) will be one which aids, and is in harmony with, the goal structures present in the given setting or domain of text generation.

Salience information can therefore be lexicalized, stored as an invariant component of the knowledge base, incorporated as a structural property of the design of the knowledge base, and/or built into the control processes that select text content from the knowledge base. Perceptual salience arises from the prominence of external characteristics such as size (bigness), amplitude of sound (loudness), colour (brightness), etc. Osgood and Bock [22] call this factor vividness. Conceptual salience originates in (shared) experiential knowledge. For example, the slyness of foxes, the strength of gorillas, and other such distinguishing characteristics are conceptually salient [4]. The head of a queue of people is a conceptually salient part of the queue with respect to its function [7]. Conceptual salience also arises from the degree of unexpectedness, unusualness or deviation from the norm of an object or event, giving the object or event of description its information value and thus motivating its selection in the planned text.

In such systems, whatever selection is performed by the text planner is confined to the task of choosing a subset of the input elements according to control exercised by knowledge sources resident within the text planner. Other examples of systems in which pre-selected content is input to the text planner include natural language generation front-ends to expert systems, database systems or other application programs- in other words, a problemsolver or a host system which is devoted to domain-level non-linguistic activities. In some other models, such as those of Paris [23], the knowledge base from which much of the text content is drawn is resident within the text generation system itself. Selection in such systems is totally a responsibility of the text planner. In the TAILOR system of [23], for instance, facts describing objects are stored in a knowledge base, and the textual component selects the content of the description from the knowledge base under the regulatory influence of a user model. The urge to generate text is input to the generator in the form of a request for the definition of an object. In all cases, the beholder of the natural language output</context>

The knowledge base only contains potentially relevant and salient items for all likely instances of text production. Selection is still responsible for choosing only the portion of the knowledge base that is pertinent to a particular instance of text planning. The principles of relevance and salience, as may be embodied in a text planner, are thus a matter of representation as well as control. The control could be exercised by a variety of knowledge modules, such as the user model (as in the case of Paris [23]), the hearer model (in effect, the user model) (as in the case of Dale [3]), etc. What needs to be said is selected; at the same time, what should be omitted is skipped, by the search process turning a blind eye to irrelevant knowledge, as it were. Selection processes mediate between the controlling knowledge sources and the knowledge base from which content is selected. The texts produced by such systems may be perceived to be emerging from communicative goals, though communicative goals themselves are not explicitly represented.

However, not all coherent texts need be relevant (cf. retorts like yes, but that&apos;s not relevant to the issue). In their work on generating expert system explanations, Moore and Swartout [19] implicitly affirm the precedence of relevance over coherence. Although the finer details of how they generate explanations are not directly relevant to the concerns of this paper, their stress on the role of the generator&apos;s goals in accounting for selected text content is of significance. A similar view is evident in Paris [24]. Relevance and Selection. Haslett&apos;s definition is suited to our purposes, since it explicitly recognizes the role of the knowledge sources (representations) as well as the processes involved in selecting text content. Knowledge could be represented in any number of ways. However the definition of Haslett has implications for the design of particular text planners and specific models of text planning: a very natural design (for the knowledge base that stores much of what is eventually expressed in text, as well as for the processes that select from the knowledge base) will be one which aids, a</context>

(The identity of mem-language with object-language is a quintessential characteristic of natural languages). An exemplary case in point is that of explanation generation in expert systems. Explanation systems explicitly represent goals so as to explain their domain-level actions, or to explain their own pnor utterances, for instance in answering follow-up questions in dialogues with the user, as in the works of Moore and Paris [18], Paris [24] and Moore and Swartout [19]. The explanation system of McKeown [16] identifies its goals with the user&apos;s goals, which are hence represented in detail. 3.2 Coupling between Domain-Level Tasks and &apos;Text Planning Tasks We observed in the introduction that the speaker and the thinker are one and the same, in that a single system is perceived to perform domain-level activities such as problem-solving, action planning, etc, as well as text production tasks. In this context, we could speak of loose coupling and tight coupling between domain-level and text planning tasks. Loose coupling implies modul</context>

This issue arises in the construction of explanation facilities for expert systems and front-end natural language generators for various application programs. Virtual tight coupling is achieved by building interfaces, or by augmenting the design of the expert system and/or the text planner. In the Explainable Expert System architecture described in Paris [24], this is achieved by designing expert systems with explanation in mind, and by using for explanations the support knowledge applied in deriving the expert system. Problem-solving knowledge is kept insulated in the implementation from the knowledge necessary for generating explanations. Selection in the explanation task is decided by the text planner and mediated by the use of a rich text plan language, described in Moore and Paris [18]. The design of powerful plan languages (for selecting text content from the knowledge base) is an interesting research problem [9]. In the EPICURE recipe-gener</context>

It connects the context of text generation with the generator and the text by the fact that communication as well as the goals themselves are situated in context, and by the assumption that the conversational (or communicative) goals are relevant to the generator&apos;s personal goals. The speaker&apos;s communicative goals are characterized by the speaker wanting the goals to be made known to the hearer, and intending to reach them by the hearer knowing and adopting them [25]. Relevance is thus an important notion that connects texts, contexts, speakers and hearers. Selecting relevant information in a text planning scenario is thus an issue of selecting information that is pertinent to the generator&apos;s communicative goals. Leech [12] defines relevance as follows: An utterance is relevant to a speech situation if it can be interpreted as contributing to the conversational goals of the speaker or hearer. Haslett [6] modifies this definition to account for the communicative actions and knowledge. Her defmition of relevance is stated as follows: An utterance, action or</context>

The planner consists of two major submodules that correspond to two ordered stages of processing: (1) selector and (2) realization-specification (rspec) synthesizer. The details of the r-spec synthesizer and other aspects of the route description generation system will be presented in [27]. The selector augments the skeletal plan with additional information retrieved (or computed) from the knowledge base (map), possibly under the control of various knowledge sources. The output of the selector is an expanded plan. The expanded plan is input to the r-spec synthesizer, which accommodates the information in the plan into one or more r-specs.

What is common to salience and relevance is their role as determinants of decisions in selection. However, salience is connected with speaker-external objects or properties, while relevance is related to speaker-internal factors such as goals and motivation. 2.1 Salience Salience explains the prioritization or foregrounding of objects or information. Such prioritization may arise from direct perception of the world or context, or from conceptual knowledge, built up by shared perceptual experiences of the speaker and the hearer. According to Sridhar [30] and Levelt [14], salience guides the direction of the speaker&apos;s attention by making certain aspects of a situation stand out relative to others. By virtue of being ascribed to factors of context, situation or background, salience is a relatively fixed notion, invariant with respect to specific perceivers.

This fact has been recognized by Conklin and McDonald [2], Osgood [21], Sridhar [30] and Levelt [14]. Salience and Text Planning. The significance of visual salience in text planning has been pointed out by Conklin and McDonald [2] in their empirical study involving scene descriptions (of suburban houses) and the GENARO program t</context>

Klein uses route communications that occurred naturally on the streets of Frankfurt in exploring the relation between the cognitive (domain-level) task of route finding and the linguistic task of generating a route description as manifested in the choice of local deictic terms like here, there, left and right. Wunderlich and Reinelt [35] deal with the discourse structure of route communication. Although full route communication occurs as a dialogue, the roles of the participants are not symmetric as they would be, say, in a casual conversation. All varieties of route communication involve selecting from maps. However, the nature of information selected, and in particular the kind of spatial information included in the route description depend on such factors as the mode of transportation used, whether the questioner herself will be navigating or whether she will be using a public transport system, etc. Bus Route Descriptions.</context>
