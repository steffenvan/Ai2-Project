Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999911923076923">
Both anaphora resolution and preposi-
tional phrase (PP) attachment are the
most frequent ambiguities in natural lan-
guage processing. Several methods have
been proposed to deal with each phe-
nomenon separately, however none of
proposed systems has considered the way
of dealing both phenomena We tackle
this issue here, proposing an algorithm
to co-ordinate the treatment of these two
problems efficiently, i.e., the aim is also
to exploit at each step all the results that
each component can provide.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999589607142857">
Several methods have been proposed to deal
with anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase
(PP) attachment phenomenon and separately, so
that the literature is very abundant : for PPs see
e.g., (Frazier and Fodor, 1979; Hobbs, 1990), and
(Wilks and Huang, 1985), and for anaphora see
e.g., (Carter, 1986; Reinhart, 1983) and (Sidner,
1983). However none of these methods has con-
sidered the way of dealing both phenomena in the
same concrete system.
We propose in this paper an algorithm that
deals with both phenomena, in the same anal-
yser. The anaphora module pertains to the recent
methods, uses a set of resolution rules based on
the focusing approach, see (Sidner, 1983). These
rules are applied to the conceptual representation
and their output is a set of candidate antecedents.
Concerning the PPs, unattached prepositions in-
volve empty or unfilled roles in the Conceptual
Structures (CSs), expressed in a frame-based lan-
guage (Zarri, 1992). The disambiguation proce-
dure aims at filling the empty roles using attach-
ment rules.
This work was accomplished in the context of
COBALT project (LRE 61-01), dealing with fi-
nancial news. A detailed discussion about both
procedures of anaphora resolution and PP attach-
ment is largely developed in (Azzam, 1994).

2 The algorithm
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.948182">
Two of the main principles of the algorithm are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.716949">
a) The algorithm is applied on the text sentence
by sentence, i.e. the ambiguities of the previous
sentences have already been considered (resolved
or not).
b) The anaphora procedure skips the resolution
of a given anaphor when this anaphor is preceded
by an unattached preposition. This is because the
resolution rules may have an empty role as a pa-
rameter, due to this unattached preposition. The
resolution of the anaphor is then postponed to the
second phase of anaphora resolution.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998802125">
The proposed procedure is based on successive
calls to the anaphora module and to the PP at-
tachment module. The output of each call is
a set of CSs that represent the intermediate re-
sults exchanged between each call and on which
both modules operate in turn. The aim is to fill
the unfilled roles in the CSs, due to anaphora or
unattached PPs. To summarize the algorithm is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996376875">
1) Apply the anaphora module first.
2) Apply the PP attachment procedure.
3) If some anaphora.are left unresolved, apply
the anaphora module again.
4) If there are still unattached PPs, apply the
attachment procedure again.
5) Repeat (3) and (4), until all PPs and
anaphors are treated.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.774125">
The order in which the two modules are called is
based on efficiency deduced from statistical data
performed on COBALT corpuses.
Three main cases are faced by the algorithm :
a) When the anaphor occurs before a given prepo-
sition in the sentence, its resolution does not de-
pend on where the preposition is to be attached
(except for cataphors that are quite rare). In this
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.993003888888889">
case the anaphora module can be applied before
the attachment procedure.
The example 1 below shows that the resolution
of the anaphoric pronoun that must be performed
first and that the PP starting with of be attached
later.
(1) The sale of Credito was first proposed last
August and that of BCI late last year.
b) When the anaphor occurs after one or sev-
eral unattached prepositions, it could be an intra-
sentential anaphor (i.e. referring to an entity in
the same sentence), then its resolution may de-
pend on one of the previous prepositional phrases.
In this case, the resolution of the anaphora is post-
poned to a next call of the anaphora module ac-
cording to principle b) stated above.
c) When the anaphor is included in a PP (particu-
lar case of b), PP attachment rules need semantic
information about the &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; of the PP; when it
is a pronoun, no semantic information is available,
so that the attachment rules can not be applied.
The anaphoric pronouns have to be resolved first,
so as to determine what semantic class they re-
fer to ; the PP attachment procedure can then
be applied. When a sequence contains more than
two such PPs, i.e., with anaphors as objects, the
length of a cycle is more than 4.

3 An example
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995935409090909">
(2) UPHB shares have been suspended since Oc-
tober 29 at the firm&apos;s request following a surge in
its share price on a takeover rumour.
- The pronoun its can not be resolved by the
anaphora resolution module because it is preceded
by unattached PPs ; its resolution is skipped.
- The PP attachment procedure is then called to
determine the attachment of since and at while
the object of the in PP comprises an anaphoric
pronoun its (case c).
- The anaphora module is called again to resolve
the anaphoric pronoun its, which is possible, in
this example, since the previous PPs have been
attached and there is no anaphors before.
- Finally, the PP attachment procedure has to be
called again for the in PP.
Notice that even if each module is called sev-
eral times, there is no redundancy in the process-
ing. The algorithm should be considered as the
splitting of both anaphora resolution and PP at-
tachment procedures into several phases and not
as the repetition of each procedure.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999754375">
The objective was to emphasise more than it has
been done until now, the fact that PP attach-
ment and anaphora resolution could interact in
the same system in order to produce a complete
conceptual analysis, instead of slowing down each
other. The algorithm we proposed in this, paper,
is independent of the used approaches in both
anaphora and attachment modules. It concerns
rather the way of managing the interaction be-
tween the two modules.
Our actual work addresses more the problems
inside each module. The attachment module has
been implemented at 99%. Presently we are work-
ing on the extension of the anaphora module par-
ticularly to deal also with the anaphoric definite
noun phrases.
