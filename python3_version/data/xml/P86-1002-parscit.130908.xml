OVERVIEW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999764">
This is the story of how one of the new
natural language processing products
reached the marketplace. On the surface,
it is the story of one NL researcher-
turned-entrepreneur (yours truly) and of
one product, Q&amp;A. But this is not just my
story: It is in microcosm the story of NL
emerging from the confines of the academic
world, which in turn is an instance of the
old theme &amp;quot;science goes commercial.&amp;quot;

BACKGROUND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.882665769230769">
In September of 1985, Symantec introduced
its first commercial product, Q&amp;A. Q&amp;A is
a $299 integrated business-productivity
tool for the IBM PC/XT/AT and compatibles.
It includes
a file management system,
a report generator,
a word processor,
a spelling checker and
an &amp;quot;intelligent assistant&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;IA.&amp;quot;
The IA lets users manipulate databases and
produce reports by issuing commands or
asking questions in English.

WHY O&amp;A IS IMPORTANT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999797108108108">
Q&amp;A is important to everyone with an
interest in natural language processing
because it is bringing NL technology to
the attention of the world at large.
Already Q&amp;A is the most widely used NL
system ever developed, with hundreds of
people now using it on a daily basis and
thousands using it occasionally. Here is
a small sampling of the reaction:
* SoftSel, the largest US distributor of
microcomputer software, publishes a
biweekly &amp;quot;hot list&amp;quot; ranking its
best-selling products. At the time of
this writing, Q&amp;A is number 3 on the
list, below only dBASE III and Lotus
123, with monthly sales in the
thousands. Some weeks Q&amp;A has actually
been above Lotus on the charts.
* Every major publication addressing the
IBM PC market in the U.S., Europe and
Australia has written about Q&amp;A, and
their reviews have consistently been
favorable. Infoworld gave Q&amp;A a 5 disk
rating--its highest. PC Week has
called Q&amp;A the &amp;quot;quintessential
management tool.&amp;quot; In the New York
Times, Q&amp;A received an unprecedented
2-pert review, and it took honors as
the &amp;quot;software product of the year&amp;quot; in
Australia.
* In a comprehensive survey of file
management systems for IBM PCs,
Software Digest, which is widely
considered to provide the microcomputer
industry&apos;s most objective testing, gave
Q&amp;A the highest overall evaluation ever
given to any product in any category.

WHAT&apos;S THE STORY BEHIND Q&amp;A
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989632">
Compressing all detail, Q&amp;A is a direct
outgrowth of NL research conducted at SRI
International in the 1970&apos;s.
About the time SRI&apos;s LADDER project was
winding down, the Apple Computer appeared
on the scene and I got the crazy idea that
it would be neat to build a LADDER for the
Apple. The known problems were that there
wasn&apos;t an INTERLISP for the Apple,
LADDER&apos;s code was over 100 times larger
than the Apple&apos;s 48K memory, the Apple was
too slow, and LADDER couldn&apos;t be ported to
new databases relevant to personal use.
These turned out to be the easy problems.
Getting Q&amp;A off the ground eventually
entailed starting two companies, coming
close to going broke on multiple
occasions, putting a number of personal
friends through months or years of stress,
building a new culture for AI/micro/
marketing cross fertilization, and
learning about lawyers, finance, product
marketing, PC DOS, C, advertising, PR,
promotions, sales, and end users. But in
the end, the product happened.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9249885">
Thousands of people now own or use NL
systems, and hundreds of thousands have
read about them. The world of NL has
changed, and new opportunities for
research and commercialization abound.
