In this superbly written essay, Francois Rastier, a distinguished French linguist with
several books on interpretative semantics, questions the foundations of linguistics and
cognitive science in order to investigate the role of semantics with respect to the other
disciplines of this &apos;new&apos; interdisciplinary science of cognition. The book is organized
into three sections: the first, of 100 pages, considers the history and epistemology of
cognitive science; the second, of particular relevance to computational linguists, studies
in 60 pages the relationship between semantics and Al; and the last, of 70 pages,
investigates the interactions between semantics on the one hand, and psychology and
neurosciences on the other hand.
Before developing these different studies, Rastier clearly states his positions in a
10-page introduction. In his opinion, &amp;quot;linguistics is a descriptive, partially predictive
science [and] empirical rationalism&apos; is the philosophical approach best suited to the
theoretical activity of the linguist&amp;quot;&apos; (p. 12) for it can account for the multiplicity of de-
terminations proper to linguistic objects such as texts. Only the dogmatic rationalist,
guilty of unwarranted theoretical reductionism, searches for methodological universals
&amp;quot;that he invents and reifies, admiring himself for their discovery&amp;quot; (p. 12). For Rastier,
diversity, not unity, is taken to be the fundamental problem of linguistics. In partic-
ular, context, both linguistic and nonlinguistic, is taken to be an integral unpredictable
component of comprehension, accounting for the multiplicity of interpretations. One
may reduce context to a Montague-like index, but recognizing the existence of contex-
tual variables says little about their instantiation. Consequently, for Rastier, &amp;quot;linguistic
performance consists in adapting oneself to a situation whose parameters escape the
computational paradigm&amp;quot; (p. 13). Linguistics is viewed as a subdiscipline of semiotics,
a social science, concerned with actual tongues,&apos; concrete linguistic communication,
and culturesâ€”three factors systematically downplayed, if not ignored, by cognitive
science.
This introduction sets the tone for the rest of the book and presents its two re-
curring themes: a systematic attack on universalism (its leaders and its philosophical
underpinnings) and a strong argument in favor of the existence and autonomy of a
semiotic level, which includes semantics, the world of the Saussurian signifie, distinct
from the conceptual level.
Section 1 starts with an investigation into the nature, history, and assumptions of
cognitive science. According to Rastier, only the functionalist postulate, which assumes

that humans and machines are able to understand in similar ways, gives unity to cog-
nitive science. But the interdisciplinary nature of the field does not grant it the status of
a science, and thus Rastier quickly disposes of the expression cognitive science in favor
of the more prudent cognitive researches.&apos; This is not merely a point of terminology. In
effect, Rastier dismisses the existence of a science of cognition, unduly created by the
functionalist credo that has come to dominate epistemology with the emergence of the
computer. Furthermore, AT is taken to be not a science but a technology whose object
of study belongs first to philosophy: the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive studies
does not avoid their purely technical functionalist views. For example, the reduction
of rationality to formality, the conflation of meaning and representation, and the be-
lief that an algorithm can validate a theory, all proceed from functionalism. Orthodox
cognitivism, as best exemplified by the &apos;MIT school,&apos; especially Chornsky and Fodor,
rests on these three misconceptions. Most of the essay is spent attacking this particular
position. Regarding connectionism, as well as Winograd&apos;s recent argumentation for a
&apos;new design,&apos; which both attempt to appropriate phenomenology and Heidegger to
themselves, Rastier only briefly deplores the misuse of Heideggerian phenomenology,
which is profoundly antitechnological, to improve a technology, namely AT.
Having dismissed cognitive science per se, Rastier argues that only comparative
linguistics can account for the diversity of tongues and dialects, and thus partici-
pate in cognitive researches. Formal approaches to human communication require a
universal grammar, unduly distinct from a lexicon, which standardizes tongues into
&apos;natural language,&apos; ignoring in the process all cultural facets of human communication.
Thus, linguistics is erroneously specialized into a computationalist science of language:
formalists restrict the object of study of linguistics but yet, paradoxically, require the-
oretical universals proper to dogmatic rationalism (whose universalism Rastier relates
to American imperialism and ethnocentrism!). What is in question is the nature of
linguistics per se. Rastier pleads convincingly for a humanist approach to linguistics;
one, in particular, that does not rely on the Chomskyan distinction between semantics
(concerned with the problem of reference) and pragmatics (concerned with the prob-
lem of inference). For this separation not only logicizes semantics but, more impor-
tantly, incorrectly conflates meaning and representation. This leads Rastier to discard
all cognitive theories of meaning (denotational semantics including possible worlds
and procedural semantics, primitivism a la Schank or Wilks, propositionalism, etc.). In
fact, Rastier rejects the traditional instrumental view of language based on the idealis-
tic Aristotelean triad of meaning, which &amp;quot;bans semantics from linguistics and makes it
dependent on an ontology, which is the only thing able to link words to reality through
the mediation of concepts&amp;quot; (p. 90). Instead, in order to rehabilitate linguistics as a social
science and separate semantics from psychology, Rastier considers signifies of tongues
and mental representations to be distinct, mutually conditioning cultural formations.
A nondeterministic relativism is adopted, as defined by the following: &amp;quot;The semantic
structures of a text constrain the psychic representations that accompany its utterance
and its interpretation, without however determining its meaning in the strong sense of
the term&amp;quot; (p. 97). Sapir and Whorf as anthropologists are credited with giving culture
its due importance in linguistics, despite their seeming linguistic determinism.
Up to this point of the discussion, Rastier&apos;s arguments are mostly philosophical.
But for the rest of the section, the linguist proper takes over and argues at a technical

level for a differential semantics, based on the principle of dissimilation, which supports
nondeterministic relativism. In essence, the Saussurian concept of value is taken to
define the true reality of linguistic units in that the value of a signifie is determined
by its position with respect to the tongue taken as a system: &amp;quot;The linguistic meaning
is not (or not only) constituted by the reference to things, or by the inference between
concepts, but also and firstly by the difference between linguistic units... The signifie of
a lexie is defined as a value; the differences [between semes] that constitute this value
determine its operational contents, that is, the set of its possibilities for assembling
in texts... The operational contents constrain the eidetic contents, without however
determining it in the strong sense&amp;quot; (pp. 101-103). The task of the linguist then con-
sists in determining semantic classes, through the study of lexical commutations and
co-occurrences, and social norms. Traditional objections to Saussurian semantics are
shown to rest on the rejected Aristotelean triad. Moreover, Rastier refers to another of
his books to claim that differential semantics has the advantage of being unified, that
is, of also addressing inference and reference. In the end, the subsuming thesis is that
every semantic occurrence is unique and that any semantic type is but a conceptual
reconstruction: &amp;quot;not only are there no two synonymous words, but there are no two
identical occurrences of the same word&amp;quot; (p. 114). Examples with synonyms, tautolo-
gies, and parataxic sequences, all extensively studied by the author in previous work,
illustrate the discussion.
In the second section of the book, Rastier investigates the relationship between
semantics and Al, though this may seem pointless after having rejected its dominant
theories of meaning. First, semantic networks are considered. Rastier agrees with Wilks
in trying &amp;quot;to assimilate the structures of knowledge to textual structures, rather than
the opposite, for the representation of language is the difficult task, and the represen-
tation of knowledge per se is meaningless outside of this&amp;quot; (p. 130). Rastier remarks
that the knowledge value of a network is not dependent on it. Instead, the knowledge
value of a text (and thus of the network that could model it) is defined not in terms
of its truth but of the relation between the text&apos;s cohesion and coherence. The point
of the complicated argumentation is two-fold: (a) concepts cannot be modeled inde-
pendently from language, and (b) semantics is not reducible to any sort of logic. For
Rastier, the relationship between reference and inference constitutes the fundamental
problem of formal semantics. AT has not reconciled these two complementary views of
semantics (though Sowa is praised for addressing this precise problem). Instead, with
the emergence of cognitive science, AT has merely moved away from formal semantics
toward cognitive semantics in which meaning becomes plausible inferences, that is,
to a psychological ontology, ultimately opening the door to connectionist networks
and their statistical decisions. Second, Rastier dissects Al formalisms with respect to
the fundamental problem of relevance. After reviewing existing approaches, Rastier
concludes that they are unable to accommodate a signifie constructed differently for
each occurrence of its significant. In other words, no a priori mechanisms (such as nec-
essary conditions, scriptal lexicons, or selectional features) offers a valid solution to
the problem of relevance. Finally, the section ends with philosophical considerations
regarding humanâ€”machine dialogs. The argument here is easy to follow, contrasting
with the burdened presentation of the rest of the section. The Turing test, viewed as
a founding technological myth, is quickly discarded and a list of six abilities missing
in current interfaces is established (including lying and negotiating). Rastier also re-
quires the system to model the user in order to attenuate the problem of relevance.

But in the end, Rastier rejects the maximalist AT goal of a perfect simulation, for &amp;quot;in
practice, the user knows very well if he is addressing a man or a machine, and adapts
consequently&amp;quot; (p. 174).
The last section of the book considers psychology and neurosciences from a se-
mantic perspective. Psycholinguistics is immediately discredited, as it keeps &apos;proving&apos;
Chomskyan theories without noticing their contradictions! Rastier&apos;s next target (the
word isn&apos;t too strong!) is Rosch&apos;s theory of categorization, which is swiftly demolished
from philosophical, linguistic, and methodological viewpoints, and labeled as an &amp;quot;im-
poverished variant of Aristotle&apos;s ideas&amp;quot; (p. 188). The underlying theme is familiar:
prototypes are merely universals. But Rastier&apos;s expertise, which allows him to exhibit
linguistic phenomena supporting a cultural diachronic view of tongues, makes this
entertaining reading.
Up to this point, the reader probably has only a fragmented view of Rastier&apos;s
proposal. In order to introduce a semiotic level per se, Rastier hypothesizes a seman-
tic perception, that is, semantic processing generally akin to form recognition. For
him, mental images are the psychological correlates of the linguistic signifies. It fol-
lows that propositionalism is once again thrashed. Semantics is taken to constrain
not only perception but also mental imagery, which depends on context and is taken
to be part of the referential process. Semantic dissimilation is related to perceptive
inhibition and semantic assimilation to priming. In effect, Rastier skillfully specifies
the delicate boundary between linguistics and psychology while constantly criticizing
the universalism subsuming cognitive psychology. The section ends with a scathing
review of Chomskyan nativism and Fodorian modularism, both contradicted, accord-
ing to Rastier, by recent results in neurosciences. Abandoning the Platonic idea of a
universal grammar, genetically encoded according to Chomsky, linguistics and neu-
rosciences must instead cooperate to understand the epigenesis of the brain and the
mechanisms of learning, especially in its socio-cultural facets.
The epilogue summarizes Rastier&apos;s anticognitivist positions and his thesis on the
existence of a semiotic level, mediating between the mental and neuronal states.
As a whole the book has a few more flaws than just the absence of any index and
some annoying editing mistakes, especially in the footnotes. First, Rastier says little
about connectionism. Despite flatly rejecting the neuronal metaphor, labeling massive
parallelism as just another technology, equating local connectionism to scriptal lexi-
cons, and complaining that connectionism still conflates signifies and representations,
Rastier praises Smolensky, some work on ambiguity, and the importance given to
learning. Second, Rastier does not elaborate on the positions of traditional opponents
of AT. Consequently, his anticomputationalist stance does not seem sufficiently moti-
vated. Third, he too often refers to his previous work without sufficiently elaborating
on his theses for this book to be self-contained. In some cases, the absence of an ad-
equate summary of his ideas results in opaque paragraphs that muddle his technical
explanations. The two-page glossary is of little help to the nonlinguist. Fourth, because
the book is not self-contained, some arguments in favor of differential semantics lose
some of their weight, and some of the discussion loses its sense of direction. At times,
especially in Section 2, the reader is saturated with attacks on cognitivism without
immediately being able to perceive Rastier&apos;s point and decide whether his proposals
address and solve the problems he presents. Typically, there is a serious shortage of
examples illustrating his proposed mechanisms, with the consequence that the book
will probably be unpalatable to the layman. Finally, a minor complaint: having linked
differential semantics to the French Enlightment, Saussure, and Greimas, the author
should have provided some comment on post-structuralism, reception theory, and
deconstruction.

In my opinion, this essay is important for computational linguists and cognitive
scientists in general, for it questions from the viewpoint of a scholar the foundations of
their work and sketches an alternative program of research for linguistics. In particular,
Rastier goes far beyond Sowa in tracing the origins of philosophical, psychological,
and linguistic theories. This is not a mere (highly instructive) exercise of erudition
but, as Rastier clearly states, a challenge to traditional occidental idealism. Also, this
historical perspective allows him to skin those researchers who &apos;discover&apos; ideas dating
to the nineteenth century, if not to Greek philosophers. Beyond Chomsky and Fodor,
Rastier&apos;s favorite targets include Rosch, Grice, Fillmore, and jackendoff. Finally, the
book is up to date on work in Al, and its caustic iconoclastic attacks on all (current
and historical) leaders of cognitive science are not only quite entertaining, but also
educational inasmuch as they suggest an interesting classification of a large body of
research.
