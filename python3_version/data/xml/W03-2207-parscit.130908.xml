At the core of the system is a hybrid multi-
engine embedded MT system: essentially an
EBMT system with a &amp;quot;translation memory&amp;quot; (TM)
extracted from corpora of doctor—patient
interviews, supplemented with a simple rule-based
MT (RBMT) system and a word-by-word lexical
look-up facility. It will have a highly flexible
interface: a simple set-up like in a chat-room,
where each user types at a keyboard with the
results shown on a split-screen is not practical
when one of the users may not be a regular
computer user.
The system in this mode has two users: the
doctor and the patient, with significantly different
profiles of computing experience. Accordingly, the
user-interfaces will be quite different for the two
users, while necessarily being integrated. Whereas
the doctor can be expected to use the keyboard and
mouse, and be comfortable with a sophisticated
GUI, the patient&apos;s interface presents a number of
problems.
Obviously, in the long-term we would want to
consider speech input and output for both the
doctor&apos;s and patient&apos;s interfaces. In the short term,
and given the current state-of-the-art, text-based
interfaces are proposed.
It should also be remembered that some patients
will not need to use the system for every part of the
interview, their English being sufficient for some
interactions. In addition to the &amp;quot;Consultation
mode&amp;quot;, we will simultaneously develop a
&amp;quot;Reception mode&amp;quot; with an interactive FAQ/help
system and a &amp;quot;History mode&amp;quot; involving a
computer-aided patient interview system.
In the following sections, we give some more
details about the design features of the different
modes of the proposed system.

MT has now proved itself viable under conditions

strategies in parallel and then tries to reconcile the

expected that the input from the doctor will usually
go through the EBMT system, while the patient&apos;s
input, being more varied, may more often be
translated by RBMT or on a word-by-word basis.
In the proposed scenario, it is an example of an
&amp;quot;embedded&amp;quot; MT system [20].
EBMT is akin to case-based reasoning (CBR)
[21] in that new translations are composed on the
basis of past translations, as provided by the
&amp;quot;example base&amp;quot; of utterances taken from a corpus
of doctor—patient interviews, manually translated
into the target language. This method gives a very
high quality of translation when the input can be
matched against an appropriate example. The
match does not have to be exact: as in CBR, a
partial match can lead to a successful outcome.
RBMT and word-by-word translation methods
tend to result in more stilted translations, closely
following the syntax of the source language. In our
scenario, this is more likely to be used for
translating the patient&apos;s replies into English: thus
the burden of understanding a less polished
translation will normally fall on the doctor, who
will gain experience of the system with use, and —
on the evidence of early users of less sophisticated
MT systems [22] — will quickly get used to its
quirky style.
The notion of &amp;quot;restricted input&amp;quot; relates to the
widely accepted notion of &amp;quot;sublanguage&amp;quot;-based
approaches to MT [23], especially inasmuch as a
corpus can help to defme the sublanguage [24].
The experience of the DIPLOMAT project is
especially relevant to this proposal, since their
system was developed specifically with rapid
development of new language pairs for use in a
dialogue situation between an experienced user and
a naive interviewee who may have little experience
of computers, and may not even be literate.
Versions of DIPLOMAT have been developed for
English—Croatian and English—Haitian Creole, for
use in the field to allow English-speaking soldiers
on peace-keeping missions to interview local
residents [25]. An additional feature of DIPLOMAT
is the use of speech-recognition and synthesis front
and back ends, and the extensive use of on-screen
