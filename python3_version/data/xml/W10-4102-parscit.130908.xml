Textual emotion recognition has gained a lot of
attention recent years; it is however less devel-
oped due to the complexity nature of emotion. In
this paper, we start with the discussion of a num-
ber of fundamental yet unresolved issues concern-
ing emotion, which includes its definition,
representation and technology. We then propose
an alternative solution for emotion recognition
taking into account of emotion causes. Two pilot
experiments are done to justify our proposal. The
first experiment explores the impact of emotion
recognition. It shows that the context contains rich
and crucial information that effectively help emo-
tion recognition. The other experiment examines
emotion cause events in the context. We find that
most emotions are expressed with the presence of
causes. The experiments prove that emotion cause
serves as an important cue for emotion recognition.
We suggest that the combination of both emotion
study and event analysis would be a fruitful direc-
tion for deep emotion processing.

<bodyText confidence="0.999951205128205">
The study of emotion attracts increasingly greater
attention in the field of NLP due to its emerging
wide applications, such as customer care (Gupta et
al., 2010), and social information understanding
(Lisa and Steyvers, 2010). In contrast to sentiment,
which is the external subjective evaluation, emo-
tion mainly concentrates on the internal mental
state of human (Ortony et al., 1987). Emotion is
indeed a highly complicated concept that raises a
lot of controversies in the theories of emotion re-
garding the fundamental issues such as emotion
definition, emotion structure and so on. The com-
plexity nature of emotion concept makes auto-
matic emotion processing rather challenging.
Most emotion studies put great effort on emo-
tion recognition, identifying emotion classes, such
as happiness, sadness, and fear. On top of this
surface level information, deeper level informa-
tion regarding emotions such as the experiencer,
cause, and result of an emotion, needs to be ex-
tracted and analyzed for real world applications.
In this paper, we discuss these two closely related
emotion tasks, namely emotion recognition and
emotion cause detection and how they contribute
to emotion processing.
For emotion recognition, we construct an emo-
tion corpus for explicit emotions with an unsuper-
vised method. Explicit emotions are emotions
represented by emotion keywords such as e.g.,
“shocked” in “He was shocked after hearing the
news”. In the course of emotion recognition, the
keyword in an explicit emotion expression is de-
leted and only contextual information remains. In
our pilot experiments, the context-based emotion
identification works fairly well. This implies that
plenty of information is provided in the context
for emotion recognition. Moreover, with an in-
depth analysis of the data, we observe that it is
often the case that emotions co-occur and interact
in a sentence. In this paper, we deal with emotion
recognition from a dependent view so as to cap-
ture complicated emotion expressions.
Emotion is often invoked by an event, which in
turn is very likely to elicit an event (Descartes
1649, James 1884, Plutchik 1980, Wierzbicka
1999). Despite the fact that most researches rec-
ognize the important role of events in emotion
theories, little work, if not none, attempts to make
explicit link between events and emotion. In this
paper, we examine emotion constructions based
on contextual information which often contains
considerable relevant eventive information. In
particular, the correlations between emotion and
cause events will be explored based on empirical
data. Emotion causes refer to explicitly expressed
propositions that evoke the corresponding emo-
tions.
To enhance emotion recognition, we examine
emotion causes occurring in the context of an
emotion. First, we manually annotate causes for
emotions in our explicit emotion corpus. Since an
emotion cause can be a complicated event, we
model emotion cause detection as a multi-label
problem to detect a cross-clause emotion cause.
Furthermore, an in-depth linguistic analysis is
done to capture the different constructions in ex-
pressing emotion causes.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
discusses some related work regarding emotion
recognition and emotion cause detection. In Sec-
tion 3, we present our context-based emotion cor-
pus and provide some data analysis. Section 4
describes our emotion recognition system, and
discusses the experiments and results. In Section 5,
we examine our emotion cause detection system,
and discuss the performances. Finally, Section 6
concludes our main findings for emotion process-
ing from the event perspective.

Most current emotion studies focus on the task of
emotion recognition, especially in affective lexi-
con construction. In comparison with emotion
recognition, emotion cause detection is a rather
new research area, which account for emotions
based on the correlations between emotions and
cause events. This section discusses the related
research on emotion recognition and emotion
cause detection.

2.1 Emotion Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999736472727273">
Although emotion recognition has been inten-
sively studied, some issues concerning emotion
remain unresolved, such as emotion definition,
emotion representation, and emotion classification
technologies.
For the emotion definition, emotion has been
well-known for its abstract and uncertain defini-
tion which hinders emotion processing as a whole.
Ortony et al., (1987) conducted an empirical study
for a structure of affective lexicon based on the
~500 words used in previous emotion studies.
However, most of the emotion corpora in NLP try
to avoid the emotion definition problem. Instead,
they choose to rely on the intuition of annotators
(Ren’s Blog Emotion Corpus, RBEC, Quan and
Ren, 2009) or authors (Mishne’s blog emotion
corpus, Mishne, 2005). Therefore, one of the cru-
cial drawbacks of emotion corpora is the problem
of poor quality. In this paper, we explore emotion
annotation from a different perspective. We con-
centrate on explicit emotions, and utilize their
contextual information for emotion recognition.
In terms of emotion representation, textual
emotion corpora are basically annotated using ei-
ther the enumerative representation or the compo-
sitional representation (Chen et al., 2009). The
enumerative representation assigns an emotion a
unique label, such as pride and jealousy. The
compositional representation represents an emo-
tion through a vector with a small set of fixed ba-
sic emotions with associated strength. For instance,
pride is decomposed into “happiness + fear” ac-
cording to Turner (2000).
With regard to emotion recognition technolo-
gies, there are two kinds of classification models.
One is based on an independent view (Mishne,
2005; Mihalcea and Liu, 2006; Aman and Szpa-
kowicz, 2007; Tokuhisa et al., 2008; Strapparava
and Mihalcea, 2008), and the other is a dependent
view (Abbasi et al, 2008; Keshtkar and Inkpen,
2009). The independent view treats emotions sep-
arately, and often chooses a single-label classifica-
tion approach to identify emotions. In contrast, the
dependent view takes into account complicated
emotion expressions, such as emotion interaction
and emotion co-occurrences, and thus requires
more complicated models. Abbasi et al. (2008)
adopt an ensemble classifier to detect the co-
occurrences of different emotions; Keshtkar and
Inkpen (2009) use iteratively single-label classifi-
ers in the top-down order of a given emotion hier-
archy. In this paper, we examine emotion
recognition as a multi-label problem and investi-
gate several multi-label classification approaches.

<bodyText confidence="0.999989263157895">
Although most emotion theories recognize the
important role of causes in emotion analysis (Des-
cartes, 1649; James, 1884; Plutchik, 1962; Wierz-
bicka 1996), yet very few studies in NLP explore
the event composition and causal relation of emo-
tions. As a pilot study, the current study proposes
an emotion cause detection system.
Emotion cause detection can be considered as a
kind of causal relation detection between two
events. In other words, emotion is envisioned as
an event type which triggers another event, i.e.
cause event. We attempt to examine emotion
cause relations for open domains. However, not
much work (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Girju,
2003; Chang and Choi, 2006) has been done on
this kind of general causal relation for open do-
mains.
Most existing causal relation detection systems
contain two steps: 1) cause candidate identifica-
tion; 2) causal relation detection. However, Step 1)
is often oversimplified in real systems. For exam-
ple, the cause-effect pairs are limited to two noun
phrases (Chang and Choi, 2005; Girju, 2003), or
two clauses connected with selected conjunction
words (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002). Moreover, the
task of Step 2) often is considered as a binary
classification problem, i.e. “causal” vs. “non-
causal”.
With regard to feature extraction, there are two
kinds of information extracted to identify the
causal relation in Step 2). One is constructions
expressing a cause-effect relation (Chang and
Choi, 2005; Girju, 2003), and the other is seman-
tic information in a text (Marcu and Echihabi,
2002; Persing and Ng, 2009), such as word pair
probability. Undoubtedly, the two kinds of infor-
mation often interact with each other in a real
cause detection system.

3.1 The Corpus for Emotion Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997796969697">
With the help of a set of rules and a collection of
high quality emotion keywords, a pattern-based
approach is used to extract emotional sentences
and neutral sentences from the Academia Sinica
Balanced Corpus of Mandarin Chinese (Sinica
Corpus). If an emotion keyword occurring in a
sentence satisfies the given patterns, its corre-
sponding emotion type will be listed for that sen-
tence. As for emotion recognition, each detected
keyword in a sentence is removed, in other words,
the sentence provides only the context of that
emotion. Due to the overwhelming of neutral sen-
tences, EASC only contains partial neutral sen-
tences besides emotional sentences. For
experiments, 995 sentences are randomly selected
for human annotation, which serve as the test data.
The remaining 17,243 sentences are used as the
training data.
In addition, in the course of creating the emo-
tion corpus, Chen et al. (2009) list the emotion
labels in a sentence using the enumerative repre-
sentation. Besides, an emotion taxonomy is pro-
vided to re-annotate an emotion with the
compositional representation. With the taxonomy,
an emotion is decomposed into a combination of
primary emotions (i.e. happiness, fear, anger,
sadness, and surprise).
From this corpus, we observe that —54% emo-
tional sentences contain two emotions, yet only
—2% sentences contain more than two emotions.
This implies emotion recognition is a typical mul-
ti-label problem. Particularly, more effort should
be put on the co-occurrences of two emotions.

3.2 The Corpus for Emotion Cause De-
tection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954833333333">
Most emotion theories agree that the five primary
emotions (i.e. happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and
surprise) are prototypical emotions. Therefore, for
emotion cause detection, we only deal with the
emotional sentences containing a keyword repre-
senting one of these primary emotions. Beyond a
focus sentence, its context (the previous sentence
and the following sentence) is also extracted, and
those three sentences constitute an entry. After
filtering non-emotional and ambiguous sentences,
5,629 entries remain in the emotion cause corpus.
Each emotion keyword is annotated with its
corresponding causes if existing. An emotion
keyword can sometimes be associated with more
than one cause, in such a case, both causes are
marked. Moreover, the cause type is also identi-
fied, which is either a nominal event or a verbal
event (a verb or a nominalization).
From the corpus, we notice that 72% of the ex-
tracted entries express emotions, and 80% of the
emotional entries have a cause, which means that
causal event is a strong indicator for emotion rec-
ognition.
Furthermore, since the actual cause can some-
times be so complicated that it involves several
events, we investigate the span of a cause text as
follows. For each emotion keyword, an entry is
segmented into clauses with some punctuations,
and thus an entry becomes a list of cause candi-
dates. In terms of the cause distribution, we find
~90% causes occurring between ‘left_2’ and
‘right_1’. Therefore, our cause search is limited to
the list of cause candidates which contains five
text units, i.e. &lt;left_2, left_1, left_0, right_0,
right_1&gt;. If the clause where emotion keyword
locates is assumed as a focus clause, ‘left_2’ and
‘left_1’ are the two previous clauses, and ‘right_1’
is the following one. ‘left_0’ and ‘right_0’ are the
partial texts of the focus clause, which locate in
the left side of and the right side of the emotion
keyword, respectively. Finally, we find that ~14%
causes occur cross clauses.

4.1 Multi-label Classification for Emo-
tion recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933307692308">
Based on our corpus, two critical issues for emo-
tion recognition need to be dealt with: emotion
interaction and emotion co-occurrences. Co-
occurrence of multiple emotions in a sentence
makes emotion recognition a multi-label problem.
Furthermore, the interaction among different emo-
tions in a sentence requires a multi-label model to
have a dependent view. In this paper, we explore
two simple multi-label models for emotion recog-
nition.
The Binary-based (BB) model: decompose the
task into multiple independent binary classifiers
(i.e., “1” for the presence of one emotion; “0” for
the absence of one emotion), where each emotion
is allocated a classifier. For each test instance, all
labels (emotions) from the classifiers compose a
vector.
The label powset (LP) model: treat each possible
combination of labels appearing in the training
data as a unique label, and convert multi-label
classification to single-label classification.
Both the BB model and the LP model need a
multi-class classifier. For our experiment, we
choose a Max Entropy package, Mallet1. In this
paper, we use only words in the focus sentence as
features.

4.2 Emotion Recognition Experiments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984384615385">
To demonstrate the impact of our context-based
emotion corpus to emotion recognition, we com-
pare EASC data to Ren’s Blog Emotion Corpus
(RBEC). RBEC is a human-annotated emotion
corpus for both explicit emotions and implicit
emotions. It adopts the compositional representa-
tion with eight emotion dimensions (anger, anxi-
ety, expect, hate, joy, love, sorrow, and surprise).
For each dimension, a numerical value ranging in
{0.0, 0.1, 0.2... 1.0} indicates the intensity of the
emotion in question. There are totally 35,096 sen-
tences in RBEC. To fairly compare with the
EASC data, we convert a numerical value to a
binary value. An emotion exists in a sentence only
when its corresponding intensity value is greater
than 0.
For RBEC data, we use 80% of the corpus as
the training data, 10% as the development data,
and 10% as the test data. For EASC, apart from
the test data, we divide its training data into two
sets: 90% for our training data, and 10% for our
development data. For evaluation of a multi-label
task, three measures are used: accuracy (extract
match ratio), Micro F1, and Macro F1. Accuracy
is the extract match ratio of the whole assignments
in data, and Micro F1 and Macro F1 are the aver-

percentage of value 0 in the multi-label task, dur-
ing the calculating of Micro F1 and Macro F1,
most previous multi-label systems take only value
1 (indicating the existence of the emotion) into
account.
In Table 1, we notice that the emotion recogni-
tion system on our context-based corpus achieves
similar performance as the one on human-
annotated corpus. This implies that there is rich
contextual information with respect to emotion
identification.

Most emotion theories agree that there is a strong
relationship between emotions and events (Des-
cartes 1649, James 1884, Plutchik 1980, Wierz-
bicka 1999). Among the rich information in the
context of an emotion, cause event is the most
crucial component of emotion. We therefore at-
tempt to explore emotion causes, and extract
causes for emotion automatically.

5.1 Emotion Cause Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936344827586">
Based on the cause distribution analysis in Section
3.2, in contrast to binary classification used in
previous work, we formalize emotion cause detec-
tion as a multi-label problem as follows.
Given an emotion keyword and its context, its
label is the locations of its causes, such as “left_1,
left_0”. Then, we use the LP model to identify the
cause for each sentence as well as an emotion
keyword. With regard to emotion cause detection,
the LP model is more suitable than the BB model
because the LP model can easily capture the pos-
sible label combinations.
In terms of feature extraction, unlike emotion
recognition, emotion cause detection relies more
on linguistic constructions, such as “The BP oil
spill makes the country angry”, “I am sad because
of the oil spill problem” and so on.
According to our linguistic analysis, we cre-
ate 14 patterns to extraction some common emo-
tion cause expressions. Some patterns are
designed for general cause detection using linguis-
tic cues such as conjunctions and prepositions.
Others are designed for some specific emotion
cause expressions, such as epistemic markers and
reported verbs. Furthermore, to avoid the low
coverage problem of the rule-based patterns, we
create another set of features, which is a group of
generalized patterns. For details, please refer to
Chen et al. (2010).

5.2 Experiments

<bodyText confidence="0.999976769230769">
For EASC, we reserve 80% as the training data,
10% as the development data, and 10% as the test
data. For evaluation, we first convert a multi-label
tag outputted from our system into a binary tag
(‘Y’ means the presence of a causal relation; ‘N’
means the absence of a causal relation) between
the emotion keyword and each candidate in its
corresponding cause candidates. We then adopt
three common measures, i.e. precision, recall and
F-score, to evaluate the result.
A naive baseline is designed as follows: The
baseline searches for the cause candidates in the
order of &lt;left_1, right_0, left_2, left_0, right_1&gt;.
If the candidate contains a noun or a verb, this
clause is considered as a cause and the search
stops.
Table 2 shows the overall performances of our
emotion cause detection system. First, our system
based on a multi-label approach as well as power-
ful linguistic features significantly outperforms
the naïve baseline. Moreover, the greatest im-
provement is attributed to the 14 linguistic pat-
terns (LP). This implies the importance of
linguistic cues for cause detection. Moreover, the
general patterns (GP) achieve much better per-
formance on the recall and yet slightly hurt on the
precision.
The performances (F-scores) for ‘Y’ and ‘N’
tags separately are shown in Table 3. First, we
notice that the performances of the ‘N’ tag are
much better than the ones of ‘Y’ tag. Second, it is
surprising that incorporating the linguistic features
significantly improves the ‘Y’ tag only (from 33%
to 56%), but does not affect ‘N’ tag. This suggests
that our linguistic features are effective to detect
the presence of causal relation, and yet do not hurt
the detections of ‘non_causal’ relation. Further-
more, the general feature achieves ~8% improve-
ments for the ‘Y’ tag.

Many previous works on emotion recognition
concentrated on emotion keyword detection.
However, Ortony et al. (1987) pointed out the dif-
ficulty of emotion keyword annotation, be it man-
ual or automatic annotation. Emotion keywords
are rather ambiguous, and also contain other in-
formation besides affective information, such as
behavior and cognition. Therefore, contextual in-
formation provides important cues for emotion
recognition. Furthermore, we propose an alterna-
tive way to explore emotion recognition, which is
based on emotion cause. Through two pilot ex-
periments, we justify the importance of emotion
contextual information for emotion recognition,
particularly emotion cause.
We first examine emotion processing in terms
of events. Context information is found to be very
important for emotion recognition. Furthermore,
most emotions are expressed with the presence of
causes in context, which implies that emotion
cause is the crucial information for emotion rec-
ognition. In addition, emotion cause detection also
explores deep understanding of an emotion. Com-
pared to emotion recognition, emotion cause de-
tection requires more semantic and pragmatic
information. In this paper, based on the in-depth
linguistic analysis, we extract different kinds of
constructs to identify cause events for an emotion.
To conclude, emotion processing is a compli-
cated problem. In terms of emotion keywords,
how to understand appropriately to enhance emo-
tion recognition needs more exploration. With
respect to emotion causes, first, event processing
itself is a challenging topic, such as event extrac-
tion and co-reference. Second, how to combine
event and emotion in NLP is still unclear, but it is
a direction for further emotion studies.

<abstract confidence="0.997914363636364">Textual emotion recognition has gained a lot of attention recent years; it is however less developed due to the complexity nature of emotion. In this paper, we start with the discussion of a number of fundamental yet unresolved issues concerning emotion, which includes its definition, representation and technology. We then propose an alternative solution for emotion recognition taking into account of emotion causes. Two pilot experiments are done to justify our proposal. The first experiment explores the impact of emotion recognition. It shows that the context contains rich and crucial information that effectively help emotion recognition. The other experiment examines emotion cause events in the context. We find that most emotions are expressed with the presence of causes. The experiments prove that emotion cause serves as an important cue for emotion recognition. We suggest that the combination of both emotion study and event analysis would be a fruitful direction for deep emotion processing.</abstract>

For experiments, 995 sentences are randomly selected for human annotation, which serve as the test data. The remaining 17,243 sentences are used as the training data. In addition, in the course of creating the emotion corpus, Chen et al. (2009) list the emotion labels in a sentence using the enumerative representation. Besides, an emotion taxonomy is provided to re-annotate an emotion with the compositional representation. With the taxonomy, an emotion is decomposed into a combination of primary emotions (i.e. happiness, fear, anger, sadness, and surprise). From this corpus, we observe that —54% emotional sentences contain two emotions, yet only —2% sentences contain more than two emotions.

Others are designed for some specific emotion cause expressions, such as epistemic markers and reported verbs. Furthermore, to avoid the low coverage problem of the rule-based patterns, we create another set of features, which is a group of generalized patterns. For details, please refer to Chen et al.

In contrast to sentiment, which is the external subjective evaluation, emotion mainly concentrates on the internal mental state of human (Ortony et al., 1987). Emotion is indeed a highly complicated concept that raises a lot of controversies in the theories of emotion regarding the fundamental issues such as emotion definition, emotion structure and so on. The complexity nature of emotion concept makes automatic emotion processing rather challenging. Most emotion studies put great effort on emotion recognition, identifying emotion classes, such as happiness, sadness, and fear. On top of this surface level information, deeper level information regarding emotions such as the experiencer, cause, and result of an emotion, needs to be extracted and anal</context>

For the emotion definition, emotion has been well-known for its abstract and uncertain definition which hinders emotion processing as a whole. Ortony et al., (1987) conducted an empirical study for a structure of affective lexicon based on the ~500 words used in previous emotion studies. However, most of the emotion corpora in NLP try to avoid the emotion definition problem. Instead, they choose to rely on the intuition of annotators (Ren’s Blog Emotion Corpus, RBEC, Quan and Ren, 2009) or authors (Mishne’s blog emotion corpus, Mishne, 2005). Therefore, one of the crucial drawbacks of emotion corpora is the problem of poor quality. In this paper, we explore emotion annotation from a different perspective. We concentrate on explicit emotions, and utilize </context>

However, Ortony et al. (1987) pointed out the difficulty of emotion keyword annotation, be it manual or automatic annotation. Emotion keywords are rather ambiguous, and also contain other information besides affective information, such as behavior and cognition. Therefore, contextual information provides important cues for emotion recognition. Furthermore, we propose an alternative way to explore emotion recognition, which is based on emotion cause. Through two pilot experiments, we justify the importance of emotion contextual information for emotion recognition, particularly emotion cause. We first examine emotion proces</context>

Moreover, the task of Step 2) often is considered as a binary classification problem, i.e. “causal” vs. “noncausal”. With regard to feature extraction, there are two kinds of information extracted to identify the causal relation in Step 2). One is constructions expressing a cause-effect relation (Chang and Choi, 2005; Girju, 2003), and the other is semantic information in a text (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Persing and Ng, 2009), such as word pair probability. Undoubtedly, the two kinds of information often interact with each other in a real cause detection system. 3 Emotion Annotated Sinica Corpus (EASC) EASC is an emotion annotated corpus comprising two kinds of sentences: emotional-sentence corpus and neutral-sentence corpus. It involves two components: one for emotion recognition, which is created with an unsupervised method (Chen et al. 3.1 The Corpus for Emotion Recognition With the help of a set of rules and a collection of high quality emotion keywords, a pattern-based approach is used to extract emotional se</context>

In our pilot experiments, the context-based emotion identification works fairly well. This implies that plenty of information is provided in the context for emotion recognition. Moreover, with an indepth analysis of the data, we observe that it is often the case that emotions co-occur and interact in a sentence. In this paper, we deal with emotion recognition from a dependent view so as to capture complicated emotion expressions. Emotion is often invoked by an event, which in turn is very likely to elicit an event (Descartes 1649, James 1884, Plutchik 1980, Wierzbicka 1999). Despite the fact that most researches recognize the important role of events in emotion theories, little work, if not none, attempts to make explicit link between events and emotion. In this paper, we examine emotion constructions based on contextual information which often contains considerable relevant eventive information. In particular, the correlations between emotion and cause events will be explored based on empirical data. Emotion causes refer to explicitly expressed propositions that evoke the corresponding emotions. To enhance emotion recognition, we examine emoti</context>

In Table 1, we notice that the emotion recognition system on our context-based corpus achieves similar performance as the one on humanannotated corpus. This implies that there is rich contextual information with respect to emotion identification. 5 Emotion Cause Detection Most emotion theories agree that there is a strong relationship between emotions and events (Descartes 1649, James 1884, Plutchik 1980, Wierzbicka 1999). Among the rich information in the context of an emotion, cause event is the most crucial component of emotion. We therefore attempt to explore emotion causes, and extract causes for emotion automatically. 5.1 Emotion Cause Detection Based on the cause distribution analysis in Section 3.2, in contrast to binary classification used in previous work, we formalize emotion cause detection as a multi-label problem as follows. Given an emotion keyword and its context, its label is the locations of its causes, such as “left_1, left_0”. Then, we use the LP model to identify the caus</context>

The enumerative representation assigns an emotion a unique label, such as pride and jealousy. The compositional representation represents an emotion through a vector with a small set of fixed basic emotions with associated strength. For instance, pride is decomposed into “happiness + fear” according to Turner (2000). With regard to emotion recognition technologies, there are two kinds of classification models. One is based on an independent view (Mishne, 2005; Mihalcea and Liu, 2006; Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007; Tokuhisa et al., 2008; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008), and the other is a dependent view (Abbasi et al, 2008; Keshtkar and Inkpen, 2009). The independent view treats emotions separately, and often chooses a single-label classification approach to identify emotions. In contrast, the dependent view takes into account complicated emotion expressions, such as emotion interaction and emotion co-occurrences, and thus requires more complicated models. Abbasi et al.
