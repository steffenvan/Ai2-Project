Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.998972666666667">
The question of whether metonymy carries across languages has always been interesting for language
representation and processing. Until now attempts to answer this question have always been based on
small-scale analyses. With the advent of EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998), a multilingual thesaurus covering
eight languages and organized along the same lines as WordNet (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/)
we have a unique opportunity to research this question on a large scale. In this paper we systematically
explore sets of concepts comprising possible metonymic relations that have been identified in WordNet.
The sets of concepts are evaluated, and a contrastive analysis of their lexicalization patterns in English,
Dutch and Spanish is performed. Our investigation gives insight into the cross-linguistic nature of
metonymic polysemy and defines a methodology for dynamic extensions of semantic resources.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999555938775511">
Viewed traditionally, metonymy is a non-
literal figure of speech in which the name of
one thing is substituted for that of another
related to it. It has been described as a
cognitive process in which one conceptual
entity, the vehicle, provides mental access to
another conceptual entity (Radden 1999). In
its basic form, it establishes a semantic
relation between two concepts that are
associated with word forms. The semantic
shift expressed by the relation may or may
not be accompanied by a shift in form. The
semantic relation that is captured by
metonymy is one of semantic contiguity, in
the sense that in many cases there are
systematic relations between metonymically
related concepts that can be regarded as slots
in conceptual frames (cf. Fillmore 1977).
For example, in the sentence ‘The colonies
revolted against the crown.’ crown is used as
a symbol for the monarchy as well as
denoting the traditional head ornament worn
by the monarch. As the example above
shows, polysemy is a common way in which
metonymically related concepts manifest
themselves in language.
It is to be expected that any systematic
semantic relations between concepts
expressed by these sense distinctions are
lexicalized, i.e. they are explicitly listed in
dictionaries and independent of a pragmatic
situation. For example, university is on the
one hand an institution and on the other a
building. The semantic relation between the
two senses is ‘is housed in’.
Regular polysemy is a subset of metonymy
that covers the systematicity of the semantic
relations involved. It can be defined as a
subset of metonymically related senses of
the same word displaying a conventional as
opposed to novel type of semantic contiguity
relation. This relation holds for related
senses of two or more words (Apresjan,
1973), i.e. is a lexicalized pattern, not a
nonce formation (a pragmatically defined
novel metonymy), and can therefore be
called regular. It is this subtype of
metonymy that we concentrate on in this
paper.

2. Regular polysemy across languages
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989523952380952">
The question whether regular polysemy is a
cross-linguistic phenomenon has until now
only been approached by small scale
analyses.
For instance, Kamei and Wakao (Kamei,
1992) approached the question from the
perspective of machine translation and
conducted a comparative survey of the
acceptability of metonymic expressions in
English, Chinese and Japanese consisting of
25 test sentences. The results they report
show that in some cases English and
Japanese share metonymic patters to the
exclusion of Chinese, but that in others
English and Chinese team up.
(Seto1996) performed a study into the
lexicalization of the container-content
schema in various languages (Japanese,
Korean, Mongolian, Javanese, Turkish,
Italian, Germanic and English). This pattern
is lexicalized in English by ‘kettle’:
</bodyText>

1. A metal pot for stewing or boiling;
usually with a lid
2. The quantity a kettle will hold
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999669517241379">
His observation was that the pattern is
observable in all languages, and can be
considered cross-linguistic. This small study
seems to indicate that the regular polysemic
pattern extends over language family
boundaries to such an extent that it almost
seems universal. This could suggest that the
pattern is rooted in general human
conceptualisation, and reflects an important
non-arbitrary semantic relation between
concepts or objects in the world. Indeed, if
we describe the relation between container
and content in terms of Aristotle’s qualia
structure (Pustejovsky 1995), we see that it
is the function of a container to hold an
object or substance (telic role) and that a
container is normally brought into existence
for this purpose.
More small-scale studies like the ones
described above have been performed,
mostly relying on introspection and small-
scale dictionary analysis. A limited number
of patterns that are valid in more than one
language have been identified such as
container/content and producer/product
(Peters 2000). With the availability of
WordNet and EuroWordNet it has become
possible to investigate the cross-linguistic
nature of metonymy on a large scale.

3. EuroWordNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998102269230769">
EuroWordNet (EWN) (Vossen 1997; Peters
1998) is a multilingual thesaurus
incorporating wordnets from eight
languages: English, Italian, Dutch, German,
Spanish, French, Czech, Estonian. The
wordnets have been built in various ways.
Some of them have been created on the basis
of language specific resources and matched
onto the original Princeton WordNet
(Fellbaum 1998) when the interlingual
relations were created. They therefore reflect
the language specific lexicalization patterns
and semantic organization. Others have been
built from the start on the basis of a match
between WordNet and bilingual dictionaries.
In this case the conceptual structure is less
language specific but can be regarded as the
conceptual overlap between the structure of
the English WordNet and the ontological
structure associated with that particular
language.
EuroWordNet gives us for the first time the
opportunity to examine the question of the
language independence of regular polysemy
in a more systematic and automatic way.
The following methodology has been

4. Methodology followed:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916571428571">
First, the hierarchy of WordNet1.6 was
analysed in order to obtain English
candidates for regular polysemic patterns
(section 4.1). Then a process we call lexical
triangulation was applied to these data
within EuroWordNet (section 4.2). The
results were then manually evaluated.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999443">
4.1 Automatic candidate selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994284962962963">
A technique was developed (Peters 2000)
for identifying sense combinations in
WordNet where the senses involved
potentially display a regular polysemic
relation, i.e. where the senses involved are
candidates for systematic relatedness.
In order to obtain these candidate patterns
WordNet (WN) has been automatically
analysed by exploiting its hierarchical
structure. Wherever there are two or more
words with senses in one part of the hierar-
chy, which also have senses in another part
of the hierarchy, then we have a candidate
pattern of regular polysemy. The patterns
are candidates because there seems to be an
observed regularity for two or more words.
This follows the definition of (Apresjan
1973) mentioned in the introduction.
An example can be found in Figure 1 below.
fabric covering hypernym combination
(something made by weaving or (a natural object that covers or envelops)
felting or knitting or crocheting natural or
synthetic fibers)

<bodyText confidence="0.999906142857143">
We have restricted our experiments to cases
where the related meanings are of the same
syntactic class (nouns). The procedure does
not discover all regular polysemy relations,
because the outcome is heavily dependent
on the consistency of the encoding of these
regularities in WordNet.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996437">
4.2 Lexical triangulation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928592592593">
In order to determine whether regular
polysemy is indeed a cross-linguistic
phenomenon, one needs to compare
languages, preferably from different
language families.
Data will depend heavily on vocabulary
coverage in various languages, and until the
advent of EuroWordNet no serious lexical
data sets were available for analysis. The
EuroWordNet database is the most
comprehensive multilingual thesaurus to
date. This resource not only provides us with
an appropriate amount of lexical information
in terms of vocabulary coverage, but also
has the additional advantages that its
taxonomic building blocks are identical for
all languages involved and the language
specific concepts are all linked to an
interlingua which is based on the full set of
the original Princeton WordNet (version
1.5), and is referred to as the interlingual
index (ILI).
We started with a comparative analysis of
Germanic and Romance languages. The
main reason for this is that the size of the
corresponding wordnets is large enough to
yield significant results. For our analysis we
used three languages: English, Dutch and
Spanish, hence the term for this process:
lexical triangulation.
Singling out areas where three language-
specific lexicalization patterns converge
enabled us to identify metonymic patterns
that supported the hypothesis that certain
metonymic relationships have a higher
degree of universality.
We extracted the sense combinations of
Spanish and Dutch words that participate in
any of the potential regular polysemic
patterns from the initial large set described
in section 4.1. In other words, we
concentrate here on lexicalization patterns in
three different languages: sense
combinations that are lexicalized by one
language-specific word in English, Spanish
and Dutch.
The first step in this process was the
reduction of the search space for regular
polysemic patterns in EuroWordNet. First
we determined the conceptual overlap for
nouns between the English, Dutch and
Spanish wordnets. Table 1 below shows the
number of nouns in the three wordnets
involved.

5. Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967983581699346">
The conceptual overlap between these
wordnets is computed simply by
determining the intersection of ILI noun
concepts covered by each of the wordnets.
The total overlap is 17007 ILI concepts.
There are 920 English polysemous nouns
with two senses or more within synsets
linked to this set of ILI concepts. Their
senses have identical language specific
lexicalizations in Spanish and Dutch. For
example, the English word church has one
sense that is a building and another that is an
institution. The same sense distinctions
apply to the Spanish iglesia and the Dutch
kerk. The senses in the different wordnets
are linked through the ILI concepts by
means of equivalence synonymy or near-
synonymy relations (Vossen 1997).
The second step was to map these noun
senses onto the results from the wordnet
analysis described in section 4.1, and then to
evaluate the cross-linguistic validity of the
regular
polysemic patterns that have been projected
from the English monolingual wordnet onto
the Dutch and Spanish wordnets.
The cross-linguistic filter yields a subset of
the monolingual analysis data described in
section 4.1. It covers 404 distinct English
nouns out of a total of 8062 (5%).
This original filter considered nouns
satisfying the criteria of Apresjan (cf.
section 1), i.e. they are one of at least 2
words with sense distinctions that exhibit a
particular relationship.
The percentage covered by the cross-
linguistic data compared to the original
analysis gradually varies from a 100% for
the very small potential classes of regular
polysemy (2-3 words) to 1-2% for middle
sized (30-50 words) and large classes (100+
words).
In order to create a set for manual
evaluation, the set of 404 English nouns was
reduced by strengthening the Apresjan
criterion and requiring that a word be
considered only if it was one of at least a
three word set illustrating the regular
polysemy (RP). We will refer to this as a
three-word RP class. The rationale behind
this was that two word candidate RP classes
introduce noise because of the increased
probability of a fortuitous coincidence of
senses belonging to a set of just two words.
This step reduced the number of
participating words to 394. At this point,
177 words were randomly chosen from this
set for manual evaluation. The evaluation
consisted of examining the hypernym pairs
that reflect a candidate regular polysemic
relation.1 The criteria used in this step are
semantic homogeneity (the semantic relation
that defines the candidate RP class should
apply to the majority of the participating
words) and specificity of the pattern (the
lower the position of the hypernymic pair in
the hierarchy, the more specific the semantic
relation).
109 of these words displayed valid regular
polysemic patterns (62%), 68 did not (38%).
This means that by means of this automatic
filtering method we have a 62% success rate
for identifying valid regular polysemic
patterns. Below are a few examples of cross-
linguistic RP classes that have satisfied the
criteria of the evaluation.

1 A complication arises because many
combinations of hypernym pairs can be
considered for the same set of words. (In fact the
possibilities are the Cartesian product of the
ancestors of each of the hypernyms in the pair).
If all hypernymic combinations were taken into
account this amounts to an average of 17 classes
per word.

6. Universality of regular polysemy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999568523809524">
It is possible to view these results as an
indication of the cross-linguistic validity of
the regular polysemic patterns and their
level of universality relative to the language
families represented by the wordnets. The
hypothesis is that if a metonymic pattern
occurs in several languages, there is stronger
evidence for a higher level of universality of
the regular polysemic pattern.
Of course there is interference with the
coverage of the wordnets in EuroWordNet.
Since the Dutch and Spanish wordnets are
only half the size of the English wordnet
only limited coverage can be expected. Still,
the coverage seems to be consistently low in
most cases, often not more than 2-5%. On
the basis of wordnet size only one would
expect a higher coverage.
There are other explanations for the lack of
identical lexicalizations in other target
language wordnets:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.88425825">
1. The metonymic pattern is language
specific, and is not realised as a
polysemous word in the target language.
For example, the Dutch kantoor is
synonymous to the English office in the
sense ‘where professional or clerical
duties are performed’, but its sense
distinctions can not mirror the regular
polysemic relation in English with ‘a job
in an organization or hierarchy’.
2. The pattern is unattested in the target
language in terms of usage but forms a
potential sense extension in that
language. For instance, the Spanish
iglesia and the Dutch kerk both mean
‘building for worship’ and ‘a service
conducted in a church’. The Spanish
wordnet has an additional systematically
related sense for iglesia (‘institution to
express belief in a divine power’) that is

<bodyText confidence="0.8904368">

not shared by its Dutch counterpart but
is a valid new sense.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8374325">
3. The missing sense can in fact only be
lexicalized by another word or
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.972559041666667">
compound or derivation related to the
word with the potentially missing sense.
For example, the Dutch vereniging has
the sense (an association of people with
similar interests). The English
equivalent is club, for which there is
another sense in Wordnet (a building
occupied by a club). This is not a
felicitous sense extension for the Dutch
vereniging, because the favoured
lexicalization is the compound
verenigingshuis (club house).
4. The metonymic pattern is in fact attested
in the language, but one or more senses
participating in the patterns has not yet
been captured in the wordnet. One of the
reasons could be the sense granularity of
the resource on the basis of which the
wordnet has been built. For example,
embassy has one sense in WordNet (a
building where ambassadors live or
work). The Dutch translational
equivalent ambassade has an additional
sense denoting the people representing
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.784081142857143">
their country. This sense can be
projected to the English WordNet as a
regular polysemy pattern that is also
valid in English. In fact, LDOCE
(Procter,1978) only lists the sense which
is missing in WordNet.
7. Coverage and extendibility
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.93388085915493">
There are many RP classes whose English
word members do not all have a Dutch or
Spanish counterpart. We wanted to evaluate
the universality of the regular polysemic
relations by testing native speaker intuitions
about these regular polysemic gaps. This
was done by projecting the senses of the
participating English words in an RP class
onto Dutch and Spanish, and to assess
whether the missing senses were adequate
additional senses in these two languages.
The experiment we conducted was very
small. We intend to perform more
experiments of this kind in the future. The
pattern we examined is the hypernymic
combination
occupation (the principal activity in your
life) – discipline (a branch of knowledge).
This RP class has five members. Two Dutch
and two Spanish native speakers were asked
to judge the felicitousness of the senses that
are missing in the Dutch and Spanish
wordnets. Below is a short discussion of
each member.
interior design
1. the trade of planning the layout and
furnishings of an architectural interior
2. the branch of architecture dealing with the
selection and organization of furnishings for
an architectural interior
The corresponding Dutch word
binnenhuisarchitectuur has only one sense
which is linked to both WordNet senses by
means of a near-synonymy relation. This
means that the Dutch wordnet is
underspecified for the distinction of these
metonymically related senses and can be
extended with the specific sense distinctions
(see explanation 4 above). This coincided
with the verdict of the Dutch jury.
The Spanish WordNet has a separate
translation for each sense: interiorismo
(corresponding to interior design 1) and
deseno de interiores (corresponding to
interior design 2). The latter translational
equivalent was considered to also have a
possible trade reading.
law
1. the learned profession that is mastered by
graduate study in a law school and that is
responsible for the judicial system
4. the branch of philosophy concerned with
the law
The Dutch ‘rechtswetenschap’ has only
one sense, which is linked to both WordNet
senses by means of a near-synonymy
relation. This again means that the Dutch
wordnet is underspecified for the distinction
of these metonymically related senses and
can be extended with the specific sense
distinctions (see explanation 4 above). This
coincided with the verdict of the Dutch jury.
The Spanish equivalent of law 4 is
jurisprudencia, whereas law 1 does not have
a correspondence in the Spanish wordnet.
The profession reading was not considered a
felicitous additional sense for this word.
Both subjects remarked that another word
captures both meaning: leyes, which is not
present in the Spanish wordnet.
literature:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.881826333333333">
1. the profession or art of a writer
2. the humanistic study of a body of
literature
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.946536333333333">
The Dutch letterkunde is only linked up to
sense literature no. 2. Sense no. 1 was not
considered to be a straightforward new sense
for this word by the judges.
The Spanish literatura lacks a profession
reader in the Spanish wordnet. This sense
was considered as valid by one subject, but
rejected by the other subject.
politics
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.943936">
1. the profession devoted to governing and
to political affairs
2. the study of government of states and
other political units
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.923321515151515">
The Dutch word politicologie also has only
one sense that is linked to both WordNet
senses by means of a near-synonymy
relation. This again means that the Dutch
wordnet is underspecified for the distinction
of these metonymically related senses and
can be extended with the specific sense
distinctions. The Dutch subjects, however,
were not happy with the profession reading.
The Spanish política lacks a profession
reading in the Spanish wordnet. The Spanish
subjects considered this a valid sense for this
word.
theology
1. the learned profession acquired by
specialized courses in religion (usually
taught at a college or seminary
2. the rational and systematic study of
religion and its influences and of the nature
of religious truth
The Dutch theologie has no profession
reading. This reading was considered valid
by the Dutch subjects.
The Spanish teología has both senses in the
Spanish wordnet, and this coincides with the
subjects’ intuition.
The results are summarized in table 2
below. Overall, the projection of the word
senses onto the Dutch wordnet yields a
sense extension for one word out of a
possible two. For the Spanish wordnet the
same process creates valid new senses for
two out of four words.

8. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984535714286">
We have described a methodology for
systematically and automatically
investigating the question of whether or not
certain kinds of metonymic relationships
hold across languages. We used
EuroWordNet as the test bed for this
investigation, although the technique is not
limited to EuroWordNet and will apply to
any multilingual resource that captures
hypernymic relationships and has some
notion of correspondences among
languages. Our manual evaluation shows
regular polysemy patterns to be valid across
the three languages examined, and indicates
that regular polysemy has a certain level of
universality. Also, the results of the
experiment indicate a potential for
enhancing the semantic compatibility and
consistency of wordnets. Wordnets are
automatically extendable on the basis of
regular polysemic information available
from other wordnets. In our small
experiment 50% of the Dutch and Spanish
words that do not display a WordNet-
derived regular polysemic pattern were
successfully semantically enriched with this
pattern. Future work will involve further
experimentation.

<abstract confidence="0.9984265">The question of whether metonymy carries across languages has always been interesting for language representation and processing. Until now attempts to answer this question have always been based on small-scale analyses. With the advent of EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998), a multilingual thesaurus covering eight languages and organized along the same lines as WordNet (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/) we have a unique opportunity to research this question on a large scale. In this paper we systematically explore sets of concepts comprising possible metonymic relations that have been identified in WordNet. The sets of concepts are evaluated, and a contrastive analysis of their lexicalization patterns in English, Dutch and Spanish is performed. Our investigation gives insight into the cross-linguistic nature of metonymic polysemy and defines a methodology for dynamic extensions of semantic resources.</abstract>

For example, university is on the one hand an institution and on the other a building. The semantic relation between the two senses is ‘is housed in’. Regular polysemy is a subset of metonymy that covers the systematicity of the semantic relations involved. It can be defined as a subset of metonymically related senses of the same word displaying a conventional as opposed to novel type of semantic contiguity relation. This relation holds for related senses of two or more words (Apresjan, 1973), i.e. is a lexicalized pattern, not a nonce formation (a pragmatically defined novel metonymy), and can therefore be called regular. It is this subtype of metonymy that we concentrate on in this paper. 2. Regular polysemy across languages The question whether regular polysemy is a cross-linguistic phenomenon has until now only been approached by small scale analyses. For instance, Kamei and Wakao (Kamei, 1992) approached the question from the perspective of machine translation and conducted a comparative survey of the acceptability of metonymic expressions in English, Chinese and Japanese con</context>

In order to obtain these candidate patterns WordNet (WN) has been automatically analysed by exploiting its hierarchical structure. Wherever there are two or more words with senses in one part of the hierarchy, which also have senses in another part of the hierarchy, then we have a candidate pattern of regular polysemy. The patterns are candidates because there seems to be an observed regularity for two or more words. This follows the definition of (Apresjan 1973) mentioned in the introduction. An example can be found in Figure 1 below. fabric covering hypernym combination (something made by weaving or (a natural object that covers or envelops) felting or knitting or crocheting natural or synthetic fibers) fleece words whose senses occur under both hypernyms hair tapa wool Figure 1: words in WordNet covered by the pattern fabric/covering We have restricted our experiments to cases where the related meanings are of the same syntactic class (nouns).

The semantic relation that is captured by metonymy is one of semantic contiguity, in the sense that in many cases there are systematic relations between metonymically related concepts that can be regarded as slots in conceptual frames (cf. Fillmore 1977). For example, in the sentence ‘The colonies revolted against the crown.’ crown is used as a symbol for the monarchy as well as denoting the traditional head ornament worn by the monarch. As the example above shows, polysemy is a common way in which metonymically related concepts manifest themselves in language. It is to be expected that any systematic semantic relations between concepts expressed by these sense distinctions are lexicalized, i.e. they are explicitly listed in dictionaries and independent of a pragmatic situation.

The quantity a kettle will hold His observation was that the pattern is observable in all languages, and can be considered cross-linguistic. This small study seems to indicate that the regular polysemic pattern extends over language family boundaries to such an extent that it almost seems universal. This could suggest that the pattern is rooted in general human conceptualisation, and reflects an important non-arbitrary semantic relation between concepts or objects in the world. Indeed, if we describe the relation between container and content in terms of Aristotle’s qualia structure (Pustejovsky 1995), we see that it is the function of a container to hold an object or substance (telic role) and that a container is normally brought into existence for this purpose. More small-scale studies like the ones described above have been performed, mostly relying on introspection and smallscale dictionary analysis. A limited number of patterns that are valid in more than one language have been identified such as container/content and producer/product (Peters 2000). With the availability of WordNet and EuroWordNet it has become possible to investigate the cross-linguistic nature of metonymy on a large</context>

Introduction Viewed traditionally, metonymy is a nonliteral figure of speech in which the name of one thing is substituted for that of another related to it. It has been described as a cognitive process in which one conceptual entity, the vehicle, provides mental access to another conceptual entity (Radden 1999).
