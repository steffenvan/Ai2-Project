Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99995">
With the increase in popularity of online re-
view sites comes a corresponding need for
tools capable of extracting the information
most important to the user from the plain text
data. Due to the diversity in products and ser-
vices being reviewed, supervised methods are
often not practical. We present an unsuper-
vised system for extracting aspects and deter-
mining sentiment in review text. The method
is simple and flexible with regard to domain
and language, and takes into account the in-
fluence of aspect on sentiment polarity, an is-
sue largely ignored in previous literature. We
demonstrate its effectiveness on both compo-
nent tasks, where it achieves similar results to
more complex semi-supervised methods that
are restricted by their reliance on manual an-
notation and extensive knowledge sources.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999968452830189">
Online review sites continue to grow in popularity as
more people seek the advice of fellow users regard-
ing services and products. Unfortunately, users are
often forced to wade through large quantities of writ-
ten data in order to find the information they want.
This has led to an increase in research in the areas
of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, with the
aim of providing systems that can automatically an-
alyze user reviews and extract the information most
relevant to the user.
One example of such an application is generat-
ing a summary of the important factors mentioned
in the reviews of a product (see Lerman et al. 2009).
Another application is comparing two similar prod-
ucts. In this case, it is important to present to the
user the aspects in which the products differ, rather
than just provide a general star rating. A third exam-
ple is systems for generating automatic recommen-
dations, based on similarity between products, user
reviews, and history of previous purchases. These
types of application require an underlying frame-
work to identify the important aspects of the prod-
uct (also known as features or attributes), and the
sentiment expressed by the review writer.
Unsupervised Methods are desirable for this task,
for two reasons. First, due to the wide range and va-
riety of products and services being reviewed, the
framework must be robust and easily transferable
between domains. The second reason is the nature of
the data. Online reviews are often short and unstruc-
tured, and may contain many spelling and gram-
matical errors, as well as slang or specialized jar-
gon. These factors often present a problem to meth-
ods relying exclusively on dictionaries, manually-
constructed knowledge resources, and gazetteers, as
they may miss out on an important aspect of the
product or an indicator of sentiment. Unsupervised
methods, on the other hand, are not influenced by
the lexical form, and can handle unknown words or
word-forms, provided they occur frequently enough.
This insures that any emergent topic that is salient in
the data will be addressed by the system.
In this paper, we present an unsupervised system
which addresses the core tasks necessary to enable
advanced applications to handle review data. We in-
troduce a local topic model, which works at the sen-
tence level and employs a small number of topics, to
automatically infer the aspects. For sentiment detec-
tion, we present a method for automatically deriving
an unsupervised seed set of positive and negative ad-
jectives that replaces the manually constructed ones
commonly used in the literature. Our approach is
specifically designed to take into account the inter-

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In
Sec. 2 we provide relevant background, and place
our method in the context of previous work in the
field. We describe the data we used in Sec. 3, and our
experiments on the aspect and sentiment-polarity
components in Sec. 4 and 5, respectively. We con-
clude in Sec. 6 with a discussion of our results and
findings and directions for future research.

2 Previous Approaches
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914139534884">
In this paper, we focus on the detection of two prin-
ciple elements in the review text: aspects and sen-
timent. In previous work these elements have been
treated, for the most part, as two separate tasks.
Aspect The earliest attempts at aspect detection
were based on the classic information extraction (IE)
approach of using frequently occurring noun phrases
(e.g., Hu and Liu 2004). Such approaches work well
in detecting aspects that are strongly associated with
a single noun, but are less useful when aspects en-
compass many low frequency terms (e.g., the food
aspect of restaurants, which involves many differ-
ent dishes), or are abstract (e.g. ambiance can be
described without using any concrete nouns at all).
Common solutions to this problem involve cluster-
ing with the help of knowledge-rich methods, in-
volving manually-constructed rules, semantic hier-
archies, or both (e.g., Popescu and Etzioni 2005,
Fahrni and Klenner 2008). Titov and McDonald
(2008b) underline the need for unsupervised meth-
ods for aspect detection. However, according to the
authors, existing topic models, such as standard La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003),
are not suited to the task of aspect detection in re-
views, because they tend to capture global topics
in the data, rather than rateable aspects pertinent
to the review. To address this problem, they con-
struct a multi-grain topic model (MG-LDA), which
attempts to capture two layers of topics - global and
local, where the local topics correspond to rateable
aspects. MG-LDA distinguishes tens of local top-
ics, but the many-to-one mapping between these and
rateable aspects is not explicit in the system. To re-
solve this issue, the authors extend their model in
Titov and McDonald (2008a) and attempt to infer
such a mapping with the help of aspect-specific rat-
ings provided along with the review text.
Sentiment Sentiment analysis has been the fo-
cus of much previous research. In this discussion,
we will only mention work directly related to our
own. For a comprehensive survey of the subject, the
reader is directed to Pang and Lee (2008).
Most previous approaches rely on a manually
constructed lexicon of terms which are strongly pos-
itive or negative regardless of context. This informa-
tion on its own is usually insufficient, due to lack
of coverage and the fact that sentiment is often ex-
pressed through words whose polarity is highly do-
main and context specific. If a sentiment lexicon is
available for one domain, domain adaptation can be
used, provided the domains are sufficiently similar
(Blitzer et al., 2007). Another common solution is
through bootstrapping - using a seed group of terms
with known polarity to infer the polarity of domain
specific terms (e.g., Fahrni and Klenner 2008; Jijk-
oun and Hofmann 2009). The most minimalist ex-
ample of this approach is Turney (2002), who used
only a single pair of adjectives (good and poor) to
determine the polarity of other terms through mu-
tual information. For Chinese, Zagibalov and Carroll
(2008) use a single seed word meaning good, and six
common indicators of negation in their bootstrap-
ping approach. Often, when using a context indepen-
dent seed, large amounts of domain-specific data are
required, in order to obtain sufficient co-occurrence
statistics. Commonly, web queries are used to obtain
such data.
Independently of any specific task, Hatzivas-
siloglou and McKeown (1997) present a completely
unsupervised method for determining the polarity of
adjectives in a large corpus. A graph is created, in
which adjectives are nodes, and edges between them
are weighted according to a (dis)similarity function
based primarily on whether the two adjectives oc-
curred in a conjunction or disjunction in the corpus.
A heuristic approach is then used to split the graph
in two. The group containing the adjectives with the
higher average frequency is labeled as positive, and
the other as negative.
Combined Approaches Aspects can influence
sentiment polarity within a single domain. For ex-
ample, in the restaurant domain, cheap is usually
positive when discussing food, but negative when
discussing the decor or ambiance. Many otherwise
neutral terms (e.g., warm, heavy, soft) acquire a sen-
timent polarity in the context of a specific aspect.

<bodyText confidence="0.999972595238095">
Recent work has addressed this interaction in differ-
ent ways. Mei et al. (2007) present a form of do-
main adaptation using an LDA model which treats
positive and negative sentiment as two additional
topics. Fahrni and Klenner (2008) directly address
the specificity of sentiment to the word it is modi-
fying. Aspects are defined by a manually specified
subset of the Wikipedia category hierarchy. For sen-
timent, the authors use a seed set of positive and
negative adjectives, and iteratively propagate sen-
timent polarity through conjunction relations (like
those used by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997,
above). Web queries are used to overcome the spar-
sity issue of these highly-specific patterns. In the IE
setting, Popescu and Etzioni (2005) extract frequent
terms, and cluster them into aspects. The sentiment
detection task is formulated as a Relaxation Label-
ing problem of finding the most likely sentiment la-
bels for opinion-bearing terms, while satisfying as
many local constraints as possible. The authors use
a variety of knowledge sources, web queries, and
hand crafted rules to detect relations between terms
(e.g., meronymy). These relations are used both for
the clustering, and as a basis for the constraints.
Our approach is designed to be as unsupervised
and knowledge-lean as possible, so as to make it
transferable across different types of products and
services, as well as across languages. Aspects are
determined via a local version of LDA, which oper-
ates on sentences, rather than documents, and em-
ploys a small number of topics that correspond di-
rectly to aspects. This approach overcomes the prob-
lems of frequent-term methods, as well as the issues
raised by Titov and McDonald (2008b). We use mor-
phological negation indicators to automatically cre-
ate a seed set of highly relevant positive and nega-
tive adjectives, which are guaranteed to be pertinent
to the aspect at hand. These automatically-derived
seed sets achieve comparable results to the use of
manual ones, and the work of Zagibalov and Car-
roll (2008) suggests that the use of negation can be
easily transfered to other languages.

ditionally, to demonstrate the domain independence
of our system, we collected 1086 reviews for four
leading netbook computers from Amazon.com.
For evaluation purposes, we used the annotated
dataset from Ganu et al. (2009), which is a sub-
set of 3,400 sentences from the Citysearch corpus.
These sentences were manually labeled for aspect
and sentiment. There were six manually defined as-
pect labels - Food &amp; Drink, Service, Price, Atmo-
sphere, Anecdotes and Miscellaneous. A sentence
could contain multiple aspects, but, for our evalua-
tion, we used only sentences with a single label. For
sentiment, each sentence was given a single value -
Positive, Negative, Neutral or Conflict (indicating a
mixture of positive and negative sentiment).
We were also provided with a seed set of 128 pos-
itive and 88 negative adjectives used by Fahrni and
Klenner (2008), which were specifically selected to
be domain and target independent.
For the purpose of the experiments presented
here, we focused on sentences containing noun-
adjective pairs. Such pairs are one of the most com-
mon way of expressing sentiment about an aspect
and allow us to capture the interaction between the
two.

<bodyText confidence="0.999881294117647">
In order to infer the salient aspects in the data, we
employed the following steps:
Local LDA We used a standard implementation2
of LDA. In order to prevent the inference of global
topics and direct the model towards rateable aspects
(see Sec. 2), we treated each sentence as a separate
document. The output of the model is a distribution
over inferred aspects for each sentence in the data.
The parameters we employed were standard, out-of-
the-box settings (a = 0.1,b = 0.1, 3000 iterations),
with no specific tuning to our data. We ran the algo-
rithm with the number of aspects ranging from 10 to
20, and employed a cluster validation scheme (see
below) to determine the optimal number.
Model Order The issue of model order, i.e., deter-
mining the correct number of clusters, is an impor-
tant element in unsupervised learning. A common

approach (Levine and Domany, 2001; Lange et al.,
2004; Niu et al., 2007) is to use a cluster validation
procedure. In such a procedure, different model or-
ders are compared, and the one with the most con-
sistent clustering is chosen. For the purpose of the
validation procedure, we have a cluster correspond-
ing to each aspect, and we label each sentence as
belonging to the cluster of the most probable aspect.
Given the collection of sentences in our data, D,
and two connectivity matrices C and ˆC, where a cell
i, j contains 1 if sentences di and dj belong to the
same cluster, we define a consistency function F
(following Niu et al. 2007):

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.944464">
We then employ the following procedure:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998876">
1. Run the LDA model with k topics on D to ob-
tain connectivity matrix Ck.
2. Create a comparison connectivity matrix Rk

3. Sample random subset Di of size S|D |from D.
4. Run the LDA model on Di to obtain connectiv-
ity matrix Cik.
5. Create a comparison matrix Rik based on uni-
formly drawn random assignments of the in-
stances in Di.
6. Calculate scorei(k) = F(ˆC,C)−F( ˆR,R) where
F is given in Eq. 1.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 q times.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983361666666667">
8. Return the average score over q iterations.
This procedure calculates the consistency of our
clustering solution, using a similar sized random as-
signment for comparison. It does this on q subsets to
reduce the effects of chance. The k with the high-
est score is chosen. In our experiments, we used
q = 5,S = 0.9. For both our datasets (restaurants and
netbooks), the highest-scoring k was 14.
Determining Representative Words For each as-
pect, we list all the nouns in the data according to a
score based on their mutual information with regard
to that aspect.

Where p(w), p(a), p(w,a) are the probabilities, ac-
cording to the LDA model, of the word w, the aspect
a, and the word w labeled with aspect a, respectively.
We then select, for each aspect, the top ka rank-
ing words, such that they cover 75% of the word-
instances labeled by the LDA model with aspect la-
bel a. Due to the skewed frequency distribution of
words, this is a relatively small portion of the words
(typically 100-200). This set of representative words
for each aspect is used in the sentiment component
of our system (see Sec. 5.1).

<bodyText confidence="0.999985391304348">
Table 1 presents the aspects inferred by our system
for the restaurant domain. The inferred aspects cover
all those defined in the manual annotation, but also
distinguish between a finer granularity of aspects,
based solely on the review text, e.g., between phys-
ical environment and ambiance, and between the at-
titude of the staff and the quality of the service.
In order to demonstrate that our method can be
transfered between very different domains and cat-
egories of products, we also ran our algorithm on
our set of netbook reviews. The inferred aspects
are presented in Table 2. The system identifies im-
portant aspects relevant to our data. Some of these
(e.g., software, hardware) might be suggested by hu-
man annotators, but some would probably be missed
unless the annotators carefully read through all the
reviews, e.g., the Memory aspect, which includes ad-
vice about upgrading specific models. This capabil-
ity of our system is important, as it demonstrates that
our method can be used to produce customized com-
parisons for the user and will take into account the
important common factors, as well as the unique as-
pects of each item.

Figure 13. Although the data used in Titov and Mc-
Donald (2008a) was unavailable for direct compar-
ison, our method exhibits similar behavior and per-
formance (compare Fig. 4, there) on a domain with
similar characteristics (abstract aspects which en-
compass many low frequency words). This demon-
strates that our local version of LDA with few top-
ics overcomes the issues which confronted the au-
thors of that work (i.e., global topics and many-to-
one mapping of topics to aspects), without requiring
specially designed models or additional information
in the form of user-provided aspect-specific ratings
(see Sec. 2).
We believe the reason for this stems from the
composition of online reviews. Since many reviews
have similar mixtures of local topics (e.g., food, ser-
vice), standard LDA prefers global topics, which

sine type, restaurant type). However, when em-
ployed at the sentence level, local topics (corre-
sponding to rateable aspects) provide a stronger way
to distinguish between individual sentences.

For determining sentiment polarity, we developed
the following procedure. For each aspect, we ex-
tracted the relevant adjectives, built a conjunction
graph, automatically determined the seed set (or
used a manual one, for comparison), and propagated
the polarity scores to the rest of the adjectives. De-
tails of each step are described below.
Extracting Adjectives As a pre-processing step,
we parsed our data (using RASP, Briscoe and Car-
roll 2002). The parsed output was used to detect
negation and conjunction. If an adjective A partic-

ipated in a negation in the sentence, it was replaced
by a new adjective not-A. We then extract all cases
where an adjective modified a noun. For example,
from the sentence “The food was tasty and hot, but
our waiter was not friendly.” we can extract the pairs
(tasty, food), (hot, food), (not-friendly, waiter).
Building the Graph Our method for determin-
ing sentiment polarity is based on an adaptation of
Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) (see Sec. 2).
Several issues confronted us when attempting to
adapt their method to our task. In the original arti-
cle, adjectives with no orientation were ignored. It
is unclear how this can be easily done in an unsu-
pervised fashion, and such sentiment-neutral adjec-
tives are ubiquitous in real-world data. Furthermore,
adjectives whose orientation depended on the con-
text were also ignored. These are of particular in-
terest in our task, and are likely to be missing or
incorrectly labeled in standard sentiment dictionar-
ies. For our purposes, since we need to handle ad-
jectives expressing various shades of sentiment, not
only strongly positive or negative ones, we are inter-
ested in a scoring method, rather than a binary label-
ing. Also, we do not want to use a general corpus,
but rather the text from the reviews themselves. This
usually means a much smaller corpus than the one
used in the original paper, but has the advantage of
being domain specific.
Our method of building the polarity graph differed
in several ways from the original. First, we did not
use disjunctions (e.g., ‘but’) as indicators of opposite
polarity. The reason for this was that, in our domain
of online reviews, disjunctions often did not convey
contrast in polarity, but rather in perceived expecta-
tions, e.g., “dainty but strong necklace”, and “cheap
but delicious food”.
Instead of using regular expressions to capture ex-
plicit conjunctions, we retrieved all cases where our
parser indicated that two adjectives modified a sin-
gle noun in the same sentence.
To ensure that aspect-specific adjectives are han-
dled correctly, we built a separate graph for each as-
pect, by selecting the cases where the modified noun
was one of the representative words for that aspect
(see Sec. 4.1).
Constructing a Seed Set We used morphologi-
cal information and explicit negation to find pairs of
opposite polarity. Specifically, adjective pairs which
were distinguished only by one of the prefixes ‘un’,
‘in’, ‘dis’, ‘non’, or by the negation marker ‘not-’
were selected for the seed set. Starting with the most
frequent pair, we assigned a positive polarity to the
more frequent member of the pair.
Then, in order of decreasing frequency, we as-
signed polarity to the other seed pairs, based on the
shortest path either of the members had to a previ-
ously labeled adjective. That member received its
neighbor’s polarity, and the other member of the pair
received the opposite polarity. When all pairs were
labeled, we corrected for misclassifications by iter-
ating through the pairs and reversing the polarity if
that improved consistency, i.e., if it caused the mem-
bers of the pair to match the polarities of more of
their neighbors. Finally, we reverse the polarity of
the seed groups if the negative group has a higher
total frequency.
Propagating Polarity Our propagation method is
based on the label propagation algorithm of Zhu
and Ghahramani (2002). The adjectives in the posi-
tive and negative seed groups are assigned a polarity

score of 1 and 0, respectively. All the rest start with
a score of 0.5. Then, an update step is repeated. In
update iteration t, for each adjective x that is not in
the seed, the following update rule is applied:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998144">
Y-y�N(x)w(y,x)� pt−1(y)
pt(x) � (3)
Y-yEN(x)w(y,x)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998368833333333">
Where pt(x) is the polarity of adjective x at step t,
N(x) is the set of the neighbors of x, and w(y,x) is the
weight of the edge connecting x and y. We set this
weight to be 1 + log(#mod(y,x)) where #mod(y,x)
is the number of times y and x both modified a single
noun. The update step is repeated to convergence.

To evaluate the performance of the sentiment com-
ponent of our system, we created an aspect-specific
gold standard. For each of the top eight automati-
cally inferred aspects (corresponding to the Food,
Service and Atmosphere aspects in the annotation),
we constructed a polarity graph, as described in
Sec. 5.1. We retrieved a list of all adjectives that
participated in five or more modifications of nouns
from that specific aspect). Table 3 lists the number of
such adjectives in each aspect. We split the data into
ten portions and, for each portion, asked two volun-
teers to rate each adjective according to the polar-
ity of the sentiment it expresses in the context of the
specified aspect. The judges could select from the
following ratings: Strongly Negative, Weakly Nega-
tive, Neutral, Weakly Positive, Strongly Positive, and
N/A. As expected, exact inter-annotator agreement
was low - only 54%, but when considering two ad-
jacent ratings as equivalent (i.e, Strongly vs. Weakly
Negative or Positive, and Neutral vs. Weakly Neg-
ative or Positive), agreement was 93.3%. This indi-
cates there is some difficulty distinguishing between
the fine-grained categories we specified, but high
agreement at a coarser level, which advocates us-
ing a ranking approach for evaluation (see also Pang
and Lee 2005). We therefore translated the annota-
tor ratings to a numerical scale, from −2 (Strongly
Negative) to +2 (Strongly Positive) at unit intervals.
After discarding adjectives where one or more anno-
tators gave a ‘N/A’ tag, we averaged the two annota-
tor numerical scores, and used this data as the gold
standard for our evaluation.

Kendall’s tau coefficient (tik) and Kendall’s distance
(Dk) are commonly used (e.g., Jijkoun and Hofmann
2009) to compare rankings. These measures look at
the number of pairs of ranked items that agree or
disagree with the ordering in the gold standard. The
value of tik ranges from -1 (perfect disagreement) to
1 (perfect agreement), with 0 indicating an almost
random ranking. The value of Dk ranges from 0 (per-
fect agreement) to 1 (perfect disagreement). It is im-
portant to note that only pairs that are ordered in the
gold standard are used in the comparison.

(2008). Using the manual seed set obtains results
that correspond better to our gold standard. Our au-
tomatic method also achieves good results, and can
be used when a manual seed set is not available.
More importantly, correlation with the gold standard
may not indicate better suitability to the sentiment
detection task in reviews. For instance, it is interest-
ing to note that the worst correlation scores were on
the Main Dishes and Food - General aspects. If we
compare to Table 3, we can see these aspects have
the highest percentage of adjectives rated as neutral
by the annotators. However, in many cases, these ad-
jectives actually carry some sentiment in their con-
text. An example of this are adjectives describing
the type of cuisine, which are objective, and there-
fore usually considered neutral by annotators. Ta-
ble 5 shows the automatic ranking of cuisine type
from positive to negative in three aspects. It is inter-
esting to see that the rankings change according to
the aspect, and certain cuisines are strongly associ-
ated with specific aspects and not with others. This
is supported by Ganu et al. (2009), who observed
during the annotation that, in the restaurant corpus,
French and Italian restaurants were strongly associ-
ated with the service aspect. This trend can be iden-
tified automatically by our method, and at a much
more detailed level than that noticed by a human an-
alyzing the data.

6 Discussion &amp; Future Work

<bodyText confidence="0.999971022727273">
Our experiments confirm the value of a fully un-
supervised approach to the tasks of aspect detec-
tion and sentiment analysis. The aspects are inferred
from the data, and are more representative than
manually derived ones. For instance, in our restau-
rant domain, the manually constructed aspect list
omitted or over-generalized some important aspects,
while over-representing others. There was no sep-
arate Drinks category, even though it was strongly
present in the data. The Service aspect, dealing with
waiting time, reservations, and mistaken orders, was
an important emergent aspect on its own, but was
grouped under Staff in the manual annotation.
Adjectives can convey different sentiments de-
pending on the aspect being discussed. For exam-
ple, the adjective ‘warm’ was ranked very positive in
the Staff aspect, but slightly negative in the General
Food aspect. A knowledge-rich approach might ig-
nore such adjectives, thereby missing important ele-
ments of the review.
Finally, as online reviews belong to an informal
genre, with inventive spelling and specialized jar-
gon, it may be insufficient, for both aspect and
sentiment, to rely only on lexicons. For example,
our restaurant reviews included spelling errors such
as desert, decour/decore, anti-pasta, creme-brule,
sandwhich, omlette, exelent, tastey, as well as at
least six different common misspellings of restau-
rant. There were also specialized terms, such as Ko-
rma, Edamame, Dosa and Pho, all of which do not
appear in common dictionaries, and creative use of
adjectives, such as orgasmic and New-Yorky.
This work has opened many avenues for future re-
search and improvements. So far, we focused on ad-
jectives as sentiment indicators, however, there have
been studies showing that other parts of speech can
be very helpful for this task (e.g., Pang et al. 2002;
Benamara et al. 2007). Also, it would be interesting
to take a closer look at the interactions between as-
pect and sentiment, especially at a multiple-sentence
level (see Snyder and Barzilay 2007). Finally, we
feel that the true test of the usability of our system
should be through an application, and intend to pro-
ceed in that direction.

<abstract confidence="0.998291157894737">With the increase in popularity of online review sites comes a corresponding need for tools capable of extracting the information most important to the user from the plain text data. Due to the diversity in products and services being reviewed, supervised methods are often not practical. We present an unsupervised system for extracting aspects and determining sentiment in review text. The method is simple and flexible with regard to domain and language, and takes into account the influence of aspect on sentiment polarity, an issue largely ignored in previous literature. We demonstrate its effectiveness on both component tasks, where it achieves similar results to more complex semi-supervised methods that are restricted by their reliance on manual annotation and extensive knowledge sources.</abstract>
