This paper reports on completed work carried
out in the framework of the INTERA project,
and specifically, on the production of
multilingual resources (LRs) for eContent
purposes. The paper presents the methodology
adopted for the development of the corpus
(acquisition and processing of the textual
data), discusses the divergence of the initial
assumptions from the actual situation met
during this procedure, and concludes with a

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.997734272727273">
INTERA (Integrated European language data
Repository Area, Contract 22076Y2C2DMAL2) is
an EU-funded project within the eContent
framework, aiming at
■ building an integrated European Language
Resources (LRs) area by connecting existing
data centers at regional, national and
international level, and
■ at proposing &amp;quot;ways and techniques for LRs
packaging to make it a profitable and attractive
task to eContent professionals&amp;quot;; as an
application of this task, the production of
multilingual resources, namely parallel corpora
and multilingual terminologies extracted from
these, is undertaken (INTERA Technical
Annex).
This paper focuses on the second aim of the
project, presenting the work carried out in the area
of parallel corpus production, identifying the steps
followed in this process, in order to point out the
problematic areas involved in the task and suggest
ways of encompassing them.

2 Methodology and specifications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999789652173913">
The process usually followed in the LRs
production involves the following tasks: (a)
identification of user needs and requirements, (b)
specifications for the selection, construction and
packaging of the LRs, (c) identification of potential
sources, (d) construction of the LRs per se, (e)
promotion and distribution of the LRs.
Given that INTERA is an eContent project, the
target user group defined by the Technical Annex
of the project was eContent professionals and
users; furthermore, it was decided that the LRs to
be produced (which would be of interest to this
group) would be parallel corpora and multilingual
terminological lists. Finally, the most important
objective of the LRs production was the definition
of a business model which would be attractive to
the abovementioned target group.
The following sections discuss the actual steps
taken for the implementation of these
requirements.
The target group of eContent players addressed
by the project has been further defined as
consisting of professionals involved with the:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9897725">
• production of digital content (authors or
publishers)
• Globalization, Internationalization, Localiz-
ation and Translation (GILT) processes, and
• development of Human Language
Technology (HLT) software, ranging from
multilingual information retrieval and
extraction tools, to content management and
Computer-Assisted Translation or Machine
Translation solutions.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9723175">
The next step concerned the identification of
user needs and requirements on the basis of the
professionals’ working habits and processes. This
was achieved by exploiting the results of a number
of previous initiatives to roadmap the state-of-the-
art in multilingual LRs, in combination with new
initiatives undertaken in the framework of the
project and targeted to the eContent world.
The surveys conducted in the framework of the
ENABLER project (Maegaard et al. 2003,
Gavrilidou &amp; Desipri 2003) provided insights as to
the existence and availability of different types of
LRs, language demand, domains of interest,
standards, etc. Although ENABLER focused on
the LRs developer’s point of view, a number of
valuable results were elicited. Other surveys, such
as those conducted by ELRA and its distribution
agency ELDA aiming at determining the needs of
users with respect to available and potentially
available LRs (http://www.elra.info/), or surveys
available over the Internet through the sites of
international organizations such as LISA and IDC
or consultancy firms (http://www.globalsight.com,
LISA 2001, LISA/AIIM 2001, LISA/OSCAR
2003) shed a light as to the availability of
resources and relevant tools.
The information elicited from these surveys was
coupled by a study of the activities of the eContent
professionals as regards LRs, conducted in the
framework of INTERA (Gavrilidou et al, 2004)
through the circulation of a questionnaire
distributed to potential users, as well as through
personal contacts with a number of actors in the
relevant fields. The main areas of the study
concerned the types of LRs the eContent
professionals are interested in, domains and
languages of interest, and, most important, policies
concerning the way they acquire, use and exploit
LRs and tools.
The study of the target group yielded the
following specifications:
■ domains: it is obvious that eContent users are
more interested in specialized domains than in
general language resources; moreover, the
survey results showed health/medicine,
tourism, education, law, automotive industry
and IT/telecommunications, as being the
prevailing ones. In the framework of the
INTERA project, however, we decided to
focus on the prevailing domains as long as
they promote multilingual and multicultural
content. The selected domains are: health,
tourism, education and law, which correspond
to the predominant digital activities, namely,
eTourism, eHealth, eLearning, eGovernment
and eCommerce.
■ languages: the focus of eContent and the needs
of the users pointed towards the less widely
spoken languages, including Balkan and
Central and Eastern European languages (i.e
the languages of the new EU countries).
The project aims at the construction of a
multilingual parallel corpus of 12 million
words in total. The ideal scenario for the
intended application of term extraction would
be that of having a corpus with a source or
pivot language and translations of the same
texts in a number of target languages;
however, given that the project aims at
proposing realistic solutions to be adopted in
the future by prospective LRs creators, real-life
drawbacks should be taken into account;
therefore, the limitations in the availability of
existing resources (see section 3.1) dictated the
decision to collect resources for four pairs of
languages: Greek-English, Bulgarian-English,
Slovene-English and Serbian-English.
The specifications for the processing of the
corpus have been based on the requirements of its
intended application, which is the extraction of
terminology, and involve the following tasks:
■ alignment of the texts: for the specific
application purposes, alignment at sentence
level has been deemed sufficient; however, the
quality of the output is considered crucial;
therefore, automatic processing is followed by
human validation by language experts;
■ external and internal structural annotation: the
minimal requirements include segmentation at
sentence level for the alignment task and
metadata information that will be required for
the distribution and re-use of the corpus;
■ linguistic processing: below-Part of Speech
(PoS) tagging and lemmatization is the
minimum information required for the
automatic term extraction task.
To ensure re-usability of the collected and
processed material, compliance with the following
internationally accredited standards was decided:
■ the aligned material conforms to the TMX
standard (Translation Memory eXchange,
http://www.lisa.org/tmx/), which is XML-
compliant. Being a vendor-neutral, open
standard for storing and exchanging translation
memories created by Computer Aided
Translation (CAT) and localization tools,
TMX standard was identified as a requirement
for the eContent professionals. It allows easier
exchange of translation memory data between
tools and/or translation vendors with little or
no loss of critical data during the process;
■ for the external annotation, the IMDI metadata
schema (IMDI, Metadata Elements for Session
Descriptions, Version 3.0.4, Sept. 2003,
http://www.mpi.nl/world/ISLE/schemas/schem
as frame.html) has been selected; the internal
structural annotation adheres to the XCES
standard, i.e. the XML version of the Corpus
Encoding Standard (XCES,
http://www.cs.vassar.edu/XCES/ and CES,
http://www.cs.vassar.edu/CES/CES1-0.html).
■ the linguistic annotation of the texts also
adheres to the XCES standard, which
incorporates the EAGLES guidelines for
morphosyntactic annotation
(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/home.html).

3.1 Text collection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958162162163">
In order to construct the parallel corpus, the first
step consisted in the identification of potential
sources, i.e. existing parallel corpora and,
alternatively or additionally, textual material that
could be used for the creation from scratch of the
INTERA corpus.
Previous surveys (see section 2) that identify
existing LRs as well as a search over the Internet
attested the scarcity of available resources in the
selected languages and domains, and so, the idea of
re-using existing corpora was abandoned in favour
of the construction of a new corpus from scratch.
The identification process of potential sources
had to take into consideration the following
requirements:
■ to obtain texts from a variety of sources of
interest to the eContent society,
■ to ensure that the material was free of
Intellectual Property Rights problems, either
through the arrangement of specific
agreements or by obtaining them from public
sources.
The ideal candidates, in this respect, mainly
consist of texts available over the Internet,
provided by organizations/institutions that wish to
make their own material available in more than one
language, such as international organizations (e.g.
United Nations, European Union, World Health
Organization, Non-Governmental Organizations,
etc.), multinational companies, companies with
activities outside their own country (e.g. data
describing company profiles &amp; activities, product
catalogues, etc.), public administration services
(e.g. regarding bilateral agreements, regulations for
immigrants, etc.), news agencies (targeting
international broadcasting or for foreign language
audience within their own country), official
national government sites, national tourism
organizations, etc. In all the above cases, the
material consists of either web content per se (i.e.
mainly bilingual web sites, rarely trilingual or
quadrilingual) or of texts (official documents,
technical reports, etc.) included in the web sites.
A more careful investigation, however, of web
texts showed that although Internet is rapidly
becoming multilingual, it is not yet parallel,
especially as regards the languages involved in the
project: most international bodies include original
and translated texts but only in the more widely
spoken languages. Moreover, a closer inspection of
web texts that &amp;quot;seem&amp;quot; parallel, on the basis of
structural similarities (e.g. similar size, paragraph
segmentation, possible &amp;quot;anchors&amp;quot;, such as list
enumerators, etc.) showed that only sporadic parts
of them were parallel. More problems arise from
the fact that texts may contain large parts of
foreign language material (e.g. EU regulations that
include amendments to previous regulations by
including the replacement text of specific
paragraphs in all EU languages).
Given the above observations, cooperation with
other data centers, with proven expertise in the
area of LRs production for the specific project
languages was sought; this would ensure content
quality of the corpus, both during the selection (i.e.
native speakers are better qualified to recognize
true parallel material) and the encoding and
validation processes, especially as regards the
alignment validation and the linguistic processing.
ILSP remains responsible for the construction of
the Greek-English corpus, the collection and
harmonization of the four subcorpora, the
linguistic processing of the English texts and the
addition of the IMDI metadata.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999808">
3.2 Text processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.904365555555555">
Depending on the source that provided the
original material (e.g. web site content, publishing
house, translation company, etc.), different
processing was required in order to arrive at the
desired format adhering to the specifications set by
the INTERA project; such as, indicatively:
■ conversion of the original PDF/RTF/HTML
etc. files into the format required by the
various tools (tokenizer, aligner, tagger),
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.681727">
■ cleanup of the texts from unwanted material
(e.g. tables, figures, foreign language material,
etc.)
■ re-structuring of the original monolingual texts
from the TMX file, when the source was the
output of a Translation Memory,
■ manual or semi-automatic annotation of
metadata.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966896551724">
Each language team undertook the processing of
the collected material (i.e. alignment and human
validation, structural and linguistic annotation
without human validation), using their own tools,
thus ensuring that no time is lost over training with
new tools and that the required language-
dependent tools (especially taggers) used in the
project are the most appropriate ones. The material
to be delivered, however, at the end of all
processes must be conformant to the selected
standards.
The intervention of ILSP takes place only at the
end of this process, with the purpose of validating
the conformance of the results and of harmonizing
any problematic issues. The most important point
of this process is the linguistic annotation and,
specifically, the harmonization of the different
tagsets used. In conformance with the
methodology adopted in the project, i.e. of re-using
existing material, whenever possible, with the least
possible interventions, so as to ensure time and
cost efficiency, it was decided to re-use only
existing tools for each language, without making
any modifications to the tools themselves but only
conversion(s) of their output. Therefore, the task of
harmonizing the output with regard to the
morphosyntactic tags employed by each tagger is
the last stage of the procedure, where all tagsets are
mapped to one, based on the EAGLES guidelines.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999827695652174">
In this paper, we described the methodology
followed in the construction of a multilingual
parallel corpus; this task has been interpreted as a
test application endeavor in the process of defining
a business model for the LRs production. The
effort was to identify gaps and shortcomings in the
process usually employed by LRs producers (or
users who might wish to create their own LRs) and
to suggest ways of remedying them. Our findings
include:
■ problems faced during the acquisition phase:
although an increasing supply of raw data (e.g.
over Internet) and tools capable of exploiting
this data (e.g. web crawlers that can identify
and download texts in a given language) is
attested, there is also a need for the
enhancement of these tools with more
intelligent techniques (e.g. incorporation of
alignment techniques during the acquisition
process in order to spot potential parallel texts,
identification and mark-up of large foreign
language excerpts),
■ problems faced during the processing phase:
in order to enhance the LRs production effort,
the re-use of existing tools is considered
crucial. It is true that an increasing number of
tools are available for text processing;
however, this is oriented mainly towards the
major languages. Moreover, information
concerning the existence, availability and
operation of existing tools is not easy to locate
– a gap that the other pillar of INTERA tries to
remedy through the building of an integrated
European Language Resources area.
Additionally, tools must be enhanced with
respect to two directions: improvement of the
tools themselves (e.g. more robust alignment
techniques) and interoperability of all relevant
tools currently used at different phases of
processing. The issue of interoperability is
closely related with the issue of standards. The
promotion and deployment of existing
standards as well as the creation of new
standards, when these are lacking, is important
to ensure viability and re-use of LRs, given the
cost of their production.
