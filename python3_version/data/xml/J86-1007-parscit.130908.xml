THE FINITE STRING NEWSLETTER
BERNARD VAUQUOIS
PIONEER OF MACHINE TRANSLATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999342585106383">
[died September 30, 1985, at the age of 56]
It has not been long since Bernard Vauquois has left us,
but we already deeply feel the magnitude of our loss.
The father of seven, he was the founder of GETA
(Groupe d&apos;Etudes pour la Traduction Automatique), one
of the initiators of EUROTRA, and one of the key figures
in natural language processing in the world.
Having earned a State Doctorate in astronomy in
1958, he then turned logician, and became interested in
the theory and practice of formal and natural languages,
where he demonstrated his far-sightedness and sharpness
of mind over the years.
At 31, in 1960, he was appointed Professor of
Computer Science at Grenoble University. With Profes-
sor J. Kuntzman and N. Gastinel, he started computer
science activities there. At that time, he was also work-
ing on the definition of ALGOL-60.
In 1960 also, he founded CETA (Centre d&apos;Etude pour
la Traduction Automatique, later GETA), and soon
showed his gift for quick understanding, synthesis and
innovation, as well as his taste for personal communi-
cation across borders and language barriers.
After having visited a number of centers, mainly in the
United States, where research in MT was being
conducted, he analyzed the defects of the &amp;quot;first
generation&amp;quot; approach, assessed the potential of the new,
grammar-based methods of formal language theory, and
proposed a new approach, based on a &amp;quot;pivot&amp;quot; represen-
tation, and on the use of (declarative) rule systems to
transform a sentence sequentially from one level of
representation to the other. He led the CETA into
constructing the first large-scale second generation
system, applied to Russian-French, from 1962 to 1971.
By the end of this period, the accumulated experience
led him to pin-point some defects of the &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; declar-
ative and interlingual approach, and to use heuristic
programming techniques, implemented as procedural
grammars written in SLLPs (Specialized Languages for
Linguistic Programming), such as ATEF, ROBRA,
TRANSF and SYGMOR, which were developed under his
guidance, and integrated in the first (and still unique)
programming environment for building and using multi-
lingual M(A)T systems (ARIANE-78).
It seems that, each time he initiated a new project, he
also created some new and useful concept. In 1974, at
the time when he co-founded the LEIBNIZ group, he
proposed his now famous &amp;quot;multilevel structural
descriptors&amp;quot; for translation units larger than sentences.
This idea, premonitory of later theoretical work (Jacken-
doff, Gazdar) is still the cornerstone of all MT lingwares
built by GETA and by the French National MT project.
It has also been a fruitful source of inspiration for
EUROTRA, which uses it in a simplified form for the
Interface Structures.
Bernard Vauquois&apos;s last contribution was the
invention of the &amp;quot;static grammar&amp;quot; concept, in 1982-83,
during the ESOPE project, a preparatory phase of the
French National MT project. A SCSG (Structural Corre-
spondence Static Grammar) specifies the correspondence
between a family of strings (of word-trees), the language,
and a family of decorated trees, the structural descrip-
tors. Two such SCSGs, for French and English, have
been developed under his supervision in the framework
of the French National MT project, and have been used
to construct &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; (procedural) grammars for analy-
sis and synthesis.
Early Eurotrians will certainly remember his energy
and enthusiasm, which he repeatedly displayed during the
years when EUROTRA was being designed. It so
happened that the French National MT project, started
earlier than EUROTRA, required most of his attention
from 1981-82 onwards.
He was certainly a key figure in computational linguis-
tics, not only in France and in Europe, but also around
the world. From 1969 to 1984, he was chairman of the
ICCL (International Committee on Computational
Linguistics), which organizes the COLING conferences.
In France, he frequently cooperated with other coun-
tries (most notably Canada, USA, USSR, Czechoslovakia,
Japan, China, Brazil, Malaysia, and Thailand), often
working himself on specification and implementation of
grammars and dictionaries. For example, he began coop-
eration with Malaysia in 1979, which led to the creation
of the Projete Terjemaan Automatic, with a first Engl-
ish-Malay prototype, already demonstrable by 1980.
This project is now autonomous, with a staff of six full-
time researchers.
For his friends and close colleagues, however, he was
not only a very gifted scientist, a remarkable teacher, and
a &amp;quot;father figure&amp;quot; but also a very intense human being,
enjoying life, energetic, courteous, charming and very
witty.
He will be sorely missed, not only in Grenoble, but
also in Europe and all around the world.

My remaining memory of Bernard Vauquois will be his
tall, sloping figure jumping up after a talk, his face eager
and already grinning at his joke to come, the shoulders
shaking a little with anticipation. The last example he
pressed on me in this way, after some dull talk on
PP-attachment, was &amp;quot;Pate de canard truffe&amp;quot;; where it
Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 1, January-March 1986 43
The FINITE STRING Newsletter Bernard Vauquois
was, he insisted, the pate not the canard that was
&amp;quot;truffe&amp;quot;. It was just the kind of example he loved,
French in content as well as form, and extending what
the speaker had said to a different area. I crossed swords
with him many times, on intellectual and political issues,
but he never allowed what he ought to say, to preserve
his institute or country&apos;s interests, to interfere with what
his intellectual honesty actually said. He was one of the
great intellectuals in MT, and I am very sad personally
that I shall not see those shoulders quivering with fun
again.

I believe that Bernard Vauquois was the first to give a
European dimension to the idea of machine translation.
He was the initiator of the Leibniz Group, an association
of European researchers who explored the possibility of
launching European co-operative projects. The Leibniz
Group eventually had to resign itself to the apathy of the
research authorities, but Bernard Vauquois pursued his
ideal — Don Quixotesque some believed — and convinced
Georges Anderla, Director of Information Management
at the CEC, that a European machine translation project
was a promising response to the challenge of multi-lingu-
al communication in the European Community. This was
the origin of EUROTRA. Bernard Vauquois took an
active part in its initial definition, and to the very end he
supported the project in his role as one of the French
members of its advisory committee. Bernard Vauquois&apos;s
contribution to EUROTRA was invaluable. His role was
first that of a teacher who shared liberally his rich experi-
ence with us, then as a counsellor and a source of ideas
and visions which have left an indelible imprint on our
project.

I first met Bernard Vauquois at the COLING he organ-
ized in Grenoble in 1967. Already on that occasion I
was impressed by those qualities that I was later to
admire even more: the depth, clearness and concreteness
of his scientific thought; his devotion to research; his love
and exquisite and aristocratic taste for language as both
an object of study and a means of expression; his sense
of humour — sometimes so simple as to be disarming —
and his delight in a witty remark, his desire for gaiety and
his thirst for novelty which would suddenly appear
together with the dignity, seriousness and even-minded-
ness of a person invested with great responsibilities. I
remember, with deep emotion, the love and pride with
which he would speak about his family and about their
&amp;quot;adventurous&amp;quot; journeys together. As vice-president of
the ICCL, I was particularly close to him for the last eight
years of his presidency. Now, together with Martin Kay,
who has succeeded him in that role, we are preparing a
volume of essays written by his friends in his honour.

I first met Bernard Vauquois in 1979 when, as a research
student, I was taken to Grenoble on an informal visit. I
was immediately struck by his personal charisma, as well
as by the strength of the group he had built up around
him. This snapshot view of the work of GETA served to
confirm my nascent commitment and addiction to
computational linguistics, and for a long time shaped my
view of how to conduct CL research. But above all,
Professor Vauquois was approachable: despite his many
commitments, he always had time to discuss, teach and
communicate his enthusiasm in that infectiously good-na-
tured manner that was for many his trademark, even to
the most junior of his associates.
Many have commented on his wonderful sense of
humour, and I would like to share my favourite memory
of this aspect of Bernard Vauquois. We had been
discussing the relative productivity of English and French
morphology, and the particular example of the term in
English for a male goat had caught his attention. With
that mischievous grin of his, he sought confirmation of a
generalisation — coining delightful zoological terms such
as &amp;quot;billy-sheep&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;billy-dog&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;billy-hippopotamus&amp;quot; and
so on. It was with great reluctance that we were unable
to confirm the data.

The name of Professor Vauquois has been known to us
since we became interested in computational linguistics,
and we have known him personally since 1978. We want
to use this sad opportunity to recall a visit which we
made to GETA in 1979. What we remember most from
this visit is the very personal interest Professor Vauquois
took in it. He spent a long time discussing with us, and
this meant very much to us, both personally and scientif-
ically. For all three of us, this visit created a personal
relationship that has lasted ever since. We will miss
Professor Vauquois.

At a panel discussion during COLING 84 at Stanford —
one of the ten successive biennial world-scale interna-
tional meetings on computational linguistics organized by
the International Committee of Computational Linguis-
tics, many under the chairmanship of Bernard Vauquois
— we were facing a suggestive question, &amp;quot;When is the
next ALPAC Report due?&amp;quot; With Bernard sitting in the
same room just a few rows before me, I did not hesitate
to take the more optimistic variant of the question,

asking &amp;quot;Whether&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;When,&amp;quot; and to believe
that if we beware of commercially attractive but scientif-

we stay on the ground and work rather than talk, as he
has always done with his group, we can answer that
question in negative. Alas! Bernard Vauquois is no
longer in the same room — and my self-confidence is
shaken.

After the rise of sceptical attitudes towards MT, not to
speak about other discouraging events, I had the extraor-
dinary luck to come to Grenoble in October 1968, having
been invited by the late Bernard Vauquois to work on his
MT project for a year. In CETA I found an atmosphere
of intensive co-operation of mathematicians with
linguists of various specializations and backgrounds,
including visitors from the U.S. and Japan, whose enthusi-
astic activities were initiated and united by Bernard&apos;s
leading personality. Bernard and his group, in spite of
the disintegrating tendencies at French universities of
that time, formulated and implemented the then most
complete and adequate MT system. The Praguean efforts
in MT, which had started, on a lesser scale, almost
contemporaneously with the Grenoble group, have been
highly reinforced by the regular contacts which started
then and were continued up to our last meeting in
November 1984. Bernard&apos;s energy, high requirements
and friendly attitude towards international cooperation
on an appropriate scientific level will be badly missed by
the world&apos;s MT enterprises.

Professor Vauquois was impressive both intellectually
and physically. I can date my first encounter with him
fairly precisely, because immediately afterwards I circu-
lated an in-house paper at CETADOL in Montreal (the
forerunner of TAUM) on how the Grenoble Russian-
French MT model could be applied to our English-French
research. Everyone who knew Vauquois remembers him
drawing the U-shaped outline of that model on a black-
board somewhere; he took it round the world. His expo-
sition that day seduced me away from my muddling
native British pragmatism to the conceptual light and
power of algebraic modelling, and so I joined ranks with
several of my French Canadian colleagues who had been
Grenoble trained. That was in 1967 — nearly two
decades ago! Grenoble was already a great international
school.
But of course Bernard had his human side too. Much
of the warmth and some of the music will have gone out
of the high-ceilinged old apartment in the centre of
Grenoble. Likewise it is now nearly two decades since
the snowy winter when he crowded into half a cosy
Montreal duplex with cheerful Mme Vauquois and five (I
think) younger children. By that time or soon after
(1970), CETADOL had become TAUM and we had
begun to apply Colmerauer&apos;s Q-System. To show it off
to him, somebody arranged that he would type in
&amp;quot;Vauquois was met at the airport by Michel&amp;quot; (i.e.,
Michel van Canaghem, computer analyst and first Q-Sys-
tem French morphologist), whereupon our model-T
interactive terminal would chug back with &amp;quot;Michel a
rencontre Vauquois a l&apos;aeroport.&amp;quot; We waited for him to
admire the transformation. However, his only comment
was, &amp;quot;C&apos;est tres bien, mais puisque la rencontre etait
prevue, il aurait fallu traduire met par a accueilli.&amp;quot; I
thought to myself, &amp;quot;In matters of language he&apos;s an unre-
lenting Frenchman.&amp;quot; The impression was confirmed a
few years later when I heard him wince at the gross
anglicism &amp;quot;linguistique computationnelle&amp;quot;, which we had
coined in the organizing committee for COLING 76. On
the other hand, I never managed to persuade him that his
gallicism &amp;quot;automatic translation&apos; was an offence to
English.
Many will feel that Bernard Vauquois&apos;s death marks
the passing away of an epoch. Anyway, it makes me feel
nostalgic for myself and very sorry for his family. GETA,
and that model on the blackboard, are his monuments.

Bernard Vauquois had the distinction, in the field of
machine translation in Europe, of being a prime instiga-
tor, one who kept the discipline alive in its difficult days,
and one who took a large part in assisting its rebirth. His
gifts of sharp analysis, of clarity in exposition, of inven-
tiveness in finding solutions to technical problems made
him invaluable as a colleague and as a teacher. In writing
this, I wish to acknowledge a personal as well as a
communal debt. We shall remember him.

Bernard Vauquois obtained supplementary funds for the
1967 Grenoble COLING Conference by associating with
it the opening ceremonies for a new university building —
the first in the world, surely, to be dedicated to research
on machine translation. I was mighty impressed. I was
also impressed with his paternity. He told me that he had
as many children as French law would permit him to
drive without a chauffeur&apos;s license — and it was always
obvious that he loved every one of them dearly. And he
loved his work and his colleagues, who mourn him.

The tragic loss of Professor Bernard Vauquois had a
deep personal dimension for many computational
linguists in the Montreal area. Vauquois&apos;s encourage-

ment and leadership was an important factor in the
creation and early development of the TAUM translation
project at the Universite de Montréal in the late 1960&apos;s.
A visiting professor at the University in 1971-72, he
exerted a strong professional and human influence on
computer scientists and linguists alike. His personal
warmth and involvement remained an important element
in the exchanges between Montreal and Grenoble that
have flourished since that time. His constant devotion to
family, friends and colleagues will long be remembered.
The world community of computational linguists owes
a great deal of its cohesion and continued development to
the leadership of Bernard Vauquois. Throughout the last
two decades his role in ICCL&apos;s COLING conferences was
a crucial one. In the early 70s, when automatic trans-
lation activity was at a low ebb worldwide, he personally
guaranteed its survival through his leadership of GETA in
Grenoble, and by his tireless efforts to promote interna-
tional co-operation among active groups and individuals.
In recent years Vauquois was at the forefront of a partic-
ularly successful series of exchanges between GETA and
several research groups in Japan and Southeast Asia.
Probably no other individual has played such a decisive
role in the development of automatic translation as a
scientific domain.

We deeply regret the death of Professor Vauquois, who
has contributed so substantially to research and develop-
ment in machine translation throughout the world. We
treasure the most pleasant memories of him. He invited
many Japanese colleagues to GETA and contributed
actively to research on machine translation in Japan. We
are certain that his contribution to the study of machine
translation will never be forgotten.
I will always associate Professor Vauquois with the
beautiful scenery of Grenoble, where he invited me to
stay for a year during 1969-70. He was so kind to visit-
ing scholars, inviting them to his home, to go skiing, and
for automobile drives in the mountains. I had frequent
discussions with him about the methodology of machine
translation, and was always enlightened by him. Since
the stay in Grenoble, I met him often in Europe, the
United States, Canada, and several times recently in
Japan. Professor Vauquois was always enthusiastic
about the possibility for better machine translation. We
have to internalize his goals for high quality machine
translation systems and to actively work toward realizing
them in the near future. I have recently written a book
on machine translation in Japanese, which I dedicated to
the memory of Professor Vauquois.

Asked what attracted him to machine translation as a
field of research, Bernard Vauquois once stated: &amp;quot;You
get away from the et ceteras.&amp;quot; Linguistics like many
other disciplines abounds in et ceteras, where the author
claims a much wider scope for his observations than the
minuscule fragment he has actually investigated. Disap-
pointingly, mathematizing trends and computational
approaches seem to restrain such self-indulgence very
little. Bernard Vauquois did not grant himself such free-
dom; he was too serious a scholar to want to avoid diffi-
culties.
One problem engaged Bernard Vauquois and his team
of dedicated associates over a period, the length of which
is more naturally stated in terms of fractions of a century
than in numbers of years. When other efforts were,
sometimes for good reasons, discontinued, Bernard
Vauquois and his group built up a capital of trust that
they were marching towards a goal. Plus, of course, a
conviction with all those who learned to know Bernard
Vauquois personally, that the work was based on unvary-
ing intellectual honesty.
Long-range research programmes have to be defended
along two lines: they have to be protected from the tren-
dy &amp;quot;avant gardists&amp;quot; who keep recasting their tools every
second year to conform to the latest fashion; and they
must ward off &amp;quot;ad hocities&amp;quot;. It is a bitter reflection —
bitter to us observers for Bernard Vauquois was not
inclined to self-pity — that a first-rank scholar had to
spend time and energy in explaining the difference
between real research and the lowest-level quasi-practical
ad hocities — and had to do this not only to stray newspa-
per reporters but to the highest levels of national and
multi-national decision-makers.
Bernard Vauquois was not native to the domain of
linguistics. Nor, of course, to computer science; no one
of his generation could possibly be. It was a time of
migration, and one migration wave brought the astrono-
mer Vauquois to language studies. He brought with him
a sense for completeness and accuracy and is one of the
examples of how our field has profited from immigration.
But on a personal level, Bernard Vauquois was not a
migrant. He was unmistakably French and deeply rooted
in French culture. He considered the size of the list of
cheese in the local shop — 250, I think he told me — to be
as important as the storage capacity in his computer.
Speaking an English that was clearly continental, he
played a European role without disowning his Frenchness
and an international role without ceasing to sound Euro-
pean. It was, paradoxically, probably this very local root-
ing, plus the obviously good will and keen human interest
behind a shy smile, that made people in so many broader
circles — the common market, Eastern Europe, the Far
East, and the academic community at large — listen to his
low-keyed comments.

For the past 25 years, Bernard Vauquois headed a series
of machine translation projects at the University of
Grenoble in France that were distinguished by the
consistent exploration of sophisticated computational
linguistic techniques. A paper describing a significant
part of this work, entitled &amp;quot;Automated Translation at
Grenoble University&amp;quot; (co-authored with Christian
Boitet), appeared in the January-March 1985 issue of
Computational Linguistics [Volume 11, Number 1].
However, throughout his life he was a continuous source
of new ideas and new projects and a powerful presence
nationally and internationally in the field of machine
translation. That his influence was not just local is illus-
trated by the EUROTRA project, the inception of which
owes much to his efforts. Over the last five years he was
instrumental in establishing, in both Malaysia and Thai-
land, research groups that are developing machine trans-
lation systems for the indigenous languages. In fact, it
was in Penang that the leukemia, which claimed his life,
resulted in hospitalization. He was transferred to Paris
and seemed on the road to recovery when lung compli-
cations led to his death.
From 1969 to 1984 Professor Vauquois chaired the
International Committee on Computational Linguistics,
the organizing body for the COLING conferences. I first
met him at the 1967 Conference, not yet called COLING.
It was an exciting meeting, and a significant part of that
excitement was contributed by his enthusiasm and his
organizational skills. However, equally well conveyed
was his personal charm and his sense of humor.
Throughout his life, he used these traits, coupled of
course with his intellectual competence, in the service not
only of computational linguistics and machine translation,
but of scientific research more generally.

<abstract confidence="0.995441436170213">[died September 30, 1985, at the age of 56] It has not been long since Bernard Vauquois has left us, but we already deeply feel the magnitude of our loss. The father of seven, he was the founder of GETA (Groupe d&apos;Etudes pour la Traduction Automatique), one of the initiators of EUROTRA, and one of the key figures in natural language processing in the world. Having earned a State Doctorate in astronomy in 1958, he then turned logician, and became interested in the theory and practice of formal and natural languages, where he demonstrated his far-sightedness and sharpness of mind over the years. At 31, in 1960, he was appointed Professor of Computer Science at Grenoble University. With Professor J. Kuntzman and N. Gastinel, he started computer science activities there. At that time, he was also working on the definition of ALGOL-60. In 1960 also, he founded CETA (Centre d&apos;Etude pour la Traduction Automatique, later GETA), and soon showed his gift for quick understanding, synthesis and innovation, as well as his taste for personal communication across borders and language barriers. After having visited a number of centers, mainly in the United States, where research in MT was being conducted, he analyzed the defects of the &amp;quot;first generation&amp;quot; approach, assessed the potential of the new, grammar-based methods of formal language theory, and proposed a new approach, based on a &amp;quot;pivot&amp;quot; representation, and on the use of (declarative) rule systems to transform a sentence sequentially from one level of representation to the other. He led the CETA into constructing the first large-scale second generation system, applied to Russian-French, from 1962 to 1971. By the end of this period, the accumulated experience led him to pin-point some defects of the &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; declarative and interlingual approach, and to use heuristic programming techniques, implemented as procedural grammars written in SLLPs (Specialized Languages for Linguistic Programming), such as ATEF, ROBRA, TRANSF and SYGMOR, which were developed under his guidance, and integrated in the first (and still unique) programming environment for building and using multilingual M(A)T systems (ARIANE-78). It seems that, each time he initiated a new project, he also created some new and useful concept. In 1974, at the time when he co-founded the LEIBNIZ group, he proposed his now famous &amp;quot;multilevel structural descriptors&amp;quot; for translation units larger than sentences. This idea, premonitory of later theoretical work (Jackendoff, Gazdar) is still the cornerstone of all MT lingwares built by GETA and by the French National MT project. It has also been a fruitful source of inspiration for EUROTRA, which uses it in a simplified form for the Interface Structures. Bernard Vauquois&apos;s last contribution was the invention of the &amp;quot;static grammar&amp;quot; concept, in 1982-83, during the ESOPE project, a preparatory phase of the French National MT project. A SCSG (Structural Correspondence Static Grammar) specifies the correspondence between a family of strings (of word-trees), the language, and a family of decorated trees, the structural descriptors. Two such SCSGs, for French and English, have been developed under his supervision in the framework of the French National MT project, and have been used to construct &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; (procedural) grammars for analysis and synthesis. Early Eurotrians will certainly remember his energy and enthusiasm, which he repeatedly displayed during the years when EUROTRA was being designed. It so happened that the French National MT project, started earlier than EUROTRA, required most of his attention from 1981-82 onwards. He was certainly a key figure in computational linguistics, not only in France and in Europe, but also around the world. From 1969 to 1984, he was chairman of the ICCL (International Committee on Computational Linguistics), which organizes the COLING conferences. In France, he frequently cooperated with other countries (most notably Canada, USA, USSR, Czechoslovakia, Japan, China, Brazil, Malaysia, and Thailand), often working himself on specification and implementation of grammars and dictionaries. For example, he began cooperation with Malaysia in 1979, which led to the creation of the Projete Terjemaan Automatic, with a first English-Malay prototype, already demonstrable by 1980. This project is now autonomous, with a staff of six fulltime researchers. For his friends and close colleagues, however, he was not only a very gifted scientist, a remarkable teacher, and a &amp;quot;father figure&amp;quot; but also a very intense human being, enjoying life, energetic, courteous, charming and very witty. He will be sorely missed, not only in Grenoble, but also in Europe and all around the world.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.987572631578948">My remaining memory of Bernard Vauquois will be his tall, sloping figure jumping up after a talk, his face eager and already grinning at his joke to come, the shoulders shaking a little with anticipation. The last example he pressed on me in this way, after some dull talk on PP-attachment, was &amp;quot;Pate de canard truffe&amp;quot;; where it Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 1, January-March 1986 43 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Bernard Vauquois was, he insisted, the pate not the canard that was &amp;quot;truffe&amp;quot;. It was just the kind of example he loved, French in content as well as form, and extending what the speaker had said to a different area. I crossed swords with him many times, on intellectual and political issues, but he never allowed what he ought to say, to preserve his institute or country&apos;s interests, to interfere with what his intellectual honesty actually said. He was one of the great intellectuals in MT, and I am very sad personally that I shall not see those shoulders quivering with fun again.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.996656095238095">I believe that Bernard Vauquois was the first to give a European dimension to the idea of machine translation. He was the initiator of the Leibniz Group, an association of European researchers who explored the possibility of launching European co-operative projects. The Leibniz Group eventually had to resign itself to the apathy of the research authorities, but Bernard Vauquois pursued his ideal — Don Quixotesque some believed — and convinced Georges Anderla, Director of Information Management at the CEC, that a European machine translation project was a promising response to the challenge of multi-lingual communication in the European Community. This was origin of Vauquois took an active part in its initial definition, and to the very end he supported the project in his role as one of the French members of its advisory committee. Bernard Vauquois&apos;s to was His role was first that of a teacher who shared liberally his rich experience with us, then as a counsellor and a source of ideas and visions which have left an indelible imprint on our project.</abstract>

Already on that occasion I was impressed by those qualities that I was later to admire even more: the depth, clearness and concreteness of his scientific thought; his devotion to research; his love and exquisite and aristocratic taste for language as both an object of study and a means of expression; his sense of humour — sometimes so simple as to be disarming — and his delight in a witty remark, his desire for gaiety and his thirst for novelty which would suddenly appear together with the dignity, seriousness and even-mindedness of a person invested with great responsibilities. I remember, with deep emotion, the love and pride with which he would speak about his family and about their &amp;quot;adventurous&amp;quot; journeys together. As vice-president of the ICCL, I was particularly close to him for the last eight years of his presidency. Now, together with Martin Kay, who has succeeded him in that role, we are preparing a volume of essays written by his friends in his honour.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.997723583333333">I first met Bernard Vauquois in 1979 when, as a research student, I was taken to Grenoble on an informal visit. I was immediately struck by his personal charisma, as well as by the strength of the group he had built up around him. This snapshot view of the work of GETA served to confirm my nascent commitment and addiction to computational linguistics, and for a long time shaped my view of how to conduct CL research. But above all, Professor Vauquois was approachable: despite his many commitments, he always had time to discuss, teach and communicate his enthusiasm in that infectiously good-natured manner that was for many his trademark, even to the most junior of his associates. Many have commented on his wonderful sense of humour, and I would like to share my favourite memory of this aspect of Bernard Vauquois. We had been discussing the relative productivity of English and French morphology, and the particular example of the term in English for a male goat had caught his attention. With that mischievous grin of his, he sought confirmation of a generalisation — coining delightful zoological terms such as &amp;quot;billy-sheep&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;billy-dog&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;billy-hippopotamus&amp;quot; and so on. It was with great reluctance that we were unable to confirm the data.</abstract>

We want to use this sad opportunity to recall a visit which we to 1979. What we remember most from this visit is the very personal interest Professor Vauquois took in it.

For all three of us, this visit created a personal relationship that has lasted ever since. We will miss Professor Vauquois.</abstract>

Bernard and his group, in spite of the disintegrating tendencies at French universities of that time, formulated and implemented the then most complete and adequate MT system. The Praguean efforts had started, on a lesser scale, almost contemporaneously with the Grenoble group, have been highly reinforced by the regular contacts which started then and were continued up to our last meeting in November 1984. Bernard&apos;s energy, high requirements and friendly attitude towards international cooperation on an appropriate scientific level will be badly missed by the world&apos;s MT enterprises.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.991294478260869">Professor Vauquois was impressive both intellectually and physically. I can date my first encounter with him fairly precisely, because immediately afterwards I circuan in-house paper at Montreal (the forerunner of TAUM) on how the Grenoble Russian- French MT model could be applied to our English-French research. Everyone who knew Vauquois remembers him drawing the U-shaped outline of that model on a blackboard somewhere; he took it round the world. His exposition that day seduced me away from my muddling native British pragmatism to the conceptual light and power of algebraic modelling, and so I joined ranks with several of my French Canadian colleagues who had been Grenoble trained. That was in 1967 — nearly two decades ago! Grenoble was already a great international school. But of course Bernard had his human side too. Much of the warmth and some of the music will have gone out of the high-ceilinged old apartment in the centre of Grenoble. Likewise it is now nearly two decades since the snowy winter when he crowded into half a cosy Montreal duplex with cheerful Mme Vauquois and five (I think) younger children. By that time or soon after had become TAUM and we had begun to apply Colmerauer&apos;s Q-System. To show it off to him, somebody arranged that he would type in &amp;quot;Vauquois was met at the airport by Michel&amp;quot; (i.e., Michel van Canaghem, computer analyst and first Q-System French morphologist), whereupon our model-T interactive terminal would chug back with &amp;quot;Michel a rencontre Vauquois a l&apos;aeroport.&amp;quot; We waited for him to admire the transformation. However, his only comment was, &amp;quot;C&apos;est tres bien, mais puisque la rencontre etait il aurait fallu traduire a thought to myself, &amp;quot;In matters of language he&apos;s an unrelenting Frenchman.&amp;quot; The impression was confirmed a few years later when I heard him wince at the gross anglicism &amp;quot;linguistique computationnelle&amp;quot;, which we had in the organizing committee for On the other hand, I never managed to persuade him that his gallicism &amp;quot;automatic translation&apos; was an offence to English. Many will feel that Bernard Vauquois&apos;s death marks the passing away of an epoch. Anyway, it makes me feel for myself and very sorry for his family. and that model on the blackboard, are his monuments.</abstract>

Vauquois&apos;s encourage- Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 1, January-March 1986 45 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Bernard Vauquois ment and leadership was an important factor in the creation and early development of the TAUM translation project at the Universite de Montréal in the late 1960&apos;s. A visiting professor at the University in 1971-72, he exerted a strong professional and human influence on computer scientists and linguists alike. His personal warmth and involvement remained an important element in the exchanges between Montreal and Grenoble that have flourished since that time. His constant devotion to family, friends and colleagues will long be remembered. The world community of computational linguists owes a great deal of its cohesion and continued development to the leadership of Bernard Vauquois. Throughout the last two decades his role in ICCL&apos;s COLING conferences was a crucial one. In the early 70s, when automatic translation activity was at a low ebb worldwide, he personally guaranteed its survival through his leadership of GETA in Grenoble, and by his tireless efforts to promote international co-operation among active groups and individuals. In recent years Vauquois was at the forefront of a particularly successful series of exchanges between GETA and several research groups in Japan and Southeast Asia. Probably no other individual has played such a decisive role in the development of automatic translation as a scientific domain.</abstract>

We treasure the most pleasant memories of him. He invited Japanese colleagues to contributed actively to research on machine translation in Japan. We are certain that his contribution to the study of machine translation will never be forgotten. I will always associate Professor Vauquois with the beautiful scenery of Grenoble, where he invited me to stay for a year during 1969-70. He was so kind to visiting scholars, inviting them to his home, to go skiing, and for automobile drives in the mountains. I had frequent discussions with him about the methodology of machine translation, and was always enlightened by him. Since the stay in Grenoble, I met him often in Europe, the United States, Canada, and several times recently in Japan. Professor Vauquois was always enthusiastic about the possibility for better machine translation. We have to internalize his goals for high quality machine translation systems and to actively work toward realizing them in the near future. I have recently written a book on machine translation in Japanese, which I dedicated to the memory of Professor Vauquois.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.99890387037037">Asked what attracted him to machine translation as a field of research, Bernard Vauquois once stated: &amp;quot;You away from the ceteras.&amp;quot; like many disciplines abounds in ceteras, the author claims a much wider scope for his observations than the minuscule fragment he has actually investigated. Disappointingly, mathematizing trends and computational approaches seem to restrain such self-indulgence very little. Bernard Vauquois did not grant himself such freedom; he was too serious a scholar to want to avoid difficulties. One problem engaged Bernard Vauquois and his team of dedicated associates over a period, the length of which is more naturally stated in terms of fractions of a century than in numbers of years. When other efforts were, sometimes for good reasons, discontinued, Bernard Vauquois and his group built up a capital of trust that they were marching towards a goal. Plus, of course, a conviction with all those who learned to know Bernard Vauquois personally, that the work was based on unvarying intellectual honesty. Long-range research programmes have to be defended along two lines: they have to be protected from the trendy &amp;quot;avant gardists&amp;quot; who keep recasting their tools every second year to conform to the latest fashion; and they must ward off &amp;quot;ad hocities&amp;quot;. It is a bitter reflection — bitter to us observers for Bernard Vauquois was not inclined to self-pity — that a first-rank scholar had to spend time and energy in explaining the difference between real research and the lowest-level quasi-practical ad hocities — and had to do this not only to stray newspaper reporters but to the highest levels of national and multi-national decision-makers. Bernard Vauquois was not native to the domain of linguistics. Nor, of course, to computer science; no one of his generation could possibly be. It was a time of migration, and one migration wave brought the astronomer Vauquois to language studies. He brought with him a sense for completeness and accuracy and is one of the examples of how our field has profited from immigration. But on a personal level, Bernard Vauquois was not a migrant. He was unmistakably French and deeply rooted in French culture. He considered the size of the list of cheese in the local shop — 250, I think he told me — to be as important as the storage capacity in his computer. Speaking an English that was clearly continental, he played a European role without disowning his Frenchness and an international role without ceasing to sound European. It was, paradoxically, probably this very local rooting, plus the obviously good will and keen human interest behind a shy smile, that made people in so many broader circles — the common market, Eastern Europe, the Far East, and the academic community at large — listen to his low-keyed comments.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.958849823529412">For the past 25 years, Bernard Vauquois headed a series of machine translation projects at the University of Grenoble in France that were distinguished by the consistent exploration of sophisticated computational linguistic techniques. A paper describing a significant part of this work, entitled &amp;quot;Automated Translation at Grenoble University&amp;quot; (co-authored with Christian Boitet), appeared in the January-March 1985 issue of Linguistics 11, Number 1]. However, throughout his life he was a continuous source of new ideas and new projects and a powerful presence nationally and internationally in the field of machine translation. That his influence was not just local is illusby the the inception of which owes much to his efforts. Over the last five years he was instrumental in establishing, in both Malaysia and Thailand, research groups that are developing machine translation systems for the indigenous languages. In fact, it was in Penang that the leukemia, which claimed his life, resulted in hospitalization. He was transferred to Paris and seemed on the road to recovery when lung complications led to his death. From 1969 to 1984 Professor Vauquois chaired the International Committee on Computational Linguistics, the organizing body for the COLING conferences. I first met him at the 1967 Conference, not yet called COLING. It was an exciting meeting, and a significant part of that excitement was contributed by his enthusiasm and his organizational skills. However, equally well conveyed was his personal charm and his sense of humor. Throughout his life, he used these traits, coupled of course with his intellectual competence, in the service not only of computational linguistics and machine translation, but of scientific research more generally.</abstract>
