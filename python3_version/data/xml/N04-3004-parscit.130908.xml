Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996">
The MiTAP prototype for SARS detection
uses human language technology for detect-
ing, monitoring, and analyzing potential indi-
cators of infectious disease outbreaks and
reasoning for issuing warnings and alerts. Mi-
TAP focuses on providing timely, multi-
lingual information access to analysts, domain
experts, and decision-makers worldwide. Data
sources are captured, filtered, translated,
summarized, and categorized by content.
Critical information is automatically extracted
and tagged to facilitate browsing, searching,
and scanning, and to provide key terms at a
glance. The processed articles are made avail-
able through an easy-to-use news server and
cross-language information retrieval system
for access and analysis anywhere, any time.
Specialized newsgroups and customizable fil-
ters or searches on incoming stories allow us-
ers to create their own view into the data
while a variety of tools summarize, indicate
trends, and provide alerts to potentially rele-
vant spikes of activity.

tion. Recent examples of outbreaks include both the
HIV/AIDS and foot and mouth pandemics, the spread of
West Nile virus to and across the US, the escape of Rift
Valley Fever from Africa, SARS, and the translocation
of both mad cow disease (BSE) and monkey pox to the
United States.
Biological surveillance systems in the United States
rely most heavily on human medical data for signs of
epidemic activity. These systems span multiple organi-
zations and agencies, are often not integrated, and have
no alerting capability. As a result, responders have an
insufficient amount of lead time to prepare for biologi-
cal events or catastrophes.
Indications and Warnings (I&amp;Ws) provide the poten-
tial for early alert of impending biological events, per-
haps weeks to months in advance. Sources of I&amp;Ws
include transportation data, telecommunication traffic,
economic indices, Internet news, RSS feeds (RSS) in-
cluding weblogs, commerce, agricultural surveillance,
weather, and other environmental data. Retrospective
analyses of major infectious disease outbreaks (e.g.,
West Nile Virus and SARS) show that I&amp;Ws were pre-
sent weeks to months in advance, but these indicators
were missed because data sources were difficult to ob-
tain and hard to integrate. As a result, the available in-
formation was not utilized for appropriate national and
international response. This illuminates a critical need in
biodefense for an integrated system linking I&amp;Ws for
biological events from multiple and disparate sources
with the response community.

2 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994675547619047">
MiTAP (Damianos et al. 2002) was originally devel-
oped by the MITRE Corporation under the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
Translingual Information Detection Extraction and
Summarization (TIDES) program. TIDES aims to revo-
lutionize the way that information is obtained from hu-
man language by enabling people to find and interpret
relevant information quickly and effectively, regardless
of language or medium. MiTAP was initially created for
tracking and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks
and other biological threats as part of a DARPA Inte-
grated Feasibility Experiment in biosecurity to explore
the integration of synergistic TIDES language process-
ing technologies applied to a real world domain. The
system has since been expanded to other domains such
as weapons of mass destruction, satellite monitoring,
and suspect terrorist activity. In addition, researchers
and analysts are examining hundreds of MiTAP data
sources for differing perspectives on conflict and hu-
manitarian relief efforts.
Our newest MiTAP prototype explores the integra-
tion of outputs from operational data mining (anomaly
detection), human language technology (information
extraction, temporal tagging, machine translation, cross-
language information retrieval), and visualization tools
to detect SARS-specific I&amp;Ws in Asia, with relevance
to pathogen translocation to the United States. Using
feeds from English and Chinese language newswire,
weblogs, and other Internet data, the system translates
Chinese text data and tracks keyword combinations
thought to represent I&amp;Ws specific to SARS outbreaks
in China. Analysts can use cross-language information
retrieval for retrospective analysis and improving the
I&amp;W model, save searches to use as filters on incoming
data, view trends, and visualize the data along a time-
line. Figure 1 shows an overview of the prototype.
Warnings generated by this MiTAP prototype are in-
tended to complement traditional biosurveillance and
communications already in use by the international pub-
lic health community. This system represents an expan-
sion of current US surveillance capabilities to detect
biological agents of catastrophic potential.

3 Component Technologies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998812">
The MiTAP prototype relies extensively on human
language technology and expert system reasoning.
Below, MiTAP capabilities are described briefly
along with their contributing component
technologies.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.971837">
3.1 Information Processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99979553125">
After Internet news sources are captured and
normalized, they are passed through a zoner using
human-generated rules to identify source, date, and
other information such as headline, or title, and
content. The Alembic natural language analyzer (Ab-
erdeen et al. 1995; Vilain and Day 1996) processes
the zoned messages to identify paragraph, sentence,
and word boundaries as well as part-of-speech tags.
The messages then pass through the Alembic named
entity recognizer for identification and tagging of
person, organization, location, and disease names.
Finally, the article is processed by the TempEx
normalizing time expression tagger (Mani and Wil-
son 2000).
For Chinese and other non-English sources, the
CyberTrans machine translation system (Miller et al.
2001) is used to translate articles automatically into
English. CyberTrans wraps commercial and research
translation engines to produce a common set of
interfaces; the current prototype makes use of the
SYSTRAN Chinese-English system.
RSS feeds can provide a high volume textual ge-
stalt. Weblogs, in particular, are a good source of
timely text, some of which is topical and all of which
is based on personal observations and experiences.
Aggregate measurements on these feeds can provide
indications of public health-related phenom-
ena. Consider the relative rates of words and phrases
such as &amp;quot;stay home from&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;pneumonia.” Geotem-
poral location of non-seasonal spikes in relative rank
of these strings can establish suspicion for further
investigation by I&amp;W experts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999134">
3.2 Browsing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993157894737">
English language data and pairs of foreign language
documents and their translated versions are made
available on a news server (INN 2001) for browsing.
The system categorizes and bins articles into
newsgroups based on their content. To do this, the
system relies on a combination of the information
extraction results as well as human-generated rules
for pattern matching. Newsgroups are created to
provide multiple perspectives on the data; analysts
can subscribe to specific disease tracking
newsgroups, regional newsgroups, specific data
source newsgroups, or to customized topic tracking
newsgroups that may be based on several related
subjects.
Tagged entities in each article are color-coded to
enable rapid scanning of information and easy identi-
fication of key names. The five most frequently men-
tioned locations in each article as well as the top five
people are presented as a list for quick reference.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995225">
3.3 Information Retrieval
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961157894737">
To supplement access to the articles on the news
server and to allow for retrospective analysis, articles
are indexed using the Lucene information retrieval
system (The Jakarta Project 2001) for English
language documents and using PSE (Darwish 2002)
for foreign language documents. Web links are
maintained between foreign language documents and
their translated versions to allow for more accurate
human translations of selected documents.
Analysts can perform full text, source-specific
queries over the entire set of archived documents and
view the retrieved results as a relevance-ranked list or
as a plot across a timeline. A cross-language informa-
tion retrieval interface allows users to search in Eng-
lish across the Chinese language sources.
Users can also save specific search constraints to
be used as filters on incoming data. These saved
searches provide a simple analytic capability as well
as an alerting feature. (See below.)
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993229">
3.4 Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994245">
To assist analysts in identifying relevant and related
articles, we have integrated multi-document summa-
rization and watch lists. Columbia University’s
Newsblaster (McKeown et al. 2002) automatically
detects daily topics, clusters MiTAP articles around
those topics, and generates multi-document summari-
zations which are made available on the news server.
Multiple technologies (e.g., coreference, information
extraction) from Alias I, Inc. (Baldwin et al. 2002)
produces comprehensive views on specific named
entities (i.e., people or disease) across MiTAP docu-
ments. These views are summarized through ranked
lists, highlighting important topics of the day and
activities which might indicate disease outbreak.
Finely-tuned searches can be saved and applied as
filters or topic tracking mechanisms. These saved
searches are automatically updated at specific inter-
vals and can be aggregated and displayed visually as
bar graphs to reveal spikes of activity that otherwise
might go undetected.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.965474">
3.5 Alerting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986925">
The MiTAP prototype has two separate alerting ca-
pabilities: saved searches and an integrated expert
system. The saved search functionality allows ana-
lysts to set thresholds for alerting purposes. For ex-
ample, MiTAP can send email when any new article
arrives, when a specified maximum number of arti-
cles arrives, or when the daily number of new articles
increases by some percentage of the total or moving
average.
The Human Language Indication Detector
(HLID) performs data fusion on a number of dispa-
rate sources, compressing a large volume of informa-
tion into a smaller but more significant set of alerts.
HLID monitors a variety of sources including MiTAP
articles, information events in RSS feeds, and other
dynamically updated information on the World Wide
Web. HLID analyzes events from these sources in
real time and generates an estimate of significance
for each, complete with an audit trail of supporting
and negating evidence. This allows an analyst to di-
rect a search for indicators towards interesting data
while reducing the time spent investigating false
alarms and insignificant events.
HLID is composed of four major components.
The first is an event collector, which monitors a data
source and triggers action when an event is observed.
These events are sent to the rule based reasoning en-
gine, an expert system shell (JESS 2004) with hand
authored rules. The engine performs vetting and ini-
tial investigation of each event by identifying corre-
lated events, corroborating or invalidating evidence,
and references to supporting information. The engine
can also supplement its knowledge base by perform-
ing a directed search via the query management sys-
tem, which allows retrieval of information from a
wide variety of sources including databases and web
pages. Lastly, the alerting mechanism disseminates
the conclusions reached by the system and provides
an interface that allows an analyst to launch a deeper
search for indicators and warnings.

A cross-language information retrieval interface allows users to search in English across the Chinese language sources. Users can also save specific search constraints to be used as filters on incoming data. These saved searches provide a simple analytic capability as well as an alerting feature. (See below.) 3.4 Analysis To assist analysts in identifying relevant and related articles, we have integrated multi-document summarization and watch lists. Columbia University’s Newsblaster (McKeown et al. 2002) automatically detects daily topics, clusters MiTAP articles around those topics, and generates multi-document summarizations which are made available on the news server. Multiple technologies (e.g., coreference, information extraction) from Alias I, Inc. (Baldwin et al. 2002) produces comprehensive views on specific named entities (i.e., people or disease) across MiTAP documents. These views are summarized through ranked lists, highlighting important topics of the day and activities which might indicate disease outbreak. Finely-tuned searches can be saved and applied as filters or topic track</context>

Figure 1 Overview of the MiTAP prototype for SARS detection. 3 Component Technologies The MiTAP prototype relies extensively on human language technology and expert system reasoning. Below, MiTAP capabilities are described briefly along with their contributing component technologies. 3.1 Information Processing After Internet news sources are captured and normalized, they are passed through a zoner using human-generated rules to identify source, date, and other information such as headline, or title, and content. The Alembic natural language analyzer (Aberdeen et al. 1995; Vilain and Day 1996) processes the zoned messages to identify paragraph, sentence, and word boundaries as well as part-of-speech tags.
