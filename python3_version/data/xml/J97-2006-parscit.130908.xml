Many readers will be familiar with the quantitative and distributional techniques of
register analysis presented by Biber (1988). The present book re-uses this earlier study
on variation in British English [henceforth EL along with &amp;quot;a synthesis&amp;quot; (p. xv) of Ph.D.
studies done with Biber at the University of Southern California: by Niko Besnier
on Nukulaelae Tuvaluan [T], Mohamed Hared on Somali [S], and Kim Yong-Jin on
Korean [K], plus other work, especially by Ed Finegan and Dwight Atkinson. What is
new in this book is its cross-linguistic comparisons of register. Biber finds striking and
&amp;quot;highly systematic similarities&amp;quot; in the patterns of linguistic variation across languages,
and this leads him to propose &amp;quot;the possibility of cross-linguistic universals governing
the patterns of discourse variation&amp;quot; (p. 359).
The basis for this claim is the large differences between the four languages in their
genetic affiliations, cultural histories, uses in literacy, and so on. T is Austronesian,
with fewer than 350 speakers, on a small Pacific atoll. S is Afroasiatic, with 5 million
speakers. And K is Altaic, with 65 million speakers. Appendices provide grammatical
sketches of K and S, but not of T. And chapter 3 provides socio-cultural background on
the four languages, some of it fairly rough and ready: for example, it is not mentioned
that K is spoken in two different countries with very different political systems, and—I
suppose—different registers. And, as Biber admits, E consists of a highly variable set
of geographical and social varieties.
In chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5, Biber usefully overviews much previous work on register
variation and the methods of register analysis that he developed in his 1988 work. He
illustrates in detail the problems of trying to compare registers on the basis of isolated
linguistic features. And he argues for an alternative multidimensional approach, where
each dimension consists of a set of features that have been found to co-occur frequently
in texts. He summarizes methods of grammatically tagging corpora, calculating the
frequency of occurrence of features, using factor analysis to identify the dimensions,
and then attributing functional interpretations to the dimensions. The main data com-
prise: 1.7 million words of E, 153,000 words of T, 136,000 words of K, and 480,000
words of S.
Chapters 6, 7, and 8 present the main findings. First, Biber shows differences in
register variation across the languages. For example: T has a restricted range of regis-
ters, all interpersonal in some sense, with only two written registers, personal letters
and sermons, and no mass media; K and E have a similar range of spoken and written
registers, but K has a system of honorifics that constitute a separate dimension with
Book Review
no parallel in E, S. or T. Of course, we don&apos;t need computer-assisted tagging and factor
analysis to tell us that K has honorifics. However, the main claim is that, given the
major social and linguistic differences across the four languages, the cross-linguistic
similarities are far stronger than the differences. For example, all four languages have
multiple dimensions that distinguish between prototypical speaking (interpersonal:
on-line production) and writing (informational: careful, edited production). Biber also
documents a complementary argument that the diachronic evolution of written regis-
ters has been strikingly similar, over very different periods of time, in S and E.
The book has two main kinds of interest: descriptive and methodological. First,
Biber presents new linguistic descriptions and striking new hypotheses. (In this short
review, it is not possible to give examples of the detailed quantitative descriptions
of linguistic features given for dimensions.) In earlier work by others, register com-
parisons have been largely restricted to individual features (or at most a few features
regarded as distinctive), but have not been based on co-occurrence relations across
a wide range of features. There are few studies of register variation in non—Indo-
European languages, and few diachronic register studies. Biber also poses interesting
Halliday-type hypotheses about linguistic evolution, especially on the role of literacy
in extending the range of linguistic variation.
Second, the work is a very clear case where new, computer-assisted methods have
given access to new data, and thus opened up a series of research topics that were
previously inconceivable. Biber provides precise methods of comparing highly com-
plex objects: languages vary internally (synchronic register variation), but registers also
vary internally (some are narrowly clustered around a central mean, but others have a
large standard deviation; they may evolve diachronically; and there are both subreg-
isters and systematic differences within texts, e.g., between the beginnings, middles,
and ends).
There are certainly unanswered questions in both these areas. For example: (1) I
can find no specification of how accurate the tagging software was, just a note (p. 85)
that tagging was checked manually. (2) Biber emphasizes the importance of sampling
for register diversity. But even the English-language data are very incomplete in this
respect: e.g., the very large written genre of business correspondence is missing in
the standard corpora that he uses. (3) I assume from textual evidence that Biber has
linguistic competence in S, but not in K or T. But I can find no discussion of the possible
limitations of an analyst carrying out analyses for languages that she or he does not
know. (Was this not a standard topic in American structuralism and its aftermath in
the 1950s?)
Indeed, this last point raises the question of who might be competent to thoroughly
evaluate the book: three of the languages are not widely known, and I guess no one in
the world speaks all four languages discussed here (your reviewer certainly doesn&apos;t)
and, in addition, has expertise in factor analysis! So this short review can provide only
a preliminary and provisional evaluation of the book.
Given the book&apos;s topic, it seems fair to make a comment on its academic style. Biber
writes very clearly, but highly repetitively, and this long book would have benefited
from a severe editing. An advantage of written academic language as a register is
that it can be more condensed than spoken language, since readers can go back over
parts that seem unclear. As it was, I frequently read slightly different formulations in
different places, puzzled over whether a subtly different point was being made, and
usually concluded that it wasn&apos;t. As noted, much of the repetition is due to the book
having been &amp;quot;synthesized&amp;quot; from previous published work by Biber himself and his
colleagues.
Over the last ten years, Biber has shown the possibilities of combining new meth-

register variation, and now to formulate new hypotheses. But his cautiously formu-
lated claim that he may have found stylistic universals will take many years and much
further work to evaluate fully.
