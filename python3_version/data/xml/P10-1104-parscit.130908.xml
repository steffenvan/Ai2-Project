Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999554">
English noun/verb (N/V) pairs (contract,
cement) have undergone complex patterns
of change between 3 stress patterns for
several centuries. We describe a longitu-
dinal dataset of N/V pair pronunciations,
leading to a set of properties to be ac-
counted for by any computational model.
We analyze the dynamics of 5 dynamical
systems models of linguistic populations,
each derived from a model of learning by
individuals. We compare each model’s dy-
namics to a set of properties observed in
the N/V data, and reason about how as-
sumptions about individual learning affect
population-level dynamics.

The fascinating phenomena of language evolution
and language change have inspired much work
from computational perspectives in recent years.
Research in this field considers populations of lin-
guistic agents, and asks how the population dy-
namics are related to the behavior of individual
agents. However, most such work makes little
contact with empirical data (de Boer and Zuidema,
2009).1 As pointed out by Choudhury (2007),
most computational work on language change
deals with data from cases of change either not at
all, or at a relatively high level.2
Recent computational work has addressed “real
world” data from change in several languages
(Mitchener, 2005; Choudhury et al., 2006; Choud-
hury et al., 2007; Pearl and Weinberg, 2007; Da-
land et al., 2007; Landsbergen, 2009). In the same
1However, among language evolution researchers there
has been significant recent interest in behavioral experiments,
using the “iterated learning” paradigm (Griffiths and Kalish,
2007; Kalish et al., 2007; Kirby et al., 2008).

of change due to space constraints; see (Baker, 2008; Wang
et al., 2005; Niyogi, 2006) for reviews.
spirit, we use data from an ongoing stress shift
in English noun/verb (N/V) pairs. Because stress
has been listed in dictionaries for several centuries,
we are able to trace stress longitudinally and at
the level of individual words, and observe dynam-
ics significantly more complicated than in changes
previously considered in the computational litera-
ture. In §2, we summarize aspects of the dynamics
to be accounted for by any computational model of
the stress shift. We also discuss proposed sources
of these dynamics from the literature, based on ex-
perimental work by psychologists and linguists.
In §3–4, we develop models in the mathemati-
cal framework of dynamical systems (DS), which
over the past 15 years has been used to model
the interaction between language learning and lan-
guage change in a variety of settings (Niyogi
and Berwick, 1995; Niyogi and Berwick, 1996;
Niyogi, 2006; Komarova et al., 2001; Yang, 2001;
Yang, 2002; Mitchener, 2005; Pearl and Weinberg,
2007).
We interpret 6 aspects of the N/V stress dy-
namics in DS terms; this gives a set of 6 desired
properties to which any DS model’s dynamics can
be compared. We consider 5 models of language
learning by individuals, based on the experimen-
tal findings relevant to the N/V stress shift, and
evaluate the population-level dynamics of the dy-
namical system model resulting from each against
the set of desired properties. We are thus able to
reason about which theories of the source of lan-
guage change — considered as hypotheses about
how individuals learn — lead to the population-
level patterns observed in change.

to denote the stress of an N/V pair, with 1=Qσ,
2=σQ. Of the four logically possible stress pat-
terns, all current N/V pairs follow one of the 3
patterns shown in Table 1: {1,1}, {1,2}, {2,2}.3
No pair follows the fourth possible pattern, {2,1}.
N/V pairs have been undergoing variation and
change between these 3 patterns since Middle En-
glish (ME, c. 1066-1470), especially change to
{1,2}. The vast majority of stress shifts occurred
after 1570 (Minkova, 1997), when the first dictio-
nary listing English word stresses was published
(Levens, 1570). Many dictionaries from the 17th
century on list word stresses, making it possible to
trace change in the stress of individual N/V pairs
in considerable detail.

Expanding on dictionary pronunciation data col-
lected by Sherman (1975) for the period 1570–
1800, we have collected a corpus of pronunci-
ations of 149 N/V pairs, as listed in 62 British
dictionaries, published 1570–2007. Variation and
change in N/V pair stress can be visualized by
plotting stress trajectories: the moving average of
N and V stress vs. time for a given pair. Some
examples are shown in Fig. 1. The corpus is
described in detail in (Sonderegger and Niyogi,
2010); here we summarize the relevant facts to be
accounted for in a computational model.4
Change Four types of clear-cut change between
the three stress patterns are observed:
{2,2}→{1,2} (Fig.1(a)) {1,2}→{1,1}
{1,1}→{1,2} (Fig. 1(b)) {1,2}→{2,2}
However, change to {1,2} is much more com-
mon than change from {1,2}; in particular,
{2,2}→{1,2} is the most common change. When

3However, as variation and change in N/V pair stress
is ongoing, a few pairs (e.g. perfume) currently have vari-
able stress. By “stress”, we always mean “primary stress”.
All present-day pronunciations are for British English, from
CELEX (Baayen et al., 1996).

change occurs, it is often fairly sudden, as in
Figs. 1(a), 1(b). Finally, change never occurs di-
rectly between {1,1} and {2,2}.
Stability Previous work on stress in N/V pairs
(Sherman, 1975; Phillips, 1984) has emphasized
change, in particular {2,2}→{1,2} (the most com-
mon change). However, an important aspect of
the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs is stability:
most N/V pairs do not show variation or change.
The 149 N/V pairs, used both in our corpus and
in previous work, were chosen by Sherman (1975)
as those most likely to have undergone change,
and thus are not suitable for studying how stable
the three attested stress patterns are. In a ran-
dom sample of N/V pairs (not the set of 149) in
use over a fixed time period (1700–2007), we find
that only 12% have shown variation or change in
stress (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010). Most pairs
maintain the {1,1}, {2,2}, or {1,2} stress pattern
for hundreds of years. A model of the diachronic
dynamics of N/V pair stress must explain how it
can be the case both that some pairs show varia-
tion and change, and that many do not.
Variation N/V pair stress patterns show both
synchronic and diachronic variation.
Synchronically, there is variation at the pop-
ulation level in the stress of some N/V pairs at
any given time; this is reflected by the inclusion
of more than one pronunciation for some N/V
pairs in many dictionaries. An important question
for modeling is whether there is variation within
individual speakers. We show in (Sonderegger
and Niyogi, 2010) that there is, for present-day
American English speakers, using a corpus of ra-
dio speech. For several N/V pairs which have
currently variable pronunciation, 1/3 of speakers
show variation in the stress of the N form. Metrical
evidence from poetry suggests that individual vari-
ation also existed in the past; the best evidence is
for Shakespeare, who shows variation in the stress
of over 20 N/V pairs (K¨okeritz, 1953).
Diachronically, a relevant question for mod-
eling is whether all variation is short-lived, or
whether stable variation is possible. A particu-
lar type of stable variation is in fact observed rela-
tively often in the corpus: either the N or V form
stably vary (Fig. 1(c)), but not both at once. Stable
variation where both N and V forms vary almost
never occurs (Fig. 1(d)).

esizes that N/V pairs with lower frequencies
(summed N+V word frequencies) are more likely
to change to {1,2}. Sonderegger (2010) shows
that this is the case for the most common change,
{2,2}→{1,2}: among N/V pairs which were
{2,2} in 1700 and are either {2,2} or {1,2} today,
those which have undergone change have signif-
icantly lower frequencies, on average, than those
which have not. In (Sonderegger and Niyogi,
2010), we give preliminary evidence from real-
time frequency trajectories (for &lt;10 N/V pairs)
that it is not lower frequency per se which triggers
change to {1,2}, but falling frequency. For exam-
ple, change in combat from {1,1}→{1,2} around
1800 (Fig. 1(b)) coincides with falling word fre-
quency from 1775–present.

2.2 Sources of change
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999329484375">
The most salient facts about English N/V pair
stress are that (a) change is most often to {1,2}
(b) the {2,1} pattern never occurs. We summa-
rize two types of explanation for these facts from
the experimental literature, each of which exem-
plifies a commonly-proposed type of explanation
for phonological change. In both cases, there is ex-
perimental evidence for biases in present-day En-
glish speakers reflecting (a–b). We assume that
these biases have been active over the course of
the N/V stress shift, and can thus be seen as pos-
sible sources of the diachronic dynamics of N/V
pairs.5
5This type of assumption is necessary for any hypothesis
about the sources of a completed or ongoing change, based
on present-day experimental evidence, and is thus common in
the literature. In the case of N/V pairs, it is implicitly made in
Kelly’s (1988 et seq) account, discussed below. Both biases
discussed here stem from facts about English (Ross’ Gener-
alization; rhythmic context) that we believe have not changed
over the time period considered here (Pz�1600–present), based
on general accounts of English historical phonology during
this period (Lass, 1992; MacMahon, 1998). We leave more
careful verification of this claim to future work.
Analogy/Lexicon In historical linguistics, ana-
logical changes are those which make “...related
forms more similar to each other in their phonetic
(and morphological) structure” (Hock, 1991).6
Proposed causes for analogical change thus often
involve a speaker’s production and perception of
a form being influenced by similar forms in their
lexicon.
The English lexicon shows a broad tendency,
which we call Ross’ generalization, which could
be argued to be driving analogical change to {1,2},
and acting against the unobserved stress pattern
{2,1}: “primary stress in English nouns is farther
to the left than primary stress in English verbs”
(Ross, 1973). Change to {1,2} could be seen
as motivated by Ross’ generalization, and {2,1}
made impossible by it.
The argument is lent plausibility by experimen-
tal evidence that Ross’ Generalization is reflected
in production and perception. English listeners
strongly prefer the typical stress pattern (N=QQ or
V=QQ) in novel English disyllables (Guion et al.,
2003), and process atypical disyllables (N=QQ or
V=QQ) more slowly than typical ones (Arciuli and
Cupples, 2003).
Mistransmission An influential line of research
holds that many phonological changes are based
in asymmetric transmission errors: because of ar-
ticulatory or perceptual factors, listeners systemat-
ically mishear some sound α as Q, but rarely mis-
hear Q as α.7 We call such effects mistransmis-
sion. Asymmetric mistransmission (by individu-
6“Forms” here means any linguistic unit; e.g. sounds,
words, or paradigms, such as an N/V pair’s stress pattern.
7A standard example is final obstruent devoicing, a com-
mon change cross-linguistically. There are several articula-
tory and perceptual reasons why final voiced obstruents could
be heard as unvoiced, but no motivation for the reverse pro-
cess (final unvoiced obstruents heard as voiced) (Blevins,
2006).

als) is argued to be a necessary condition for the
change α→β at the population level, and an ex-
planation for why the change α→β is common,
while the change β→α is rarely (or never) ob-
served. Mistransmission-based explanations were
pioneered by Ohala (1981, et seq.), and are the
subject of much recent work (reviewed by Hans-
son, 2008)
For English N/V pairs, M. Kelly and collabo-
rators have shown mistransmission effects which
they propose are responsible for the directionality
of the most common type of N/V pair stress shifts
({1,1}, {2,2}→{1,2}), based on “rhythmic con-
text” (Kelly, 1988; Kelly and Bock, 1988; Kelly,
1989). Word stress is misperceived more often
as initial in “trochaic-biasing” contexts, where the
preceding syllable is weak or the following syl-
lable is heavy; and more often as final in anal-
ogously “iambic-biasing” contexts. Nouns occur
more frequently in trochaic contexts, and verbs
more frequently in iambic contexts; there is thus
pressure for the V forms of {1,1} pairs to be mis-
perceived as σQ, and for the N forms of {2,2} pairs
to be misperceived as Qσ.

3 Modeling preliminaries
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987135">
We first describe assumptions and notation for
models developed below (§4).
Because of the evidence for within-speaker
variation in N/V pair stress (§2.1), in all models
described below, we assume that what is learned
for a given N/V pair are the probabilities of using
the σQ form for the N and V forms.
We also make several simplifying assumptions.
There are discrete generations Gt, and learners in
Gt learn from Gt_1. Each example a learner in Gt
hears is equally likely to come from any member
of Gt_1. Each learner receives an identical num-
ber of examples, and each generation has infinitely
many members.
These are idealizations, adopted here to keep
models simple enough to analyze; the effects of
relaxing some of these assumptions have been ex-
plored by Niyogi (2006) and Sonderegger (2009).
The infinite-population assumption in particular
makes the dynamics fully deterministic; this rules
out the possibility of change due to drift (or sam-
ple variation), where a form disappears from the
population because no examples of it are encoun-
tered by learners in Gt in the input from Gt_1.
Notation For a fixed N/V pair, a learner in Gt
hears N1 examples of the N form, of which kt1 are
σQ and (N1-kt1) are Qσ; N2 and kt2 are similarly
defined for V examples. Each example is sampled
i.i.d. from a random member of Gt_1. The Ni are
fixed (each learner hears the same number of ex-
amples), while the kti are random variables (over
learners in Gt). Each learner applies an algorithm
A to the N1+N2 examples to learn at, A ∈ [0, 1],
the probabilities of producing N and V examples
as σQ. αt, βt are the expectation of at and A over
members of Gt: αt = E(at), βt = E( A). at and
Qt are thus random variables (over learners in Gt),
while αt, βt ∈ [0, 1] are numbers.
Because learners in Gt draw examples at ran-
dom from members of Gt_1, the distributions

3.1 Dynamical systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95107">
We develop and analyze models of populations of
language learners in the mathematical framework
of (discrete) dynamical systems (DS) (Niyogi and
Berwick, 1995; Niyogi, 2006). This setting allows
us to determine the diachronic, population-level
consequences of assumptions about the learning
algorithm used by individuals, as well as assump-
tions about population structure or the input they
receive.
Because it is in general impossible to solve a
given iterated map as a function of t, the dynam-
ical systems viewpoint is to understand its long-
term behavior by finding its fixed points and bi-
furcations: changes in the number and stability of
fixed points as system parameters vary.
Briefly, α* is a fixed point (FP) of f if f(α*) =
α*; it is stable if lira
t→oo αt = α* for α0 sufficiently
near α*, and unstable otherwise; these are also
called stable states and unstable states. Intuitively,
α* is stable iff the system is stable under small per-
turbations from α*.8
In the context of a linguistic population, change
from state α (100% of the population uses {1,1})
to state β (100% of the population uses {1,2})
corresponds to a bifurcation, where some system
parameter (N) passes a critical value (N0). For

We now describe 5 DS models, each correspond-
ing to a learning algorithm A used by individual
language learners. Each A leads to an iterated
map, f(αt, βt) = (αt+1, βt+1), which describes
the state of the population of learners over succes-
sive generations. We give these evolution equa-
tions for each model, then discuss their dynamics,
i.e. bifurcation structure. Each model’s dynam-
ics are evaluated with respect to the set of desired
properties corresponding to patterns observed in
the N/V data. Derivations have been mostly omit-
ted for reasons of space, but are given in (Son-
deregger, 2009).
The models differ along two dimensions, cor-
responding to assumptions about the learning al-
gorithm (A): whether or not it is assumed that
the stress of examples is possibly mistransmitted
(Models 1, 3, 5), and how the N and V probabil-
ities acquired by a given learner are coupled. In
Model 1 there is no coupling (ˆαt and ˆβt learned
independently), in Models 2–3 coupling takes the
form of a hard constraint corresponding to Ross’
generalization, and in Models 4–5 different stress
patterns have different prior probabilities.9

Motivated by the evidence for English speak-

in which the learner attempts to probability match
as above, but the (at, Qt) learned must satisfy the
constraint that σQ stress be more probable in the
V form than in the N form.
Formally, the learner chooses (at, �βt) satisfying

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998853647058824">
The type of coupling assume in Models 2–3 — a
constraint on the relative probability of σQ stress
for N and V forms — has the drawback that there
is no way for the rest of the lexicon to affect a
pair’s N and V stress probabilities: there can be no
influence of the stress of other N/V pairs, or in the
lexicon as a whole, on the N/V pair being learned.
Models 4–5 allow such influence by formalizing a
simple intuitive explanation for the lack of {2, 1}
N/V pairs: learners cannot hypothesize a {2, 1}
pair because there is no support for this pattern in
their lexicons.
We now assume that learners compute the prob-
abilities of each possible N/V pair stress pattern,
rather than separate probabilities for the N and V
forms. We assume that learners keep two sets of
probabilities (for {1, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 1}, {2, 2}):

gives that the (αt,βt) trajectories are lines
of constant αt + βt (Fig. 2). All (0, x)

This model thus has sta-
ble FPs corresponding to
{1,1}, {1,2}, and {2,2},
does not have {2,1} as
a stable FP (by construc-
tion), and allows for sta-
ble variation in exactly

how much support exists in their lexicon for the
different stress patterns.
We leave the exact interpretation of the λij am-
biguous; they could be the percentage of N/V pairs
already learned which follow each stress pattern,
for example. Motivated by the absence of {2,1}
N/V pairs in English, we assume that λ21 = 0.

The parameter space is again split into these
regions by three hyperplanes: A011=A012, A022=A012,
and R0=1. As in Model 4, the bifurcation structure
implies all 6 possible changes between the three
FPs. However, change to {1,2} entails crossing
the hyperplanes A011=A012 and A02=A012, and is thus
now frequency dependent.
In particular, consider a system at a stable FP
(&apos;y,1), for some N/V pair. This FP becomes un-
stable if A022 becomes smaller than A012. Assuming
that the Aij are fixed, this occurs only if N1 falls
below a critical value, N∗1 = (1 − λ22 λ12(1 − p))−1;
the system would then transition to (0, 1), the only
stable state. By a similar argument, falling fre-
quency can lead to change from (0, n) to (0, 1).
Falling frequency can thus cause change to {1,2}
in this model, as seen in the N/V data; Fig. 4 shows
an example.
Unlike in Model 4, stable variation of the type
seen in the N/V stress trajectories — one of N or V
stably varying, but not both — is possible for some
parameter values. (0, 0) and (1, 1) (corresponding
to {1,1} and {2,2}) are technically never possible,
but effectively occur for FPs of the form (n, 0) and
(&apos;y,1) when n or &apos;y are small. {2,1} is never a sta-
ble FP, by construction.
This model thus arguably shows all of the de-
sired properties seen in the N/V data.

Table 2 lists which of Models 1–5 show each of
the desired properties (from §3.2), corresponding
to aspects of the observed diachronic dynamics of
N/V pair stress.
Based on this set of models, we are able to
make some observations about the effect of dif-
ferent assumptions about learning by individuals
on population-level dynamics. Models including
asymmetric mistransmission (1, 3, 5) generally do
not lead to stable states in which the entire pop-
ulation uses {1,1} or {2,2}. (In Model 5, sta-
ble variation very near {1,1} or {2,2} is possi-
ble.) However, {1,1} and {2,2} are diachroni-
cally very stable stress patterns, suggesting that at
least for this model set, assuming mistransmission
in the learner is problematic. Models 2–3, where
analogy is implemented as a hard constraint based
on Ross’ generalization, do not give most desired
properties. Models 4–5, where analogy is imple-
mented as prior probabilities over N/V stress pat-
terns, show crucial aspects of the observed dynam-
ics: bifurcations corresponding to the changes ob-
served in the stress data. Model 5 shows change
to {1,2} triggered by falling frequency, a pattern
observed in the stress data, and an emergent prop-
erty of the model dynamics: this frequency effect
is not present in Models 1 or 4, but is present in
Model 5, where the learner combines mistransmis-
sion (Model 1) with coupling by priors (Model 4).

rithm for individuals. The algorithms considered

<bodyText confidence="0.999992766666667">
were motivated by different possible sources of
change, from linguistics and psychology (§2.2).
We discuss novel contributions of this work, and
future directions.
The dataset used here shows more complex dy-
namics, to our knowledge, than in changes previ-
ously considered in the computational literature.
By using a detailed, longitudinal dataset, we were
able to strongly constrain the desired behavior of
a computational model, so that the task of model
building is not “doomed to success”. While all
models show some patterns observed in the data,
only one shows all such properties. We believe de-
tailed datasets are potentially very useful for eval-
uating and differentiating between proposed com-
putational models of change.
This paper is a first attempt to integrate detailed
data with a range of DS models. We have only
considered some schematic properties of the dy-
namics observed in our dataset, and used these
to qualitatively compare each model’s predictions
to the dynamics. Future work should consider
the dynamics in more detail, develop more com-
plex models (for example, by relaxing the infinite-
population assumption, allowing for stochastic dy-
namics), and quantitatively compare model pre-
dictions and observed dynamics.
We were able to reason about how assump-
tions about individual learning affect population
dynamics by analyzing a range of simple, related
models. This approach is pursued in more depth
in the larger set of models considered in (Son-
deregger, 2009). Our use of model comparison
contrasts with most recent computational work on
change, where a small number (1–2) of very com-
plex models are analyzed, allowing for much more
detailed models of language learning and usage
than those considered here (e.g. Choudhury et al.,
2006; Minett &amp; Wang, 2008; Baxter et al., 2009;
Landsbergen, 2009). An advantage of our ap-
proach is an enhanced ability to evaluate a range of
proposed causes for a particular case of language
change.
By using simple models, we were able to con-
sider a range of learning algorithms correspond-
ing to different explanations for the observed di-
achronic dynamics. What makes this a useful ex-
ercise is the fundamentally non-trivial map, illus-
trated by Models 1–5, between individual learn-
ing and population-level dynamics. Although the
type of individual learning assumed in each model
was chosen with the same patterns of change in
mind, and despite the simplicity of the models
used, the resulting population-level dynamics dif-
fer greatly. This is an important point given that
proposed explanations for change (e.g., mistrans-
mission and analogy) operate at the level of in-
dividuals, while the phenomena being explained
(patterns of change, or particular changes) are as-
pects of the population-level dynamics.

<abstract confidence="0.9978785625">noun/verb (N/V) pairs have undergone complex patterns of change between 3 stress patterns for several centuries. We describe a longitudinal dataset of N/V pair pronunciations, leading to a set of properties to be accounted for by any computational model. We analyze the dynamics of 5 dynamical systems models of linguistic populations, each derived from a model of learning by individuals. We compare each model’s dynamics to a set of properties observed in the N/V data, and reason about how assumptions about individual learning affect population-level dynamics.</abstract>

When 3However, as variation and change in N/V pair stress is ongoing, a few pairs (e.g. perfume) currently have variable stress. By “stress”, we always mean “primary stress”.

Stability Previous work on stress in N/V pairs (Sherman, 1975; Phillips, 1984) has emphasized change, in particular {2,2}→{1,2} (the most common change). However, an important aspect of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs is stability: most N/V pairs do not show variation or change.

Briefly, α* is a fixed point (FP) of f if f(α*) = α*; it is stable if lira t→oo αt = α* for α0 sufficiently near α*, and unstable otherwise; these are also called stable states and unstable states. Intuitively, α* is stable iff the system is stable under small perturbations from α*.8 In the context of a linguistic population, change from state α (100% of the population uses {1,1}) to state β (100% of the population uses {1,2}) corresponds to a bifurcation, where some system parameter (N) passes a critical value (N0).

We use the notation {Nstress,Vstress} to denote the stress of an N/V pair, with 1=Qσ, 2=σQ. Of the four logically possible stress patterns, all current N/V pairs follow one of the 3 patterns shown in Table 1: {1,1}, {1,2}, {2,2}.3 No pair follows the fourth possible pattern, {2,1}. N/V pairs have been undergoing variation and change between these 3 patterns since Middle English (ME, c. 1066-1470), especially change to {1,2}. The vast majority of stress shifts occurred after 1570 (Minkova, 1997), when the first dictionary listing English word stresses was published (Levens, 1570). Many dictionaries from the 17th century on list word stresses, making it possible to trace change in the stress of individual N/V pairs in considerable detail. 2.1 Dynamics Expanding on dictionary pronunciation data collected by Sherman (1975) for the period 1570– 1800, we have collected a corpus of pronunciations of 149 N/V pairs, as listed in 62 British dictionaries, published 1570–2007. Variation and change in N/V pair stress can be visualized by plotting stress trajectories: the moving average of N and V stress vs. time for a given pair. Some examples are shown in Fig. 1.

We also make several simplifying assumptions. There are discrete generations Gt, and learners in Gt learn from Gt_1. Each example a learner in Gt hears is equally likely to come from any member of Gt_1. Each learner receives an identical number of examples, and each generation has infinitely many members. These are idealizations, adopted here to keep models simple enough to analyze; the effects of relaxing some of these assumptions have been explored by Niyogi (2006) and Sonderegger (2009). The infinite-population assumption in particular makes the dynamics fully deterministic; this rules out the possibility of change due to drift (or sample variation), where a form disappears from the population because no examples of it are encountered by learners in Gt in the input from Gt_1. Notation For a fixed N/V pair, a learner in Gt hears N1 examples of the N form, of which kt1 are σQ and (N1-kt1) are Qσ; N2 and kt2 are similarly defined for V examples.

The English lexicon shows a broad tendency, which we call Ross’ generalization, which could be argued to be driving analogical change to {1,2}, and acting against the unobserved stress pattern {2,1}: “primary stress in English nouns is farther to the left than primary stress in English verbs” (Ross, 1973). Change to {1,2} could be seen as motivated by Ross’ generalization, and {2,1} made impossible by it. The argument is lent plausibility by experimental evidence that Ross’ Generalization is reflected in production and perception. English listeners strongly prefer the typical stress pattern (N=QQ or V=QQ) in novel English disyllables (Guion et al., 2003), and process atypical disyllables (N=QQ or V=QQ) more slowly than typical ones (Arciuli and Cupples, 2003).

Variation and change in N/V pair stress can be visualized by plotting stress trajectories: the moving average of N and V stress vs. time for a given pair. Some examples are shown in Fig. 1. The corpus is described in detail in (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010); here we summarize the relevant facts to be accounted for in a computational model.4 Change Four types of clear-cut change between the three stress patterns are observed: {2,2}→{1,2} (Fig.1(a)) {1,2}→{1,1} {1,1}→{1,2} (Fig. 1(b)) {1,2}→{2,2} However, change to {1,2} is much more common than change from {1,2}; in particular, {2,2}→{1,2} is the most common change. When 3However, as variation and change in N/V pair stress is ongoing, a few pairs (e.g. perfume) currently have variable stress. By “stress”, we always mean “primary stress”. All present-day pronunciations are for British English, fro</context>

However, an important aspect of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs is stability: most N/V pairs do not show variation or change. The 149 N/V pairs, used both in our corpus and in previous work, were chosen by Sherman (1975) as those most likely to have undergone change, and thus are not suitable for studying how stable the three attested stress patterns are. In a random sample of N/V pairs (not the set of 149) in use over a fixed time period (1700–2007), we find that only 12% have shown variation or change in stress (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010). Most pairs maintain the {1,1}, {2,2}, or {1,2} stress pattern for hundreds of years. A model of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pair stress must explain how it can be the case both that some pairs show variation and change, and that many do not. Variation N/V pair stress patterns show both synchronic and diachronic variation. Synchronically, there is variation at the population level in the stress of some N/V pairs at any given time; this is reflected by the inclusion of more than one pronunciation for some N/V pairs in many dictionaries. An important question for modeling is whether there is</context>

Sonderegger (2010) shows that this is the case for the most common change, {2,2}→{1,2}: among N/V pairs which were {2,2} in 1700 and are either {2,2} or {1,2} today, those which have undergone change have significantly lower frequencies, on average, than those which have not. In (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010), we give preliminary evidence from realtime frequency trajectories (for &lt;10 N/V pairs) that it is not lower frequency per se which triggers change to {1,2}, but falling frequency. For example, change in combat from {1,1}→{1,2} around 1800 (Fig. 1(b)) coincides with falling word frequency from 1775–present. 2.2 Sources of change The most salient facts about English N/V pair stress are that (a) change is most often to {1,2} (b) the {2,1} pattern never occurs. We summarize two types of explanation for these facts from the experimental literature, each of which exemplifies a commonly-proposed typ</context>

We also make several simplifying assumptions. There are discrete generations Gt, and learners in Gt learn from Gt_1. Each example a learner in Gt hears is equally likely to come from any member of Gt_1. Each learner receives an identical number of examples, and each generation has infinitely many members. These are idealizations, adopted here to keep models simple enough to analyze; the effects of relaxing some of these assumptions have been explored by Niyogi (2006) and Sonderegger (2009). The infinite-population assumption in particular makes the dynamics fully deterministic; this rules out the possibility of change due to drift (or sample variation), where a form disappears from the population because no examples of it are encountered by learners in Gt in the input from Gt_1. Notation For a fixed N/V pair, a learner in Gt hears N1 examples of the N form, of which kt1 are σQ and (N1-kt1) are Qσ; N2 and kt2 are similarly defined for V examples. Each example is sampled i.i.d. from a random member of Gt_1. The Ni are fixed (each learner hears the same number of examples), while </context>

Each A leads to an iterated map, f(αt, βt) = (αt+1, βt+1), which describes the state of the population of learners over successive generations. We give these evolution equations for each model, then discuss their dynamics, i.e. bifurcation structure. Each model’s dynamics are evaluated with respect to the set of desired properties corresponding to patterns observed in the N/V data. Derivations have been mostly omitted for reasons of space, but are given in (Sonderegger, 2009). The models differ along two dimensions, corresponding to assumptions about the learning algorithm (A): whether or not it is assumed that the stress of examples is possibly mistransmitted (Models 1, 3, 5), and how the N and V probabilities acquired by a given learner are coupled. In Model 1 there is no coupling (ˆαt and ˆβt learned independently), in Models 2–3 coupling takes the form of a hard constraint corresponding to Ross’ generalization, and in Models 4–5 different stress patterns have different prior probabilities.9 4.1 Model 1: Mistransmission Motivated by the evidence for asymmetric </context>

Future work should consider the dynamics in more detail, develop more complex models (for example, by relaxing the infinitepopulation assumption, allowing for stochastic dynamics), and quantitatively compare model predictions and observed dynamics. We were able to reason about how assumptions about individual learning affect population dynamics by analyzing a range of simple, related models. This approach is pursued in more depth in the larger set of models considered in (Sonderegger, 2009). Our use of model comparison contrasts with most recent computational work on change, where a small number (1–2) of very complex models are analyzed, allowing for much more detailed models of language learning and usage than those considered here (e.g. Choudhury et al., 2006; Minett &amp; Wang, 2008; Baxter et al., 2009; Landsbergen, 2009). An advantage of our approach is an enhanced ability to evaluate a range of proposed causes for a particular case of language change.
