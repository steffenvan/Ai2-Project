<bodyText confidence="0.999977914285714">
Semantic parsing is the task of mapping natural
language sentences into complete formal mean-
ing representations which a computer can exe-
cute for some domain-specific application. This
is a challenging task and is critical for develop-
ing computing systems that can understand and
process natural language input, for example, a
computing system that answers natural language
queries about a database, or a robot that takes
commands in natural language. While the im-
portance of semantic parsing was realized a long
time ago, it is only in the past few years that the
state-of-the-art in semantic parsing has been sig-
nificantly advanced with more accurate and ro-
bust semantic parser learners that use a variety
of statistical learning methods. Semantic parsers
have also been extended to work beyond a single
sentence, for example, to use discourse contexts
and to learn domain-specific language from per-
ceptual contexts. Some of the future research di-
rections of semantic parsing with potentially large
impacts include mapping entire natural language
documents into machine processable form to en-
able automated reasoning about them and to con-
vert natural language web pages into machine pro-
cessable representations for the Semantic Web to
support automated high-end web applications.
This tutorial will introduce the semantic pars-
ing task and will bring the audience up-to-date
with the current research and state-of-the-art in se-
mantic parsing. It will also provide insights about
semantic parsing and how it relates to and dif-
fers from other natural language processing tasks.
It will point out research challenges and some
promising future directions for semantic parsing.

The proposed tutorial on semantic parsing will
start with an introduction to the task, giving ex-
amples of some application domains and meaning
representation languages. It will also point out its
distinctions from and relations to other NLP tasks.
Next, it will talk in depth about various semantic
parsers that have been built, starting with earlier
hand-built systems to the current state-of-the-art
statistical semantic parser learners. It will point
out the underlying commonalities and differences
between the learners. The next section of the tuto-
rial will talk about the recent advances in extend-
ing semantic parsing to work beyond parsing a sin-
gle sentence. Finally, the tutorial will point out
the current research challenges and some promis-
ing future directions for semantic parsing.
