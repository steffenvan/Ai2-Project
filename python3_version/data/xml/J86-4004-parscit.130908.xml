This report aims to identify the areas where NLP (natural
language processing) is expected to be successful, and to
suggest how people and organisations can make use of
the opportunities it will create, as users, suppliers or
investors. (p. 4)
Tim Johnson has written a very useful guide to the
commercial side of NLP applications. It is a large,
comprehensive report that runs 459 double-spaced pages.
Johnson is a graduate of Imperial College and has previ-
ously written a report on Expert Systems (July 1984), so
he is familiar with work in other areas of machine intelli-
gence. This report is better technically than one might
expect from a layman. At $395 it is probably most
appropriate for managers or researchers who are actively
involved in the marketplace and for institutional or
library copies.
The major sections of the report are Management
Summary, Markets, Technology, Applications, and
Company Profiles. The first two sections are of primary
interest either to those who are unfamiliar with the major
application areas of NLP (described as mainframe and
micro database interfaces, dialogue interfaces, content
scanning, text editing, machine translation, and talkwri-
ter) or with the business side of projected markets. For
example, total US market projections are given as $15M
in 1985, $420M in 1990, and $1500M in 1995. These
projections are also broken down by application area.
For active researchers in NLP, the technology section
will not contain any major surprises. A very brief tour of
approaches in syntactic and semantic parsing is followed
by a review of current systems in both the mainframe
and micro markets. These include Intellect, Ramis II
English, Plume, Themis, Easytalk, Clout, NaturalLink,
Savvy, Microdata Natural Language, Safeguard Cash-
Management System, Logos&apos;s Intelligent Translator,
ALPS Computer Translation System, Smart Translator,
and Weidner MicroCAT. For each of these systems,
there is a brief discussion of the product and a summary
table that lists pertinent data such as availability, price,
computer requirements, implementation language, oppor-
tunities for customizing, the software interface, the
underlying NL technology, input requirements (menu-dri-
ven, ill-formed input, spelling correction), vocabulary
size, and dialog management facilities (e.g., ellipsis and
anaphora).
The last two sections of the report contain the material
of greatest interest to me, since it is not readily available
elsewhere. The application section describes user experi-
ences with a number of systems. For example, PPG, an
Intellect site, estimates that they were handling 300-500
queries a day in early 1985. In one anecdote, &amp;quot;it took
two questions and about five minutes through Intellect to
come up with data that would have taken hours by any
other route.&amp;quot; Johnson also describes the experience of
Cognitive Systems with Explorer, a custom system that
accesses a cartographic geologic database for oil explora-
tion.
The last section contains profiles of 30 organizations
engaged in NLP research or development. The organiza-
tions include companies, research labs, and universities.
This is the place to find out what is going on at Kurzweil
now, what venture capital is supporting the company
(Xerox and Wang among others), who has non-exclusive
marketing rights to Kurzweil&apos;s AT products (Xerox), how
many staff they have (50), who their major players are
(Dennis Klatt, Francis Ganong, Susumu Kuno and Glen
Akers), how they are doing and where they are going.
Even those who think they have a fairly comprehensive
mental &amp;quot;who&apos;s who&amp;quot; of the field should still find this
section of interest.
A set of appendices provides additional material, the
most useful of which is a listing of organization
addresses. My biggest complaint is the lack of an index
for a volume this large. As a partial compensation, the
table of contents is five pages long; however, it is impos-
sible to quickly find information such as where is Gary
Hendrix working (Symantec), which is available from the
text.
