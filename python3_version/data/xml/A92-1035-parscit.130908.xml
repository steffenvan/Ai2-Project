1 Why Does One Need a World Model?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994689933333334">
Practical NLP applications requiring semantic and pragmatic
analysis of texts necessitate the construction of a world model,
an ontology, to support interpretation of text elements. Con-
straints on world model elements serve as heuristics on the
cooccurrence of lexical and other meanings in the text, facil-
itating both natural language understanding and generation.
Propositional meanings (defined in the lexicon in terms of
links to the world model) trickle down to the text meaning
representation as instances of world model entities. Our pri-
mary objective in world modeling is to support multilingual
applications, so constructing a language-independent ontol-
ogy is crucial. The word sense view of ontology building
leads to proliferation of concepts whenever words in different
languages do not &amp;quot;line-up&amp;quot; (see EDR 1990), while using a
core set of &amp;quot;primitives&amp;quot; is limited for large-scale applications,
if shades of meaning are to be captured. In our environment,
concept acquisition is guided by examining cross-linguistic
evidence and representational trade-offs. In other large-scale
ontology projects, the separation of lexical from conceptual
knowledge is not always clear, as in the Cyc project at MCC,
a knowledge base containing millions of facts about the world
(Lenat and Guha, 1990), or the KT system (Dahlgren, 1988),
which classifies commonsense knowledge for English words.
In the DIONYSUS project at CMU, the world model, the lex-
icon and the text meaning representation are closely intercon-
nected, in terms of their content and format. World modeling
is supported by the ONTos system, which consists of a) a con-
straint language, b) an ontology, or set of general concepts, c)
a set of domain models and d) an intelligent knowledge acqui-
sition interface. The basic features of the ONTOS constraint
language are as follows (see Carlson &amp; Nirenburg, 1990, for
details). A world model is a collection of frames. A frame
is a named set of slots, interpreted as an ontological concept
(voluntary-olfactory-event, geopolitical-entity). A slot rep-
resents an ontological property (temperature, caused-by) and
consists of a named set of facets. A facet is a named set of
fillers. Facets refer to the status of property values, e.g.:
value actual values of property
(e.g., for concept instances)
default typical value of a property
sem set of &amp;quot;legal&amp;quot; values;
akin to selectional restrictions
A filler is a symbol, number, range, etc. A symbolic filler
(prefixed by &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;) names an ontological concept: (ALL (SUB-
CLASSES (value *property *object *event))).

2 Ontology Building in Context: Scalar
Attributes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999523">
In the ONTos system, a mechanism relating scalar attributes
(AGE, TEMPERATURE) to measuring units (TEMPORAL-
UNIT, THERMOMETRIC-UNIT) allows scalar information
to be converted into a standard format for interlingua rep-
resentation. The DOMAIN slot of a scalar attribute de-
fines the types of concepts the attribute can describe. In the
AFTRIBUTE-RANGE slot, the sem facet specifies an abso-
lute constraint on the range of numerical values the attribute
can have, while the measuring-unit facet designates a standard
unit for interpreting the constraint:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.97360175">
(AGE
(DOMAIN (sem *object))
(ATTRIBUTE-RANGE (sem (&gt; 0))
(measuring-unit *second)))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933105263158">
Ontology building has never been a totally independent
project in our environment. World knowledge in DIONYSUS
has been acquired with the express purpose of using it in a nat-
ural language processing system. Knowledge representation
requirements of such a system include, in addition to ontol-
ogy specification, a representation for a lexicon entry and a
language for recording the meaning of input text. The inter-
action between these static knowledge sources and a natural
language analyzer is illustrated in Figure 1.
World modeling decisions about scalar attributes are influ-
enced by the way the lexicon is built and vice versa. In
the DioNYsus system, relative scalar terms like very old,
or high/low are not given a separate ontological status. In-
stead, lexical entries for such words are associated with on-
tologically motivated constraints on scalar attributes. The
language-specific relationship between word-modifier and the
language-independent relationship between concept-property
is illustrated using the example offresh-brewed coffee. In the
ontology, the concept COFFEE appears as follows:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.9739365">
(COFFEE (value *beverage))
(IS-A (sem (&gt; 0))
(AGE (default (&lt;&gt; 0 4))
(measuring-unit *hour)))
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.980011">
The default facet of the AGE slot expresses a typical range
of values for the age of COFFEE, which can be overridden, as

lexical entries are represented in the lexicon entry format. 6, 7:

long as the absolute constraint is not violated. The measuring-
unit facet selects an appropriate measuring unit from the class
TEMPORAL-UNIT.
In the lexicon, the link between a word sense and an onto-
logical concept is established in the SEM zone of an entry (see
Meyer et al. 1990). In the simplest case, there is a direct link,
e.g., between the lexeme +cof f ee-n2 (the sense of coffee,
the beverage), and the concept COFFEE. However, adjectives
Ii kefresh-brewed, old, etc., which represent relative informa-
tion about age, are linked indirectly to an ontological concept,
via a constraint on the default range of the AGE property for
a given class of objects. For example, the SEM zone of lex-
ical entry +fresh-brewed-nl establishes the following
linkage:
instance-of: &amp;quot;COFFEE or TEA&amp;quot;
age: (range &lt; 0.1)
The range function calculates a default value for fresh-
brewed coffee, namely, less than 10% of the ontologically
specified default range for the AGE of COFFEE.
Lastly, we demonstrate informally the interdependence of
lexicon, ontology and text meaning representation in DIONY-
sus for the sentence 1 smelled the fresh-brewed coffee. First,
we identify the predicate-argument structure, and record the
syntactic pattern information in the SYN-STRUC zone of the
lexical entry for smell:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.753912333333333">
smell (the sense of &apos;voluntary perception&apos;)
entity that performs a voluntary
perceptual event: I (SUBJ)
entity that is the target of a
voluntary perceptual event:
coffee (OBJ)
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9963924">
Next, links between word sense and ontological concept
are created for the open-class lexical items in the sentence.
These links are recorded in the SEM zone of the lexical entry,
where a correspondence is established between semantic and
syntactic roles:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.521313">

VOLUNTARY-OLFACTORY-EVENT

THEME: PHYSICAL-OBJECT (^Svar2)
;links to the OBJ role
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.996179857142857">
The &amp;quot;$var 1 retrieves the meaning of the lexeme bound to
the variable $varl during syntactic parsing, places it in the
AGENT role of VOLUNTARY-OLFACTORY-EVENT, and
checks to make sure that the ontologically specified constraint
(AGENT: ANIMAL) is satisfied.
Finally, we illustrate the key components of the text mean-
ing representation for a sentence:

We have addressed some of the issues that arise when world
modeling is viewed as a component of knowledge support for
natural language processing. In DIONYSUS, the interdepen-
dence of ontology, lexicon and text meaning representation is
such that ontology acquisition never proceeds in an isolated
fashion. The discussion presented here regarding scalar at-
tributes is just one example of ontological decision making in
context. We would like to thank the members of the DIONY-
SUS projectâ€”Ralf Brown, Ted Gibson, Todd Kaufmann, John

In the simplest case, there is a direct link, e.g., between the lexeme +cof f ee-n2 (the sense of coffee, the beverage), and the concept COFFEE. However, adjectives Ii kefresh-brewed, old, etc., which represent relative information about age, are linked indirectly to an ontological concept, via a constraint on the default range of the AGE property for a given class of objects. For example, the SEM zone of lexical entry +fresh-brewed-nl establishes the following linkage: instance-of: &amp;quot;COFFEE or TEA&amp;quot; age: (range &lt; 0.1) The range function calculates a default value for freshbrewed coffee, namel</context>
