Seeking to develop the first satisfying univer-
sal definition of basic grammatical units of
the major syntactic categories such as &amp;quot;noun,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;verb,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;adjective&amp;quot; and of the principal
grammatical relations, &amp;quot;subject,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;object,&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;oblique,&amp;quot; William Croft employs the meth-
ods of cross-linguistic or typological analysis
and cognitive linguistics.
Drawing evidence from a wide variety of
languages, Croft shows that the traditional
semantic definitions for the major syntactic
categories (e.g., nouns denote persons and
things) represent the unmarked correlation
or &amp;quot;prototype&amp;quot; for the syntactic functions of
reference, predications, and modification.
Turning to recent work in cognitive linguis-
tics and discourse analysis, Croft argues that
the syntactic functions represent universal
ways of conceptualizing experience for the
purpose of communicating information in lan-
guage.
Croft then applies this hypothesis to gram-
matical relations between the verb and its
dependent subject, object, and oblique noun
phrases, arguing that one cannot account for
cross-linguistic patterns of marking using se-
mantic roles such as &amp;quot;agent&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;instrument.&amp;quot;
He proposes instead an &amp;quot;idealized (prototyp-
ical) cognitive model&amp;quot; of verb-meaning based
on causal relations among participants in the
action that human beings use in conceptu-
alizing events, which largely determines the
choice of subject, object, and oblique forms.—

How is one to represent the meaning of a
sentence such as Everyone who is actually rich
might have been poor? Cresswell&apos;s thesis is that
natural language is ontologically committed
to possible worlds, which play a similar kind
of semantic role to that played by times. In
particular, there are sentences that require
evaluation at a sequence of possible worlds
rather than just a single world.—G.H.

Editor&apos;s note: The following is excerpted from
Barbara Partee&apos;s enthusiastic foreword to this
book?
[This is] the first comprehensive introduction
to logic, language, and meaning that includes
on the one hand a very fine introduction to
logic, starting from the beginning, and on the
other hand brings up at every point connec-
tions to the study of meaning in natural lan-
guage, and thus serves as an excellent intro-
duction and logical background to many of
the central concerns of semantics and the phi-
losophy of language as well.
This book is pedagogically beautifully de-
signed, with the central developments very
carefully introduced and richly augmented
with examples and exercises, and with a
wealth of related optional material that can
be included or omitted for different kinds of
courses (or self-teaching) for which the book
could very well be used: I could imagine tai-
loring very fine but slightly different courses
from it for inclusion in a linguistics curricu-

lum, a philosophy curriculum, a cognitive
science curriculum, or an AI/computational
linguistics program. ... I think the authors
have done a superb job of combining peda-
gogical user-friendliness with the greatest at-
tention to rigor where it matters.
One very noticeable difference from famil-
iar introductory logic texts is the inclusion
of accessible introductions to many nonstan-
dard topics in logic, ranging from approaches
to presupposition and many-valued logics to
issues in the foundations of model theory,
and a wide range of more advanced (but still
very accessible) topics in Volume II. The book
thereby gives the student an invaluable per-
spective on the field of logic as an active area
of growth, development, and controversy,
and not simply a repository of a single set
of eternal axioms and theorems. Volume II
provides an outstanding introduction to the
interdisciplinary concerns of logic and seman-
tics, including a good introduction to the
basics of Montague grammar and model-
theoretic semantics more generally.
I first became acquainted with this book in
its Dutch version during a sabbatical leave in
the Netherlands in 1982-83. ... I started lob-
bying then for it to be translated into English,
and I&apos;m delighted that this has become a re-
ality. I hope English-speaking teachers and
students will appreciate the book as much
as I anticipate they will.—Barbara H. Partee,

&amp;quot;This book is an investigation into the se-
mantics of quantification and anaphora with
third-person singular pronouns. Our goal will
be to determine what consequences an ade-
quate semantic account of both phenomena
has for our general theories of quantification
and anaphoric relations. We will defend the
claim that the distinctions that need to be
made at the level of content are too rich for
a theory that attempts to capture quantifica-
tional and anaphoric ambiguities in syntac-
tic representations through such devices as
NP-indexing and tree geometry.&amp;quot;—From the

Mervyn Jack and John Laver have edited a
compact reference work that covers recent
core areas of speech technology. The intent is
to provide a critical tutorial discussion along
with a comprehensive bibliographical source.
At the time of publication (1988) the editors
and all the contributing authors were mem-
bers of the Centre for Speech Technology Re-
search at Edinburgh University.
The book has five chapters: two on speech
recognition, one on speech synthesis, one on
speaker verification, and one on helium
speech. All the chapters share certain excel-
lent qualities; they are well written, they give
extensive bibliographic support, and the au-
thors take the time to compare and evaluate
competing approaches. Each chapter presents
a balance of early and recent work and a bal-
ance of basic knowledge and applied prac-
tice. These are the strengths of the book, and
I would recommend Aspects of Speech Tech-
nology to an advanced student who was in-
terested in starting a project in one of these
areas.
I would recommend it, however, with a
word of caution. The two chapters on speech
recognition, which together make up half the
book, reflect the particular viewpoint that (1)
pattern matching using dynamic program-
ming techniques seems to be a short-term
solution that is inextricably linked to word-
based templates and therefore is not easily
applicable to very large or open vocabularies;
and (2) that we can anticipate the imminent
emergence of high-accuracy speech recogni-
tion systems that identify sub-word phonetic
units based on the kind of knowledge that
has been accumulated over the last several

decades&apos; work in acoustic phonetics. Even
by 1986 or 1987, it should have been clear
that there was no necessary link between dy-
namic programming pattern-matching algo-
rithms and closed vocabulary applications,
and that the prospect for high-performance
speech recognition systems based on acoustic
phonetic expertise was dim and getting dim-
mer. This renders the speech recognition por-
tion of the book somewhat less useful than
it might be. Still, one of the speech recog-
nition chapters offers an excellent review of
dynamic time warp (DTW) recognition the-
ory and practice, and the other is a wonder-
fully comprehensive review of the acoustic
characteristics of English consonants.—Jared

three things, namely machine translation,
computer-aided language learning, and the
relationship of those two areas to one an-
other and other relevant disciplines. As part
of this, articles will be presented that will ex-

examine current work in a light of critical

However, in saying this it must be noted that
there is also room for three other types of ar-

articles which set out to put a current issue in
a very firm context, providing a good, solid

&amp;quot;This book explores the hypothesis that natu-
ral-language expressions are organized along
a number of simultaneous informational
dimensions, in each of which the allowable
structural patterns form a system that can be
specified by a set of explicit rules. Each of
these rule systems, which we may call a com-
ponent, or module, is an autonomous gram-
mar of a single informational dimension, and
therefore, the organization of an expression
in one module need not correspond to its or-
ganization in another, though there will be
definite limits on the degree to which the
various autonomous descriptions of a sin-
gle natural-language expression can diverge
from one another.&amp;quot;—From the author&apos;s intro-

&amp;quot;We focus on what has come to be known as
logical, truth-conditional, or model-theoretic
semantics,&amp;quot; say the authors. This new text-
book covers: what semantics is about; de-
notation, truth, and meaning; quantification
and logical form; meaning in speech acts; in-
tensionality; indexicality, discourse, and pre-
supposition; lambda abstraction; word mean-
ing; and generalized quantifiers.

This is a dictionary for translation, not defi-
nition. Words and phrases are translated be-
tween English, French, and Russian, with
phrases being entered under all their signifi-
cant words. In all, there are 7697 entries, from
Abelian and aphasia through to vowel and zone
bit, covering terms from artificial intelligence,
automata theory, computational linguistics,
computer-assisted instruction, linguistics,
logic, machine translation, mathematical lin-
guistics, psycholinguistics, and many related
areas.
To test the dictionary&apos;s coverage, I tried
looking up all the technical terms from the ta-
bles of contents of a couple of issues of Com-
putational Linguistics. I was successful with
most of the terms, but found some surprising
omissions: pronoun, anaphora, phrase structure
grammar (not even phrase is given), and parse
tree (not even parse is given, though parsing
and tree are). — G.H.
