3.1 Introduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999442157894737">
The panel on concept extraction from natural lan-
guage text defined a variety of different views on the
problem at issue. First, we considered what would be
the properties of a very powerful natural language
understanding system which would serve as an ulti-
mate model for our deliberations, but was clearly not
achievable within the five-year time frame specified as
the primary area of interest to the Navy for the pur-
poses of this workshop. However, it could serve as a
goal toward which progress could be made in a series
of approximations, beginning within the next five
years and extending beyond.
The &amp;quot;ultimate&amp;quot; system we envisioned was a model
for understanding the text of scientific and technical
literature in order to discover technological innova-
tions, discern evolution of technological trends, and
predict where science and technology will evolve in
the future. Such a system would consist of two major
components:

1. Natural language understanding expert(s), whose
task would be to read and assimilate the narrative
text of scientific and technical literature.
2. Science and technology analysis expert(s), whose

function would be to evaluate the content of indi-
vidual articles as well as the cumulative contents of
the collection of scientific and technical materials,
and to identify trends and innovations, using mod-
els of current developments in science and technol-
ogy that define what would constitute an innova-
tion, a trend, etc., and that specify a variety of
other rather inexplicit types of knowledge used by
human experts to evaluate and predict.
With this lofty goal somewhat vaguely identified as a
Holy Grail for the future, we concentrated our efforts
on defining approximations to that goal, selecting as
our focus the military message analysis and routing
problem presented by NRL personnel as representative
of a particular set of problems the Navy is currently
attempting to solve. Within this context, the panel
addressed two types of development issues:

3.2 The Next Five Years
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999737">
In planning the evolutionary development of exist-
ing military message routing systems into more capa-
ble, knowledge-based systems within the next five
years, the panel considered a variety of techniques and
approaches that might be added to existing systems to
augment the current level of capability and &amp;quot;grow&amp;quot; the
system in the direction of a more powerful natural
language processing model.
There are two experimental development methods
which could be used to achieve this goal. The first
would be to begin with an actual operational message
routing system, install some version of this system at
NRL as an experimental vehicle2 and use it as a basis
to build on, adding the components which provide the
incremental capabilities discussed below, and systemat-
ically evaluating the effect of the additional capabili-
ties. An alternate approach would be to construct a
first stage experimental message routing system with-
out using any existing system as a foundation and
proceeding as indicated above.

3.2.1 First Stage: Add State-of-the-Art CL
Components
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994975">
The initial stage of improved capability can be
achieved by incorporating into the basic message rout-
ing system described above several state-of-the art
computational linguistic components which are almost
characterizable as &amp;quot;off-the-shelf&amp;quot;. Specifically, these
include a spelling corrector, a morphological analyzer,
and a synonym generator. The spelling corrector
would be of a type similar to the capability currently
available under the UNIX operating system, tailored
for the Navy message routing application (that is, in-
cluding a variety of Naval acronyms, relevant proper
nouns such as place names and ship names, and other
special jargon terms). Intelligent morphological ana-
lyzers have been built for a number of natural lan-
guage processing systems; these can be supplemented
by current non-numeric processing techniques for par-
tial match of character strings.
A synonym generator, on the other hand, while
well within the state of the art, still requires develop-
ment of the knowledge base of synonyms in some
manner. To illustrate, suppose that the system must
automatically produce for a user all the natural lan-
guage synonyms for the terms in a routing profile or
retrieval query of a user who wants all messages about
&amp;quot;military aircraft in the vicinity of the Red Sea&amp;quot;. In
order to generate the synonyms for each of those
terms (which users should then be allowed to prune or
supplement as they prefer), the system must either
have been primed beforehand by an extensive develop-
ment of a thesaurus-type knowledge base, or the sys-
tem must have an ability to acquire such knowledge
from users in an incremental manner (where the bur-
den of developing the knowledge base of synonyms is
mainly on the user), or a combination of both (for an
illustration of the latter, see Katter and Montgomery
1972).2

3.2.2 Second Stage: Augment Key Word Based
Concept Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982707207317074">
The second stage of improved capability in the
basic message routing system would be achieved by
augmenting the current key word base content analysis
component in several steps. It should be noted that
these steps are based on the in-depth analysis of mes-
sages and the routing environment described in Section
3.3, which should thus be conducted in parallel with
the development of the first stage improvements dis-
cussed in the preceding section.
2 The operational message routing systems described in foot-
note 1 allow users to develop synonym tables and utilize those
produced by others; however, these are not automatically triggered
when a routing profile is entered, but must be specifically requested
by the user.
Content analysis of messages based on key words
involves a rudimentary identification of concepts, with
no attempt to identify relations between concepts.
Thus a message reporting on shipments of cotter pins
from Cuba to Albania would not be distinguishable
from a similar one reporting on shipments of cotter
pins from Albania to Cuba. Consequently, the initial
step in augmenting the ability of a message routing
system to analyze the content of messages and extract
concepts from text would be the introduction of gram-
mar rules and a syntactic analysis component. A se-
mantic grammar approach in which the categories of
the grammar map fairly directly into user information
requirements ments would constitute a productive
initial capability. Such a grammar could be built along
the lines of the LIFER parser which was incorporated
into LADDER (Burton 1976) specifically to answer
questions about ships at sea.
A second development step in managing the evolu-
tion of a key word based concept extraction system to
a natural language understanding system involves the
construction of taxonomic hierachies which provide
the system with the knowledge to attempt rudimentary
inference, allow property inheritance, and exercise
some very simple analogic reasoning based on the
taxonomies. The work of Woods on constructing and
exploiting taxonomic hierarchies is illustrative of this
type of capability. The methodology used by SRI&apos;s
NANOKLAUS system for organizing knowledge has a
similar basis (Haas and Hendrix 1980).
A further enhacement would involve the utilization
of more general inference about the content of the
message (for example, rule based inference, where the
concept of rule includes frames and scripts as well as
production rules). Many messages relate information
about some particular type of event that has occured
many times before and will continue to occur, e.g., a
missile or space launch. Knowledge about the entities
and relations involved in such an event can therefore
be codified in terms of rules or scripts which explicate
the expected contents of a message. This provides the
basis on which the system can derive information
which is not explicity stated in the message and can
identify elements of information which are unexpected
or lacking. The experimental message understanding
system described in Silva et al. 1979 is an example of
this type of capability, as is the work of Simmons and
Chester (to apppear, 1982).
The final developmental level deemed to be achiev-
able within the next five years differs from the levels
previously discussed in that it incorporates one type of
meta-knowledge, that is, knowledge that is not con-
cerned with the content of the messages, but with the
goals of the recipient of the message. For example,
the recipient may have gotten the message simply for
information; on the other hand, the recipient may be

required to take some action on receiving the message
rather than merely filing it away, and the actions he
may take could be quite different depending on the
content of the message (e.g., information that an ac-
tivity has begun, or that an activity which has been
going on for some time is continuing, or has ceased).
Thus the consequences of the natural language under-
standing failing to identify the type of content and
causing the message to be misrouted can be quite seri-
ous in an operational environment.

3.2.3 Third Stage: Provide for Coping with the
Limitations of an Augmented Operational/
Experimental System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996129375">
Before the augmented message routing system
could be used even experimentally by persons other
than its designers, it must have the means for dealing
with its own inadequancies. Suppose the lexical
lookup encounters a word which is not in the diction-
ary, or the parser cannot analyze an input construc-
tion, even though all the words are known. Ap-
proaches to solving the problem of unexpected inputs
fall into two categories, and a robust system will incor-
porate some partial solutions of both types. The first
type of approach involves what heuristics and other
reasoning strategies the system can attempt without
appeal to the user; the second involves user interac-
tion.
What the system can do without appealing to the
user in the case of an unknown word ranges from:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.733902875">
1. very simple heuristics which assume a misspelling
and attempt to identify the word by partial match
strategies, to
2. the complex strategy of utilizing a protype knowl-
edge structure to deduce that the unknown word
must be an entity of type x because it fits an other-
wise unsatisfied slot in such a structure that re-
quires an entity of type x.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999740928571428">
Some productive approaches to handling structures
that are ungrammatical from the system&apos;s perspective
involve systematically relaxing some of the grammati-
cal constraints built in to the parser (e.g., subject/verb
agreement), as discussed in Weischedel and Black
1980.
In appealing to the user for assistance, a critical
factor is supplying not only the right information
about the particular failure, but the right amount of
information presented in words that the user can un-
derstand, and with suggested remedial actions that are
general from the system perspective, not confusing to
the user, and unlikely to elicit erroneous inputs. Ac-
complishing all this is a non-trivial problem.

3.3 The Next Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.933794555555556">
Assuming that all these thorny problems of the
message routing system to be developed in the next
five years are solved, the issue of managing the evolu-
tion of the last stage of that system into something
like the powerful natural language understanding sys-
tem described in Section 1 remains to be considered.
An important part of this evolution, which was
alluded to above, is the specification of the two major
components of such a system, namely
A. A Natural Language Understander, which will be
based on a model of the universe of discourse rep-
resented in the content of the messages;
B. A Message Routing Expert, which will be based on
a model of Navy organizational and functional
structure.
In the following discussion, Section 3.3.1 describes
the research tasks for component (A), while Section
3.3.2 treats the tasks for component (B).

In order to provide for the evolution of the system
described in the preceding section to a next genera-
tion, knowledge based message routing system — as
well as to furnish basic information for the develop-
ment to be achieved in the next five years — the initial
research task should begin immediately, and the sec-
ond research task should begin as early thereafter as
feasible. The initial five year development effort does
not depend on the remaining research tasks, which are
aimed at the next generation system. The research
tasks are described in the sections which follow.

detailed data on the content and format of the mes-
sages, that is, information about the lexical items, jar-
gon terms, classes of lexical items representing con-
cepts, the concept hierarchy, the types of relations
which can exist among concepts, the types of syntactic
constructs that those relations map into, and the dis-
course structures of different types of messages.

Selection of Knowledge Representation

Since this is one of the most debated aspects of
building knowledge based systems, it seems unneces-

issue will find Ron Brachman&apos;s SMART 1980 survey
one of the more interesting recent attempts to docu-
ment the thinking of various research groups on the
subject. Moore&apos;s thoughtful article on a theory of
logical forms for natural language expressions is re-
freshing in that it focuses on the content rather than
the form of knowledge representation (Moore 1981).

The development of a lexicon for the message sub-

common English words, but with quite different mean-

ers must be analyzed in order to furnish appropriate
input to the parser and other system components (e.g.,
&amp;quot;center spa 226k hawk 9 mi&amp;quot;). See the report of the

The inferential component uses the system&apos;s knowl-

■ goal analysis (analysis of goals of actors in the mes-

goals of the recipient of the message)
