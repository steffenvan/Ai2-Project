The sixteen essays assembled by Landow and Delany in this volume cover a broad
array of topics connected by a concern with &amp;quot;text-based computing&amp;quot; that have appli-
cations to the &amp;quot;humanities.&amp;quot; The unifying theme in the collection is, to a certain extent,
an attempt to assess the impact that the rapid proliferation of networked text corpora
and digital communications is having (or might have) in text-oriented disciplines. The
editors suggest that networked computing facilitates analysis of very large corpora, or
a docuverse (p. 23), which they contend is a vital component of research in the human-
ities. This does not mean that researchers can simply scale up their methods to meet
the demands and possibilities of new technical capabilities. Rather, they suggest that
humanists must
confront a boundless universe of text and ... draw from it elements
needed for a given project. ... [T]ext-based computing implies open-
ness to massive amounts of text and a recognition that we require
new procedures to keep from ineffectual wanderings in the labyrinth.
(pp. 23-24)
While the network opens up new resources and problematics to humanities schol-
arship, the editors are equally convinced that the &amp;quot;digital wor(l)d&amp;quot; is changing the
nature of scholarly publishing, communications, and writing. Thus, in addition to an
examination of computer-aided research in the humanities, Landow and Delany offer
essays looking at the pragmatics of electronic mail and conferences, the impact of com-
puter technology on writing, and how to navigate this new (should I say yet another)
&amp;quot;boundless universe.&amp;quot; As might be expected, the editors are only partly successful in
these ambitions.
The essays reflect a clear tension between describing the potentials (both method-
ological and theoretical) of this new networked universe of digital text and provid-
ing descriptions of the current state of the art in the humanities. For example, the
first essay outlines the TGB (Tres Grande Bibliotheque) effort of the Bibliotheque de
France, which envisages the digitization and electronic consultation of the holdings of
this great library. It is followed, however, by two essays describing commercial and
public-domain text management tools aimed at personal computers and workstations,
which provide little new information on navigating anything much more than your
own hard disk. Similarly, Jeremy Clear&apos;s discussion of the British National Corpus
or Paul Delany&apos;s personal docuverse bear little conceptual or theoretical relationship
to, for example, Ian Lancashire&apos;s very solid essay on Atwood&apos;s The Handmaid&apos;s Tale or

David Miall&apos;s proposal of computer-aided examinations of reader responses to literary
texts. The gap between current practice of textual computing in the humanities and
the &amp;quot;boundless universe of text&amp;quot; being deployed on the networks arises, to a certain
extent, from the fact that few scholars in the humanities have integrated networked in-
formation systems into the practice of computer-aided textual analysis. An important
part of the problem, however, arises from the fact that the digital wor(l)d challenges
the traditional notions of textuality that have informed the humanities.
In the paper world of the humanities scholar, a text is simply a fixed organiza-
tion of writing, often finding its limits at the covers of the printed volume. Landow
points out that text-based computing in the humanities relies on &amp;quot;electronic simu-
lacrum&amp;quot; of printed editions (p. 239) retaining the notions of textuality inherited from
print and paper. Delany, however, argues that &amp;quot;inside the docuverse world texts are
dematerialized—which means that they are freed from the constraints that accompany
embodiment&amp;quot; (p. 189). He continues by pointing out that the entire corpus of French
literature, held in the Tresor de la langue francaise database may be consulted as a sin-
gle entity or as dynamically defined subsets. In this context, the traditional categories
of text based on a title or an author are simply virtual subsets of the querying soft-
ware, which are equally as valid as subsets defined as &amp;quot;all the texts published in the
18th century&amp;quot; or all documents containing units identified as correspondence found
in novels and collections of letters. The distinction between text and context, in this
dematerialized environment, requires serious rethinking, since querying software so
readily shatters the traditional divisions. Furthermore, by discarding its paper referent,
Delany&apos;s dematerialized text can no longer be considered a simple typescript, repre-
senting the physical characteristics of a printed volume. Coombs, Renear, and DeRose
argue, in &amp;quot;Markup Systems and the Future of Scholarly Text Processing,&amp;quot; that digitized
text must be conceived of as a logical structure of textual components, which they call
&amp;quot;descriptive markup.&amp;quot; Schemes to represent the dematerialized text, such as the Text
Encoding Initiative Guidelines (based on SGML), make a critical distinction between
the logical content of textual structure and a particular instance of a fixed represen-
tation on paper. Thus, the docuverse dissolves many of the fixed points that guide
humanities research, by suggesting that particular instantiations of text are arbitrary
constructs. Alan McKenzie summaries the statelessness of the docuverse:
Electronic texts, having been rendered independent of ink, paper, agent,
and human memory, are always already in a state of excitement. They
weave their way along lines that are largely inexplicable and only
partly determinate. Texts that arrive over a network have no margins
to speak of; they present themselves to every gaze in a hierarchy yet
to be established, and even then they are infinitely subject to revision.
(p. 201-202)
If the digital wor(l)d has challenged traditional notions of textuality, it also by-
passes the established mechanisms of communications in the humanities. The explo-
sion of LISTSERVs and news groups dedicated to themes or issues in the humanities,
and the widespread distribution of electronic texts over the network, challenges the
notion of publication. Landow&apos;s essay on &amp;quot;Electronic Conferences and Samiszdat Tex-
tuality&amp;quot; is an important effort toward understanding the pragmatics and anthropology
of this new communications medium. Landow suggests that electronic conferences re-
tain the informality, rapidity, and spontaneity of oral communication, which results in
nonlinearity, democracy, and open-endedness—all good things, which, in Landow&apos;s
view, come at the cost of overwhelming masses of information and floods of verbiage.

The distinction between personal correspondence and publication, in this environ-
ment, break down completely, because postings to the network can have, as Renear
and Bilder suggest, extremely wide readerships. With democratization of communica-
tions and low-cost network publication come related issues of quality assessment, in
terms of the reliability of network resources (such as text files and databases) and the
caliber of discussions found on lists.
The main thrust of The Digital Word makes it an important collection for anyone
involved in text-oriented disciplines, for it is clear that computer-mediated textuality
in its many forms is fast becoming an issue for both critical research, by opening up
new forms of textuality, and the communication of research results. While not all of
the essays live up to this large task, the collection as a whole makes an important
contribution to understanding the implications and potentials of the digital wor(l)d.
