Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99989025">
A distributional method for part-of-speech
induction is presented which, in contrast
to most previous work, determines the
part-of-speech distribution of syntacti-
cally ambiguous words without explicitly
tagging the underlying text corpus. This is
achieved by assuming that the word pair
consisting of the left and right neighbor of
a particular token is characteristic of the
part of speech at this position, and by
clustering the neighbor pairs on the basis
of their middle words as observed in a
large corpus. The results obtained in this
way are evaluated by comparing them to
the part-of-speech distributions as found
in the manually tagged Brown corpus.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954714285714">
The purpose of this study is to automatically in-
duce a system of word classes that is in agreement
with human intuition, and then to assign all possi-
ble parts of speech to a given ambiguous or unam-
biguous word. Two of the pioneering studies con-
cerning this as yet not satisfactorily solved prob-
lem are Finch (1993) and Schütze (1993) who clas-
sify words according to their context vectors as de-
rived from a corpus. More recent studies try to
solve the problem of POS induction by combining
distributional and morphological information (Clark,
2003; Freitag, 2004), or by clustering words and
projecting them to POS vectors (Rapp, 2005).
Whereas all these studies are based on global
co-occurrence vectors who reflect the overall be-
havior of a word in a corpus, i.e. who in the case of
syntactically ambiguous words are based on POS-
mixtures, in this paper we raise the question if it is
really necessary to use an approach based on mix-
tures or if there is some way to avoid the mixing
beforehand. For this purpose, we suggest to look at

local contexts instead of global co-occurrence vec-
tors. As can be seen from human performance, in
almost all cases the local context of a syntactically
ambiguous word is sufficient to disambiguate its
part of speech.
The core assumption underlying our approach,
which in the context of cognition and child lan-
guage has been proposed by Mintz (2003), is that
words of a particular part of speech often have the
same left and right neighbors, i.e. a pair of such
neighbors can be considered to be characteristic of
a part of speech. For example, a noun may be sur-
rounded by the pair “the ... is”, a verb by the pair
“he ... the”, and an adjective by the pair “the ...
thing”. For ease of reference, in the remainder of
this paper we call these local contexts neighbor
pairs. The idea is now to cluster the neighbor pairs
on the basis of the middle words they occur with.
This way neighbor pairs typical of the same part of
speech are grouped together. For classification, a
word is assigned to the cluster where its neighbor
pairs are found. If its neighbor pairs are spread
over several clusters, the word can be assumed to
be ambiguous. This way ambiguity detection fol-
lows naturally from the methodology.

2 Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99153018">
Let us illustrate our approach by looking at Table 1.
The rows in the table are the neighbor pairs that we
want to consider, and the columns are suitable
middle words as we find them in a corpus. Most
words in our example are syntactically unambigu-
ous. Only link can be either a noun or a verb and
therefore shows the co-occurrence patterns of both.
Apart from the particular choice of features, what
distinguishes our approach from most others is that
we do not cluster the words (columns) which
would be the more straightforward thing to do. In-
stead we cluster the neighbor pairs (rows). Clus-
tering the columns would be fine for unambiguous
words, but has the drawback that ambiguous words
Proceedings of the ACL 2007 Demo and Poster Sessions, pages 53–56,
Prague, June 2007. c�2007 Association for Computational Linguistics
tend to be assigned only to the cluster relating to
their dominant part of speech. This means that no
ambiguity detection takes place at this stage.
In contrast, the problem of demixing can be av-
oided by clustering the rows which leads to the
condensed representation as shown in Table 2. The
neighbor pairs have been grouped in such a way
that the resulting clusters correspond to classes that
can be linguistically interpreted as nouns, adjec-
tives, and verbs. As desired, all unambiguous words
have been assigned to only a single cluster, and the
ambiguous word link has been assigned to the two
appropriate clusters.
Although it is not obvious from our example,
there is a drawback of this approach. The disad-
vantage is that by avoiding the ambiguity problem
for words we introduce it for the neighbor pairs,
i.e. ambiguities concerning neighbor pairs are not
resolved. Consider, for example, the neighbor pair
“then ... comes”, where the middle word can either
be a personal pronoun like he or a proper noun like
John. However, we believe that this is a problem
that for several reasons is of less importance:
Firstly, we are not explicitly interested in the am-
biguities of neighbor pairs. Secondly, the ambigui-
ties of neighbor pairs seem less frequent and less
systematic than those of words (an example is the
omnipresent noun/verb ambiguity in English), and
therefore the risk of misclusterings is lower.
Thirdly, this problem can be reduced by consider-
ing longer contexts which tend to be less ambigu-
ous. That is, by choosing an appropriate context
width a reasonable tradeoff between data sparse-
ness and ambiguity reduction can be chosen.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998916">
Our computations are based on the 100 million
word British National Corpus. As the number of
word types and neighbor pairs is prohibitively
high in a corpus of this size, we considered only a
selected vocabulary, as described in section 4.
From all neighbor pairs we chose the top 2000
which had the highest co-occurrence frequency
with the union of all words in the vocabulary and
did not contain punctuation marks.
By searching through the full corpus, we constructed
a matrix as exemplified in Table 1. However, as a large
corpus may contain errors and idiosyncrasies, the ma-
trix cells were not filled with binary yes/no decisions,
but with the frequency of a word type occurring as the
middle word of the respective neighbor pair. Note that
we used raw co-occurrence frequencies and did not
apply any association measure. However, to account
for the large variation in word frequency and to give an
equal chance to each word in the subsequent com-
putations, the matrix columns were normalized.

<page confidence="0.991958">

<bodyText confidence="0.999970222222222">
As our method for grouping the rows we used
K-means clustering with the cosine coefficient as
our similarity measure. The clustering algorithm
was started using random initialization. In order to
be able to easily compare the clustering results
with expectation, the number of clusters was spe-
cified to correspond to the number of expected
word classes.
After the clustering has been completed, to ob-
tain their centroids, in analogy to Table 2 the col-
umn vectors for each cluster are summed up. The
centroid values for each word can now be inter-
preted as evidence of this word belonging to the
class described by the respective cluster. For ex-
ample, if we obtained three clusters corresponding
to nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and if the corre-
sponding centroid values for e.g. the word link
would be 0.7, 0.3, and 0.0, this could be inter-
preted such that in 70% of its corpus occurrences
link has the function of a noun, in 30% of the
cases it appears as a verb, and that it never occurs
as an adjective. Note that the centroid values for a
particular word will always add up to 1 since, as
mentioned above, the column vectors have been
normalized beforehand.
As elaborated in Rapp (2007), another useful
application of the centroid vectors is that they al-
low us to judge the quality of the neighbor pairs
with respect to their selectivity regarding a parti-
cular word class. If the row vector of a neighbor
pair is very similar to the centroid of its cluster,
then it can be assumed that this neighbor pair only
accepts middle words of the correct class, whereas
neighbor pairs with lower similarity to the cen-
troid are probably less selective, i.e. they occa-
sionally allow for words from other clusters.

4 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884464285715">
As our test vocabulary we chose a sample of 50
words taken from a previous study (Rapp, 2005).
The list of words is included in Table 3 (columns
1 and 8). Columns 2 to 4 and 9 to 11 of Table 3
show the centroid values corresponding to each
word after the procedure described in the previous
section has been conducted, that is, the 2000 most
frequent neighbor pairs of the 50 words were clus-
tered into three groups. For clarity, all values were
multiplied by 1000 and rounded.
To facilitate reference, instead of naming each
cluster by a number or by specifying the corre-
sponding list of neighbor pairs (as done in Table 2), we
manually selected linguistically motivated names, namely
noun, verb, and adjective.
If we look at Table 3, we find that some words, such
as encourage, imagine, and option, have one value
close to 1000, with the other two values in the one
digit range. This is a typical pattern for unambiguous
words that belong to only one word class. However,
perhaps unexpectedly, the majority of words has val-
ues in the upper two digit or three digit range in two or
even three columns. This means that according to our
system most words seem to be ambiguous in one or
another way. For example, the word brief, although in
the majority of cases clearly an adjective in the sense
of short, can occasionally also occur as a noun (in the
sense of document) or a verb (in the sense of to instruct
somebody). In other cases, the occurrences of different
parts of speech are more balanced. An example is the
verb to strike versus the noun the strike.
According to our judgment, the results for all words
seem roughly plausible. Only the values for rain as a
noun versus a verb seemed on first glance counterintui-
tive, but can be explained by the fact that for semantic
reasons the verb rain usually only occurs in third per-
son singular, i.e. in its inflected form rains.
To provide a more objective measure for the quality
of the results, columns 5 to 7 and 12 to 14 of Table 3
show the occurrence frequencies of the 50 words as
nouns, verbs, and adjectives in the manually POS-
tagged Brown corpus, which is probably almost error
free (Kuςera, &amp; Francis, 1967). The respective tags in
the Brown-tagset are NN, VB, and JJ.
Generally, the POS-distributions of the Brown cor-
pus show a similar pattern as the automatically gener-
ated ones. For example, for drop the ratios of the
automatically generated numbers 334 / 643 / 24 are
similar to those of the pattern from the Brown corpus
which is 24 / 34 / 1. Overall, for 48 of the 50 words the
outcome with regard to the most likely POS is identi-
cal, with the two exceptions being the ambiguous
words finance and suit. Although even in these cases
the correct two parts of speech obtain the emphasis, the
distribution of the weighting among them is somewhat
different.

Of course, many questions are yet to be ex-
plored, among them the following: Can a singular
value decomposition (to be in effect only tempo-
rarily for the purpose of clustering) reduce the
problem of data sparseness? Can biclustering (also
referred to as co-clustering or two-mode cluster-
ing, i.e. the simultaneous clustering of the rows and
columns of a matrix) improve results? Does the ap-
proach scale to larger vocabularies? Can it be extended
to word sense induction by looking at longer distance
equivalents to middle words and neighbor pairs (which
could be homographs and pairs of words strongly as-
sociated to them)? All these are strands of research that
we look forward to explore.

Two of the pioneering studies concerning this as yet not satisfactorily solved problem are Finch (1993) and Schütze (1993) who classify words according to their context vectors as derived from a corpus. More recent studies try to solve the problem of POS induction by combining distributional and morphological information (Clark, 2003; Freitag, 2004), or by clustering words and projecting them to POS vectors (Rapp, 2005). Whereas all these studies are based on global co-occurrence vectors who reflect the overall behavior of a word in a corpus, i.e. who in the case of syntactically ambiguous words are based on POSmixtures, in this paper we raise the question if it is really necessary to use an approach based on mixtures or if there is some way to avoid the mixing beforehand. For this purpose, we suggest to look at 53 local contexts instead of global co-occurrence vectors. As can be seen from human performance, in almost all cases the local context of a syntactically ambiguous word is sufficient to disambiguate</context>

If the row vector of a neighbor pair is very similar to the centroid of its cluster, then it can be assumed that this neighbor pair only accepts middle words of the correct class, whereas neighbor pairs with lower similarity to the centroid are probably less selective, i.e. they occasionally allow for words from other clusters. 4 Results As our test vocabulary we chose a sample of 50 words taken from a previous study (Rapp, 2005). The list of words is included in Table 3 (columns 1 and 8). Columns 2 to 4 and 9 to 11 of Table 3 show the centroid values corresponding to each word after the procedure described in the previous section has been conducted, that is, the 2000 most frequent neighbor pairs of the 50 words were clustered into three groups. For clarity, all values were multiplied by 1000 and rounded. To facilitate reference, instead of naming each cluster by a number or by specifying the corresponding list of neighbor pairs (as done in Table 2), we manually selected linguistically motivated names, namely noun, ve</context>

For example, if we obtained three clusters corresponding to nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and if the corresponding centroid values for e.g. the word link would be 0.7, 0.3, and 0.0, this could be interpreted such that in 70% of its corpus occurrences link has the function of a noun, in 30% of the cases it appears as a verb, and that it never occurs as an adjective. Note that the centroid values for a particular word will always add up to 1 since, as mentioned above, the column vectors have been normalized beforehand. As elaborated in Rapp (2007), another useful application of the centroid vectors is that they allow us to judge the quality of the neighbor pairs with respect to their selectivity regarding a particular word class. If the row vector of a neighbor pair is very similar to the centroid of its cluster, then it can be assumed that this neighbor pair only accepts middle words of the correct class, whereas neighbor pairs with lower similarity to the centroid are probably less selective, i.e. they occasionally allow for words from other clusters. 4 Results As our test vocabulary we chose a sample of 50 words taken from a previou</context>

The results obtained in this way are evaluated by comparing them to the part-of-speech distributions as found in the manually tagged Brown corpus. 1 Introduction The purpose of this study is to automatically induce a system of word classes that is in agreement with human intuition, and then to assign all possible parts of speech to a given ambiguous or unambiguous word.
