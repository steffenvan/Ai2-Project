Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999867">
Call centers handle customer queries from various
domains such as computer sales and support, mo-
bile phones, car rental, etc. Each such domain
generally has a domain model which is essential
to handle customer complaints. These models
contain common problem categories, typical cus-
tomer issues and their solutions, greeting styles.
Currently these models are manually created over
time. Towards this, we propose an unsupervised
technique to generate domain models automati-
cally from call transcriptions. We use a state of
the art Automatic Speech Recognition system to
transcribe the calls between agents and customers,
which still results in high word error rates (40%)
and show that even from these noisy transcrip-
tions of calls we can automatically build a domain
model. The domain model is comprised of pri-
marily a topic taxonomy where every node is char-
acterized by topic(s), typical Questions-Answers
(Q&amp;As), typical actions and call statistics. We
show how such a domain model can be used for
topic identification of unseen calls. We also pro-
pose applications for aiding agents while handling
calls and for agent monitoring based on the do-
main model.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988260869565">
Call center is a general term for help desks, infor-
mation lines and customer service centers. Many
companies today operate call centers to handle
customer issues. It includes dialog-based (both
voice and online chat) and email support a user
receives from a professional agent. Call centers
have become a central focus of most companies as
they allow them to be in direct contact with their
customers to solve product-related and services-
related issues and also for grievance redress. A
typical call center agent handles over a hundred
calls in a day. Gigabytes of data is produced ev-
ery day in the form of speech audio, speech tran-
scripts, email, etc. This data is valuable for doing
analysis at many levels, e.g., to obtain statistics
about the type of problems and issues associated
with different products and services. This data can
also be used to evaluate agents and train them to
improve their performance.
Today’s call centers handle a wide variety of do-
mains such as computer sales and support, mobile
phones and apparels. To analyze the calls in any
domain, analysts need to identify the key issues
in the domain. Further, there may be variations
within a domain, say mobile phones, based on the
service providers. The analysts generate a domain
model through inspection of the call records (au-
dio, transcripts and emails). Such a model can in-
clude a listing of the call categories, types of prob-
lems solved in each category, listing of the cus-
tomer issues, typical questions-answers, appropri-
ate call opening and closing styles, etc. In essence,
these models provide a structured view of the do-
main. Manually building such models for vari-
ous domains may become prohibitively resource
intensive. Another important point to note is that
these models are dynamic in nature and change
over time. As a new version of a mobile phone
is introduced, software is launched in a country, a
sudden attack of a virus, the model may need to be
refined. Hence, an automated way of creating and
maintaining such a model is important.
In this paper, we have tried to formalize the es-
sential aspects of a domain model. It comprises
of primarily a topic taxonomy where every node
is characterized by topic(s), typical Questions-

Answers (Q&amp;As), typical actions and call statis-
tics. To build the model, we first automatically
transcribe the calls. Current automatic speech
recognition technology for telephone calls have
moderate to high word error rates (Padmanabhan
et al., 2002). We applied various feature engi-
neering techniques to combat the noise introduced
by the speech recognition system and applied text
clustering techniques to group topically similar
calls together. Using clustering at different gran-
ularity and identifying the relationship between
groups at different granularity we generate a tax-
onomy of call types. This taxonomy is augmented
with various meta information related to each node
as mentioned above. Such a model can be used
for identification of topics of unseen calls. To-
wards this, we envision an aiding tool for agents
to increase agent effectiveness and an administra-
tive tool for agent appraisal and training.
Organization of the paper: We start by de-
scribing related work in relevant areas. Section 3
talks about the call center dataset and the speech
recognition system used. The following section
contains the definition and describes an unsuper-
vised mechanism for building a topical model
from automatically transcribed calls. Section 5
demonstrates the usability of such a topical model
and proposes possible applications. Section 6 con-
cludes the paper.

2 Background and Related Work

<bodyText confidence="0.990408714285714">
In this work, we are trying to bridge the gap be-
tween a few seemingly unrelated research areas
viz. (1) Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), (2)
Text Clustering and Automatic Taxonomy Gener-
ation (ATG) and (3) Call Center Analytics. We
present some relevant work done in each of these
areas.

matic transcription of telephonic conversations is
proven to be more difficult than the transcription
of read speech. According to (Padmanabhan et
al., 2002), word-error rates are in the range of 7-
8% for read speech whereas for telephonic speech
it is more than 30%. This degradation is due
to the spontaneity of speech as well as the tele-
phone channel. Most speech recognition systems
perform well when trained for a particular accent
(Lawson et al., 2003). However, with call cen-
ters now being located in different parts of the
world, the requirement of handling different ac-
cents by the same speech recognition system fur-
ther increases word error rates.
Automatic Taxonomy Generation (ATG): In re-
cent years there has been some work relating to
mining domain specific documents to build an on-
tology. Mostly these systems rely on parsing (both
shallow and deep) to extract relationships between
key concepts within the domain. The ontology is
constructed from this by linking the extracted con-
cepts and relations (Jiang and Tan, 2005). How-
ever, the documents contain well formed sentences
which allow for parsers to be used.
Call Center Analytics: A lot of work on auto-
matic call type classification for the purpose of
categorizing calls (Tang et al., 2003), call rout-
ing (Kuo and Lee, 2003; Haffner et al., 2003), ob-
taining call log summaries (Douglas et al., 2005),
agent assisting and monitoring (Mishne et al.,
2005) has appeared in the past. In some cases, they
have modeled these as text classification problems
where topic labels are manually obtained (Tang et
al., 2003) and used to put the calls into different
buckets. Extraction of key phrases, which can be
used as features, from the noisy transcribed calls
is an important issue. For manually transcribed
calls, which do not have any noise, in (Mishne et
al., 2005) a phrase level significance estimate is
obtained by combining word level estimates that
were computed by comparing the frequency of a
word in a domain-specific corpus to its frequency
in an open-domain corpus. In (Wright et al., 1997)
phrase level significance was obtained for noisy
transcribed data where the phrases are clustered
and combined into finite state machines. Other
approaches use n-gram features with stop word re-
moval and minimum support (Kuo and Lee, 2003;
Douglas et al., 2005). In (Bechet et al., 2004) call
center dialogs have been clustered to learn about
dialog traces that are similar.
Our Contribution: In the call center scenario, the
authors are not aware of any work that deals with
automatically generating a taxonomy from tran-
scribed calls. In this paper, we have tried to for-
malize the essential aspects of a domain model.
We show an unsupervised method for building a
domain model from noisy unlabeled data, which is
available in abundance. This hierarchical domain
model contains summarized topic specific details
for topics of different granularity. We show how
such a model can be used for topic identification
of unseen calls. We propose two applications for

3 Issues with Call Center Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998820680851064">
We obtained telephonic conversation data col-
lected from the internal IT help desk of a com-
pany. The calls correspond to users making spe-
cific queries regarding problems with computer
software such as Lotus Notes, Net Client, MS Of-
fice, MS Windows, etc. Under these broad cate-
gories users faced specific problems e.g. in Lotus
Notes users had problems with their passwords,
mail archiving, replication, installation, etc. It is
possible that many of the sub problem categories
are similar, e.g. password issues can occur with
Lotus Notes, Net Client and MS Windows.
We obtained automatic transcriptions of the di-
alogs using an Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) system. The transcription server, used for
transcribing the call center data, is an IBM re-
search prototype. The speech recognition system
was trained on 300 hours of data comprising of
help desk calls sampled at 6KHz. The transcrip-
tion output comprises information about the rec-
ognized words along with their durations, i.e., be-
ginning and ending times of the words. Further,
speaker turns are marked, so the agent and cus-
tomer portions of speech are demarcated without
exactly naming which part is the agent and which
the customer. It should be noted that the call cen-
ter agents and the customers were of different na-
tionalities having varied accents and this further
made the job of the speech recognizer hard. The
resultant transcriptions have a word error rate of
about 40%. This high error rate implies that many
wrong deletions of actual words and wrong inser-
tion of dictionary words have taken place. Also
often speaker turns are not correctly identified and
voice portions of both speakers are assigned to a
single speaker. Apart from speech recognition er-
rors there are other issues related to spontaneous
speech recognition in the transcriptions. There are
no punctuation marks, silence periods are marked
but it is not possible to find sentence boundaries
based on these. There are repeats, false starts, a
lot of pause filling words such as um and uh, etc.
Portion of a transcribed call is shown in figure 1.
Generally, at these noise levels such data is hard
to interpret by a human. We used over 2000 calls
that have been automatically transcribed for our
analysis. The average duration of a call is about 9

We propose the Domain Model to be comprised
of primarily a topic taxonomy where every node
is characterized by topic(s), typical Questions-
Answers (Q&amp;As), typical actions and call statis-
tics. Generating such a taxonomy manually from
scratch requires significant effort. Further, the
changing nature of customer problems requires
frequent changes to the taxonomy. In the next sub-
section, we show that meaningful taxonomies can
be built without any manual supervision from a
collection of noisy call transcriptions.

As mentioned in section 3, automatically tran-

of feature engineering before applying any text
analytics technique. Each transcription is passed
through a Feature Engineering Component to per-
form noise removal. We performed a sequence of
cleansing operations to remove stopwords such as
the, of, seven, dot, january, hello. We also remove
pause filling words such as um, uh, huh . The re-

rithm 1) to extract the root form of every word e.g.
call from called. We extract all n-grams which
occur more frequently than a threshold and do not
contain any stopword. We observed that using
all n-grams without thresholding deteriorates the
quality of the generated taxonomy. a t &amp; t, lotus
notes, and expense reimbursement are some exam-
ples of extracted n-grams.
The Clusterer generates individual levels of
the taxonomy by using text clustering. We used
CLUTO package 2 for doing text clustering. We
experimented with all the available clustering
functions in CLUTO but no one clustering al-
gorithm consistently outperformed others. Also,
there was not much difference between various
algorithms based on the available goodness met-
rics. Hence, we used the default repeated bisec-
tion technique with cosine function as the similar-
ity metric. We ran this algorithm on a collection
of 2000 transcriptions multiple times. First we
generate 5 clusters from the 2000 transcriptions.
Next we generate 10 clusters from the same set
of transcriptions and so on. At the finest level we
split them into 100 clusters. To generate the topic

taxonomy, these sets containing 5 to 100 clusters
are passed through the Taxonomy Builder compo-
nent. This component (1) removes clusters con-
taining less than n documents (2) introduces di-
rected edges from cluster v1 to v2 if v1 and v2
share at least one document between them, and
where v2 is one level finer than v1. Now v1 and v2
become nodes in adjacent layers in the taxonomy.
Here we found the taxonomy to be a tree but in
general it can be a DAG. Now onwards, each node
in the taxonomy will be referred to as a topic.
This kind of top-down approach was preferred
over a bottom-up approach because it not only
gives the linkage between clusters of various gran-
ularity but also gives the most descriptive and dis-
criminative set of features associated with each
node. CLUTO defines descriptive (and discrimi-
native) features as the set of features which con-
tribute the most to the average similarity (dissim-
ilarity) between documents belonging to the same
cluster (different clusters). In general, there is a
large overlap between descriptive and discrimina-
tive features. These features, topic features, are
later used for generating topic specific informa-
tion. Figure 3 shows a part of the taxonomy ob-
tained from the IT help desk dataset. The labels

4.3 Topic Specific Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.922794509433962">
The Model Builder component in Figure 2 creates
an augmented taxonomy with topic specific infor-
mation extracted from noisy transcriptions. Topic
specific information includes phrases that describe
typical actions, typical Q&amp;As and call statistics
(for each topic in the taxonomy).
Typical Actions: Actions correspond to typical is-
sues raised by the customer, problems and strate-
gies for solving them. We observed that action re-
lated phrases are mostly found around topic fea-
tures. Hence, we start by searching and collect-
ing all the phrases containing topic words from
the documents belonging to the topic. We define
a 10-word window around the topic features and
harvest all phrases from the documents. The set
of collected phrases are then searched for n-grams
with support above a preset threshold. For exam-
ple, both the 10-grams note in click button to set
up for all stops and to action settings and click the
button to set up increase the support count of the
5-gram click button to set up.
The search for the n-grams proceeds based on
a threshold on a distance function that counts the
insertions necessary to match the two phrases. For
example can you is closer to can &lt; ... &gt; you than
to can &lt; ... &gt;&lt; ... &gt; you. Longer n-grams are
allowed a higher distance threshold than shorter n-
grams. After this stage we extracted all the phrases
that frequently occur within the cluster.
In the second step, phrase tiling and ordering,
we prune and merge the extracted phrases and or-
der them. Tiling constructs longer n-grams from
sequences of overlapping shorter n-grams. We
noted that the phrases have more meaning if they
are ordered by their appearance. For example, if
go to the program menu typically appears before
select options from program menu then it is more

useful to present them in the order of their appear-
ance. We establish this order based on the average
turn number where a phrase occurs.
Typical Questions-Answers: To understand a
customer’s issue the agent needs to ask the right
set of questions. Asking the right questions is the
key to effective call handling. We search for all the
questions within a topic by defining question tem-
plates. The question templates basically look for
all phrases beginning with how, what, can I, can
you, were there, etc. This set comprised of 127
such templates for questions. All 10-word phrases
conforming to the question templates are collected
and phrase harvesting, tiling and ordering is done
on them as described above. For the answers we
search for phrases in the vicinity immediately fol-
lowing the question.
Figure 4 shows a part of the topic specific in-
formation that has been generated for the default
properti node in Fig 3. There are 123 documents
in this node. We have selected phrases that occur
at least 5 times in these 123 documents. We have
captured the general opening and closing styles
used by the agents in addition to typical actions
and Q&amp;As for the topic. In this node the docu-
ments pertain to queries on setting up a new A T &amp;
T network connection. Most of the topic specific
issues that have been captured relate to the agent

we could not quantify our observation. However,
when we compared the automatically generated
topic specific information to the extracted infor-
mation from the hand labeled calls, we noted that
almost all the issues have been captured. In fact
there are some issues in the automatically gener-
ated set that are missing from the hand labeled set.
The following observations can be made from the
topic specific information that has been generated:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.908750928571429">
• The phrases that have been captured turn out
to be quite well formed. Even though the
ASR system introduces a lot of noise, the re-
sulting phrases when collected over the clus-
ters are clean.
• Some phrases appear in multiple forms thank
you for calling how can i help you, how may
i help you today, thanks for calling can i
be of help today. While tiling is able to
merge matching phrases, semantically simi-
lar phrases are not merged.
• The list of topic specific phrases, as already
noted, matched and at times was more ex-
haustive than similar hand generated sets.

<bodyText confidence="0.991764083333333">
Call Statistics: We compute various aggregate
statistics for each node in the topic taxonomy as
part of the model viz. (1) average call duration(in
seconds), (2) average transcription length(number
of words) (3) average number ofspeaker turns and
(4) number of calls. We observed that call dura-
tions and number of speaker turns varies signifi-
cantly from one topic to another. Figure 5 shows
average call duration and corresponding average
transcription lengths for a few interesting topics. It
can be seen that in topic cluster-1, which is about
expense reimbursement and related stuff, most of
the queries can be answered quickly in standard
ways. However, some connection related issues
(topic cluster-5) require more information from
customers and are generally longer in duration. In-
terestingly, topic cluster-2 and topic cluster-4 have
similar average call durations but quite different
average transcription lengths. On investigation we
found that cluster-4 is primarily about printer re-
lated queries where the customer many a times is
not ready with details like printer name, ip address
of the printer, resulting in long hold time whereas
for cluster-2, which is about online courses, users

We build a hierarchical index of type
{topic—*information} based on this automat-
ically generated model for each topic in the topic
taxonomy. An entry of this index contains topic
specific information viz. (1) typical Q&amp;As, (2)
typical actions, and (3) call statistics. As we
go down this hierarchical index the information
associated with each topic becomes more and
more specific. In (Mishne et al., 2005) a manually
developed collection of issues and their solutions
is indexed so that they can be matched to the
call topic. In our work the indexed collection is
automatically obtained from the call transcrip-
tions. Also, our index is more useful because of
its hierarchical nature where information can be
obtained for topics of various granularity unlike
(Mishne et al., 2005) where there is no concept of
topics at all.

ploiting this observation we do fast topic identi-
fication using a simple technique based on distri-
bution of topic specific descriptive and discrimi-
native features (Sec 4.2) within the initial portion
of the call. Figure 6 shows variation in prediction
accuracy using this technique as a function of the
fraction of a call observed for 5, 10 and 25 clus-
ters verified over the 125 hand-labeled transcrip-
tions. It can be seen, at coarse level, nearly 70%
prediction accuracy can be achieved by listening
to the initial 30% of the call and more than 80% of
the calls can be correctly categorized by listening
only to the first half of the call. Also calls related
to some categories can be quickly detected com-
pared to some other clusters as shown in Figure 7.

(1) a tool capable of aiding agents for efficient
handling of calls to improve customer satisfaction
as well as to reduce call handling time, (2) an ad-
ministrative tool for agent appraisal and training.
Agent aiding is done based on the automati-
cally generated domain model. The hierarchical
nature of the model helps to provide generic to
specific information to the agent as the call pro-
gresses. During call handling the agent can be
provided the automatically generated taxonomy
and the agent can get relevant information asso-
ciated with different nodes by say clicking on the
nodes. For example, once the agent identifies a
call to be about {lotusnot} in Fig 3 then he can
see the generic Lotus Notes related Q&amp;As and ac-
tions. By interacting further with the customer the
agent identifies it to be of {copi archiv replic}
topic and typical Q&amp;As and actions change ac-
cordingly. Finally, the agent narrows down to the
topic as {servercopi localcopi} and suggest solu-
tion for replication problem in Lotus Notes.
The concept of administrative tool is primar-
ily driven by Dialog and Topic level information.

for comparing completed individual calls with cor-
responding topics based on the distribution of
Q&amp;As, actions and call statistics. Based on the
topic level information we can check whether the
agent identified the issues and offered the known
solutions on a given topic. We can use the dialog
level information to check whether the agent used
courteous opening and closing sentences. Calls
that deviate from the topic specific distributions,
can be identified in this way and agents handling
these calls can be offered further training on the

6 Discussion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988882352941">
We have shown that it is possible to retrieve use-
ful information from noisy transcriptions of call
center voice conversations. We have shown that
the extracted information can be put in the form of
a model that succinctly captures the domain and
provides a comprehensive view of it. We briefly
showed through experiments that this model is an
accurate description of the domain. We have also
suggested useful scenarios where the model can be
used to aid and improve call center performance.
A call center handles several hundred-thousand
calls per year in various domains. It is very diffi-
cult to monitor the performance based on manual
processing of the calls. The framework presented
in this paper, allows a large part of this work
to be automated. A domain specific model that
is automatically learnt and updated based on the
voice conversations allows the call center to iden-
tify problem areas quickly and allocate resources
more effectively.
In future we would like to semantically clus-
ter the topic specific information so that redundant
topics are eliminated from the list. We can use Au-
tomatic Taxonomy Generation(ATG) algorithms
for document summarization (Kummamuru et al.,
2004) to build topic taxonomies. We would also
like to link our model to technical manuals, cata-
logs, etc. already available on the different topics
in the given domain.

These models contain common problem categories, typical customer issues and their solutions, greeting styles. Currently these models are manually created over time. Towards this, we propose an unsupervised technique to generate domain models automatically from call transcriptions. We use a state of the art Automatic Speech Recognition system to transcribe the calls between agents and customers, which still results in high word error rates (40%) and show that even from these noisy transcriptions of calls we can automatically build a domain model.

Automatic Taxonomy Generation (ATG): In recent years there has been some work relating to mining domain specific documents to build an ontology. Mostly these systems rely on parsing (both shallow and deep) to extract relationships between key concepts within the domain. The ontology is constructed from this by linking the extracted concepts and relations (Jiang and Tan, 2005). However, the documents contain well formed sentences which allow for parsers to be used. Call Center Analytics: A lot of work on automatic call type classification for the purpose of categorizing calls (Tang et al., 2003), call routing (Kuo and Lee, 2003; Haffner et al., 2003), obtaining call log summaries (Douglas et al., 2005), agent assisting and monitoring (Mishne et al., 2005) has appeared in the past. In some cases, they have modeled these as text classification problems where topic labels are manually obtained (Tang et al., 2003) and used to put the calls into different buckets. Extraction of key phrases, which can be used as features, from the noisy transcribed calls is an important issue. For manually transcribed calls, which do not have any noise, in (Mishne et al., 2005) a phrase level significance </context>

In some cases, they have modeled these as text classification problems where topic labels are manually obtained (Tang et al., 2003) and used to put the calls into different buckets. Extraction of key phrases, which can be used as features, from the noisy transcribed calls is an important issue. For manually transcribed calls, which do not have any noise, in (Mishne et al., 2005) a phrase level significance estimate is obtained by combining word level estimates that were computed by comparing the frequency of a word in a domain-specific corpus to its frequency in an open-domain corpus. In (Wright et al., 1997) phrase level significance was obtained for noisy transcribed data where the phrases are clustered and combined into finite state machines. Other approaches use n-gram features with stop word removal and minimum support (Kuo and Lee, 2003; Douglas et al., 2005). In (Bechet et al., 2004) call center dialogs have been clustered to learn about dialog traces that are similar. Our Contribution: In the call center scenario, the authors are not aware of any work that deals with automatically generating a taxonomy from transcribed calls. In this paper, we have tried to formalize the essential aspects </context>
