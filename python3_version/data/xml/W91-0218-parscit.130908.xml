This paper argues that there is no reason to distinguish between lexical information
and real-world information on the basis of the formalisms used; that both types of
knowledge can be expressed in the same formalism. However, it also argues that
there is information that is uniquely lexical in content, and this information consists
of verb- independent definitions for thematic relations such as cause and effect that
alter the representation of a verb depending on the presence or absence of certain
verb arguments.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999848590909091">
When considering the question of whether or not lexical information can be separated from
real-world knowledge, it must first be recognized that most lexical information in a natural
language processing system is expressed in terms of properties defined in a knowledge base
representing the domain model - i.e., the &amp;quot;world,&amp;quot; whether real or otherwise. For example,
semantic class constraints consist of properties such as animate or machine-part which
are associated with generic entities. Semantics is often described as the link between
syntax and the knowledge base, so by definition it must have one foot in the knowledge base
camp. In the absence of concrete examples of lexical facts or rules that are provably more
difficult to represent than real-world knowledge, it also seems reasonable to assume that
the knowledge representation formalism used for the domain model could serve to model
the associated lexical information. This is not intended to imply that it will be possible to
fully represent all of both types of information.. Formalisms for knowledge representation
have been acknowledged to be inadequate for representing real-world knowledge, let alone
lexical information [1]. It does make it especially burdensome to prove that a formalism
that is inadequate for real world knowledge is even more inadequate for lexical information.
The question remains, is there lexical information which is uniquely &amp;quot;lexical&amp;quot; in that
it can be distinguished from real-world knowledge albeit it may be expressed identically?
This paper argues for the affirmative response. Given the approach to semantic repre-
sentation implemented in PUNDIT and KERNEL [2], [3], [10] which is closely aligned
to Jackendoff&apos;s lexical conceptual structures [4], [5], it is argued that the definitions of
thematic relations such as cause and effect correspond to &amp;quot;uniquely lexical&amp;quot; items of
information.

2 Reviewing the effect definition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9850346">
It has already been proposed, [7], [9], that the thematic relation effect can be formalized
as a predicate which takes two arguments, an Intermediary and another predicate. This is
briefly summarized here. Examples of three verbs from a domain of pulley word problems
that include this definition in their lexical conceptual representations are connect, hang
and suspend.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997356">
2.1 Contact verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994575">
We will first look at attach and then contrast it with connect. An example sentence
from the pulley domain is A particle is attached [to/at] the end of a string. The final
semantic representation of this sentence needs to include a fixed, direct contact between
the particle and the end of the string. This is accomplished by mapping the referent for
thepartic/e, particlel, onto one Patient role, and the referent for the end, endl onto the
second Patient role in the following lexical conceptual structure: 1
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.918411">
attach-:
contact(Patientl,Patient2))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999735625">
The semantic representation resulting from this lexical conceptual structure becomes
contact(particlel,end1). At first glance, connect seems to be quite similar to attach,
but the possible inclusion of an Intermediary makes an important difference. Examples of
connect as used in the pulley domain include: A particle is connected to the end of a string,
A string connects two particles, A particle is connected by a string to another particle...
In all of these phrases, the final semantic representation should include a fixed contact
between location points on each of the two objects being connected to each other. In the
first phrase, A particle is connected to the end of a string, the particle and the end are
being attached directly to each other. In the second and third phrases, A string connects
two particles and A particle is connected by a string to another particle, the two particles
are being indirectly linked with each other by the use of an Intermediary, the string. There
is still a fixed contact involved, in fact there are two fixed contacts, but they are between
the particles and the ends of the strings, not between the particles themselves. This use
of a string as a Intermediary to effect a connection between two objects is captured by
the following general definition of connect which can produce distinct representations for
the different usages of connect given in the examples here.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.974745">
connect -:
effect(Intermediary),
contact(Patient I ,Patient2))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99830075">
Instantiating this definition by the referents to the noun phrases from A string connects
two particles results in:
I The use of standard thematic role names in the verb definitions is not intended to mislead the reader
into thinking that the arguments to the predicates correspond directly to traditional thematic roles. They
are simply arguments to predicates, and could just have easily been labelled Arg1 and Arg2, and have
been labelled as such in various incarnations. However, the author finds it difficult to keep Arg1 and
Arg2 straight, and has resorted to the thematic role names in the hopes of preserving some clarity around
which argument is which.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.973768">
199
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.8857085">
effect(string1,
contact(particlel,particle2))
At this stage, the representation does not capture the contacts between the particles
and the string. To achieve that it is necessary to apply the following linguistic definition
of the effect thematic relation that is independent of the verb, i.e., it applies to more
than one verb:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9402715">
effect(Intermediary),
Relation(Arg 1 ,Arg2)
Relation(Argl,Intermediary) AND
Relation(Intermediary,Arg2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9197096">
Matching this definition to our instantiated lexical conceptual structure from above
replaces the general Relation predicate with contact, Intermediary with stringl, Argl
with particlel and Arg2 with particle2. It results in:
effect(string1),
contact(particlel,particle2))
contact(particle 1 ,string 1 )
contact(string 1 ,particle2)
This demonstrates that the general definition given above, a classic definition of logical
transitivity (not linguistic transitivity!), can capture the essence of the meaning of the
effect thematic relation in that the Intermediary effects an indirect contact between two
objects by being in direct contact with each of them.
The principle difference between connect and attach is the possible inclusion of the
Intermediary. When the Intermediary in connect is not present, it is not assumed, and
the desired representation is exactly the same as the representation for attach. This can
be captured by a definition such as the one given below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.914454">
effect(absent,
Relation(Argl,Arg2)
Relation(Argl,Arg2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9969315">
Given our first example phrase, A particle is connected to the end of a string, the first
representation produced would be:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.549404">
effect (absent,
contact(particle 1 ,end 1))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9750295">
The application of the absent definition strips off the effect predicate, and the re-
sulting representation is identical to the attach representation given above, i.e., con-
tact(particlel,end1). This allows us to produce two quite different semantic represen-
tations for the different usages of connect in our example sentences. 2
2This would also be consistent with the view that the different usages are actually separate lexical
items, which should receive separate sematic representations, as in fact they do here. Then the principal

<bodyText confidence="0.995045">
The verb-independence of the linguistic definition for effect is substantiated by ap-
plying it to hang and suspend as described in the following section.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998079">
2.2 Support verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9713325">
Two principal support verbs in the pulley domain are hang and suspend which are used
quite similarly as in A particle is hung from a pulley by a string, Two particles are sus-
pended from a pulley. 3
The lexical conceptual structure for hang and suspend is similar to connect and is given
below:
hang -:
effect(Intermediary,
support(Patient, Source))
The first phrase, A particle is hung from a pulley by a string is treated almost identically
to A particle is connected to another particle by a string. The string is the Intermediary,
the particle is the Patient and the pulley is the Source, giving us:
hang -:
effect(stringl,
support(particlel, pulley1))
The same linguistic definition for effect is applied, this time to support predicates
instead of contact predicates, and the next stage of the representation is as follows:
effect(string 1 ,
support(particlel, pulleyl))
support(particlel, stringl)),
support(string 1,pulley 1))
In other words, the support of the particle is the string and the support of the string
is the pulley. The important point here is that the same verb- independent linguistic
definition of the effect thematic relation as a logical transitive relation that applies to
connect also applies to hang. In this case an Intermediary effects a support relationship
between two objects by being supported by one of the objects and in turn supporting the
other.
However, there are differences in how this definition is applied to the support verbs.
With connect, if the Intermediary was absent, it was assumed it did not exist. With
these support verbs, if it is absent it is assumed that it does exist. This is captured by
defining the Intermediary in the context of a support verb as an essential role whose
role of the lexical conceptual structure given here becomes that of determining which lexical items is being
used.
31n the pulley domain, the basic predicate for hang and suspend is actually location, and the presence
of gravity allows the support relationship with the corresponding upwards and downwards forces to be
inferred. This has been changed to support in order to focus the discussion on the transitivity issues..This
is not intended to imply that location would not be equally central to a more general definition of hang.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99612">

<bodyText confidence="0.992280857142857">
filler can be hypothesized [8]. This prevents the absent definition from applying, and the
same definition that applied in our first example also applies in the second example. So,
in Two particles are suspended from a pulley, the following instantiations occur, where
string57 is an hypothetical string whose existence is assumed
hang -:
effect(string57,
support([particlel, particle2], pulleyl))
This is expanded similarly to the expansion above, resulting in:
effect(string57,
support([particlel, particle2], pulley1))
support([particlel, particle2], string57)),
support(string57,pulley1))
This is intended to represent the information that the two particles are supported by
the string, and the string is in turn supported by the pulley.

2.3 Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998748">
This section has argued that the logical transitivity definition for the effect thematic rela-
tion represents knowledge that is uniquely lexical. It is derived from real world knowledge
and is expressed in the same formalism that real world knowledge is expressed in, but is
specifically concerned with the effect of the presence or absence of a particular type of
verb argument.

3 An extension of the effect predicate
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995117727272727">
This section extends the previously defined notion of the effect thematic relation as
summarized above by modifying it so that it can apply to the verb shoot as well. This
provides further evidence for the argument that there exists a category of knowledge
pertaining to the impact occasioned by the presence or absence of a particular thematic
relation and that this category of knowledge is essentially lexical in nature.
Standard flat predicate argument structure representations have had difficulty with
shoot:
John shot the turkey with a rifle.
John shot the turkey with a bullet.
John shot the turkey with a bullet from a rifle.
John shot the turkey with his rifle (of?) a bullet.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99523">
202
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999037333333333">
because of the complexity of the event (or events) being represented. It has been
argued that both a launch event and a contact event take place with the rifle being
the Instrument of the launch of the bullet and the bullet being an Instrument by which
John effects a contact with the turkey [6]. A general definition for this type of verb,
which might also provide a core representation for other meanings or uses of shoot as well
as similar verbs such as fire is suggested below. This definition makes use of an effect
thematic relation very closely aligned to the notion of transitivity defined above, but this
time used with a Propellant, the object being set into motion, as well as an Intermediary..
The central notion is once again one of logical transitivity, this time applied twice.
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.78931825">
shoot -:
cause(Agent,
effect_launch(Intermediary, Propellant,
apply_force(Agent, Goal)))
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.660099636363636">
Given the sentence John shot the turkey with a bullet from a rifle, John is the Agent
and the turkey is the Goal. The rifle is the Intermediary and the bullet is the Propellant.
This would result in:
shoot -:
cause(John,
effect_launch(rifle, bullet,
apply_force(John, turkey)))
This is intended to represent John as the Agent of an event in which he uses a rifle
(which propels a bullet) to apply-force against a turkey. The representation of this event
can be further expanded by the application of the following definition:
cause(Agent,
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.678335" genericHeader="method">
effect_launch(Intermediary, Propellant,
apply_force(Agent, Goal))) -:
apply_force(Agent,Intermediary) AND
apply_force(Intermediary, Propellant) AND
move(Propellant,Intermediary,Goal) AND
apply_force(Propellant, Goal)
apply_force(John ,rifle) AND
apply_force(rifle, bullet) AND
move(bullet,rifle,turkey) AND
apply_force(bullet,turkey)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975914">
These predicates represent John&apos;s application of force to the rifle, (by pulling the
trigger), which then applies force to the bullet. The bullet moves from the rifle to the
turkey, and applies force to the turkey. Similarly to hang, even if the Intermediary is
not linguistically realized, it still needs to be hypothesized, as does the Propellant. If the
minimal sentence of John shot the turkey is used, then the specifics of the Intermediary

<bodyText confidence="0.999878857142857">
and the Propellant have to be left undefined, but it is clear that some Intermediary and
some Propellant (perhaps a bow and arrow?) have been used. This is certainly not
intended to be a complete representation of the event - the trigger is never mentioned
explicitly - and may need to be modified substantially before it could be used. But it is
intended to support the hypothesis that logical transitivity, as an inherent component of
the meaning of the effect thematic relationship, adds a uniquely lexical component to
verb representations.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998296">
This paper argues that the definitions of the effect predicates presented here, as well as
the optionality or essentiallness of the roles , is a necessary part of the lexical semantics
of the verb, which may rely heavily on real-world knowledge about launching Propellants,
yet is still essentially lexical as evidenced by its being independent of the context. This
in turn supports the claim that, while lexical information and real-world knowledge may
share the same representation formalism, a distinction can still be maintained between
information which is fundamentally lexical in nature, and information which is not.

paper. I would also like to thank Alain Polguere for his comments.

Standard flat predicate argument structure representations have had difficulty with shoot: John shot the turkey with a rifle. John shot the turkey with a bullet. John shot the turkey with a bullet from a rifle. John shot the turkey with his rifle (of?) a bullet. 202 because of the complexity of the event (or events) being represented. It has been argued that both a launch event and a contact event take place with the rifle being the Instrument of the launch of the bullet and the bullet being an Instrument by which John effects a contact with the turkey [6]. A general definition for this type of verb, which might also provide a core representation for other meanings or uses of shoot as well as similar verbs such as fire is suggested below. This definition makes use of an effect thematic relation very closely aligned to the notion of transitivity defined above, but this time used with a Propellant, the object being set into motion, as well as an Intermediary.. The central notion is once again one of logical transitivity, this time applied twice. shoot -: cause(Agent, effect_launch(Intermediary, Propellant, apply_force(Agent, Goal))) Given the sen</context>

This has been changed to support in order to focus the discussion on the transitivity issues..This is not intended to imply that location would not be equally central to a more general definition of hang. 201 filler can be hypothesized [8]. This prevents the absent definition from applying, and the same definition that applied in our first example also applies in the second example. So, in Two particles are suspended from a pulley, the following instantiations occur, where string57 is an hypothetical string whose existence is assumed hang -: effect(string57, support([particlel, particle2], pulleyl)) This is expanded similarly to the expansion above, resulting in: effect(string57, support([particlel, particle2], pulley1)) support([particlel, particle2], string57)), support(string57,pulley1)) This is intended to represent the inf</context>
