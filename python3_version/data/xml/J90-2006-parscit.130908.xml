Book Reviews Modelisation du dialogue: Representation de l&apos;inference argumentative
2. Compare the rather amusing confusion produced by the most promi-
nent bibliography of the field published to date, Gazdar etal. (1987).
The book is called NLP in the 1980s on the cover and title page, for
The Outside World, so to speak. Inside the book, the list itself is called
&amp;quot;CL in the 1980s,&amp;quot; for The Inside World. In addition, it is computer-
accessible as CLBIB at Stanford, and letter mail must be sent to
CLBIB at the School of Cognitive Sciences, University of Sussex.

3. It is to be hoped that this tendency will continue to develop, similar to
the line of growing insight shown in the sequence of (titles of) books
by Nilsson: Problem-Solving Methods in Al (1971), Principles of Al
(1980/1982), and Logicdl Foundations of Al (1987, with Gen-
esereth).
4. In this survey of CL courses Winograd (1983) as the most frequently
cited reference, with 23 citations in 51 courses described as &apos;only CL&apos;;
the most frequently cited references in all 76 courses (including 25
described as &apos;courses with topics other than CL&apos;)-46 courses within
North America and 30 outside North Americaâ€”are: Winograd 30,
King 10, Tennant 8, Schank and Riesbeck 7 (Cohen 1986:4).
5. A quick sketch of the local context at our department: University
entrance level in Europe is in general considered to be equivalent to
American junior college graduation. Four years at a European univer-
sity are comparable to junior and senior year plus graduate studies up
to Master&apos;s thesis in the U.S. Students enter our seven-to-eight-
quarter CL program after at least one year study at a language
department, and they have to take (or to have taken) optionals for two
additional quarters. The core program in the first two to three terms
consists of classes in linguistics, formal logic, and computer science
(that is, introductory programming and an introduction to formal
languages and automata theory). Students used to take the Winograd
course at some point around the end of the core program and the
beginning of the advanced terms. We are currently engaged in
incorporating it into the core program (as of Spring 1990).
6. Setting aside the fact that ATNs are admittedly in decline, it is
surprising to see how the choice of a language can determine which
subjects to treat: see my previous remark on the differences between
the Prolog edition and the other two versions. Programming an ATN
in Prolog is not so thoroughly perverse as Gazdar and Mellish think it
is (p. 96), nor is it too difficult. Some of our students succeed in doing
so without much contriving, and it looks like really nice Prolog.

The other day a professor of linguistics told me about one of
his student&apos;s worlcs:&amp;quot;It is very mathematical but intelligent.&amp;quot;
If you want to know what this little but means, implies, and
reveals, read this book.
Jacques Moeschler, who is engaged in the linguistics of
French at the University of Geneva, offers a model for
recognizing and formally representing the structure of
dialogues. His work is a contribution to the insufficiently
explored field of discourse analysis in the original sense
of the term, that is, the analysis of oral conversation.
Moeschler&apos;s analyses are based on a corpus of French
telephone conservations and similar materials, but many of
his findings may apply even to the broader field of text
linguistics.
A special focus in Moeschler&apos;s argumentation is on the
ways that propositions are linked up to form a text or a
dialogue. Many text grammarians distinguish various kinds
of linkedness in dialogues (cf. de Beaugrande and Dressler&apos;s
Koharenz vs. Kohasion, 1981: 3ff). Moeschler&apos;s terms are
pertinence for the connectedness in the context and coher-
ence for the connectedness in the discourse situation. The
central element in Moeschler&apos;s reasoning, which gives the
book its special interest and also its individual flavour in the
current flood of text-linguistic studies, is the notion of
connecteur. To put it simply, such connectors are function
words or word groups that link up propositions logically,
temporally, or otherwise. Examples (which, due to their
very nature, normally cannot easily be glossed out of con-
text) are et, ou, ne pas, quand meme, and alors.
The theoretical background of the work is to be sought in
predicate logic and speech act theory. Among the major
sources are works by Ducrot, Austin, and Grice. The book
falls into three parts, of which the first is mainly dedicated
to a predicate-logical analysis of the meaning of connec-
tors. Although Moeschler pursues this analysis in much
detail, the main object of his analysis remains the word
itself, rather than some underlying semantic or logical
representation. To my personal taste, this is the most
important virtue of the book: Moeschler has understood
that human language is richer than formal representations
(cf. Schubert 1988a: 137-138). He gives this insight right
in the introduction (p. 10), stating that in natural language,
there are a large number of connectors that lack equiva-

lents in classical or nonclassical logical languages, and for
which a logical translation into terms of logical constants is
impossible (&amp;quot;ii existe un grand nombre de connecteurs en
langue naturelle n&apos;ayant pas de correspondants dans les
langages logiques classiques ou non classiques et pour
lesquels la traduction logique en termes de constante
logique n&apos;est pas possible&amp;quot;). With these words Moeschler
subscribes to the implicitness principle (Schubert 1988b),
which basically says that an artificial representation has an
inherently insufficient expressive power for rendering the
full and unrestricted content of a text in a human language.
Some of Moeschler&apos;s examples illustrate very well how the
content of connector constructions is impoverished when
rendered in predicate logic.
It would be a promising continuation of the work begun
by Moeschler if his connector analyses were applied cross-
linguistically and, in particular, in translation studies. The
implicitness principle shows that expanding the scope of
work in this way by no means requires any logical represen-
tation to be chosen as the main object of research rather
than the words themselves. On the contrary, a cross-
linguistic investigation of translation equivalences can, in
my view, profit from an approach like Moeschler&apos;s.
Part 1 of the book analyzes the logical content of connec-
tors, Part 2 discusses their function as markers of perti-
nence and, indirectly, of coherence, and Part 3 suggests a
tree-structured discourse representation. This representa-
tion might be seen as one of many (for an overview of text
models see Papegaaij and Schubert 1988: 13-14), if it were
not for the specific view on connectors that underlies
Moeschler&apos;s model. With the exception of a brief reference
to scripts, the book at first sight does not seem to have any
direct link to computational linguistics. Nevertheless, I am
convinced that a study that approaches language at the
grammatical and pragmatic level and leads toward a linguis-
tically motivated formalization is worth the attention of
computational linguists. I feel that materials of this kind
are needed on a much larger scale than is currently avail-
able, to let computational linguists&apos; skills in formalization
and implementation be applied on a pertinent linguistic
basis.

First, the form of the book: The Computational Linguistics
Handbook is very large. It contains 65 papers, organized in
12 sections, covering all aspects of computational linguis-
tics in the widest sense of the term. It has nearly a thousand
pages, most in two-column format, and weighs 2.2 kg. It&apos;s
probably the first book in computational linguistics to
include fold-out maps.
The book is in English and German: front matter is in
both languages, and articles are in one or the other (about
half in each language). One would have hoped that each
article would be accompanied by at least a translation of
the title and a short abstract in the other language, so that
the unilingual user could judge the relevance of the article
and possibly seek assistance with translation. But, unfortu-
nately, only titles are translated, and only in the table of
contents, not in the article itself. This makes browsing
difficult for users who do not have some facility in both
languagesâ€”and one of the values of the book is that it
invites browsing.
The book is properly typeset throughoutâ€”there&apos;s no
author&apos;s rough camera-ready copy hereâ€”which accounts
at least in part for its high price. Nevertheless, typos (or
copyediting infelicities) turn up a little more often than one
would have hoped. And on a couple of occasions, the
running heads are completely out of sync with the text.
Now the content: The goal of the Computational Linguis-
tics Handbook (pp. xivâ€“xv) is to describe comprehensively
the current state of research in the field, to survey the
literature, to locate the field itself with respect to related
disciplines and show its application in those fields, and to
suggest how the field may be further developed. That&apos;s a
big goal for a big book.
