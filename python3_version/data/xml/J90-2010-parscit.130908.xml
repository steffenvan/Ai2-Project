architecture that incorporates the design and implementation issues such
as flexibility, maintainability, and extendibility. The superimposition of
the KMS on an existing EMS provides flexibility, the loose coupling
between the KMS-interface components and the KMS functions
increases its maintainability, and the strong functional decomposition
and cohesion enhances the extendibility of the system beyond the scope
of its initial design.
Finally, the dissertation provides an implementation through the
development of a prototype KMS that involves users into the design
process through a validation study conducted at the University of
Arizona. The prototype used GDSS tools in eliciting message attributes
for the personal knowledge base. This method proved effective in
reducing the bottleneck observed in the acquisition of knowledge
simultaneously from multiple experts. Similarly, the combination of
observation with interviews proved effective in eliciting the
organizational knowledge base. The validation method measured the
system&apos;s accuracy (which was very accurate) in prioritizing messages for
the users.
This study was designed as a descriptive study to determine the extent of
use of expert systems in industry and to obtain quantitative information
concerning the present and future effect and utilization of expert
systems&apos; applications in industry. Data were obtained from the Fortune
500 businesses in the United States concerning their utilization of expert
systems&apos; applications.
Findings and conclusions. Even though respondents indicated
employment in relatively large businesses, according to annual gross
revenue and number of company employees, the majority of companies
spent less than $100,000 on expert systems development and
maintenance. Currently, low numbers of respondents are utilizing expert
systems&apos; applications, with diagnostics as the most often utilized
application. There is considerable difference of opinion regarding the
utilization of expert systems, the required expert systems skills of
existing employees, and the current expert systems&apos; applications in
various types of industry.
This work presents an analysis of English compounding that integrates
the advances of recent morphological theory with a detailed metrical
account of compound stress. It is argued that theories of compound
structure should be developed in tandem with explicit accounts of the
phonological behavior unique to compounds, and that this has not been
done adequately to date.
The phonological analysis is couched in a grid-based metrical
framework, and the stress rules are expressed in terms of
morphologically sensitive templates whose function is to augment the
lexical grids of compound constituents. Crucial use is made of the notion
of a general default compound stress rule and a limited number of rules
that can assign nondefault prominence in certain morphological
environments. A literature review and critique traces the treatment of
compound stress from the beginnings of generative phonology to the
present, and argues that the analysis presented here is the one most
consistent with contemporary assumptions concerning the interaction of
phonological and morphological rules.
The structural analysis is set in the framework of Selkirk (1982), and
synthesizes the contributions of Selkirk (1984) and Zwicky (1986), as
well as capturing heretofore unnoticed generalizations about compound
morphology.

The verb HAVE heads a diverse set of distinct but related syntactic
constructions in English. The dissertation shows how these constructions
are related to one another and how those relations can be expressed via a
multidimensional network of senses.
The distinctness of the constructions can be seen in a sentence such as
&amp;quot;I had my moped stolen,&amp;quot; which is ambiguous in three ways. We can
detect the presence of three constructions here by noting that the
ambiguity cannot be resolved either by making reference to different
constituent structures or by assigning different meanings to its individual
constituents (particularly HAVE). Instead, the semantic differences lie
at the level of the construction.
The inventory of HAVE-constructions includes the semantic subtypes
Causative, Resultant State/Event, &amp;quot;Depictive,&amp;quot; Attributive-Existential,
and Affecting Event. I show that these all instantiate a single
constructional schema, though they cannot be reduced to that schema. I
also show that the complex semantics of individual constructions is a
product of three dimensions of simple semantic factors: the semantics of
individual constituents, of constructions as a whole, and of the use of
constructions in larger environments.
This dissertation examines the role played by Discourse-linking in the
syntax of two types of multiple wh-constructions: multiple constituent
questions and questions formed by fronting out of a wh-complement.
Related explanations are offered for why Discourse-linking cancels
Superiority effects in the former and wh-island effects in the latter. The
account is worked out principally on data from Romanian, a Romance
language that permits multiple wh-fronting. Parallels are drawn between
the Romanian multiple wh-constructions and their counterpart in
English, where at least one of the wh-phrases has to stay in situ.
Chapters II and III offer a modular account of the restrictions on the
order of wh-phrases in Romanian: those at work in both echo and
standard questions are attributed to the ECP; those that constrain
standard questions only are attributed to a semantic/pragmatic
condition on questions, which requires them to be answerable. A
question is defined to be answerable if its presupposition is satisfied.
Multiple questions are shown to have a conditional-type presupposition,
in which the wide scope wh-phrase is associated with a universal
quantifier. This presupposition is shown to be satisfied only by questions
whose wide scope wh-phrase is Discourse-linked (e.g. which); hence, in
Romanian, the first wh-phrase, which is also the wide scope one, must be
Discourse-linked. A parallel account explains why Discourse-linking
cancels Superiority effects in English.
Chapter IV explains why only Discourse-linked wh-phrases can be
questioned out of wh-complements. Questions formed by such
extractions are shown to presuppose that the set over which the extracted
wh-phrase ranges has rnore than one member. If the extracted
wh-phrase is non—Discourse-linked, the set over which it ranges is of
nondeterminate membership; hence, in violation of the condition put
forth in Chapter III, it is impossible to tell whether the presupposition of
the question is satisfied and the question is answerable or not.

In the last chapter, Discourse-linked wh-NPs are assimilated to the
class of strong NPs. It is proposed that the definiteness effect that arises
in English existential sentences is a result of the interaction between
discourse factors and the nature of the determiner of the postcopular
NP.
The dissertation opens with a brief review of some of the influential
extant views of metaphor. The review shows where these different views
converge and where they diverge with respect to five fundamental
questions: Is metaphor &apos;linguistic&apos; or &apos;cognitive&apos;? Is metaphor &apos;special&apos; or
&apos;normal&apos; language use? What kind of associations are made among
words in a metaphorical expression? What is the importance of
metaphorical implication? Does metaphor create a &apos;third something&apos; out
of its basic terms?
The questions are answered after an investigation of many different
metaphors, using Ronald W. Langacker&apos;s theory of Cognitive Grammar.
In Cognitive Grammar, semantics is encyclopedic: words are
characterized with reference to cognitive domains. Using this notion, it is
a simple matter to show that metaphor involves the close and
unconventional associating of two different domains. It is hypothesized
in this dissertation that the making of a metaphor involves the formation
of a hybrid domain from the two (or more) domains involved in its
interpretation.
Evidence for the hybrid domain hypothesis is adduced from the use of
&apos;linking&apos; words such as is, of, make, his, and such in poetic metaphors.
Their standard semantics and syntax are not only retained in the
metaphor, but are actually exploited by the poet to bring together the
two concepts that s/he wants the reader to associate. More evidence is
found in the metaphors of everyday speech, such as ARGUMENT IS
WAR and LANGUAGE IS A CONDUIT. In these metaphorical
systems, it is possible to come up with &apos;ungrammatical&apos; metaphors,
which implies that there is some conventionally limited domain
characterizing the expressions of the metaphor in a quasi-literal way.
The original questions are answered in the following way:
apprehension of metaphor is not confined to language use, but is a
normal part of cognition. Within language, metaphor is
phenomenologically and syntactically normal: sometimes, and to varying
degrees, it is semantically bizarre. Implication is a defining
characteristic of poetic metaphor. If there is a &apos;third something&apos; created
by metaphor, it might be described as a hybrid domain.
Comprehension of metaphor in preschoolers was studied through an
elicited repetition task. Subjects were 52 children ages 3;0 to 5;2.
Repetition performance on metaphors was compared with repetitions of
semantically well-formed literal sentences as well as semantically
anomalous sentences, all matched for length, vocabulary, and sentence
structure. Accuracy on literal and metaphoric stimuli were comparable,
and both were significantly better than performance on anomalous
sentences. There were no effects for age or sex. It was shown that the
metaphors were not semantically anomalous to the children and that
they were processed on a par with literal language. The argument is
advanced from a review of the literature that imitation implicates
understanding of the material imitated.
If metaphor is thus shown to emerge early in the child&apos;s linguistic
repertory, figurative language, it may be argued, occupies a more central
position in linguistic theory than it has been accorded.
The implications of this reassessment of the role of figurative language
were examined in the framework of the philosophy of language and of

computational linguistics, and the argument for a dynamic lexicon was
put forward.
The many-to-many relation that holds between morphosyntactic form
and communicative function has long been noted by linguists and
philosophers interested in language use. A single communicative
function can be realized by many different syntactic forms, and a single
syntactic form can realize several different functions in the appropriate
discourse contexts. The production and interpretation of utterances with
regard to function, then, is a problematic issue that requires some
explanation. In other words, how do speakers know how to encode the
messages they intend, and how do recipients interpret those messages
correctly with regard to their function? The present study will address
this issue by examining the role of morphosyntax in the interpretation of
declarative and nonclausal questions in English conversation.
While interrogative forms are typically associated with question
function, declarative and nonclausal questions are not uncommon in
conversation. On the basis of the literature, one can assume that these
so-called atypical questions do not correlate regularly with
morphosyntactic markers associated with question function. The
literature clearly maintains that such correlations do not exist and treats
that lack as a problematic issue. An examination of naturally occurring
conversational discourse reveals, however, that nontypical question
forms do correlate regularly with morphosyntactic markers associated
with question function. Moreover, morphosyntactic form correlates with
communicative function on two different levels of analysis. The
correlation exists at the general functional level of doing questioning. It
also exists at a level of more subtle functional analysis, i.e., a level at
which specific functional types of questions are described. In other
words, declarative clauses and nonclausal forms correlate with different
kinds of specific functional types of questions. The form/function
correlations that are exhibited in this study are not arbitrary. It is shown
that the specific patterns of morphosyntactic marking that characterize
declarative and nonclausal questions respectively are functionally
motivated. This study shows that morphosyntactic form correlates
strongly with both question function in general and more specific
functional types of questions. In the light of the correlations of
declarative and nonclausal forms with specific question types, it is clear
that further elaboration of discourse function is required for statements
of typicality with regard to doing questioning in conversation. The
form/function correlations exhibited in this work have significant
implications for language processing (interpretation), language
acquisition (learning), and the study of language universals.
The goal of this dissertation is to argue for a prosodic hierarchy with the
mora, rather than the syllable, as its lowest unit. This idea is developed
within the framework of lexical phonology and morphology, which
includes rules and constraints pertinent to prosodic structure.
The arguments for the prosodic status of the mora are presented in
two steps. First, it is shown that the mora should be assigned the status
of a primitive constituent in subsyllabic structure. This argument is
based on the difference in sonority requirements on moras and on
syllables. The standard assumption is that, if we think of segment
inventories in terms of a sonority scale, syllabic segments, constituting
the leftmost mora of a syllable, are a subset of the entire segment
inventory. In this dissertation it is shown that segments constituting the
rightmost mora, henceforth moraic segments, are also a subset of the
entire segment inventory. These two subsets are in fact independent of

each other, and are determined on a language-particular basis. However,
they stand in a fixed mutual relation: syllabic segments are always a
subset of moraic segments. The subset relation between the syllabic and
the moraic segments follows, as a necessary consequence of the
representation of subsyllabic metrical structure with the mora as its
primitive constituent.
The generalization about the two subsets of the segment inventory has
the following desirable consequences: first, it establishes a range of
possible language types. Second, it gives rise to various implicational
relations between the possible types of closed syllables on the one hand,
and the possible types of heavy syllables on the other. One such relation
is Trubetzkoy&apos;s generalization about the implicational relation between
CVV and CVC syllables.
Taking as a point of departure the independence of moraic and
syllabic structure, two algorithms are proposed for building prosodic
structure: one that creates moras, and one that groups moras into
syllables. From this can be derived both the curvelike sonority properties
of the syllable and the sonority constraints that hold between adjacent
syllables.
The second step of the argument is a demonstration of the prosodic
status of the mora, in the role of a prosodic licenser. The crucial evidence
consists of cases with a simultaneous requirement for the presence of
moraic structure and the absence of syllabic structure, as in Bulgarian
and Serbo-Croatian.

This thesis seeks to develop the account of natural language semantics
found in the work of Donald Davidson. Special attention is given to the
empirical character of theories of meaning, and Quine&apos;s theses of
translational and referential indeterminacy are examined for their
bearing on this. It is argued that a strict form of Davidson&apos;s principle of
charity plays the essential role in making these theories empirical. The
formal modifications Davidson makes to Tarski in the course of
structuring theories of meaning after Tarskian theories of truth are
identified, and a modified version of Convention T is provided. On the
basis of the account of interpretation thus developed, the case is made
that Davidson&apos;s argument against global skepticism is inadequate unless
supplemented with his argument against incommensurable conceptual
schemes. This latter argument is defended as being an argument for a
notion of objectivity that rules out any interesting sort of correspondence
theory of truth.
Six studies examine conversational structure by applying a pragmatic
analysis to two-party conversations. In Study IA, a subgoal achievement
label was applied to each talking turn of 93 automatically tape-recorded
telephone conversations between native English-speaking beauty salon
receptionists and one confederate female caller trained to play a
standardized, nonleading role in getting an appointment for a haircut.
Chi square tests showed that these conversations have a subgoal
structure and that some structures are more prevalent than others.
Regularities were attributed to social and organizational problems that
appointment-making presents.
Study IB obtained acceptable inter-rater reliability values of the
Study IA structural assignments using a trained independent male
observer whose agreement with the researcher was assessed.
Study IIA failed to provide evidence for knowledge of conversational
subgoal structure among 83 female native English speakers who
attempted to resequence two transcribed and scrambled Study I
conversations.

In Study IIB, 53 native English-speaking females rated three versions
of both Study HA conversations for naturalness. Chi square tests
confirmed that the subjects could reliably select the naturally occurring
ones. The results are attributed to successful engagement of knowledge
about conversational subgoal structure.
In a test of the methodological and theoretical generalizability of
Study IA, Study MA applied the subgoal structural analysis developed
in Study IA to a set of 59 recorded telephone appointment-making
conversations between acquaintances collected from one beauty salon.
Chi square tests demonstrated that subgoal structure exists within this
set and that some structures occur more frequently than others. These
results confirmed predictions from Study IA data. Those predictions
were based on the idea that conversational regularities are due to the
operation of social and organizational factors that influence
conversational goal pursuit.
Study IIIB generated inter-rater reliability values for the Study IIIA
structural assignments using the same trained independent observer
from Study IB. High levels of agreement were obtained.
Overall, the research supported the conclusion that it is meaningful
and useful to view conversations and the knowledge conversationalists
have of them from a pragmatic perspective. A variety of extensions of
this research are discussed.

The purpose of this dissertation is to determine where grammatical
intuitions come from. Grammatical intuitions have been considered a
valuable source of data for both linguists and psychologists, but there
has been some division over the source of these intuitions and the
existence of a distinct level of syntactic representation. What position is
adopted depends on which of two general theories of sentence
comprehension one favors. In one class of theories, called syntax explicit,
an autonomous syntactic representation is constructed prior to the
processing of semantic information. The second class of theories, called
syntax implicit, suggest that no distinct syntactic representation is
constructed, but rather that a semantic representation of the sentences
meaning is constructed.
A detailed syntax implicit spreading activation theory of sentence
comprehension is proposed, based on the Logogen model of word
recognition, and a number of clearly testable empirical predictions
concerning grammatical intuitions are derived from the theory. The five
experiments, in which subjects were asked to provide acceptability
ratings for different types of sentences, fragments, and ungrammatical
strings, provide data testing these predictions.
The results support the theory proposed, indicating that several kinds
of information besides syntactic relations are incorporated into subjects&apos;
grammatical intuitions, and suggesting that a separate syntactic
representation is unnecessary as an explanation of grammatical
intuition. Finally, these theories are discussed in light of other general
theories of sentence comprehension and cognition.
