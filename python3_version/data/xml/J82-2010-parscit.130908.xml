</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9993744">
• syntax, parsing, and language generation, includ-
ing aspects of linguistic theories relevant to com-
putational models,
• computational semantics, including logic, refer-
ence, anaphora, and metaphor,
• discourse analysis and speech acts,
• representation of knowledge, deduction, and plan-
ning as related to language understanding or
production,
• speech analysis and synthesis,
• machine translation, machine-aided translation,
and automated dictionaries,
• formal foundations of computational linguistics,

<bodyText confidence="0.966398012987013">
An author wishing to present a paper should submit
six copies of a five to eight page summary, double-
spaced, by February 1, 1983 to: Mitchell Marcus,
2D-443, Bell Laboratories, 600 Mountain Avenue,
Murray Hill, New Jersey, 07974 [phone: (201) 582-
3948].
It is important that the summary contain sufficient
information, including references to relevant literature,
to convey the new ideas and allow the program com-
mittee to determine the scope of the work. Authors
should clearly indicate to what extent the work is com-
plete and, if relevant, to what extent it has been im-
plemented. A summary exceeding eight double-spaced
pages in length may not receive the attention it de-
serves.
All submissions will be read by the program com-
mittee, which is chaired by Mitchell Marcus, Bell Lab-
oratories, and consists of Philip Cohen, Fairchild Cam-
era and Instrument Corp., Lauri Karttunen, University
of Texas, Austin, William Mann, USC/ Information
Sciences Institute, Robert Moore, SRI International,
Ann Robinson, Symantec, and Robert Wilensky, Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley.
Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their
papers by March 7, 1983. Full-length versions of
accepted papers submitted by April 18, 1983 will be
included in the Proceedings of the Conference.
Local arrangements are being handled by Jonathan
Allen, Department of Electrical Engineering and Com-
puter Science, MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139
[phone: (617) 253-2509; ARPANET: ja@mit-ai].
For other information regarding the annual meet-
ing, contact: Don Walker (ACL), Artificial Intelli-
gence Center, SRI International EJ278, Menlo Park,
California, 94025 [phone: (415) 859-3071; ARPAN-

Call for Papers - IJCAI-83
The Eighth International Joint Conference on Arti-
ficial Intelligence, IJCAI-83, will be held in Karlsruhe,
West Germany, on August 8-12, 1983. There will also
be a two-day Tutorial Program from AISB and GI on
August 7 and 8, 1983.
The IJCAI conferences are the main forum for the
presentation of Artificial Intelligence research to an
international audience. The goal of IJCAI-83 is to
promote scientific interchange, within and between all
subfields of Artificial Intelligence, among researchers
from all over the world. The conference is sponsored
by International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelli-
gence, Inc., and co-sponsored by Gesellschaft fiir In-
formatik (West Germany), the Society for the Study of
Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour
(Britain), and Nederlandse Vereniging voor kunstma-
tige Intelligentie (The Netherlands).
Papers concerning all aspects of Artificial Intelli-
gence will be considered. Complete drafts, in English,
should be received by the program chairman by Febru-
ary 1, 1983. Final versions of accepted papers will
appear in the conference proceedings.
The refereeing and the sessions will be organized
around the following subfields: Automatic Program-
ming, Cognitive Modelling, Expert Systems, Knowl-
edge Representation, Learning and Knowledge Acqui-
sition, Logic Programming, Natural Language, Plan-
ning and Search, Robotics, System Support, Theorem
Proving, and Vision.
In addition to the contributed papers, the program
will include several invited papers, panel discussions,
and special interest sessions. Suggestions for these
should be sent to the program chairman.
The conference will also include program demon-
strations and exhibits. Submissions and requests in
these categories should be directed to the local ar-
rangements chairmen. Program demonstrations will
not be refereed.
Submissions to the technical program and program
enquiries should be sent to the program chairman:

ACL Book Series
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99070605882353">
A new book series has been announced by the
Cambridge University Press. It is entitled Studies in
Natural Language Processing, and has Aravind K. Joshi
as the General Editor.
The Association for Computational Linguistics is
sponsoring this series of monographs, texts, and col-
lections of papers on scientific and scholarly topics
which represent the range of professional activity of
concern to its membership. Methods of investigation
include the algorithmic, mathematical, and heuristic
methods of formal linguistics and artificial intelligence,
and the experimental methods of cognitive psychology
and psycholinguistics.
It is anticipated that books to appear in the series
will be of three general types: research monographs,
textbooks, and collections of papers. Research mono-
graphs, aimed at the professional reader, will be de-
tailed reports of significant research projects or litera-
ture reviews of a size beyond the compass of a journal
article. Appropriately revised doctoral dissertations of
particularly high quality may be considered for inclu-
sion in the series in this category.
Courses in computational linguistics are becoming
increasingly common in departments of linguistics and
computer science, and there are so far few, if any,
suitable textbooks. Students must rely largely on scat-
tered journal articles and instructors&apos; lectures. Propos-
als for texts by authors of established reputations in
the field will be entertained. A text might be in the
nature of a general survey, or might concentrate on
one of the major subareas of research.
The third category of books will be collections of
papers. These will in no case be proceedings of gener-
al meetings or otherwise heterogeneous collections.
Rather, each will be a thematically coherent set of
research reports bearing on a single, well-defined topic
of current significance, assembled under strong direc-
tion and control by an editor or editors who will be
responsible for the quality of all the contents, and who
will provide a unifying introduction. Such a collection
might result from a symposium on a particular topic,
to which the participants submit written papers. Or
chapters on various aspects of important problems in a
particular area may be especially commissioned by a
volume editor. Collections of already-published pa-
pers, in cases where the subject is a major and signifi-
cant one, the papers represent definitive treatments of
particular approaches to it, and the papers are in scat-
tered and perhaps not readily available sources, may
occasionally be considered.
The Editorial Board for the series consists of: Jona-
