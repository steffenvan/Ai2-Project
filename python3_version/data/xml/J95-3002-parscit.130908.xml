Statistical approaches to natural language processing generally obtain the parameters by using the
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method. The MLE approaches, however, may fail to achieve
good performance in difficult tasks, because the discrimination and robustness issues are not taken
into consideration in the estimation processes. Motivated by that concern, a discrimination- and
robustness-oriented learning algorithm is proposed in this paper for minimizing the error rate. In
evaluating the robust learning procedure on a corpus of 1,000 sentences, 64.3% of the sentences
are assigned their correct syntactic structures, while only 53.1% accuracy rate is obtained with
the MLE approach.
In addition, parameters are usually estimated poorly when the training data is sparse. Smooth-
ing the parameters is thus important in the estimation process. Accordingly, we use a hybrid
approach combining the robust learning procedure with the smoothing method. The accuracy rate
of 69.8% is attained by using this approach. Finally, a parameter tying scheme is proposed to
tie those highly correlated but unreliably estimated parameters together so that the parameters
can be better trained in the learning process. With this tying scheme, the number of parameters
is reduced by a factor of 2,000 (from 8.7 x 108 to 4.2 x 105), and the accuracy rate for parse
tree selection is improved up to 70.3% when the robust learning procedure is applied on the tied
parameters.

Resolution of syntactic ambiguity has been a focus in the field of natural language
processing for a long time. Both rule-based and statistics-based approaches have been
proposed to attack this problem in the past. For rule-based approaches, knowledge is
induced by linguistic experts and is encoded in terms of rules. Since a huge amount
of fine-grained knowledge is usually required to solve ambiguity problems, it is quite
difficult for a rule-based approach to acquire such kinds of knowledge. In addition, the
maintenance of consistency among the inductive rules is by no means easy. Therefore, a
rule-based approach, in general, fails to attain satisfactory performance for large-scale
applications.
In contrast, a statistical approach provides an objective measuring function to eval-
uate all possible alternative structures in terms of a set of parameters. Generally, the

statistics of parameters are estimated from a training corpus by using well-developed
statistical theorems. The linguistic uncertainty problems can thus be resolved on a solid
mathematical basis. Moreover, the knowledge acquired by a statistical method is al-
ways consistent because all the data in the corpus are jointly considered during the
acquisition process. Hence, compared with a rule-based method, the time required
for knowledge acquisition and the cost needed to maintain consistency among the ac-
quired knowledge sources are significantly reduced by adopting a statistical approach.
Among the statistical approaches, Su and Chang (1988) and Su et al. (1991) pro-
posed a unified scoring function for resolving syntactic ambiguity With that scoring
function, various knowledge sources can be unified in a uniform formulation. Previous
work has demonstrated that this scoring function is able to provide high discrimina-
tion power for a variety of applications (Su, Chiang, and Lin 1992; Chen et al. 1991;
Su and Chang 1990). In this paper, we start with a baseline system based on this
scoring function, and then proceed with different proposed enhancement methods. A
test set of 1,000 sentences, extracted from technical manuals, is used for evaluation. A
performance of 53.1% accuracy rate for parse tree selection is obtained for the base-
line system, when the parameters are estimated by using the maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) method.
Note that it is the ranking of competitors, instead of the likelihood value, that
directly affects the performance of a disambiguation task. Maximizing the likelihood
values on the training corpus, therefore, does not necessarily lead to the minimum
error rate. In addition, the statistical variations between the training corpus and real
tasks are usually not taken into consideration in the estimation procedure. Thus, min-
imizing the error rate on the training corpus does not imply minimizing the error rate
in the task we are really concerned with.
To deal with the problems described above, a variety of discrimination-based learn-
ing algorithms have been adopted extensively in the field of speech recognition (Bahl
et al. 1988; Katagiri et al. 1991; Su and Lee 1991, 1994). Among those approaches, the
robustness issue was discussed in detail by Su and Lee (1991, 1994) in particular, and
encouraging results were observed. In this paper, a discrimination oriented adaptive
learning algorithm is first derived based on the scoring function mentioned above
and probabilistic gradient descent theory (Amari 1967; Katagiri, Lee, and Juang 1991).
The parameters of the scoring function are then learned from the training corpus us-
ing the discriminative learning algorithm. The accuracy rate for parse tree selection is
improved to 56.4% when the discriminative learning algorithm is applied.
In addition to the discriminative learning algorithm described above, a robust
learning procedure is further applied in order to consider the possible statistical vari-
ations between the training corpus and the real task. The robust learning process
continues adjusting the parameters even though the input training token has been
correctly recognized, until the score difference between the correct candidate and the
top competitor exceeds a preset threshold. The reason for this is to provide a tolerance
zone with a large margin for better preserving the correct ranking orders for data in
real tasks. An accuracy rate of 64.3% for parse tree selection is attained after this robust
learning algorithm is used.
The above-mentioned robust learning procedure starts with the parameters ob-
tained by the maximum likelihood estimation method. However, the MLE is notori-
ously unreliable when there is insufficient training data. The MLE for the probability
of a null event is zero, which is generally inappropriate for most applications. To
avoid the sparse training data problem, the parameters are first estimated by various
parameter smoothing methods (Good 1953; Katz 1987). An accuracy rate for parse
tree selection is improved to 69.8% by applying the robust learning procedure to the

smoothed parameters. This result demonstrates that a better initial estimate of the pa-
rameters gives the robust learning procedure a chance to obtain better results when
many local maximal points exist.
Finally, a parameter tying scheme is proposed to reduce the number of parameters.
In this approach, some less reliably estimated but highly correlated parameters are tied
together, and then trained through the robust learning procedure. The probabilities of
the events that never appear in the training corpus can thus be trained more reliably.
This hybrid (tying + robust learning) approach reduces the number of parameters by
a factor of 2,000 (from 8.7 x 108 to 4.2 x 105) and achieves 70.3% accuracy rate for parse
tree selection.
This paper is organized as follows. A unified scoring function used for integrating
knowledge from lexical and syntactic levels is introduced in Section 2. The results
of using the unified scoring function are summarized in Section 3. In Section 4, the
discrimination- and robustness-oriented learning algorithm is derived. The effects of
the parameter smoothing techniques on the robust learning procedure are investigated
in Section 5. Next, the parameter tying scheme used to enhance parameter training
and reduce the number of parameters is described in Section 6. Finally, we discuss
our conclusions and describe the direction of future work.

Linguistic knowledge, including knowledge of lexicon, syntax, and semantics, is es-
sential for resolving syntactic ambiguities. To integrate various knowledge sources in a
uniform formulation, a unified probabilistic scoring function was proposed by Su et al.
(1991). This scoring function has been successfully applied to resolve ambiguity prob-
lems in an English-to-Chinese machine translation system (BehaviorTran) (Chen et al.
1991) and a spoken language processing system (Su, Chiang, and Lin 1991; 1992). The
unified probabilistic scoring function derived for the syntactic disambiguation task is

An illustration of syntactic ambiguities for an input sentence W (= wri1 = {w1, w2, • • •

Conventional stochastic context-free grammar (CFG) approaches (Wright and Wrigley
1991) evaluate the likelihood probability of a syntactic tree by computing the product
of the probabilities associated with the grammar rules being applied. Such a formu-
lation implies that the application of a rule is both independent of the applications
of the other rules, and independent of the context under which a context-free rule is
applied. However, a language that can be expressed with a CFG does not imply that
the associated rules can be applied in an independent and context-free manner, as im-
plicitly assumed by a stochastic context-free grammar approach. To include contextual
information and consider the relationship among the grammar rules, in this paper we
follow the formulation in Su et al. (1989, 1991) for syntactic score evaluation.
To show the computing mechanism for the syntactic score, we take the tree in Fig-
ure 2 as an example. The basic derivation of the syntactic score includes the following

steps. First, the tree is decomposed into a number of phrase levels, such as L1, L2, • • • , L8
in Figure 2. A phrase level is a sequence of symbols (terminal or nonterminal) that
acts as an intermediate result in parsing the input sentence, and is also called a senten-
tial form in formal language theory (Hoperoft and Ullman 1974). In the second step, we
formulate the transition between phrase levels as a context-sensitive rewriting process.
With the formulation, each transition probability between two phrase levels is calcu-
lated by consulting a finite-length window that comprises the symbols to be reduced
and their left and right contexts.
Let the label t, in Figure 2 be the time index for the ith state transition, which
corresponds to a reduce action, and L, be the ith phrase level. Then the syntactic score
of the tree in Figure 2 is defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999851">
Ssyn(Treex) P(L8, L7, • • • L2 L1)
= P(L8 L7, . , ) X P(L7 I L6, . , X • • • X P(L2 L1)
P(L8 I L7) x P(L7 I L6) x • • • x P(L2 I L1). (9)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997028">
The transition probability between two phrase levels, say P(L7 I L6), is the product of
the probabilities of two events. Taking P(L7 I L6) as an example, the first probability
corresponds to the event that {F, G} are the constituents to be reduced, and the sec-
ond probability corresponds to the event that they are reduced to C. The transition
probability can thus be expressed as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9993565">
P(L7 I L6) =- P(F,G are reduced I input is {B, F, G})
x P(C FG I F,G are reduced; input is {B,F,G}). (10)

According to the results of our experiments, the first term is equal to one in most
cases, and it makes little contribution to discriminating different syntactic structures.

where Treex is the parse tree X, $ and 0 correspond to the end-of-sentence marker and
the null symbol, respectively; and l and r, represent the left and right contexts to be
consulted in the ith phrase level, respectively. In the above equation, it is assumed that
each phrase level is highly correlated with its immediately preceding phrase level but
less correlated with other preceding phrase levels. In other words, the inter-level cor-
relation is assumed to be a first-order Markov process. In addition, for computational
feasibility, only a finite number of left and right contextual symbols are considered in
the formulation. If M left context symbols and N right context symbols are consulted
in evaluating Equation 9, the model is said to operate in the LmRN mode.
Notice that the last formula in Equation 9 corresponds to the rightmost deriva-
tion sequence in a generalized LR parser with left and right contexts taken into account
(Su et al. 1991). Such a formulation is particularly useful for a generalized LR pars-
ing algorithm, in which context-sensitive processing power is desirable. Although the
context-sensitive model in the above equation provides the ability to deal with intra-
level context-sensitivity, it fails to catch inter-level correlation. In addition, the formulation
of Equation 9 will result in the normalization problem (Su et al. 1991; Briscoe and Carroll
1993) when various syntactic trees have different number of nodes. An alternative for-
mulation, which compacts the highly correlated phrase levels into a single one, was
proposed by Su et al. (1991) to resolve the normalization problem. For instance, for the
syntactic tree in Figure 2, the syntactic score for the modified formulation is expressed
as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996816">
Ssy(Treex) P(L8, L7, L6 I L5) X P(Ls I L4) x P(L4, 1,3 I L2) X P(L2 I L1)
•-•-z% P(L8 I L5) X P(L5 I L4) X P(L4 I L2) X P(L2 I L1). (12)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849684210527">
Each pair of phrase levels in the above equation corresponds to a change in the LR
parser&apos;s stack before and after an input word is consumed by a shift operation. Because
the total number of shift actions, equal to the number of product terms in Equation 12,
is always the same for all alternative syntactic trees, the normalization problem is
resolved in such a formulation. Moreover, the formulation in Equation 12 provides
a way to consider both intra-level context-sensitivity and inter-level correlation of the
underlying context-free grammar. With such a formulation, the capability of context-
sensitive parsing (in probabilistic sense) can be achieved with a context-free grammar.
It is interesting to compare our frameworks (Su et al. 1991) with the work by
Briscoe and Carroll (1993) on probabilistic LR parsing. Instead of assigning probabili-
ties to the production rules as a conventional stochastic context-free grammar parser
does, Briscoe and Carroll distribute probability to each state so that the probabilities
of the transitions from a state sum to one; the preference to a SHIFT action is based
on one right context symbol (i.e., the lookahead symbol), and the preference for a RE-
DUCE action depends on the lookahead symbol and the previous state reached after
the REDUCE action. With such an approach, it is very easy to implement (mildly)
context-sensitive probabilistic parsing on existing LR parsers, and the probabilities
can be easily trained. The probabilities assigned to the states implicitly imply different
preferences for left-hand side contextual environment of the reduced symbol, since a

state, in general, can indicate part of the past parsing history (i.e., the left context)
from which the current reduced symbol follows.
However, because of the implicit encoding of the parsing history, a state may
fail to distinguish some left contextual environments correctly. This is not surprising,
because the LR parsing table generator would merge certain states according to the
context-free grammar and the closure operations on the sets of items. Therefore, there
are cases in which the same string is reduced, under different left contexts, to the same
symbol at the same state and return to the same state after reduction. For instance, if
several identical constructs, e.g., [X —+ a], are allowed in a recursive structure X*, and
the input contains a Y followed by three (or more) consecutive Xs, e.g., &amp;quot;YXXX,&amp;quot; then
the reduction of the second and third Xs will return to the same state after the same
rule is applied at that state. Under such circumstances, the associated probabilities
for these two REDUCE actions will be identical and thus will not reflect the different
preferences between them.
In our framework, it is easy to tell that the first REDUCE action is applied when
the two left context symbols are {Y,X}, and the second REDUCE is applied when the
left context is two Xs under an L2R1 mode of operation. Because such recursion is not
rare, for example, in groups of adjectives, nouns, conjunction constructs, prepositional
phrases in English, the estimated scores will be affected by such differences. In other
words, we use context symbols explicitly and directly to evaluate the probabilities
of a substructure instead of using the parsing state to implicitly encode past history,
which may fail to provide a sufficient characterization of the left context. In addition,
explicitly using the left context symbols allows easy use of smoothing techniques, such
as deleted interpolation (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983), clustering techniques (Brown
et al. 1992), and model refinement techniques (Lin, Chiang, and Su 1994) to estimate the
probabilities more reliably by changing the window sizes of the context and weighting
the various estimates dynamically. This kind of improvement is desirable when the
training data is limited.
Furthermore, Briscoe and Carroll (1993) use the geometric mean of the probabil-
ities, not their product, as the preference score, to avoid biasing their procedure in
favor of parse trees that have a smaller number of nodes (i.e., a smaller number of
rules being applied.) The geometric mean, however, fails to fit into the probabilis-
tic framework for disambiguation. In our approach, such a normalization problem is
avoided by considering a group of highly correlated phrase levels as a single phrase
level and evaluating the sequence of transitions for such phrase levels between the
SHIFT actions. Alternatively, it is also possible to consider each group of highly corre-
lated phrase levels as a joint event for evaluating its probability when enough data is
available. The optimization criteria are thus not compromised by the topologies of the
parse trees, because the number of SHIFT actions (i.e., the number of input tokens) is
fixed for an input sentence.

measures: accuracy rate and selection power. The measure of accuracy rate of parse tree
selection has been widely used in the literature. However, this measure is unable to
identify which model is better if the average number of alternative syntactic structures
in various tasks is different. For example, a language model with 91% accuracy rate
for a task with an average of 1.1 alternative syntactic structures per sentence, which
corresponds to the performance of random selection, is by no means better than the
language model that attains 70% accuracy rate when there are an average of 100
alternative syntactic structures per sentence. Therefore, a measure, namely Selection
Power (SP), is proposed in this paper to give additional information for evaluation.
SP is defined as the average selection factor (SF) of the disambiguation mechanism on
the task of interest. The selection factor for an input sentence is defined as the least
proportion of all possible alternative structures that includes the selected syntactic
structure.&apos; A smaller SP value would, in principle, imply better disambiguation power.
Formally, SP is expressed as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6895605">
1 (13)
SP E[SF1 N— 2_, sf (i) = N 2_, —n
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894">
where sf (i) = is the selection factor for the ith sentence; n, is the total number of
alternative syntactic structures for the ith sentence; r, is the rank of the most preferred
candidate. The selection power for a disambiguation mechanism basically serves as
an indicator of the selection ability that includes the most preferred candidate within
a particular (N-best) region. A mechanism with a smaller SP value is more likely to
include the most preferred candidate for some given N-best hypotheses.
In general, the measures of accuracy rate and the selection power are highly cor-
related. But it is more informative to report performance with both accuracy rate and
selection power. Selection power supplements accuracy rate when two language mod-
els to be compared are tested on different tasks.

The performances of the various models in terms of accuracy rate and selection power
are shown in Table 1; the values in the parentheses correspond to performance exclud-
ing unambiguous sentences. Table 1 shows that better performance (both in terms of
accuracy rate and selection power) can be attained when more contextual informa-
tion is consulted (or when more parameters are used). The improvement in resolution
of syntactic ambiguity by using more lexical contextual information, however, is not
statistically significant&apos; when the consulted contextual information in the syntactic
models is fixed. For instance, the test set performance for the Lex(L1)+Syn(L2) model
is 52.8%, while the performance for the Lex(L2)+Syn(L2) model is only 53.1%. With this
small performance difference, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the performance of
the Lex(L1)+Syn(L2) model is the same as that of the Lex(L1)+Syn(L2) model. On the
other hand, if the consulted lexical contexts are fixed, the performance of the syntactic
disambiguation process is improved significantly by using more syntactic contextual

structure most preferred by our linguistic experts.

4. Discrimination- and Robustness-Oriented Learning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951705882353">
Although MLE possesses many nice properties (Kendall and Stuart 1979), the criterion
of maximizing likelihood value is not equivalent to that of minimizing the error rate
in a training set. The maximum likelihood approach achieves disambiguation indirectly
and implicitly through the estimation procedure. However, correct disambiguation
only depends on the ranks, rather than the likelihood values, of the candidates. In other
words, correct recognition will still be obtained if the score of the correct candidate is
the highest, even though the likelihood values of the various candidates are estimated
poorly. Motivated by this concern, a discrimination-oriented learning procedure is
proposed in this paper to adjust the parameters iteratively such that the correct ranking
orders can be achieved.
A general adaptive learning algorithm for minimizing the error rate in the train-
ing set was proposed by Amari (1967) using the probability descent (PD) method.
The extension of PD, namely the generalized probability descent method (GPD), was
also developed by Katagiri, Lee, and Juang (1991). However, minimizing the error
rate in the training set cannot guarantee that the error rate in the test set is also min-
imized. Discrimination-based learning procedures, in general, tend to overtune the
training set performance unless the number of available data is several times larger

than the number of parameters (based on our experience). Overtuning the training
set performance usually causes performance on the test set to deteriorate. Hence, the
robustness issue, which concerns the possible statistical variations between the training
set and the test set, must be taken into consideration when we adopt an adaptive
learning procedure. In this section, we start with a learning algorithm derived from
the probabilistic descent procedure (Katagiri, Lee, and juang 1991). The robust learn-
ing algorithm explored by Su and Lee (1991, 1994) is then introduced to enhance the
robustness of the system.

To link the syntactic disambiguation process with the learning procedure, a discrim-

of the lexical and syntactic score components, and I is defined as the Euclidean
norm of the vector 43j,k. However, in such a formulation, the lexical scores as well as the
syntactic scores are assumed to contribute equally to the disambiguation process. This
assumption is inappropriate because different linguistic information may contribute
differently to various disambiguation tasks. Moreover, the preference scores related to
various types of linguistic information may have different dynamic ranges. Therefore,
different scores should be assigned different weights to account for both the contri-
bution in discrimination and the dynamic ranges. The discrimination function is thus
modified into the following form:

As the parameters are adjusted according to the learning rules described above, the
score of the correct candidate will increase and the score of the incorrect candidate
will decrease from iteration to iteration until the correct candidate is selected.
The ratio of the syntactic weight to the lexical weight, i.e., wsyn/wtex, finally turns
out to be 1.3 for the Lex(L2)+Syn(L2) model after the discriminative learning procedure
is applied. This ratio varies with the adopted language models, but is always larger
than 1.0. This result matches our expectation, because the syntactic score should pro-
vide more discrimination power than the lexical score in the syntactic disambiguation
task.
The experimental results of using the discriminative learning procedure with 20
iterations are shown in Table 2. For comparison, the corresponding results before
learning, i.e., the baseline results, are repeated in the upper row of each table entry.
For the Lex(L2)+Syn(L2) model, the accuracy rate for parse tree disambiguation in the
trairting set is improved from 79.04% to 92.77%, which corresponds to a 65.5% error
reduction rate. However, only a 7.03% error reduction rate is observed in the test set,
from 53.10% to 56.40%. Similar tendencies are also observed for the other models.
Since the discriminative learning procedure only aims at minimizing the error
rate in the training set, the training set performance can usually be tuned very closely
to 100% when a large number of parameters are available. However, the performance
improvement for the test set is far less than that for the training set, since the statistical
variations between the training set and the test set are not taken into consideration
in the learning procedure. For investigating robustness issues in more detail, a robust
learning procedure and the associated analyses are provided in the following section.

a real application. This over-tuning phenomenon happens mainly because of the lack
of sufficient sampling data and the possible statistical variations between the training
set and the test set.
To achieve better performance for a real application, one must deal with statistical
variation problems. Most adaptive learning procedures stop adjusting the parameters
once the input training token has been classified correctly For such learning proce-
dures, the distance between the correct candidate and other competitive ones may be
too small to cover the possible statistical variations between the training corpus and
the real application. To remedy this problem, Su and Lee (1991, 1994) suggested that
the distance margin between the correct candidate and the top competitor should be

The margin 6 in the above equations can be assigned either absolutely or relatively,
as suggested in Su and Lee (1991, 1994). Currently, the relative mode with a 30%
passing rate (i.e., 30% of the training tokens pass through the margin) is used in our
implementation.
The simulation results, compared with the results obtained by using the discrim-
inative learning procedure, are shown in Table 3. Table 3(a) shows that performances
with robust learning in the training set are a little worse than those with discrimination
learning for the L1 syntactic language models. Nevertheless, they are a little better for
the L2 syntactic language model. All these differences, however, are not statistically
significant. On the contrary, the results with robust learning for the test set, as shown
in Table 3(b), are much better in all cases. The robust learning procedure achieves
more than 8% improvement compared with the discriminative learning procedure for
all language models. It is evident that the robust learning procedure is superior to the
discriminative learning procedure in the test set.

5. Parameter Smoothing for Sparse Data
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999760333333333">
The above-mentioned robust learning algorithm starts with the initial parameters esti-
mated by using MLE method. MLE, however, frequently suffers from the large estima-
tion error caused by the lack of sufficient training data in many statistical approaches.
For example, MLE gives a zero probability to events that were never observed in the
training set. Therefore, MLE fails to provide a reliable result if only a small number of
sampling data are available. To overcome this problem, Good (1953) proposed using
Turing&apos;s formula as an improved estimate over the well-known MLE. In addition, Katz
(1987) proposed a different smoothing technique, called the Back-Off procedure, for
smoothing unreliably estimated n-gram parameters with their correlated (n-1)-gram
parameters. To investigate the effects of parameter smoothing on robust learning, both
these techniques are used to smooth the estimated parameters, and then the robust
learning procedure is applied based on those smoothed parameters. These two smooth-

Compared with Turing&apos;s formula, the probability for an m-gram that does not occur
in the sample is &amp;quot;backed off&amp;quot; to refer to its corresponding (m-1)-gram probability.
Table 4 gives the experimental results for using the maximum likelihood (ML), Tur-
ing (TU) and back-off (BF) estimation procedures. The results show that smoothing the
unreliable parameters degrades the training set performance; however, it improves the
performance for the test set. Among the estimators, the maximum likelihood estimator
provides the best results for the training set, but it is the worst on the test set. Both
Turing&apos;s and the back-off procedures perform better than the maximum likelihood
procedure. This means that smoothing unreliable parameters is absolutely essential if
only limited training data are available.
Compared with Turing&apos;s procedure, the back-off procedure is 1 — 2% worse in
all cases. After examining the estimated parameters by using these two smoothing
procedures, we found that some syntactic parameters for null events were assigned
very large values by the Back-Off procedure, while they were assigned small proba-
bilities by Turing&apos;s formula. A typical example is shown as follows. The reduce action
&amp;quot;n quan —+ NLM*&amp;quot; given the left contexts [P*, N2] never occurred in the training set.
But, the probability of P( n quan NLM* I [n quan] reduced; L2=P*, L1=N2) is finally
replaced by the probability of P( n quan NLM* [n quan] reduced) in the Back-Off
estimation procedure. Since the probability P( n quan NLM* I [n quan] reduced) has
a large value (= 0.25), the probability P( n quan NLM* I [n quan] are reduced; L2=P*,
L1=N2) is accordingly large also. From the estimation point of view, the parameters
for null events may be assigned better estimated values by using the Back-Off method;
however, these parameters do not necessarily guarantee that the discrimination power
will be better improved. Take the sentence &amp;quot;A stack of pinfeed paper three inches high may
be placed underneath it&amp;quot; as an example. The decomposed phrase levels and the corre-
sponding syntactic scores for the correct and the top candidate are shown in Table 5
(a) and (b), respectively. We find that the main factor affecting the tree selection is the
sixth phrase level, which corresponds to the reduce action &amp;quot;n quan NLM*&amp;quot; with the
left two contextual symbols P* and N2 for the top candidate. As described above, the
probability P( n quan --* NLM* [n quan] reduced; L2=P*, L1=N2) is assigned a large
value in the Back-Off estimation procedure. However, to correctly select the right syn-
tactic structure in this example, P( quan QUAN I [quan] reduced; L2=P*, L1=N2)
should be greater than P( n quan —+ NLM* I [n quan] reduced; L2=P*, L1=N2). This
requirement may not be met by any estimation procedure, since the above two prob-
abilities are estimated from two different outcome spaces (one conditioned on [quan],
and the other conditioned on [n, qua n]). Therefore, even though the Back-Off procedure
may give better estimates for the parameters, it cannot guarantee that the recognition
result can be improved. The comparison between Turing&apos;s procedure and the Back-
Off procedure thus varies in different cases. In fact, the Back-Off estimation did show
better results in our previous research (Lin, Chiang, and Su 1994). Nevertheless, we
will show in the next section that the selection of a smoothing method is not crucial
after the robust learning procedure has been applied.
Furthermore, comparing the results in Table 3 and Table 4, we find that the perfor-
mance with the robust learning procedure is much better than that with the smooth-
ing techniques. Although both the adaptive learning procedures and the smoothing
techniques show improvement, the robust learning procedure, which emphasizes dis-

The hybrid approach first uses a smoothing technique to estimate the initial param-
eters. Afterwards, the robust learning procedure is applied based on the smoothed
parameters. The advantages of this approach are two-fold. First, the power of the
scoring function is enhanced since the smoothing techniques can reduce the estima-
tion errors, especially for unseen events. Second, the parameters estimated from the
smoothing techniques give the robust learning procedure a better initial point and are
more likely to reach a better solution when many local optima exist in the parameter
space. In other words, the smoothing techniques indirectly prevent the learning pro-
cess from being trapped in a poor local optimum, although reducing the estimation

by using the smoothed parameters at the initial step before the robust learning proce-
dure is applied. With this hybrid approach, better results are obtained using a more
complex language model, such as Lex(L2)+Syn(L2). However, there is no significant
performance difference achieved by using the (TU+RL) and the (BF+RL) approaches
for all language models, even though Turing&apos;s smoothing formula was shown to be-
have better than the Back-Off procedure before applying the robust learning proce-
dure. This is not surprising because starting the robust learning procedure with dif-
ferent initial points would still lead to the same local optimum if the starting region,
where the initial points are located, has only one local optimum. By using Turing&apos;s
formula/Robust Learning hybrid approach for the Lex(L2)+Syn(L2) model, the ac-
curacy rate for parse tree selection is improved to 69.2%, which corresponds to a
34.3% error reduction compared with the baseline of 53.1% accuracy. The superiority
in terms of both discrimination and robustness for the hybrid approach is thus clearly
demonstrated.

<bodyText confidence="0.999988235294118">
The investigation described in Section 5 has shown that smoothing is essential before
the robust learning procedure is applied. Nevertheless, although we get better initial
estimates by smoothing parameters corresponding to rare events, these parameters
still cannot be trained well in the robust learning procedure, because such parameters
are seldom or never touched by the training process. Unfortunately, this problem
occurs frequently in statistical language modeling. This happens because, in general,
to reduce modeling errors, a model accounting for more contextual information is
desired. However, a model incorporating more contextual information would have
a larger number of null event parameters, which will not be touched in the learning
procedure.
To overcome this problem, a novel approach is proposed in this paper to train the
null event parameters by tying them to their highly correlated parameters, and then
adjusting them through the robust learning procedure. Basically, the reasons for using
this approach are two-fold. First, the number of parameters can be reduced by using
the tying scheme. Secondly, this tying scheme gives parameters for rare events more
chance to be touched in the learning procedure and thus they can be trained more
reliably. The details are addressed below.

Learning approach. In addition, it reduces the large number of parameters, and thus
greatly eases the memory constraints for implementing the system.
A summary illustrating the performance improvement by using the proposed
enhancement mechanisms for the Lex(L2)+Syn(L2) model is shown in Table 9. The
proposed tying approach, after being combined with the robust learning procedure,
significantly reduces the error rate compared with the baseline (36.67% error reduction

approach fails to achieve satisfactory performance because the discrimination and ro-
bustness issues are not considered in the estimation process. To improve performance,
a discrimination- and robustness-oriented method is adopted to directly pursue the
correct ranking orders of possible alternative syntactic structures. In addition, this
learning procedure is able to resolve problems resulting from statistical variations
between the training corpus and real tasks.
The effects of parameter smoothing for null events with Turing&apos;s formula and
the Back-Off method are investigated in this paper. A better initial estimate of the
parameters makes the robust learning procedure achieve better performance when
many local optima exist in the parameter space. Significant improvement of 34.3%
error reduction rate is attained when we apply the robust learning procedure on the
smoothed parameters.
Finally, a parameter tying scheme for rare events is proposed so that the unreli-
ably estimated parameters are tied and trained together through the robust learning
procedure. Thus, this approach makes it possible to tune all the parameters through
the learning process. In addition, the number of parameters is significantly reduced
with the tying process. The reduction of the number of parameters is over 99% for
each language model. Moreover, the accuracy rate of 70.3% for parse tree selection, or
36.7% error reduction rate, is obtained by using this novel approach.
To explore the areas for further improving the system, the remaining errors have
been examined. It was found that a very large portion of errors result from attachment
problems, including prepositional phrase (PP) attachment and modification scope for
adverbial phrases, adjective phrases, and relative clauses, while less than 10% of the
errors arise because of incorrect part-of-speech tagging. To further improve the lexical
scoring module, some refinement mechanisms developed for our part-of-speech tagger
(Lin, Chiang, and Su 1994) will be incorporated into this system. As for the attachment
problems, we found that the system appears to have a preference for local attachment,
which is not always inappropriate. The current model fails to deal with such problems
because only syntactic information from two left contextual nonterminal symbols is
consulted for computation. To resolve the attachment problems, integrating seman-

tic information, such as word sense collocations, would be required. In addition, to
enable the system to take into account information associated with long-distance de-
pendency, we plan to modify the syntactic model so that it can evaluate structural
dependency across various subtrees in the parse history. A large number of parameters
will inevitably be required for such a formulation, and a large training corpus is thus
needed for training. A bootstrapping procedure for parameter estimation with respect
to a very large corpus, therefore, will be applied in future research.

<abstract confidence="0.993394470588235">Statistical approaches to natural language processing generally obtain the parameters by using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method. The MLE approaches, however, may fail to achieve good performance in difficult tasks, because the discrimination and robustness issues are not taken into consideration in the estimation processes. Motivated by that concern, a discriminationand robustness-oriented learning algorithm is proposed in this paper for minimizing the error rate. In evaluating the robust learning procedure on a corpus of 1,000 sentences, 64.3% of the sentences are assigned their correct syntactic structures, while only 53.1% accuracy rate is obtained with the MLE approach. In addition, parameters are usually estimated poorly when the training data is sparse. Smoothing the parameters is thus important in the estimation process. Accordingly, we use a hybrid approach combining the robust learning procedure with the smoothing method. The accuracy rate of 69.8% is attained by using this approach. Finally, a parameter tying scheme is proposed to tie those highly correlated but unreliably estimated parameters together so that the parameters can be better trained in the learning process. With this tying scheme, the number of parameters reduced by a factor of 2,000 (from 8.7 x to 4.2 x and the accuracy rate for parse tree selection is improved up to 70.3% when the robust learning procedure is applied on the tied parameters.</abstract>

In other words, correct recognition will still be obtained if the score of the correct candidate is the highest, even though the likelihood values of the various candidates are estimated poorly. Motivated by this concern, a discrimination-oriented learning procedure is proposed in this paper to adjust the parameters iteratively such that the correct ranking orders can be achieved. A general adaptive learning algorithm for minimizing the error rate in the training set was proposed by Amari (1967) using the probability descent (PD) method. The extension of PD, namely the generalized probability descent method (GPD), was also developed by Katagiri, Lee, and Juang (1991). However, minimizing the error rate in the training set cannot guarantee that the error rate in the test set is also minimized. Discrimination-based learning procedures, in general, tend to overtune the training set performance unless the number of available data is several times larger 331 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 than the number of parameters (based on our experience).

Notice that the last formula in Equation 9 corresponds to the rightmost derivation sequence in a generalized LR parser with left and right contexts taken into account (Su et al. 1991). Such a formulation is particularly useful for a generalized LR parsing algorithm, in which context-sensitive processing power is desirable. Although the context-sensitive model in the above equation provides the ability to deal with intralevel context-sensitivity, it fails to catch inter-level correlation. In addition, the formulation of Equation 9 will result in the normalization problem (Su et al. 1991; Briscoe and Carroll 1993) when various syntactic trees have different number of nodes. An alternative formulation, which compacts the highly correlated phrase levels into a single one, was proposed by Su et al. (1991) to resolve the normalization problem. For instance, for the syntactic tree in Figure 2, the syntactic score for the modified formulation is expressed as follows: Ssy(Treex) P(L8, L7, L6 I L5) X P(Ls I L4) x P(L4, 1,3 I L2) X P(L2 I L1) •-•-z% P(L8 I L5) X P(L5 I L4) X P(L4 I L2) X P(L2 I L1).

Moreover, the formulation in Equation 12 provides a way to consider both intra-level context-sensitivity and inter-level correlation of the underlying context-free grammar. With such a formulation, the capability of contextsensitive parsing (in probabilistic sense) can be achieved with a context-free grammar. It is interesting to compare our frameworks (Su et al. 1991) with the work by Briscoe and Carroll (1993) on probabilistic LR parsing. Instead of assigning probabilities to the production rules as a conventional stochastic context-free grammar parser does, Briscoe and Carroll distribute probability to each state so that the probabilities of the transitions from a state sum to one; the preference to a SHIFT action is based on one right context symbol (i.e., the lookahead symbol), and the preference for a REDUCE action depends on the lookahead symbol and the previous state reached after the REDUCE action. With such an approach, it is very easy to implement (mildly) context-sensitive probabilistic p</context>

In addition, explicitly using the left context symbols allows easy use of smoothing techniques, such as deleted interpolation (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983), clustering techniques (Brown et al. 1992), and model refinement techniques (Lin, Chiang, and Su 1994) to estimate the probabilities more reliably by changing the window sizes of the context and weighting the various estimates dynamically. This kind of improvement is desirable when the training data is limited. Furthermore, Briscoe and Carroll (1993) use the geometric mean of the probabilities, not their product, as the preference score, to avoid biasing their procedure in favor of parse trees that have a smaller number of nodes (i.e., a smaller number of rules being applied.) The geometric mean, however, fails to fit into the probabilistic framework for disambiguation. In our approach, such a normalization problem is avoided by considering a group of highly correlated phrase levels as a single phrase level and evaluating the sequence of transitions for such phrase levels between the SHIFT actions.

Among the statistical approaches, Su and Chang (1988) and Su et al. (1991) proposed a unified scoring function for resolving syntactic ambiguity With that scoring function, various knowledge sources can be unified in a uniform formulation. Previous work has demonstrated that this scoring function is able to provide high discrimination power for a variety of applications (Su, Chiang, and Lin 1992; Chen et al. 1991; Su and Chang 1990). In this paper, we start with a baseline system based on this scoring function, and then proceed with different proposed enhancement methods. A test set of 1,000 sentences, extracted from technical manuals, is used for evaluation. A performance of 53.1% accuracy rate for parse tree selection is obtained for the baseline system, when the parameters are estimated by using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method. Note that it is the ranking of competitors, instead of the likelihood value, that directly affects the performance of a disambiguation task. Maximizing the li</context>

Finally, we discuss our conclusions and describe the direction of future work. 2. A Unified Probabilistic Score Function Linguistic knowledge, including knowledge of lexicon, syntax, and semantics, is essential for resolving syntactic ambiguities. To integrate various knowledge sources in a uniform formulation, a unified probabilistic scoring function was proposed by Su et al. (1991). This scoring function has been successfully applied to resolve ambiguity problems in an English-to-Chinese machine translation system (BehaviorTran) (Chen et al. 1991) and a spoken language processing system (Su, Chiang, and Lin 1991; 1992). The unified probabilistic scoring function derived for the syntactic disambiguation task is summarized in the following sections. 2.1 Definition An illustration of syntactic ambiguities for an input sentence W (= wri1 = {w1, w2, • • • wr,}) is shown in Figure 1, where w, (i = 1, n) stands for the ith word of the input sentence. In this figure, Lexk (1 &lt; k &lt; m) stands for the kth lexical sequence out of M possible sequences. Synj,k (1 &lt; j &lt; Nk) is the jth alternative syntactic structure corresponding to Lexk, and Nk is t</context>

The optimization criteria are thus not compromised by the topologies of the parse trees, because the number of SHIFT actions (i.e., the number of input tokens) is fixed for an input sentence. 3. Baseline Model To establish a benchmark for examining the power of the proposed algorithms, we begin with a baseline system, in which the parameters are estimated by using the MLE method. Later, we will show how to improve the baseline model with the proposed enhancement mechanisms. 3.1 Experimental Setup First of all, 10,000 parsed sentences generated by BehaviorTran (Chen et al. 1991), a commercialized English-to-Chinese machine translation system designed by Behavior 328 Tung-Hui Chiang et al. Robust Learning, Smoothing, and Parameter Tying Design Corporation (BDC), were collected. The domain for this corpus is computer manuals and documents. The correct parts of speech and parse trees for the collected sentences were verified by linguistic experts. The corpus was then randomly partitioned into a training set of 9,000 sentences and a test set of the remaining 1,000 sentences to eliminate possible systematic biases.

First, the tree is decomposed into a number of phrase levels, such as L1, L2, • • • , L8 in Figure 2. A phrase level is a sequence of symbols (terminal or nonterminal) that acts as an intermediate result in parsing the input sentence, and is also called a sentential form in formal language theory (Hoperoft and Ullman 1974). In the second step, we formulate the transition between phrase levels as a context-sensitive rewriting process. With the formulation, each transition probability between two phrase levels is calculated by consulting a finite-length window that comprises the symbols to be reduced and their left and right contexts. Let the label t, in Figure 2 be the time index for the ith state transition, which corresponds to a reduce action, and L, be the ith phrase level.

Discrimination- and Robustness-Oriented Learning Although MLE possesses many nice properties (Kendall and Stuart 1979), the criterion of maximizing likelihood value is not equivalent to that of minimizing the error rate in a training set. The maximum likelihood approach achieves disambiguation indirectly and implicitly through the estimation procedure. However, correct disambiguation only depends on the ranks, rather than the likelihood values, of the candidates. In other words, correct recognition will still be obtained if the score of the correct candidate is the highest, even though the likelihood values of the various candidates are estimated poorly.

Hence, the robustness issue, which concerns the possible statistical variations between the training set and the test set, must be taken into consideration when we adopt an adaptive learning procedure. In this section, we start with a learning algorithm derived from the probabilistic descent procedure (Katagiri, Lee, and juang 1991). The robust learning algorithm explored by Su and Lee (1991, 1994) is then introduced to enhance the robustness of the system. 4.1 Discrimination-Oriented Learning To link the syntactic disambiguation process with the learning procedure, a discrimination function, namely g ,k(w7), for the syntactic tree Syni,k, corresponding to the lexical sequence Lexk and the input sentence (or word sequence) &amp;it, is defined as gi,k (wiz ) = log P (Syn),k, Lexk I wi) (14) Since log() is a monotonic increasing function, we can rewrite the criterion for syntactic disambiguation in Equation 1 as the following equation: = argmax{gi,k (w7 )1 (15) ,k According to Equation</context>

To achieve better performance for a real application, one must deal with statistical variation problems. Most adaptive learning procedures stop adjusting the parameters once the input training token has been classified correctly For such learning procedures, the distance between the correct candidate and other competitive ones may be too small to cover the possible statistical variations between the training corpus and the real application. To remedy this problem, Su and Lee (1991, 1994) suggested that the distance margin between the correct candidate and the top competitor should be enlarged, even though the input token is correctly recognized, until the margin exceeds a given threshold. A large distance margin would provide a tolerance region in the neighborhood of the decision boundary to allow possible data scattering in the real applications (Su and Lee 1994).

The simulation results, compared with the results obtained by using the discriminative learning procedure, are shown in Table 3. Table 3(a) shows that performances with robust learning in the training set are a little worse than those with discrimination learning for the L1 syntactic language models.

To remedy this problem, Su and Lee (1991, 1994) suggested that the distance margin between the correct candidate and the top competitor should be enlarged, even though the input token is correctly recognized, until the margin exceeds a given threshold. A large distance margin would provide a tolerance region in the neighborhood of the decision boundary to allow possible data scattering in the real applications (Su and Lee 1994). A promising result has been observed by applying 336 Tung-Hui Chiang et al. Robust Learning, Smoothing, and Parameter Tying this robust learning procedure to recognize the alphabet of E-set in English (Su and Lee 1991, 1994). To enhance robustness, the learning rules from Equation 24 to Equation 30 are modified as follows. Following the notations in the previous section, the correct syntactic structure is denoted by Syna,,r3 , and the syntactic structure of the strongest competitor is denoted by Syn 5J(, whose score may either rank first or second. 1.

A Unified Probabilistic Score Function Linguistic knowledge, including knowledge of lexicon, syntax, and semantics, is essential for resolving syntactic ambiguities. To integrate various knowledge sources in a uniform formulation, a unified probabilistic scoring function was proposed by Su et al. (1991). This scoring function has been successfully applied to resolve ambiguity problems in an English-to-Chinese machine translation system (BehaviorTran) (Chen et al. 1991) and a spoken language processing system (Su, Chiang, and Lin 1991; 1992). The unified probabilistic scoring function derived for the syntactic disambiguation task is summarized in the following sections. 2.1 Definition An illustration of syntactic ambiguities for an input sentence W (= wri1 = {w1, w2, • • • wr,}) is shown in Figure 1, where w, (i = 1, n) stands for the ith word of the input sentence.

In other words, the inter-level correlation is assumed to be a first-order Markov process. In addition, for computational feasibility, only a finite number of left and right contextual symbols are considered in the formulation. If M left context symbols and N right context symbols are consulted in evaluating Equation 9, the model is said to operate in the LmRN mode. Notice that the last formula in Equation 9 corresponds to the rightmost derivation sequence in a generalized LR parser with left and right contexts taken into account (Su et al. 1991). Such a formulation is particularly useful for a generalized LR parsing algorithm, in which context-sensitive processing power is desirable. Although the context-sensitive model in the above equation provides the ability to deal with intralevel context-sensitivity, it fails to catch inter-level correlation. In addition, the formulation of Equation 9 will result in the normalization problem (Su et al. 1991; Briscoe and Carroll 1993) when various syntactic trees have different number of nodes.

Because the total number of shift actions, equal to the number of product terms in Equation 12, is always the same for all alternative syntactic trees, the normalization problem is resolved in such a formulation. Moreover, the formulation in Equation 12 provides a way to consider both intra-level context-sensitivity and inter-level correlation of the underlying context-free grammar. With such a formulation, the capability of contextsensitive parsing (in probabilistic sense) can be achieved with a context-free grammar. It is interesting to compare our frameworks (Su et al. 1991) with the work by Briscoe and Carroll (1993) on probabilistic LR parsing. Instead of assigning probabilities to the production rules as a conventional stochastic context-free grammar parser does, Briscoe and Carroll distribute probability to each state so that the probabilities of the transitions from a state sum to one; the preference to a SHIFT action is based on one right context symbol (i.e., the lookahead symbol), and the preference for a REDUCE action depends on the lookahead symbol and the previous state reached after the REDUCE action.
