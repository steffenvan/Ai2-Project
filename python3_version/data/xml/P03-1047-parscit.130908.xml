Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) is
the standard formalism used in large-scale
HPSG grammars to model underspecified
semantics. We present the first provably
efficient algorithm to enumerate the read-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9994734">
In the past few years there has been considerable
activity in the development of formalisms for un-
derspecified semantics (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992;
Reyle, 1993; Bos, 1996; Copestake et al., 1999; Egg
et al., 2001). The common idea is to delay the enu-
meration of all readings for as long as possible. In-
stead, they work with a compact underspecified rep-
resentation; readings are enumerated from this rep-
resentation by need.
Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copes-
take et al., 1999) is the standard formalism for se-
mantic underspecification used in large-scale HPSG
grammars (Pollard and Sag, 1994; Copestake and
Flickinger, ). Despite this clear relevance, the most
obvious questions about MRS are still open:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9781565">
1. Is it possible to enumerate the readings of
MRS structures efficiently? No algorithm has
been published so far. Existing implementa-
tions seem to be practical, even though the
problem whether an MRS has a reading is NP-
complete (Althaus et al., 2003, Theorem 10.1).
2. What is the precise relationship to other un-
derspecification formalism? Are all of them the

same, or else, what are the differences?
We distinguish the sublanguages of MRS nets
and normal dominance nets, and show that they
can be intertranslated. This translation answers the
first question: existing constraint solvers for normal
dominance constraints can be used to enumerate the
readings of MRS nets in low polynomial time.
The translation also answers the second ques-
tion restricted to pure scope underspecification. It
shows the equivalence of a large fragment of MRSs
and a corresponding fragment of normal dominance
constraints, which in turn is equivalent to a large
fragment of Hole Semantics (Bos, 1996) as proven
in (Koller et al., 2003). Additional underspecified
treatments of ellipsis or reinterpretation, however,
are available for extensions of dominance constraint
only (CLLS, the constraint language for lambda
structures (Egg et al., 2001)).
Our results are subject to a new proof tech-
nique which reduces reasoning about MRS struc-
tures to reasoning about weakly normal dominance
constraints (Bodirsky et al., 2003). The previous
proof techniques for normal dominance constraints
(Koller et al., 2003) do not apply.

We define a simplified version of Minimal Recur-
sion Semantics and discuss differences to the origi-
nal definitions presented in (Copestake et al., 1999).
MRS is a description language for formulas of
first order object languages with generalized quanti-
fiers. Underspecified representations in MRS consist
of elementary predications and handle constraints.
Roughly, elementary predications are object lan-
guage formulas with “holes” into which other for-
mulas can be plugged; handle constraints restrict the
way these formulas can be plugged into each other.
More formally, MRSs are formulas over the follow-
ing vocabulary:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997874">
1. Variables. An infinite set of variables ranged
over by h. Variables are also called handles.
2. Constants. An infinite set of constants ranged
over by x,y,z. Constants are the individual vari-
ables of the object language.
3. Function symbols.
(a) A set of function symbols written as P.
(b) A set of quantifier symbols ranged over
by Q (such as every and some). Pairs Qx
are further function symbols (the variable
binders of x in the object language).
4. The symbol &lt; for the outscopes relation.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.713584">
Formulas of MRS have three kinds of literals, the
first two are called elementary predications (EPs)
and the third handle constraints:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990289">
1. h:P(x1,...,xn,h1,...,hm) where n,m &gt; 0
2. h:Qx(h1,h2)
3. h1 &lt; h2
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.898146869565217">
Label positions are to the left of colons ‘:’ and argu-
ment positions to the right. Let M be a set of literals.
The label set lab(M) contains those handles of M
that occur in label but not in argument position. The
argument handle set arg(M) contains the handles of
M that occur in argument but not in label position.
Definition 1 (MRS). An MRS is finite set M of
MRS-literals such that:
M1 Every handle occurs at most once in label and
at most once in argument position in M.
M2 Handle constraints h1 &lt; h2 in M always relate
argument handles h1 to labels h2 of M.
M3 For every constant (individual variable) x in ar-
gument position in M there is a unique literal of
the form h:Qx(h1,h2) in M.
We call an MRS compact if it additionally satisfies:
M4 Every handle of M occurs exactly once in an
elementary predication of M.
We say that a handle h immediately outscopes a
handle h&apos; in an MRS Miff there is an EP E in M such
that h occurs in label and h&apos; in argument position of
E. The outscopes relation is the reflexive, transitive
closure of the immediate outscopes relation.

An example MRS for the scopally ambiguous
sentence “Every student reads a book” is given in
Fig. 1. We often represent MRSs by directed graphs
whose nodes are the handles of the MRS. Elemen-
tary predications are represented by solid edges and
handle constraints by dotted lines. Note that we
make the relation between bound variables and their
binders explicit by dotted lines (as from everyx to
readx,y); redundant “binding-edges” that are sub-
sumed by sequences of other edges are omitted how-
ever (from everyx to studentx for instance).
A solution for an underspecified MRS is called a
configuration, or scope-resolved MRS.
Definition 2 (Configuration). An MRS M is a con-
figuration if it satisfies the following conditions.
C1 The graph of M is a tree of solid edges: handles
don’t properly outscope themselves or occur in
different argument positions and all handles are
pairwise connected by elementary predications.
C2 If two EPs h:P(...,x,...) and h0:Qx(h1,h2)
belong to M, then h0 outscopes h in M (so that
the binding edge from h0 to h is redundant).
We call M a configuration for another MRS M&apos; if
there exists some substitution 6 : arg(M&apos;) H lab(M&apos;)
which states how to identify argument handles of M&apos;
with labels of M&apos;, so that:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.7740035">
C3 M = {6(E)  |E is EP in M&apos;}, and
C4 6(h1) outscopes h2 in M, for all h1 &lt; h2 E M&apos;.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998592857142857">
The value 6(E) is obtained by substituting all ar-
gument handles in E, leaving all others unchanged.
The MRS in Fig. 1 has precisely two configura-
tions displayed in Fig. 2 which correspond to the two
readings of the sentence. In this paper, we present
an algorithm that enumerates the configurations of
MRSs efficiently.

Differences to Standard MRS. Our version de-
parts from standard MRS in some respects. First,
we assume that different EPs must be labeled with
different handles, and that labels cannot be identi-
fied. In standard MRS, however, conjunctions are
encoded by labeling different EPs with the same
handle. These EP-conjunctions can be replaced in
a preprocessing step introducing additional EPs that
make conjunctions explicit.
Second, our outscope constraints are slightly less
restrictive than the original “qeq-constraints.” A
handle h is qeq to a handle h&apos; in an MRS M, h =q h&apos;,
if either h = h&apos; or a quantifier h:Q,(h1,h2) occurs
in M and h2 is qeq to h&apos; in M. Thus, h =q h&apos; im-
plies h &lt; h&apos;, but not the other way round. We believe
that the additional strength of qeq-constraints is not
needed in practice for modeling scope. Recent work
in semantic construction for HPSG (Copestake et
al., 2001) supports our conjecture: the examples dis-
cussed there are compatible with our simplification.
Third, we depart in some minor details: we
use sets instead of multi-sets and omit top-handles
which are useful only during semantics construction.

3 Dominance Constraints

<bodyText confidence="0.9911204">
Dominance constraints are a general framework for
describing trees, and thus syntax trees of logical for-
mulas. Dominance constraints are the core language
underlying CLLS (Egg et al., 2001) which adds par-
allelism and binding constraints.

3.1 Syntax and Semantics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990714285714">
We assume a possibly infinite signature Σ of func-
tion symbols with fixed arities and an infinite set Var
of variables ranged over by X,Y,Z. We write f,g for
function symbols and ar(f) for the arity of f.
A dominance constraint ϕ is a conjunction of
dominance, inequality, and labeling literals of the
following forms where ar(f) = n:

Dominance constraints are interpreted over finite
constructor trees, i.e. ground terms constructed from
the function symbols in Σ. We identify ground terms
with trees that are rooted, ranked, edge-ordered and
labeled. A solution for a dominance constraint con-
sists of a tree τ and a variable assignment α that
maps variables to nodes of τ such that all constraints
are satisfied: a labeling literal X : f(X1,...,Xn) is sat-
isfied iff the node α(X) is labeled with f and has
daughters α(X1),...,α(Xn) in this order; a domi-
nance literal Xa*Y is satisfied iff α(X) is an ancestor
of α(Y) in τ; and an inequality literal X =� Y is satis-
fied iff α(X) and α(Y) are distinct nodes.
Note that solutions may contain additional mate-
rial. The tree f(a,b), for instance, satisfies the con-
straint Y :a n Z:b.

3.2 Normality and Weak Normality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.919091090909091">
The satisfiability problem of arbitrary dominance
constraints is NP-complete (Koller et al., 2001) in
general. However, Althaus et al. (2003) identify a
natural fragment of so called normal dominance
constraints, which have a polynomial time satisfia-
bility problem. Bodirsky et al. (2003) generalize this
notion to weakly normal dominance constraints.
We call a variable a hole of ϕ if it occurs in argu-
ment position in ϕ and a root of ϕ otherwise.
Definition 3. A dominance constraint ϕ is normal
(and compact) if it satisfies the following conditions.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.909715285714286">

N3 (a) if X &lt;* Y occurs in ϕ, Y is a root in ϕ.
(b) ifX &lt;* Y occurs in ϕ, X is a hole in ϕ.

A dominance constraint is weakly normal if it satis-
fies all above properties except for N1(b) and N3(b).
The idea behind (weak) normality is that the con-
straint graph (see below) of a dominance constraint
consists of solid fragments which are connected
by dominance constraints; these fragments may not
properly overlap in solutions.
Note that Definition 3 always imposes compact-
ness, meaning that the heigth of solid fragments is at
most one. As for MRS, this is not a serious restric-
tion, since more general weakly normal dominance

constraints can be compactified, provided that dom-
inance links relate either roots or holes with roots.
Dominance Graphs. We often represent domi-
nance constraints as graphs. A dominance graph is
the directed graph (V,/* U+/). The graph of a weakly
normal constraint ϕ is defined as follows: The nodes
of the graph of ϕ are the variables of ϕ. A labeling
literal X : f(X1,...,Xn) of ϕ contributes tree edges
(X,Xi) E / for 1 &lt; i &lt; n that we draw as X Xi;
we freely omit the label f and the edge order in the
graph. A dominance literal X/*Y contributes a dom-
inance edge (X,Y) E /* that we draw as X Y.
Inequality literals in ϕ are also omitted in the graph.
For example, the constraint graph
on the right represents the dominance
constraint X : f(X&apos;) nY :g(Y&apos;) n X&apos;/*Z n
Y&apos;/*Z n Z:a n X7Y n XYZ nY7�Z.
A dominance graph is weakly normal or a wnd-
graph if it does not contain any forbidden subgraphs:
Dominance graphs of a weakly normal dominance
constraints are clearly weakly normal.
Solved Forms and Configurations. The main dif-
ference between MRS and dominance constraints
lies in their notion of interpretation: solutions versus
configurations.
Every satisfiable dominance constraint has in-
finitely many solutions. Algorithms for dominance
constraints therefore do not enumerate solutions but
solved forms. We say that a dominance constraint is
in solved form iff its graph is in solved form. A wnd-
graph Φ is in solved form iff Φ is a forest. The solved
forms of Φ are solved forms Φ&apos; that are more spe-
cific than Φ, i.e. Φ and Φ&apos; differ only in their dom-
inance edges and the reachability relation of Φ ex-
tends the reachability of Φ&apos;. A minimal solved form
of Φ is a solved form of Φ that is minimal with re-
spect to specificity.
The notion of configurations from MRS applies
to dominance constraints as well. Here, a configu-
ration is a dominance constraint whose graph is a
tree without dominance edges. A configuration of a
constraint ϕ is a configuration that solves ϕ in the
obvious sense. Simple solved forms are tree-shaped
solved forms where every hole has exactly one out-
going dominance edge.

Lemma 1. Simple solved forms and configurations
correspond: Every simple solved form has exactly
one configuration, and for every configuration there
is exactly one solved form that it configures.
Unfortunately, Lemma 1 does not extend to min-
imal as opposed to simple solved forms: there are
minimal solved forms without configurations. The
constraint on the right of Fig. 3, for instance, has no
configuration: the hole of L1 would have to be filled
twice while the right hole of L2 cannot be filled.

4 Representing MRSs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999845555555555">
We next map (compact) MRSs to weakly normal
dominance constraints so that configurations are
preserved. Note that this translation is based on a
non-standard semantics for dominance constraints,
namely configurations. We address this problem in
the following sections.
The translation of an MRS M to a dominance con-
straint ϕM is quite trivial. The variables of ϕM are the
handles of M and its literal set is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9150236">
{h:Px1,...,xn(h1,...)  |h:P(x1,...,xn,h1,...) E M}
U{h:Qx(h1,h2)  |h:Qx(h1,h2) E M}
U{h1/*h2  |h1 &lt; h2 E M}
U{h/*h0  |h:Qx(h1,h2),h0 :P(...,x,...) E M}
U{huh&apos;  |h,h&apos; in distinct label positions of M}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9957825">
Compact MRSs M are clearly translated into (com-
pact) weakly normal dominance constraints. Labels
of M become roots in ϕM while argument handles
become holes. Weak root-to-root dominance literals
are needed to encode variable binding condition C2
of MRS. It could be formulated equivalently through
lambda binding constraints of CLLS (but this is not
necessary here in the absence of parallelism).

is weakly connected, so that we can call solve((D).
This procedure guesses topmost fragments in solved
forms of (D (which always exist by Prop. 2).
The only candidates are L1 or L2 since L3 and
L4 have incoming dominance edges, which violates
F1. Let us choose the fragment L2 to be topmost.
The graph which remains when removing L2 is still
weakly connected. It has a single minimal solved
form computed by a recursive call of the solver,
where L1 dominates L3 and L4. The solved form of
the restricted graph is then put below the left hole of
L2, since it is connected to this hole. As a result, we
obtain the solved form on the right of Fig. 3.

We cannot even hope to translate arbitrary MRSs

problem of MRSs is NP-complete, while satisfia-

A dominance net Φ is a weakly normal domi-

fined analogously. This means that all roots of Φ are

islands replaces the notion of chain-connectedness
in (Koller et al., 2003), which fails to apply to dom-
inance constraints with weak dominance edges.
For ease of presentation, we restrict ourselves to
a simple version of island fragments. In general, we
should allow for island fragments with n &gt; 1.

solved forms with top-most fragments L1 and L2 re-
spectively. The former can be configured, in contrast
to the later which is drawn on the right of Fig. 3.
Normalizing Φ has an interesting consequence:
norm(Φ) has (in contrast to Φ) a single minimal
solved form with L1 on top. Indeed, norm(Φ) cannot
be satisfied while placing L2 topmost. Our algorithm
detects this correctly: the normalization of fragment
L2 is not free in norm(Φ) since it violates property
F2.
The proof of Theorem 2 captures the rest of this
section. We show in a first step (Prop. 3) that the con-
figurations are preserved when normalizing weakly
connected and satisfiable nets. In the second step,
we show that minimal solved forms of normalized
nets, and thus of norm(Φ), can always be configured
(Prop. 4).
Corollary 1. Configurability of weakly connected
MRS-nets can be decided in polynomial time; con-
figurations of weakly connected MRS-nets can be
enumerated in quadratic time per configuration.

Most importantly, nets can be recursively decom-
posed into nets as long as they have configurations:
Lemma 3. If a dominance net Φ has a configuration
whose top-most fragment is X : f(X1,...,Xn), then
the restriction Φ|V−{X,X1,...,Xn} is a dominance net.
Note that the restriction of the problematic net Φ
by L2 on the left in Fig. 3 is not a net. This does not
contradict the lemma, as Φ does not have a configu-
ration with top-most fragment L2.
Proof. First note that as X is free in Φ it cannot have
incoming edges (condition F1). This means that the
restriction deletes only dominance edges that depart
from nodes in {X,X1,...,Xn}. Other fragments thus
only lose ingoing dominance edges by normality
condition N3. Such deletions preserve the validity
of the schemas weak and strong.
The island schema is more problematic. We have
to show that the hypernormal connections in this
schema can never be cut. So suppose that Y : f(Y1) is
an island fragment with outgoing dominance edges
Y1 a∗ Z1 and Y1 a∗ Z2, so that Z1 and Z2 are con-
nected by some hypernormal path traversing the
deleted fragment X : f(X1,...,Xn). We distinguish
the three possible schemata for this fragment:
strong: since X does not have incoming dominance
edges, there is only a single non-trival kind of traver-
sal, drawn in Fig. 6(a). But such traversals contradict
the freeness of X according to F2.
weak: there is one other way of traversing weak
fragments, shown in Fig. 6(b). Let X a∗ Y be the
weak dominance edge. The traversal proves that Y
belongs to the weakly connected components of one
of the Xi, so the Φ ∧Xn a∗ Y is unsatisfiable. This
shows that the hole Xn cannot be identified with any
root, i.e. Φ does not have any configuration in con-
trast to our assumption.
island: free island fragments permit one single non-
trivial form of traversals, depicted in Fig. 6(c). But
such traversals are not hypernormal.
Proposition 3. A configuration of a weakly con-
nected dominance net Φ configures its normalization
norm(Φ), and vice versa of course.
Proof. Let C be a configuration of Φ. We show that
it also configures norm(Φ). Let S be the simple
solved form of Φ that is configured by C (Lemma 1),
and S0 be a minimal solved form of Φ which is more
general than S.
Let X : f (Y1,...,Yn) be the top-most fragment of
the tree S. This fragment must also be the top-most
fragment of S0, which is a tree since Φ is assumed to
be weakly connected (Prop. 2). S0 is constructed by
our algorithm (Theorem 1), so that the evaluation of
solve(Φ) must choose X as free root in Φ.
Since Φ is a net, some literal X : f (Y1,...,Yn) must
belong to Φ. Let Φ0 = Φ|{X,Y1,...,Yn} be the restriction
of Φ to the lower fragments. The weakly connected
components of all Y1, ..., Yn−1 must be pairwise dis-
joint by F2 (which holds by Lemma 2 since X is free
in Φ). The X-fragment of net Φ must satisfy one of
three possible schemata of net fragments:

weak fragments: there exists a unique weak domi-
nance edge X &lt;* Z in Φ and a unique hole Yn without
outgoing dominance edges. The variable Z must be a
root in Φ and thus be labeled. If Z is equal to X then
Φ is unsatisfiable by normality condition N2, which
is impossible. Hence, Z occurs in the restriction Φ�
but not in the weakly connected components of any
Y1, ..., Yn−1. Otherwise, the minimal solved form S�
could not be configured since the hole Yn could not
be identified with any root. Furthermore, the root of
the Z-component must be identified with Yn in any
configuration of Φ with root X. Hence, C satisfies
Yn &lt;* Z which is add by normalization.
The restriction Φ� must be a dominance net by
Lemma 3, and hence, all its weakly connected com-
ponents are nets. For all 1 &lt; i &lt; n − 1, the compo-
nent of Yi in Φ� is configured by the subtree of C at
node Yi, while the subtree of C at node Yn configures
the component of Z in Φ�. The induction hypothesis
yields that the normalizations of all these compo-
nents are configured by the respective subconfigura-
tions of C. Hence, norm(Φ) is configured by C.
strong or island fragments are not altered by nor-
malization, so we can recurse to the lower fragments
(if there exist any).
Proposition 4. Minimal solved forms of normal,
weakly connected dominance nets have configura-
tions.
Proof. By induction over the construction of min-
imal solved forms, we can show that all holes of
minimal solved forms have a unique outgoing dom-
inance edge at each hole. Furthermore, all minimal
solved forms are trees since we assumed connect-
edness (Prop.2). Thus, all minimal solved forms are
simple, so they have configurations (Lemma 1).

<bodyText confidence="0.999941333333333">
We have related two underspecification formalism,
MRS and normal dominance constraints. We have
distinguished the sublanguages of MRS-nets and
normal dominance nets that are sufficient to model
scope underspecification, and proved their equiva-
lence. Thereby, we have obtained the first provably
efficient algorithm to enumerate the readings of un-
derspecified semantic representations in MRS.
Our encoding has the advantage that researchers
interested in dominance constraints can benefit from
the large grammar resources of MRS. This requires
further work in order to deal with unrestricted ver-
sions of MRS used in practice. Conversely, one can
now lift the additional modeling power of CLLS to
MRS.

Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al., 1999) is the standard formalism for semantic underspecification used in large-scale HPSG grammars (Pollard and Sag, 1994; Copestake and Flickinger, ). Despite this clear relevance, the most obvious questions about MRS are still open: 1. Is it possible to enumerate the readings of MRS structures efficiently? No algorithm has been published so far. Existing implementations seem to be practical, even though the problem whether an MRS has a reading is NPcomplete (Althaus et al., 2003, Theorem 10.1). 2. What is the precise relationship to other underspecification formalism? Are all of them the same, or else, what are the differences?

These EP-conjunctions can be replaced in a preprocessing step introducing additional EPs that make conjunctions explicit. Second, our outscope constraints are slightly less restrictive than the original “qeq-constraints.” A handle h is qeq to a handle h&apos; in an MRS M, h =q h&apos;, if either h = h&apos; or a quantifier h:Q,(h1,h2) occurs in M and h2 is qeq to h&apos; in M. Thus, h =q h&apos; implies h &lt; h&apos;, but not the other way round. We believe that the additional strength of qeq-constraints is not needed in practice for modeling scope.

We present the first provably efficient algorithm to enumerate the readings of MRS structures, by translating them into normal dominance constraints. 1 Introduction In the past few years there has been considerable activity in the development of formalisms for underspecified semantics (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992; Reyle, 1993; Bos, 1996; Copestake et al., 1999; Egg et al., 2001). The common idea is to delay the enumeration of all readings for as long as possible. Instead, they work with a compact underspecified representation; readings are enumerated from this representation by need. Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al., 1999) is the standard formalism for semantic underspecification used in large-scale HPSG grammars (Pollard and Sag, 1994; Copestake and Flickinger, ).

The translation also answers the second question restricted to pure scope underspecification. It shows the equivalence of a large fragment of MRSs and a corresponding fragment of normal dominance constraints, which in turn is equivalent to a large fragment of Hole Semantics (Bos, 1996) as proven in (Koller et al., 2003). Additional underspecified treatments of ellipsis or reinterpretation, however, are available for extensions of dominance constraint only (CLLS, the constraint language for lambda structures (Egg et al., 2001)). Our results are subject to a new proof technique which reduces reasoning about MRS structures to reasoning about weakly normal dominance constraints (Bodirsky et al., 2003). The previous proof techniques for normal dominance constraints (Koller et al., 2003) do not apply. 2 Minimal Recursion Semantics We define a simplified version of Minimal Recursion Semantics and discuss differences to the original definitions presented in (Copestake et al., 1999).

Note that solutions may contain additional material. The tree f(a,b), for instance, satisfies the constraint Y :a n Z:b. 3.2 Normality and Weak Normality The satisfiability problem of arbitrary dominance constraints is NP-complete (Koller et al., 2001) in general. However, Althaus et al. (2003) identify a natural fragment of so called normal dominance constraints, which have a polynomial time satisfiability problem. Bodirsky et al. (2003) generalize this notion to weakly normal dominance constraints. We call a variable a hole of ϕ if it occurs in argument position in ϕ and a root of ϕ otherwise. Definition 3. A dominance constraint ϕ is normal (and compact) if it satisfies the following conditions. N1 (a) each variable of ϕ occurs at most once in the labeling literals of ϕ. (b) each variable of ϕ occurs at least once in the labeling literal</context>

We distinguish the sublanguages of MRS nets and normal dominance nets, and show that they can be intertranslated. This translation answers the first question: existing constraint solvers for normal dominance constraints can be used to enumerate the readings of MRS nets in low polynomial time.

The requirement of hypernormal connections in islands replaces the notion of chain-connectedness in (Koller et al., 2003), which fails to apply to dominance constraints with weak dominance edges. For ease of presentation, we restrict ourselves to a simple version of island fragments. In general, we should allow for island fragments with n &gt; 1. 6.3 Normalizing Dominance Nets Dominance nets are wnd-constraints. We next translate dominance nets Φ to normal dominance constraints Φ0 so that Φ has a configuration iff Φ0 is satisfiable. The trick is to normalize weak dominance edges.
