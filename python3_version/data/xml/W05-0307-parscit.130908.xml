We present a framework for the integrated

availability, organisation and salience of
entities in a discourse model. We present
standards for the annotation of informa-

give guidelines for annotating informa-
tion structure, i.e. theme/rheme and back-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999888875">
We present a framework for the integrated analysis
of the textual and prosodic characteristics of infor-
mation structure in a corpus of conversational En-
glish. Section 2 introduces the corpus as well as the
tools we employ in the annotation process. We pro-
pose two complementary annotation efforts within
this framework. The first, information status (old,
mediated, new), expresses the availability of entities
in discourse (Section 3). The second scheme will
firstly annotate theme/rheme, i.e. how each intona-
tion phrase is organised in the discourse model, and
secondly kontrast: how salient the speaker wishes
to make each entity, property or relation (Section 4).
We will demonstrate that the perception of both of
these is intimately affected by prosodic structure. In
particular, the theme/rheme division affects prosodic
phrasing; and information status and kontrast affect
relative prosodic prominence. Therefore we also
propose to annotate a subset of the corpus for this
prosodic information (Section 5). In conjunction
with existing annotations of the corpus, our inte-
grated framework using NXT will be unique in the
field of conversational speech in terms of size and
richness of annotation.

2 Corpus and Tools
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986196727272727">
The Switchboard Corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992) con-
sists of 2430 spontaneous phone conversations (av-
erage six minutes), between speakers of American
English, for three million words. The corpus is
distributed as stereo speech signals with an ortho-
graphic transcription per channel time-stamped at
the word level. A third of this is syntactically parsed
as part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993)
and has dialog act annotation (Shriberg et al., 1998).
We used a subset of this. In adherence with current
standards, we converted all the existing annotations,
and are producing the new discourse annotations in
a coherent multi-layered XML-conformant schema,
using NXT technology (Carletta et al., 2004).1 This
allows us to search over and integrate information
from the many layers of annotation, including the
&apos;Beside the NXT tools, we also used the TIGER Switch-
board filter (Mengel and Lezius, 2000) for the XML-
conversion. Using existing markup we automatically selected
and filtered NPs to be annotated, excluding locative, directional,
and adverbial NPs and disfluencies, and adding possessive pro-
nouns. See (Nissim et al., 2004) for technical details.

want to add, including data sets that have low-level
annotations time-stamped against a set of synchro-

3 Information Status
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999182">
Information Status describes how available an en-
tity is in the discourse. We define this in terms of
the speaker’s assumptions about the hearer’s knowl-
edge/beliefs, and we express it by the well-known
old/new distinction.2
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998825">
3.1 Annotation Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999427103448276">
Our annotation scheme for the discourse layer
mainly builds on (Prince, 1992) and (Eckert and
Strube, 2001), as well as on related work on
annotation of anaphoric links (Passonneau, 1996;
Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997; Davies et al., 1998;
Poesio, 2000). Prince defines “old” and “new” with
respect to the discourse model as well as the hearer’s
point of view. Considering the interaction of both
these aspects, we define as new an entity which has
not been previously referred to and is yet unknown
to the hearer, and as mediated an entity that is newly
mentioned in the dialogue but that the hearer can in-
fer from the prior context.3 This is mainly the case
of generally known entities (such as “the sun”, or
“the Pope” (L¨obner, 1985)), and bridging (Clark,
1975), where an entity is related to a previously in-
troduced one. Whenever an entity is not new nor
mediated is considered as old.
Because finer-grained distinctions (e.g. (Prince,
1981; Lambrecht, 1994)) have proved hard to distin-
guish reliably in practice, we organise our scheme
hierarchically: we use the three main classes de-
scribed above as top level categories for which more
specific subtypes can assigned. This approach pre-
serves a high-level, more reliable distinction while
allowing a finer-grained classification that can be ex-
ploited for specific tasks.
Besides the main categories, we introduce two
more classes. A category non-applicable is used for

2We follow Prince in using “ old” rather than “given” to refer
to “not-new” information, but regard the two as identical.
3This type corresponds to Prince’s (1981; 1992) inferrables.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.894663243902439">
wrongly extracted markables (such as “course” in
“of course”), for idiomatic occurrences, and exple-
tive uses of “it”. Traces are automatically extracted
as markables, but are left unannotated. In the rare
event the annotators find some fragments too diffi-
cult to understand, a category not-understood can be
assigned. Entities marked as non-applicable or not-
understood are excluded from any further annotation.
For all other markables, the annotators must choose
between old, mediated, and new. For the first two,
subtypes can also be specified: subtype assignment
is encouraged but not compulsory.
New The category new is assigned to entities that
have not yet been introduced in the dialogue and that
the hearer cannot infer from previously mentioned
entities. No subtypes are specified for this category.
Mediated Mediated entities are inferrable from
previously mentioned ones, or generally known to
the hearer. We specify nine subtypes: general, bound,
part, situation, event, set, poss, func value, aggrega-
tion.4 Generally known entities such as “the moon”
or “Italy” are assigned a subtype general. Most
proper nouns fall into this subclass, but the anno-
tator could opt for a different tag, depending on the
context. Also mediated are bound pronouns, such as
“them” in (1), which are assigned a subtype bound.5
(1) [... ] it’s hard to raise one child without them
thinking they’re the pivot point of the universe.
A subtype poss is used to mark all kinds of intra-
phrasal possessive relations (pre- and postnominal).
Four subtypes (part, situation, event, and set) are
used to mark instances of bridging. The subtype part
is used to mark part-whole relations for physical ob-
jects, both as intra- and inter-phrasal relations. (This
category is to be preferred to poss whenever appli-
cable.) The occurrence of “the door” in (2), for in-
stance, is annotated as mediated/part.
(2) When I come home in the evenings my dog
greets me at the door.
For similar relations that do not involve physical ob-
jects, i.e. if an entity is part of a situation set up by

4Some of the subtypes are inspired by categories developed
for bridging markup (Passonneau, 1996; Davies et al., 1998).

SAll examples in this paper are from the Switchboard Cor-
pus. The markable in question is typed in boldface; antecedents
or trigger entities, where present, are in italics. For the sake of
space we do not provide examples for each category (see (Nis-
sim, 2003)).

a previously introduced entity, we use the subtype
situation.6,as for the NP “the specifications” in (3).
(3) I guess I don’t really have a problem with cap-
ital punishment. I’m not really sure what the
exact specifications are for Texas.
The subtype event is applied whenever an entity is
related to a previously mentioned verb phrase (VP).
In (4), e.g., “the bus” is triggered by travelling
around Yucatan.
(4) We were travelling around Yucatan, and the
bus was really full.
Whenever an entity referred to is a subset of, a super-
set of, or a member of the same set as a previously
mentioned entity, the subtype set is applied.
Rarely, an entity refers to a value of a previously
mentioned function, as “zero” and “ten” in (5). In
such cases a subtype func-value is assigned.
(5) I had kind of gotten used to centigrade temper-
ature [... ] if it’s between zero and ten it’s cold.
Lastly, a subtype aggregation is used to classify co-
ordinated NPs. Two old or med entities, for instance
do not give rise to an old coordinated NP, unless it
has been previously introduced as such. A medi-
ated/aggregation tag is assigned instead.
Old An entity is old when it is not new nor medi-
ated. This is usually the case if an entity is coref-
erential with an already introduced entity, if it is
a generic pronoun, or if it is a personal pronoun
referring to the dialogue participants. Six differ-
ent subtypes are available for old entities: identity,
event, general, generic, ident generic, relative. In (6),
for instance, “us” would be marked as old because it
corefers with “we”, and a subtype identity would also
be assigned.

<listItem confidence="0.797903">
(6) [... ] we camped in a tent, and uh there were
two other couples with us.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.972918457142857">
In addition, a coreference link is marked up between
anaphor and antecedent, thus creating anaphoric
chains (see also (Carletta et al., 2004)). The subtype
event applies whenever the antecedent is a VP. In (7),
“it” is old/event, as its antecedent is the VP “educate
three”. As we do not extract VPs as markables, no
link can be marked up.
(7) I most certainly couldn’t educate three. I don’t
know how my parents did it.
6This includes elements of the thematic grid of an already
introduced entity. It subsumes Passonneau’s (1996) class “arg”.
Also classified as old are personal pronouns refer-
ring to the dialogue participants as well as generic
pronouns. In the first case, a subtype general is spec-
ified, whereas the subtype for the second is generic.
An instance of old/generic is “you” in (8).
(8) up here you got to wait until Aug- August until
the water warms up.
In a chain of generic references, the subtype
ident generic is assigned, and a coreference link is
marked up. Coreference is also marked up for rel-
ative pronouns: they receive a subtype relative and
are linked back to their head.
The guidelines contain a decision tree the annota-
tors use to establish priority in case more than one
class is appropriate for a given entity. For example,
if a mediated/general entity is also old/identity the latter
is to be preferred to the former. Similar precedence
relations hold among subtypes.
To provide more robust and reliable clues in an-
notating bridging types (e.g. for distinguishing
between poss and part), we provided replacement
tests and referred to relations encoded in knowledge
bases such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) (for part)
and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) (for situation).

3.2 Validation of the Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969587380952381">
Three Switchboard dialogues (for a total of 1738
markables) were marked up by two different anno-
tators for assessing the validity of the scheme. We
evaluated annotation reliability by using the Kappa
statistic (Carletta, 1996). Good quality annotation
of discourse phenomena normally yields a kappa
( ) of about .80. We assessed the validity of the
scheme on the four-way classification into the three
main categories (old, mediated and new) and the non-
applicable category. We also evaluated the annota-
tion including the subtypes. All cases where at least
one annotator assigned a not-understood tag were ex-
cluded from the agreement evaluation (14 mark-
ables). Also excluded were all traces (222 mark-
ables), which the annotators left unmarked. The
total markables considered for evaluation over the
three dialogues was therefore 1502.
The annotation of the three dialogues yielded
for the high-level categories, and

These results show that overall the annotation is re-
liable and that therefore the scheme has good repro-
ducibility. When including subtypes agreement de-
creases, but backing-off to the high-level categories
is always possible, thus showing the virtues of a hi-
erarchically organised scheme. Reliability tests for
single categories showed that mediated and new are
more difficult to apply than old, for which agree-
ment was measured at , although still quite
reliable ( and , respectively).
Agreement for non-applicable was .
The annotators found the decision tree very useful
when having to choose between more than one ap-
plicable subtype, and we believe it has a significant
impact on the reliability of the scheme.
The scheme was then applied for the annotation of
a total of 147 Switchboard dialogues. This amounts
to 43358 sentences with 69004 annotated markables,
35299 of which are old, 23816 mediated and 9889
new (8127 were excluded as non-applicable, and 160
were not understood), and 16324 coreference links.
In Section 6 we use this scheme to annotate the
Pie-in-the-Sky text.

3.3 Related Work

<bodyText confidence="0.999970153846154">
To our knowledge, (Eckert and Strube, 2001) is
the only other work that explicitly refers to IS an-
notation. They also use a Prince’s (1992)-based
old/med/new distinction for annotating Switchboard
dialogues. However, their IS annotation is specif-
ically designed for salience ranking of candidate
antecedents for anaphora resolution, and not de-
scribed in detail. They do not report figures on
inter-annotator agreement so that a proper compar-
ison with our experiment is not feasible. Among
the schemes that deal with annotation of anaphoric
NPs, our scheme is especially comparable with
DRAMA (Passonneau, 1996) and MATE (Davies
et al., 1998). Both schemes have a hierarchical
structure. In DRAMA, types of inferrables can be
specified, within a division into conceptual (prag-
matically determined) vs. linguistic (based on ar-
gument structure) inference. No annotation experi-
ment with inter-annotator agreement figures is how-
ever reported. MATE provides subtypes for bridg-
ing relations, but they were not applied in any anno-
tation excercise, so that reliability and distribution
of categories are only based on the “core scheme”
(true coreference). For a detailed comparison of our
approach with related efforts on the annotation of
anaphoric relations, see (Nissim et al., 2004).

4 Information Structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969375">
We have seen that information status describes how
available an entity is in a discourse. Generally old
entities are available, and new entities are not. In
prosody we find that newness is highly correlated
with pitch accenting, and oldness with deaccent-
ing (Cutler et al., 1997). However, this is only
one aspect of information structure. We also need
to describe how speakers signal the organisation
and salience of elements in discourse. Building on
the work of (Vallduvi&amp; Vilkuna, 1998), as devel-
oped by (Steedman, 2000), we define two notions,
theme/rheme structure and background/kontrast.
Theme/rheme structure guides how an element fits
into the discourse model: if it relates back it is the-
matic; if it advances the discourse it is rhematic.
Steedman claims that intonational phrases can mark
information units (theme and rheme - though not
all boundaries are realised and a unit may contain
more than one phrase). The pitch contour associated
with nuclear accents in themes is distinct from that
in rhemes (which he identifies as L+H*LH% and
H*LH% re ToBI (Beckman and Elam, 1997)), so
that, where present, such boundaries disambiguate
information structure. (See (9)).8

The second dimension, kontrast, relates to salience.9
We expect new entities to be salient and old entities
not. Therefore, if an old element is salient, or a new
one especially salient, an extra meaning is implied.

4.1 Annotation Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983575">
As we have seen, in English, information structure
is primarily conveyed by intonation. We therefore
think it is vital for annotators to listen to the speech
while annotating this structure.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.774146">
4.1.1 Theme/Rheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975155407407407">
We have claimed that prosodic phrasing can divide
utterances into information units. However, often
theme material is entirely background, i.e., mutually
known and without contrasting alternatives. There-
fore, for both model theoretic and practical pur-
poses, it is the same as background of the rheme.
Accordingly, we work with a test for themehood,
defining the rheme as any prosodic phrase that is
not identifiable as a theme.
Annotators will mark each prosodic phrase as a
theme if it only contains information which links the
utterance to the preceding context, i.e. setting up
what they’re saying in relation to what’s been said
before. In their opinion, even if this is not the tune
the speaker used, it must sound appropriate if they
say it with a highly marked tune, such as L+H*
LH%. For example, in (10), the phrase “where I
lived” links “was a town called Newmarket” to the
statement the speaker lived in England (accenting
not shown). It would be appropriate to utter it with
an L+H* accent on “Where” and/or “lived,”, and a
final LH%. So it is a theme. The same accent on
“town” and/or “Newmarket” sounds inappropriate,
and it advances the discussion, so it is a rheme.

4.1.2 Background/Kontrast
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997034739130435">
Although there is a clear link between prosodic
prominence and kontrast, there are a number of dis-
agreements about how this works which this annota-
tion effort seeks to resolve. Some, including (Steed-
man, 2000), have claimed that kontrast within theme
and kontrast within rheme are marked by categor-
ically distinct pitch accents. Another view is that
kontrast, also called contrastive focus or topic, only
applies to themes that are contrastive; the head of
a rheme phrase always attracts a pitch accent, it is
therefore redundant to call one part kontrastive. Fur-
ther, some consider kontrast within a rheme phrase
only occurs when there is a clear alternative set, i.e.
the distinction between broad and narrow focus, as
in (9) where daffodil contrasts with other bulbs the
speaker might grow. Again, there is controversy on
whether there is an intonational difference between
broad and narrow focus (Calhoun, 2004a). If these
distinctions are marked prosodically, it is disputed
whether this is with different pitch accents (Steed-
man), or by the relative height of different accents in
a phrase (Rump and Collier, 1996; Calhoun, 2004b).
Rather than using the abstract notion of kontrast
directly, annotators will identify discourse scenar-
ios which commonly invoke kontrast (drawing on
functions of emphatic accents from (Brenier et al.,
2005)).10 This addresses the disagreements above,
while making our annotation more constrained and
robust. In each case, using the full discourse context
including the speech, annotators mark each content
word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb and demonstra-
tive pronoun) for the first category that applies. If
none apply, they mark it as background.
correction The speaker’s intent is to correct or
clarify another just used by them or the other
speaker. In (11), e.g., the speaker wishes to clarify
whether her interlocutor really meant “hyacinths”.
(11) (now are you sure they’re HYACINTHS) (be-
cause that is a BULB)
contrastive The speaker intends to contrast the
word with a previous one which was (a) a cur-
rent topic; (b) semantically related to the contrastive
word, such that they belong to a natural set. In (12),
B contrasts recycling in her town “San Antonio”,
with A’s town “Garland”, from the set places where
the speakers live.

Annotator agreement for pitch accents and prosodic
boundaries, re ToBI, is about 80% and 90% respec-
tively (Pitrelli et al., 1994). Automatic performance,
using acoustic and textual features, is now above
85% accuracy (Shriberg et al., 2000). However, this
does not distinguish prosodic events which occur for
structural or rhythmical reasons from those which
mark information structure (Ladd, 1996). (Heldner
et al., 1999) try to predict focal accents. They de-
fine this minimally as the most prominent in a three-
word phrase. (Hirschberg, 1993) got 80-98% accu-
racy using only text-based features. However, her
definition of contrast was not as thorough as ours.
(Hedberg and Sosa, 2001) looked at marking of rat-
ified, unratified (old and new) and contrastive topics
and foci (theme and rheme) with ToBI pitch accents.
(Baumann et al., 2004) annotated a simpler informa-

5 Information Structure and Prosodic
Structure
Much previous work, not corpus-based, draws a di-
rect correspondence between information structure,
prosodic phrasing and pitch accent type. However
in real speech there are many non-semantic influ-
ences on prosody, including phrase length, speaking
rate and rhythm. Information structure is rather a
strong constraint on the realisation of prosodic struc-
ture (Calhoun, 2004a). Contrary to the assumption
of ToBI, this structure is metrical, highly structured
and linguistically relevant both within and across
prosodic phrases (Ladd, 1996; Truckenbrodt, 2002).
One of our main aims is to test how such ev-
idence can be reconciled with theories presented
earlier about the relationship between information
structure and prosody. Local prominence levels have
been shown to aid in the disambiguation of focal ad-
verbs, anaphoric links, and global discourse struc-
tures marked as elaboration, continuation, and con-
trast (Dogil et al., 1997). Global measures of promi-
nence level have been linked to topic structure, cor-
rections, and turn-taking cues (Ayers, 1994). (Bre-
nier et al., 2005) found that emphatic accents re-
alised special discourse functions such as assess-
ment, clarification, contrast, negation and protest in
child-directed speech. Most of these functions can
be seen as conversational implicatures of kontrast,
i.e. if an element is unexpectedly highlighted, this
implies an added meaning. Brenier found that while
pitch accents can be detected using both acoustic
and textual cues; textual features are not useful in
detecting emphatic pitch accents, showing there is
added meaning not available from the text.
As noted in Section (4.2), inter-annotator agree-
ment for the identification of prosodic phrase bound-
aries with ToBI is reasonably good. We will there-
fore label ToBI break indices 3 and 4 (conflated)
(Beckman and Elam, 1997). Annotators will also
mark the perceived level of prosodic prominence on
each word using a defined scale. We are currently
running a pilot experiment to identify a reasonable
number of gradations of prosodic prominence, from
completely unstressed and/or reduced to highly em-
phatic, to use for the final annotation.

6 Pie-in-the-Sky annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975013053571429">
“Pie in the Sky” is a joint effort to annotate two
sentences with as much semantic/pragmatic in-
formation as possible (see http://nlp.cs.nyu.
edu/meyers/pie-in-the-sky.html). Information
structure is one of the desired annotation layers.
And, as standards are not yet established, our pro-
posal contributes to defining annotation guidelines
for this structure. Figure 1 report the Pie-in-the-sky
sentences enriched with our annotation. The context
prior to these sentences is as follows:
“a 12-year-old boy reports seeing a man launch a rubber boat
from a car parked at the harbor. fbi officials find what they be-
lieve may be explosives in the car. yemeni police trace the car
to a nearby house. the fbi finds traces of explosives on clothes
found neighbors say they saw two men who they describe as
”arab-looking” living there for several weeks. police also find
a second house where authorities believe two others may have
assembled the bomb, possibly doing some welding. passports
found in one of the houses identify the men as from a privilege
convenience province noted for lawless tribes. but the docu-
ments turn out to be fakes. meantime, analysts at the fbi crime
lab try to discover what the bomb was made from. no con-
clusions yet, u.s. officials say. but a working theory, plastic
explosive.”
We identified 14 NPs markable for information sta-
tus (see Figure 1).11 Most annotations were straight-
forward. Some comments though: “Yemen” is an-
notated as med/general, although it could also be
med/sit as “Yemeni” was previously mentioned. Our
decision tree was used for such cases. “The explo-
sive material” is med/set not old/identity since it refers
to the kind of explosive used rather than to a specific
entity previously mentioned.
In the absence of any prosodic annotation in the
transcript, these sentences are slightly ambiguous
as to information structure. The most likely in-
terpretation is given in Figure 1.12 For example,
“Yemen’s President” contrasts with “US officials”,

in the set of people talking about what the bomb is
made of. Since both words are contrastive, either
or both could have L+H* accents, whereas “say”
could not. The inclusion of the latter in the theme
is consistent with the possibility of a rising bound-
ary LH% after it. “The FBI has told him” is the-
matic because it links “Yemen’s president”’s opinion
to the previous discourse. It also would sound ap-
propriate with an L+H*LH% tune. As can be seen,
although theme/rheme and prosodic phrase bound-
aries align, in both cases the VP is split between in-
formation/intonation phrases. The independence of
information structure and intonation structure from
traditional surface structure is a major reason behind
our use of ‘stand-off’ markup.

Once completed, the annotations we have presented,
along with those existing for syntax, disfluencies
and dialog-acts on the same portion of Switchboard,
will create a corpus of conversational speech unique
in terms of size and richness of annotation. In con-
junction with the NXT tools, this resource would
optimally lend itself to detailed and rich analysis
of diverse linguistic phenomena, the ultimate goal
of the Pie in the Sky project. It will be useful for
a large range of NLP applications, including para-
phrase analysis and generation, topic detection, in-
formation extraction and speech synthesis in dia-
logue systems.

The guidelines contain a decision tree the annotators use to establish priority in case more than one class is appropriate for a given entity. For example, if a mediated/general entity is also old/identity the latter is to be preferred to the former. Similar precedence relations hold among subtypes. To provide more robust and reliable clues in annotating bridging types (e.g. for distinguishing between poss and part), we provided replacement tests and referred to relations encoded in knowledge bases such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) (for part) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) (for situation). 3.2 Validation of the Scheme Three Switchboard dialogues (for a total of 1738 markables) were marked up by two different annotators for assessing the validity of the scheme. We evaluated annotation reliability by using the Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996). Good quality annotation of discourse phenomena normally yields a kappa ( ) of about .80. We assessed the validity of the scheme on the four-way classification into the three main categories (old, mediated and new) and the nonapplicable category.

Theme/rheme structure guides how an element fits into the discourse model: if it relates back it is thematic; if it advances the discourse it is rhematic. Steedman claims that intonational phrases can mark information units (theme and rheme - though not all boundaries are realised and a unit may contain more than one phrase). The pitch contour associated with nuclear accents in themes is distinct from that in rhemes (which he identifies as L+H*LH% and H*LH% re ToBI (Beckman and Elam, 1997)), so that, where present, such boundaries disambiguate information structure.

Again, there is controversy on whether there is an intonational difference between broad and narrow focus (Calhoun, 2004a). If these distinctions are marked prosodically, it is disputed whether this is with different pitch accents (Steedman), or by the relative height of different accents in a phrase (Rump and Collier, 1996; Calhoun, 2004b). Rather than using the abstract notion of kontrast directly, annotators will identify discourse scenarios which commonly invoke kontrast (drawing on functions of emphatic accents from (Brenier et al., 2005)).10 This addresses the disagreements above, while making our annotation more constrained and robust. In each case, using the full discourse context including the speech, annotators mark each content word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb and demonstrative pronoun) for the first category that applies. If none apply, they mark it as background. correction The speaker’s intent is to correct or clarify another just used by them or the other speaker.

To provide more robust and reliable clues in annotating bridging types (e.g. for distinguishing between poss and part), we provided replacement tests and referred to relations encoded in knowledge bases such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) (for part) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) (for situation). 3.2 Validation of the Scheme Three Switchboard dialogues (for a total of 1738 markables) were marked up by two different annotators for assessing the validity of the scheme. We evaluated annotation reliability by using the Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996). Good quality annotation of discourse phenomena normally yields a kappa ( ) of about .80. We assessed the validity of the scheme on the four-way classification into the three main categories (old, mediated and new) and the nonapplicable category. We also evaluated the annotation including the subtypes. All cases where at least one annotator assigned a not-understood tag were excluded from the agreement evaluation (14 markables). Also excluded were all traces (222 markables), which the annotators left unmarked. The total markables considered for evaluation over the three dialogues was therefor</context>

In particular, the theme/rheme division affects prosodic phrasing; and information status and kontrast affect relative prosodic prominence.

This approach preserves a high-level, more reliable distinction while allowing a finer-grained classification that can be exploited for specific tasks.

Generally old entities are available, and new entities are not. In prosody we find that newness is highly correlated with pitch accenting, and oldness with deaccenting (Cutler et al., 1997). However, this is only one aspect of information structure. We also need to describe how speakers signal the organisation and salience of elements in discourse.

They do not report figures on inter-annotator agreement so that a proper comparison with our experiment is not feasible. Among the schemes that deal with annotation of anaphoric NPs, our scheme is especially comparable with DRAMA (Passonneau, 1996) and MATE (Davies et al., 1998).

Further, some consider kontrast within a rheme phrase only occurs when there is a clear alternative set, i.e. the distinction between broad and narrow focus, as in (9) where daffodil contrasts with other bulbs the speaker might grow. Again, there is controversy on whether there is an intonational difference between broad and narrow focus (Calhoun, 2004a). If these distinctions are marked prosodically, it is disputed whether this is with different pitch accents (Steedman), or by the relative height of different accents in a phrase (Rump and Collier, 1996; Calhoun, 2004b). Rather than using the abstract notion of kontrast directly, annotators will identify discourse scenarios which commonly invoke kontrast (drawing on functions of emphatic accents from (Brenier et al., 2005)).10 This addresses the disagreements above, while making our annotation more constrained and robust. In each case, using the full discourse context including the speech, annotators mark each content word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb and demonstrative pronoun) for the first category that applies. If none apply, they mark it as background. correction The speaker’s intent i</context>

The corpus is distributed as stereo speech signals with an orthographic transcription per channel time-stamped at the word level. A third of this is syntactically parsed as part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and has dialog act annotation (Shriberg et al., 1998). We used a subset of this. In adherence with current standards, we converted all the existing annotations, and are producing the new discourse annotations in a coherent multi-layered XML-conformant schema, using NXT technology (Carletta et al., 2004).1 This allows us to search over and integrate information from the many layers of annotation, including the &apos;Beside the NXT tools, we also used the TIGER Switchboard filter (Mengel and Lezius, 2000) for the XMLconversion. Using existing markup we automatically selected and filtered NPs to be annotated, excluding locative, directional, and adverbi</context>

Generally old entities are available, and new entities are not. In prosody we find that newness is highly correlated with pitch accenting, and oldness with deaccenting (Cutler et al., 1997). However, this is only one aspect of information structure. We also need to describe how speakers signal the organisation and salience of elements in discourse. Building on the work of (Vallduvi&amp; Vilkuna, 1998), as developed by (Steedman, 2000), we define two notions, theme/rheme structure and background/kontrast. Theme/rheme structure guides how an element fits into the discourse model: if it relates back it is thematic; if it advances the discourse it is rhematic. Steedman claims that intonational phrases can mark information units (theme and rheme - though not all boundaries are realised and a unit may contain more than one phrase). The pitch contour associated with nuclear accents in themes is distinct from that in rhemes (which he identifies as L+H*LH% and H*LH% re ToBI (Beckman and Elam, 1997)), so that, where present, such bo</context>

It would be appropriate to utter it with an L+H* accent on “Where” and/or “lived,”, and a final LH%. So it is a theme. The same accent on “town” and/or “Newmarket” sounds inappropriate, and it advances the discussion, so it is a rheme.

Some, including (Steedman, 2000), have claimed that kontrast within theme and kontrast within rheme are marked by categorically distinct pitch accents. Another view is that kontrast, also called contrastive focus or topic, only applies to themes that are contrastive; the head of a rheme phrase always attracts a pitch accent, it is therefore redundant to call one part kontrastive. Further, some consider kontrast within a rheme phrase only occurs when there is a clear alternative set, i.e. the distinction between broad and narrow focus, as in (9) where daffodil contrasts with other bulbs the speaker might grow.

However in real speech there are many non-semantic influences on prosody, including phrase length, speaking rate and rhythm. Information structure is rather a strong constraint on the realisation of prosodic structure (Calhoun, 2004a). Contrary to the assumption of ToBI, this structure is metrical, highly structured and linguistically relevant both within and across prosodic phrases (Ladd, 1996; Truckenbrodt, 2002). One of our main aims is to test how such evidence can be reconciled with theories presented earlier about the relationship between information structure and prosody. Local prominence levels have been shown to aid in the disambiguation of focal adverbs, anaphoric links, and global discourse structures marked as elaboration, continuation, and contrast (Dogil et al., 1997). Global measures of prominence level have been linked to topic structure, corrections, and turn-taking cues (Ayers, 1994). (Brenier et al., 2005) found that emphatic accents realised special discourse functions such as assess</context>
