Elements of the history, state of the art, and probable future of Machine Translation (MT) are
discussed. The treatment is largely tutorial, based on the assumption that this audience is, for the most
part, ignorant of matters pertaining to translation in general, and MT in particular. The paper covers
some of the major MT R&amp;D groups, the general techniques they employ(ed), and the roles they
play(ed) in the development of the field. The conclusions concern the seeming permanence of the
translation problem, and potential re-integration of MT with mainstream Computational Linguistics.

INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.970861377358491">
Machine Translation (MT) of natural human languages is
not a subject about which most scholars feel neutral.
This field has had a long, colorful career, and boasts no
shortage of vociferous detractors and proponents alike.
During its first decade in the 1950s, interest and support
was fueled by visions of high-speed high-quality trans-
lation of arbitrary texts (especially those of interest to the
military and intelligence communities, who funded MT
projects quite heavily). During its second decade in the
1960s, disillusionment crept in as the number and diffi-
culty of the linguistic problems became increasingly obvi-
ous, and as it was realized that the translation problem
was not nearly so amenable to automated solution as had
been thought. The climax came with the delivery of the
National Academy of Sciences ALPAC report in 1966,
condemning the field and, indirectly, its workers alike.
The ALPAC report was criticized as narrow, biased, and
short-sighted, but its recommendations were adopted
(with the important exception of increased expenditures
for long-term research in computational linguistics), and
as a result MT projects were cancelled in the U.S. and
elsewhere around the world. By 1973, the early part of
the third decade of MT, only three government-funded
projects were left in the U.S., and by late 1975 there were
none. Paradoxically, MT systems were still being used by
various government agencies here and abroad, because
there was simply no alternative means of gathering infor-
mation from foreign [Russian] sources so quickly; in
addition, private companies were developing and selling
MT systems based on the mid-60s technology so roundly
castigated by ALPAC. Nevertheless the general disrepute
of MT resulted in a remarkably quiet third decade.
We are now into the fourth decade of MT, and there is
a resurgence of interest throughout the world — plus a
growing number of MT and MAT (Machine-aided Trans-
lation) systems in use by governments, business and
industry: in 1984 approximately half a million pages of
text were translated by machine. Industrial firms are also
beginning to fund M(A)T R&amp;D projects of their own; thus
it can no longer be said that only government funding
keeps the field alive (indeed, in the U.S. there is no
government funding, though the Japanese and European
governments are heavily subsidizing MT R&amp;D). In part
this interest is due to more realistic expectations of what
is possible in MT, and realization that MT can be very
useful though imperfect; but it is also true that the capa-
bilities of the newer MT systems lie well beyond what
was possible just one decade ago.
In light of these events, it is worth reconsidering the
potential of, and prospects for, Machine Translation.

After opening with an explanation of how [human] trans-
lation is done where it is taken seriously, we present a
brief introduction to MT technology and a short historical
perspective before considering the present status and
state of the art, and then moving on to a discussion of the
future prospects. For reasons of space and perspicuity,
we shall concentrate on MT efforts in the U.S. and west-
ern Europe, though some other MT projects and less-am-

THE HUMAN TRANSLATION CONTEXT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955240740741">
When evaluating the feasibility or desirability of Machine
Translation, one should consider the endeavor in light of
the facts of human translation for like purposes. In the
U.S., it is common to conceive of translation as simply
that which a human translator does. It is generally
believed that a college degree [or the equivalent] in a
foreign language qualifies one to be a translator for just
about any material whatsoever. Native speakers of
foreign languages are considered to be that much more
qualified. Thus, translation is not particularly respected
as a profession in the U.S., and the pay is poor.
In Canada, in Europe, and generally around the world,
this myopic attitude is not held. Where translation is a
fact of life rather than an oddity, it is realized that any
translator&apos;s competence is sharply restricted to a few
domains (this is especially true of technical areas), and
that native fluency in a foreign language does not bestow
on one the ability to serve as a translator. Thus, there
are college-level and post-graduate schools that teach the
theory (translatology) as well as the practice of trans-
lation; thus, a technical translator is trained in the few
areas in which he will be doing translation.
Of special relevance to MT is the fact that essentially
all translations for dissemination (export) are revised by
more highly qualified translators who necessarily refer
back to the original text when post-editing the trans-
lation. (This is not &amp;quot;pre-publication stylistic editing&amp;quot;)
Unrevised translations are always regarded as inferior in
quality, or at least suspect, and for many if not most
purposes they are simply not acceptable. In the multi-na-
tional firm Siemens, even internal communications that
are translated are post-edited. Such news generally comes
as a surprise, if not a shock, to most people in the U.S.
It is easy to see, therefore, that the &amp;quot;fully-automatic
high-quality machine translation&amp;quot; standard, imagined by
most U.S. scholars to constitute minimum acceptability,
must be radically redefined. Indeed, the most famous MT
critic of all eventually recanted his strong opposition to
MT, admitting that these terms could only be defined by
the users, according to their own standards, for each situ-
ation (Bar-Hillel 1971). So an MT system does not have
to print and bind the result of its translation in order to
qualify as &amp;quot;fully automatic&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;High quality&amp;quot; does not at
all rule out post-editing, since the proscription of human
revision would &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; the infeasibility of high-quality
Human Translation. Academic debates about what
constitutes &amp;quot;high-quality&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fully-automatic&amp;quot; are
considered irrelevant by the users of Machine Translation
(MT) and Machine-aided Translation (MAT) systems;
what matters to them are two things: whether the
systems can produce output of sufficient quality for the
intended use (e.g., revision), and whether the operation
as a whole is cost-effective or, rarely, justifiable on other
grounds, like speed.

CATEGORIES OF SYSTEMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997708">
There are three broad categories of computerized trans-
lation tools (the differences hinging on how ambitious the
system is intended to be): Machine Translation (MT),
Machine-aided Translation (MAT), and Terminology
Data banks.
MT systems are intended to perform translation with-
out human intervention. This does not rule out pre-pro-
cessing (assuming this is not for the purpose of marking
phrase boundaries and resolving part-of-speech and/or
other ambiguities, etc.), nor post-editing (since this is
normally done for human translations anyway). Howev-
er, an MT system is solely responsible for the complete
translation process from input of the source text to
output of the target text without human assistance, using
special programs, comprehensive dictionaries, and
collections of linguistic rules (to the extent they exist,
varying with the MT system). MT occupies the top range
of positions on the scale of computer translation ambi-
tion.
MAT systems fall into two subgroups: human-assisted
machine translation (HAMT) and machine-assisted
human translation (MAHT). These occupy successively
lower ranges on the scale of computer translation ambi-
tion. HAMT refers to a system wherein the computer is
responsible for producing the translation per se, but may
interact with a human monitor at many stages along the
way — for example, asking the human to disambiguate a
word&apos;s part of speech or meaning, or to indicate where to
attach a phrase, or to choose a translation for a word or
phrase from among several candidates discovered in the
system&apos;s dictionary. MAHT refers to a system wherein
the human is responsible for producing the translation
per se (on-line), but may interact with the system in
certain prescribed situations — for example, requesting
assistance in searching through a local dictionary or

thesaurus, accessing a remote terminology data bank,
retrieving examples of the use of a word or phrase, or
performing word processing functions like formatting.
The existence of a pre-processing stage is unlikely in a
MA(H)T system (the system does not need help, instead,
it is making help available), but post-editing is frequently
appropriate.
Terminology Data banks (TD) are the least ambitious
systems because access frequently is not made during a
translation task (the translator may not be working
on-line), but usually is performed prior to human trans-
lation. Indeed the data bank may not be accessible (to
the translator) on-line at all, but may be limited to the
production of printed subject-area glossaries. A TD
offers access to technical terminology, but usually not to
common words (the user already knows these). The
chief advantage of a TD is not the fact that it is auto-
mated (even with on-line access, words can be found just
as quickly in a printed dictionary), but that it is up-to-
date: technical terminology is constantly changing and
published dictionaries are essentially obsolete by the time
they are available. It is also possible for a TD to contain
more entries because it can draw on a larger group of
active contributors: its users.

THE PURPOSES OF TRANSLATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963302325582">
The most immediate division of translation purposes
involves information acquisition versus dissemination.
The classic example of the former purpose is intelli-
gence-gathering: with masses of data to sift through,
there is no time, money, or incentive to carefully trans-
late every document by normal (i.e., human) means.
Scientists more generally are faced with this dilemma:
there is already more to read than can be read in the time
available, and having to labor through texts written in
foreign languages — when the probability is low that any
given text is of real interest — is not worth the effort. In
the past, the lingua franca of science has been English;
this is becoming less and less true for a variety of
reasons, including the rise of nationalism and the spread
of technology around the world. As a result, scientists
who rely on English are having greater, difficulty keeping
up with work in their fields. If a very rapid and inexpen-
sive means of translation were available, then — for texts
within the reader&apos;s areas of expertise — even a low-quali-
ty translation might be sufficient for information acquisi-
tion. At worst, the reader could determine whether a
more careful (and more expensive) translation effort
might be justified. More likely, he could understand the
content of the text well enough that a more careful trans-
lation would not be necessary.
The classic example of the latter purpose of translation
is technology export: an industry in one country that
desires to sell its products in another country must usual-
ly provide documentation in the purchaser&apos;s chosen
language. In the past, U.S. companies have escaped this
responsibility by requiring that the purchasers learn
English; other exporters (German, for example) have
never had such luxury. In the future, with the increase of
nationalism, it is less likely that English documentation
will be acceptable. Translation is becoming increasingly
common as more companies look to foreign markets.
More to the point, texts for information dissemination
(export) must be translated with a great deal of care: the
translation must be &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; as well as clear. Qualified
human technical translators are hard to find, expensive,
and slow (translating somewhere around 4 to 6 pages per
day, on the average). The information dissemination
application is most responsible for the renewed interest in

INTENDED APPLICATIONS OF M(A)T
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99971208">
Although literary translation is a case of information
dissemination, there is little or no demand for literary
translation by machine: relative to technical translation,
there is no shortage of human translators capable of
fulfilling this need, and in any case computers do not fare
well at literary translation. By contrast, the demand for
technical translation is staggering in sheer volume; more-
over, the acquisition, maintenance, and consistent use of
valid technical terminology is an enormous problem.
Worse, in many technical fields there is a distinct short-
age of qualified human translators, and it is obvious that
the problem will never be alleviated by measures such as
greater incentives for translators, however laudable that
may be. The only hope for a solution to the technical
translation problem lies with increased human productiv-
ity through computer technology: full-scale MT, less
ambitious MAT, on-line terminology data banks, and
word processing all have their place. A serendipitous
situation involves style: in literary translation, emphasis is
placed on style, perhaps at&apos;the expense of absolute fideli-
ty to content (especially for poetry). , In technical trans-
lation, emphasis is properly placed on fidelity, even at the
expense of style. M(A)T systems lack style but excel at
terminology: they are best suited for technical trans-
lation.

LINGUISTIC TECHNIQUES
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984404">
There are several perspectives from which one can view
MT techniques. We will use the following: direct versus
indirect; interlingua versus transfer; and local versus
global scope. (Not all eight combinations are realized in
practice.) We shall characterize MT systems from these
perspectives, in our discussions. In the past, &amp;quot;the use of
semantics&amp;quot; was always used to distinguish MT systems;
those which used semantics were labelled &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;, and
those which did not were labelled &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot;. Now all MT
systems are claimed to make use of semantics, for obvi-
ous reasons, so this is no longer a distinguishing charac-
teristic.
Direct translation is characteristic of a system (e.g.,
GAT) designed from the start to translate out of one
specific language and into another. Direct systems are

limited to the minimum work necessary to effect that
translation; for example, disambiguation is performed
only to the extent necessary for translation into that one
target language, irrespective of what might be required
for another language. Indirect translation, on the other
hand, is characteristic of a system (e.g., EUROTRA)
wherein the analysis of the source language and the
synthesis of the target language are totally independent
processes; for example, disambiguation is performed to
the extent necessary to determine the &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot;
(however represented) of the source language input, irre-
spective of which target language(s) that input might be
,translated into.
The interlingua approach is characteristic of a system
(e.g., CETA) in which the representation of the
&amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; of the source language input is intended to be
independent of any language, and this same represen-
tation is used to synthesize the target language output.
The linguistic universals searched for and debated about
by linguists and philosophers is the notion that underlies
an interlingua. Thus, the representation of a given unit of
meaning would be the same, no matter what language (or
grammatical structure) that unit might be expressed in.
The transfer approach is characteristic of a system (e.g.,
TAUM) in which the underlying representation of the
&amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; of a grammatical unit (e.g., sentence) differs
depending on the language from which it was derived or
into which it is to be generated; this implies the existence
of a third translation stage which maps one language-spe-
cific meaning representation into another: this stage is
called Transfer. Thus, the overall transfer translation
process is Analysis followed by Transfer and then
Synthesis. The transfer versus interlingua difference is
not applicable to all systems; in particular, direct MT
systems use neither the transfer nor the interlingua
approach, since they do not attempt to represent
&amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot;.
Local scope versus global scope is not so much a differ-
ence of category as degree. Local scope characterizes a
system (e.g., SYSTRAN) in which words are the essential
unit driving analysis, and in which that analysis is, in
effect, performed by separate procedures for each word
which try to determine — based on the words to the left
and/or right — the part of speech, possible idiomatic
usage, and &amp;quot;sense&amp;quot; of the word keying the procedure. In
such systems, for example, homographs (words that
differ in part of speech and/or derivational history [thus
meaning], but that are written alike) are a major prob-
lem, because a unified analysis of the sentence per se is
not attempted. Global scope characterizes a system
(e.g., METAL) in which the meaning of a word is deter-
mined by its context within a unified analysis of the
sentence (or, rarely, paragraph). In such systems, by
contrast, homographs do not typically constitute a signif-
icant problem because the amount of context taken into
account is much greater than is the case with systems of
local scope.

There are several comprehensive treatments of MT
projects (Bruderer 1977) and MT history (Hutchins
1978) available in the open literature. To illustrate some
continuity in the field of MT, while remaining within
reasonable space limits, our brief historical overview is
restricted to defunct systems or projects that gave rise to
follow-on systems or projects of current interest. These

GAT: GEORGETOWN AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998356275">
Georgetown University was the site of one of the earliest
MT projects. Begun in 1952, and supported by the U.S.
government, Georgetown&apos;s GAT system became opera-
tional in 1964 with its delivery to the Atomic Energy
Commission at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and to
Europe&apos;s corresponding research facility EURATOM in
Ispra, Italy. Both systems were used for many years to
translate Russian physics texts into &amp;quot;English&amp;quot;. The
output quality was quite poor, by comparison with human
translations, but for the intended purpose of quickly
scanning documents to determine their content and inter-
est, the GAT system was nevertheless superior to the only
alternatives: slow and more expensive human translation
or, worse, no translation at all. GAT was not replaced at
EURATOM until 1976; at ORNL, it seems to have been
used until at least 1979 (Jordan et al. 1976, 1977) and
possibly later.
The GAT strategy was direct and local: simple word-
for-word replacement, followed by a limited amount of
transposition of words to result in something vaguely
resembling English. Very soon, a &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; came to be
defined as a single word or a sequence of words forming
an &amp;quot;idiom&amp;quot;. There was no true linguistic theory underly-
ing the GAT design; and, given the state of the art in
computer science, there was no underlying computational
theory either. GAT was developed by being made to
work for a given text, then being modified to account for
the next text, and so on. The eventual result was a
monolithic system of intractable complexity: after its
delivery to ORNL and EURATOM, it underwent no
significant modification. The fact that it was used for so
long is nothing short of remarkable — a lesson in what
can be tolerated by users who desperately need trans-
lation services for which there is no viable alternative to
even low-quality MT.
The Georgetown MT project was terminated in the
mid-60s. Peter Toma, one of the GAT workers, incorpo-
rated LATSEC and developed the SYSTRAN system,
which in 1970 replaced the IBM Mark II system at the

In 1961 a project to translate Russian into French was
started at Grenoble University in France. Unlike GAT,
Grenoble began the CETA project with a clear linguistic
theory — having had a number of years in which to
witness and learn from the events transpiring at George-
town and elsewhere. In particular, it was resolved to
achieve a dependency-structure analysis of every
sentence (a global approach) rather than rely on intra-
sentential heuristics to control limited word transposition
(the local approach); with a unified analysis in hand, a
reasonable synthesis effort could be mounted. The
theoretical basis of CETA was interlingua (implying a
language-independent, neutral meaning representation)
at the grammatical level, but transfer (implying a
mapping from one language-specific meaning represen-
tation to another) at the lexical [dictionary] level. The
state of the art in computer science still being primitive,
Grenoble was essentially forced to adopt IBM assembly
language as the software basis of CETA (Hutchins 1978).
The CETA system was under development for ten
years; during 1967-71 it was used to translate 400,000
words of Russian mathematics and physics texts into
French. The major findings of this period were that the
use of an interlingua erases all clues about how to express
the translation; also, that it results in extremely poor or
no translations of sentences for which complete analyses
cannot be derived. The CETA workers learned that it is
critically important in an operational system to retain
surface clues about how to formulate the translation
(Indo-European languages, for example, have many
structural similarities, not to mention cognates, that one
can take advantage of), and to have &amp;quot;fail-soft&amp;quot; measures
designed into the system. An interlingua does not allow
this easily, if at all, but the transfer approach does.
A change in hardware (thus software) in 1971
prompted the abandonment of the CETA system, imme-
diately followed by the creation of a new project/system
called GETA, based entirely on a fail-soft transfer design.
The software included significant amounts of assembly
language; this continued reliance on assembly language
was soon to have deleterious effects, for reasons now
obvious to anyone. We return to our discussion of GETA
below.

<bodyText confidence="0.999963272727273">
Having had the same opportunity for hindsight, the
University of Texas in 1961 used U.S. government fund-
ing to establish the Linguistics Research Center, and with
it the METAL project, to investigate MT — not from
Russian but from German into English. (MT research at
the University actually began in 1956.) The LRC
adopted Chomsky&apos;s transformational paradigm, which
was quickly gaining popularity in linguistics circles, and
within that framework employed a syntactic interlingua
based on deep structures. It was soon discovered that
transformational linguistics per se was not sufficiently
well developed to support an operational system, and
certain compromises were made. The eventual result, in
1974, was an 80,000-line, 14-overlay FORTRAN
program running on a dedicated CDC 6600. Indirect
translation was performed in 14 steps of global analysis,
transfer, and synthesis — one for each of the 14 overlays
— and required prodigious amounts of CPU time and I/O
from/to massive data files. U.S. government support for
MT projects was winding down in any case, and the
METAL project was shortly terminated.
Several years later, a small Government grant resur-
rected the project. The FORTRAN program was rewrit-
ten in LISP to run on a DEC-10; in the process, it was
pared down to just three major stages (analysis, transfer,
and synthesis) comprising about 4,000 lines of code
which could be accommodated in three overlays, and its
computer resource requirements were reduced by a
factor of ten. Though U.S. government interest once
again languished, the Sprachendienst (Language
Services) department of Siemens AG in Munich had
begun supporting the project, and in 1980 Siemens AG
became the sole sponsor.

In 1965 the University of Montreal established the
TAUM project with Canadian government funding. This
was probably the first MT project designed strictly
around the transfer approach. As the software basis of
the project, TAUM chose the FORTRAN programming
language on the CDC 6600 (later, the CYBER 173). After
an initial period of more-or-less open-ended research, the
Canadian government began adopting specific goals for
the TAUM system. A chance remark by a bored transla-
tor in the Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC) had
led to a spin-off project: TAUM-METEO. Weather fore-
casters already adhered to a relatively consistent style
and vocabulary in their English reports. Partly as a result
of this, translation into French was so monotonous a task
that human translator turnover in the weather service
was extraordinarily high — six months was the average
tenure. TAUM was commissioned in 1975 to produce an
operational English-French MT system for weather fore-
casts. A prototype was demonstrated in 1976, and by
1977 METE° was installed for production translation.
METEO is discussed in the next major section.
The next challenge was not long in coming: by a fixed
date, TAUM had to be usable for the translation of a 90
million word set of aviation maintenance manuals from
English into French (else the translation had to be started
by human means, since the result was needed quickly).

From this point on, TAUM concentrated on the aviation
manuals exclusively. To alleviate problems with their
predominantly syntactic analysis (especially considering
the many multiple-noun compounds present in the
aviation manuals), the group began in 1977 to incorpo-
rate significant semantic analysis in the
TAUM-AVIATION system.
After a test in 1979, it became obvious that
TAUM-AVIATION was not going to be production-ready
in time for its intended use. The Canadian government
organized a series of tests and evaluations to assess the
status of the system. Among other things, it was discov-
ered that the cost of writing each dictionary entry was
remarkably high (3.75 man-hours, costing $35-40 Cana-
dian), and that the system&apos;s runtime translation cost was
also high (6 cents per word) considering the cost of
human translation (8 cents per word), especially when
the post-editing costs (10 cents per word for TAUM
versus 4 cents per word for human translations) were
taken into account (Gervais 1980). TAUM-AVIATION
was not yet cost-effective. Several other factors, espe-
cially the bad Canadian economic situation, combined
with this to cause the cancellation of the TAUM project
in 1981. There are recent signs of renewed interest in
MT in Canada. State-of-the-art surveys have been
commissioned (Pierre Isabelle, formerly of TAUM,
personal communication), but no successor project has
yet been established.

ALP: AUTOMATED LANGUAGE PROCESSING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992224137931">
In 1971 a project was established at Brigham Young
University to translate Mormon ecclesiastical texts from
English into multiple languages — starting with French,
German, Portuguese and Spanish. The original aim was
to produce a fully-automatic MT system based on Junc-
tion Grammar (Lytle et al. 1975), but in 1973 the
emphasis shifted to Machine-aided Translation (MAT,
where the system does not attempt to analyze sentences
on its own, according to pre-programmed linguistic rules,
but instead relies heavily on interaction with a human to
effect the analysis if one is even attempted and complete
the translation). This Interactive Translation System
(ITS) performed global analysis of sentences (with human
assistance), and then indirect transfer (again, with human
assistance).
The BYU project never produced an operational
system (hardware costs and the amount and difficulty of
human interaction prohibited cost-effectiveness), and the
Mormon Church, through the University, began to
dismantle the project. In 1980, a group of BYU program-
mers joined Weidner Communications Corporation, and
helped develop the fully-automatic, direct Weidner MT
system. At about the same time, most of the remaining
BYU project members left to form Automated Language
Processing Systems (ALPS) and continue development of
ITS. Both of these systems are actively marketed today,
and are discussed in the next section. Some work contin-
ues at BYU, but at a very much reduced level and degree
of aspiration (e.g., Melby 1982).

CURRENT PRODUCTION SYSTEMS

In this section we consider the major M(A)T systems
being used and/or marketed today. Some of these origi-
nate from the &amp;quot;failures&amp;quot; described above, but other
systems are essentially the result of successful (i.e.,
continuing) MT R&amp;D projects. The full MT systems
discussed below are the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999544">
• SYSTRAN,
• LOGOS,
• METEO,
• Weidner, and
• SPANAM.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997375">
We also discuss the MAT systems CULT and ALPS. Most
of these systems have been installed for several custom-
ers (METEO, SPANAM, and CULT are the exceptions,
with only one obvious customer each). The oldest active
installation dates from 1970.
A &amp;quot;standard installation&amp;quot;, if it can be said to exist,
includes provision for pre-processing in some cases,
translation (with much human intervention in the case of
MAT systems), and some amount of post-editing. To MT
system users, acceptability is a function of the amount of
pre- and/or post-editing that must be done (which is also
the greatest determinant of cost). Van Slype (1982)
reports that &amp;quot;acceptability to the human translator . . .
appears negotiable when the quality of the MT system is
such that the correction (i.e., post-editing) ratio is lower
than 20% (1 correction every 5 words) and when the
human translator can be associated with the upgrading of
the MT system.&amp;quot; It is worth noting that editing time has
been observed to fall with practice: Pigott (1982) reports
that &amp;quot; . . . the more M.T. output a translator handles, the
more proficient he becomes in making the best use of this
new tool. In some cases he manages to double his output
within a few months as he begins to recognize typical
M.T. errors and devise more efficient ways of correcting
them.&amp;quot;
It is also important to realize that, though none of
these systems produces output mistakable for human
translation [at least not good human translation], their
users have found sufficient reason to continue using
them. Some users, indeed, are repeat customers. In
short, MT and MAT systems cannot be argued not to
work, for they are in fact being bought and used, and
they save time and/or money for their users. Every user
expresses a desire for improved quality and reduced cost,
to be sure, but then the same is said about human trans-
lation. Thus, in the only valid sense of the idiom, MT and
MAT have already &amp;quot;arrived&amp;quot;. Future improvements in
quality, and reductions in cost — both certain to take
place — will serve to make M(A)T systems even more
attractive.

SYSTRAN
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954724137931">
SYSTRAN was one of the first MT systems to be market-
ed; the first installation replaced the IBM Mark II
Russian-English system at the USAF FTD in 1970, and is
still operational. NASA selected SYSTRAN in 1974 to
translate materials relating to the Apollo-Soyuz collab-
oration, and EURATOM replaced GAT with SYSTRAN in
1976. Also by 1976, FTD was augmenting SYSTRAN
with word-processing equipment to increase productivity
(e.g., to eliminate the use of punched cards). The system
has continued to evolve, for example by the shift toward
a more modular design and by the allowance of topical
glossaries (essentially, dictionaries specific to the subject
area of the text). The system has been argued to be ad
hoc — particularly in the assignment of semantic features
(Pigott 1979). The USAF FTD dictionaries number over
a million entries; Bostad (1982) reports that dictionary
updating must be severely constrained, lest a change to
one entry disrupt the activities of many others. (A study
by Wilks (1978) reported an improvement/degradation
ratio [after dictionary updates] of 7:3, but Bostad implies
a much more stable situation after the introduction of
stringent quality-control measures.)
In 1976 the Commission of the European Communi-
ties purchased an English-French version of SYSTRAN
for evaluation and potential use. Unlike the FTD, NASA,
and EURATOM installations, where the goal was infor-
mation acquisition, the intended use by CEC was for
information dissemination — meaning that the output was
to be carefully edited before human consumption. Van
Slype (1982) reports that &amp;quot;the English-French standard
vocabulary delivered by Prof. Toma to the Commission
was found to be almost entirely useless for the Commis-
sion environment.&amp;quot; Early evaluations were negative
(e.g., Van Slype 1979), but the existing and projected
overload on CEC human translators was such that inves-
tigation continued in the hope that dictionary additions
would improve the system to the point of usability.
Additional versions of SYSTRAN were purchased
(French-English in 1978, and English-Italian in 1979).
The dream of acceptable quality for post-editing
purposes was eventually realized: Pigott (1982) reports
that &amp;quot; . . . the enthusiasm demonstrated by [a few trans-
lators] seems to mark something of a turning point in
[machine translation].&amp;quot; Currently, about 20 CEC trans-
lators in Luxembourg are using SYSTRAN on a Siemens
7740 computer for routine translation; one factor
accounting for success is that the English and French
dictionaries now consist of well over 100,000 entries in
the very few technical areas for which SYSTRAN is being
employed.
Also in 1976, General Motors of Canada acquired
SYSTRAN for translation of various manuals (for vehicle
service, diesel locomotives, and highway transit coaches)
from English into French on an IBM mainframe. GM&apos;s
English-French dictionary had been expanded to over
130,000 terms by 1981 (Sereda 1982). Subseque ly,
GM purchased an English-Spanish version of SYSTRAN,
and began to build the necessary [very large] dictionary.
Sereda (1982) reports a speed-up of 3-4 times in the
productivity of his human translators (from about 1000
words per day); he also reveals that developing
SYSTRAN dictionary entries costs the company approxi-
mately $4 per term (word- or idiom-pair).
While other SYSTRAN users have applied the system
to unrestricted texts (in selected subject areas), Xerox
has developed a restricted input language (Multinational
Customized English) after consultation with LATSEC.
That is, Xerox requires its English technical writers to
adhere to a specialized vocabulary and a strict manual of
style. SYSTRAN is then employed to translate the result-
ing documents into French, Italian, Spanish, German,
and Portuguese. Ruffino (1982) reports &amp;quot;a five-to-one
gain in translation time for most texts&amp;quot; with the range of
gains being 2-10 times. This approach is not necessarily
feasible for all organizations, but Xerox is willing to
employ it and claims it also enhances source-text clarity.
Currently, SYSTRAN is being used in the CEC for the
routine translation, followed by human post-editing, of
around 1,000 pages of text per month in the couples
English-French, French-English, and English-Italian
(Wheeler 1983). Given this relative success in the CEC
environment, the Commission has recently ordered an
English-German version as well as a French-German
version. Judging by past experience, it will be quite some
time before these are ready for production use, but when
ready they will probably save the CEC translation bureau
valuable time, if not real money as well.

LOGOS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885541666667">
Development of the LOGOS system was begun in 1964.
The first installation, in 1971, was used by the U.S. Air
Force to translate English maintenance manuals for mili-
tary equipment into Vietnamese. Due to the termination
of U.S. involvement in that war, its use was ended after
two years. (A report by Sinaiko and Klare (1973)
disparaged LOGOS&apos;s cost-effectiveness, but this claim
was argued to be seriously flawed and was formally
protested (Scott, personal communication).) The linguis-
tic foundations of LOGOS are not well advertised,
presumably for reasons involving trade secrecy. The
system developer states that &amp;quot;our linguistic approach . . .
has evolved in ways analogous to case grammar/valency
theory . . . mapping natural language into a semanto-
syntactic abstraction language organized as a tree&amp;quot;
(Scott, personal communication).
LOGOS continued to attract customers. In 1978,
Siemens AG began funding the development of a LOGOS
German-English system for telecommunications manuals.
After three years LOGOS delivered a &amp;quot;production&amp;quot;
system, but it was not found suitable for use (due in part
to poor quality of the translations, and in part to the
economic situation within Siemens which had resulted in
a much-reduced demand for translation, hence no imme-

diate need for an MT system). Eventually LOGOS forged
an agreement with the Wang computer company that
allowed the implementation of the German-English
system (formerly restricted to large IBM mainframes) on
Wang office computers. This system reached the
commercial market, and has been purchased by several
multi-national organizations (e.g., Nixdorf, Triumph-
Adler, Hewlett-Packard); development of other language
pairs (e.g., English-French, English-German) is under-
way (Scott, personal communication).

METEO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952063829787">
TAUM-METEO is the world&apos;s only example of a truly
fully-automatic MT system. Developed as a spin-off of
the TAUM technology, as discussed earlier, it was fully
integrated into the Canadian Meteorological Center&apos;s
(CMC&apos;s) nation-wide weather communications network
by 1977. METE() scans the network traffic for English
weather reports, translates them &amp;quot;directly&amp;quot; into French,
and sends the translations back out over the communi-
cations network automatically. Rather than relying on
post-editors to discover and correct errors, METEO
detects its own errors and passes the offending input to
human editors; output deemed &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; by METE() is
dispatched without human intervention, or even over-
view.
TAUM-METEO was probably also the first MT system
where translators were involved in all phases of the
design/development/refinement; indeed, a CMC transla-
tor instigated the entire project. Since the restrictions on
input to METE() were already in place before the project
started (i.e., METE() imposed no new restrictions on
weather forecasters), METE() cannot quite be classed
with the Xerox SYSTRAN system, which relies on
restrictions geared to the characteristics of SYSTRAN.
But METEO is not extensible — though similar systems
could be built for equally restricted textual domains, if
they exist.
One of the more remarkable side effects of the
METE() installation is that the translator turnover rate
within the CMC went from 6 months, prior to METEO, to
several years, once the CMC translators began to trust
METEO&apos;s operational decisions and not review its output
(Brian Harris, personal communication). METEO&apos;s input
constitutes over 24,000 words per day, or 8.5 million
words per year. Of this, it now correctly translates
90-95%, shuttling the other (&amp;quot;more interesting&amp;quot;) 5-10%
to the human CMC translators. Almost all of these
&amp;quot;analysis failures&amp;quot; are attributable to communications
noise (the CMC network garbles some traffic),
misspellings (METEO does not attempt corrections), or
words missing from the dictionary, though some failures
are due to the inability of the system to handle certain
linguistic constructions. METEO&apos;s computational require-
ments total about 15 CPU minutes per day on a CDC
7600 (Thouin 1982). By 1981, it appeared that the built-
in limitations of METEO&apos;s theoretical basis had been
reached, and further improvement was not likely to be
cost-effective.

WEIDNER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994094339623">
Weidner was established in 1977 by Bruce Weidner, who
soon hired some MT programmers from the fading BYU
project. Weidner delivered a production English-French
system to Mitel in Canada in 1980, and a beta-test Engl-
ish-Spanish system to the Siemens Corporation (USA) in
the same year. In 1981 Mitel took delivery on Weidner&apos;s
English-Spanish and English-German systems, and Bray-
ice (a translation service bureau in Japan) purchased the
Weidner English-Spanish and Spanish-English systems.
To date, there are 22 or more installations of the Weid-
ner MT system around the world. The Weidner system,
though &amp;quot;fully automatic&amp;quot; during translation, is marketed
as a &amp;quot;machine aid&amp;quot; to translation (perhaps to avoid the
stigma usually attached to MT). It is highly interactive
for other purposes (the lexical pre-analysis of texts, the
construction of dictionaries, etc.), and integrates word-
processing software with external devices (e.g., the
Xerox 9700 laser printer at Mitel) for enhanced overall
document production. Thus, the Weidner system accepts
a formatted source document (actually, one containing
formatting or typesetting codes) and produces a format-
ted translation. This is an important feature to users,
since almost everyone is interested in producing format-
ted translations from formatted source texts.
Given the way this system is tightly integrated with
modern word-processing technology, it is difficult to
assess the degree to which the translation component
itself enhances translator productivity, versus the degree
to which simple automation of formerly manual (or poor-
ly automated) processes accounts for the productivity
gains. The direct translation component itself is not
particularly sophisticated. For example, analysis is local,
usually confined to the noun phrase or verb phrase level
(except for Japanese) — so that context available only at
higher levels cannot be taken into account.
Translation is performed in four independent stages:
homograph disambiguation, idiom search, structural anal-
ysis, and transfer. These stages do not interact with each
other, which creates more problems; for example, homo-
graphs are resolved once and for all very early on, with-
out any higher-level context (it is not available until
later) that would make this process much more sensitive.
As another example, Hundt (1982) comments that
&amp;quot;idioms are an extremely important part of the trans-
lation procedure. . . . machine assisted translation is for
the most part word replacement . . . .&amp;quot; Then, &amp;quot;It is not
worthwhile discussing the various problems of the [Weid-
ner] system in great depth because in the first place they
are much too numerous . . . .&amp;quot; Yet even though the
Weidner translations are of low quality, users neverthe-
less report economic satisfaction with the results. Hundt
continues, &amp;quot; . . . [T]he Weidner system indeed works as
an aid . . . &amp;quot; and, &amp;quot;800 words an hour as a final figure

[for translation throughput] is not unrealistic.&amp;quot; This level
of performance was not attainable with previous [human]
methods, and some users report the use of Weidner to be
cost-effective, as well as faster, in their environments.
In 1982, Weidner delivered English-German and
German-English systems to ITT in Great Britain; but
there were some financial problems (a third of the
employees were laid off that year) until 1983, when a
controlling interest was purchased by a Japanese compa-
ny: Bravice, one of Weidner&apos;s customers, owned by a
group of Japanese investors. Weidner continues to
market MT systems, and is presently working to develop
Japanese MT systems. A commercial Japanese-English
system has recently been announced by Bravice, and
work continues on an English-Japanese system. In addi-
tion, Weidner has implemented its system on the IBM
Personal Computer, in order to reduce its dependence on
the PDP-11 in particular, and on any one machine in
general. The system is written in FORTRAN, with some
assembly code support, but there are plans to reimple-
ment the software in another language to increase its
flexibility.

SPANAM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955819672131">
Following a promising feasibility study, the Pan Ameri-
can Health Organization in Washington, D.C. decided in
1975 to undertake work on a machine translation system,
utilizing some of the same techniques developed for GAT.
Consultants were hired from nearby Georgetown Univer-
sity, the home of GAT. The official PAHO languages are
English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish; Spanish-Engl-
ish was chosen as the initial language pair, due to the
belief that &amp;quot;This combination requires fewer parsing stra-
tegies in order to produce manageable output [and other
reasons relating to expending effort on software rather
than linguistic rules]&amp;quot; (Vasconcellos 1983). Actual work
started in 1976, and the first prototype was running in
1979, using punched card input on an IBM mainframe.
With the subsequent integration of a word-processing
system, production use could be seriously considered.
After further upgrading, an in-house translation
service based on SPANAM was created in 1980. Later
that year, in its first major test, SPANAM reduced
manpower requirements for a test translation effort by
45%, resulting in a monetary savings of 61% (Vascon-
cellos 1983). (Because these SPANAM translation and
on-line post-editing figures appear to be contrasted
against the purely manual, hardcopy translation tradition
at PAHO, the gains from using SPANAM per se may be
hopelessly confounded with the gains of working on-line;
thus, it is difficult or impossible to say how much increase
in productivity is accounted for by SPANAM alone.)
Since 1980, SPANAM has been used to translate well
over a million words of text, averaging about 4,000
words per day per post-editor. The post-editors have
amassed &amp;quot;a bag of tricks&amp;quot; for speeding the revision work,
and special string functions have also been built into the
word processor for handling SPANAM&apos;s English output.
Concerning the early status of SPANAM, sketchy
details implied that the linguistic technology underlying it
was essentially that of GAT; the grammar rules seemed to
be built into the programs, in the GAT tradition. The
software technology was updated in that the programs
are modular. The system is not sophisticated: it adopts
the direct translation strategy, and settles for local analy-
sis of phrases and some clauses via a sequence of primi-
tive, independent processing stages (e.g., homograph
resolution) — again, in the Georgetown tradition.
SPANAM is currently used by three PAHO translators in
their routine work.
A follow-on project to develop ENGSPAN (for Engl-
ish-Spanish), underway since 1981, has also delivered a
production system — this one characterized by a more
advanced design (e.g., an ATN parser), some features of
which may find their way into SPANAM. (SPANAM is
currently &amp;quot;undergoing a major overhaul&amp;quot; (Vasconcellos,
personal communication).) Four PAHO translators
already employ ENGSPAN in their daily work. Based on
the successes of these two systems, development of
ENGPORT (with Portuguese as the Target Language) has
begun. In the future, &amp;quot;all translators [in the Language
Services bureau of PAHO will be] expected to use MT at
least part of the time, and the corresponding duties are
included in the post descriptions&amp;quot; • (Vasconcellos,
personal communication).

CULT: CHINESE UNIVERSITY LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99977392">
CULT is possibly the most successful of the Machine-aid-
ed Translation systems, Development began at the
Chinese University of Hong Kong around 1968. CULT
translates Chinese mathematics and physics journals
(published in Beijing) into English through a highly-inter-
active process [or, at least, with a lot of human inter-
vention]. The goal was to eliminate post-editing of the
results by allowing a large amount of pre-editing of the
input, and a certain [unknown] degree of human inter-
vention during translation. Although published details
(Loh 1976, 1978, 1979) are not unambiguous, it is clear
that humans intervene by marking sentence and phrase
boundaries in the input, and by indicating word senses
where necessary, among other things. (What is not clear
is whether this is strictly a pre-editing task, or an interac-
tive task.) CULT runs on the ICL 1904A computer.
Beginning in 1975, the CULT system was applied to
the task of translating the Acta Mathematica Sinica into
English; in 1976, this was joined by the Acta Physica
Sinica. Originally the Chinese character transcription
problem was solved by use of the standard telegraph
codes invented a century ago, and the input data was
punched on cards. But in 1978 the system was updated
by the addition of word-processing equipment for on-line
data entry and pre- or post-editing.

It is not clear how general the techniques behind
CULT are — whether, for example, it could be applied to
the translation of other texts — nor how cost-effective it
is in operation. Other factors may justify its continued
use. It is also unclear whether R&amp;D is continuing, or
whether CULT, like METEO, is unsuited to design modifi-
cation beyond a certain point already reached. In the
absence of answers to these questions, and perhaps
despite them, CULT does appear to be an MAT success
story: the amount of post-editing said to be required is
trivial — limited to the re-introduction of certain untrans-
latable formulas, figures, etc., into the translated output.
At some point, other translator intervention is required,
but it seems to be limited to the manual inflection of
verbs and nouns for tense and number, and perhaps the
introduction of a few function words such as determiners.

ALPS: AUTOMATED LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950891891892">
ALPS was incorporated by a group of five Brigham
Young University ITS developers in 1980; this group
seems to have been composed of linguists interested in
producing machine aids for human translators (dictionary
look-up and substitution, etc.) and later grew to include
virtually all of the major figures from the ITS staff
(Melby and Tenney, personal communication). Thus the
new ALPS system is interactive in all respects, and does
not seriously pretend to perform translation; rather,
ALPS provides the translator with a set of software tools
to automate many of the tasks encountered in everyday
translation experience. ALPS adopted the language pairs
that the BYU ITS system had supported: English into
French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. Since then,
other languages (e.g., Arabic) have been announced, but
their commercial status is unclear. In addition to selling
MAT systems, ALPS now includes its own translation
service bureau.
The new ALPS system is intended to work on any of
three &amp;quot;levels&amp;quot; — providing capabilities from multilingual
word processing and dictionary lookup, through word-
for-word (actually, term-for-term) translation, to highly-
automated (though human-assisted) sentence-level
translation; &apos;the latter mode of operation, judging by
ALPS demonstrations and the reports of users, is seldom
if ever employed. The central tool provided by ALPS is
thus a menu-driven word-processing system coupled to
the on-line dictionary. One of the first ALPS customers
seems to have been Agnew TechTran — a commercial
translation bureau which acquired the ALPS system for
in-house use. Other customers include Xerox, Compu-
terVision, Control Data (in France), IBM (in Italy) and
Hewlett-Packard (in Mexico). Recently, another shake-
up at Weidner Communication Corporation (the Provo
R&amp;D group was disbanded) has allowed ALPS to hire a
large group of former Weidner workers: ALPS might
itself be intending to enter the fully-automatic MT arena.

In addition to the organizations marketing or using exist-
ing M(A)T systems, there are several groups engaged in
on-going R&amp;D in this area. Operational (i.e., marketed or
used) systems have not yet resulted from these efforts,
but deliveries are foreseen at various times in the future.
We discuss the major Japanese MT efforts briefly (as if
they were unified, in a sense, though for the most part
they are actually separate), and then the major U.S. and
European MT systems at greater length.
MT R &amp; D IN JAPAN
In 1982 Japan electrified the technological world by
widely publicizing its new Fifth Generation project and
establishing the Institute for New Generation Computer
Technology (ICOT) as its base. Its goal is to leapfrog
Western technology and place Japan at the forefront of
the digital electronics world in the 1990&apos;s. MITI (Japan&apos;s
Ministry of International Trade and Industry) is the moti-
vating force behind this project, and intends that the goal
be achieved through the development and application of
highly innovative techniques in both computer architec-
ture and Artificial Intelligence.
Of the application areas considered as an applications
candidate by the ICOT scientists and engineers, Machine
Translation played a prominent role (Moto-oka 1982).
Among the western Artificial Intelligentsia, the inclusion
of MT seems out of place: AI researchers have been
trying (successfully) to ignore all MT work in the two
decades since the ALPAC debacle, and almost universally
believe that success is impossible in the foreseeable
future — in ignorance of the successful, cost-effective
applications already in place. To the Japanese leader-
ship, however, the inclusion of MT is no accident.
Foreign language training aside, translation into Japanese
is still one of the primary means by which Japanese
researchers acquire information about what their West-
ern competitors are doing, and how they are doing it.
Translation out of Japanese is necessary before Japan
can export products to its foreign markets, because the
customers demand that the manuals and other documen-
tation not be written only in Japanese, and in general
translation is seen as a way to &amp;quot;diffuse the Japanese
scientific and technological information to outer world&amp;quot;
(Nagao, personal communication). The Japanese
correctly view translation as necessary to their technolog-
ical survival, but have found it extremely difficult — and
expensive — to accomplish by human means: the trans-
lation budgets of Japanese companies, when totalled, are
estimated to exceed 1 trillion yen, and most of this
involves the export trade (Philippi 1985). Accordingly,
the Japanese government and industry have sponsored
MT research for several decades. There has been no rift
between Al and MT researchers in Japan, as there has
been in the West — especially in the U.S.

Nomura (1982) numbers the MT R&amp;D groups in Japan
at more than 18. (By contrast, there might be a dozen
significant MT groups in all of the U.S. and Europe,
including commercial vendors.) Several of the Japanese
projects are quite large. (By contrast, only one MT
project in the western world (EUROTRA) even appears
as large, but most of the 80 individuals involved work on
EUROTRA only a fraction of their time.) Most of the
Japanese projects are engaged in research as much as
development. (Most Western projects are engaged in
pure development.) Japanese progress in MT has not
come fast: until a few years ago, their hardware technol-
ogy was inferior; so was their software competence, but
this situation has been changing rapidly. Another obsta-
cle has been the great differences between Japanese and
Western languages — especially English, which is of
greatest interest to them — and the relative paucity of
knowledge about these differences. The Japanese are
working to eliminate this ignorance: progress has been
made, and production-quality systems already exist for
some applications. None of the Japanese MT systems are
direct, and all engage in global analysis; most are based
on a transfer approach, but a few groups are pursuing the
interlingua approach.
MT research has been pursued at Kyoto University
since 1964. There were once two MT projects at Kyoto
(one for long-term research, one for near-term applica-
tion). The former project, recently abandoned, was
working on an English-Japanese translation system based
on formal semantics (Cresswell&apos;s simplified version of
Montague Grammar (Nishida et al. 1982, 1983)). The
latter has developed a practical system for translating
English titles of scientific and technical papers into Japa-
nese (Nagao 1980, 1982), and is working on other appli-
cations of English-Japanese (Tsujii 1982) as well as
Japanese-English (Nagao 1981). This effort, funded by
the Agency of Science and Technology and headed by
Prof. Nagao, &amp;quot;consists of more than 20 people [at
Kyoto], with three other organizations involved [compris-
ing another 20 workers]&amp;quot; (Nagao personal communi-
cation). The goal of this four-year, $2.7 million (U.S.)
project is to create a practical system for translating tech-
nical and scientific documents from Japanese into
English and vice versa (Philippi 1985). Kyushu Universi-
ty has been the home of MT research since 1955, with
projects by Tamachi and Shudo (1974). The University
of Osaka Prefecture and Fukuoka University also host
MT projects.
However, most Japanese MT research (like other
research) is performed in the industrial laboratories.
Fujitsu (Sawai et al. 1982), Hitachi, Toshiba (Amano
1982), and NEC (Muraki &amp; Ichiyama 1982), among
others, support large projects generally concentrating on
the translation of computer manuals. Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone is working on a system to translate scien-
tific and technical articles from Japanese into English and
vice versa (Nomura et al. 1982), and is looking into the
future as far as simultaneous machine translation of tele-
phone conversations (Nomura, personal communication).
Recently a joint venture by Hitachi and Quick has
resulted in a English-Japanese system which will be used
to offer Japanese readers news from Europe and the U.S.
on the economy, stock market, and commodities; eventu-
ally, this service will be offered via Quick&apos;s on-line
market information service (AAT 1984). In addition,
Fujitsu has announced its bi-directional Atlas Japanese-
English system for translating technical texts; this system
is now available for lease (AAT 1984). NEC and IBM
Japan have also recently announced development of
systems intended for near-term commercial introduction
(Philippi 1985).
Japanese industrialists are not confining their attention
to work at home. Several Al groups in the U.S. (e.g., SRI
International) have been approached by Japanese
companies desiring to fund MT R&amp;D projects, and the
Linguistics Research Center of the University of Texas is
currently engaged in MT-related research funded by
Hitachi. More than that, some U.S. MT vendors
(SYSTRAN and Weidner, at least) have recently sold
partial interests to Japanese investors, and delivered
production MT systems. Various Japanese corporations
(e.g., NTT and Hitachi) and trade groups (e.g., JEIDA
(Japan Electronic Industry Development Association))
have sent teams to visit MT projects around the world
and assess the state of the art. University researchers
have been given sabbaticals to work at Western MT
centers (Prof. Shudo at Texas, Prof. Tsujii at Grenoble).
Other representatives have indicated Japan&apos;s desire to
establish close working communications with the CEC&apos;s
EUROTRA project (King and Nagao, personal communi-
cation). Japan evidences a long-term, growing commit-
ment to acquire and develop MT technology. The
Japanese leadership is convinced that success in MT is
vital to their future.

METAL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841611111111">
One of the major MT R&amp;D groups around the world, the
METAL project at the Linguistics Research Center of the
University of Texas, has recently delivered a commer-
cial-grade system. The METAL German-English system
passed tests in a production-style setting in late 1982,
mid-1983, and twice in 1984, and the system was then
installed at the sponsor&apos;s site in Germany for further test-
ing and final development of a translator interface.
Renamed LITRAS, it was introduced for sale at the
Hanover Fair in Germany in April 1985. The METAL
dictionaries are now being expanded for maximum possi-
ble coverage of selected technical areas, and work on
other language pairs has begun in earnest.
One of the particular strengths of the METAL system
is its accommodation of a variety of linguistic
theories/strategies. The German analysis component is
based on a context-free phrase-structure grammar,
augmented by procedures with facilities for, among other

things, arbitrary transformations. The English analysis
component, on the other hand, employs a modified GPSd
approach and makes no use of transformations. Analysis
is completely separated from transfer, and the system is
multilingual in that a given constituent structure analysis
can be used for transfer and synthesis into multiple target
languages. (Translation from German into Chinese and
Spanish, as well as from English into German, has tran-
spired on an experimental basis.)
The transfer component of METAL includes two
transformation packages, one used by transfer grammar
rules and the other by transfer dictionary entries; these
cooperate during transfer, which is effected during a
top-down exploration of the (highest-scoring) tree
produced in the analysis phase. The strategy for the
top-down pass is controlled by the linguist who writes the
transfer rules. These are most often paired 1-1 with the
grammar rules used to perform the original analysis, so
that there is no need to search through a general transfer
grammar to find applicable rules (potentially allowing
application of the wrong ones); however, the option of
employing a more general transfer grammar is available,
and is in fact used for the translation of clauses. As
implied above, structural and lexical transfer are
performed in the same pass, so that each may influence
the operation of the other; in particular, transfer diction-
ary entries may specify the syntactic and/or semantic
contexts in which they are valid. If no analysis is
achieved for a given input, the longest phrases which
together span that input are selected for independent
transfer and synthesis, so that every input (a sentence, or
perhaps a phrase) results in some translation.
In addition to producing a translation system per se,
the Texas group has developed software packages for
text processing (so as to format the output translations
like the original input documents), data base manage-
ment (of dictionary entries and grammar rules), rule vali-
dation (to eliminate most errors in dictionary entries and
grammar rules), dictionary construction (to enhance
human efficiency in coding lexical entries), etc. Aside
from the word-processing front-end (developed by the
project sponsor), the METAL group has developed a
complete system, rather than a basic machine translation
engine that leaves much drudgery for its human
developers/users. Lehmann et al. (1981), Bennett
(1982), and Slocum (1983, 1984, 1985) present more
details about the METAL system.

GETA
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989446153846">
As discussed earlier, the Groupe d&apos;Etudes pour la
Traduction Automatique was formed when Grenoble
abandoned the CETA system. In reaction to the failures
of the interlingua approach, GETA adopted the transfer
approach. In addition, the former software design was
largely discarded, and a new software package supporting
a new style of processing was substituted. The core of
the GETA translation system (ARIANE-78) is composed
of three types of programs: one converts strings into
trees (for, e.g., word analysis), one converts trees into
trees (for, e.g., syntactic analysis and transfer), and the
third converts trees into strings (for, e.g., word synthe-
sis). (A fourth type exists, but may be viewed as a
specialized instance of one of the others.) The overall
translation process is composed of a sequence of stages,
wherein each stage employs one of these programs.
Other modules in ARIANE-78 support editing and system
maintenance functions.
One of the features of ARIANE-78 that sets it apart
from other MT systems is the insistence on the part of the
designers that no stage be more powerful than is mini-
mally necessary for its proper function. Thus, rather
than supplying the linguist with programming tools capa-
ble of performing any operation whatever (e.g., the arbi-
trarily powerful 0-systems of TAUM), ARIANE-78
supplies at each stage only the minimum capability neces-
sary to effect the desired linguistic operation, and no
more. This reduces the likelihood that the linguist will
become overly ambitious and create unnecessary prob-
lems, and also enabled the programmers to produce soft-
ware that runs more rapidly than would be possible with
a more general scheme.
A &amp;quot;grammar&amp;quot; in the ROBRA subsystem is actually a
network of subgrammars; that is, a grammar is a graph
specifying alternative sequences of applications of the
subgrammars and optional choices of which subgrammars
are to be applied (at all). The top-level grammar is
therefore a &amp;quot;control graph&amp;quot; over the subgrammars that
actually effect the linguistic operations — analysis, trans-
fer, etc. ARIANE-78 is sufficiently general to allow
implementation of any linguistic theory, or even multiple
theories at once (in separate subgrammars) if such is
desired. Thus, in principle, it is completely open-ended
and could accommodate arbitrary semantic processing
and reference to &amp;quot;world models&amp;quot; of any description.
In practice, however, the story is more complicated.
In order to increase the computational flexibility, as is
required to take advantage of substantially new linguistic
theories, especially &amp;quot;world models&amp;quot;, the underlying soft-
ware would have to be changed in many various ways.
Unfortunately, the underlying software is rigid (written in
low-level languages), making modification extremely
difficult. As a result, the GETA group has been unable to
experiment with any radically new computational strate-
gies. Back-up, for example, is a known problem (Tsujii,
personal communication): if the GETA system &amp;quot;pursues a
wrong path&amp;quot; through the control graph of subgrammars,
it can undo some of its work by backing up past whole
graphs, discarding the results produced by entire
subgrammars; but within a subgrammar, there is no
possibility of backing up and reversing the effects of indi-
vidual rule applications. Until GETA receives enough
funding that programmers can be hired to rewrite the
software in a high-level language (LISP/PROLOG is being
evaluated), facilitating present and future redesign, the

GETA group is &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; with the current software — now
showing clear signs of age, to say nothing of non-trans-
portability (to other than IBM machines).
GETA seems not to have been required to produce a
full-fledged application early on, and the staff was rela-
tively free to pursue research interests. Unless the GETA
software basis can be updated, however, it may not long
remain a viable system. (The GETA staff are actively
seeking funding for such a project.) Meanwhile, the
French government has launched a major application
effort — Projet Nationale — to commercialize the GETA
system, in which the implementation language is LISP
(Peccoud, personal communication).

SUSY: SAARBRUCKER CBERSETZUNGSSYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999671390243903">
The University of the Saar at Saarbrticken, West Germa-
ny, hosts one of the larger MT projects in Europe, estab-
lished in the late 1960s. After the failure of a project
intended to modify GAT for Russian-German trans-
lation, a new system was designed along somewhat simi-
lar lines to translate Russian into German after &amp;quot;global&amp;quot;
sentence analysis into dependency tree structures, using
the transfer approach. Unlike most other MT projects,
the Saarbriicken group was left relatively free to pursue
research interests, rather than forced to produce applica-
tions, and was also funded at a level sufficient to permit
significant on-going experimentation and modification.
As a result, SUSY tended to track external developments
in MT and AI more closely ,than other projects. For
example, Saarbrticken helped establish the co-operative
MT group LEIBNIZ (along with Grenoble and others) in
1974. Until 1975, SUSY was based on a strict transfer
approach; since 1976, however, it has evolved, becoming
more abstract as linguistic problems mandating &amp;quot;deeper&amp;quot;
analysis have forced the transfer representations to
assume some of the generality of an interlingua. Also as
a result of such research freedom, there was apparently
no sustained attempt to develop coverage for specific
end-user applications.
Developed as a multilingual system involving English,
French, German, Russian, and Esperanto, work on SUSY
has tended to concentrate on translation into German
from Russian and, recently, English. The strongest limit-
ing factor in the further development of SUSY seems to
be related to the initial inspiration behind the project:
SUSY adopted a primitive approach in which the linguis-
tic rules were organized into strictly independent strata
and, where efficiency seemed to dictate, incorporated
directly into the software (Maas 1984). As a conse-
quence, the rules were virtually unreadable, and their
interactions, eventually, became almost impossible to
manage. In terms of application potential, therefore,
SUSY seems to have failed, even though it is used (within
University projects) for the translation of patent
descriptions and other materials. A second-generation
project, SUSY-II, begun in 1981, may fare better.

EUROTRA
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989696129629629">
EUROTRA is the largest MT project in the Western
world. It is the first serious attempt to produce a true
multilingual system, in this case intended for all seven
European Economic Community languages. The justi-
fication for the project is simple, inescapable economics:
over a third of the entire administrative budget of the
EEC for 1982 was needed to pay the translation division
(average individual cost: $43,000 per year), which still
could not keep up with the demands placed on it; techni-
cal translation costs the EEC $0.20 per word for each of
six translations (from the seventh original language), and
doubles the cost of the technology documented; with the
addition of Spain and Portugal, the translation staff
would have to double for the current demand level
(unless highly productive machine aids were already in
place) (Perusse 1983). The high cost of writing
SYSTRAN dictionary entries is presently justifiable for
reasons of speed in translation, but this situation is not
viable in the long term. The EEC must have superior
quality MT at lower cost for dictionary work. Human
translation alone will never suffice.
EUROTRA is a true multi-national development
project. There is no central laboratory where the work
will take place, but instead designated University repre-
sentatives of each member country will produce the anal-
ysis and synthesis modules for their native language; only
the transfer modules will be built by a &amp;quot;central&amp;quot; group —
and the transfer modules are designed to be as small as
possible, consisting of little more than lexical substitution
(King 1982). Software development will be almost
entirely separated from the linguistic rule development;
indeed, the production software, though designed by the
EUROTRA members, will be written by whichever
commercial software house wins the contract in bidding
competition. Several co-ordinating committees are work-
ing with the various language and emphasis groups to
ensure co-operation.
The theoretical linguistic basis of EUROTRA is not
novel. The basic structures for representing &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot;
are dependency trees, marked with feature-value pairs
partly at the discretion of the language groups writing the
grammars (anything a group wants, it can add), and part-
ly controlled by mutual agreement among the language
groups (a certain set of feature-value combinations has
been agreed to constitute minimum information; all are
constrained to produce this set when analyzing sentences
in their language, and all may expect it to be present
when synthesizing sentences in their language) (King
1981, 1982). This is not to say that no new linguistic
knowledge is being gained for, aside from the test of
theory that EUROTRA is about to perform, there is the
very substantial matter of the background contrastive
linguistic investigation that has been going on since about
1978.

In one sense, the software basis of EUROTRA will not
be novel either. The basic rule interpreter will be &amp;quot;a
general re-write system with a control language over
grammars/processes&amp;quot; (King, personal communication).
As with ARIANE-78, the linguistic rules can be bundled
into packets of subgrammars, and the linguists will be
provided with a means of controlling which packets of
rules are applied, and when; the individual rules will be
non-destructive re-write rules, so that the application of
any given rule may create new structure, but will never
erase any old information.
In another sense, however, the software basis of
EUROTRA is quite remarkably different from other
systems that have preceded it. The analysis, transfer, and
synthesis strategies will not be incorporated into algo-
rithms that the programmers implement; rather, they will
be formulated by linguists and represented in a special
control language (not the rule-writing language, which is
algorithm-independent). This formulation of the dynam-
ic control strategies will be compiled into a program that
will then interpret the &amp;quot;static&amp;quot; rules describing the
linguistic facts.
This is a bold step. There are, of course, pitfalls to
any such action. Aside from the usual risk of unforeseen
problems, there are two rather obvious unresolved issues.
First, it remains to be seen whether linguists, trained
mostly in the static, &amp;quot;descriptive&amp;quot; framework of linguis-
tics (modern or otherwise), can accommodate themselves
to the expression of dynamic algorithms — a mode of
thinking that programmers (including almost all computa-
tional linguists) are far more adept at. Second, it also
remains to be seen whether the system can be designed
sufficiently flexibly to adjust to the wide range of exper-
imental strategies that is sure to come when the staff is
given such a large degree of freedom (remembering that
the software implementation is seen as an essentially
one-shot process to be performed on contract basis),
while at the same time retaining sufficient speed to
ensure that the computing requirements are affordable.
Affordability is not merely an issue belonging to the
eventual production system! On the contrary, it is crit-
ically important that a development group be able to
conduct experiments that produce results in a reasonable
amount of time. After too long a delay, the difference
becomes one of category rather than degree, and
progress is substantially — perhaps fatally — impeded.
The EUROTRA charter requires delivery of a small
representative prototype system by late 1987, and a
prototype covering one technical area by late 1988. The
system must translate among the official languages of all
member countries that sign a &amp;quot;contract of association&amp;quot;;
thus, not all seven EEC languages will necessarily be
represented, but by law at least four languages must be
represented if the project is to continue. It appears that
the requisite number of member states have committed to
join. It will be interesting to see whether this, the most
ambitious of all MT projects, succeeds; either way, the
consequences promise to be noteworthy.

THE STATE OF THE ART
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978065217392">
Human languages are, by nature, different. So much so
that the illusory goal of abstract perfection in translation
— once and still imagined by some to be achievable — can
be comfortably ruled out of the realm of possible exist-
ence, whether attempted by machine or man. Even the
abstract notion of &amp;quot;quality&amp;quot; is undefinable, hence immea-
surable. In its place, we must substitute the notion of
evaluation of translation according to its purpose, judged
by the consumer. One must therefore accept the truth
that the notion of quality is inherently subjective.
Certainly there will be translations hailed by most if not
all as &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;, and correspondingly there will be trans-
lations almost universally labelled &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot;. Most trans-
lations, however, will surely fall in between these
extremes, and each user must render his own judgement
according to his needs.
In corporate circles, however, there is and has always
been an operational definition of &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; versus &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot;
translation: a good translation is what senior translators
are willing to expose to outside scrutiny (not that they
are fully satisfied, for they never are); and a bad one is
what they are not willing to release. These experienced
translators — usually post-editors — impose a judgement
the corporate body is willing to accept at face value: after
all, such judgement is the very purpose for having senior
translators. It is arrived at subjectively, based on the
purpose for which the translation is intended, but comes
as close to being an objective assessment as the world is
likely to see. In a post-editing context, a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; original
translation is one worth revising — i.e., one the editor will
endeavor to change, rather than reject or replace with his
own original translation.
Therefore, any rational position on the state of the art
in MT and MAT must respect the operational decisions
about the quality of MT and MAT as judged by the pres-
ent users. These systems are all, of course, based on old
technology (&amp;quot;ancient&amp;quot;, by the standards of Al research-
ers); but by the time systems employing today&apos;s AI tech-
nology hit the market, they too will be &amp;quot;antiquated&amp;quot; by
the research laboratory standards of their time. Such is
the nature of technology. We therefore distinguish, in
our assessment, between what is available and/or used
now (&amp;quot;old&amp;quot;, yet operationally current, technology), and
what is around the next corner (techniques working in
research labs today), and what is farther down the road
(experimental approaches).

this hard to discern), and none go beyond that to the
paragraph level. None use a significant amount of
semantic information (though all claim to use some).
Most if not all perform as &amp;quot;idiots savants&amp;quot;, making use of
enormous amounts of very unsophisticated pragmatic
information and brute-force computation to determine
the proper word-for-word or idiom-for-idiom translation
followed by local rearrangement of word order — leaving
the translation chaotic, even if understandable.
But they work! Some of them do, anyway — well
enough that their customers find reason to invest enor-
mous amounts of time and capital developing the neces-
sary massive dictionaries specialized to their applications.
Translation time is certainly reduced. Translator frus-
tration is increased or decreased, as the case may be (it
seems that personality differences, among other things,
have a large bearing on this). Some translators resist
their introduction — there are those who still resist the
introduction of typewriters, to say nothing of word
processors — with varying degrees of success. But most
are thinking about accepting the place of computers in
translation, and a few actually look forward to relief from
much of the drudgery they now face. Current MT
systems seem to take some getting used to, and further
productivity increases are realized as time goes by; they
are usually accepted, eventually, as a boon to the bored
translator. New products embodying old technology are
constantly introduced; most are found not viable, and
quickly disappear from the market. But those that have
been around for years must be economically justifiable to
their users — else, presumably, they would no longer
exist.

DEVELOPMENT SYSTEMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952239130435">
Systems being developed for near-term introduction
employ Computational Linguistics (CL) techniques of the
late 1970s, if not the 1980s. Essentially all are full MT,
not MAT, systems. As Hutchins (1982) notes, &amp;quot; . . .
there is now considerable agreement on the basic strate-
gy, i.e. a transfer system with some semantic analysis and
some interlingual features in order to simplify transfer
components.&amp;quot; These systems employ one of a variety of
sophisticated parsing/transducing techniques, typically
based on charts, whether the grammar is expressed via
phrase-structure rules (e.g., METAL) or (strings of) trees
(e.g., GETA, EUROTRA); they operate at the sentence
level, or higher, and make significant use of semantic
features. Proper linguistic theories, whether elegant or
not quite, and heuristic software strategies take the place
of simple word substitution and brute-force program-
ming. If the analysis attempt succeeds, the translation
stands a fair chance of being acceptable to the revisor; if
analysis fails, then fail-soft measures are likely to
produce something equivalent to the output of a current
production MT system.
These systems work well enough in experimental
settings to give their sponsors and waiting customers (to
say nothing of their implementers) reason to hope for
near-term success in application. Their technology is
based on some of the latest techniques that appear to be
workable in immediate large-scale application. Most
&amp;quot;pure AI&amp;quot; techniques do not fall in this category; thus,
serious Al researchers look down on these development
systems (to say nothing of production systems) as old,
uninteresting — and probably useless. Some likely are.
But others, though &amp;quot;old&amp;quot;, will soon find an application
niche, and will begin displacing any of the current
production systems that try to compete. (Since the pres-
ent crop of development systems all seem to be aimed at
the &amp;quot;information dissemination&amp;quot; application, the current
production systems aimed at the &amp;quot;information
acquisition&amp;quot; market may survive for some time.) The
major hurdle is time: time to write and debug the gram-
mars (a very hard task), and time to develop lexicons

the few tens of thousands of technical terms required per

cial applications (e.g., GETA) or have just recently done

RESEARCH SYSTEMS

The biggest problem associated with MT research
systems is their scarcity (nonexistence, in ,the U.S.). If
current CL and Al researchers were seriously interested
in foreign languages — even if not for translation per se —
this would not necessarily be a bad situation. But in the
U.S. very few are so interested, and in Europe CL and AI
research has not yet reached the level achieved in the
U.S. Western business and industry are more concerned
with near-term payoff, and some track development
systems; very few support MT development directly, and
none yet support pure MT research at a significant level.
(The Dutch firm Philips may, indeed, have the only long-
term research project in the West.) Some European
governments fund significant R&amp;D projects (e.g., Germa-
ny and France), but Japan is making by far the world&apos;s
largest investment in MT research. The U.S. government,
which otherwise supports the best overall Al and
(English) CL research in the world, is not involved.
Where pure MT research projects do exist, they tend
to concentrate on the problems of deep meaning repre-
sentations — striving to pursue the goal of a true Al
system, which would presumably include language-inde-
pendent meaning representations of great depth and
complexity. Translation here is seen as just one applica-
tion or such a system: the system &amp;quot;understands&amp;quot; natural
language input, then &amp;quot;generates&amp;quot; natural language
output; if the languages happen to be different, then
translation has been performed via paraphrase. Trans-
lation could thus be viewed as one of the ultimate tests of
an Artificial Intelligence: if a system &amp;quot;translates
correctly&amp;quot;, then to some extent it can be argued to have
&amp;quot;understood correctly&amp;quot;, and in any case will tell us much

about what translation is all about. In this role, MT
research holds out its greatest promise as a once-again
scientifically respectable discipline. The first require-
ment, however, is the existence of research groups inter-
ested in, and funded for, the study of multiple languages
and .translation among them within the framework of Al
research. At the present time only Japan, and to a some-
what lesser extent western Europe, can boast such
groups.

FUTURE PROSPECTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996071428571">
The world has changed in the two decades since ALPAC.
The need and demand for technical translation has
increased dramatically, and the supply of qualified human
technical translators has not kept pace. (Indeed, it is
debatable whether there existed a sufficient supply of
qualified technical translators even in 1966, contrary to
ALPAC&apos;s claims.) The classic &amp;quot;law of supply and
demand&amp;quot; has not worked in this instance, for whatever
reasons: the shortage is real, all over the world; nothing
is yet serving to stem this worsening situation; and noth-
ing seems capable of doing so outside of dramatic
productivity increases via computer automation. In the
EEC, for example, the already overwhelming need for
technical translation is projected to rise sixfold within
five years.
The future promises greater acceptance by translators
of the role of machine aids — running the gamut from
word processing systems and on-line term banks to MT
systems — in technical translation. Correspondingly,
M(A)T systems will experience greater success in the
marketplace. As these systems continue to drive down
the cost of translation, the demand and capacity for
translation will grow even more than it would otherwise:
many &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; needs for translation, not presently
economically justifiable, will surface. If MT systems are
to continue to improve so as to further reduce the burden
on human translators, there will be a greater need and
demand for continuing MT R&amp;D efforts.

CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980232142857">
The translation problem will not go away, and human
solutions (short of full automation) do not now, and
never will, suffice. MT systems have already scored
successes among the user community, and the trend can
hardly fail to continue as users demand further improve-
ments and greater speed, and MT system vendors
respond. The half-million pages of text translated by
machine in 1984 is but a drop in the bucket of translation
demand. Of course, the need for research is great, but
some current and future applications will continue to
succeed on economic grounds alone — and to the user
community, this is virtually the only measure of success
or failure.
It is important to note that translation systems are not
going to &amp;quot;fall out&amp;quot; of Al efforts not seriously contending
with multiple languages from the start. There are two
reasons for this. First, English is not a representative
language. Relatively speaking, it is not even a very hard
language from the standpoint of Computational Linguis-
tics: Japanese, Chinese, Russian, and even German, for
example, seem more difficult to deal with using existing
CL techniques — surely in part due to the nearly total
concentration of CL workers on English, and their conse-
quent development of tools specifically for English (and,
accidentally, for English-like languages). Developing
translation ability will require similar concentration by
CL workers on other languages; nothing less will suffice.
Second, it would seem that translation is not by any
means a simple matter of understanding the source text,
then reproducing it in the target language — even though
many translators (and virtually every layman) will say
this is so. On the one hand, there is the serious question
of whether, in for example the case of an article on front-
line research in semiconductor switching theory, or parti-
cle physics, a translator really does &amp;quot;fully comprehend&amp;quot;
the content of the article he is translating. One would
suspect not. (Johnson (1983) makes a point of claiming
that he has produced translations, judged good by
informed peers, in technical areas where his expertise is
deficient, and his understanding, incomplete.) On the
other hand, it is also true that translation schools expend
considerable effort teaching techniques for low-level lexi-
cal and syntactic manipulation — a curious fact to
contrast with the usual &amp;quot;full comprehension&amp;quot; claim. In
any event, every qualified translator will agree that there
is much more to translation than simple
analysis/synthesis (an almost prime facie proof of the
necessity for Transfer).
What this means is that the development of translation
as an application of Computational Linguistics will
require substantial research in its own right in addition to
the work necessary in order to provide the basic multilin-
gual analysis and synthesis tools. Translators must be
consulted, for they are the experts in translation. None
of this will happen by accident; it must result from
design.

In the multi-national firm Siemens, even internal communications that are translated are post-edited. Such news generally comes as a surprise, if not a shock, to most people in the U.S. It is easy to see, therefore, that the &amp;quot;fully-automatic high-quality machine translation&amp;quot; standard, imagined by most U.S. scholars to constitute minimum acceptability, must be radically redefined. Indeed, the most famous MT critic of all eventually recanted his strong opposition to MT, admitting that these terms could only be defined by the users, according to their own standards, for each situation (Bar-Hillel 1971). So an MT system does not have to print and bind the result of its translation in order to qualify as &amp;quot;fully automatic&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;High quality&amp;quot; does not at all rule out post-editing, since the proscription of human revision would &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; the infeasibility of high-quality Human Translation. Academic debates about what constitutes &amp;quot;high-quality&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fully-automatic&amp;quot; are considered irrelevant by the users of Machine Translation (MT) and Machine-aided Translation (MAT) systems; what matters to them are two things: whether the systems can produce output of sufficient quality for the intended use (e.g., r</context>

Also by 1976, FTD was augmenting SYSTRAN with word-processing equipment to increase productivity (e.g., to eliminate the use of punched cards). The system has continued to evolve, for example by the shift toward a more modular design and by the allowance of topical glossaries (essentially, dictionaries specific to the subject area of the text). The system has been argued to be ad hoc — particularly in the assignment of semantic features (Pigott 1979). The USAF FTD dictionaries number over a million entries; Bostad (1982) reports that dictionary updating must be severely constrained, lest a change to one entry disrupt the activities of many others. (A study by Wilks (1978) reported an improvement/degradation ratio [after dictionary updates] of 7:3, but Bostad implies a much more stable situation after the introduction of stringent quality-control measures.) In 1976 the Commission of the European Communities purchased an English-French version of SYSTRAN for evaluation and potential use.

The theoretical basis of CETA was interlingua (implying a language-independent, neutral meaning representation) at the grammatical level, but transfer (implying a mapping from one language-specific meaning representation to another) at the lexical [dictionary] level. The state of the art in computer science still being primitive, Grenoble was essentially forced to adopt IBM assembly language as the software basis of CETA (Hutchins 1978). The CETA system was under development for ten years; during 1967-71 it was used to translate 400,000 words of Russian mathematics and physics texts into French. The major findings of this period were that the use of an interlingua erases all clues about how to express the translation; also, that it results in extremely poor or no translations of sentences for which complete analyses cannot be derived. The CETA workers learned that it is critically important in an operational system to retain surface clues about how to formulate the translation (Indo-European languages, for example, have many</context>

Second, it would seem that translation is not by any means a simple matter of understanding the source text, then reproducing it in the target language — even though many translators (and virtually every layman) will say this is so. On the one hand, there is the serious question of whether, in for example the case of an article on frontline research in semiconductor switching theory, or particle physics, a translator really does &amp;quot;fully comprehend&amp;quot; the content of the article he is translating. One would suspect not. (Johnson (1983) makes a point of claiming that he has produced translations, judged good by informed peers, in technical areas where his expertise is deficient, and his understanding, incomplete.) On the other hand, it is also true that translation schools expend considerable effort teaching techniques for low-level lexical and syntactic manipulation — a curious fact to contrast with the usual &amp;quot;full comprehension&amp;quot; claim. In any event, every qualified translator will agree that there is much more to translation than simple analysis/synthesis (an almost prime facie proof of the necessity for Transfer).

Both systems were used for many years to translate Russian physics texts into &amp;quot;English&amp;quot;. The output quality was quite poor, by comparison with human translations, but for the intended purpose of quickly scanning documents to determine their content and interest, the GAT system was nevertheless superior to the only alternatives: slow and more expensive human translation or, worse, no translation at all. GAT was not replaced at EURATOM until 1976; at ORNL, it seems to have been used until at least 1979 (Jordan et al. 1976, 1977) and possibly later. The GAT strategy was direct and local: simple wordfor-word replacement, followed by a limited amount of transposition of words to result in something vaguely resembling English. Very soon, a &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; came to be defined as a single word or a sequence of words forming an &amp;quot;idiom&amp;quot;. There was no true linguistic theory underlying the GAT design; and, given the state of the art in computer science, there was no underlying computational theory either.

CULT: CHINESE UNIVERSITY LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR CULT is possibly the most successful of the Machine-aided Translation systems, Development began at the Chinese University of Hong Kong around 1968. CULT translates Chinese mathematics and physics journals (published in Beijing) into English through a highly-interactive process [or, at least, with a lot of human intervention]. The goal was to eliminate post-editing of the results by allowing a large amount of pre-editing of the input, and a certain [unknown] degree of human intervention during translation. Although published details (Loh 1976, 1978, 1979) are not unambiguous, it is clear that humans intervene by marking sentence and phrase boundaries in the input, and by indicating word senses where necessary, among other things. (What is not clear is whether this is strictly a pre-editing task, or an interactive task.) CULT runs on the ICL 1904A computer. Beginning in 1975, the CULT system was applied to the task of translating the Acta Mathematica Sinica into English; in 1976, this was joined by the Acta Physica Sinica.

The original aim was to produce a fully-automatic MT system based on Junction Grammar (Lytle et al. 1975), but in 1973 the emphasis shifted to Machine-aided Translation (MAT, where the system does not attempt to analyze sentences on its own, according to pre-programmed linguistic rules, but instead relies heavily on interaction with a human to effect the analysis if one is even attempted and complete the translation). This Interactive Translation System (ITS) performed global analysis of sentences (with human assistance), and then indirect transfer (again, with human assistance).

Developed as a multilingual system involving English, French, German, Russian, and Esperanto, work on SUSY has tended to concentrate on translation into German from Russian and, recently, English. The strongest limiting factor in the further development of SUSY seems to be related to the initial inspiration behind the project: SUSY adopted a primitive approach in which the linguistic rules were organized into strictly independent strata and, where efficiency seemed to dictate, incorporated directly into the software (Maas 1984). As a consequence, the rules were virtually unreadable, and their interactions, eventually, became almost impossible to manage. In terms of application potential, therefore, SUSY seems to have failed, even though it is used (within University projects) for the translation of patent descriptions and other materials.

Some of these originate from the &amp;quot;failures&amp;quot; described above, but other systems are essentially the result of successful (i.e., continuing) MT R&amp;D projects. The full MT systems discussed below are the following: • SYSTRAN, • LOGOS, • METEO, • Weidner, and • SPANAM. We also discuss the MAT systems CULT and ALPS. Most of these systems have been installed for several customers (METEO, SPANAM, and CULT are the exceptions, with only one obvious customer each). The oldest active installa</context>

Its goal is to leapfrog Western technology and place Japan at the forefront of the digital electronics world in the 1990&apos;s. MITI (Japan&apos;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry) is the motivating force behind this project, and intends that the goal be achieved through the development and application of highly innovative techniques in both computer architecture and Artificial Intelligence. Of the application areas considered as an applications candidate by the ICOT scientists and engineers, Machine Translation played a prominent role (Moto-oka 1982). Among the western Artificial Intelligentsia, the inclusion of MT seems out of place: AI researchers have been trying (successfully) to ignore all MT work in the two decades since the ALPAC debacle, and almost universally believe that success is impossible in the foreseeable future — in ignorance of the successful, cost-effective applications already in place. To the Japanese leadership, however, the inclusion of MT is no accident. Foreign language training aside, translation into Japanese is still one of the primary means by which Japanese researchers acquire information about what their Wes</context>

The Japanese correctly view translation as necessary to their technological survival, but have found it extremely difficult — and expensive — to accomplish by human means: the translation budgets of Japanese companies, when totalled, are estimated to exceed 1 trillion yen, and most of this involves the export trade (Philippi 1985). Accordingly, the Japanese government and industry have sponsored MT research for several decades.

NASA selected SYSTRAN in 1974 to translate materials relating to the Apollo-Soyuz collaboration, and EURATOM replaced GAT with SYSTRAN in 1976. Also by 1976, FTD was augmenting SYSTRAN with word-processing equipment to increase productivity (e.g., to eliminate the use of punched cards). The system has continued to evolve, for example by the shift toward a more modular design and by the allowance of topical glossaries (essentially, dictionaries specific to the subject area of the text). The system has been argued to be ad hoc — particularly in the assignment of semantic features (Pigott 1979). The USAF FTD dictionaries number over a million entries; Bostad (1982) reports that dictionary updating must be severely constrained, lest a change to one entry disrupt the activities of many others. (A study by Wilks (1978) reported an improvement/degradation ratio [after dictionary updates] of 7:3, but Bostad implies a much more stable situation after the introduction of stringent quality-control measures.) In 1976 the Commission of the European Communities purchased an English-French version of SYSTRAN for evaluation and potential use. Unlike the FTD, NASA, and EURATOM installations, wher</context>

To MT system users, acceptability is a function of the amount of pre- and/or post-editing that must be done (which is also the greatest determinant of cost). Van Slype (1982) reports that &amp;quot;acceptability to the human translator . . . appears negotiable when the quality of the MT system is such that the correction (i.e., post-editing) ratio is lower than 20% (1 correction every 5 words) and when the human translator can be associated with the upgrading of the MT system.&amp;quot; It is worth noting that editing time has been observed to fall with practice: Pigott (1982) reports that &amp;quot; . . . the more M.T. output a translator handles, the more proficient he becomes in making the best use of this new tool. In some cases he manages to double his output within a few months as he begins to recognize typical M.T. errors and devise more efficient ways of correcting them.&amp;quot; It is also important to realize that, though none of these systems produces output mistakable for human translation [at least not good human translation], their users have found sufficient reason to continue using them.

That is, Xerox requires its English technical writers to adhere to a specialized vocabulary and a strict manual of style.

Kyushu University has been the home of MT research since 1955, with projects by Tamachi and Shudo (1974). The University of Osaka Prefecture and Fukuoka University also host MT projects. However, most Japanese MT research (like other research) is performed in the industrial laboratories. Fujitsu (Sawai et al. 1982), Hitachi, Toshiba (Amano 1982), and NEC (Muraki &amp; Ichiyama 1982), among others, support large projects generally concentrating on the translation of computer manuals. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone is working on a system to translate scientific and technical articles from Japanese into English and vice versa (Nomura et al. 1982), and is looking into the future as far as simultaneous m</context>

Judging by past experience, it will be quite some time before these are ready for production use, but when ready they will probably save the CEC translation bureau valuable time, if not real money as well. LOGOS Development of the LOGOS system was begun in 1964. The first installation, in 1971, was used by the U.S. Air Force to translate English maintenance manuals for military equipment into Vietnamese. Due to the termination of U.S. involvement in that war, its use was ended after two years. (A report by Sinaiko and Klare (1973) disparaged LOGOS&apos;s cost-effectiveness, but this claim was argued to be seriously flawed and was formally protested (Scott, personal communication).) The linguistic foundations of LOGOS are not well advertised, presumably for reasons involving trade secrecy. The system developer states that &amp;quot;our linguistic approach . . . has evolved in ways analogous to case grammar/valency theory . . . mapping natural language into a semantosyntactic abstraction language organized as a tree&amp;quot; (Scott, personal communication). LOGOS continued to attract customers. In 1978, Siemens AG began funding the developmen</context>

Lehmann et al. (1981), Bennett (1982), and Slocum (1983, 1984, 1985) present more details about the METAL system. GETA As discussed earlier, the Groupe d&apos;Etudes pour la Traduction Automatique was formed when Grenoble abandoned the CETA system. In reaction to the failures of the interlingua approach, GETA adopted the transfer approach. In addition, the former software design was largely discarded, and a new software package supporting a new style of processing was substituted. The core of the GETA translation system (ARIANE-78) is composed of three types of programs: one converts strings into trees (for, e.g., word analysis), one converts trees int</context>

Of this, it now correctly translates 90-95%, shuttling the other (&amp;quot;more interesting&amp;quot;) 5-10% to the human CMC translators. Almost all of these &amp;quot;analysis failures&amp;quot; are attributable to communications noise (the CMC network garbles some traffic), misspellings (METEO does not attempt corrections), or words missing from the dictionary, though some failures are due to the inability of the system to handle certain linguistic constructions. METEO&apos;s computational requirements total about 15 CPU minutes per day on a CDC 7600 (Thouin 1982). By 1981, it appeared that the builtin limitations of METEO&apos;s theoretical basis had been reached, and further improvement was not likely to be cost-effective. WEIDNER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION Weidner was established in 1977 by Bruce Weidner, who soon hired some MT programmers from the fading BYU project. Weidner delivered a production English-French system to Mitel in Canada in 1980, and a beta-test English-Spanish system to the Siemens Corporation (USA) in the same year.

Consultants were hired from nearby Georgetown University, the home of GAT. The official PAHO languages are English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish; Spanish-English was chosen as the initial language pair, due to the belief that &amp;quot;This combination requires fewer parsing strategies in order to produce manageable output [and other reasons relating to expending effort on software rather than linguistic rules]&amp;quot; (Vasconcellos 1983). Actual work started in 1976, and the first prototype was running in 1979, using punched card input on an IBM mainframe. With the subsequent integration of a word-processing system, production use could be seriously considered. After further upgrading, an in-house translation service based on SPANAM was created in 1980. Later that year, in its first major test, SPANAM reduced manpower requirements for a test translation effort by 45%, resulting in a monetary savings of 61% (Vasconcellos 1983).

Ruffino (1982) reports &amp;quot;a five-to-one gain in translation time for most texts&amp;quot; with the range of gains being 2-10 times. This approach is not necessarily feasible for all organizations, but Xerox is willing to employ it and claims it also enhances source-text clarity. Currently, SYSTRAN is being used in the CEC for the routine translation, followed by human post-editing, of around 1,000 pages of text per month in the couples English-French, French-English, and English-Italian (Wheeler 1983). Given this relative success in the CEC environment, the Commission has recently ordered an English-German version as well as a French-German version. Judging by past experience, it will be quite some time before these are ready for production use, but when ready they will probably save the CEC translation bureau valuable time, if not real money as well.
