This paper presents a word support
model (WSM). The WSM can effec-
tively perform homophone selection
and syllable-word segmentation to im-
prove Chinese input systems. The ex-
perimental results show that: (1) the
WSM is able to achieve tonal (sylla-
bles input with four tones) and tone-
less (syllables input without four tones)
syllable-to-word (STW) accuracies of
99% and 92%, respectively, among the
converted words; and (2) while apply-
ing the WSM as an adaptation proc-
essing, together with the Microsoft
Input Method Editor 2003 (MSIME)
and an optimized bigram model, the
average tonal and toneless STW im-
provements are 37% and 35%, respec-
tively.

According to (Becker, 1985; Huang, 1985; Gu et
al., 1991; Chung, 1993; Kuo, 1995; Fu et al.,
1996; Lee et al., 1997; Hsu et al., 1999; Chen et
al., 2000; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002;
Lee, 2003; Tsai, 2005), the approaches of Chi-
nese input methods (i.e. Chinese input systems)
can be classified into two types: (1) keyboard
based approach: including phonetic and pinyin
based (Chang et al., 1991; Hsu et al., 1993; Hsu,
1994; Hsu et al., 1999; Kuo, 1995; Lua and Gan,
1992), arbitrary codes based (Fan et al., 1988)
and structure scheme based (Huang, 1985); and
(2) non-keyboard based approach: including
optical character recognition (OCR) (Chung,
1993), online handwriting (Lee et al., 1997) and
speech recognition (Fu et al., 1996; Chen et al.,
2000). Currently, the most popular Chinese in-
put system is phonetic and pinyin based ap-
proach, because Chinese people are taught to
write phonetic and pinyin syllables of each Chi-
nese character in primary school.
In Chinese, each Chinese word can be a
mono-syllabic word, such as “R(mouse)”, a bi-
syllabic word, such as “O_R(kangaroo)”, or a
multi-syllabic word, such as “*�ER(Mickey
mouse).” The corresponding phonetic and pin-
yin syllables of each Chinese word is called syl-
lable-words, such as “dai4 shu3” is the pinyin
syllable-word of “O_R(kangaroo).” According
to our computation, the {minimum, maximum,
average} words per each distinct mono-syllable-
word and poly-syllable-word (including bi-
syllable-word and multi-syllable-word) in the
CKIP dictionary (Chinese Knowledge Informa-
tion Processing Group, 1995) are {1, 28, 2.8}
and {1, 7, 1.1}, respectively. The CKIP diction-
ary is one of most commonly-used Chinese dic-
tionaries in the research field of Chinese natural
language processing (NLP). Since the size of
problem space for syllable-to-word (STW) con-
version is much less than that of syllable-to-
character (STC) conversion, the most pinyin-
based Chinese input systems (Hsu, 1994; Hsu et
al., 1999; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002;
Microsoft Research Center in Beijing; Tsai,
2005) are addressed on STW conversion. On the
other hand, STW conversion is the main task of
Chinese Language Processing in typical Chinese
speech recognition systems (Fu et al., 1996; Lee
et al., 1993; Chien et al., 1993; Su et al., 1992).
As per (Chung, 1993; Fong and Chung, 1994;
Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Lee, 2003;
Tsai, 2005), homophone selection and syllable-
word segmentation are two critical problems in
developing a Chinese input system. Incorrect
homophone selection and syllable-word seg-

mentation will directly influence the STW con-
version accuracy. Conventionally, there are two
approaches to resolve the two critical problems:
(1) linguistic approach: based on syntax parsing,
semantic template matching and contextual in-
formation (Hsu, 1994; Fu et al., 1996; Hsu et al.,
1999; Kuo, 1995; Tsai and Hsu, 2002); and (2)
statistical approach: based on the n-gram mod-
els where n is usually 2, i.e. bigram model (Lin
and Tsai, 1987; Gu et al., 1991; Fu et al., 1996;
Ho et al., 1997; Sproat, 1990; Gao et al., 2002;
Lee 2003). From the studies (Hsu 1994; Tsai
and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Kee, 2003; Tsai,
2005), the linguistic approach requires consider-
able effort in designing effective syntax rules,
semantic templates or contextual information,
thus, it is more user-friendly than the statistical
approach on understanding why such a system
makes a mistake. The statistical language model
(SLM) used in the statistical approach requires
less effort and has been widely adopted in com-
mercial Chinese input systems.
In our previous work (Tsai, 2005), a word-
pair (WP) identifier was proposed and shown a
simple and effective way to improve Chinese
input systems by providing tonal and toneless
STW accuracies of 98.5% and 90.7% on the
identified poly-syllabic words, respectively. In
(Tsai, 2005), we have shown that the WP identi-
fier can be used to reduce the over weighting
and corpus sparseness problems of bigram mod-
els and achieve better STW accuracy to improve
Chinese input systems. As per our computation,
poly-syllabic words cover about 70% characters
of Chinese sentences. Since the identified char-
acter ratio of the WP identifier (Tsai, 2005) is
about 55%, there are still about 15% improving
room left.
The objective of this study is to illustrate a
word support model (WSM) that is able to im-
prove our WP-identifier by achieving better
identified character ratio and STW accuracy on
the identified poly-syllabic words with the same
word-pair database. We conduct STW experi-
ments to show the tonal and toneless STW accu-
racies of a commercial input product (Microsoft
Input Method Editor 2003, MSIME), and an
optimized bigram model, BiGram (Tsai, 2005),
can both be improved by our WSM and achieve
better STW improvements than that of these
systems with the WP identifier.
The remainder of this paper is arranged as
follows. In Section 2, we present an auto word-
pair (AUTO-WP) generation used to generate
the WP database. Then, we develop a word sup-
port model with the WP database to perform
STW conversion on identifying words from the
Chinese syllables. In Section 3, we report and
analyze our STW experimental results. Finally,
in Section 4, we give our conclusions and sug-
gest some future research directions.

The system dictionary of our WSM is comprised
of 82,531 Chinese words taken from the CKIP
dictionary and 15,946 unknown words auto-
found in the UDN2001 corpus by a Chinese
Word Auto-Confirmation (CWAC) system (Tsai
et al., 2003). The UDN2001 corpus is a collec-
tion of 4,539624 Chinese sentences extracted
from whole 2001 UDN (United Daily News,
2001) Website in Taiwan (Tsai and Hsu, 2002).
The system dictionary provides the knowledge
of words and their corresponding pinyin sylla-
ble-words. The pinyin syllable-words were
translated by phoneme-to-pinyin mappings, such
as “ㄩˊ”-to-“ju2.”

2.1 Auto-Generation of WP Database
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99907">
Following (Tsai, 2005), the three steps of auto-
generating word-pairs (AUTO-WP) for a given
Chinese sentence are as below: (the details of
AUTO-WP can be found in (Tsai, 2005))
Step 1. Get forward and backward word seg-
mentations: Generate two types of word
segmentations for a given Chinese sen-
tence by forward maximum matching
(FMM) and backward maximum match-
ing (BMM) techniques (Chen et al., 1986;
Tsai et al., 2004) with the system diction-
ary.
Step 2. Get initial WP set: Extract all the com-
binations of word-pairs from the FMM
and the BMM segmentations of Step 1 to
be the initial WP set.
Step 3. Get finial WP set: Select out the word-
pairs comprised of two poly-syllabic
words from the initial WP set into the fin-
ial WP set. For the final WP set, if the
word-pair is not found in the WP data-

2.2 Word Support Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997240882352941">
The four steps of our WSM applied to identify
words for a given Chinese syllables is as follows:
Step 1. Input tonal or toneless syllables.
Step 2. Generate all possible word-pairs com-
prised of two poly-syllabic words for the
input syllables to be the WP set of Step 3.
Step 3. Select out the word-pairs that match a
word-pair in the WP database to be the
WP set. Then, compute the word sup-
port degree (WS degree) for each dis-
tinct word of the WP set. The WS degree
is defined to be the total number of the
word found in the WP set. Finally, ar-
range the words and their corresponding
WS degrees into the WSM set. If the
number of words with the same syllable-
word and WS degree is greater than one,
one of them is randomly selected into the
WSM set.
Step 4. Replace words of the WSM set in de-
scending order of WS degree with the in-
put syllables into a WSM-sentence. If no
words can be identified in the input sylla-
bles, a NULL WSM-sentence is produced.
Table 1 is a step by step example to show the
four steps of applying our WSM on the Chinese
syllables “sui1 ran2 fu3 shi2 jin4 shi4 sui4 yue4
xi1 xu1(雖然俯拾盡是歲月唏噓).” For this
input syllables, we have a WSM-sentence “雖
然俯拾盡是歲月唏噓.” For the same syllables,
outputs of the MSIME, the BiGram and the WP
identifier are “雖然腐蝕進士歲月唏噓,” “雖然
俯拾盡是歲月唏噓” and “雖然 fu3 shi2 近視
sui4 yue4 xi1 xu1.”

we define the STW accuracy, identified charac-

3.1 Background
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985916">
To conduct the STW experiments, firstly, use
the inverse translator of phoneme-to-character
(PTC) provided in GOING system to convert
testing sentences into their corresponding sylla-
bles. All the error PTC translations of GOING
PTC were corrected by post human-editing.
Then, apply our WSM to convert the testing
input syllables back to their WSM-sentences.
Finally, calculate its STW accuracy and ICR by
Equations (1) and (2). Note that all test sen-
tences are composed of a string of Chinese
characters in this study.

the closed test set. The {minimum, maximum,
and mean} of characters per sentence for the
closed test set are {4, 37, and 12}.
(4) Open test set: 10,000 sentences were ran-

open test set. At this point, we checked that
the selected open test sentences were not in
the closed test set as well. The {minimum,

The purpose of this experiment is to demon-
strate the tonal and toneless STW accuracies
among the identified words by using the WSM
with the system WP database. The comparative
system is the WP identifier (Tsai, 2005). Table
2 is the experimental results. The WP database
and system dictionary of the WP identifier is
same with that of the WSM.
From Table 2, it shows the average tonal and
toneless STW accuracies and ICRs of the WSM
are all greater than that of the WP identifier.
These results indicate that the WSM is a better
way than the WP identifier to identify poly-
syllabic words for the Chinese syllables.

We selected Microsoft Input Method Editor
2003 for Traditional Chinese (MSIME) as our
experimental commercial Chinese input system.
In addition, following (Tsai, 2005), an opti-
mized bigram model called BiGram was devel-
oped. The BiGram STW system is a bigram-
based model developing by SRILM (Stolcke,
2002) with Good-Turing back-off smoothing
(Manning and Schuetze, 1999), as well as for-
ward and backward longest syllable-word first
strategies (Chen et al., 1986; Tsai et al., 2004).
The system dictionary of the BiGram is same
with that of the WP identifier and the WSM.
Table 3a compares the results of the MSIME,
the MSIME with the WP identifier and the
MSIME with the WSM on the closed and open
test sentences. Table 3b compares the results of
the BiGram, the BiGram with the WP identifier
and the BiGram with the WSM on the closed
and open test sentences. In this experiment, the
STW output of the MSIME with the WP identi-

We examine the Top 300 STW conversions in
the tonal and toneless from the open testing re-
sults of the BiGram with the WP identifier and
the WSM, respectively. As per our analysis, the
STW errors are caused by three problems, they
are:
(1) Unknown word (UW) problem: For Chinese
NLP systems, unknown word extraction is
one of the most difficult problems and a
critical issue. When an STW error is caused
only by the lack of words in the system dic-
tionary, we call it unknown word problem.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986887666666667">
(2) Inadequate Syllable-Word Segmentation
(ISWS) problem: When an error is caused
by ambiguous syllable-word segmentation
(including overlapping and combination
ambiguities), we call it inadequate syllable-
word segmentation problem.
(3) Homophone selection problem: The remain-
ing STW conversion error is homophone
selection problem.

Table 4 is the analysis results of the three STW
error types. From Table 4, we have three obser-
vations:
(1) The coverage of unknown word problem for
tonal and toneless STW conversions is
similar. In most Chinese input systems, un-
known word extraction is not specifically a
STW problem, therefore, it is usually taken
care of through online and offline manual
editing processing (Hsu et al, 1999). The
results of Table 4 show that the most STW
errors should be caused by ISWS and HS

problems, not UW problem. This observa-
tion is similarly with that of our previous
work (Tsai, 2005).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988427066666667">
(2) The major problem of error conversions in
tonal and toneless STW systems is differ-
ent. This observation is similarly with that
of (Tsai, 2005). From Table 4, the major
improving targets of tonal STW perform-
ance are the HS errors because more than
50% tonal STW errors caused by HS prob-
lem. On the other hand, since the ISWS er-
rors cover more than 50% toneless STW
errors, the major targets of improving tone-
less STW performance are the ISWS errors.
(3) The total number of error characters of the
BiGram with the WSM in tonal and tone-

that of the BiGram with the WP identifier.

This observation should answer the ques-
tion “Why the STW performance of Chi-
nese input systems (MSIME and BiGram)
with the WSM is better than that of these
systems with the WP-identifier?”
To sum up the above three observations and all
the STW experimental results, we conclude that
the WSM is able to achieve better STW im-
provements than that of the WP identifier is be-
cause: (1) the identified character ratio of the
WSM is 15% greater than that of the WP identi-
fier with the same WP database and dictionary,
and meantime (2) the WSM not only can main-
tain the ratio of the three STW error types but
also can reduce the total number of error charac-
ters of converted words than that of the WP
identifier.

4 Conclusions and Future Directions

<bodyText confidence="0.999935487179487">
In this paper, we present a word support model
(WSM) to improve the WP identifier (Tsai,
2005) and support the Chinese Language Proc-
essing on the STW conversion problem. All of
the WP data can be generated fully automati-
cally by applying the AUTO-WP on the given
corpus. We are encouraged by the fact that the
WSM with WP knowledge is able to achieve
state-of-the-art tonal and toneless STW accura-
cies of 99% and 92%, respectively, for the iden-
tified poly-syllabic words. The WSM can be
easily integrated into existing Chinese input
systems by identifying words as a post process-
ing. Our experimental results show that, by ap-
plying the WSM as an adaptation processing
together with the MSIME (a trigram-like model)
and the BiGram (an optimized bigram model),
the average tonal and toneless STW improve-
ments of the two Chinese input systems are
37% and 35%, respectively.
Currently, our WSM with the mixed WP da-
tabase comprised of UDN2001 and AS WP da-
tabase is able to achieve more than 98%
identified character ratios of poly-syllabic
words in tonal and toneless STW conversions
among the UDN2001 and the AS corpus. Al-
though there is room for improvement, we be-
lieve it would not produce a noticeable effect as
far as the STW accuracy of poly-syllabic words
is concerned.
We will continue to improve our WSM to
cover more characters of the UDN2001 and the
AS corpus by those word-pairs comprised of at
least one mono-syllabic word, such as “我們
(we)-是(are)”. In other directions, we will ex-
tend it to other Chinese NLP research topics,
especially word segmentation, main verb identi-
fication and Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) auto-
construction.

Get forward and backward word segmentations: Generate two types of word segmentations for a given Chinese sentence by forward maximum matching (FMM) and backward maximum matching (BMM) techniques (Chen et al., 1986; Tsai et al., 2004) with the system dictionary. Step 2. Get initial WP set: Extract all the combinations of word-pairs from the FMM and the BMM segmentations of Step 1 to be the initial WP set. Step 3. Get finial WP set: Select out the wordpairs comprised of two poly-syllabic words from the initial WP set into the finial WP set.

In addition, following (Tsai, 2005), an optimized bigram model called BiGram was developed. The BiGram STW system is a bigrambased model developing by SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) with Good-Turing back-off smoothing (Manning and Schuetze, 1999), as well as forward and backward longest syllable-word first strategies (Chen et al., 1986; Tsai et al., 2004).

Since the size of problem space for syllable-to-word (STW) conversion is much less than that of syllable-tocharacter (STC) conversion, the most pinyinbased Chinese input systems (Hsu, 1994; Hsu et al., 1999; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Microsoft Research Center in Beijing; Tsai, 2005) are addressed on STW conversion. On the other hand, STW conversion is the main task of Chinese Language Processing in typical Chinese speech recognition systems (Fu et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1993; Chien et al., 1993; Su et al., 1992). As per (Chung, 1993; Fong and Chung, 1994; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Lee, 2003; Tsai, 2005), homophone selection and syllableword segmentation are two critical problems in developing a Chinese input system.

The CKIP dictionary is one of most commonly-used Chinese dictionaries in the research field of Chinese natural language processing (NLP). Since the size of problem space for syllable-to-word (STW) conversion is much less than that of syllable-tocharacter (STC) conversion, the most pinyinbased Chinese input systems (Hsu, 1994; Hsu et al., 1999; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Microsoft Research Center in Beijing; Tsai, 2005) are addressed on STW conversion. On the other hand, STW conversion is the main task of Chinese Language Processing in typical Chinese speech recognition systems (Fu et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1993; Chien et al., 1993; Su et al., 1992). As per (Chung, 1993; Fong and Chung, 1994; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Lee, 2003; Tsai, 2005), homophone selection and syllableword segmentation are two critical problems in developing a Chinese input system.

Conventionally, there are two approaches to resolve the two critical problems: (1) linguistic approach: based on syntax parsing, semantic template matching and contextual information (Hsu, 1994; Fu et al., 1996; Hsu et al., 1999; Kuo, 1995; Tsai and Hsu, 2002); and (2) statistical approach: based on the n-gram models where n is usually 2, i.e. bigram model (Lin and Tsai, 1987; Gu et al., 1991; Fu et al., 1996; Ho et al., 1997; Sproat, 1990; Gao et al., 2002; Lee 2003). From the studies (Hsu 1994; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Kee, 2003; Tsai, 2005), the linguistic approach requires considerable effort in designing effective syntax rules, semantic templates or contextual information, thus, it is more user-friendly than the statistical approach on understanding why such a system makes a mistake. The statistical language model (SLM) used in the statistical approach requires less effort and has been widely adopted in commercial Chinese input systems. In our previous work (Tsai, 2005), a wordpair (WP) identifier was proposed and shown a simple and effective way to improve Chinese input systems by pro</context>

The UDN2001 corpus is a collection of 4,539624 Chinese sentences extracted from whole 2001 UDN (United Daily News, 2001) Website in Taiwan (Tsai and Hsu, 2002).

The pinyin syllable-words were translated by phoneme-to-pinyin mappings, such as “ㄩˊ”-to-“ju2.” 2.1 Auto-Generation of WP Database Following (Tsai, 2005), the three steps of autogenerating word-pairs (AUTO-WP) for a given Chinese sentence are as below: (the details of AUTO-WP can be found in (Tsai, 2005)) Step 1.

(2) Testing corpus: The Academia Sinica Balanced (AS) corpus (Chinese Knowledge Information Processing Group, 1996) was selected as our testing corpus. The AS corpus is one of most famous traditional Chinese corpus used in the Chinese NLP research field (Thomas, 2005). (3) Closed test set: 10,000 sentences were randomly selected from the UDN2001 corpus as the closed test set. The {minimum, maximum, and mean} of characters per sentence for the closed test set are {4, 37, and 12}. (4) Open test set: 10,000 sentences were randomly selected from the AS corpus as the open test set. At this point,</context>

In addition, following (Tsai, 2005), an optimized bigram model called BiGram was developed. The BiGram STW system is a bigrambased model developing by SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) with Good-Turing back-off smoothing (Manning and Schuetze, 1999), as well as forward and backward longest syllable-word first strategies (Chen et al., 1986; Tsai et al., 2004). The system dictionary of the BiGram is same with that of the WP identifier and the WSM. Table 3a compares the results of the MSIME, the MSIME with the WP identifier and the MSIME with the WSM on the closed and open test sentences. Table 3b compares the results of the BiGram, the BiGram with the WP identifier and the BiGram with the WSM on the closed and open test sentences. In this experiment, the STW output of the MSIME with the WP identifier and the WSM, or the BiGram with the WP identifier and the WSM, was collected by directly replacing the identified words of the WP identifier and the W</context>

Since the identified character ratio of the WP identifier (Tsai, 2005) is about 55%, there are still about 15% improving room left.

We conduct STW experiments to show the tonal and toneless STW accuracies of a commercial input product (Microsoft Input Method Editor 2003, MSIME), and an optimized bigram model, BiGram (Tsai, 2005), can both be improved by our WSM and achieve better STW improvements than that of these systems with the WP identifier.

The comparative system is the WP identifier (Tsai, 2005). Table 2 is the experimental results. The WP database and system dictionary of the WP identifier is same with that of the WSM. From Table 2, it shows the average tonal and toneless STW accuracies and ICRs of the WSM are all greater than that of the WP identifier.

From Table 4, we have three observations: (1) The coverage of unknown word problem for tonal and toneless STW conversions is similar. In most Chinese input systems, unknown word extraction is not specifically a STW problem, therefore, it is usually taken care of through online and offline manual editing processing (Hsu et al, 1999). The results of Table 4 show that the most STW errors should be caused by ISWS and HS 846 problems, not UW problem. This observation is similarly with that of our previous work (Tsai, 2005). (2) The major problem of error conversions in tonal and toneless STW systems is different. This observation is similarly with that of (Tsai, 2005). From Table 4, the major improving targets of tonal STW performance are the HS errors because more than 50% tonal STW errors caused by HS problem. On the other hand, since the ISWS errors cover more than 50% toneless STW errors, the major targets of improving toneless STW performance are the ISWS errors. (3) The total number of error characters of the BiGram with the WSM in tonal and toneless STW conversions are both less than that of the BiGram w</context>

All of the WP data can be generated fully automatically by applying the AUTO-WP on the given corpus. We are encouraged by the fact that the WSM with WP knowledge is able to achieve state-of-the-art tonal and toneless STW accuracies of 99% and 92%, respectively, for the identified poly-syllabic words. The WSM can be easily integrated into existing Chinese input systems by identifying words as a post processing. Our experimental results show that, by applying the WSM as an adaptation processing together with the MSIME (a</context>

The training/testing corpus, closed/open test sets and system/user WP database used in the following STW experiments are described as below: ” 844 (1) Training corpus: We used the UDN2001 corpus as our training corpus, which is a collection of 4,539624 Chinese sentences extracted from whole 2001 UDN (United Daily News, 2001) Website in Taiwan (Tsai and Hsu, 2002). (2) Testing corpus: The Academia Sinica Balanced (AS) corpus (Chinese Knowledge Information Processing Group, 1996) was selected as our testing corpus. The AS corpus is one of most famous traditional Chinese corpus used in the Chinese NLP research field (Thomas, 2005). (3) Closed test set: 10,000 sentences were randomly selected from the UDN2001 corpus as the closed test set. The {minimum, maximum, and mean} of characters per sentence for the closed test set are {4, 37, and 12}. (4) Open test set: 10,000 sentences were randomly selected from the AS corp</context>
