In the present paper we argue that
the so—called sentence adverbials
(typically, adverbs like probably,
admittedly,...) should be generated, in
the framework of Functional Generative
Description, by means of a special deep
case — Complementation of Attitude (CA)
on grounds of their special behaviour
in the topic—focus articulation (TFA)
of a sentence. From the viewpoint of the
translation of CA expressions (and also
of the multiple occurrence thereof
inside a sentence) into a calculus of
intensional logic, it should be noted
that the TFA properties of CA expressions
are directly correlated to the scope

is stated in terms of a linguistic

I INTRODUCTION
positions of the occurrence of negation.
AS negation only slightly differs in its
distribution on the surface, there is
raised a proposal according to which
negation (and other minority group
adverbs with similar properties) should
be generated as a case of CA.
CA (including negation and other
minority group adverbs) is defined in FOP
by its position in the underlying basic
ordering of complementations; presumably,
it occupies the leftmost, i.e. the
communicatively least dynamic position.
The TFA properties of CA (also on
its multiple occurrence inside a
sentence) should be taken into account
also in the translation of CA expressions
into a calculus of intensional logic
because they are directly correlated to
the scope properties thereof.
The TFA distinctions which are
reflected on the surface serve as clues
for an algorithm of analysis of CA
expressions in written technical texts
for purposes of a question answering
system without a pre—arranged data base.
In the present paper we argue that
the so—called sentence adverbials
(typically, adverbs like probably,
admittedly,...) as well as certain
minority group adverbs (such as
especially, also, not, even,...)
should be generated, in the framework
of Functional Generative Description
(henceforth, FGD), by means of a new
complementation (functor, deep case),
namely Complementation of Attitude
(henceforth, CA).
We argue that in the underlying
structure of a sentence, CA can occupy
several positions in the topic—focus
articulation (henceforth, TFA) of a
sentence, which coincide with the

A. General Issues
FCD is a multilevel system; it
consists of a sequence of five levels
which are connected by the asymmetrical
relation of form and function, which
acco-mts for the phenomena of homonymy
and synonymy in natural language. The
description of a sentence is equivalent
to a sequence of its representations on
all levels. The difference
between the level of (strict, literal,
linguistic) meaning (i.e. the underlying,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997344">
74
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.993287528455285">
or tectogrammatical level - a level of
disambiguated linguistic expressions) and
the level of surface syntax, being
parallel to the difference which is made
in transformational grammar
between the levels of deep and surface
structure, constitutes the strong
generative power of the FGD system; see
(Sgall et al., 1969), (Haji6ova and
Sgall, 1980), and (Sgall et al.,
forthcoming).
The grammar of FGD consists of the
generative component in the form of a
dependency grammar, which generates
underlying (tectogrammatical)
representations (henceforth, TRs) of
sentences in the form of linear formulas
(which can be rendered also in the share
of rooted and projective dependency
trees), and of the transductive component,
by means of which TRs are translated,
step by step, onto the lower levels of
FGD.
Most important for the
considerations in linguistic theory is
the level of meaning - a link between
the lower levels of the linguistic system
and the (extralinguistic) domain of
cognitive (ontological) content. It
should be emphasized in this place that
the distinctions of the level of meaning
are correlated to those of the domain of
cognitive content only in the translation
of (disambiguated, meaningful) linguistic
expressions into a calculus of
intensional logic, see (Materna and
Sgall, 1980), (Kosik and Sgall, 1981)
and (Materna and 5ga1l, 1983). Thus,
there should be distinguished, on the one
hand, the linguistic semantics, which
deals only with the distinctions which
are structured by the linguistic form,
see (Sgall et al., 1977) and also
de Saussure s and Hjelmslev s conception
of meaning as &amp;quot;form of content&amp;quot;, and on
the other hand, the logical (cognitive)
semantics, which is committed to
(conceptions of) the ontological
structure of reality and which is used
in the interpretation of linguistic
expressions with respect to the
extralinguistic content in their
translation into a logical calculus, e.g.
for purposes of natural language
understanding.
There are two relations defined on
the dependency tree of the TR of a
sentence: the relation of dependency and
the relation of the deep word-order,
which means that a TR captures the
twofold structuring of (the meaning of)
a sentence: its (syntactically based)
dependency structure and its (semantico-
-pragmatically based) communicative
structure, i.e. its TEA.
In the dependency structure of a
sentence the root of the tree represents
the main verb, and the nodes of the main
subtree represent its obligatory,
optional and free complementations. The
dependency principle is recursive. Each
node has labels of three types: lexemic,
morphological (such as -plural,
-future,...) and syntactic (such as
Actor, Locative,...); the syntactic
labels may be alternatively viewed as
labels on the edges of the tree. Every
verb, noun, adjective and adverb has its
case frame, i.e. a specification of its
obligatory and optional complementations,
see (Panevova, 1977).
B. Tonic-Focus Articulation Background
In the communicative structure of
a sentence there is caotured the deer
word-order of the (occurrences of)
complementations, corresponding to a
hierarchy of degrees of communicative
dynamism thereof, as well as the boundary
(boundness juncture) between the topic
and the focus of a sentence, i.e. between
the contextually bound and non-bound
elements of the main subtree of a
sentence. In fact, the above mentioned
communicative distinctions cut across
the dependency structure of a sentence;
thus, every embedded clause as well as
every (complex) phrase has its secondary
TEA, including a secondary boundness
juncture. The notion of contextual
boundness is broadly conceived: not only
a previous mentioning in a text but also
a situational activation may cause he
contextual boundness of an element.&apos;
The degrees of communicative
dynamism of the complementations
17------
On the surface we observe different
means of how the TEA of a sentence is
expressed: cf. the free surface word-
-order in inflectional languages vs.
the various syntactic means in languages
with a fixed (grammatical) surface word-
-order (such as cleft sentences or the
existential construction there is in
English), or the particles ga and wa in
Japanese. A surface representation of a
sentence is often ambiguous between
several possible underlying sources
concerning the different nlacings of the
boundness juncture; these possibilities
may be disclosed by means of the negation
test or the question test, see (Sgall
and Haji6ovA, 1977-78).

occurring in the focus of a sentence
(i.e. also in a topicless sentence) obey
the scale of the underlying basic
ordering of complementations, or
systemic ordering (i.e. ordering of all
types of complementations on their
occurrence in a topicless sentence).
In FGD, universe of discourse is
conceived as the activated part of the
stock of knowledge shared by the speaker
and the hearer during the discourse. The
stock of shared knowledge is supposed to
be dynamic, i.e. changing (being
modified) in time during a discourse. The
most activated elements of the stock of
shared knowledge appear as the
communicatively least dynamic occurrences
of complementations inside a sentence.
The speaker, essentially, is free in the
choice of the topics of sentences.
C. Exemplification
By way of illustration of TRs of
sentences in FGD, let us observe the
surface sentence 1 and one of its TRs
(namely the one where the Actor is
contextually bound) captured by a
(simplified) linear notation and
indicated as TR 1, where act stands for
Actor, att for Attitude, loc for
Location, b is a superscript indicating
contextual boundness, the slash denotes
the boundness juncture of a sentence,
and the brackets correspond in a certain
way to the edges of the dependency tree.

III COMPLEMENTATION OF ATTITUDE
IN THE TOPIC-FOCUS
ARTICULATION OF A SENTENCE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996848034482759">
A. Complementation of Attitude
and Negation
The starting point of our argument
is the claim that CA obeys essentially
the same pattern of occurrence in the
underlying TFA structure of a sentence
as the one which was proposed by
(Haji6ova, 1973) for negation.
In her conception, negation is an
abstract, operator-like functor of FGr
without a label on its edge and without
pertinence to the TFA of a sentence; the
symbol NEG, generated as a label on the
node of the functor of negation, must
be changed by surface rules into such
forms as not, do not, etc.
In spite of the alleged
non-pertinence of negation to the TFA of
a sentence, there are delineated by
Haji6ova exactly three TFA positions
(with respect to the position of the
verb) in which negation can be generated;
out of them, two belong to the primary
case (negation occurring in the focus
of a sentence) and one belongs to the
secondary case (negation occurring in
the topic of a sentence).
In the scheme which follows
we shall see that these three underlying
positions are a perfect match to the
possibilities of occugrence, in the TFA
of a sentence, of CA. In the examples,
the scones of the expressions in question
are indicated by arrows. It should be
noted that in the primary case (i.e. in
(i) and (ii)), the scopes of the
expressions in question extend over the
focus of a sentence.
(i) The verb of a sentence is
non-bound (i.e. it occurs in the focus
of a sentence). There is negated
(&amp;quot;attituded&amp;quot;) the relation between the
topic and the focus of a sentence.
7- In fact, there is even a fourth
possible position of negation and CA in
the TFA of a sentence, which can be
subcategorized as a subcase of (i):
namely, a position where negation and CA
are not only less communicatively
dynamic than the (non-bound) verb, but
where they play the role of the least
communicatively dynamic element of
a sentence (cf. TRs 2 and 3 , also
underlying the ambiguous 2 and 3,
respectively), this leftmost position
coinciding with the position of negation
and CA in the underlying basic ordering
of complementations.

case, negation (or the CA expression)
can stand, on the surface, either in the

ambiguity -../ith case (i) above (cf. the

B. Including Negation into
Complementation of Attitude
On the basis of the observed
coincidence in the behaviour of negation
and CA in the underlying TFA structure
of a sentence, we propose that negation
and CA should be collapsed, i.e. that
negation should be generated as a case of
CA (by means of CA). On this proposal,
there would be removed from FGD the only
abstract label (NEG) and substituted by
the adverb not, which should be viewed as
a regular tectogrammatical lexical unit
occurring in TFs of sentences. Thus,
TRs 2, 4 and 6 should be readjusted to
a shape where instead of NEC, not is
generated as bound or non—bound and as
accompanied by the label of CA (att).

The features in which negation
differs from the rest of CA expressions,
such as (i) its non—occurrence in the
sentence—initial position on the surface
Not, Terry is singing), (ii) its
non—occurrence in the function of a loose
complementation in the sentence—final
position (Terry is singing, not) and
(iii) its regular occurrence in questions
and commands, should be treated as
exceptions which do not have the force
to overthrow the generalization stated
in III C., concerning the behaviour of CA
(including negation) in the underlying
structure of a declarative sentence.
Moreover, as we shall see in III D., not
is not an isolated item among the other
CA expressions because there are also
other minority group adverbs obeying the
same paradigm of occurrence in the TFA
of a sentence which exhibit the essential
idiosyncratic properties of not.

C. Generalizing about Complementation
of Attitude
On grounds of the evidence supplied
in III A., there can be made a
generalization according to which CA
(including negation) occupies, in the
underlying basic ordering of
complementations, the position of the
leftmost, i.e. the least communicatively
dynamic element, which means that it
occurs inside a sentence (in the primary
case, i.e. in (i) and (ii) of III A.)
as the least communicatively dynamic
element of the focus, thus playing on
the surface (with the exception of the
preverbal positions) the role of the
topic-focus boundary indicator (cf.
examples 4 and 5).
Thus, CA is defined, as a
complementation of FGD, by its position
in the underlying basic ordering of
complementations. In fact, every
adverbial expression which obeys the
paradigm of occurrence in the TFA of a
sentence as specified in III A. (the
position in the underlying basic
ordering being only one instance thereof
- cf. Footnote 2) should be classified
as a case of CA, however idiosyncratic
it may seem as concerns its lexical
semantics, its distributional properties,
or its possibilities of paraphrasing.
to the single minority adverb groups
(and even adverbial exoressions belonging
to one group) differ in their lexical
semantics, distributional properties,
and possibilities of paraphrasing.
The groups of CA expressions can be
tentatively subcategorized as follows:
(i) &amp;quot;style disjuncts&amp;quot; (briefly, honestly,
simply,...); (ii) adverbials of
viewpoint (in my view, according to the
newsnapers,...); (iii) &amp;quot;attitudinal
disjuncts&amp;quot; (admittedly, surprisingly,
unfortunately,...); (iv) adverbials of
subjective certainty (probably, possibly,
certainly,...); (v) &amp;quot;particularizers&amp;quot;
especially,...); (vi)
&amp;quot;additives&amp;quot; (also, again,...); (vii)
negation (not77-gnd (viii) &amp;quot;exclusives&amp;quot;
(only,
We suppose that groups (i), (ii)
and (iii) are open-ended (i.e.
productive), whereas the members of
groups (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), and (viii)
can be listed; these groups can be then
labelled as minority adverb Froups. Out
of them, groups (v) - (viii) exhibit the
idiosyncratic properties mentioned above
in III B. and III D.
D. Including other minority adverb
groups into Complementation of
Attitude
We argue that there should be
included into CA also other minority
adverb groups consisting of adverbial
expressions (adverbs) which obey the
paradigm of occurrence in the TFA of a
sentence as specified in III A. and
which share the essential idiosyncratic
properties of not, such as especially,
mainly, also, again, even, and only.
All of them exhibit the properties (ii)
and (iii) (as specified in III B.), and
only exhibits also (i).
We propose, then, that CA should be
viewed as a means of generating
adverbial expressions which exhibit a
special kind of behaviour in the TFA of
a sentence (specified in III A.) and
which can be divided into several groups;
the expressions belonging to the single
groups are supposed to be differentiated
primarily by their mutual ordering, which
dictates their scope properties and whose
violation yields ungrammaticality (cf.
IV). The adverbial expressions belonging

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984462571428571">
A SENTENCE
In the underlying representations
of sentences in FGD, CA can be generated
essentially on two principles of
multiple occurrence of a complementation
inside a sentence.
(i) Firstly, there can be generated
in the focus (and in the secondary case,
also in the topic) of a sentence
clusters of two or more occurrences of
CA, which differ in the degrees of their
communicative dynamism; there hold
specific scope relations between them;
the CA expression with the highest
degree of communicative dynamism in the
cluster has in its scope the rest of the
focus of a sentence (in the primary
case), or the rest of the topic (in the
secondary case); the other CA
expressions in the cluster have in their
scopes the rest of the cluster.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995619">
78
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.950352166666667">
If the adverbial expressions inside
the cluster belong to different groups of
CA, they obey a certain kind of ordering
(as suggested by the listing in III D.),
whose violation yields ungrammaticality
(cf. 8 vs. 9).i If, however, the
adverbial expressions occurring inside
the cluster belong to the same group,
they cooccur without any restrictions
on their order.
8 Terry will run /
probably not only to Brooklyn.

only not probably to Brooklyn.
If two occurrences of CA are
detached by the boundness juncture
of a sentence, they may cooccur without
any restrictions on their order because
their scopes do not overlap; of. 10,
containing two negations.
10 Terry did not sing /
not because of Mary.
(ii) Secondly, we suppose that on
the coordinative-appositive principle of
multiple occurrence of a complementation
inside a sentence, the occurrences of a
complementation do not differ in their
degrees of communicative dynamism, and
hence, that their order does not
correspond directly to the principles of
the TFA of a sentence: a coordinative or
appositive unit presumably occupies, in
the underlying representation of a
sentence, the position of one &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; in
the deep word-order. In TRs of sentences
in FGD, coordination and apposition are
not represented by means of the
dependency tree, but require a special
device. Thus, coordinative and appositive
occurrences of CA have identical scopes:
in 11, probably and certainly have in
their scopes Terry will run to Brooklyn,
3 On the multiple occurrence of CA
within the loose occurrence thereof or
within the coordinative-appositive
multiple occurrence thereof, CA
expressions do not obey the ordering
suggested in III D; cf. a.
a. Tragically but not surprisingly,
Terry loves Mary.
and in 12, Terry loves Mary. In the
linear representation, it is not possible
to indicate the scopes by arrows.

to Brooklyn.

Terry loves Mary.

themselves provide a clue for
the disambiguation of the topic-focus

<abstract confidence="0.999464086956522">In the present paper we argue that the so—called sentence adverbials adverbs like admittedly,...)should be generated, in the framework of Functional Generative Description, by means of a special deep case — Complementation of Attitude (CA) on grounds of their special behaviour in the topic—focus articulation (TFA) of a sentence. From the viewpoint of the translation of CA expressions (and also of the multiple occurrence thereof inside a sentence) into a calculus of intensional logic, it should be noted that the TFA properties of CA expressions are directly correlated to the scope properties thereof. Our approach, which is stated in terms of a linguistic theory, serves as a basis for an algorithm of analysis of CA for purposes of a system of man—machine communication without a pre—arranged data base.</abstract>
