<bodyText confidence="0.999781260869565">
Identifying domain-dependent opinion
words is a key problem in opinion mining
and has been studied by several researchers.
However, existing work has been focused
on adjectives and to some extent verbs.
Limited work has been done on nouns and
noun phrases. In our work, we used the
feature-based opinion mining model, and we
found that in some domains nouns and noun
phrases that indicate product features may
also imply opinions. In many such cases,
these nouns are not subjective but objective.
Their involved sentences are also objective
sentences and imply positive or negative
opinions. Identifying such nouns and noun
phrases and their polarities is very
challenging but critical for effective opinion
mining in these domains. To the best of our
knowledge, this problem has not been
studied in the literature. This paper proposes
a method to deal with the problem.
Experimental results based on real-life
datasets show promising results.

finding such words is that opinions expressed by
many of them are domain or context dependent.
Several researchers have studied the problem of
finding opinion words (Liu, 2010). The approaches
can be grouped into corpus-based approaches
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Wiebe,
2000; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Qiu et al.,
2009) and dictionary-based approaches (Hu and
Liu 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Kamps et al.,
2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Takamura et al.,
2005; Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Dragut et
al., 2010). Dictionary-based approaches are
generally not suitable for finding domain specific
opinion words as dictionaries contain little domain
specific information.
Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) did the
first work to tackle the problem for adjectives
using a corpus. The approach exploits some
conjunctive patterns, involving and, or, but, either-
or, or neither-nor, with the intuition that the
conjoining adjectives subject to linguistic
constraints on the orientation or polarity of the
adjectives involved. Using these constraints, one
can infer opinion polarities of unknown adjectives
based on the known ones. Kanayama and
Nasukawa (2006) improved this work by using the
idea of coherency. They deal with both adjectives
and verbs. Ding et al. (2008) introduced the
concept of feature context because the polarities of
many opinion bearing words are sentence context
dependent rather than just domain dependent. Qiu
et al. (2009) proposed a method called double
propagation that uses dependency relations to
extract both opinion words and product features.

<bodyText confidence="0.999934951219512">
However, none of these approaches handle nouns
or noun phrases. Although Zagibalov and Carroll
(2008) noticed the issue, they did not study it.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) used WordNet to
determine polarities of words, which can include
nouns. However, dictionaries do not contain
domain specific information.
Our work uses the feature-based opinion mining
model in (Hu and Liu, 2004) to mine opinions in
product reviews. We found that in some
application domains product features which are
indicated by nouns have implied opinions although
they are not subjective words.
This paper aims to identify such opinionated
noun features. To make this concrete, let us see an
example from a mattress review: “Within a month,
a valley formed in the middle of the mattress.”
Here “valley” indicates the quality of the mattress
(a product feature) and also implies a negative
opinion. The opinion implied by “valley” cannot
be found by current techniques.
Although Riloff et al. (2003) proposed a method
to extract subjective nouns, our work is very
different because many nouns implying opinions
are not subjective nouns, but objective nouns, e.g.,
“valley” and “hole” on a mattress. Those sentences
involving such nouns are usually also objective
sentences. As much of the existing opinion mining
research focuses on subjective sentences, we
believe it is high time to study objective words and
sentences that imply opinions as well. This paper
represents a positive step towards this direction.
Objective words (or sentences) that imply
opinions are very difficult to recognize because
their recognition typically requires the
commonsense or world knowledge of the
application domain. In this paper, we propose a
method to deal with the problem, specifically,
finding product features which are nouns or noun
phrases and imply positive or negative opinions.
Our experimental results show promising results.
</bodyText>

2 The Proposed Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.816677857142857">
We start with some observations. For a product
feature (or feature for short) with an implied
opinion, there is either no adjective opinion word
that modifies it directly or the opinion word that
modify it usually have the same opinion.
Example 1: No opinion adjective word modifies
the opinionated product feature (“valley”):
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.7236965">
“Within a month, a valley formed in the middle
of the mattress.”
Example 2: An opinion adjective modifies the
opinionated product feature:
“Within a month, a bad valley formed in the
middle of the mattress.”
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990111111111">
Here, the adjective “bad” modifies “valley”. It is
unlikely that a positive opinion word will modify
“valley”, e.g., “good valley” in this context. Thus,
if a product feature is modified by both positive
and negative opinion adjectives, it is unlikely to be
an opinionated product feature.
Based on these examples, we designed the
following two steps to identify noun product
features which imply positive or negative opinions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.863908">
1. Candidate Identification: This step determines
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9938982">
the surrounding sentiment context of each noun
feature. The intuition is that if a feature occurs
in negative (respectively positive) opinion
contexts significantly more frequently than in
positive (or negative) opinion contexts, we can
infer that its polarity is negative (or positive). A
statistical test is used to test the significance.
This step thus produces a list of candidate
features with positive opinions and a list of
candidate features with negative opinions.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9834654">
2. Pruning: This step prunes the two lists. The
idea is that when a noun product feature is
directly modified by both positive and negative
opinion words, it is unlikely to be an
opinionated product feature.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992143">
Basically, step 1 needs the feature-based sentiment
analysis capability. We adopt the lexicon-based
approach in (Ding et al. 2008) in this work.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991381">
2.1 Feature-Based Sentiment Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999488285714286">
To use the lexicon-based sentiment analysis
method, we need a list of opinion words, i.e., an
opinion lexicon. Opinion words are words that
express positive or negative sentiments. As noted
earlier, there are also many words whose polarities
depend on the contexts in which they appear.
Researchers have compiled sets of opinion
words for adjectives, adverbs, verbs and nouns
respectively, called the opinion lexicon. In this
paper, we used the opinion lexicon complied by
Ding et al. (2008). It is worth mentioning that our
task is to find nouns which imply opinions in a
specific domain, and such nouns do not appear in
any general opinion lexicon.

2.1.1. Aggregating Opinions on a Feature
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976866666667">
Using the opinion lexicon, we can identify opinion
polarity expressed on each product feature in a
sentence. The lexicon based method in (Ding et al.
2008) basically combines opinion words in the
sentence to assign a sentiment to each product
feature. The sketch of the algorithm is as follows.
Given a sentence s which contains a product
feature f, opinion words in the sentence are first
identified by matching with the words in the
opinion lexicon. It then computes an orientation
score for f. A positive word is assigned the
semantic orientation (polarity) score of +1, and a
negative word is assigned the semantic orientation
score of -1. All the scores are then summed up
using the following score formula:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998214666666667">
score(f)  
wi.SO (1)
W:WsAWL dis(wi, f )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949636363636">
where wi is an opinion word, L is the set of all
opinion words (including idioms) and s is the
sentence that contains the feature f, and dis(wi, f) is
the distance between feature f and opinion word wi
in s. wi.SO is the semantic orientation (polarity) of
word wi. The multiplicative inverse in the formula
is used to give low weights to opinion words that
are far away from the feature f.
If the final score is positive, then the opinion on
the feature in s is positive. If the score is negative,
then the opinion on the feature in s is negative.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.930965">
2.1.2. Rules of Opinions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99953272">
Several language constructs need special handling,
for which a set of rules is applied (Ding et al.,
2008; Liu, 2010). A rule of opinion is an
implication with an expression on the left and an
implied opinion on the right. The expression is a
conceptual one as it represents a concept, which
can be expressed in many ways in a sentence.
Negation rule. A negation word or phrase
usually reverses the opinion expressed in a
sentence. Negation words include “no,” “not”, etc.
In this work, we also discovered that when
applying negation rules, a special case needs extra
care. For example, “I am not bothered by the hump
on the mattress” is a sentence from a mattress
review. It expresses a neutral feeling from the
person. However, it also implies a negative opinion
about “hump,” which indicates a product feature.
We call this kind of sentences negated feeling
response sentences. A sentence like this normally
expresses the feeling of a person or a group of
persons towards some items which generally have
positive or negative connotations in the sentence
context or the application domain. Such a sentence
usually consists of four components: a noun
representing a person or a group of persons (which
includes personal pronoun and proper noun), a
negation word, a feeling verb, and a stimulus word.
Feeling verbs include “bother,” “disturb,” “annoy,”
etc. The stimulus word, which stimulates the
feeling, also indicates a feature. In analyzing such
a sentence, for our purpose, the negation is not
applied. Instead, we regard the sentence bearing
the same opinion about the stimulus word as the
opinion of the feeling verb. These opinion contexts
will help the statistical test later.
But clause rule. A sentence containing “but”
also needs special treatment. The opinion before
“but” and after “but” are usually the opposite to
each other. Phrases such as “except that” and
“except for” behave similarly.
Deceasing and increasing rules. These rules
say that deceasing or increasing of some quantities
associated with opinionated items may change the
orientations of the opinions. For example, “The
drug eased my pain”. Here “pain” is a negative
opinion word in the opinion lexicon, and the
reduction of “pain” indicates a desirable effect of
the drug. We have compiled a list of such words,
which include “decease”, “diminish”, “prevent”,
“remove”, etc. The basic rules are as follows:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.78511575">
Decreased Neg — Positive
E.g: “My problem have certainly diminished”
Decreased Pos — Negative
E.g: “These tires reduce the fun of driving.”
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.815133666666667">
Neg and Pos represent respectively a negative
and a positive opinion word. Increasing rules do
not change opinion directions (Liu, 2010).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.790001">
2.1.3. Handing Context-Dependent Opinions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932">
As mentioned earlier, context-dependent opinion
words (only adjectives and adverbs) must be
determined by its contexts. We solve this problem
by using the global information rather than only
the local information in the current sentence. We
use a conjunction rule. For example, if someone
writes a sentence like “This camera is very nice
and has a long battery life”, we can infer that
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.984927">
577
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998690666666667">
“long” is positive for “battery life” because it is
conjoined with the positive word “nice.” This
discovery can be used anywhere in the corpus.

2.2 Determining Candidate Noun Product
Features that Imply Opinions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975761904762">
Using the sentiment analysis method in section 2.1,
we can identify opinion sentences for each product
feature in context, which contains both positive-
opinionated sentences and negative-opinionated
sentences. We then determine candidate product
features implying opinions by checking the
percentage of either positive-opinionated sentences
or negative-opinionated sentences among all
opinionated sentences. Through experiments, we
make an empirical assumption that if either the
positive-opinionated sentence percentage or the
negative-opinionated sentence percentage is
significantly greater than 70%, we regard this noun
feature as a noun feature implying an opinion. The
basic heuristic for our idea is that if a noun feature
is more likely to occur in positive (or negative)
opinion contexts (sentences), it is more likely to be
an opinionated noun feature. We use a statistic
method test for population proportion to perform
the significant test. The details are as follows. We
compute the Z-score statistic with one-tailed test.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8357895">
p p
— 0
p0 (1— p0) (2)
n
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999683">
where p0 is the hypothesized value (0.7 in our
case), p is the sample proportion, i.e., the
percentage of positive (or negative) opinions in our
case, and n is the sample size, which is the total
number of opinionated sentences that contain the
noun feature. We set the statistical confidence level
to 0.95, whose corresponding Z score is -1.64. It
means that Z score for an opinionated feature must
be no less than -1.64. Otherwise we do not regard
it as a feature implying opinion.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999621">
2.3 Pruning Non-Opinionated Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873733333333">
Many of candidate noun features with opinions
may not indicate any opinion. Then, we need to
distinguish features which have implied opinions
and normal features which have no opinions, e.g.,
“voice quality” and “battery life.” For normal
features, people often can have different opinions.
For example, for “voice quality”, people can say
“good voice quality” or “bad voice quality.”
However, for features with context dependent
opinions, people often have a fixed opinion, either
positive or negative but not both. With this
observation in mind, we can detect features with
no opinion by finding direct modification relations
using a dependency parser. To be safe, we use only
two types of direct relations:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.70094">
Type1: O 4 O-Dep 4 F
It means O depends on F through a relation O-
Dep. E.g: “This TV has a good picture quality.”
Type 2: O 4 O-Dep 4 H F F-Dep F F
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.995759421052631">
It means both O and F depends on H through
relation O-Dep and F-Dep respectively. E.g:
“The springs of the mattress are bad.”
Here O is an opinion word, O-Dep / F-Dep is a
dependency relation, which describes a relation
between words, and includes mod, pnmod, subj, s,
obj, obj2 and desc (detailed explanations can be
found in http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/
minipar.htm). F is a noun feature. H means any
word. For the first example, given feature “picture
quality”, we can extract its modification opinion
word “good”. For the second example, given
feature “springs”, we can get opinion word “bad”.
Here H is the word “are”.
Among these extracted opinion words for the
feature noun, if some belong to the positive
opinion lexicon and some belong to the negative
opinion lexicon, we conclude the noun feature is
not an opinionated feature and is thus pruned.

We conducted experiments using four diverse real-
life datasets of reviews. Table 1 shows the domains
(based on their names) of the datasets, the number
of sentences, and the number of noun features. The
first two datasets were obtained from a commercial
company that provides opinion mining services,
and the other two were crawled by us.

For comparison, we also implemented a baseline
method, which decides a noun feature’s polarity
only by its modifying opinion words (adjectives).
If its corresponding adjective is positive-orientated,
then the noun feature is positive-orientated. The
same goes for a negative-orientated noun feature.
Then using the same techniques in section 2.3 for
statistical test (in this case, n in equation 2 is the
total number of sentences containing the noun
feature) and for pruning, we can determine noun
features implying opinions from the data corpus.
Table 2 gives the experimental results. The
performances are measured using the standard
evaluation measures of precision and recall. From
Table 2, we can see that the proposed method is
much better than the baseline method on both the
recall and precision. It indicates many noun
features that imply opinions are not directly
modified by adjective opinion words. We have to
determine their polarities based on contexts.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865307692308">
This paper proposed a method to identify noun
product features that imply opinions. Conceptually,
this work studied the problem of objective nouns
and sentences with implied opinions. To the best of
our knowledge, this problem has not been studied
in the literature. This problem is important because
without identifying such opinions, the recall of
opinion mining suffers. Our proposed method
determines feature polarity not only by opinion
words that modify the features but also by its
surrounding context. Experimental results show
that the proposed method is promising. Our future
work will focus on improving the precision.

<abstract confidence="0.999533666666667">Identifying domain-dependent opinion words is a key problem in opinion mining and has been studied by several researchers. However, existing work has been focused on adjectives and to some extent verbs. Limited work has been done on nouns and noun phrases. In our work, we used the feature-based opinion mining model, and we found that in some domains nouns and noun phrases that indicate product features may also imply opinions. In many such cases, these nouns are not subjective but objective. Their involved sentences are also objective sentences and imply positive or negative opinions. Identifying such nouns and noun phrases and their polarities is very challenging but critical for effective opinion mining in these domains. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been studied in the literature. This paper proposes a method to deal with the problem. Experimental results based on real-life datasets show promising results.</abstract>

The approach exploits some conjunctive patterns, involving and, or, but, eitheror, or neither-nor, with the intuition that the conjoining adjectives subject to linguistic constraints on the orientation or polarity of the adjectives involved. Using these constraints, one can infer opinion polarities of unknown adjectives based on the known ones. Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) improved this work by using the idea of coherency. They deal with both adjectives and verbs. Ding et al. (2008) introduced the concept of feature context because the polarities of many opinion bearing words are sentence context dependent rather than just domain dependent. Qiu et al. (2009) proposed a method called double propagation that uses dependency relations to extract both opinion words and product features. 575 Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics:shortpapers, pages 575–580, Portland, Oregon, June 19-24, 2011. c�2011 Association for Computational Linguistics However, none of these approaches handle nouns or noun phrases.

A statistical test is used to test the significance. This step thus produces a list of candidate features with positive opinions and a list of candidate features with negative opinions. 2. Pruning: This step prunes the two lists. The idea is that when a noun product feature is directly modified by both positive and negative opinion words, it is unlikely to be an opinionated product feature. Basically, step 1 needs the feature-based sentiment analysis capability. We adopt the lexicon-based approach in (Ding et al. 2008) in this work. 2.1 Feature-Based Sentiment Analysis To use the lexicon-based sentiment analysis method, we need a list of opinion words, i.e., an opinion lexicon. Opinion words are words that express positive or negative sentiments. As noted earlier, there are also many words whose polarities depend on the contexts in which they appear. Researchers have compiled sets of opinion words for adjectives, adverbs, verbs and nouns respectively, called the opinion lexicon. In this paper, we used the opinion lexicon complied by Ding et al. (2008). It is worth mentioning that our task is to find nouns w</context>

The multiplicative inverse in the formula is used to give low weights to opinion words that are far away from the feature f. If the final score is positive, then the opinion on the feature in s is positive. If the score is negative, then the opinion on the feature in s is negative. 2.1.2. Rules of Opinions Several language constructs need special handling, for which a set of rules is applied (Ding et al., 2008; Liu, 2010). A rule of opinion is an implication with an expression on the left and an implied opinion on the right. The expression is a conceptual one as it represents a concept, which can be expressed in many ways in a sentence. Negation rule. A negation word or phrase usually reverses the opinion expressed in a sentence. Negation words include “no,” “not”, etc. In this work, we also discovered that when applying negation rules, a special case needs extra care. For example, “I am not bothered by the hump on the mattress” is a sentence from a mattress review. It expresses a neutral feeling f</context>

They are critical for opinion mining (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Hu and Liu, 2004; Wilson et al., 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Gamon et al., 2005; Ku et al., 2006; Breck et al., 2007; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Ding et al., 2008; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Pang and Lee, 2008; Lu et al., 2009). The key difficulty in finding such words is that opinions expressed by many of them are domain or context dependent. Several researchers have studied the problem of finding opinion words (Liu, 2010). The approaches can be grouped into corpus-based approaches (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Wiebe, 2000; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Qiu et al., 2009) and dictionary-based approaches (Hu and Liu 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Kamps et al., 2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Takamura et al., 2005; Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Dragut et al., 2010). Dictionary-based approaches are generally not suitable for finding domain specific opinion words as dictionaries contain little domain specific information. Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) did the first work to tackle the problem for adjective</context>
<context position="9366" citStr="Liu, 2010" startWordPosition="1483" endWordPosition="1484">) and s is the sentence that contains the feature f, and dis(wi, f) is the distance between feature f and opinion word wi in s. wi.SO is the semantic orientation (polarity) of word wi. The multiplicative inverse in the formula is used to give low weights to opinion words that are far away from the feature f. If the final score is positive, then the opinion on the feature in s is positive. If the score is negative, then the opinion on the feature in s is negative. 2.1.2. Rules of Opinions Several language constructs need special handling, for which a set of rules is applied (Ding et al., 2008; Liu, 2010). A rule of opinion is an implication with an expression on the left and an implied opinion on the right. The expression is a conceptual one as it represents a concept, which can be expressed in many ways in a sentence. Negation rule. A negation word or phrase usually reverses the opinion expressed in a sentence. Negation words include “no,” “not”, etc. In this work, we also discovered that when applying negation rules, a special case needs extra care. For example, “I am not bothered by the hump on the mattress” is a sentence from a mattress review. It expresses a neutral feeling from the pers</context>
<context position="11914" citStr="Liu, 2010" startWordPosition="1896" endWordPosition="1897">ientations of the opinions. For example, “The drug eased my pain”. Here “pain” is a negative opinion word in the opinion lexicon, and the reduction of “pain” indicates a desirable effect of the drug. We have compiled a list of such words, which include “decease”, “diminish”, “prevent”, “remove”, etc. The basic rules are as follows: Decreased Neg — Positive E.g: “My problem have certainly diminished” Decreased Pos — Negative E.g: “These tires reduce the fun of driving.” Neg and Pos represent respectively a negative and a positive opinion word. Increasing rules do not change opinion directions (Liu, 2010). 2.1.3. Handing Context-Dependent Opinions As mentioned earlier, context-dependent opinion words (only adjectives and adverbs) must be determined by its contexts. We solve this problem by using the global information rather than only the local information in the current sentence. We use a conjunction rule. For example, if someone writes a sentence like “This camera is very nice and has a long battery life”, we can infer that 577 “long” is positive for “battery life” because it is conjoined with the positive word “nice.” This discovery can be used anywhere in the corpus. 2.2 Determining Candid</context>

We found that in some application domains product features which are indicated by nouns have implied opinions although they are not subjective words. This paper aims to identify such opinionated noun features. To make this concrete, let us see an example from a mattress review: “Within a month, a valley formed in the middle of the mattress.” Here “valley” indicates the quality of the mattress (a product feature) and also implies a negative opinion. The opinion implied by “valley” cannot be found by current techniques. Although Riloff et al. (2003) proposed a method to extract subjective nouns, our work is very different because many nouns implying opinions are not subjective nouns, but objective nouns, e.g., “valley” and “hole” on a mattress. Those sentences involving such nouns are usually also objective sentences. As much of the existing opinion mining research focuses on subjective sentences, we believe it is high time to study objective words and sentences that imply opinions as well. This paper represents a positive step towards this direction. Objective words (or sentences) that imply opinions are very difficult to recognize beca</context>
