Although first names and nicknames in the
United States have been well documented,
there has been almost no quantitative analysis
on the usage and association of these names
amongst themselves. In this paper we in-
troduce the Intelius Nickname Collection, a
quantitative compilation of millions of name-
nickname associations based on information
gathered from billions of public records. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the largest
collection of its kind, making it a natural re-
source for tasks such as coreference resolu-
tion, record linkage, named entity recogni-
tion, people and expert search, information ex-
traction, demographic and sociological stud-
ies, etc. The collection will be made freely
available.

Nicknames are descriptive, invented person names
that are frequently used in addition or instead of the
person’s official name. Very often nicknames are
truncated forms of the original name that can be used
for convenience — for instance, ’Betsy’ instead of
’Elizabeth’.
Previous studies on nicknames have mostly fo-
cused on their origins or common descriptions. The
Oxford Dictionary of First Names (Hanks et al.,
2007), for instance, presents a comprehensive de-
scription of origins and common uses of most nick-
names in modern English. More quantitative explo-

the US Social Security Office1 tend to focus on baby
name selection and on the relative popularity of most
common first names.
In this paper we present a quantitative study on
nickname usage in the United States. Using bil-
lions of personal public records and a state-of-the-
art large-scale record linkage system, we were able
to generate a comprehensive dataset with millions
of name-nickname associations and their relative
strength. A small sample of this collection can
be seen in Table 1, where the most frequent nick-
names associated with the first name “Elizabeth”

plain the derivation of these probabilities in detail
in Section 3.3. This collection can provide valu-
able features and insights for applications as diverse
as entity extraction, coreference resolution, people
search, language modeling, and machine translation.
It will be made freely available for download from
the Linguistic Data Consortium.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no com-
prehensive, empirically derived nickname databases
currently made freely available for research pur-
poses. (Bollacker, 2008) contains an extensive
database of names and nicknames2, with listings
on over 13,000 given names, containing multi-
ple “variations” for each name. However, this
database makes no attempt to distinguish between
common and less common variants and skips some
very common nicknames. For instance, the en-
try for “William” lists “Wilmot” and “Wilton”
as variants of William but does not list “Bill”
or “Billy”. (Meranda, 1998) provides a more
useful database which appears to also be manu-
ally constructed. The database is in the form of
Name1|Name2|“substitution likelihood”, but the au-
thor states in the comments that the substitution like-
lihood is “mostly guesswork” and the data contains
numerous coverage gaps. For instance, common
nicknames such as “Jack”, “Willy”, and “Sally” are
all missing.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977125">
The nickname collection was derived from billions
of public, commercial and web records that power a
major commercial People Search Engine. The pro-
cess described below associates all records belong-
ing to a particular person into clusters, and from
these clusters it constructs a final person profile that
is used to derive name-alias associations. The entire
process is briefly described below.

3.1 Data Collection and Cleaning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904833333333">
The process starts by collecting billions of personal
records from three different sources of U.S. per-
sonal records. The first source is derived from US
government records, such as marriage, divorce and
death records. The second is derived from publicly
available web profiles, such as professional and so-
cial network public profiles. The third type is de-
rived from commercial sources, such as financial
and property reports (e.g., information made public
after buying a house).
After collection and categorization, all records go
through a cleaning process that starts with the re-

moval of bogus, junk and spam records. Then all
records are normalized to an approximately com-
mon representation. Then finally, all major noise
types and inconsistencies are addressed, such as
empty/bogus fields, field duplication, outlier values
and encoding issues. At this point, all records are
ready for the Record Linkage process.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999759">
3.2 Record Linkage Process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998210472222222">
The Record Linkage process should link together
all records belonging to the same real-world per-
son. That is, this process should turn billions of in-
put records into a few hundred million clusters of
records (or profiles), where each cluster is uniquely
associated with a real-world unique individual.
Our system follows the standard high-level struc-
ture of a record linkage pipeline (Elmagarmid et al.,
2007) by being divided into four major components:
1) data cleaning 2) blocking 3) pair-wise linkage and
4) clustering. The data cleaning step was described
above. The blocking step uses a new algorithm im-
plemented in MapReduce (Dean et al., 2004) which
groups records by shared properties to determine
which pairs of records should be examined by the
pairwise linker as potential duplicates. The linkage
step assigns a score to pairs of records using a super-
vised pairwise-based machine learning model whose
implementation is described in detail in (Sheng et
al., 2011) and achieves precision in excess of 99.5%
with recall in excess of 80%, as measured on a ran-
dom set with tens of thousands of human labels.
If a pair scores above a user-defined threshold, the
records are presumed to represent the same person.
The clustering step first combines record pairs into
connected components and then further partitions
each connected component to remove inconsistent
pair-wise links. Hence at the end of the entire record
linkage process, the system has partitioned the input
records into disjoint sets called profiles, where each
profile corresponds to a single person. While the
task is very challeging (e.g., many people share com-
mon names such as ”John Smith”) and this process
is far from perfect, it is working sufficiently well to
power multiple products at Intelius, including a ma-
jor people search engine.

3.3 Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995040106382979">
We used the MapReduce framework (Dean et al.,
2004) to accomodate operations over very large
datasets. The main goal of this task is to preserve
the relationship amongst different names inside a
profile. The algorithm’s pseudocode is illustrated in
Figure 1.
Many different names can be listed under a pro-
file, including the real name (e.g., the “official” or
“legal” name), nicknames, diminutives, typos, etc.
In the first phase of the algorithm, a mapper visits all
profiles to reveal these names and outputs a &lt;key,
value&gt;pair for each name token. The keys are the
names, and the values are a list with all other names
found in the profile. This is a safe approach since we
do not attempt to determine whether a given token is
an original name, a diminutive or a typo. Hence-
forth, we refer to the key as Name and the values as
Aliases.
The reducer will merge all alias lists of a given
name, and count, aggregate and filter them. Since
the mapper function produces intermediate pairs
with all different names seen inside a profile, re-
ducing them will create a bi-directional relation be-
tween names and aliases, where one can search for
all aliases of a name as well as the reverse. The re-
ducer also estimates conditional probabilities of the
aliases. The Conditional Alias Probability (CAP)
of an alias defines the probability of an alias being
used to denote a person with a given name. Specifi-
cally, It can be expressed as CAP(aliasi|named) =
count(aliasinnamej), where the count() operator re-
count(namej )
turns the number of profiles satisfying its criteria.
Processing a large number of profiles creates a
huge alias lists for each name. Even worse, most
of the aliases in that list are typos or very unique
nicknames that would not be considered a typical
alias for the name. In order to help control this
noise, we used the following parameters in the al-
gorithm. Alias Count Minimum sets the minimum
number of profiles that should have an alias for
the alias to be included. Total Count Minimum
determines whether we output the whole set of
name and aliases. It is determined by comput-
ing the total number of occurrences of the name.
CAP Threshold forces the reducer to filter out
aliases whose probability is below a threshold.

3.4 Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9942236">
The number of generated name-alias associations
depends largely on the specific parameter set used
in by the algorithm. While different applications
may benefit from different parameters, many of our
internal applications had success using the follow-
ing set of parameters: Total Count Minimum =
100, Alias Count Minimum = 10, and
CAP Threshold = 0.1%. Using this parameter
set, the process generated 331,237 name-alias pairs.
Table 2 shows CAP values for various name-
alias pairs. As expected, notice that values
of CAP(X|Y ) can be completely different from
CAP(Y |X), as in the case of “Monica” and
“Monic”. The collection also shows that completely
unrelated names can be associated to a short alias,
such as “Al”. Notice also that very frequent ty-
pos, such as“Jefffrey”, are also part of the collection.
Finally, very common name abbreviations such as
“Jas” for “James” are also part of the set as long as
they are statistically relevant.

dresses, date of birth (DOB), professional titles, etc.
As an example, Figure 2 illustrates the probability of
the most frequent nicknames of ’William’ for people
born over different decades in the US. It is interest-
ing to notice that, while ’Bill’ was the most likely
nickname for people born between the 1940s and
1980s, ’Will’ has become significantly more popu-
lar since the 80s - to the point that it has become
the most likely nickname in the 90s. We believe our
next steps will include investigating various migra-
tion, economic, sociological and demographic pat-
terns while also leveraging this information in record
linkage and coreference resolution modules.

<bodyText confidence="0.999983722222222">
It is important to keep in mind that the collection
is only valid for adults in the USA. Also, despite the
noise reduction obtained by the algorithm thresholds
in Section 3.3, some cases of frequent typos, for-
eign spellings/transliterations, and abbreviations are
still statistically indistinguishable from actual nick-
names. For instance, ’WM’ (a common abbreviation
of William) is as frequent as many of its nicknames.
While we could have used a human-edited list to fil-
ter out these cases, we decided to keep it in the col-
lection because some applications may benefit from
this information. A coreference application, for in-
stance, could infer that “Wm Jones” and “William
Jones” have a high probability of being the same per-
son.
Looking forward, there are multiple directions
to explore. Besides names, the final record clus-
ters generally contain other information such as ad-
