Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999525947368421">
A review of publications by and about
medical interpreters reveals a number of
operational similarities and shared atti-
tudes and beliefs with the medical coding
and abstracting community as it existed
ten years ago in the mid-1990&apos;s. At that
time, the first of what have now become
several successful commercial products
using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
for automated coding and abstracting ap-
peared. The initial reaction was that ma-
chines could never do what human coders
and abstractors do, and anecdotal ac-
counts illustrating the difficulty of the
task proliferated. The claims of superior
human capabilities and the accuracy of
the anecdotal accounts were and are sub-
stantially true, but the fact is that the ma-
chines are more capable than what they
were initially given credit for, and the
percentage of cases that can be handled
with automation fairly well approximates
the 80/20 rule.
In this paper, we present an early stage
prototype medical interpreter system that
is based on lessons learned in developing
successful automated coding and abstract-
ing systems and on the core infrastructure
and techniques used in these systems.
Specific techniques include leveraging
standards based multi-lingual medical
nomenclatures and clinical ontology sys-
tems, machine awareness of difficult
situations, explanatory meta-knowledge,
and an interactive environment that em-
phasizes the strengths of both the human
and machine participants and mitigates
the weaknesses of each.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961447058824">
The task of medical interpretation is demanding
and difficult, and although U.S. hospitals that re-
ceive federal funds are required to provide inter-
preter services, the demands on the system are
generally beyond the availability of qualified inter-
preters. Less than one fourth of U.S. hospitals
have professionally trained interpreters and among
these, many have no training in medical terminol-
ogy. [Loviglio, 2004] After noting that well-to-do,
educated patients have a relatively similar grasp of
the process and content of medical care regardless
of national or cultural origin, Haffner [1992] de-
scribes a variety of scenarios in which communica-
tion regarding medical treatment is far more diffi-
cult with the poor and under-educated. Karliner,
Perez-Stable and Gildengorin [2004] formalize the
study of medical interpreting, expand on the ad hoc
observations of interpreters, and detail many of the
challenges and pitfalls that befall the medical in-
terpreter as well as the errors in medical care that
may arise from inadequate cross-language and
cross-cultural communications. These include
hesitancy of patients to communicate fully and
openly with physicians due to embarrassment or
cultural norms, misunderstandings regarding of-
fered treatments based on differing medical prac-
tices in the patient&apos;s native environment, and, in
some cases, a lack of terminology by which west-
ern medical concepts can be easily translated to the
patient.
As in other areas of medicine such as medical
coding and abstracting, the problem of an inter-
preter shortage is not likely to be self-limiting. For
this reason, machine translation has undeniable
interest. The demands of medicine, however, re-
quire that the matter be approached in a manner
different or more comprehensive than those em-
ployed in translating web pages or interpreting
tourism related queries and responses. Specific
needs of both physicians and patients motivate the
quest for medically accurate and culturally attuned
communication. Experience in building successful
systems that use NLP to automate medical coding
and abstracting tasks teaches that success is
achieved not in trying to create a machine that re-
places the human but rather is achieved by creating
a machine that assists and augments the human
practitioner. Specifically, the machine should off-
load the portions of the job that are mundane, re-
petitive and that can be successfully automated. In
the coding and abstracting area where A-Life
Medical processes the free-text transcriptions for
over two million clinical encounters per month,
this equates to about 70% of the total volume.
[Morris, et al., 2000] A second aspect of success-
ful human-machine collaboration is that the ma-
chine needs the ability to accurately differentiate
between language-based content that it can process
independently and that which requires human re-
view and/or intervention. We call this semi-
knowledge in that it corresponds to the human ca-
pability to recognize that an utterance is of impor-
tance to the task at hand even though the full intent
is not comprehended. In such cases, the machine
must, like a human, seek expert guidance. In this
regard, the machine will address the issue to a hu-
man expert, but the strengths of the machine can be
used to provide on-line help and meta-data as an
aid to the human expert. This is particularly help-
ful in the medical field where the sheer volume of
knowledge is frequently beyond the ability of hu-
mans to keep in ready memory.
In regard to the volume of knowledge, the
problem in medicine is in part mitigated by the on-
going developments in the area of medical
ontologies that provide for the unambiguous
representation of the majority of clinical concepts.
In particular, this project relies on the Systematic
Nomenclature of Medicine — Clinical Terminology
(SNOMED-CT®)1 for the core, multilingual
nomenclature of clinical concepts and the Clinical
Document Architecture, Release 2.0 (CDA2)
[Dolin, et al., 2005] for the framework by which
complex clinical events and communications can
be represented using the core nomenclature.

2 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997781">
More than 21 million residents of the United
States speak English poorly or not at all and for
more than 46 million, English is not the first lan-
guage. [Karliner, Perez-Stable and Gildengorin,
2004] In many urban settings, sizable minorities
of patients speak a language other than English.
[Loviglio, 2004] Unless the communications
needs of both the physician and patient are met, the
possibility for serious medical errors is exacer-
bated.

2.1 What Physicians Need
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906333333333">
All areas of physician-patient communication are
important to the quality of care, but the quality of
communication that is required can be divided ac-
cording to those communications that are only of
immediate importance during the course of the en-
counter and those that have durable importance
beyond the temporal scope of the encounter. For
example, physician directives for the patient to
stand, bend, take a deep breath, etc. are in the im-
mediate class and the accuracy of a translation (of-
ten augmented by signing, example, and physical
manipulation) can be easily judged by the patient&apos;s
actions. Conversely, acquiring the patient history,
the review of systems, explaining diagnoses and
prescribing medications and a course of treatment

have import that continues beyond the time scope
of the encounter in that they become part of the
permanent record, are a basis for both current and
future medical decision making, and are critical to
accurate completion of the course of care. Further,
it is the physician&apos;s responsibility, as the care pro-
vider, to ensure that the patient has been under-
stood and that the patient understands the nature of
their condition and the planned course of treat-
ment. Without a means to validate the communi-
cations that represent what we are calling the dura-
ble aspects, the physician can neither be sure nor
give assurance that the communications have been
accurate, and that the course of treatment is appro-
priate.
Another important area where medical interpre-
tation services are needed is physician-to-physician
communication. Telemedicine is on the rise in the
United States [Bauer, 2002] and worldwide. [Sood,
Bhatia, 2005] Many applications of telemedicine
involve communication between physicians lo-
cated in different countries. [Wachter, 2006] Ef-
fective physician-to-physician communication
usually requires proficiency in nuances medical
terminology and can be challenging even for phy-
sicians who are fluent in lay language. [Bruzzi,
2006]

2.2 What patients need
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972206896552">
Although communication that is primarily physi-
cian directed with yes/no or multiple-choice patient
responses can cover a lot of territory, there are sev-
eral areas for which it is necessary that the patient
be able to have a more comprehensive input.
These include the expression of concerns about the
severity and prospective outcome relative to their
medical condition, and communication of issues
relative to their life situation that contributed to
their condition or that may affect their ability to
follow medical instructions. Karliner, et al. [2004]
found that even when using interpreters, physician
satisfaction levels with regard to their ability to
elicit exact symptoms, explain treatments, elicit
treatment preferences, and empower patients with
regard to their own care was far lower than for the
physician&apos;s satisfaction with their ability to diag-
nose and treat the medical condition. During
medical encounters in which the physician and pa-
tient speak the same language, the physician may
likely initiate dialogue on these topics with open-
ended questions such as &amp;quot;How did this happen?&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Do you have any other questions?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Does this
concern you?&amp;quot;, and the like. Because the answers
to these questions may be complex and may be
influenced by cultural sensitivities [Hudelson,
2005], cultural context must be accounted for in
the design of an automated medical interpreter sys-
tem.

2.3 Statistical translation systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998944448275862">
Statistical translations systems have been devel-
oped for many language pairs, but due to the nature
of the available parallel training corpora one lan-
guage in most pairs is English. [Waibel, et al., May
2004] Further, statistical translation systems rely
on large parallel corpora for training and these may
not be available for applications in clinical medi-
cine. Advances in the general state of machine
translation can be tracked in the results of the
NIST Machine Translation Evaluations. [NIST,
2005] [Papineni, 2002] [Zhang, Vogel and Waibel,
2004] A more complete analysis that includes
measures of adequacy, fluency, and meaning main-
tenance can be found in Eck and Hori [2005], who
provide the following medical example that is il-
lustrative of the unevenness in these three areas of
measurement and demonstrates the need for other
methods beyond straight statistical translation.
Reference i would like to have an allergy test
please
Translation 1 i would like to have an allergy test
please
Translation 2 could you check I am allergic
Translation 3 i would like to make a
Translation 4 allergic to order room service please
Statistical systems can also be time and resource
intensive [Fung, et al., 2004] such that quality must
be sacrificed for speed in applications that require
near real-time response. [Peterson, 2006]

2.4 Interlingua translation systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939">
Interlingua approaches for clinical applications
seem to have a preferred status, in part due to the
constrained nature of clinical speech and in part
due to the ability to provide a structured back-
translation from the interlingua to the physician&apos;s
language for confirmation of adequacy, and in part
due to the fact that the interlingua provides a for-
mally represented, deep analysis of meaning.
[Schultz, et al., 2004] Two approaches to interlin-
gua are common:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997691">
1. a formal representation of meaning
[Bouillon, 2005]
2. a natural language, usually English, as in-
terlingua. [Waibel, et al., May 2004]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965277777778">
With regard to using a formal interlingua, map-
ping speech to an unambiguous formal representa-
tion that can be validated by the speaker provides
the requisite accuracy and a basis for accurate
translation, but the time and expense required to
build such a system for all patient languages is
prohibitive. Secondly, a formal interlingua will
not easily capture many nuances of natural lan-
guage.
The use of a natural language as the interlingua
provides the ability to represent a greater range of
nuance, although all languages have subtleties that
cannot easily be translated. Natural languages,
however, introduce the problem of double transla-
tion errors. Further, the interlingua may be a lan-
guage or format inaccessible to either speaker in a
conversation, and so there is no way for either
speaker to validate.

3 Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934741379311">
Our approach, currently designated as Accul-
tran/Med or just Accultran (for Accurate, Accul-
turated Translator) is based, both philosophically
and in terms of implementation, on LifeCode®
NLP system that has been developed at A-Life
Medical for coding and abstracting clinical docu-
ments. A complete description is beyond the scope
of this paper but is available in [Heinze, et al.
2001]. Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) is
performed using the SpeechMagicTM system from
Philips, which is currently available for twenty-
three languages. Non-CDA2/SNOMED-CT trans-
lations are via AltaVista Babelfish.
Many of the techniques in our approach are es-
tablished in the practice. Particularly we note the
use of physician directed communication with
yes/no patient responses, back-translation on the
physician side, and the use of multiple choice an-
swer selections for patient responses. [Kazunori, et
al., 2006] Beyond this, we are exploring the use of
CDA2 and SNOMED-CT as the interlingua for use
in those portions of the encounter where clinical
accuracy is essential, the use of semi-knowledge
for recognizing when an encounter is potentially
moving in directions where cross-cultural commu-
nications problems may arise, and the use of pa-
tient waiting time for patient directed acculturation
based on patient complaint information collected
upon presentation. The primary emphasis here will
be on the use of CDA2 and SNOMED-CT.
Based on the previous observations regarding
physician and patient communication needs during
a clinical encounter, we divide the clinical encoun-
ter into the following aspects: 1) establishing rap-
port; 2) chief complaint; 3) history; 4) review of
systems; 5) physical examination; 6) diagnoses; 7)
procedures; 8) medications; 9) instructions. Ex-
cept for item 1, these all correspond to sections of
the traditional clinical note or report and as such
have extensive representations in CDA2 and
SNOMED-CT. The Continuity of Care Document
(CCD), a current effort to harmonize the ASTM
and CDA2 standards in this realm, attempts to fo-
cus just on these elements using CDA2 representa-
tion capabilities. CDA2 is primarily declarative
with some capabilities to represent contingencies.
This is essentially what is needed for presenting
information, but much of the encounter requires
query and response.
The core of Accultran resides in the capability
of the NLP engine to determine the appropriate
context for each physician utterance and to appro-
priately process and route the content of the utter-
ance. The overall communications flow for the
system is illustrated in Figure 1, showing that upon
receiving and processing an utterance from the
physician, the NLP engine can choose one of sev-
eral courses of action:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996111769230769">
(1) Utterances that contain clinical questions or
clinical statements for the patient to affirm
or deny or instructions are: (a) converted to
CDA2 and are (b) processed by a style sheet
that produces the question/statement (c) first
for physician validation and then (d)
mapped to the patient language with, as
needed, a request to affirm or deny.
(2) Utterances with content that cannot be con-
verted to CDA2 are (a) routed to a general
machine translation system, (b) optionally
with back-translation and physician ap-
proval before (c) presentation to the patient.

and, as needed, revision.
The Cross-Cultural Advisor (CCA) module is a
key feature. Technically it is based on the NLP
engine&apos;s capability for recognizing and flagging
clinical content that requires special attention be-
yond what the NLP system can independently pro-
vide. In this case, the flags are associated with
warnings related to subject matter that is known to
have either cultural sensitivities for patients in the
target language group or that is difficult to translate
into the target language. Options that the CCA
could present to the physician for any particular
flag would include warnings with explanation of
the sensitivity, pre-formulated queries or informa-
tional presentations that are designed to mitigate
any misunderstandings, or advise that a human
interpreter be involved. In cases where the ser-
vices of a human interpreter are called for, the
CCA identified topic can be used to select, when
available, an interpreter with training or skills ap-
propriate to the case at hand. This can be particu-
larly useful when Video Medical Interpretation
(VMI) capabilities are used and there is a pool of
remote interpreters from which to select.

4 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990068181819">
As stated in the Introduction, Accultran is still an
early prototype. The NLP engine has been evalu-
ated at Partners Healthcare for mapping clinical
free-text to CDA2. Publication of these results is
expected in the near future. Development of the
translation aspects is not yet sufficiently mature for
field testing. Per work at A-Life, we currently see a
number of strengths and several particular short-
comings with regard to CDA2 and SNOMED-CT
as a framework for documenting and communicat-
ing clinical encounters. The strengths are in the
coverage of medical concepts, the ability to for-
mally assemble concepts in a coherent representa-
tion of an encounter, and the ability to easily map
that formal representation to a variety of applica-
tions via XSLT (XML Style Sheets) and alternate
language representation. However, although no-
menclatures such as SNOMED-CT provide cover-
age for concepts such as embarrassment, inappro-
priate behavior, identification of cultural and value
components related to pain management etc., they
do not provide information or insights into the ac-
tual cultural components that affect these concepts.
The cultural components must be developed sepa-
rately and added to the system as metadata at-
tached to specific semi-knowledge entries with
attached flags and helps. This notion can be fur-
ther expanded so as to use the considerable waiting
time that patients typically experience in medical
settings. During this time the patient would inter-
act with the system, which would provide language
and culture specific materials to educate and accul-
turate the patient.
Finally, and of no small import, SNOMED-CT
is currently only available in two versions of Eng-
lish (US and UK), German and Spanish. In the
US, at least, Spanish would be one of the primary
languages in need. Although there are no current
plans for complete and official versions of
SNOMED-CT in languages other than those just
noted (personal communication with author&apos;s
SNOMED account manager), our requirements are
for only a limited subset of the terms that could be
independently translated in a commercial setting.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964153846154">
The difficulty of medical interpreting and the po-
tential medical consequences should not be under-
estimated. Aside from the difficulties in sheer vo-
cabulary size and multi-lingual representation,
there are the added complications of diverse cul-
tures. We have presented an architecture that ad-
dresses the issues of medical accuracy and cultural
sensitivity. Although the use of such a system re-
quires some patience and acclimation on the part of
both medical practitioners and patients, the cost is
small as compared to that of any morbidity or mor-
tality that could result from inaccurate communica-
tion.

<abstract confidence="0.999498743589743">A review of publications by and about medical interpreters reveals a number of operational similarities and shared attitudes and beliefs with the medical coding and abstracting community as it existed ten years ago in the mid-1990&apos;s. At that time, the first of what have now become several successful commercial products using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automated coding and abstracting appeared. The initial reaction was that machines could never do what human coders and abstractors do, and anecdotal accounts illustrating the difficulty of the task proliferated. The claims of superior human capabilities and the accuracy of the anecdotal accounts were and are substantially true, but the fact is that the machines are more capable than what they were initially given credit for, and the percentage of cases that can be handled with automation fairly well approximates the 80/20 rule. In this paper, we present an early stage prototype medical interpreter system that is based on lessons learned in developing successful automated coding and abstracting systems and on the core infrastructure and techniques used in these systems. Specific techniques include leveraging standards based multi-lingual medical nomenclatures and clinical ontology systems, machine awareness of difficult situations, explanatory meta-knowledge, and an interactive environment that emphasizes the strengths of both the human and machine participants and mitigates the weaknesses of each.</abstract>

During medical encounters in which the physician and patient speak the same language, the physician may likely initiate dialogue on these topics with openended questions such as &amp;quot;How did this happen?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Do you have any other questions?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Does this concern you?&amp;quot;, and the like. Because the answers to these questions may be complex and may be influenced by cultural sensitivities [Hudelson, 2005], cultural context must be accounted for in the design of an automated medical interpreter system. 2.3 Statistical translation systems Statistical translations systems have been developed for many language pairs, but due to the nature of the available parallel training corpora one language in most pairs is English.

Less than one fourth of U.S. hospitals have professionally trained interpreters and among these, many have no training in medical terminology. [Loviglio, 2004] After noting that well-to-do, educated patients have a relatively similar grasp of the process and content of medical care regardless of national or cultural origin, Haffner [1992] describes a variety of scenarios in which communication regarding medical treatment is far more difficult with the poor and under-educated. Karliner, Perez-Stable and Gildengorin [2004] formalize the study of medical interpreting, expand on the ad hoc observations of interpreters, and detail many of the challenges and pitfalls that befall the medical interpreter as well as the errors in medical care that may arise</context>

[Karliner, Perez-Stable and Gildengorin, 2004] In many urban settings, sizable minorities of patients speak a language other than English. [Loviglio, 2004] Unless the communications needs of both the physician and patient are met, the possibility for serious medical errors is exacerbated. 2.1 What Physicians Need All areas of physician-patient communication are important to the quality of care, but the quality of communication that is required can be divided according to those communications that are only of immediate importance during the course of the encounter and those that have durable importance beyond the temporal scope of the encounter. For example, physician directives for the patient to stand, bend, take a deep breath, etc. are in the</context>

[Waibel, et al., May 2004] With regard to using a formal interlingua, mapping speech to an unambiguous formal representation that can be validated by the speaker provides the requisite accuracy and a basis for accurate translation, but the time and expense required to build such a system for all patient languages is prohibitive. Secondly, a formal interlingua will not easily capture many nuances of natural language. The use of a natural lang</context>
