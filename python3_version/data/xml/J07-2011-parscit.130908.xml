This book’s stated goal is to suggest ways
to optimize the incorporation of linguistic
knowledge about morphology into computer
systems. The book is composed of two quite
different parts. Part I (roughly half of the
book) defines computational linguistics as a
field. Part II presents a clear introduction
to computational morphology, primarily us-
ing examples from Russian. In addition to
basal concepts, this part presents a history of
morphological analysis systems for Russian;
various implementation options for practical
systems; an inventory of phenomena that, al-
though important for descriptive and theo-
retical morphology, have traditionally been
less important in computational applications;
and ongoing areas of research. The final chap-
ter argues that a core, general-purpose model
for Russian morphology is needed, and that
its development should be largely driven by
linguistic research. In the Afterword, the au-
thor emphasizes his belief that approaching
computational morphology as “a linguistic,
not a technical discipline” is the most “fruit-
ful” approach, because the real object of re-
search is language, not computer systems
(p. 131). The book seems most suited to lin-
guists or students of linguistics who are unac-
quainted with computational morphology.—
