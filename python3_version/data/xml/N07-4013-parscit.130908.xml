1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985312">
Traditional information extraction systems
have focused on satisfying precise, narrow,
pre-specified requests from small, homoge-
neous corpora. In contrast, the TEXTRUNNER
system demonstrates a new kind of informa-
tion extraction, called Open Information Ex-
traction (OIE), in which the system makes a
single, data-driven pass over the entire cor-
pus and extracts a large set of relational
tuples, without requiring any human input.
(Banko et al., 2007) TEXTRUNNER is a fully-
implemented, highly scalable example of OIE.
TEXTRUNNER&apos;s extractions are indexed, al-
lowing a fast query mechanism.
Our first public demonstration of the TEXT-
RUNNER system shows the results of perform-
ing OIE on a set of 117 million web pages. It
demonstrates the power of TEXTRUNNER in
terms of the raw number of facts it has ex-
tracted, as well as its precision using our novel
assessment mechanism. And it shows the abil-
ity to automatically determine synonymous re-
lations and objects using large sets of extrac-
tions. We have built a fast user interface for
querying the results.

<bodyText confidence="0.999780411764706">
The bulk of previous information extraction
work uses hand-labeled data or hand-crafted
patterns to enable relation-specific extraction
(e.g., (Culotta et al., 2006)). OIE seeks to
avoid these requirements for human input.
Shinyama and Sekine (Shinyama and
Sekine, 2006) describe an approach to “un-
restricted relation discovery” that does away
with many of the requirements for human in-
put. However, it requires clustering of the doc-
uments used for extraction, and thus scales in
quadratic time in the number of documents.
It does not scale to the size of the Web.
For a full discussion of previous work, please

zioni, 2007) for work relating to synonym res-
olution.

3 Open IE in TEXTRUNNER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999717588235294">
OIE presents significant new challenges for in-
formation extraction systems, including
Automation of relation extraction, which in
traditional information extraction uses hand-
labeled inputs.
Corpus Heterogeneity on the Web, which
makes tools like parsers and named-entity tag-
gers less accurate because the corpus is differ-
ent from the data used to train the tools.
Scalability and efficiency of the system.
Open IE systems are effectively restricted to
a single, fast pass over the data so that they
can scale to huge document collections.
In response to these challenges, TEXT-
RUNNER includes several novel components,
which we now summarize (see (Banko et al.,
2007) for details).
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.882026" genericHeader="method">
1. Single Pass Extractor
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971">
The TEXTRUNNER extractor makes a sin-
gle pass over all documents, tagging sen-
tences with part-of-speech tags and noun-
phrase chunks as it goes. For each pair of noun
phrases that are not too far apart, and subject
to several other constraints, it applies a clas-
sifier described below to determine whether or
not to extract a relationship. If the classifier

deems the relationship trustworthy, a tuple of
the form t = (ei, rj, ek) is extracted, where
ei, ek are entities and rj is the relation between
them. For example, TEXTRUNNER might ex-
tract the tuple (Edison, invented, light bulbs).
On our test corpus (a 9 million document sub-
set of our full corpus), it took less than 68
CPU hours to process the 133 million sen-
tences. The process is easily parallelized, and
took only 4 hours to run on our cluster.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.988044" genericHeader="method">
2. Self-Supervised Classifier
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942916666667">
While full parsing is too expensive to apply to
the Web, we use a parser to generate training
examples for extraction. Using several heuris-
tic constraints, we automatically label a set
of parsed sentences as trustworthy or untrust-
worthy extractions (positive and negative ex-
amples, respectively). The classifier is trained
on these examples, using features such as the
part of speech tags on the words in the re-
lation. The classifier is then able to decide
whether a sequence of POS-tagged words is a
correct extraction with high accuracy.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.771127" genericHeader="method">
3. Synonym Resolution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999642538461538">
Because TEXTRUNNER has no pre-defined re-
lations, it may extract many different strings
representing the same relation. Also, as with
all information extraction systems, it can ex-
tract multiple names for the same object. The
RESOLVER system performs an unsupervised
clustering of TEXTRUNNER&apos;s extractions to
create sets of synonymous entities and rela-
tions. RESOLVER uses a novel, unsupervised
probabilistic model to determine the probabil-
ity that any pair of strings is co-referential,
given the tuples that each string was extracted
with. (Yates and Etzioni, 2007)
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.872155" genericHeader="method">
4. Query Interface
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873769230769">
TEXTRUNNER builds an inverted index of
the extracted tuples, and spreads it across a
cluster of machines. This architecture sup-
ports fast, interactive, and powerful relational
queries. Users may enter words in a relation or
entity, and TEXTRUNNER quickly returns the
entire set of extractions matching the query.
For example, a query for “Newton” will return
tuples like (Newton, invented, calculus). Users
may opt to query for all tuples matching syn-
onyms of the keyword input, and may also opt
to merge all tuples returned by a query into
sets of tuples that are deemed synonymous.

4 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917642857143">
On our test corpus of 9 million Web doc-
uments, TEXTRUNNER extracted 7.8 million
well-formed tuples. On a randomly selected
subset of 400 tuples, 80.4% were deemed cor-
rect by human reviewers.
We performed a head-to-head compari-
son with a state-of-the-art traditional in-
formation extraction system, called KNOW-
ITALL. (Etzioni et al., 2005) On a set of ten
high-frequency relations, TEXTRUNNER found
nearly as many correct extractions as KNOW-
ITALL (11,631 to 11,476), while reducing the
error rate of KNOWITALL by 33% (18% to
12%).
