The Twelfth Annual Meeting of the North-Eastern
Linguistic Society will be held November 6-8, 1981, at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Plans are
also being made to hold a workshop immediately be-
fore the Meeting on the topic &amp;quot;Free Word-Order and
Syntactic Configuration&amp;quot;. Questions to be addressed
at the workshop include: what are the functions of
word-order in syntax and semantics? what degrees of
freedom are there of word-order? how should the
different functions and degrees of word-order be ex-
pressed within a theory of universal grammar?

Classification Research: Call for Papers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.944636135135135">
The 4th International Study Conference on Classi-
fication Research will take place in Augsburg, near
Munich, from June 28 to July 2, 1982, together with
the 6th Annual Conference of the German Society for
Classification. The conference is sponsored by the
Federation Internationale de Documentation (FID)
and is being hosted by the German Society for Docu-
mentation in connection with the German Institution
for Standardization.
The theme of the conference is Universal Classifi-
cation: Subject Analysis and Ordering Systems. Un-
der this topic universal classification systems are dealt
with, and it is suggested that classification should be
approached from a universal point of view, even when
using special classification systems and thesauri.
There will be plenary meetings and workshops with
presentations and discussions of contributions from all
those active and interested. Three major areas have
been identified for contributions: (1) general princi-
ples and policies, (2) structure and logics of classifica-
tion systems, and (3) practical use and empirical inves-
tigation. Additional sessions organized by the Special
Interest Group on Numerical Taxonomy of the Society
for Classification will be devoted to numerical me-
thods in classification.
Theoreticians and practitioners in the field of or-
ganization of knowledge (classification) are invited to
send abstracts of possible papers between 500 and
1000 words in length by December 1, 1981. A jury
will then select the papers for presentation and authors
will be notified. Papers presented will be published in
a proceedings volume. Papers will be due by May 1,
1982.
Abstracts should be sent to:

<bodyText confidence="0.998450733333333">
Cognition and Brain Theory is a new multidiscipli-
nary journal devoted to issues in mind, brain, and
language. The Editors are planning a special issue on
the topic of methodological principles for any one of
the following disciplines: philosophy, psychology,
linguistics, artificial intelligence, or brain theory. The
paper should delineate the key principles for framing
and investigating problems as well as the criteria for
evaluating solutions. The paper should also include a
discussion of the ways in which the method of the
discipline considered may relate — or fail to relate —
to other methods in the cognitive sciences. One paper
will be selected for each of the five disciplines men-
tioned above. Optimum size is 20-30 typewritten
pages.

The State University of New York at Buffalo has
formed a Graduate Group in Cognitive Science to
promote cognitive science research within the universi-
ty. The Graduate Group was founded by faculty and
graduate students from the Departments of Communi-
cation Sciences and Disorders, Computer Science,
Education, Law, Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychol-
ogy; members of other departments are being encour-
aged to join this interdisciplinary endeavor. The chief
concerns of the Graduate Group are in the areas of
language and knowledge representation. The first
Director of the Graduate Group is Stuart C. Shapiro
of the Department of Computer Science.
During the 1980-81 academic year, discussions
were held on such topics as intentionality, metaphor,
semantic representation, syntax and cognition, commu-
nicative competence (and its development) and theo-
ries of reference. In addition to continuing these tri-
weekly discussions, a series of colloquia in cognitive
science will be presented during the 1981-82 academic
year. In addition, several interdisciplinary graduate
courses in cognitive science are currently being plan-
ned. The Graduate Group intends to expand their
activities to developing a pre- and post-doctoral pro-
gram in cognitive science, along with the facilities
necessary to support the program.

This paper describes a number of extensions to
Brachman&apos;s Structured Inheritance Network (SI-Net)
formalism, with a view to creating an interactive sys-
tem which will enable domain experts to develop and
enhance knowledge networks (KNETs) representative
of their particular application domains. The three
principal extensions introduced are the QUA and VIZ
links, and augmented event transition networks. The
former permit us to partition the attribute space of
conceptual entities in accordance with the defining
roles played by these entities in certain kinds of socio-
legal interactions. We use an event transition network
to represent the value-class of so-called &amp;quot;dynamic
attributes&amp;quot; in order to define all (and only all) the
possible event sequences which the associated entity
can participate in relative to the given attribute and
still remain itself. The basic concept of simple succes-
sion of events in the transition network is then aug-
mented by conditions on dependency relations which
may exist across events among various roles (including
bounds on the amount of time that can elapse between
successive events). Since such event transition nets
are themselves concepts within the KNET formalism,
they can be placed along a specialization/generaliza-
tion hierarchy. We show how these KNET extensions
provide an extremely flexible basis for maintaining
data base integrity and consistency, determining roll-
back dependencies during error recovery or historical
perspectives, signalling possible irregularities in the
attempted recording of new events which violate the
legal event sequences defined by the net, as well as for
generating derivative sets and mutually non-exclusive
stative attribute values and associated interpretations
for the wide range of ways this opens up for referenc-
ing such concepts in natural language.

Under this topic universal classification systems are dealt with, and it is suggested that classification should be approached from a universal point of view, even when using special classification systems and thesauri. There will be plenary meetings and workshops with presentations and discussions of contributions from all those active and interested. Three major areas have been identified for contributions: (1) general principles and policies, (2) structure and logics of classification systems, and (3) practical use and empirical investigation. Additional sessions organized by the Special Interest Group on Numerical Taxonomy of the Society for Classification will be devoted to numerical methods in classification. Theoreticians and practitioners in the field of organization of knowledge (classification) are invited to send abstracts of possible papers between 500 and 1000 words in length by December 1, 1981. A jury will then select the papers for presentation and authors will be notified. Papers presented will be published in a proceedings volume. Papers will be due by May 1, 1982. Abstracts should be sent to: FID/CR Secretariat Woogstr. 36a D-6000 Frankfurt 50, WEST GERMANY Cognition and Brain Theory: Call for Papers and Brain Theory a new multidisciplinary journal devoted to issues in mind, brain, and language. The Editors are planning a special issue on the topic of methodological principles for any one of the following disciplines: philosophy, linguistics, artificial intelligence, or brain theory. The paper should delineate the key principles for framing and investigating problems as well as the criteria for evaluating solutions. The paper should also include a discussion of the ways in which the method of the discipline considered may relate — or fail to relate — to other methods in the cognitive sciences. One paper will be selected for each of the five disciplines mentioned above. Optimum size is 20-30 typewritten pages.</abstract>

The chief concerns of the Graduate Group are in the areas of language and knowledge representation. The first Director of the Graduate Group is Stuart C. Shapiro of the Department of Computer Science. During the 1980-81 academic year, discussions were held on such topics as intentionality, metaphor, semantic representation, syntax and cognition, communicative competence (and its development) and theories of reference. In addition to continuing these triweekly discussions, a series of colloquia in cognitive science will be presented during the 1981-82 academic year. In addition, several interdisciplinary graduate courses in cognitive science are currently being planned. The Graduate Group intends to expand their activities to developing a preand post-doctoral program in cognitive science, along with the facilities necessary to support the program.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.994344805555555">1980. This paper describes a number of extensions to Brachman&apos;s Structured Inheritance Network (SI-Net) formalism, with a view to creating an interactive system which will enable domain experts to develop and enhance knowledge networks (KNETs) representative of their particular application domains. The three principal extensions introduced are the QUA and VIZ links, and augmented event transition networks. The former permit us to partition the attribute space of conceptual entities in accordance with the defining roles played by these entities in certain kinds of sociolegal interactions. We use an event transition network to represent the value-class of so-called &amp;quot;dynamic attributes&amp;quot; in order to define all (and only all) the possible event sequences which the associated entity can participate in relative to the given attribute and still remain itself. The basic concept of simple succession of events in the transition network is then augmented by conditions on dependency relations which may exist across events among various roles (including bounds on the amount of time that can elapse between successive events). Since such event transition nets are themselves concepts within the KNET formalism, they can be placed along a specialization/generalization hierarchy. We show how these KNET extensions provide an extremely flexible basis for maintaining data base integrity and consistency, determining rollback dependencies during error recovery or historical perspectives, signalling possible irregularities in the attempted recording of new events which violate the legal event sequences defined by the net, as well as for generating derivative sets and mutually non-exclusive stative attribute values and associated interpretations for the wide range of ways this opens up for referencing such concepts in natural language.</abstract>
