<bodyText confidence="0.999894333333333">
This study investigates the support of
multiple information seeking strategies
(ISSs) within a single system, and the
relation between varieties of ISSs and
system design. It proposes to construct
and evaluate an interactive information
retrieval system which can adaptively
support multiple ISSs, and allow change
from one ISS to another within an ISS
space. It is conducted in a series of steps:
iterative designing -evaluating of several
systems supporting different ISSs;
specifying an interaction structure for
multiple ISSs; and, implementing and
evaluating a dynamically adaptive system
supporting multiple ISSs. The study aims
to make a contribution to interactive
information retrieval drawing attention to
user interface design, and to HCI, in
integration of multiple support techniques
within a single system framework.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993782051282">
Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems ask
people to specify queries using terms to select
documents from the selected databases. Current
research indicates some problems of such systems.
(1) Human information-seeking behavior is more
complicated than just query formulation and term
selection. For instance, people need to get an idea
of which domain or genre of information they
need, then familiarize themselves with the content
and structure of various databases. They need to
learn about a domain of interest and extend their
knowledge of this domain so that they can
formulate more effective queries. They need to
change their searching and seeking strategies to
improve their queries. (2) Human information-
seeking behaviors are not discrete processes. These
behaviors interact with one another during
information-seeking processes (Belkin, 1996). (3)
Interaction, not representation or comparison, is
the central process of IR (Belkin, 1993). (4) Users
with different goals need to use different
information-seeking strategies (ISSs) to conduct
searches. However, traditional IR systems only
support one ISS, that is, formulating queries using
terms to select documents from some databases
(Belkin, 1993, 1995; Xie, 2000). (5) It is known
that different ISSs can be optimally supported by
different combinations of IR techniques (Oddy,
1977). The existing diversity of ISSs indicates that
a system which provides good support for one ISS
is unlikely to provide good support for the others.
A system trying to support all ISSs with only one
technique will be able to support them at only
mediocre levels.
Therefore, the goal of the research is to design an
interactive IR system which incorporates different
IR techniques to adaptively support different ISSs.
Specifically, our solution to these problems
focuses mainly on the following two goals.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984772666666667">
(1) Constructing a single IR system in which
support techniques are explicitly represented
so that it is possible to shift from one
combination of support techniques to another
in real time, and appropriate support
techniques are suggested to the user by the
system.
(2) Evaluating the effectiveness and usability of
the system within controlled experiments.

<bodyText confidence="0.992653103448276">
SYSTEMS
Using the Lemur toolkit (LEMUR), we
implemented and evaluated several different
prototype IR systems designed to support scanning
(situation 1) or searching (situation 2). Table 1
describes the tasks, as well as features and support
techniques for each system.
HYPOTHESES
Hypothesis 1: The system summarizing each
database is more effective in supporting scanning
tasks than the baseline system which provides a
ranked list of documents with descriptions about
which databases these documents are in.
(E1.1/B1.1, situation1-task1)
Hypothesis 2: The system providing table of
contents navigation is more effective in supporting
scanning tasks than the baseline system which
lists ranked paragraphs. (E1.2/B1.2, situation1-
task2)
Hypothesis 3: The system presenting clustered
retrieval results is more effective in supporting
searching tasks than the baseline system which
presents a ranked list of retrieval results.
(E2.1/B2.1, situation2-task1)
Hypothesis 4: The system supporting fielded
queries is more effective in supporting searching
tasks than the baseline system which provides a
generic query search. (E2.2/B2.2, situation2-
task2)

<bodyText confidence="0.983779">
Participants conducted four searches on four
different topics that are suitable for scanning or
searching. This is a within-subjects design. Each
subject searched half of the topics in one system,
then half of the topics in the other system. Within
the topic block, the topic order was randomly
assigned. No two subjects used the same order of
topics and the same order of systems. The
experiments were replicated by exchanging the
order of the systems.
TEXT COLLECTIONS
There are two text collections: one is TREC
HARD 2004 collection (HARD) which is suitable
for situation1-task1 and situation2-task1, the other
is a book database which is good for situation1-
task2 and situation2-task2. This database is
composed of books downloaded from Project
Gutenberg (Gutenberg).
TASKS
In this study, we used the simulated work task
situation model (Borlund, 1997) to make subjects’
behavior as true-to-life as possible, hoping this will

make our results robust. Here is an example for
situation1-task1.
Topic: As a graduate student, you are
asked to write an essay about air pollution
for one of your courses. You are supposed
to get information you need from a system
that is composed of several databases.
Each database has lots of documents on a
variety of topics. You believe it would be
interesting to discover factors that cause air
pollution, but you have no idea which
databases are good on this topic.
Task: Please find out which databases are
good for this particular topic, and rank the
databases in order of likelihood of being
good. Put your answer in the given space.

3.2 Research Problem 2 (Future Work)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996615384615">
In order to guide the presentation of specific
support techniques during the information seeking
process, we need to specify an interaction
structure. This interaction structure is equivalent
to a dialogue manager, and can be used to control
the interactions between the system and the user.
We will employ the idea of interaction structure
developed in the MERIT system (Belkin, 1995).
This structure models human-computer interaction
as dialogues and particular dialogue structures are
associated with different ISSs. This structure will
be incorporated into the system at the user
interface level and act as the dialogue manager.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.822514">
3.3 Research Problem 3 (Future Work)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986834909090909">
SYSTEM
The integrated system will allow the user to use a
variety of ISSs and to seamlessly switch from one
ISS to another in the information-seeking process.
The user will be able to choose which ISS to use
at any time. ISSs will be classified according to
the goal of the interaction, the topic or task, and
the information-seeking stage, etc. The system
should be able to suggest to the user appropriate
ISSs at the appropriate times, given the current
state of the information- seeking process.
HYPOTHESIS
Hypothesis 5: The integrated system purposely
designed for supporting both scanning and
searching is more effective in supporting tasks
requiring scanning and searching than the generic
baseline system.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
This will be a within-subject experimental design.
The subjects will search the integrated system and
then the baseline system. The experiment will be
replicated by changing the order of the systems.

Our aim is to contribute to the field of interactive
