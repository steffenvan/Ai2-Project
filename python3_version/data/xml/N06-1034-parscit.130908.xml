We investigate using the PARADISE
framework to develop predictive models
of system performance in our spoken di-
alogue tutoring system. We represent per-
formance with two metrics: user satis-
faction and student learning. We train
and test predictive models of these met-
rics in our tutoring system corpora. We
predict user satisfaction with 2 parameter
types: 1) system-generic, and 2) tutoring-
specific. To predict student learning, we
also use a third type: 3) user affect. Al-
hough generic parameters are useful pre-
dictors of user satisfaction in other PAR-
ADISE applications, overall our parame-
ters produce less useful user satisfaction
models in our system. However, generic
and tutoring-specific parameters do pro-
duce useful models of student learning in
our system. User affect parameters can in-
crease the usefulness of these models.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.994745357142857">
In recent years the development of spoken dialogue
tutoring systems has become more prevalent, in an
attempt to close the performance gap between hu-
man and computer tutors (Mostow and Aist, 2001;
Pon-Barry et al., 2004; Litman et al., 2006). Student
learning is a primary metric for evaluating the per-
formance of these systems; it can be measured, e.g.,
by comparing student pretests taken prior to system
use with posttests taken after system use.
In other types of spoken dialogue systems, the
user’s subjective judgments about using the system
are often considered a primary system performance
metric; e.g., user satisfaction has been measured
via surveys which ask users to rate systems during
use along dimensions such as task ease, speech in-
put/output quality, user expectations and expertise,
and user future use (M¨oller, 2005b; Walker et al.,
2002; Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2000; Walker et al.,
2000; Shriberg et al., 1992). However, it is expen-
sive to run experiments over large numbers of users
to obtain reliable system performance measures.
The PARADISE model (Walker et al., 1997) pro-
poses instead to predict system performance, using
parameters representing interaction costs and bene-
fits between system and user, including task success,
dialogue efficiency, and dialogue quality. More for-
mally, a set of interaction parameters are measured
in a spoken dialogue system corpus, then used in
a multivariate linear regression to predict the target
performance variable. The resulting model is de-
scribed by the formula below, where there are n in-
teraction parameters, pi, each weighted by the anal-
ysis with a coefficient, wi, which will be negative
or positive, depending on whether the model treats
pi as a cost or benefit, respectively. The model can
then be used to estimate performance during system
design, with the design goals of minimizing costs
and maximizing benefits.

dictive models of performance in our spoken dia-
logue tutoring system. Although to our knowledge,

prior PARADISE applications have only used user
satisfaction to represent performance, we hypothe-
size that other metrics may be more relevant when
PARADISE is applied to tasks that are not optimized
for user satisfaction, such as our spoken dialogue tu-
toring system. We thus use 2 metrics to represent
performance: 1) a generic metric of user satisfaction
computed via user survey, 2) a tutoring-specific met-
ric of student learning computed via student pretest
and posttest scores. We train and test predictive
models of these metrics on multiple system corpora.
To predict user satisfaction, we use 2 types of in-
teraction parameters: 1) system-generic parameters
such as used in other PARADISE applications, e.g.
speech recognition performance, and 2) tutoring-
specific parameters, e.g. student correctness. To
predict student learning, we also use a third type of
parameter: 3) manually annotated user affect. Al-
though prior PARADISE applications have tended to
use system-generic parameters, we hypothesize that
task-specific and user affect parameters may also
prove useful. We emphasize that user affect parame-
ters are still system-generic; user affect has been an-
notated and/or automatically predicted in other types
of spoken dialogue systems, e.g. as in (Lee et al.,
2002; Ang et al., 2002; Batliner et al., 2003).
Our results show that, although generic param-
eters were useful predictors of user satisfaction in
other PARADISE applications, overall our parame-
ters produce less useful user satisfaction models in
our tutoring system. However, generic and tutoring-
specific parameters do produce useful models of stu-
dent learning in our system. Generic user affect pa-
rameters increase the usefulness of these models.

ITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialogue
system) (Litman et al., 2006) is a speech-enabled tu-
tor built on top of the text-based Why2-Atlas con-
ceptual physics tutor (VanLehn et al., 2002). In
ITSPOKE, a student first types an essay into a
web-based interface answering a qualitative physics
problem. ITSPOKE then analyzes the essay and en-
gages the student in spoken dialogue to correct mis-
conceptions and elicit more complete explanations.
Student speech is digitized from the microphone in-
put and sent to the Sphinx2 recognizer. Sphinx2’s
most probable “transcription” is then sent to Why2-
Atlas for syntactic, semantic and dialogue analy-
sis. Finally, the text response produced by Why2-
Atlas is converted to speech as described below, then
played in the student’s headphones and displayed on
the interface. After the dialogue, the student revises
the essay, thereby ending the tutoring or causing an-
other round of tutoring/essay revision.
For this study, we used 3 ITSPOKE corpora,
shown in Table 1.1 The SYN03 corpus was col-
lected in 2003 for an evaluation comparing learn-
ing in typed and spoken human and computer tu-
toring (Litman et al., 2006). ITSPOKE’s voice was
synthesized with the Cepstral text-to-speech system,
and its speech recognizer was trained from pilot IT-
SPOKE studies and Why2-Atlas evaluations. The
PR05 and SYN05 corpora were collected in 2005,
to evaluate the impact of tutor voice quality (Forbes-
Riley et al., 2006). For these 2 corpora, ITSPOKE
used an updated speech recognizer further trained
on the SYN03 corpus. For the SYN05 corpus, IT-
SPOKE used the synthesized tutor voice from the
SYN03 corpus; for the PR05 corpus, ITSPOKE
used a pre-recorded tutor voice from a paid voice
talent. Figure 1 gives an annotated (Section 3) PR05
excerpt (ASR shows what ITSPOKE heard).
The same experimental procedure was used to
collect all 3 ITSPOKE corpora: college students
who had taken no college physics: 1) read a
small document of background material, 2) took
a pretest measuring initial physics knowledge, 3)
work through a set of 5 problems (dialogues) with
ITSPOKE, 4) took a posttest similar to the pretest.
&apos;The user populations of the 2005 corpora and 2003 corpus
are different, due to variation in year and recruitment method.

Subjects in the PR05 and SYN05 corpora also
completed a survey probing user satisfaction after
taking the posttest (SYN03 corpus subjects did not).
Our survey, shown in Figure 2, is essentially the
same as the one used in the DARPA Communicator
multi-site evaluation (Walker et al., 2002). Although
tailored lexically for a tutoring system, these state-
ments are generally applicable to spoken dialogue
systems. Students rated their degree of agreement
with each statement on a scale of 1 to 5.

sive truck hit a patch of frictionless ice and have a head-on col-
lision. Upon which vehicle is the impact force greater? Which

3.1 Dialogue System-Generic Parameters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999795">
Prior PARADISE applications predicted user satis-
faction using a wide range of system-generic param-
eters, which include measures of speech recognition
quality (e.g. word error rate), measures of dialogue
communication and efficiency (e.g. total turns and
elapsed time), and measures of task completion (e.g.
a binary representation of whether the task was com-
pleted) (M¨oller, 2005a; M¨oller, 2005b; Walker et al.,
2002; Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2000; Walker et al.,
2000; Walker et al., 1997). In this prior work, each
dialogue between user and system represents a sin-
gle “task” (e.g., booking airline travel), thus these
measures are calculated on a per-dialogue basis.
In our work, the entire tutoring session represents
a single “task”, and every student in our corpora
completed this task. Thus we extract 13 system-
generic parameters on a per-student basis, i.e. over
the 5 dialogues for each user, yielding a single pa-
rameter value for each student in our 3 corpora.
First, we extracted 9 parameters representing dia-
logue communication and efficiency. Of these pa-
rameters, 7 were used in prior PARADISE appli-
cations: Time on Task, Total ITSPOKE Turns and
Words, Total User Turns and Words, Average IT-
SPOKE Words/Turn, and Average User Words/Turn.
Our 2 additional “communication-related” (M¨oller,
2005a) parameters measure system-user interactiv-
ity, but were not used in prior work (to our knowl-
edge): Ratio of User Words to ITSPOKE Words, Ra-
tio of User Turns to ITSPOKE Turns.
Second, we extracted 4 parameters representing
speech recognition quality, which have also been
used in prior work: Word Error Rate, Concept Ac-
curacy, Total Timeouts, Total Rejections2.

Although prior PARADISE applications tend to
use system-generic parameters, we hypothesize that
task-specific parameters may also prove useful for
predicting performance. We extract 12 tutoring-
specific parameters over the 5 dialogues for each stu-
dent, yielding a single parameter value per student,
for each student in our 3 corpora. Although these pa-
rameters are specific to our tutoring system, similar
parameters are available in other tutoring systems.

students’ turns with respect to the tutoring topic

(physics, in our case) may play a role in predicting
system performance. Each of our student turns is
automatically labeled with 1 of 3 “Correctness” la-
bels by the ITSPOKE semantic understanding com-
ponent: Correct, Incorrect, Partially Correct. La-
beled examples are shown in Figure 1. From these
3 Correctness labels, we derive 9 parameters: a To-
tal and a Percent for each label, and a Ratio of each
label to every other label (e.g. Correct/Incorrect).
Second, students write and then may modify their
physics essay at least once during each dialogue with
ITSPOKE. We thus hypothesize that like “Correct-
ness”, the total number of essays per student may
play a role in predicting system performance.
Finally, although student test scores before/after
using ITSPOKE will be used as our student learning
metric, we hypothesize that these scores may also
play a role in predicting user satisfaction.

3.3 User Affect Parameters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910565217391">
We hypothesize that user affect plays a role in pre-
dicting user satisfaction and student learning. Al-
though affect parameters have not been used in other
PARADISE studies (to our knowledge), they are
generic; for example, in various spoken dialogue
systems, user affect has been annotated and automat-
ically predicted from e.g., acoustic-prosodic and lex-
ical features (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004b; Lee
et al., 2002; Ang et al., 2002; Batliner et al., 2003).
As part of a larger investigation into emotion
adaptation, we are manually annotating the stu-
dent turns in our corpora for affective state. Cur-
rently, we are labeling 1 of 4 states of “Certain-
ness”: certain, uncertain, neutral, mixed (certain
and uncertain), and we are separately labeling 1
of 2 states of “Frustration/Anger”: frustrated/angry,
non-frustrated/angry. These affective states3 were
found in pilot studies to be most prevalent in our tu-
toring dialogues4, and are also of interest in other
dialogue research, e.g. tutoring (Bhatt et al., 2004;
Moore et al., 2004; Pon-Barry et al., 2004) and spo-
ken dialogue (Ang et al., 2002). Labeled examples

and all the turns of 17 students in our PR05 corpus.6
From these labels, we derived 25 User Affect pa-
rameters per student, over the 5 dialogues for that
student. First, for each Certainness label, we com-
puted a Total, a Percent, and a Ratio to each other la-
bel. We also computed a Total for each sequence of
identical Certainness labels (e.g. Certain:Certain),
hypothesizing that states maintained over multiple
turns may have more impact on performance than
single occurrences. Second, we computed the same
parameters for each Frustration/Anger label.

In this section, we first investigate the usefulness of
our system-generic and tutoring-specific parameters
for training models of user satisfaction and student
learning in our tutoring corpora with the PARADISE
framework. We use the SPSS statistical package
with a stepwise multivariate linear regression pro-
cedure7 to automatically determine parameter inclu-
sion in the model. We then investigate how well
these models generalize across different user-system
configurations, by testing the models in different
corpora and corpus subsets. Finally, we investigate
whether generic user affect parameters increase the

7At each step, the parameter with the highest partial correla-
tion with the target predicted variable, controlled for all previ-

8Researchers have also used average score (M¨oller, 2005b;

used (Walker et al., 1997). We tried these variations, and our

We trained a user satisfaction model on each cor-
pus, then tested it on the other corpus. In addition,
we split each corpus in half randomly, then trained
a user satisfaction model on each half, and tested
it on the other half. We hypothesized that despite
the decrease in the dataset size, models trained and
tested in the same corpus would have higher gen-
eralizability than models trained on one corpus and
tested on the other, due to the increased data homo-
geneity within each corpus, since each corpus used a
different ITSPOKE version. As predictors, we used
only the 13 system-generic and 12 tutoring-specific
parameters that were available for all subjects.
Results are shown in Table 2. The first and fourth
columns show the training and test data, respec-
tively. The second and fifth columns show the user
satisfaction variance accounted for by the trained
model in the training and test data, respectively. The
third column shows the parameters that were se-
lected as predictors of user satisfaction in the trained
model, ordered by degree of contribution9.
For example, as shown in the first row, the model
trained on the PR05 corpus uses Total Incorrect stu-
dent turns as the strongest predictor of user satis-
faction, followed by Total Essays; these parameters
are not highly correlated10. This model accounts for
27.4% of the user satisfaction variance in the PR05
corpus. When tested on the SYN05 corpus, it ac-
counts for 0.1% of the user satisfaction variance.
The low R2 values for both training and testing
in the first two rows show that neither corpus yields
9The ordering reflects the standardized coefficients (beta
weights), which are computed in SPSS based on scaling of
the input parameters, to enable an assessment of the predictive
power of each parameter relative to the others in a model.
10Hereafter, predictors in a model are not highly correlated
(R &gt; .70) unless noted. Linear regression does not assume that
predictors are independent, only that they are not highly corre-
lated. Because correlations above R =.70 can affect the coeffi-
cients, deletion of redundant predictors may be advisable.
a very powerful model of user satisfaction even in
the training corpus, and this model does not gener-
alize very well to the test corpus. As hypothesized,
training and testing in a single corpus yields higher
R2 values for testing, as shown in the last four rows,
although these models still account for less than a
quarter of the variance in the test data. The increased
R2 values for training here may indicate over-fitting.
Across all 6 experiments, there is almost no overlap
of parameters used to predict user satisfaction.
Overall, these results show that this method of
developing an ITSPOKE user satisfaction model
is very sensitive to changes in training data;
this was also found in other PARADISE applica-
tions (M¨oller, 2005b; Walker et al., 2000). Some
applications have also reported similarly low R2 val-
ues for testing both within a corpus (M¨oller, 2005b)
and also when a model trained on one system cor-
pus is tested on another system corpus (Walker et
al., 2000). However, most PARADISE applications
have yielded higher R2 values than ours for train-
ing (M¨oller, 2005b; Walker et al., 2002; Bonneau-
Maynard et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2000).
We hypothesize two reasons for why our exper-
iments did not yield more useful user satisfaction
models. First, in prior PARADISE applications,
users completed a survey after every dialogue with
the system. In our case, subjects completed only one
survey, at the end of the experiment (5 dialogues). It
may be that this “per-student” unit for user satisfac-
tion is too large to yield a very powerful model; i.e.,
this measure is not fine-grained enough. In addi-
tion, tutoring systems are not designed to maximize
user satisfaction, but rather, their design goal is to
maximize student learning. Moreover, prior tutor-
ing studies have shown that certain features corre-
lated with student learning do not have the same re-
lationship to user satisfaction (e.g. are not predictive

As in other tutoring research, e.g. (Chi et al., 2001;
Litman et al., 2006), we use posttest score (POST)
controlled for pretest score (PRE) as our target stu-
dent learning prediction metric, such that POST is
our target variable and PRE is always a parameter
in the final model, although it is not necessarily the
strongest predictor.11 In this way, we measure stu-
dent learning gains, not just final test score.
As shown in Table 1, all subjects in our 3 corpora
took the pretest and posttest. However, in order to
compare our student learning models with our user
satisfaction models, our first experiments predicting
student learning used the same training and testing
datasets that were used to predict user satisfaction in
Section 4.1 (i.e. we ran the same experiments except
we predicted POST controlled for PRE instead of
user satisfaction). Results are shown in the first 6
rows of Table 3.
As shown, these 6 models all account for more
than 50% of the POST variance in the training data.
Furthermore, most of them account for close to, or

and testing in one corpus would yield higher R2 val-

of these models had the highest R2 values for train-

and SYN05:half2), suggesting over-fitting.
Overall, these results show that this is an effec-
tive method of developing a prediction model of stu-
dent learning for ITSPOKE, and is less sensitive to
changes in training data than it was for user satis-
faction. Moreover, there is more overlap in these
6 models of parameters that are useful for predict-
ing student learning (besides PRE); “Correctness”
parameters and dialogue communication and effi-
ciency parameters appear to be most useful overall.
Our next 3 experiments investigated how our stu-
dent learning models are impacted by including our
third SYN03 corpus. Using the same 25 parame-
ters, we trained a learning model on each set of two
combined corpora, then tested it on the other corpus.
Results are shown in the last 3 rows of Table 3.
As shown, these models still account for close
to, or more than, 50% of the student learning vari-
ance in the training data.12 The model trained
on PR05+SYN03 accounts for the most student
learning variance in the test data, showing that the
training data that is most similar to the test data
will yield the highest generalizability. That is,
the combined PR05+SYN03 corpora contains sub-
jects drawn from the same subject pool (2005) as
the SYN05 test data, and also contains subjects
who interacted with the same tutor voice (synthe-
sized) as this test data. In contrast, the combined
PR05+SYN05 corpora did not overlap in user pop-
ulation with the SYN03 test data, and the combined
SYN05+SYN03 corpora did not share a tutor voice
with the PR05 test data. “Correctness” parameters

correlated in the SYN05+SYN03 model, showing redundancy.

<bodyText confidence="0.987450382352941">
Our final experiments investigated whether our 25
user affect parameters impacted the usefulness of
the student learning models. As shown in Table 1,
all 20 subjects in our SYN03 corpus were annotated
for user affect, and 17 subjects in our PR05 corpus
were annotated for user affect. We trained a model
of student learning on each of these datasets, then
tested it on the other dataset.13 As predictors, we
included our 25 user affect parameters along with
the 13 system-generic and 12 tutoring-specific inter-
action parameters. These results are shown in the
first two rows of Table 4. We also reran these ex-
periments without user affect parameters, to gauge
the impact of the user affect parameters. These re-
sults are shown in the last two rows of Table 4. We
hypothesized that user affect parameters would pro-
duce more useful models, because prior tutoring re-
search has shown correlations between user affect
and student learning (e.g. (Craig et al., 2004)).
As shown in the first two rows, user affect predic-
tors appear in both models where these parameters
were included. The models trained on SYN03 use
pretest score and Total Time on Task as predictors;
when affect parameters are included, “Neutral Cer-
tainness” is added as a predictor, which increases the
R2 values for both training and testing. However,
the two models trained on PR05:17 show no predic-
tor overlap (besides PRE). Moreover, the PR05:17
model that includes an affect predictor (Total Se-
quence of 2 Non-Frustrated/Angry turns) has the
highest training R2, but the lowest testing R2 value.
13As only 17 subjects have both user affect annotation and
user surveys, there is not enough data currently to train and test
a user satisfaction model including user affect parameters.

5 Conclusions and Current Directions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993502631579">
Prior work in the tutoring community has focused on
correlations of single features with learning; our re-
sults suggest that PARADISE is an effective method
of extending these analyses. For the dialogue com-
munity, our results suggest that as spoken dialogue
systems move into new applications not optimized
for user satisfaction, such as tutoring systems, other
measures of performance may be more relevant, and
generic user affect parameters may be useful.
Our experiments used many of the same system-
generic parameters as prior studies, and some of
these parameters predicted user satisfaction both in
our models and in prior studies’ models (e.g., sys-
tem words/turn (Walker et al., 2002)). Nonetheless,
overall our user satisfaction models were not very
powerful even for training, were sensitive to training
data changes, showed little predictor overlap, and
did not generalize well to test data. Our user sat-
isfaction metric may not be fine-grained enough; in
other PARADISE studies, users took a survey after
every dialogue with the system. In addition, tutoring
systems are not designed to maximize user satisfac-
tion; their goal is to maximize student learning.
Our student learning models were much more
powerful and less sensitive to changes in training
data. Our best models explained over 50% of the stu-
dent learning variance for training and testing, and
both student “Correctness” parameters and dialogue
communication and efficiency parameters were of-
ten useful predictors. User affect parameters further
improved the predictive power of one student learn-
ing model for both training and testing.
Once our user affect annotations are complete,
we can further investigate their use to predict stu-
dent learning and user satisfaction. Unlike our
other parameters, these annotations are not currently
available, although they can be predicted automati-
cally (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004b), in our sys-

tem. However, as in (Batliner et al., 2003), our prior
work suggests that linguistic features reflective of af-
fective states can replace affect annotation (Forbes-
Riley and Litman, 2005). In future work we will use
such features in our prediction models. Finally, we
are also annotating tutor and student dialogue acts
and automating the tutor act annotations; when com-
plete we can investigate their usefulness in our pre-
diction models; dialogue acts have also been used in
prior PARADISE applications (M¨oller, 2005a).

We represent performance with two metrics: user satisfaction and student learning. We train and test predictive models of these metrics in our tutoring system corpora. We predict user satisfaction with 2 parameter types: 1) system-generic, and 2) tutoringspecific. To predict student learning, we also use a third type: 3) user affect. Alhough generic parameters are useful predictors of user satisfaction in other PAR- ADISE applications, overall our parameters produce less useful user satisfaction models in our system.

In other types of spoken dialogue systems, the user’s subjective judgments about using the system are often considered a primary system performance metric; e.g., user satisfaction has been measured via surveys which ask users to rate systems during use along dimensions such as task ease, speech input/output quality, user expectations and expertise, and user future use (M¨oller, 2005b; Walker et al., 2002; Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2000; Shriberg et al., 1992). However, it is expensive to run experiments over large numbers of users to obtain reliable system performance measures. The PARADISE model (Walker et al., 1997) proposes instead to predict system performance, using parameters representing interaction costs and benefits between system and user, including task success, dialogue efficiency, and dialogue quality. More formally, a set of interaction parameters are measured in a spoken dialogue system corpus, then used in a multivariate linear regression to predict the target performance variable.

In this prior work, each dialogue between user and system represents a single “task” (e.g., booking airline travel), thus these measures are calculated on a per-dialogue basis. In our work, the entire tutoring session represents a single “task”, and every student in our corpora completed this task. Thus we extract 13 systemgeneric parameters on a per-student basis, i.e. over the 5 dialogues for each user, yielding a single parameter value for each student in our 3 corpora.

These results are shown in the first two rows of Table 4. We also reran these experiments without user affect parameters, to gauge the impact of the user affect parameters. These results are shown in the last two rows of Table 4. We hypothesized that user affect parameters would produce more useful models, because prior tutoring research has shown correlations between user affect and student learning (e.g. (Craig et al., 2004)). As shown in the first two rows, user affect predictors appear in both models where these parameters were included. The models trained on SYN03 use pretest score and Total Time on Task as predictors; when affect parameters are included, “Neutral Certainness” is added as a predictor, which increases the R2 values for both training and testing. However, the two models trained on PR05:17 show no predictor overlap (besides PRE). Moreover, the PR05:17 model that includes an affect predictor (Total Sequence of 2 Non-Frustrated/Angry turns) has the highest training R2, but the lowest testing R2 val</context>

To predict student learning, we also use a third type of parameter: 3) manually annotated user affect. Although prior PARADISE applications have tended to use system-generic parameters, we hypothesize that task-specific and user affect parameters may also prove useful. We emphasize that user affect parameters are still system-generic; user affect has been annotated and/or automatically predicted in other types of spoken dialogue systems, e.g. as in (Lee et al., 2002; Ang et al., 2002; Batliner et al., 2003). Our results show that, although generic parameters were useful predictors of user satisfaction in other PARADISE applications, overall our parameters produce less useful user satisfaction models in our tutoring system. However, generic and tutoringspecific parameters do produce useful models of student learning in our system. Generic user affect parameters increase the usefulness of these models. 2 Spoken Dialogue Tutoring Corpora ITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialogue system) (Litman et al., 2006) is a speech-enabled tutor built on top of the</context>

Although affect parameters have not been used in other PARADISE studies (to our knowledge), they are generic; for example, in various spoken dialogue systems, user affect has been annotated and automatically predicted from e.g., acoustic-prosodic and lexical features (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004b; Lee et al., 2002; Ang et al., 2002; Batliner et al., 2003). As part of a larger investigation into emotion adaptation, we are manually annotating the student turns in our corpora for affective state. Currently, we are labeling 1 of 4 states of “Certainness”: certain, uncertain, neutral, mixed (certain and uncertain), and we are separately labeling 1 of 2 states of “Frustration/Anger”: frustrated/angry, non-frustrated/angry.

User affect parameters further improved the predictive power of one student learning model for both training and testing. Once our user affect annotations are complete, we can further investigate their use to predict student learning and user satisfaction. Unlike our other parameters, these annotations are not currently available, although they can be predicted automatically (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004b), in our sys270 tem. However, as in (Batliner et al., 2003), our prior work suggests that linguistic features reflective of affective states can replace affect annotation (ForbesRiley and Litman, 2005). In future work we will use such features in our prediction models. Finally, we are also annotating tutor and student dialogue acts and automating the tutor act annotations; when complete we can investigate their usefulness in our prediction models; dialogue acts have also been used in prior PARADISE applications (M¨oller, 2005a).

In this prior work, each dialogue between user and system represents a single “task” (e.g., booking airline travel), thus these measures are calculated on a per-dialogue basis. In our work, the entire tutoring session represents a single “task”, and every student in our corpora completed this task. Thus we extract 13 systemgeneric parameters on a per-student basis, i.e. over the 5 dialogues for each user, yielding a single parameter value for each student in our 3 corpora.

The increased R2 values for training here may indicate over-fitting. Across all 6 experiments, there is almost no overlap of parameters used to predict user satisfaction. Overall, these results show that this method of developing an ITSPOKE user satisfaction model is very sensitive to changes in training data; this was also found in other PARADISE applications (M¨oller, 2005b; Walker et al., 2000). Some applications have also reported similarly low R2 values for testing both within a corpus (M¨oller, 2005b) and also when a model trained on one system corpus is tested on another system corpus (Walker et al., 2000).

Student learning is a primary metric for evaluating the performance of these systems; it can be measured, e.g., by comparing student pretests taken prior to system use with posttests taken after system use. In other types of spoken dialogue systems, the user’s subjective judgments about using the system are often considered a primary system performance metric; e.g., user satisfaction has been measured via surveys which ask users to rate systems during use along dimensions such as task ease, speech input/output quality, user expectations and expertise, and user future use (M¨oller, 2005b; Walker et al., 2002; Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2000; Shriberg et al., 1992). However, it is expensive to run experiments over large numbers of users to obtain reliable system performance measures. The PARADISE model (Walker et al., 1997) proposes instead to predict system performance, using parameters representing interaction costs and benefits between system and user, including task success, dialogue efficiency, and dialogue quality. More formally, a set of interaction parameters are measured in a spoken dialogue system corpus, then used in a multivariate linear regression to predict the targ</context>

Our survey, shown in Figure 2, is essentially the same as the one used in the DARPA Communicator multi-site evaluation (Walker et al., 2002).

First, in prior PARADISE applications, users completed a survey after every dialogue with the system. In our case, subjects completed only one survey, at the end of the experiment (5 dialogues). It may be that this “per-student” unit for user satisfaction is too large to yield a very powerful model; i.e., this measure is not fine-grained enough.

For the dialogue community, our results suggest that as spoken dialogue systems move into new applications not optimized for user satisfaction, such as tutoring systems, other measures of performance may be more relevant, and generic user affect parameters may be useful. Our experiments used many of the same systemgeneric parameters as prior studies, and some of these parameters predicted user satisfaction both in our models and in prior studies’ models (e.g., system words/turn (Walker et al., 2002)). Nonetheless, overall our user satisfaction models were not very powerful even for training, were sensitive to training data changes, showed little predictor overlap, and did not generalize well to test data. Our user satisfaction metric may not be fine-grained enough; in other PARADISE studies, users took a survey after every dialogue with the system. In addition, tutoring systems are not designed to maximize user satisfaction; their goal is to maximize student learning. Our student learning models were much more powerful and less sensitive to changes in training data. Our best models expla</context>
