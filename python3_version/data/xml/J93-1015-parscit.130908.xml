It&apos;s taken a good three years to squeeze this collection of workshop papers through
the publishing pipeline. No great matter: the state of the art in lexical acquisition is
still much as it was. Editor Zernik has used the time to impose some coherence on the
multi-disciplinary material by adding a substantial introduction, and at least some of
the authors have cross-referenced their papers to other contributions. The effort has
succeeded up to a point. But, as with most such proceedings, it is still up to the reader
to fit the bits and pieces into a common frame of reference.
The papers are as follows:

(In what follows, figures in parentheses refer to the above list.)
How can we use on-line sources to provide NLP systems with lexical data in at
least a semi-automatic fashion? The question is a pressing one, because &amp;quot;the Lexicon
has emerged as the major natural language processing bottleneck&amp;quot; (1). Most existing
systems stall at unknown words. Even when a word is known, there is no guarantee
that the current sense of that word is known, or that its context does not constitute
an unknown idiom or compound, or that other data in the lexicon are adequate. Gen-
eration in particular requires extensive knowledge of &amp;quot;idiosyncratic&amp;quot; (7) collocations
(e.g., strong tea or powerful car), which do not fit into the conventional linear concep-
tion of a lexicon. Moreover, &amp;quot;understanding NL requires vast amounts of background
knowledge&amp;quot; (14). How that knowledge should be represented and keyed to lexicon
entries is still an open question.
There is, of course, broad consensus about some of the basic stuff that should
go into the lexicon, starting with word class. Atkins and Levin (10) offer a shortlist
for verbs: for each sense, the lexicon should contain semantic class, aktionsart, and
arguments; selectional restrictions on arguments; subcategorization; morphologically
related words; related extended uses; related idiomatic uses; collocates; domain labels;
pragmatic force; corpus citations exemplifying each feature; plus, of course, phonology
and morphology.
Other papers extend or refine this list. Relative frequencies of word senses and
collocates are needed (3, 14), for example, if lexical choices in natural language output
are to appear &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; (6). But of course, there is no absolute criterion for splitting
an entry into &amp;quot;word senses&amp;quot; in the first place (5, 10). And collocations need to be
stored as annotated grammatical structures (1) if productive use is to be made of them
(5th grade â€”&gt; 6th grade(r), etc). Synonyms and antonyms should also be accessible (14),
as well as IS-A links and other types of semantic cross-reference as represented in
Princeton&apos;s WordNet system (9). Calzolari (8) sees in the addition of such links the
basic difference between a lexical database and a lexical knowledge base. For repre-
senting meaning, Dorr (11) requires Schankesque conceptual structures, while Dyer
(12) proposes context-based statistical associations. These two approaches reflect Ve-
lardi&apos;s (13) distinction (following Leech) between conceptual meaning and collocative
meaning. Both may be needed.
Now to the crux: How can we automate the acquisition of all these data? Most
contributors consider one of two possible on-line sources: machine-readable dictio-
naries (MRDs) or text corpora. While a few types of data can be usefully extracted
from MRDs (8, 9), e.g., word senses for the purposes of information retrieval or topic
identification (3, 4), most cannot be. And merging data from different MRDs is highly
problematic (10). Collocations (1, 6, 7), subcategorization (8), and any semantic knowl-
edge beyond basic semantic features (14) are more readily obtainable from corpora
(13), and some useful tools are described (5, 6, 7). In either case, the consensus is that
human intervention or post-editing is inevitable (2, 6, 13). On-line texts also require
linguistic pre-processing (1, 6) before useful data can be extracted, but given the limi-
tations of state-of-the-art analyzers (1), quick-and-dirty methods are preferred (6, 13).
However, MRDs and corpora are not the only resources at hand. As Jacobs (2)
is at pains to emphasize, the input text itself is a vital knowledge source that most
NLP systems largely ignore. Exploiting this source implies a dynamic type of lexicon in
which word senses are adapted or created during the processing of the input text. This
approach, which represents a minority interest in this volume (12, 15), ties in well with
the editor&apos;s main conclusion (1) that &amp;quot;systems must expressedly deal with lexical gaps
as part of their normal operational mode. Satisfying this requirement entails a new
lexical organizational principle, one that allows generalization, reasoning by analogy,

and lateral indexing.&amp;quot; Martin (15) has defined explicit abstract structures with which
metaphorical analogy can take place. Dyer (12) has implemented a connectionist model
of &amp;quot;symbol recirculation&amp;quot; in which &amp;quot;words with similar semantics (as defined by word
usage) end up forming similar distributed representations in the lexicon.&amp;quot; Script-type
word associations are acquired in similar fashion. Much of Dyer&apos;s argument finds
echoes in my corpus-based approach to semantics (Sadler 1989).
NLP systems should be able to acquire knowledge of previously unknown words
or usages from the (con)texts in which they are found. Thus, beside analogical capac-
ities, systems need the ability to integrate the conclusions reached by analogy into
their lexicon. Without such learning abilities there would appear to be no way out
of the vicious circle: lexical acquisition depends on linguistic pre-processing of text,
but effective pre-processing requires a comprehensive lexicon. And without a dynamic
view of the lexicon, it is difficult to envision any efficient means of customizing it to
different domains.
This book certainly provides a useful overview of the field, and there are some
valuable pointers to the way ahead. There is a good deal of overlap (one paper has
a half-page quote from another in the same volume), and relevance might have been
improved by a tighter definition of the workshop&apos;s topic. To my mind there is one
striking omission, and that is the enormous importance of bilingual sources. There
is a passing reference to bilingual MRDs (10), but no mention whatever of bilingual
corpora, in spite of the ongoing work at IBM (e.g., Dagan, Itai, and Schwal11991; Brown
et al. 1991) and BSO&apos;s Bilingual Knowledge Bank design (Sadler 1989). Many of the
problems connected with recognition of word class and senses, idioms, and metaphors
in text can be substantially resolved if such units are mapped onto equivalents in a
different language.
Finally, one mean little grouse. Is it because computational linguists have so little
faith in their own products that no one ran a spelling checker on this book?
