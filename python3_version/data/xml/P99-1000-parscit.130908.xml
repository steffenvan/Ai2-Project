PREFACE

<bodyText confidence="0.995307608695652">
This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the 37th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics, held at the University of Maryland from 20th to 26th June 1999.
As co-chairs, we had two particular objectives for the program this year. First, we wanted to acknowledge the
increasing worldwide interest in computational linguistics, and mirror the move towards true internationalism
that is underway within the ACL itself. Second, we wanted to reflect the broader connections that computational
linguistics has with other research communities by increasing the scope of the material covered. You will see the
results of our pursual of these objectives throughout the program and its organisation: the 80 papers collected
here for presentation were drawn from over 320 received, with the authors representing 29 countries and the
reviewers drawn from 25 countries.
The larger-than-usual size of the conference this year is at least in part due to our incorporation of community-
proposed theme sessions. In an iteration prior to the call for papers itself, we issued a call for theme session
proposals. This was our attempt to break with the somewhat traditional set of paper topic categories that one
tends to think of at ACL conferences. As a way of highlighting real areas of topical interest in the community, we
think the experiment worked extremely well, despite the inevitable hiccups that accompany the introduction of
any new idea. But you can be the judge of this: the ACL executive committee and next year&apos;s program chairs will
be interested to hear what you think of this innovation.
Selecting the papers we could fit into the program from the high number of submissions received was not an easy
task. In total over 200 reviewers were involved in the reviewing process, reporting through a thematic session
committee with 12 members and a final program committee of six persons. Without the help of all these people,
managing the large number of papers submitted would simply not have been feasible. All those who contributed
are named on the following pages, but we would like in particular here to express our thanks to Stephen Abney
(AT&amp;T Labs — Research) and Graeme Ritchie (University of Edinburgh, UK), who helped in reviewing the theme
proposals at extremely short notice, and the members of the program committee: Nicoletta Calzolari (Istituto di
Linguistica Computazionale del CNR, Italy); Barbara Di Eugenio (University of Illinois at Chicago, USA); Hwee
Tou Ng (DSO National Laboratories, Singapore); Cecile Paris (CSIRO Sydney, Australia); Keh-Yih Su (Behavior
Design Corporation, Taiwan); and K. Vijay-Shanker (University of Delaware, USA). The program committee spent
two intensive days at a meeting in New Jersey reaching the final decisions, enduring a snowstorm in the process.
There are, of course, a great many other people without whom this event would not be possible. We extend a
special thanks to our invited speakers, Marti Hearst, Sadaoki Furui and George Miller, all of whom offer varying
perspectives on computational linguistics and its links to other areas of endeavour. We are indebted to a number
of individuals for taking care of specific parts of the conference program: Susan Armstrong (ISSCO, Switzerland)
put together a rich workshops program; Melanie Baljko (University of Toronto, Canada) and Anna Korhonen
(University of Cambridge, UK) chaired the student session committee; and Richard Sproat (AT&amp;T Labs, USA)
organised the excellent tutorial program. Maria Milosavljevic (CSIRO Sydney, Australia) built and maintained the
main ACL99 web site, which served as our principal information channel.
On the ground at the University of Maryland, Bonnie Dorr managed the local arrangements, assisted by Cecilia
Kullman, Edna Walker, Amy Weinberg, Gina Levow and Philip Resnik; David Traum arranged the demonstration
sessions, and John White was responsible for sponsorship organisation. They have worked hard to provide you
with what promises to be a very enjoyable conference experience.
Throughout the last year, we as co-chairs have constantly relied on the experience and help of both Kathy McCoy,
ACL Secretary-Treasurer, and Priscilla Rasmussen, ACL Business Manager; the ACL Executive Committee provided
useful advice especially in the early stages. At the end of the day, however, our greatest debt is to those who
provided us with administrative support at our two host organisations: Joanne Avery and Cheryl Bock at AT&amp;T
and Debbie Whittington at Macquarie University&apos;s Language Technology Group. Their always speedy response to
our last-minute requests for assistance made all the difference.

PREFACE TO THE STUDENT SESSION PAPERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999633">
The proceedings of ACL&apos;99 wouldn&apos;t be complete without the extended abstracts of the students presenting their
work in the special student sessions. Unlike the regular papers presented in the main session, students were
encouraged to present work in progress that includes great ideas for future research.
We received 30 submissions from 12 countries. After thorough consideration, we accepted 10 of the submitted
papers. Each submission was reviewed by at least two student reviewers and one non-student reviewer.
We want to thank the 31 members of the program committee for being precise and fair in their assessments and
for making our lives easier by returning all reviews on time.
The student members of the ACL 1999 Student Session Program Committee were:

As co-chairs, we had two particular objectives for the program this year. First, we wanted to acknowledge the</note>
<abstract confidence="0.9526616">increasing worldwide interest in computational linguistics, and mirror the move towards true internationalism that is underway within the ACL itself. Second, we wanted to reflect the broader connections that computational linguistics has with other research communities by increasing the scope of the material covered. You will see the results of our pursual of these objectives throughout the program and its organisation: the 80 papers collected here for presentation were drawn from over 320 received, with the authors representing 29 countries and the reviewers drawn from 25 countries. The larger-than-usual size of the conference this year is at least in part due to our incorporation of communityproposed theme sessions. In an iteration prior to the call for papers itself, we issued a call for theme session proposals. This was our attempt to break with the somewhat traditional set of paper topic categories that one tends to think of at ACL conferences. As a way of highlighting real areas of topical interest in the community, we</abstract>
