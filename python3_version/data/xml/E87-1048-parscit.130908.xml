ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999778555555556">
The topic of the paper is the problem
how to define case relations by semantic
predicates. A general principle is out-
lined, which renders it possible to
&amp;quot;calculate&amp;quot; case relations for a given
representation of a (verb-)sememe by
means of expressions. This principle is
based on an assignment of case relations
to primitive predicates and modification
rules for nested expressions. Contrary
to the traditional case grammar it turns
out that one needs mixed case relations,
especially for two reasons: Arguments
occur at &amp;quot;too different&amp;quot; places in an
expression or arguments Lave combined
case relations. The consequence is that
case relations don&apos;t form a set of iso-
lated elements but a structured system.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.974047388059702">
The paper is not intended for defending
case relations in general. I want to
sketch only some problems connected with
the definition of case relations and will
demonstrate consequences, which seem
partly a cit &amp;quot;unconventional&amp;quot;.
I will not enter into the terminolo-
gical discussion on deep cases, case
relations etc. and subsume all these
variants under the label &amp;quot;case relation&amp;quot;.
This is justified by the obvious fact
that there are more proposals and systems
than authors. So one will not overcome
this chaos by neat terminological distinc-
tions. It is rather typical for publica-
tions on deep cases that proposals are
presented without sufficient motivation
or justification (e. g. Nilsen 1973).
It has turned out that in the matter
of case relations as a field of linguis-
tic and fundamental research intuition
and language competence cannot show the
right way how to solve the problems of
defining them. This is my first conclu-
sion from the general scene. Without
doubt it is inevitable to work out some
principles on the basis of which case
relations may be defined. This would
enable us
- to discuss a rather &amp;quot;clear&amp;quot; object
(some principles instead of tens (or
hundreds) of proposals),
- to evaluate and compare existing pro-
posals,
- to connect case relations with other
essential notions.
Quite another question is &amp;quot;What are case
relations good for?&amp;quot;. One cannot ignore
the fact that a lot of serious objections
against case relations have been advanced,
covering a whole range from &amp;quot;they are
redundant&amp;quot; till &amp;quot;the swamp of lacking
plausible (or even formal) definitions&amp;quot;
resulting in the conclusion that case
relations are useless especially for
computational linguistics (Mellema 1974,
Luckhardt 1985). On the other hand many -
authors are advocates pro case relations,
even in MT (e. g. Nagao 1986, Somers
1986). Here the character of case rela-
tions as a link (or pivot) is stressed -
between surface and deep level or between
languages. For such situations one can
Acept the use of case relations without
exact definitions having an experimental
system as a touchstone.
Case relations are considered here as
names or labels of arguments in semantic
predicates used for the description of
(verb-)sememes. This is only one side of
the coin! The second important aspect are
the means by which deep cases are ex-
pressed at the surface (grammatical cases,
prepositions, linear order, ...). They
have to be taken into account as well,
and only both aspects together will yield
an adequate picture.

2. Case relations and semantic predicates
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.958236888888889">
One possibility to grasp the whole
problem seems to be the definition of
case relations on the basis of semantic
predicates. Sememes (of verb-lexemes) are
represented by expressions containing
primitive semantic predicates. The fol-
lowing expression may be assigned to a
verb like &amp;quot;to convey&amp;quot;: (a conveys b from
c to d)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8737765">
(1) MOVE-ACTION(a,b,c,d)
.ACAUSE(a,CHANGE-POSITION(b,c,d))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.419289">
(cf. Allen 1984). I will not discuss the
question whether ACAUSE (= &amp;quot;agent caus-
ation&amp;quot;) and CHANGE-POSITION are indeed
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99375">

<bodyText confidence="0.937640842105263">
primitive predicates. I consider them
here as that. Furthermore one may discuss
whether (5) sufficiently describes the
meaning of &amp;quot;to convey&amp;quot;.
The idea of extracting case relations
from representations like (1) can be
bases on the following principles:
(A) For each primitive predicate P there
is an assignment of exactly one case
relation to every argument placei:
zi(P) = ri (i-th argument of P has
case relation ri)
(B) There are modification rules for case
relations which render it possible to
&amp;quot;calculate&amp;quot; the case relations for
nested exnressions.
(A) means e. g. that for a primitive pre-
dicate like CHANGE-POSITION w know the
case relations of the argument places b,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.836199777777778">
c and d:
(2) zi(CHANGE-POSITION) = ri for 1 1 i 1 3
In this sense one can state without doubt
(3) zi(ACAUSE) = agent
(4) z3(CHANGE-POSITION) = goal
(B) may be interpreted in the following
way: If we know
- MOVE-ACTION has the form given in (1),
- the value of z2(ACAUSE),
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.943745666666667">
- second place of ACAUSE is filled in by
GRANGE-POSITION,
- the value of z1(CHANGE-POSITION),
then we know
- the value of z2(MOVE-ACTION), i. e. the
case relation of b in the whole expres-
sion (1).
Formally this may be expressed by a
four-place &amp;quot;modification mapping&amp;quot; m:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.847145">
(5) z2(MOVE-ACTION) =
mcACAUSE, z2(ACAUSE), GRANGE-POSITION,
z1 (CHANGE-POSITION))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995801875">
One may speculate whether all four argu-
ments are indeed necessary, they are
surely not. A similar idea is presented
in Thiel 1982 (p. 84 ff.), where the
mechanism of modification is applied,
too.
A general scheme for (B) is the
following: Assume one has
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.498194">
(6) q(...,x,...)
=R(..., S(...,x,...),...)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999088285714286">
where x is the j-th argument in Q,
S(...) the k-th argument in R and x the
l-th argument in S. Then zj(Q) is a
function of R, zk(R), S and zi(S).
proposal, namely zi(Q) = m(R, zl(S)),
would cause some difficulties, if R is a
many place predicate and there are in R
arguments S&apos; and S&amp;quot; with z1u (S1)=z1m(S&amp;quot;)
(cf. the FEED-example below). Thiel him-
self excludes this case explicitely.
The principles (A) and (B) form a re-
cursive scheme: (A) provides the results
for certain predicates, (B) renders it
possible to determine the results for
(verb-)sememes in general.
At any rate one would get a nice for-
malism for calculating case frames if (A)
and (B) are fulfilled. Unfortunately,
there are some additional problems I will
deal with below. But at first I take an
example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.773272875">
(7) SET(a,b,c)
= ACAUSE(a,BECOME(SIT(b,c)))
(8) z2(SIT) = locative
By a simplification of the general
scheme (four-place function m as in (5))
to the special variant one would obtain
for (7-8):
(9) z3(SET)
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.844037">
m(ACAUSE,mcBECOME,locative))
= m(ACAUSE,directive) = directive
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.980524428571429">
There are arguments for the assumption
that BECOME (and not ACAUSE) modifies
locative to directive (or goal): The
description of &amp;quot;to get to a place&amp;quot;
contains the expression
(10) BECOME(BE(b,c)) (as in (7))
Here one has the same modification of
locative to directive. This is in ac-
cordance with Thiel 1982.
Instead of (7) one could take another
expression, e. g. by using the predicate
ECAUSE (event causation) with the inter-
pretation that &amp;quot;an activity of a causes
BECOME(STT(b,c))&amp;quot;:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.385402">
(11) SET(a,b,c)
= ECAUSE(ACT(a), BECOME(SIT(b,c)))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997129">
Here the application of (A) and (B) is
not quite the same, one has here instead
of
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9650476">
(12) z1(SET) = zi(ACAUSE) for (7)
a modification
(13) z1(SET) = m(ECAUSE,z,(ACT))
m(ECAUSE,agentiv)
= &amp;quot;causator&amp;quot; ?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.914297">
These simple examples illustrate some
connections between the formal defini- â€¢
tion of case relations and semantic
predicates.
3. Expected complications
Now T turn so some unpleasant ques-
tions that depress a bit the hope in
this elegant s31ution. But they are
disagreeable only if one

<bodyText confidence="0.999208625">
- maintains the principle &amp;quot;one instance
per simple clause&amp;quot; for case relations
(cf. Fillmore 1968, Starosta 1981) and
- considers case relations as a rather
small set without internal structure.,
For a verb like &amp;quot;to swim&amp;quot; in a sentence.
like &amp;quot;a swims from b to c&amp;quot; it is reasona-
ble to assume a representation
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.56475975">
(14) SWIM(a) CHANGE-POSITION(a,b,c)
What to do if in this example (or another
of the same type) one detects that
(15) z1(SWIM) * zi(CHANGE-POSITION)?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9598605">
Secondly, one needs new rules for handling
an example like
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.796491">
(16) ASCERTAIN(a,b)
ACAUSE(a,BECOME(KNOVi(a,b)))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.977830243243244">
where a appears twice and at two rather
different places. One surely cannot assume
that z1(ACAUSE) is the same relation as
(17) m(ACAUSE,m(BECOME,zi(KNOW)))
if one makes the same simplification as
for (7). Another question appears in
(18) FEED(a,b,c) = ACAUSE(a,EAT(b,c))
This time one has two agents (a and b).
The next question is due to reflexive
verbs. If we take German examples, we
have e. g.
(19) Er wascht sich * Er wasent ihn
as in English, too (himself * him). Here
the case relation of &amp;quot;Er&amp;quot; should be a
mixture between agent and something like
experiencer or patiens (cf. Thiel 1982,
p. 104 f.). The second components may
not be left out because of the reflexive
verbs proper in German as &amp;quot;sich furchten&amp;quot;
(to be afraid, &amp;quot;sich schamen&amp;quot; (to be
ashamed). Here the appropriate case rela-
tion is not agent: A &amp;quot;semantic paraphrase&amp;quot;
for these verbs is &amp;quot;Etwas macht mich
fUrchten&amp;quot; (Something makes me afraid)
etc. In my opinion there is no sharp
boundary between the two types of re-
flexive verbs: Such a critical case is
e. g. &amp;quot;sich aufregen&amp;quot; (to get excited).
The fifth question is connected with
&amp;quot;plastered up&amp;quot; case relations. It does
not make sense to discuss whether one has
in (20) either the case relation instru-
mental or locative (cf. Thiel 1982,
p. 104 f.):
(20) I warmed the foot on the stove.
The same applies for temporal and causal
relations in other examples.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.593426">
4. Some conclusions
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97437764516129">
From the questions and lacking answers
one may draw some conclusions:
I. If one defines case relations by
means of semantic predicates as ex-
plained above, one needs in addition at
least one of these two things:
- a two-place relation &amp;quot; &amp;quot; within the
set of case relations in order to com-
pare them according to their &amp;quot;speci-
ficness&amp;quot;: For certain pairs of case
relations r1,r2 one has then &amp;quot;r1 r2&amp;quot;
with the meaning &amp;quot;r1 is equal to or
more specific than r,&amp;quot; (cf. the SWIM
example). In this sehse one may say
that e. g. objective is &amp;quot;the semantical
most neutral case&amp;quot; (Cook 1971), i. e.
one could establish case relations that
are more specific than the case rela-
tion objective.
- a two-place operation &amp;quot; e &amp;quot; for mixing
case relations: For certain pairs of
case relations ri,r2 there is a case
relation r with t = ri e r2 (cf. the
example (20)).
So the set of all case relations becomes
a structured system: Every case relation
stands no longer for itself alone.
II. One cannot derive case relations from
semantic predicates without presupposing
a synonymy relation between sememes: If
one assumes that the two sentences
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9334652">
(21) John sells Jim a car.
(22) Jim buys a car from John.
are synonymous, i. e.
(23) SELL(a,b,c) and
(24) BUY(b,a,c)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.96979524137931">
have the same representation, then the
case relations have to be the same:
(25) z1(S1-11-J0 - z2(BUY)
z(SELL) = z1(BUY)
If one admits that (21)
synonymous one Ilia have
relations.
This aspect is in a sense inde-
pendent of the approach proposed here:
The same question may be put without
reference to semantic predicates. One
needs such a synonymy relation at any
rate for case relations. Obviously the
different intuitive use of the synonymy
is one reason for the rather chaotic
situation.
III. A discussion of (23-24) and (18)
shows furthermore that a relation or
operatfon mentioned in T. provides the
means for a distinction of different
agents as John and Jim in (21-22) or
the two agents in (18): In the latter
case b is an &amp;quot;influenced agent&amp;quot;. This
has to be expressed precisely by the
modification rules.
(of a)
(of b)
and (22) are not
different case.

Sememes (of verb-lexemes) are represented by expressions containing primitive semantic predicates. The following expression may be assigned to a verb like &amp;quot;to convey&amp;quot;: (a conveys b from c to d) (1) MOVE-ACTION(a,b,c,d) .ACAUSE(a,CHANGE-POSITION(b,c,d)) (cf. Allen 1984). I will not discuss the question whether ACAUSE (= &amp;quot;agent causation&amp;quot;) and CHANGE-POSITION are indeed 302 primitive predicates. I consider them here as that. Furthermore one may discuss whether (5) sufficiently describes the meaning of &amp;quot;to convey&amp;quot;. The idea of extracting case relations from representations like (1) can be bases on the following principles: (A) For each primitive predicate P there is an assignment of exactly one case relation to every argument placei: zi(P) = ri (i-th argument of P has ri) (B) There are modification rules for case relations which render it possible to &amp;quot;calculate&amp;quot; the case relations for nested exnressions.

Formally this may be expressed by a &amp;quot;modification mapping&amp;quot; (5) z2(MOVE-ACTION) = mcACAUSE, z2(ACAUSE), GRANGE-POSITION, (CHANGE-POSITION)) One may speculate whether all four arguments are indeed necessary, they are surely not. A similar idea is presented in Thiel 1982 (p. 84 ff.), where the mechanism of modification is applied, too. general scheme for the following: Assume one has (6) q(...,x,...) =R(..., S(...,x,...),...) where x is the j-th argument in Q, S(...) the k-th argument in R and x the l-th argument in S. Then zj(Q) is a function of R, zk(R), S and zi(S). proposal, namely zi(Q) = m(R, zl(S)), would cause some difficulties, if R is a many place predicate and there are in R S&apos; and S&amp;quot; with (cf. the FEED-example below). Thiel himself excludes this case explicitely. The principles (A) and (B) form a recursive scheme: (A) provides the results for certain predicates, (B) renders it possible to determine the results for (verb-)sememes in general. At any rate one would get a nice formalism for calculating case frames if (A) and (B) are fulfilled. Unfortunately, there are some additional problems I will deal with below. But at first I take an example: (7) SET(a,b,c) = ACAUSE(a,BECOME(SIT(b,c))) (8) z2(SIT) = locative By a simplification of the general scheme (four-place function m as in (5)) to the special variant one would obtain for (7-8): (9) m(ACAUSE,mcBECOME,locative)) = m(ACAUSE,directive) = directive There are arguments for the assumption that BECOME (and not ACAUSE) modifies locative to directive (or goal): The description of &amp;quot;to get to a place&amp;quot; contains the expression (10) BECOME(BE(b,c)) (as in (7)) Here one has the same modification of locative to directive. This is in accordance with Thiel 1982. Instead of (7) one could take another expression, e. g. by using the predicate ECAUSE (event causation) with the interpretation that &amp;quot;an activity of a causes BECOME(STT(b,c))&amp;quot;: (11) SET(a,b,c) = ECAUSE(ACT(a), BECOME(SIT(b,c))) Here the application of (A) and (B) is not quite the same, one has here instead of (12) = for (7) a modification (13) = m(ECAUSE,z,(ACT)) m(ECAUSE,agentiv) = &amp;quot;causator&amp;quot; ?

Here the appropriate case relation is not agent: A &amp;quot;semantic paraphrase&amp;quot; for these verbs is &amp;quot;Etwas macht mich fUrchten&amp;quot; (Something makes me afraid) etc. In my opinion there is no sharp boundary between the two types of reflexive verbs: Such a critical case is e. g. &amp;quot;sich aufregen&amp;quot; (to get excited). The fifth question is connected with &amp;quot;plastered up&amp;quot; case relations. It does not make sense to discuss whether one has in (20) either the case relation instrumental or locative (cf. Thiel 1982, p. 104 f.): (20) I warmed the foot on the stove. The same applies for temporal and causal relations in other examples. 4. Some conclusions From the questions and lacking answers one may draw some conclusions: I. If one defines case relations by means of semantic predicates as explained above, one needs in addition at least one of these two things: a two-place relation &amp;quot; &amp;quot; within the set of case relations in order to compare them according to their &amp;quot;specificness&amp;quot;: For certain pairs of case r1,r2 one has then with the meaning &amp;quot;r1 is equal to or more specific than r,&amp;quot; (cf. the SWIM example). In this sehse one may say that e. g. objective is &amp;quot;the semantical most neutral case&amp;quot; (Cook 1971), i. e. one could establish case relations that are more specific than the case relation objective. a two-place operation &amp;quot; &amp;quot; mixing case relations: For certain pairs of relations there is a case r with t = e (cf. the example (20)). So the set of all case relations becomes a structured system: Every case relation stands no longer for itself alone. II. One cannot derive case relations from semantic predicates without presupposing a synonymy relation between sememes: If one assumes that the two sentences (21) John sells Jim a car. (22) Jim buys a car from John. are synonymous, i. e. (23) SELL(a,b,c) and (24) BUY(b,a,c) have the same representation, then the case relations have to be the same: (25) - = If one admits that (21) one relations. This aspect is in a sense independent of the approach proposed here: The same question may be put without reference to semantic predicates. One needs such a synonymy relation at any rate for case relations. Obviously the different intuitive use of the synonymy is one reason for the rather chaotic situation. III. A discussion of (23-24) and (18) shows furthermore that a relation or operatfon mentioned in T. provides the means for a distinction of different agents as John and Jim in (21-22) or the two agents in (18): In the latter case b is an &amp;quot;influenced agent&amp;quot;. This has to be expressed precisely by the modification rules. (of a) (of b) and (22) are not different case.</abstract>

They have to be taken into account as well, and only both aspects together will yield an adequate picture. 2. Case relations and semantic predicates One possibility to grasp the whole problem seems to be the definition of case relations on the basis of semantic predicates. Sememes (of verb-lexemes) are represented by expressions containing primitive semantic predicates. The following expression may be assigned to a verb like &amp;quot;to convey&amp;quot;: (a conveys b from c to d) (1) MOVE-ACTION(a,b,c,d) .ACAUSE(a,CHANGE-POSITION(b,c,d)) (cf. Allen 1984). I will not discuss the question whether ACAUSE (= &amp;quot;agent causation&amp;quot;) and CHANGE-POSITION are indeed 302 primitive predicates. I consider them here as that. Furthermore one may discuss whether (5) sufficiently describes the meaning of &amp;quot;to convey&amp;quot;. The idea of extracting case relations from representations like (1) can be bases on the following principles: (A) For each primitive predicate P there is an assignment of exactly one case relation to every argument placei: zi(P) = ri (i-th argument of P has case relation ri) (B) There are modification rules for case relations which render it possibl</context>

I will not enter into the terminological discussion on deep cases, case relations etc. and subsume all these variants under the label &amp;quot;case relation&amp;quot;. This is justified by the obvious fact that there are more proposals and systems than authors. So one will not overcome this chaos by neat terminological distinctions. It is rather typical for publications on deep cases that proposals are presented without sufficient motivation or justification (e. g. Nilsen 1973). It has turned out that in the matter of case relations as a field of linguistic and fundamental research intuition and language competence cannot show the right way how to solve the problems of defining them. This is my first conclusion from the general scene. Without doubt it is inevitable to work out some principles on the basis of which case relations may be defined.

Formally this may be expressed by a four-place &amp;quot;modification mapping&amp;quot; m: (5) z2(MOVE-ACTION) = mcACAUSE, z2(ACAUSE), GRANGE-POSITION, z1 (CHANGE-POSITION)) One may speculate whether all four arguments are indeed necessary, they are surely not. A similar idea is presented in Thiel 1982 (p. 84 ff.), where the mechanism of modification is applied, too. A general scheme for (B) is the following: Assume one has (6) q(...,x,...) =R(..., S(...,x,...),...) where x is the j-th argument in Q, S(...) the k-th argument in R and x the l-th argument in S. Then zj(Q) is a function of R, zk(R), S and zi(S). proposal, namely zi(Q) = m(R, zl(S)), would cause some difficulties, if R is a many place predicate and there are in R arguments S&apos; and S&amp;quot; with z1u (S1)=z1m(S&amp;quot;) (cf. the FEED-example below).

But at first I take an example: (7) SET(a,b,c) = ACAUSE(a,BECOME(SIT(b,c))) (8) z2(SIT) = locative By a simplification of the general scheme (four-place function m as in (5)) to the special variant one would obtain for (7-8): (9) z3(SET) m(ACAUSE,mcBECOME,locative)) = m(ACAUSE,directive) = directive There are arguments for the assumption that BECOME (and not ACAUSE) modifies locative to directive (or goal): The description of &amp;quot;to get to a place&amp;quot; contains the expression (10) BECOME(BE(b,c)) (as in (7)) Here one has the same modification of locative to directive. This is in accordance with Thiel 1982. Instead of (7) one could take another expression, e. g. by using the predicate ECAUSE (event causation) with the interpretation that &amp;quot;an activity of a causes BECOME(STT(b,c))&amp;quot;: (11) SET(a,b,c) = ECAUSE(ACT(a), BECOME(SIT(b,c))) Here the application of (A) and (B) is not quite the same, one has here instead of (12) z1(SET) = zi(ACAUSE) for (7) a modification (13) z1(SET) = m(ECAUSE,z,(ACT)) m(ECAUSE,agentiv) = &amp;quot;causator&amp;quot; ?

One surely cannot assume that z1(ACAUSE) is the same relation as (17) m(ACAUSE,m(BECOME,zi(KNOW))) if one makes the same simplification as for (7). Another question appears in (18) FEED(a,b,c) = ACAUSE(a,EAT(b,c)) This time one has two agents (a and b). The next question is due to reflexive verbs. If we take German examples, we have e. g. (19) Er wascht sich * Er wasent ihn as in English, too (himself * him). Here the case relation of &amp;quot;Er&amp;quot; should be a mixture between agent and something like experiencer or patiens (cf. Thiel 1982, p. 104 f.). The second components may not be left out because of the reflexive verbs proper in German as &amp;quot;sich furchten&amp;quot; (to be afraid, &amp;quot;sich schamen&amp;quot; (to be ashamed).
