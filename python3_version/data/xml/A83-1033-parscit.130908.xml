The central question to be addressed by this
panel is how the provision of natural language
access influences the design and implementation
of database systems. Within this, there are
(at least) the following four issues to discuss:
1. The augmentation of data models to support
the specific requirements of natural language
access.
This is perhaps the broadest category. Among
the particular demands of natural language access
are: treatment of lexicon and lexical ambigu-
ities; use of parenthetical expressions which may
require simultaneous update and query; support
for the generation of natural language responses;
storage of discourse information; representation
of text structure models; accurate processing of
natural language updates; and other interactions
that, though not unique to natural language
access, have special problems in that context,
such as natural language queries to dynamic
databases requiring natural language statements
of alerting conditions, or answering &amp;quot;meta-
questions&amp;quot; - questions about structure. Current
work in all these areas suggests the need to
augment data models in particular ways.
2. Ideas for data models that arise from the
study of natural language semantics.
This category is related to the first, but
the emphasis here is that researchers in natural
language are developing ideas about modelling that
can be very helpful in database modelling. One
example of this is the uniform use of first-order
logic as the &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot; of natural language
sentences as the representation of knowledge and
data, and as the medium for deductive retrieval.
Another example is the development of concepts of
intensionality that support the notion of an
&amp;quot;historical&amp;quot; database system.
3. The organization of information in database
systems to enhance the portability of natural
language interfaces.
Many researchers are investigating how to
reduce the difficulty of moving a natural
language interface from one database system to
another. The problems in doing this include what
Information is needed, how the information should
be divided into modules, and what algorithms are
needed to acquire the necessary information for
a new database. There are obvious ramifications
on database structure for achieving various
levels of natural language interface portability.
4. The requirements imposed on conventional
database systems that function as the back end of
natural language processing systems.
Looking at natural language research itself,
most researchers develop their own information
storage and retrieval mechanisms specifically
tailored to the kinds of data structures that
arise in natural language processing. However,
there is some recent work in investigating how
conventional database systems could be used in
this role. This work is bound to have important
effects in the future design of databases that
deal in less regular structures than we are
used to.
