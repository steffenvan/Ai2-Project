The resolution of local syntactic
ambiguity by the Human Sentence Processing
Mechanism is a topic which has provoked
considerable interest in recent years. At
issue is whether such ambiguities are
resolved on the basis of syntactic
information alone (cf. Minimal Attachment
- Frazier, 1979), or whether they are
resolved on some other basis. Crain &amp;
Steedman (1982) suggest that the
resolution process is governed not by
Minimal Attachment but instead by whether
or not a referring expression provides
sufficient information with which to
identify a unique referent. Such an
approach relies on the provision of
adequate contextual information, something
which has been lacking in experiments
which have been claimed to support Minimal
Attachment. In this paper I shall
consider a number of such experiments, and
the different patterns of results which
emerge once contextual information is
provided. Although the importance of
contextual information will be stressed, I
shall briefly consider reasons why parsing
preferences arise in the absence of any
explicit prior context. The conclusion is
that computational models of syntactic
ambiguity resolution which are based on
evidence which has ignored contextual
considerations are models of something
other than natural language processing.
There has been much controversy
recently surrounding the processes
responsible for the &amp;quot;garden path&amp;quot; effect
Ln the following kind of example:
The oil tycoon sold the off-shore
oil tracts for a lot of money
wanted to kill J.R.
The garden path effect arises here because
the Human Sentence Processing Mechanism
(&amp;quot;HSPM&amp;quot;) encounters, during the processing
of this sentence, a local syntactic
ambiguity. The word &amp;quot;sold&amp;quot; is ambiguous:
it can be interpreted either as a simple
active, or it can be interpreted as a past
participle, in a reduced passive. The
only way to make the whole string into a
sentence is to interpret it as a reduced
form of the passive. However, what seems
to happen in this (and similar) examples
is that people tend to interpret the word
&amp;quot;sold&amp;quot; as the main verb. This tendency
leads them down a syntactic garden path.
So the HSPM exhibits a preference for
one analysis over another when faced with
a local ambiguity. But why? A number of
suggestions have been made concerning
this. One suggestion, originally proposed
by Kimball (1973) and followed up more
recently by Frazier (1979) and Rayner,
Carlson, &amp; Frazier (1983), is that the
HSPM takes into account the syntactic
structure of these sentences. There are
two possible structures which could be
assigned to the ambiguous sentence
fragment
The oil tycoon sold the off-shore
oil tracts ...
The reduced passive interpretation
requires an extra NP node as compared to
the main verb interpretation. Kimball
(1975) and Frazier suggest that when more
than one interpretation is possible, one
pursues that interpretation which creates
the structure with fewest nodes. This is
what Frazier calls the Principle of
Minimal Attachment.
This structural hypothesis proposes,
then, that an initial decision is made on
grounds of syntactic structure alone. If
it subsequently turns out to be the wrong
decision (on grounds of &amp;quot;implausibility&amp;quot;),
the alternative analysis (which is
identified on the basis of &amp;quot;thematic
selection&amp;quot; - Rayner et al., 1983) is then,
and only then, attempted. In support of
this claim, Rayner et al. collected
reading times and eye movement data for
sentences which, syntactically speaking,
allow two attachment sites for a
prepositional phrase: one attachment, to
an NP, requires an extra NP node as
compared to the other attachment, which is
to a VP.

The burglar blew open the safe with the
dynamite (Minimal attachment to VP)
The burglar blew open the safe with the
diamonds (Non-minimal attachment to NP)
In the case of the non-minimally attached
version, the correct attachment (to the
NP) would be attempted only after the
minimal attachment to the VP had first
been tried. As they had predicted,
reading times to the non-minimally
attached versions were significantly
longer than to the minimally attached
versions.
An alternative to Minimal Attachment
is proposed by Ford, Bresnan, &amp; Kaplan
(1982), who suggest that these preferences
arise from the order in which
lexical/syntactic rules in the grammar can
be accessed (cf. Wanner&apos;s
&amp;quot;implementation&amp;quot; of Minimal Attachment,
1980). Ford et al.&apos;s theory of Lexical
Preference is more powerful than Minimal
Attachment because this ordering can, in
part, be determined by the actual lexical
items which are involved. But these two
proposals are both, in effect,
structurally based. They take no account
of the referential function of the
particular constructions involved.
Stephen Crain (Crain, 1980, discussed
in Crain &amp; Steedman, 1982) noted that what
many of the garden-path sentences have in
common is that of the two possible
analyses, one is functionally equivalent
to, or identical with, a restrictive
relative clause. Nounphrases are used by
the speaker to refer to objects. The
function of a restrictive relative is to
give additional information as to who or
what is being talked about. This
additional information is necessary
because without it, there would be
insufficient evidence with which to
determine who or what was being referred
to. So restrictive relatives are used
because if we&apos;d just heard the expression
the oil tycoon&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the safe&amp;quot; we would
not have known just which candidate &amp;quot;oil
tycoon&amp;quot; or which candidate &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; was
intended. But where do these different
&amp;quot;candidate&amp;quot; &amp;quot;oil tycoons&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;safes&amp;quot; come
from? Normally, they must presumably be
introduced into the discourse some time
before these target sentences are
encountered, and represented by speaker
and hearer in some kind of model of the
discourse. There is a sense in which all
of these examples are unnatural because
each sentence is presented in isolation.
We refer to &amp;quot;the oil tycoon&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the
off-shore oil tracts&amp;quot;, but we&apos;ve never
mentioned them before. To control for
this, we should really present these
target sentences embedded in a context.
Stephen Crain did just this: using an
incremental grammaticality judgement task,
and a class of ambiguity which is
different in form but the same in
principle (see below), he showed that
garden path effects could be overcome or
induced depending on the referential
nature of the context (i.e. depending on
whether just one &amp;quot;oil tycoon&amp;quot; or more than
one &amp;quot;oil tycoon&amp;quot; had been introduced in
the preceding text). The work of Crain
suggests that a major methodological
shortcoming in the work of Frazier (1979),
Rayner et al. (1983) and Ford et al.
(1982) is the absence of any context
within which the particular syntactic
constructions they were studying could be
allowed to function. There is thus a very
definite sense in which the processing of
these constructions will have been
abnormal. It follows that a suitable test
of Rayner et al.&apos;s claims is to replicate
their experiment using the same reading
time task, but with the provision of
contexts which are felicitous with one or
other of the two versions of their
examples.
The following contexts were devised
for an experiment (Altmann, forthcoming,
and Altmann &amp; Steedman, forthcoming):
To induce attachment to NP
A burglar carrying some dynamite
broke into an heiress&apos;s house.
Once inside he found two safes.
One of them had some diamonds
inside whilst the other had
several priceless emeralds.
12 induce attachment to VP
A burglar carrying some dynamite
broke into an heiress&apos;s house.
Once inside he found a safe and a
jewelry box. One of them had some
diamonds inside whilst the other
had several priceless emeralds.
Minimal (VP) attachment
The burglar blew open the safe
with the dynamite.
Non-minimal (NP) attachment
The burglar blew open the safe
with the diamonds.
These examples are &amp;quot;minimally-different&amp;quot;
to the extent that the only difference
between them is the change from &amp;quot;two
safes&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;a safe and a jewelry box&amp;quot;.
This is a change which, in theory, affects
only the cardinality of the set of
&amp;quot;safes&amp;quot;.
It was found that there was a strong
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.988665131147541">
effect of referential context on the non-
minimally (NP) attached targets (230
msec). Furthermore, reading times to
these were considerably faster than
reading times to the minimally (VP)
attached versions (there was a difference
of 348 msec in the &amp;quot;NP-inducing&amp;quot;
conditions, and 190 msec overall1 ). This
is of course the reverse of what would be
expected on a Minimal Attachment or
Lexical Preference account. Neither of
these could account for this effect
without having to discount the
experimental evidence which currently
supports them.
However,, it was also found that there
was no effect of context on the minimally
(VP) attached targets (the difference in
reading time across the two context
conditions was only 78 msec). This was
surprising given that the &amp;quot;VP-inducing&amp;quot;
context should have been felicitous with
this target, and the &amp;quot;NP-inducing&amp;quot; context
infelicitous. It became apparent,
however, that neither of these contexts
was in fact felicitous with VP-attachment.
The function of a PP when attached to
an NP, in these examples, is to provide
additional and necessary information with
which to identify a particular object in
the discourse model. As such it must be
providing GIVEN information (cf. Clark &amp;
Haviland, 1977). The function of a PP
when attached to a verb, is to provide NEW
information about the action denoted by
the verb: the burglar didn&apos;t simply blow
open the safe, he blew it open with the
dynamite. This in turn, presupposes that
the action denoted by the verb (&amp;quot;blow
open&amp;quot;) is GIVEN. In the so-called &amp;quot;VP-
inducing&amp;quot; context, this was not the case:
the co-text (that is, the preceding text)
was not felicitous with the VP-attachment.
A second experiment was run in which the
&amp;quot;blowing open&amp;quot; was known about by subjects
in advance of the target sentence (i.e.
was Given), and this time, strong effects
of context were found on both kinds of
target (113 msec for NP-attached targets
across the two conditions of context, and
358 msec for the VP-attached targets).
Once again, the non-minimally attached
targets were significantly faster than the
minimally attached targets (486 msec in
the NP-inducing condition, and 245 msec
overall).
What seems to be important, then, is
not so much the structure of a
construction, but rather the
presuppositions which are implicated by
its use. If these presuppositions have
</bodyText>

All reported differences were signi-
ficant at least at p&lt;0.05.
been satisfied by the preceding discourse,
then that construction will be favoured
over a construction whose associated
presuppositions have not been satisfied.
This notion is important because its
application to another class of ambiguity
phenomena suggests that evidence
previously thought to favour lexical or
structural accounts of the resolution
process does not bear on the issue of
ambiguity resolution at all.
In the following ambiguous example,
the complement clause analysis of the
&amp;quot;that-clause&amp;quot; is preferred to the relative
clause analysis (e.g. WanneT, Kaplan, &amp;
Shiner, 1974).
The boy told the girl that he
liked the story
Furthermore, even when the relative clause
analysis is initially chosen, these
examples take longer to process (via a
reading time measure) than when the
complement analysis is chosen (e.g.
Wanner, Kaplan, &amp; Shiner, 1974; Altmann,
forthcoming), In other words, the
relative clause analysis is not just the
least preferred, but is also the more
&amp;quot;complex&amp;quot;. The general explanation is
that, in the example above, the noun
phrase &amp;quot;the girl&amp;quot; is preferentially
treated as a simple NP, and not as the
first NP constituent in a complex NP.
Wanner et al. (1974) and Wanner (1980)
model these effects using an ATN, and show
that they can be made to arise from
peculiarities of the order in which arcs
leave certain states. Frazier &amp; Fodor
(1978) cite this observation in support of
Minimal Attachment, whilst Ford et al.
(1982) would predict this effect on the
basis of their theory of lexical and
syntactic preferences, in which the simple
NP expansion is ordered before the complex
NP expansion.
With regard to the preference for
complements over relatives, Crain&apos;s
original demonstration of referential
context effects used examples which
exhibited this same class of local
ambiguity. However, by the nature of the
task he employed, Crain did not address
the issue of complexity.
Restrictive relatives provide Given
information, and the information contained
within the relative must therefore be
matched against information which already
exists in the hearer&apos;s model of the
universe. This matching process
presumably requires a certain amount of
inferencing, or &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot; (cf. Haviland
&amp; Clark, 1974; Sanford &amp; Garrod, 1981).
Complement clauses require no such
matching process, and are therefore less
complex. The inferencing process can only
</bodyText>

125
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.992887321739131">
be controlled for if the materials under
study are preceded by felicitous co-texts.
To assess the contribution of inferencing
to processing time, an experiment was run
(Altmann, forthcoming) using the following
examples (which are similar to those used
by Crain, 1980).
&amp;quot;INFERENCING&amp;quot;
A policeman was questioning two
women. He was suspicious of one
of them but not of the other.
&amp;quot;MINIMAL INFERENCING&amp;quot;
A policeman was questioning two
women. He had his doubts about
one of them but not about the oth-
er.
RELATIVE CLAUSE TARGET
The policeman told the woman that
he had his doubts about to tell
the truth.
COMPLEMENT CLAUSE TARGET
The policeman told the woman that
he had his doubts about her clever
alibi.
(The underlining was not present in the
experimental items.) The amount of
inferencing required to process the
relative target was manipulated by
changing the (underlined) wording in the
preceding co-text from &amp;quot;was suspicious of&amp;quot;
(&amp;quot;inferencing&amp;quot;) to &amp;quot;had his doubts about&amp;quot;
(&amp;quot;minimal inferencing&amp;quot;). Apart from
finding strong effects of context (thereby
replicating Crain&apos;s experiment but with a
different methodology - reading, time), it
was found that there was no absolute
difference between complement targets and
relative targets once context and
inferencing were controlled for (only 31
msec in the &amp;quot;minimal inferencing&amp;quot;
condition vs. 385 msec in the
&amp;quot;inferencing&amp;quot; condition).
It would appear, then, that much of
the evidence cited in the literature
concerning the resolution of local
syntactic ambiguity has been
misinterpreted because these studies have
failed to consider the referential
function of the constructions in question.
An account of syntactic ambiguity
resolution has been alluded to which is
based on a notion of referential context
and discourse models. More specifically,
it is an account based on the act of
establishing what is, and what is not,
already known to the hearer. But although
it can explain parsing preferences when a
target sentence is embedded in a
discourse, can it also account for the
preferences exhibited in isolated
sentences (the &amp;quot;null context&amp;quot; - cf. the
original &amp;quot;oil tycoon&amp;quot; example)?
In the absence of any preceding
discourse, there can exist no discourse
model within which to integrate the
information contained within the isolated
sentence. In such cases, nothing can be
succesfully interpreted as Given
information. It follows that all incoming
material must be treated as if it provides
New information. If the incoming material
is ambiguous, between a reading which
promises New information (e.g. a
complement clause) and one which promises
Given information (e.g. a relative
clause), then in the null context the
former interpretation must be chosen. In
general, if there is_a choice between a
complex NP analysis, which implicates
additional Given information by which to
identify the intended referent, and a
simple NP analysis, then in the null
context2 the simple NP analysis must be
chosen.
Structurally based theories of local
syntactic ambiguity resolution can account
for the null context data, but cannot
account for the data concerning contextual
effects on ambiguity resolution. The
present accort can be applied to both
sets of data.
Many studies have, in the past,
viewed syntax as being concerned with the
relations which hold within single
sentences. Such a view is short-sighted,
however. Within a dialogue, the speaker&apos;s
intention is to evoke a specific set of
2
Although this explains the prefer-
ence, in the null context, for complement
clauses over relative clauses, it does not
explain the increased complexity of rela-
tive clauses. This is explained as fol-
lows: the relative clause intepretation
violates more presuppositions (concerning
the state of the hearer&apos;s discourse model)
than does the complement clause interpre-
tation (see Crain &amp; Steedman, 1982, and
Altmann &amp; Steedman, forthcoming, for dis-
cussion). The reported experiments demon-
strated that such violations lead to in-
creased reading times. The relative
clause interpretation induces longer read-
ing times because of the increased number
of these violations.

It is argued in Altmann (forthcoming)
and Altmann &amp; Steedman (forthcoming), that
an account based on the distinction
between what is and what is not already
known to the hearer/reader (here defined
as the distinction between Given and New)
will also generalise to the examples which
have, on &amp;quot;structural&amp;quot; accounts, been ex-
plained by Right Association (Kimball,

processes in the hearer. This is
achieved, in part, by way of the syntactic
constructions which the speaker chooses to
adopt. The role of these processes is to
establish a relationship between the
information conveyed by the utterance, and
the information already known to the
hearer. Such processes must therefore
address information which is both internal
and external to the utterance. Studies
which purport either to investigate
syntactic processing empirically, or to
model it computationally, should not
ignore the role or the requirements of
these processes. To do so is to study
something other than natural language
processing.

(GB) ABSTRACT The resolution of local syntactic ambiguity by the Human Sentence Processing Mechanism is a topic which has provoked considerable interest in recent years. At issue is whether such ambiguities are resolved on the basis of syntactic information alone (cf. Minimal Attachment - Frazier, 1979), or whether they are resolved on some other basis. Crain &amp; Steedman (1982) suggest that the resolution process is governed not by Minimal Attachment but instead by whether or not a referring expression provides sufficient information with which to identify a unique referent. Such an approach relies on the provision of adequate contextual information, something which has been lacking in experiments which have been claimed to support Minimal Attachment. In this paper I shall consider a number of such experiments, and the different patterns of results which emerge once contextual information is provided. Although the importance of contextual information will be stressed, I shall briefly consider reasons why parsing preferences arise in the absence of any explicit prior context. The conclusion is that computational models of syntactic which are based on evidence which has ignored contextual considerations are models of something than naturallanguage processing. There has been much controversy recently surrounding the processes responsible for the &amp;quot;garden path&amp;quot; effect Ln the following kind of example: The oil tycoon sold the off-shore oil tracts for a lot of money wanted to kill J.R. The garden path effect arises here because the Human Sentence Processing Mechanism (&amp;quot;HSPM&amp;quot;) encounters, during the processing of this sentence, a local syntactic ambiguity. The word &amp;quot;sold&amp;quot; is ambiguous: it can be interpreted either as a simple active, or it can be interpreted as a past participle, in a reduced passive. The only way to make the whole string into a sentence is to interpret it as a reduced form of the passive. However, what seems to happen in this (and similar) examples is that people tend to interpret the word &amp;quot;sold&amp;quot; as the main verb. This tendency leads them down a syntactic garden path. So the HSPM exhibits a preference for one analysis over another when faced with a local ambiguity. But why? A number of suggestions have been made concerning this. One suggestion, originally proposed by Kimball (1973) and followed up more recently by Frazier (1979) and Rayner, Carlson, &amp; Frazier (1983), is that the HSPM takes into account the syntactic structure of these sentences. There are two possible structures which could be assigned to the ambiguous sentence fragment The oil tycoon sold the off-shore oil tracts ... The reduced passive interpretation requires an extra NP node as compared to the main verb interpretation. Kimball (1975) and Frazier suggest that when more than one interpretation is possible, one pursues that interpretation which creates the structure with fewest nodes. This is what Frazier calls the Principle of Minimal Attachment. This structural hypothesis proposes, then, that an initial decision is made on grounds of syntactic structure alone. If it subsequently turns out to be the wrong decision (on grounds of &amp;quot;implausibility&amp;quot;), the alternative analysis (which is identified on the basis of &amp;quot;thematic selection&amp;quot; - Rayner et al., 1983) is then, onlythen, attempted. In support of this claim, Rayner et al. collected reading times and eye movement data for sentences which, syntactically speaking, allow two attachment sites for a prepositional phrase: one attachment, to an NP, requires an extra NP node as compared to the other attachment, which is to a VP. 123 The burglar blew open the safe with the dynamite (Minimal attachment to VP) The burglar blew open the safe with the diamonds (Non-minimal attachment to NP) In the case of the non-minimally attached version, the correct attachment (to the would be attempted only afterthe minimal attachment to the VP had first been tried.

But where do these different &amp;quot;candidate&amp;quot; &amp;quot;oil tycoons&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;safes&amp;quot; come from? Normally, they must presumably be introduced into the discourse some time beforethese target sentences are encountered, and represented by speaker and hearer in some kind of model of the discourse. There is a sense in which all of these examples are unnatural because each sentence is presented in isolation. We refer to &amp;quot;the oil tycoon&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the off-shore oil tracts&amp;quot;, but we&apos;ve never mentioned them before. To control for this, we should really present these target sentences embedded in a context. Stephen Crain did just this: using an incremental grammaticality judgement task, and a class of ambiguity which is different in form but the same in principle (see below), he showed that garden path effects could be overcome or induced depending on the referential nature of the context (i.e. depending on whether just one &amp;quot;oil tycoon&amp;quot; or more than one &amp;quot;oil tycoon&amp;quot; had been introduced in the preceding text). The work of Crain suggests that a major methodological shortcoming in the work of Frazier (1979), Rayner et al. (1983) and Ford et al. (1982) is the absence of any context within which the particular syntactic constructions they were studying could be allowed to function. There is thus a very definite sense in which the processing of these constructions will have been abnormal. It follows that a suitable test of Rayner et al.&apos;s claims is to replicate their experiment using the same reading time task, but with the provision of contexts which are felicitous with one or other of the two versions of their examples. The following contexts were devised for an experiment (Altmann, forthcoming, and Altmann &amp; Steedman, forthcoming): attachmentto NP A burglar carrying some dynamite broke into an heiress&apos;s house. Once inside he found two safes. One of them had some diamonds inside whilst the other had several priceless emeralds. attachmentto VP A burglar carrying some dynamite broke into an heiress&apos;s house. Once inside he found a safe and a jewelry box. One of them had some diamonds inside whilst the other had several priceless emeralds. Minimal(VP) The burglar blew open the safe with the dynamite. (NP) The burglar blew open the safe with the diamonds. These examples are &amp;quot;minimally-different&amp;quot; to the extent that the only difference between them is the change from &amp;quot;two safes&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;a safe and a jewelry box&amp;quot;. This is a change which, in theory, affects only the cardinality of the set of &amp;quot;safes&amp;quot;. It was found that there was a strong 124 effect of referential context on the nonminimally (NP) attached targets (230 msec). Furthermore, reading times to these were considerably faster than reading times to the minimally (VP) attached versions (there was a difference of 348 msec in the &amp;quot;NP-inducing&amp;quot; and 190 msec This is of course the reverse of what would be on a Minimal Attachment Lexical Preference account. Neither of these could account for this effect without having to discount the experimental evidence which currently supports them. However,, it was also found that there was no effect of context on the minimally (VP) attached targets (the difference in reading time across the two context conditions was only 78 msec). This was surprising given that the &amp;quot;VP-inducing&amp;quot; context should have been felicitous with this target, and the &amp;quot;NP-inducing&amp;quot; context infelicitous. It became apparent, that neitherof these contexts was in fact felicitous with VP-attachment. The function of a PP when attached to an NP, in these examples, is to provide additional and necessary information with which to identify a particular object in the discourse model. As such it must be providing GIVEN information (cf. Clark &amp; Haviland, 1977). The function of a PP when attached to a verb, is to provide NEW information about the action denoted by the verb: the burglar didn&apos;t simply blow open the safe, he blew it open with the dynamite. This in turn, presupposes that the action denoted by the verb (&amp;quot;blow is GIVEN. In the so-called inducing&amp;quot; context, this was not the case: the co-text (that is, the preceding text) was not felicitous with the VP-attachment. A second experiment was run in which the &amp;quot;blowing open&amp;quot; was known about by subjects in advance of the target sentence (i.e. was Given), and this time, strong effects context were found on bothkinds of target (113 msec for NP-attached targets across the two conditions of context, and 358 msec for the VP-attached targets). Once again, the non-minimally attached targets were significantly faster than the minimally attached targets (486 msec in the NP-inducing condition, and 245 msec overall). What seems to be important, then, is not so much the structure of a construction, but rather the presuppositions which are implicated by its use. If these presuppositions have 1 reported differences were significant at least at p&lt;0.05. been satisfied by the preceding discourse, then that construction will be favoured over a construction whose associated presuppositions have not been satisfied. This notion is important because its application to another class of ambiguity phenomena suggests that evidence previously thought to favour lexical or structural accounts of the resolution process does not bear on the issue of ambiguity resolution at all. In the following ambiguous example, the complement clause analysis of the &amp;quot;that-clause&amp;quot; is preferred to the relative clause analysis (e.g. WanneT, Kaplan, &amp; Shiner, 1974). The boy told the girl that he liked the story Furthermore, even when the relative clause analysis is initially chosen, these examples take longer to process (via a reading time measure) than when the complement analysis is chosen (e.g. Wanner, Kaplan, &amp; Shiner, 1974; Altmann, forthcoming), In other words, the relative clause analysis is not just the least preferred, but is also the more &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot;. The general explanation is that, in the example above, the noun phrase &amp;quot;the girl&amp;quot; is preferentially treated as a simple NP, and not as the first NP constituent in a complex NP. Wanner et al. (1974) and Wanner (1980) model these effects using an ATN, and show that they can be made to arise from peculiarities of the order in which arcs leave certain states. Frazier &amp; Fodor (1978) cite this observation in support of Minimal Attachment, whilst Ford et al. (1982) would predict this effect on the basis of their theory of lexical and syntactic preferences, in which the simple NP expansion is ordered before the complex NP expansion. With regard to the preference for complements over relatives, Crain&apos;s original demonstration of referential context effects used examples which exhibited this same class of local ambiguity. However, by the nature of the task he employed, Crain did not address the issue of complexity. Restrictive relatives provide Given information, and the information contained within the relative must therefore be matched against information which already exists in the hearer&apos;s model of the universe. This matching process presumably requires a certain amount of inferencing, or &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot; (cf. Haviland &amp; Clark, 1974; Sanford &amp; Garrod, 1981). Complement clauses require no such matching process, and are therefore less complex. The inferencing process can only 125 be controlled for if the materials under are preceded by felicitous the contribution of inferencing processing time, experiment was run (Altmann, forthcoming) using the following examples (which are similar to those used by Crain, 1980). &amp;quot;INFERENCING&amp;quot; A policeman was questioning two He was suspiciousof one of them but not of the other. &amp;quot;MINIMAL INFERENCING&amp;quot; A policeman was questioning two He had his about one of them but not about the other. RELATIVE CLAUSE TARGET The policeman told the woman that had his aboutto tell the truth. COMPLEMENT CLAUSE TARGET The policeman told the woman that he had his doubts about her clever alibi. (The underlining was not present in the experimental items.) The amount of inferencing required to process the relative target was manipulated by changing the (underlined) wording in the preceding co-text from &amp;quot;was suspicious of&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;inferencing&amp;quot;) to &amp;quot;had his doubts about&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;minimal inferencing&amp;quot;). Apart from finding strong effects of context (thereby Crain&apos;s but with a different methodology reading, time), it was found that there was no absolute difference between complement targets and targets once context were controlled for (only in &amp;quot;minimal inferencing&amp;quot; condition vs. 385 msec in the &amp;quot;inferencing&amp;quot; condition). It would appear, then, that much of the evidence cited in the literature concerning the resolution of local syntactic ambiguity has been misinterpreted because these studies have failed to consider the referential function of the constructions in question. An account of syntactic ambiguity resolution has been alluded to which is based on a notion of referential context and discourse models. More specifically, it is an account based on the act of establishing what is, and what is not, already known to the hearer. But although it can explain parsing preferences when a target sentence is embedded in a discourse, can it also account for the preferences exhibited in isolated sentences (the &amp;quot;null context&amp;quot; cf. the original &amp;quot;oil tycoon&amp;quot; example)? In the absence of any preceding there exist no discourse model within which to integrate the information contained within the isolated sentence. In such cases, nothing can be succesfully interpreted as Given information. It follows that all incoming material must be treated as if it provides New information. If the incoming material is ambiguous, between a reading which promises New information (e.g. a complement clause) and one which promises Given information (e.g. a relative clause), then in the null context the former interpretation must be chosen. In general, if there is_a choice between a complex NP analysis, which implicates additional Given information by which to identify the intended referent, and a simple NP analysis, then in the null simple NP analysis must be Structurally based theories of local syntactic ambiguity resolution can account for the null context data, but cannot account for the data concerning contextual effects on ambiguity resolution. The present accort can be applied to both sets of data. Many studies have, in the past, viewed syntax as being concerned with the relations which hold within single sentences. Such a view is short-sighted, however. Within a dialogue, the speaker&apos;s intention is to evoke a specific set of 2 this explains the preference, in the null context, for complement clauses over relative clauses, it does not explain the increased complexity of relative clauses. This is explained as follows: the relative clause intepretation violates more presuppositions (concerning the state of the hearer&apos;s discourse model) than does the complement clause interpretation (see Crain &amp; Steedman, 1982, and Altmann &amp; Steedman, forthcoming, for discussion). The reported experiments demonstrated that such violations lead to increased reading times. The relative clause interpretation induces longer reading times because of the increased number of these violations. 3 It is argued in Altmann (forthcoming) and Altmann &amp; Steedman (forthcoming), that an account based on the distinction between what is and what is not already known to the hearer/reader (here defined as the distinction between Given and New) will also generalise to the examples which have, on &amp;quot;structural&amp;quot; accounts, been explained by Right Association (Kimball, 1973) and Late Closure (Frazier, 1979). 126 processes in the hearer. This is achieved, in part, by way of the syntactic constructions which the speaker chooses to adopt. The role of these processes is to establish a relationship between the information conveyed by the utterance, and the information already known to the hearer. Such processes must therefore address information which is both internal and external to the utterance. Studies which purport either to investigate syntactic processing empirically, or to model it computationally, should not ignore the role or the requirements of these processes. To do so is to study something other than natural language processing.

The only way to make the whole string into a sentence is to interpret it as a reduced form of the passive. However, what seems to happen in this (and similar) examples is that people tend to interpret the word &amp;quot;sold&amp;quot; as the main verb. This tendency leads them down a syntactic garden path. So the HSPM exhibits a preference for one analysis over another when faced with a local ambiguity. But why? A number of suggestions have been made concerning this. One suggestion, originally proposed by Kimball (1973) and followed up more recently by Frazier (1979) and Rayner, Carlson, &amp; Frazier (1983), is that the HSPM takes into account the syntactic structure of these sentences. There are two possible structures which could be assigned to the ambiguous sentence fragment The oil tycoon sold the off-shore oil tracts ... The reduced passive interpretation requires an extra NP node as compared to the main verb interpretation.

There is thus a very definite sense in which the processing of these constructions will have been abnormal. It follows that a suitable test of Rayner et al.&apos;s claims is to replicate their experiment using the same reading time task, but with the provision of contexts which are felicitous with one or other of the two versions of their examples. The following contexts were devised for an experiment (Altmann, forthcoming, </context>

The relative clause interpretation induces longer reading times because of the increased number of these violations. 3 It is argued in Altmann (forthcoming) and Altmann &amp; Steedman (forthcoming), that an account based on the distinction between what is and what is not already known to the hearer/reader (here defined as the distinction between Given and New) will also generalise to the examples which have, on &amp;quot;structural&amp;quot; accounts, been explained by Right Association (Kimball, 1973) and Late Closure (Frazier, 1979). 126 processes in the hearer.

However, by the nature of the task he employed, Crain did not address the issue of complexity. Restrictive relatives provide Given information, and the information contained within the relative must therefore be matched against information which already exists in the hearer&apos;s model of the universe. This matching process presumably requires a certain amount of inferencing, or &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot; (cf. Haviland &amp; Clark, 1974; Sanford &amp; Garrod, 1981). Complement clauses require no such matching process, and are therefore less complex. The inferencing process can only 125 be controlled for if the materials under study are preceded by felicitous co-texts. To assess the contribution of inferencing to processing time, an experiment was run (Altmann, forthcoming) using the following examples (which are similar to those used by Crain, 1980). &amp;quot;INFERENCING&amp;quot; A policeman was questioning two women.

The only way to make the whole string into a sentence is to interpret it as a reduced form of the passive. However, what seems to happen in this (and similar) examples is that people tend to interpret the word &amp;quot;sold&amp;quot; as the main verb. This tendency leads them down a syntactic garden path. So the HSPM exhibits a preference for one analysis over another when faced with a local ambiguity. But why? A number of suggestions have been made concerning this. One suggestion, originally proposed by Kimball (1973) and followed up more recently by Frazier (1979) and Rayner, Carlson, &amp; Frazier (1983), is that the HSPM takes into account the syntactic structure of these sentences.
