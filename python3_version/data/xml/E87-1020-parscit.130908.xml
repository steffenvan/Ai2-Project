The system presented in this paper pro-
duces bilingual passages of text from an
original (source) text and one (or more)
of its translated versions.
The source text passage includes words
or word compounds which a translator wants
to retrieve for the current translating of
another text. The target text pasÂ§age is
the equivalent version of the source text
passage. On the basis of a comparison of
the contexts of these words in the concor-
ded passage and his own text, the transla-
tor has to decide on the utility of the
translation proposed in the target text
passage.
The program might become a component of
translator&apos;s work bench.
Introduction
Computers can contribute to translation
either automatically or as an aid to the
human translator (machine-aided transla-
tion). The latter represents a large spec-
trum of different approaches as to the de-
gree of human intervention in the transla-
tion process and to the method(s). Some
systems are semi-automatic in the sense
that they only ask for human intervention
for the resolution of ambiguities (Melby,
1981). Other systems are designed to re-
lieve the human translator of some tedious
aspects (such as dictionary look-up) of
the translation work, either interactively
via a terminal or by batch processing
overnight.As to method(s), most systems
are based on dictionary look-ups - some-
times combined with automatic insertion of
the retrieved equivalents (McNaught, So-
mers, 1979).
This paper will describe an alternative
method, REFTEX. A major difference between
REFTEX and most other machine-aided trans-
lation systems that I know of is that REF-
TEX emphasises the context, whereas other
systems rely on bilingual dictionaries
containing translations (sometimes uncom-
mented) and possibly definitions or ex-
planatory remarks.
The system was first implemented on a
CDC mainframe installation, but has now
been converted to an IBM XT-microcomputer.
The primary scope of the program is to
provide a supplemental aid for human
translators.
The principles of REFTEX
The name of the system, REFTEX, is an
acronym for reference text. Its main cha-
racteristics can be summarised as follows:
The system is meant to be used when the
translator comes across some word or word
compound that cannot be looked up in a
dictionary or the translations of which
do not seem relevant in the context of
the actual translation. The translator
can then have recourse to texts that have
already been translated, in order to try
to retrieve the wanted word(s) and its/
their translation(s). Such texts exist in
an original (source language) version and
one or more translated (target language)
versions. In REFTEX, such texts are de-
signated reference texts. During execu-
tion of the program, the program will ac-
cess passages (concordances) of the ori-
ginal text that contain the word and the
equivalent passages of (one of) the trans-
lated versions. The translator will then
decide if the translation contained in the
target language version is useful in the
actual translation.
It is an interactive, screen-oriented
system that can be used by a translator
during the translation process. In the
present version, the text to be transla-
ted and its translation are supposed to
exist independently on paper, but nothing
prevents the implementation of an integra-
ted version using windows (cf. last sec-
tion).
REFTEX can thus be conceived of as a
computerised combination of bilingual con-
cordances used in philology (usually on
ancient texts) and the manual use of trans-
lated text as an aid for the translator.
But in contrast to traditional concordance
making, the project does not aim at pro-
ducing a finished product of the works of
an author, but at supplying the translator
with an ad hoc tool.

The REFTEX system
REFTEX has been implemented as a pro-
gram package of two independent programs:
ARBORAL and REFTEX.
The former uses one or more slightly
pre-edited reference texts as input and
transforms each into an equivalent data
structure that contains both the original
information (thus permitting a reconstruc-
tion of the original text) and some new
information which facilitates the search-
ing of words in the text and the concor-
dance making.
The data structure is organised as two
records. The first one contains a node or
an index for each different word of the
text together with some satellite informa-
tion: absolute word frequencies and point-
ers to the first occurrence of the word.
The second record is a list structure con-
taining a reference for each individual
word of the reference text to its position
in the first record, and pointers to pos-
sibly following occurrences of the word
and to the beginning of the paragraph
(concordance) that contains the word.
Once the finished data structure has
been established, the program writes it on
a file, from where it can be accessed by
the main program REFTEX.
The pre-editing of the reference text
that was mentioned above consists of the
insertion in the source text of period
markers (the number sign: #) together with
a number that uneqivocally identifies each
passage. A passage normally consists of
one period, possibly two. Then, parallel
period markers and numbers are inserted
into the target text(s) to ensure the re-
trieval of parallel extracts (concordances)
of the source and target texts. If this
pre-editing were not carried out, it would
not be possible to extract parallel pas-
sages, if the source and target languages
involved are structurally different in re-
spect to modes of expression. And even for
closely related languages such as the Scan-
dinavian languages, this would probably be
the case.
REFTEX is the part of the program pack-
age that will be used by the translator
during the process of translation.
Program execution starts by asking the
translator to key in names of the pair of
reference texts he/she wants to use for
solving the problems of the actual trans-
lation. The program then asks for the first
key word to be searched in the reference
text, whose equivalents the translator
wants to know. If the reference source text
contains that word, the program will print
out the passage containing the first occur-
rence of the&apos;word together with the equi-
valent passage of the target language ver-
sion. On the basis of his world knowledge
(pragmatics) and knowledge of the two lan-
guages involved, the translator now has to
decide whether the source language passage
is sufficiently similar to the context of
the actual translation to permit reusing
the translation contained in the target
language passage. The decision of course
depends on the quality of the translated
reference text and relies on the transla-
tor&apos;s ability to detect possible errors.
If the first bilingual concordance does
not contain an acceptable translation, the
translator can &amp;quot;scroll&amp;quot; to the following
occurrence(s), until he finds an adequate
translation or the reference text is ex-
hausted. If either the word does not exist
in the reference text or it does not have
appropriate translations, it will be saved
in a special array for non-retrieved words
and can be searched in another reference
text, after the translator has finished
the list of words or expressions that he
wants to look up. In case that words have
been saved in this array, the program will
ask for another pair of reference texts.
Supposing that they are available, the
program will try to retrieve passages con-
taining the words that were saved.
An additional feature of REFTEX is a
semi-automatic routine that enables the
program to retrieve inflected forms of a
word, for instance feminine and/or plural
forms as in the Spanish word espaMol -
espaMola, espanoles, espaMolas. The rou-
tine solely relies on formal characteris-
tics of words (such as word endings) and
not on semantic or other markers that
would imply some sort of &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot;
of the word (as is the case in many gram-
mars). For the time being, the routine has
been implemented for regular nouns, ad-
jectives, verbs and participles in French
and Spanish.
Computational concordance making
Given that the REFTEX-approach relies
on a bilingual concordance, this section
will briefly introduce two of the problems
this causes: word-form diffusion and homo-
form-insensitivity. The former problem re-
flects the wish to group together diffe-
rent inflected forms of the same word. The
solution proposed in REFTEX is to depart
from the primary form and consequently ge-
nerate inflected forms automatically, when
regular and manually, when irregular.
The latter problem reflects the homo-
graph or polysemy problem. To solve this
problem completely, one would need either
a sort of tagging (requiring extensive
pre-editing) or some semantic analyzer.
Neither of these solutions has been chosen
in the REFTEX-approach. A &amp;quot;pragmatic&amp;quot; so-
lution, based on the immediate context,
has been developed, thus reducing the a-
mount of superfluous information or &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot;.

An example will illustrate its function:
The French word &amp;quot;application&amp;quot; has multiple
meanings, and may in some texts be quite
frequent. If the key word to be looked up
is the &apos;compound preposition &amp;quot;en application
de&amp;quot;, the word takes on yet another meaning.
In order to narrow the search field, REFTEX
permits the translator to look for the word
&amp;quot;application&amp;quot; together with &amp;quot;en&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;de&amp;quot;.
In this way, a lot of, though not all,
irrelevant information will be excluded.
Methodological considerations
The use of bilingual concordances im-
plies that REFTEX can be characterised as
a context-oriented translation aid in op-
position to the dictionary-oriented ap-
proach that most machine-aided systems rely
on.
These two approaches both possess weak-
nesses. The problem of a context-oriented
approach can be restated as the question
of how reliable the translation of the re-
ference source text is, whereas the pro-
blem of a dictionary-oriented approach may
be the difficulties of defining precisely
the words of a language (cf. Wittgenstein).
In fact, the difference between the two ap-
proaches comes down to the question of
whether words possess an independent mean-
ing, defined at the &amp;quot;langue&amp;quot;-level or their
meaning is influenced by the actual contex-
tual use of the words, the &amp;quot;parole&amp;quot;-level.
The difference between the two approach-
es may be illustrated by a well-known ex-
ample from the MT-literature: the English
verb &amp;quot;to know&amp;quot;, which is rendered in many
European languages by two different verbs.
Does this verb have two distinct meanings
which the lexicographer can account for or
would it be preferable to let the transla-
tor decide the relevant equivalent on the
basis of a series of bilingually concorded
examples? A similar example would be the
German word &amp;quot;Schlagsahne&amp;quot; which is rendered
into Danish by two different words: piske-
flade (cream) and flodeskum (whipped cream).
The strength of a bilingual dictionary
approach is of course its ability in many
cases to convey to the user a fairly good
idea of the meaning of a word in another
language.
The strength of an context-oriented ap-
proach is its ability to help deciding
(just) which among a number of different
proposals should be retained for the cur-
rent translation. And, needless to say, in
some situations, it will certainly be pos-
sible to combine the two approaches in or-
der to make the best out of each.
The belief that the linguistic context
contributes to determining the meaning of
words is of course implied in the use of a
context-oriented approach. Supposing that
this holds true, another aspect of the ap-
proach is to determine whether the impact
of the context is equally strong for any
sub-vocabulary. In the negative, this would
mean that a context-related approach would
be less relevant in some cases.
No conclusive answer has been given to
that question, but it seems fairly reason-
able to suppose that the more specialised
the vocabulary is the less the meaning of
the word is influenced by the context. In
such cases, the utility of the REFTEX ap-
proach may be the possibility to retrieve
newly coined compounds that have not yet
been lexicalised, or &amp;quot;loose&amp;quot; collocations
that never appear in dictionaries.
Alternative applications
The primary scope of the program - as
was stated in the introduction - is to
provide a supplemental aid for human trans-
lators. In that respect, it could probably
become an integrated part of a translator&apos;s
work bench Or amanuensis (Kay, 1980), en-
abling the translator to carry out all
parts (translation, dictionary and refe-
rence text look-ups, text processing) of
the translation process. This part of the
project has not been completed.
A context-oriented approach may also be
an appropriate tool for lexicographers and
other researchers because it can provide
the &amp;quot;raw material&amp;quot; for syntactic investi-
gations as well. The system might thus
prove useful for making &amp;quot;translation rules&amp;quot;,
i.e. rules stating how to translate syn-
tactic phenomena from one language into
another.
