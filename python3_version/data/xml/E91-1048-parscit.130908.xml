The lexical transfer phase is the most crucial
step in MT because most of difficult problems are
caused by lexical differences between two
languages. In order to treat lexical issues systemati-
cally in transfer-based MT systems, we introduce
the concept of bilingual-sings which are defined by
pairs of equivalent monolingual signs. The bil-
ingual signs not only relate the local linguistic
structures of two languages but also play a central
role in connecting the linguistic processes of transla-
tion with knowledge based inferences. We also
show that they can be effectively used to formulate
appropriate questions for disambiguating &amp;quot;transfer
ambiguities&amp;quot;, which is crucial in interactive MT sys-
tems.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997741613636364">
&apos;Lexical Transfer&apos; has always been one of the
main sources of problems in Machine Translation
(MT)[Melby, 1986][Nirenburg, 1988].
Research in transfer-based MT systems has
focussed on discovering an appropriate level of
linguistic description for translation, at which we
can specify &apos;translation relations&apos;, (or transfer rules)
in a simple manner. However, lexical differences
between languages have caused problems in this
attempt. Besides structural changes caused by lexi-
cal transfer, selecting appropriate translations of
source lexical items has been one of the hardest
problems in MT.
Because languages have their own ways of
reflecting the structure of the world in their lexi-
cons, and the process of lexicalization is more or
less arbitrary, bilingual knowledge about lexical
correspondences is highly dependent on language
pairs and individual words. We have to prepare a
framework in which such idiosyncratic bilingual
knowledge about lexical items can be systemati-
cally accumulated.
Our approach in this paper follows the general
trend in computational linguistics which emphasizes
the role of the lexicon in linguistic theory. In partic-
ular, our idea of bilingual signs shares a common
intuition with [Beaven, 19881 and [Whitelock,
1988]. As with their proposal, we too specify local
structural correspondences between two languages in
bilingual lexicons.
Unlike former approaches, however, we expli-
citly define bilingual signs and use them as predi-
cates in logical formulae (bilingual pivot expres-
sions). Bilingual signs in our framework not only
link the local linguistic structures of two languages
where the corresponding two monolingual signs
appear, but also, by behaving as logical predicates,
they connect linguistic-based processes in MT with
inference processes. Complicated structural
changes, which are often required in translation of
remote language pairs like English and Japanese, are
captured by logical inferences [Tsujii, 1990].
The framework has the following advantages
over conventional methods.

2. Bilingual signs as logical predicates and their
definition
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999196">
The basic idea of bilingual signs is simple.
Instead of using predicates corresponding directly to
surface words, we use bilingual pairs of lexical
items as predicates. That is, we use
[RUN:JIKKOOSURU] and [RUN:UN&apos;EISURU] as
basic predicates expressing the meanings of run in
the following sentences.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.929375">
(1) The teacher runs the program.
(2) The teacher runs the company.
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.559063">
Corresponding to the obvious meaning
difference of run in (1) and (2), we have to use
different surface verbs in Japanese, &amp;quot;jikkoosuru&amp;quot; for
(1) and &amp;quot;un&apos;eisuru&amp;quot; for (2). The bilingual sign
[RUN:JIKKOOSLJRU] is a predicate which
expresses the truth condition which an event should
satisfy in order to be described by run in English
and jikkoosuru in Japanese. Note that
[RUN:JIKKOOSURU] expresses not only one
disambiguated sense of run but also one disambi-

<bodyText confidence="0.832627625">
guated sense of the Japanese verb jikkoasurul.
Our system is a conventional transfer based
MT system where the monolingual analysis and
transfer phases are executed separately. The
analysis phase of English produces the following
schema of logical formulae (3) as the description of
(1). (For simplicity, we ignore articles, quantifiers,
etc.)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.893151">
(3) ([RUN:?1](e) &amp; ARG1(e,x) &amp; ARG2(e,y)
&amp; [TEACHER:?2](x) &amp; [PROGRAM:?3](y))
</equation>
<listItem confidence="0.74879525">
(3) is not a logical formula in the ordinary sense but
a schema which represents a set of possible formu-
lae. [RUN:?!] is a predicate schema, and by bind-
ing the variable IF to a specific Japanese verb, we

<bodyText confidence="0.9986363">
get a specific predicate such as
[RUN:JIKKOOSURU], [RUN:UN&apos;EISURU], etc.
The transfer phase is taken to be a phase which
identifies appropriate predicates in a schema of logi-
cal formulae produced by the analysis phase.
As in LFG [Kaplan, 1982], we assume that
semantic representations (logical forms) are related
lexically with a certain level of linguistic descrip-
tions. Because a bilingual sign is defined by two
languages (here English and Japanese), the two rela-
tionships of (logical form &lt;---&gt; English) and (logical
form &lt;---4 Japanese) are specified in the same place.
In order to avoid further complications caused by
changes of grammatical functions (passive construc-
tions, etc.), we use thematic role representations as
linguistic descriptions in the definitions of bilingual
signs.
The following definition shows the predicate
[RUN:UN&apos;EISUR&apos;U] has arity two (argl and arg2)
and the arguments have sortal restrictions.

<equation confidence="0.9605809">

This example is rather simple, since local
linguistic structures in both languages are the same.
That is, the agent and the object in English
correspond to the constituents with the same

including run, carry out, execute, implement, practice, etc.

lest description block (shown by braces { }&apos;) which con-
tains the description block in which the &apos;I&apos; appears.
thematic roles. Note that these correspondences are
expressed through argl and arg2 of the defined
predicate. However, many cases have been observed
where lexical transfer causes structural changes. It
is also the case that objects or events describable by
single words in one language are described by
, phrases or clauses in other languages (see section 3).
We may expect that classes of objects/events
which can be expressed by single words in one
language correspond to natural classes of
objects/events, the classes whose truth conditions are
naturally captured by single predicates in logical
forms. Therefore, we prepare single bilingual signs
for expressing their truth conditions if at least one
of the languages has lexical items [Emele, 1990].
That is, we define a single bilingual sign which
corresponds to a complex linguistic object in one
language, if the other language expresses the same
&amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; by a single word.
As [Sadler, 1990] pointed out, compared with
other methods using arbitrary predicates in meaning
representation, our method is well-motivated in
selecting basic predicates. In fact, the required
fineness of distinction of word senses depends
highly on the target language (source words are
translationally ambiguous [Tsujii, 1988]). We can
expect the set of bilingually defined predicates to
have appropriate, at least necessary if not sufficient,
granularity of the semantic domains for translation
of the two given languages.
Furthermore, we can use logical formulae to
specify mutual relationships among bilingual signs,
which means that we can specify explicitly &apos;logical&apos;
relationships among lexical transfer rules (see sec-
tion 4).
3. Complex structural changes â€” complex bil-
ingual signs
The following show how our framework treats
structural changes caused by lexical correspon-
dences.

A Japanese verb nuru, for example, is
translated as paint, varnish, spread (bread with
butter), apply (paint) etc., depending on the material
being applied. Some of the English verbs (paint,
varnish, etc.) include the objects (of the Japanese) in
their meaning. For example, the structural change
between (6a) and (6b) is treated by the definition
(7).

penki-wo nuru in Japanese corresponds to the

predicate as a basic unit of semantic representation.

[C] Head switching
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992468857142857">
One of the well-known examples is the
correspondence between the English verb like and
the Dutch adverb graag (which roughly corresponds
to pleasantly in English). The same kind of
phenomena has often been observed in translation
between English and Japanese.
The event expressed by the verb manage (in
the usage of manage to do something) is captured
by an adverb nantoka (&apos;somehow or other&apos; or &apos;with
great effort&apos; in English) in Japanese. The adverb is
used to modify the event expressed as an infinitive
clause in English.
The correspondence between (8a) and (8b) is
captured by the definition (9).

In this example, though the adverb nantoka is not
the head of the Japanese deep case description
(&apos;jpn&apos;), it is converted into the predicate
[MANAGE:NANTOKA] in the logical formula, and
the rest of the `jpn&apos; description into arg2.
[Kaplan, 1989] proposed two ways of treating
such head-switching phenomena, one monolingual
and the other bilingual. Our treatment in this paper
is basically bilingual in the sense that the non-head
construction in Japanese is directly related with the
English construction in which the corresponding ele-
ment is expressed as the head. However, if we deem
the logical level of representation a separate, more
abstract but mono-lingual level of representation,
then our method is quite close to the mono-lingual
treatment suggested by [Zajac, 1990]. Our conten-
tion is that such an abstract level of representation is
hard to justify by purely mono-lingual considera-
tions but only possible by bilingual (or multi-
lingual) considerations.

Sort-subsort relationships among object-sorts
such as `[TEACHER:SENSEI] is a

tional logic by implications. However, logical impli-
cations express various ontologically different rela-
tionships among formulae, which have to be treated
differently in translation. Sortal relationships such
as these are of special importance in translation,
because they give alternative linguistic means of
describing the same events/objects (a supersort gives
a more vague, less specific description than the
subsort). We explicitly indicate that a given implica-
tion expresses a sortal relationship, as follows.
3 We introduce a new notation. &apos;{&lt;1 arg2&gt;, lady :=

our treatment of &apos;nantoka&apos; is essentially the same as the
treatment of &apos;graag&apos; in the MiN1o2 formalism [van Noord,
19901 so that it has the same defect. That is, it cannot cope
with cases where more than two words which require &apos;rais-

The English verb wear is a well-known exam-
ple of a translationally ambiguous word when it is
translated into Japanese. It can be translated into
several different verbs including haku Near
shoes&apos;), kaburu Near a hat&apos;), kdkeru Near specta-
cles&apos;), kiru Near clothes&apos;), etc., depending on what
is worn. While we have a complex expression mini-
tsukeru (mi â€” body, ni particle, tsukeru â€” put on) in
Japanese which preserves almost the same vague-
ness as wear, to use this as the translation of wear
leads to an awkward translation if the material to be
worn belongs to a specific sort. kutsu(shoes)-wo
mini-tsukeru, for example, tends to be understood
as &amp;quot;the shoes are worn on a non-standard of the
body (not on the feet)&amp;quot;.

[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUICERU] and if the
argument-2 of the event belongs to the sort
[SHOES:KUTSU], then the event also belongs
to [WEAR:HAKU].
All the event-sorts related with wear in the

role). But this continuity of argument structures
through sorts is not necessarily guaranteed. A sort
can have multiple supersorts and so the continuity
of argument structures from different supersorts may
conflict with each other. Furthermore, it is some-
times the case that the arities of events change
between a sort and its subsorts. For example, sup-
pose that we have two event sorts [APPLY:NURU]
(this event-sort corresponds to the usage of apply in
apply glue/paint to ...) and [PAINT:PENKI-WO-
NURU], and that we define the latter as a subsort of
the former. Then, one of the arguments in the super-
sort [APPLY:NURU] is lexically included in the
subsoil [PAINT:PENIU-WO-NURU] so that these
two sorts basically have different arities. The

S. Sketch of the Transfer Phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971477">
The transfer phase is divided into three sub-
phases as follows.
(a) Transforming from thematic role structures of
source sentences into schema of logical
formulae(like (3))
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.948449">
- 278 -
(b) Determining logical formulae by
descending/ascending sort hierarchies: during
this phase, inferences based on knowledge are
made, and questions are asked to users, if
necessary.
(c) Transforming from logical formulae to
thematic role structures in the target.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995690915254238">
All of these steps are performed by referring
to the definitions of bilingual signs.
We can index each bilingual sign by the sur-
face word whose &apos;meaning&apos; is expressed by the
sign. Roughly speaking, a word indexing a bil-
ingual sign is either the word which appears as head
in the linguistic form definitions or the word which
is the value in a feature marked by &apos;/&apos; (like nantoka
in the example [MANAGE:NANTOKA]).
Step (a) in the above is a rather straightfor-
ward process which can be recursively performed
through thematic structures. At each recursion level,
the system
identifies the (semantic) head of the level,
retrieves the vaguest possible bilingual signs
for the head word
transforms the local structures governed by
the head word according to the definition of
the bilingual signs retrieved at (ii).
Because a predicate schema of a word may
have several possible vaguest sorts, step (a) pro-
duces several formulae which step (b) tries to
transform into more appropriate formulae. The
processes of descending in sort hierarchies (disambi-
guation processes necessary for translation) are per-
formed for different predicate schemata simultane-
ously (for verbs and nouns which are related to each
other).
Ascending the hierarchies is also required,
because the system has to instantiate all the predi-
cate schemata contained in formula, and constraints
imposed by different predicates in a schema of for-
mulae may conflict with each other. It may also
happen that there are no corresponding target lexi-
cal items for source items. In these cases, the sys-
tem has to loosen constraints by ascending hierar-
chies. Therefore, step (b) is a kind of relaxation
process which tries to find the most accurate solu-
tions satisfying all constraints. During this process,
some general inference mechanisms may be invoked
to infer necessary information for navigating in
hierarchies and, if necessary, questions will be
posed to human users.
[Estival, 1990] also proposed using a partial
order of transfer rules to choose preferred transla-
tions or prevent less preferred translations from
being generated. He assumes that such a partial
order of rules can be automatically computed in
terms of specificities of conditions on individual
transfer rules. We also use a partial order of rules
(in our case, lexical transfer rules) to choose transla-
tions, but the specificity relationships in our system
are concerned with lexical semantics and are not
automatically computed but defined externally by a
human based on his/her bilingual intuition. These
externally imposed specificity (sort-subsort) rela-
tionships also define possible paraphrasing and are
effectively used to disambiguate transfer ambiguities
by dialogue.

Because of the explicitness of mutual relation-
ships in the sort hierarchies, we can easily express
an event (or object) in diversified ways in both
languages. This paraphrasing facility is very useful
for forming and posing appropriate questions during
the transfer phase to monolingual users of the
source language.

As we have already seen, run can be translated into

directly transformed into Japanese expressions by
using hashiraseru. However, the direct translation is
sometimes awkward if more specific lexical items
exist.
The system tries to descend in the hierarchy.
In this example, there are two candidates:
[RUN:JIKICOOSURU] and [RUN:UN&apos;EISURU].
Three ways of disambiguation by questions are pos-
sible : verbalize sort restrictions on arguments
directly (ex: (16)), use the other event-sorts which
are not shared by both sorts such as (17), and use
these two strategies (ex: (18)).

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989450763157894">
In this paper, we have shown that
(a) our idea of bilingual signs is useful for
representing the relations among lexical
transfer rules which in traditional systems
- 279 -
have not been captured explicitly. By using
these relationships, we can pose appropriate
questions to the user for disambiguation.
(b) transfer rules which are written in our frame-
work are basically reversible.
(c) the bilingual signs connect the linguistic forms
of two languages and general knowledge
about events/objects denoted by them
(knowledge about sort hierarchies is the sim-
plest example of this type of knowledge) in a
natural way.
In our future research, we have to make it
clear to what extent we can treat structural changes
by bilingual signs, and on the other hand, to what
extent global structural changes beyond the local
restructuring by bilingual signs are necessary. We
think at present that most of the global structural
changes in conventional transfer systems, though
necessary for natural translations, actually change
the &amp;quot;meanings&amp;quot; of source sentences and should be
treated by inference mechanisms external to the
&amp;quot;linguistic&amp;quot; processing in translation. Though we
only treat the predicates and arguments of bilingual
signs, we would have to treat adjuncts as well in
order to translate a whole sentence. This is related
to how to control the rule application and how to
ensure that all the parts of the source structure are
processed. The method of formulating questions for
disambiguation is still incomplete, though our
method seems promising. We have to investigate
what sorts of paraphrasing are really helpful for
making bilingual ambiguities obvious to monol-
ingual users.

<abstract confidence="0.99072075">The lexical transfer phase is the most crucial step in MT because most of difficult problems are caused by lexical differences between two languages. In order to treat lexical issues systematically in transfer-based MT systems, we introduce the concept of bilingual-sings which are defined by pairs of equivalent monolingual signs. The bilingual signs not only relate the local linguistic structures of two languages but also play a central role in connecting the linguistic processes of translation with knowledge based inferences. We also show that they can be effectively used to formulate appropriate questions for disambiguating &amp;quot;transfer ambiguities&amp;quot;, which is crucial in interactive MT systems.</abstract>
