This volume is the official record of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Meeting of
the Association for Computational Linguistics. It contains abstracts for the tu-
torials and panels as well as the texts of the presented papers.
Such a meeting can be a success only through the efforts of a large number of
people. We are first indebted to the very many authors who submitted papers.
While the great majority of them reported important work, only a third could be
included in the program. We are also indebted to the members of the Program
Committee who helped make the difficult decisions:

In addition, much credit goes to Bruce W. Ballard who organized the tutorial
sessions and to Ralph Grishman and Cecile Paris who organized the demonstra-
tions and exhibits.
On administrative matters, Don Walker published the Call for Papers and
this Proceedings, sent out the advertisements and registration packets, and han-
dled countless other problems that most of us never knew existed. Kathy
McKeown and Cecile Paris were in charge of the huge task of local arrangements.
I am also grateful to the Department of Computer Science at Duke University
which provided extensive secretarial support for my correspondence and organiza-
tional activities.
