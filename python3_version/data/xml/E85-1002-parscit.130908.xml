ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.99992175">
It has traditionally been assumed that Natural
Language uses explicit quantifier expressions
(such as &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;most&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;) for the
purpose of quantification. We argue that expressi-
ons of the first type are comparatively rare in
real world Natural Language sentences, and that
the latter (articles) cannot be considered stra-
ightforward quantifiers in the first place. How-
ever, practically all applications of Natural
Language Processing require sentences to be
quantified unambiguously. We list a few possible
(syntactical, semantical, and &amp;quot;pragmatical&amp;quot;) sour-
ces of &amp;quot;implicit&amp;quot; quantifications&apos; information in
Natural Language; they combine in sometimes
intricate ways to give a sentence a (more or less)
unambiguous quantification.

The subject of the present paper is not strictly
one of Computational Linguistics. Neither does it
outline a working computer program, nor investi-
gate a linguistic problem with the help of compu-
tational methods. Although the subject may be
purely linguistic in character it is particularly
relevant to Computational Linguistics. Moreover it
seems to have been ignored by most non-computa-
tional linguists.
Computational as well as non-computational
linguists agree that we have to represent Natural
Language sentences as quantified logical senten-
ces, either in a graphical variant of logic such as
semantic networks, or in some other form of
logic. However, non-computational linguists do
not very often use real-world examples in their
investigations; they create their own example sen-
tences to make a certain point. Everything which
is not in the primary focus of their interest is
made so explicit as to become largely self-expla-
natory. They tend, for instance, to create only
sentences where quantification is explicit. Com-
putational linguists, on the other hand, have to
use real world texts. They have to face certain
nasty facts of life which they, too, would prefer
to ignore. One of them concerns the way in which
Natural Language quantifies.

1.2 THE TRADITIONAL POINT OF VIEW:
QUANTIFIERS ARE EXPLICIT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999160705882353">
Traditionally it has almost always been assumed
that quantification is expressed in Natural Langu-
age by explicit means. The most traditional view
had it that simple surface words correspond one-
to-one to the two classical quantifiers: &amp;quot;every&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; stand for the universal quantifier,
&amp;quot;some&amp;quot; for the existential quantifier:
every man is mortal
some gods are mortal
However, it has long been known that the over-
whelming majority of real world sentences simply
don&apos;t contain any of those explicit simple quanti-
fier words. 1 For this reason (among others) Bar-
wise and Cooper (1981) suggested that the con-
cept of simple quantifiers should be extended to
the concept of - generalised quantifiers. They
should take care of simple cases such as most men
as well as of very complicated ones such as more
than half of John&apos;s arrows. A generalised quanti-
fer consists, in English, of a determiner (such as
&amp;quot;most&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;more than half of&amp;quot;) and a set expres-
sion in the form of a noun phrase (such as &amp;quot;men&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;John&apos;s arrows&amp;quot;). Determiners are some,
every, each, all, both, no, neither, many, few,
most, a few, one, etc. However, even now a
sizeable majority of sentences in any real world
text would appear to lack quantification. That&apos;s
why the most obvious determiners, viz, the and
a (plus zero) have to be included in this list.
But that&apos;s also where a new set of problems origi-
nates. Articles have always caused problems
when treated as quantifiers, and recently these
problems have become increasingly • more difficult
to ignore (Kamp 1981).

1.3 PROBLEMS WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF
ARTICLES AS QUANTIFIERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993866">
Again we start with the most traditional view of
the question how articles could be interpreted as
quantifiers. It saw both definite and indefinite
articles as existential quantifiers, with some addi-
tional information in the case of the definite
article. It was primarily this &amp;quot;additional informa-
tion&amp;quot; which caused much discussion.
1 or verb phrases such as &amp;quot;there is&amp;quot; - quite pos-
sibly the only &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; existential quantifier
English has.

1.3.1 Is the Definite Article an Existential
Quantifier?
Russell, in his classical analysis of the definite
article (1905), maintained that a sentence such as
1) The President of France is bald
should be interpreted as follows
</note>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.837034666666667" genericHeader="method">
EXISTS X:(president_of_france(X) AND
NOT(EXISTS Y:(president_of_france(Y)
AND NOT(X=Y))) AND bald(X) )
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972449481481482">
Here the &amp;quot;additional information&amp;quot; is given in the
universal statement that X is the one and only
President of France. Strawson (1950) pointed out
that sentences such as 2
2) The king of France is bald
would simply be false irrespective of whether a)
there was exactly one king of France but he was
not bald, b) there was no king of France to
begin with, or c) there were several kings of
France. Our intuition tells us that in case a)
sentence 2 would certainly be &amp;quot;simply false&amp;quot; but
In cases b) and c) it would be false &amp;quot;in a diffe-
rent way&amp;quot;. Strawson argued that Russell hadn&apos;t
made the distinction between a sentence as such
and the statement made by the use of a sentence.
Sentences such as example 2, uttered at the pre-
sent time, and under condition a), were non-eva-
luable (not Strawson&apos;s term) rather than false.
They may be evaluable, and even true, at other
points in time (or space, we might add). A defi-
nite noun phrase, then, does not assert the exi-
stence of some object, it only refers to it, and in
doing so it presupposes its existence. In the same
sense it doesn&apos;t assert the uniqueness of the
object referred to, either, it only presupposes it.
Unfulfilled presuppositions don&apos;t make sentences
false, they make them • non-evaluable, i.e. the
question of whether they are true or false doesn&apos;t
arise. Whether the presuppositions of such a
sentence are fulfilled depends on the concrete
circumstances, given by the context.
Subsequently it was noticed that Strawson&apos;s
analysis gave no satisfactory explanantion for
cases such as 3, 4 and 5:
3) The unicorn is a mythical creature.
4) The lion is a dangerous animal.
5) The dog is barking.
In 3 we certainly don&apos;t presuppose the existence of
unicorns, but the sentence makes nevertheless
perfect sense. 4 is actually the same case
although the fact that lions do exist may obscure
this fact at first. We obviously presuppose the
existence of the concept of unicorns and lions in
the listener&apos;s mind, but not the existence of these
animals in the real world.
Example 5 shows that definite noun phrases
don&apos;t presuppose uniqueness of real objects,
either. 5 makes perfect sense, in the appropriate
context, but nobody would presuppose that there
is only one dog in the world. The suggestion
that we could temporarily restrict the universe of
discourse to the point that it contains only one
dog, precisely the one that is barking, is hardly
very convincing on intuitive grounds alone, and
furthermore McCawley (1981:265) pointed out that
it would make sentences 6 and 6a equivalent,
which they definitely are not.
6) The dog likes all dogs.
6a) The dog likes itself.
It might be more appropriate to talk about uni-
queness in a contextual domain (McCawley
1981:265, expanding on Karttunen 1976; also Plat-
teau 1980, Kamp 1981, Frey/Reyle 1983) whose
members are created by the context, and are not
necessarily elementary real world objects (as in
the universe of discourse) but can be sets of real
objects, or possibly even purely notional objects
such as concepts.
As the problems of definite reference are
treated in-depth elsewhere in this volume
(Berry-Rogghe) we will restrict ourselves to this
very sketchy outline of the problem. The main
point in this context is that any notion of the
definite article having an existential quantifier as
one of its components has evaporated along the
way from Russell&apos;s analysis to contemporary
views. Without additional sources of quantification
a considerable proportion of real world sentences
would now appear to be merely un-quantified,
meaningless, expressions, which they certainly
aren&apos;t. But it gets even worse.

1.3.2 Is the Indefinite Article an Existential
Quantifier?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99683925">
The indefinite article seems, on the surface, to
cause much less trouble than the definite article.
Its interpretation as an existential quantifier
always looked quite straightforward. However, it
was noticed (Kamp 1981) that indefinite articles
sometimes must be represented as universal quan-
tifiers. Prominent among these cases are the so-
called donkey sentences, exemplified by sentences
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.583115">
7 and 8.
7) If Pedro owns a donkey he is rich.
8) If Pedro owns a donkey he beats it.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.957628">
The traditional, and most natural, representation
of 7 is 7a

<bodyText confidence="0.999979666666667">
where the top-most syntactic connector of the
English sentence, i.e. the conjunction &amp;quot;if&amp;quot;, cor-
responds to the top-most connector of the logical
form, i.e. the implication. However, if we apply
the same schema mechanically to example 8 it will
produce the non-sentence 8a:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.993949" genericHeader="method">
8a) EXISTS X: (donkey(X) AND owns(pedro,X))
IMPLIES beats(pedro,X).
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99954425">
This is not a logical sentence because the variable
in the consequent is outside the scope of the
existential quantifier and remains unbound. 8
must therefore be represented as 8b
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.901741" genericHeader="method">
8b) ALL X: ((donkey(X) AND owns(pedro, X))

<bodyText confidence="0.9997455">
where the indefinite article is now represented as
a universal quantifier. Now we are in the most
unsatisfactory situation that we have to represent
two syntactically very similar surface sentences
by two radically different logical sentences, and
that the same noun phrase has to be mapped into

an existential quantifier one time, into a universal
quantifier another time.
If we try to consistently represent indefinite
articles as universal quantifiers we get 7b as
representation for 7

IMPLIES rich(pedro)) .
which is indeed logically equivalent to 7a, but on
purely formal grounds. The scope has been artifi-
cially extended to span over terms without any
variables, which certainly runs very much against
our intuition about the meaning of the original
sentence. The conclusion cannot be avoided that
even the seemingly innocuous indefinite article
cannot be represented as a straightforward exi-
stential quantifier.

1.4 COUNTEREXAMPLES: MOST QUAN it.RS

<bodyText confidence="0.999848428571429">
However, if articles are no longer available as
explicit quantifiers we are in real trouble: Either
all those Natural Language declarative sentences
that do not contain any of the explicit quantifier
expressions (&amp;quot;most&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;some&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;there is&amp;quot; etc.)
cannot be represented as logical sentences at all
for their lack of quantification, or else we have
to find sources of quantificational information
other than explicit quantifier expressions. Now, if
we look at sentences 9 to 14 we have to admit a)
that they are reasonably normal sentences, b)
that they contain no explicit quantifier expressi-
ons, and c) that our intuition tells us neverthe-
less that they are unambiguously quantified.

We think, therefore, and try to show in this
paper, that there must be many more sources of
quantificational information in NL than just the
traditional, explicit, cases. But the information is
scattered over whole sentences, or even para-
graphs, and must be combined to get a (more or
less) reliable quantification for a sentence.
This is a rather unattractive state of affairs:
Traditionally, it was Assumed that at least the
form of quantifiers in NL sentences was unproble-
matical, and that we could concentrate right away
on the questions of their scope, monotonicity
etc., difficult enough in their own right. If our
diagnosis is correct, this is not so. In the rest of
the paper we will try to list some of the other
possible sources of quantificational information in
NL. None of them will be of the &amp;quot;on/off&amp;quot;-variety;
they are all more like interacting forces resulting
in a net force tipping the balance one way -or the
other. We will go through all the examples listed
above, considering slightly more complex cases as
we go along, and try to show how different these
seemingly similar examples really are as far as
their quantification is concerned.

2.1.1 Verbal Form
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925">
The most important way to determine the quantifi-
cation of a sentence by syntactic means is
through the choice of the verb form. This beco-
mes particularly clear when we look at examples 9
to 10a. They are striking cases in that 9 is a
prototypical case of an assertion about an indivi-
dual event and 10 and 10a are equally prototypi-
cal universal rules. However, it could be argued
that the mass noun used (&amp;quot;meat&amp;quot;) unnecessarily
complicates the situation. So let&apos;s replace them
with the perfectly regular examples 15 to 18.2
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.968742571428571">
15) A text editor makes modifications to a text
file.
16) A text editor is making modifications to a
text file.
17) A text editor made modifications to a text file.
18) A text editor has made modifications to
a text file.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950444444445">
In example 15 we say that a text editor makes
modifications to a text file in general, almost by
definition. We might read this sentence in a
system manual. In 16 to 18 we say, on the other
hand, that there is, or was, a case of a text
editor making modifications to a text file. These
remarks might be made by a system operator,
watching his screen. In 16 to 18 we express, of
course, additional information about the temporal
relationships involved, but we will ignore them in
the present context.3 Sweeping under the carpet
the question of how we would have to represent
the sentence predicate we could, as a very first
approximation, represent the example with the
verb in the present tense, 15, as 15a and the
examples with verbs in either the past tense or in
the perfective or progressive aspect, 16 through
18, as 16a:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.993984" genericHeader="method">
15a) ALL T:(text_editor(T)
IMPLIES makes_modifications_...(T))
16a) EXISTS T:(text_editor(T)
AND makes_modifications_...(T)).
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9451076">
We must qualify these statements at once.
1. In many cases the future tense is prefer-
red over the present tense for the kind of
general statements given in example 15. 19
Is definitely more acceptable than 20:

<listItem confidence="0.997212">

will ,for reasons of simplicity, use only singular
examples.
Here, and in all the other examples used, the
Indefinite singular could be replaced by the
plural without any change in quantification. We
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992866">
10

<bodyText confidence="0.978413162162162">
Dynamic verbs, such as &amp;quot;to stroke&amp;quot;, seem
to call for the future tense, whereas static
verbs, such as &amp;quot;to respect&amp;quot;, seem to go
better with the present tense. The reason
for this seems to be that static verbs do
not require the future tense to express
their permanent validity, as their very
meaning as verbs of disposition etc.
already conveys this connotation. Many
other verbs go either with the present or
with the future tense: &amp;quot;Oil floats on
water&amp;quot; is as acceptable as &amp;quot;Oil will float on
water&amp;quot;.
2. The past tense can express a universally
quantified assertion, as in &amp;quot;A student read
books when I was young&amp;quot;, contrary to
what we said above. However, for this
universal quantification to be possible the
sentence requires a spatial or temporal
postmodifier, as the one printed in italics.
The universal quantification is then not
contributed by the verbal form but rather
by the postmodifier; the present tense of
the verb merely admits it.
3 The progressive aspect can express uni-
versal quantification, as in &amp;quot;John is always
coming late&amp;quot;. Again, this is only possible
If the quantification proper is contributed
quite explicitly by phrases such as
&amp;quot;always&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;in general&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;regularly&amp;quot; etc.
The sentence is more emotional than the
version in the present tense.
Ignoring all these exceptions we can formulate the
tentative rules R1 and R2 to sum up what the
examples considered so far seem to suggest.
R1) The subject of a sentence is
existentially quantified if the VP is
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9612875">
1. in the past tense,
2. in the progressive aspect, or
3. in the perfective aspect.
R2) Otherwise the subject is universally
quantified, in particular if it is
1. in the present tense or
2. in the future tense.

rough treatment of the problems connected with

2.1.2 Restrictive Constructions
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98680025">
Once we have determined the quantification of the
sentence subject we have to do the same thing for
all other sentential components. Examples 11 and
12 for instance, repeated here for convenience,

are variants of the donkey-sentences quoted
above (7 and 8). There we had the problem that
the object of the restrictive relative clause (&amp;quot;a
donkey&amp;quot;) had to be quantified existentially in the
first case, and universally in the second, syntac-
tically very similar, case. Analogously, we must
now determine how &amp;quot;a woman&amp;quot; is to be quantified.
Again, intuition tells us that it is to be quantified
existentially in example 11 but universally in
example 12. However, how could we derive this
fundamentally different quantification from the
syntactically similar surface sentences?
It&apos;s an intriguing observation that a simple
change in notation will make the problem go away.
Instead of the Predicate Calculus representation

fiers

<sectionHeader confidence="0.9605588" genericHeader="method">

AND loves(M,W)) IMPLIES respects(M,W))
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978487882352941">
we represent 11 and 12 in Horn-Clause logic as
llb and 12b:
11b) happy (M) - man(M) , woman (W) , loves (M , W) .
12b) respects(M,W) man(M), woman(W),
loves (M, W) .
Under the standard interpretation of Horn-clauses
(as in Prolog) a variable is implicitly universally
quantified if it appears on the left hand side of a
clause, but existentially quantified if it appears
exclusively on the right hand side. The intere-
sting fact is that the Horn-clause representations
of the surface sentences are structurally as simi-
lar to each other as the surface sentences are,
and they differ exactly in the same way the sen-
tences do. The seemingly minor change from a
intransitive verb phrase (&amp;quot;he is happy&amp;quot;) to a
transitive verb phrase referring to an element of
the antecedent (&amp;quot;he respects her&amp;quot;) turns an exi-
stential quantification (&amp;quot;any man is happy if there
is a woman he loves&amp;quot;) into a universal quantifica-
tion (&amp;quot;any man respects any woman he happens to
love&amp;quot;). And this is the quantification which virtu-
ally &amp;quot;falls out&amp;quot; of the Horn-clause representation
of theses sentences.
It will be obvious that other restrictive
constructions have to be treated the same way.
Whether we say &amp;quot;a man loving a woman repects
her&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a woman loved by a man adores him&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;a man respects a woman provided he loves her&amp;quot; -
in each case we will have to represent these
restrictive expressions as right hand terms, as
additional conditions on the values of the corres-
ponding variables. We could therefore sketch the
following informal translation correspondences:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996683">
11
</page>
<listItem confidence="0.971801785714286">
1. the main verb (or the predicatively used
noun or adjective, if the verb is &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot;),
i.e. the grammatical predicate of the sen-
tence becomes the logical predicate consti-
tuting the clause head;
2. an indefinite NP becomes a predicate on
the right hand side of the the clause;
3. pronominal reference is represented by the
use of the same variable name within one
clause:
4. restrictive phrases (restrictive relative
clauses, restrictive adjectives, conditional
clauses) become additional terms on the
right hand side of the clause.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986440586956522">
Using these straightforward translation rules, we
get a representation of surface sentences where
the correct quantification, in many cases, &amp;quot;falls
out&amp;quot; of the Horn-clause representation. In these
cases we can then say that an indefinite noun
phrase corresponds neither to a universal nor to
an existential quantifier but that its quantification
is a function of its position in the sentence. We
will soon see that this kind of nice one-to-one
mapping is possible only in a few, simple, cases.&apos;
If we try to sum up what we gleaned from
examples 11 and 12 we could sketch a rule R3:
R3) In a restrictive noun phrase those of
Its arguments are universally quanti-
fied that are referred to by the main verb;
otherwise they are existentially quantified.
If we combine restrictive constructions with &amp;quot;exi-
stentially quantifiying&amp;quot; verb forms, as in example
21
21) A text editor which made modifications
to a text file erased it.
we notice that the quantification imposed by the
main verb overrides the quantification suggested
by the restricitve construction. Example 21 would
have to be represented somehow along the lines of
21a:5
21a) text_editor( editorl) .
text_file( filel ) .
modifies( editorl , filel , timel) .
erases( editorl , filel , timel) .
before( timel , now) .
We do not propose that all natural language
sentences can be represented as (the
Horn-clause version of) First Order Predicate
Calculus sentences. But it seems a sensible idea
to start our search for sources of implicit quan-
tificational information with those simple cases
where it is possible.
5 Existentially quantified variables not in the
scope of a universal quantifier are represented
in Horn-clause logic as a system-generated con-
stant, a so-called Skolem-constant, such as
&amp;quot;Mel&amp;quot;.
We thus have to modify R1 to the effect that the
main verb form enforces its quantification for all
dependent values.

course, one more restriction. In 23, the non-re-
strictive relative clause asserts additional informa-
tion. The author wants to make sure that the
reader is aware of these facts, and that he
absorbs the information if it&apos;s new to him before
he goes on reading. Accordingly we would have
to represent these examples as 22a and 23a

We used the verb in the present tense to keep
the situation as simple as possible. If we now
consider the other possible case, with the verb in
the past tense or in one of the marked aspects,
we will note that 24 is odd to the point of being
ungrammatical, while 25 is perfectly normal.

into additional, universally quantified,

Apart from the relative clauses and the redu-
ced relative clauses in the preceding examples we
can find non-restrictive constructions in the fol-
lowing cases:

text files, is eminently useful.

31) My friend, Peter, was here last night.
32) A command to delete a file will be

33) Another type of command, to save a file,
will be postponed for a few minutes.
34) The decision whether to save or delete
a file is normally made by the user.
35) Another decision, whether to crash or
not to crash, normally isn&apos;t.
3. Prepositional phrases:
36) A backup file on disk is immune from
the effects of system crashes.
37) A backup file, on disk, is immune
from the effects of system crashes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997592282051283">
In this case the non-restrictive variant,
37, has a strong connotation of causality:
&amp;quot; As the file is now on disk, it is immune
from the effects of crashes&amp;quot;.
In all these cases the non-restrictive
construction asserted additional universally
quantified information, although the appo-
sitive constructions seem to cause more
problems than the other cases.

In spoken language we could distinguish bet-
ween the two readings of sentence 38 by means of
stress: The second reading (38b) could be enfor-
ced by stress on the verb (&amp;quot;A Centronics printer
will PRINT a boki_faced character&amp;quot;) while an even
stress distribution on the whole verb phrase
(&amp;quot;... will PRINT A BOLD_FACED CHARACTER&amp;quot;)
would make the first reading (388) far more pro-
bable. In written language we could resort to
topicalizers such as &amp;quot;even&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;A Centronics printer
will even print a bold-faced character ...&amp;quot;. It is
interesting to note that even in examples 39 and
40 which are quantificationally unambiguous for
syntactic reasons alone (39a) the stress is evenly
distributed on the verb &amp;quot;print&amp;quot; and the adjective
&amp;quot;bold-faced&amp;quot; (or on the adverbial &amp;quot;in boldface&amp;quot;,
respectively). As a matter of fact we could say
that stress in English virtually marks certain
words of a sentence as &amp;quot;to be represented as
clause heads&amp;quot; in the Horn-clause translation of
the sentence, with the consequences for their
quantification we just outlined.&amp;quot;&apos;

<bodyText confidence="0.986367666666667">
If the verb of a sentence is a causative verb we
can express the quantification of its argument
values by the choice of the appropriate object
complement.. Example 38 is ambiguous as far as
the quantification of &amp;quot;a bold-faced character&amp;quot; is
concerned (the two readings are &amp;quot;will print some
bold-faced character&amp;quot;, 38a, and &amp;quot;will print any
bold-faced character&amp;quot; it gets, 38b), whereas in 39
and 40 the same expression is unambiguously
quantified; both 39 and 40 are mapped into 39a,
meaning &amp;quot;will print in boldface any character&amp;quot; it
gets. 6

2.1.5 Conjunctions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991344695652174">
In the examples 38 to 40 we used the conjunction
&amp;quot;whenever&amp;quot; instead of the neutral &amp;quot;if&amp;quot;. This isn&apos;t
quite unproblematical, as the choice of a conjunc-
tion may well have its own influence on the quan-
tification of some of the values in the sentence(s)
Involved. However, the precise character of this
influence is unclear to us at the present time. In
example 41 the noun phrase &amp;quot;a student&amp;quot; somehow
seems to have a &amp;quot;higher content&amp;quot; of universal
quantification than 42.
41) If a student knows the words of a text he
can translate it.
42) When a student knows the words of a text he
can translate it.
But the two subtly different interpretations seem
to be possible only because both &amp;quot;he knows&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;he can&amp;quot; are ambiguous: In 41 they can be read
as &amp;quot;he already knows&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;he is capable of,
knows how to&amp;quot;, whereas in 42 they can be read
as &amp;quot;has looked up/has found out&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;he may&amp;quot;.
6 Existentially quantified variables in the scope of
a universal quantifier are represented as
system-generated functions, so-called Skolem-
functions, whose arguments are the variables
over which these universal quantifiers range.
7 Phenomena such as the topic/focus-distinction
and stress/intonation are often considered as
purely stylistic in character. The examples used
will show that this view is often unjustified.
The Prague school has ,of course, always
emphasised that these linguistic means are often
much more than &amp;quot;style&amp;quot;. See the most recent
contribution by the Prague school, Sgall 1984.

2.2.1 Meaning and Type of the Verb
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998891">
Although the syntactic means to express quantifi-
cation can explain quite a few cases of &amp;quot;implicit&amp;quot;
quantification there are cases where they are not
sufficient. Two such cases are examples 43 and
44.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.746178333333333">
43) A man who loves a woman will defend her
against an attacker.
44) A millionaire who is concerned about his after-

<bodyText confidence="0.903501461538462">
life will donate part of his money to a charity
It is intuitively quite certain that we have to
represent these sentences in a fundamentally dif-
ferent way, namely as 43a and 44a.
43a) defends_against(M, W, A) : - man( M) , woman ( W) ,
loves( M, W) ,
attacker(A,W).
44a) donates_to(M, skl (M) , sk2(M) ) : -
millionaire(M),
concerned_about_one&apos;s_afterlife(M).
part_of_money(skl(M)) :
millionaire ( M) ,
concerneci_about_one&apos;s_afterlife(M).
charity ( sk2 (M) :-
millionaire(M),
concernecLabout_one&apos;s_afterlife(M) .
The very meaning of &amp;quot;to defend&amp;quot; seems to enforce
an universal quantification for both of the two
object values, whereas the meaning of &amp;quot;to donate&amp;quot;
seems to create an existential quantification for
its two object values. We could, as a matter of
fact, paraphrase 44 as &amp;quot;If you want to find a
charity, or if you want to see some money, all
you have to do is to find a millionaire with pangs
of religion, and eventually you will see him give
money to a charity&amp;quot;. The meaning of &amp;quot;to donate&amp;quot;
implies that the person donating something
already has, or can easily get, whatever he dona-
tes; he does not have to wait for it to come his
way. Equally, the meaning of the verb implies
that it will be a trivial task to find a taker for
the donation. The meaning of &amp;quot;to defend&amp;quot;, on the
other hand, implies that the integrity of someone
or something is defended against any conceivable
threat, but only if and when a threat becomes
visible. The same thing applies to the person etc.
defended, hence both object values are univer-
sally quantified (provided, of course, the form of
the main verb permits it).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.950764">
2.2.2 Type of Direct Object
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998669969696969">
There are relatively few cases where the meaning
of a verb will unambiguously determine the quan-
tifiaction of its argument values. One verb where
this is certainly not the case is &amp;quot;to give&amp;quot;. It has
(among others) the meaning of &amp;quot;to pass on some-
thing if and when one gets it&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to hand over
something one already has&amp;quot; (in this sense it is
almost equivalent to &amp;quot;to donate&amp;quot;). It&apos;s these two
readings which are unambiguously chosen in
examples 45 and 46, respectively, as is made
clear in their clausal representations 45a and 46a.
45a) give(D,P,police) people(D), decent(D),
lost_property(P),
found(P).
46a) give (D , skl (D, R) , R) : - people (D) , decent ( D ) ,
relatives(R,D),
poor(R).
presents( skl(D , R) ) : - people ( D) , decent ( D ) ,
relatives ( R, D) ,
poor(R).
Again, we can say that the very meaning of the
noun phrase &amp;quot;lost and found property&amp;quot; excludes
an existential quantification. You simply cannot
find something intentionally. On the other hand,
a present is, by definition, something you make
or buy, i.e. you virtually bring it into local (to
the recipient) existence, unless, of course, you
pass on a present you got, which is considered in
poor taste in our societies. This last point
brings us to yet another source of implicit quan-
tificational information: Pragmatic information,
including world knowledge, situation and dis-
course context.

the original collection, viz.

13) A man who loves a woman will give her a ring.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780545454545">
Here, the meaning of the direct object &amp;quot;a ring&amp;quot; is
not sufficient to determine its quantification. A
ring could be found and passed on to someone
one loves, as well as been bought and given
away. However, our world knowledge (rather than
our language knowledge) tells us that a man
doesn&apos;t normally have to wait until he finds a
ring if he really wants to give one to a cherished
person. He can go and buy one; there are rings
affordable to just about anyone. That&apos;s why 13a
would be heavily favoured over 13b.
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.947234">
13a) gives(M,skl(M,W),W) man(M), woman(W),

loves(M, W) , ring( R) .
</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.996076272727273">
Similarly, discourse and situation context can
determine the quantification in otherwise ambigu-
ous sentences, such as 47.
47) This printer will print a bold-faced
character if you hit this key here.
Here the situation context, as referred to by the
three demonstratives, seems to impose an existen-
tial quantification on &amp;quot;a character&amp;quot;. The sentence
clearly means that pressing the key referred to
will immediately result in the creation of a
character, which will also be in boldface.

<bodyText confidence="0.999609166666667">
There are quite a few sources of &amp;quot;implicit&amp;quot; quan-
tification in English, most of them syntactic, some
semantic, and a few pragmatic in character. Some
of them fall into the category of linguistic means
often considered purely stylistic, such as the
topic/comment-distinction and stress/intonation.

<abstract confidence="0.988993944444445">It has traditionally been assumed that Natural Language uses explicit quantifier expressions (such as &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;most&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;) for the purpose of quantification. We argue that expressions of the first type are comparatively rare in real world Natural Language sentences, and that the latter (articles) cannot be considered straightforward quantifiers in the first place. However, practically all applications of Natural Language Processing require sentences to be quantified unambiguously. We list a few possible (syntactical, semantical, and &amp;quot;pragmatical&amp;quot;) sources of &amp;quot;implicit&amp;quot; quantifications&apos; information in Natural Language; they combine in sometimes intricate ways to give a sentence a (more or less) unambiguous quantification. 1.

Determiners are some, every, each, all, both, no, neither, many, few, most, a few, one, etc. However, even now a sizeable majority of sentences in any real world text would appear to lack quantification. That&apos;s why the most obvious determiners, viz, the and a (plus zero) have to be included in this list. But that&apos;s also where a new set of problems originates. Articles have always caused problems when treated as quantifiers, and recently these problems have become increasingly • more difficult to ignore (Kamp 1981). 1.3 PROBLEMS WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES AS QUANTIFIERS Again we start with the most traditional view of the question how articles could be interpreted as quantifiers. It saw both definite and indefinite articles as existential quantifiers, with some additional information in the case of the definite article. It was primarily this &amp;quot;additional information&amp;quot; which caused much discussion. 1 or verb phrases such as &amp;quot;there is&amp;quot; - quite possibly the only &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; existential quantifier English has. 8 1.3.1 Is the Definite Article an Existential Quantifier?

The suggestion that we could temporarily restrict the universe of discourse to the point that it contains only one dog, precisely the one that is barking, is hardly very convincing on intuitive grounds alone, and furthermore McCawley (1981:265) pointed out that it would make sentences 6 and 6a equivalent, which they definitely are not. 6) The dog likes all dogs. 6a) The dog likes itself. It might be more appropriate to talk about uniqueness in a contextual domain (McCawley 1981:265, expanding on Karttunen 1976; also Platteau 1980, Kamp 1981, Frey/Reyle 1983) whose members are created by the context, and are not necessarily elementary real world objects (as in the universe of discourse) but can be sets of real objects, or possibly even purely notional objects such as concepts. As the problems of definite reference are treated in-depth elsewhere in this volume (Berry-Rogghe) we will restrict ourselves to this very sketchy outline of the problem. The main point in this context is that any notion of the definite article having an existential quantifier as one of its components has evaporated along the way from Russell&apos;s analysis to </context>

We obviously presuppose the existence of the concept of unicorns and lions in the listener&apos;s mind, but not the existence of these animals in the real world. Example 5 shows that definite noun phrases don&apos;t presuppose uniqueness of real objects, either. 5 makes perfect sense, in the appropriate context, but nobody would presuppose that there is only one dog in the world. The suggestion that we could temporarily restrict the universe of discourse to the point that it contains only one dog, precisely the one that is barking, is hardly very convincing on intuitive grounds alone, and furthermore McCawley (1981:265) pointed out that it would make sentences 6 and 6a equivalent, which they definitely are not. 6) The dog likes all dogs. 6a) The dog likes itself. It might be more appropriate to talk about uniqueness in a contextual domain (McCawley 1981:265, expanding on Karttunen 1976; also Platteau 1980, Kamp 1981, Frey/Reyle 1983) whose members are created by the context, and are not necessarily elementary real world objects (as in the universe of discourse) but can be sets of real objects, or possibly even purely notional objects such as concepts.

As the problems of definite reference are treated in-depth elsewhere in this volume (Berry-Rogghe) we will restrict ourselves to this very sketchy outline of the problem. The main point in this context is that any notion of the definite article having an existential quantifier as one of its components has evaporated along the way from Russell&apos;s a</context>

Russell, in his classical analysis of the definite article (1905), maintained that a sentence such as 1) The President of France is bald should be interpreted as follows EXISTS X:(president_of_france(X) AND NOT(EXISTS Y:(president_of_france(Y) AND NOT(X=Y))) AND bald(X) ) Here the &amp;quot;additional information&amp;quot; is given in the universal statement that X is the one and only President of France. Strawson (1950) pointed out that sentences such as 2 2) The king of France is bald would simply be false irrespective of whether a) there was exactly one king of France but he was not bald, b) there was no king of France to begin with, or c) there were several kings of France. Our intuition tells us that in case a) sentence 2 would certainly be &amp;quot;simply false&amp;quot; but In cases b) and c) it would be false &amp;quot;in a different way&amp;quot;. Strawson argued that Russell hadn&apos;t made the distinction between a sentence as such and the statement made by the use of a sentence. Sentences such as example 2, uttered at the present time,</context>
