Intersentential elliptical utterances occur frequently during information-seeking dialogs in task do-
mains. This paper presents a pragmatics-based framework for interpreting such utterances. Discourse
expectations and focusing heuristics are used to facilitate recognition of an information-seeker&apos;s intent
in uttering an elliptical fragment. The ellipsis is comprehended by identifying both the aspect of the
information-seeker&apos;s task-related plan highlighted by the fragment and the conversational discourse
goal fulfilled by the utterance. The contribution of this approach is its consideration of pragmatic
information, including discourse content and conversational goals, rather than just the precise
representation of the preceding utterance.

1 INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999329">
Incomplete utterances are common in communication
between humans. They range from sentences that fail to
include all requisite semantic information to syntacti-
cally incomplete sentence fragments. In many cases,
these utterances cannot be understood in isolation, but
must be interpreted within the established context.
Precisely how this should be done is a difficult problem
for natural language systems.
One might suggest that the problem be avoided in
man-machine communication by training human users
to employ only syntactically and semantically complete
utterances. However, this does not appear to be feasi-
ble, as demonstrated in an empirical study conducted by
Carbonell (1983) in which it was shown that human
users find it easy to avoid complex syntactic structures
but difficult to avoid incomplete utterances.
Even if it were possible to train users to avoid
incomplete utterances, these restrictions would be un-
desirable. Constraining man-machine communication to
only a subset of the utterances normally employed by
humans would force users to give less attention to their
problem solving goals in order to concentrate more on
the preciseness of their utterances. In addition, it ap-
pears that fragmentary utterances are not merely a
result of sloppy communication. Although every utter-
ance has a discourse goal (a conversational or commu-
nicative goal such as answering a question or seeking
clarification), elliptical fragments are often used to
accomplish discourse goals that would require more
effort to convey with a complete sentence. For exam-
ple, in the following dialog&apos;, Speaker 2&apos;s fragment
expresses doubt about the proposition stated by
Speaker 1.

Speaker 1: &amp;quot;The Korean jet shot down by the Soviets
was a spy plane.&amp;quot;
Speaker 2: &amp;quot;With 269 people on board?&amp;quot;
However, a complete sentence such as
Speaker 2: &amp;quot;Was the Korean jet shot down by the
Soviets a spy plane with 269 people on board?&amp;quot;
fails to adequately communicate the doubt conveyed by
the previous fragment. Only a more complex sentence
that marks the discourse goal, such as
Speaker 2: &amp;quot;How can you think that the Korean jet
shot down by the Soviets was a spy plane, when it
had 269 people on board?&amp;quot;
will accomplish this objective.
Thus a robust natural language interface must handle
the kinds of incomplete utterances normally used by
humans. To do otherwise is to prohibit communication
that humans regard as natural, and therefore detract
from their ability to communicate as effectively with
machines as they do with one another.
Contextual ellipsis in dialog is the use of a sentence
fragment (a syntactically incomplete utterance), along
with the context established by the preceding dialog, to
communicate a complete thought and accomplish a

speech act2. Such fragments are often referred to as
intersentential ellipsis since they appear between sen-
tences in a dialog. It can be seen, however, that
understanding intersentential ellipsis often depends
more on pragmatic knowledge, such as the inferred
task-related plan and discourse goals motivating the
speaker, than on the syntactic structure or semantic
content of preceding utterances. This is illustrated by
Examples 2 and 3, in which Speaker l&apos;s communicated
goal and the relevant plans for accomplishing it play a
major role in understanding the elliptical fragment.

In Example 2, Speaker l&apos;s goal is to cash a check, and

particular distribution of paper money; in Example 3,
Speaker l&apos;s goal is hiring programming consultants,
perhaps for an introductory programming course, and
the relevant plans for doing this include a subplan for
identifying the best applicant.
Previous research on understanding intersentential
ellipsis has emphasized syntactic and semantic strate-
gies (Hendrix et al. 1978; Waltz 1978; Weischedel and
Sondheimer 1982; Carbonell 1983), but the contribu-
tions of the speaker&apos;s plans and goals to the interpreta-
tion of ellipsis has hitherto been inadequately explored.
One objective of our research has been to investigate a
plan-based framework for understanding intersentential
ellipsis that occurs in task-oriented dialogs. Our work
shows that elliptical fragments can be viewed as high-
lighting aspects of the information-seeker&apos;s task-related
plan, with the focus of attention in the plan providing
the context in which the fragment should be under-
stood.
But identifying the aspect of the speaker&apos;s plan
highlighted by the ellipsis is not enough to understand
the utterance. As shown by Grosz (1979), a speaker may
pursue several different kinds of goals with a single
utterance. For example, an information-seeker has the
long-term goal of performing a task comprised of sub-
tasks; this hierarchical structure produces a set of
task-related goals. The information seeker is attempting
to construct a plan for his underlying task, resulting in
plan formation goals. In addition, each utterance pur-
sues a more immediate discourse goal, such as request-
ing information or seeking clarification. As has been
shown by several researchers (Mann et al. 1977; Reich-
man 1978; Pollack et al. 1982), one must determine not
only the element of the task being addressed by an
utterance, but also the discourse goal being fulfilled by
it. Previous research on understanding ellipsis has ig-
nored this aspect. Thus a second objective of our
research has been to formulate a strategy for recogniz-
ing discourse goals communicated by elliptical frag-
ments. Our work indicates that mutual beliefs and
expectations developed from the preceding dialog play a
major role in identifying the intent behind intersenten-
tial ellipsis.
Our processing framework coordinates many knowl-
edge sources, including discourse expectations, inferred
beliefs, the information-seeker&apos;s inferred task-related
plan, and focusing strategies, to produce a rich inter-
pretation of ellipsis. It is the first interpretation strategy
to address the problem of identifying the discourse goal
accomplished via an intersentential elliptical fragment.
As a result, this pragmatics-based framework under-
stands elliptical fragments that other systems cannot
handle.

2 STRATEGIES FOR INTERPRETING INTERSENTENTIAL

ELLIPSIS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999835">
As illustrated by Examples 1, 2, and 3, intersentential
elliptical fragments cannot be understood in isolation
from the context in which they occur. Therefore a
strategy for interpreting such fragments must rely on
knowledge obtained from sources other than the frag-
ment itself. Three possibilities exist: the syntactic form
of preceding utterances, the semantic representation of
preceding utterances, and expectations gleaned from
understanding the preceding discourse.
A strategy using the first kind of knowledge might
perform two transformations on the syntactic form of a
preceding utterance.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9927">
1. a substitution/expansion operation in which the

elliptical fragment is substituted for a syntactic
constituent in the preceding utterance, or the
syntactic representation of the preceding utter-
ance is expanded to accommodate the fragment.

<listItem confidence="0.584494">
2. a transformation operation that maps questions

into answers, statements into questions, etc.
Syntactic strategies are exemplified by the work in
Hendrix et al. (1978) and Weischedel et al. (1982).
However, many examples of ellipsis cannot be handled
by syntactic strategies. Consider again the dialog pre-
sented in Example 2. No transformation or modification
of Speaker l&apos;s first statement will produce an utterance
that represents the intended meaning of Speaker l&apos;s
elliptical fragment.
The second potential strategy uses the semantic
representation of the last utterance as a pattern that
suggests slots for which an elliptical fragment may
provide a filler or a substitution. Semantic strategies are
presented in Waltz (1978) and Carbonell (1983). How-
ever, semantic strategies require an extensive case

frame representation and are inadequate for handling
elliptical fragments that rely on an assumed communi-
cation of the underlying task. For example, it is improb-
able that the case frame for programming consultant in
Example 3 would contain slots for the recommendations
of individual faculty.
The third potential strategy utilizes pragmatic knowl-
edge, such as a model of the information-seeker&apos;s
inferred task-related plan and expected discourse goals.
The power of this approach is its reliance on knowledge
gleaned from the dialog, including discourse content
and conversational goals, rather than on precise repre-
sentations of the preceding utterances alone.
Allen (Allen et al. 1980) addressed the problem of
understanding sentence fragments occurring at the out-
set of a dialog, and was the first to relate ellipsis
processing to the domain-dependent plan underlying a
speaker&apos;s utterance. Allen viewed the speaker&apos;s utter-
ance as part of a plan that the speaker had constructed
and was executing to accomplish his overall task-related
goals (in this case, to meet or board a train). To interpret
elliptical fragments, Allen first constructed a set of
possible surface speech act representations for the
elliptical fragment, limited by syntactic clues appearing
in the fragment; he then attempted to infer the speaker&apos;s
goal-related plan that included an execution of the
observed utterance. A part of this inference process
involved determining which of the partially constructed
plans, connecting the task-related goals of meeting or
boarding a train and the observed utterance, were
reasonable given the knowledge and mutual beliefs of
the speaker and hearer. Allen selected the surface
speech act that produced the most reasonable inferred
plan as the correct interpretation.
Allen noted that the speaker&apos;s fragment must identify
the subgoals that the speaker is pursuing, but claimed
that in very restricted domains, identifying the speak-
er&apos;s overall goal from the utterance was sufficient to
identify the appropriate response in terms of the obsta-
cles present in such a plan. For isolated sentence
fragments in his restricted domain of train arrivals and
departures, Allen&apos;s interpretation strategy worked well.
To understand elliptical fragments during a dialog in a
more complex domain, it is necessary to identify the
particular aspect of the speaker&apos;s overall task-related
plan addressed by the fragment and recognize the
discourse or communicative goal being pursued.
More recently, Litman (1986) developed a plan-based
theory that incorporates both domain plans and meta-
plans to understand utterances. Similar to Allen, Lit-
man used syntactic clues in the utterance to postulate
speech acts &amp;quot;request&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;inform&amp;quot; that an elliptical
fragment was intended to accomplish, and she then
attempted to construct an inference path from a postu-
lated speech act to the plan inferred for the speaker.
However, it appears that Litman&apos;s system would handle
an elliptical fragment such as
&amp;quot;With 269 people on board?&amp;quot;
from Example 1 in much the same way as the complete
sentence
&amp;quot;Did the Korean jet have 269 people on board?&amp;quot;
As such, Litman&apos;s strategy would be unable to recog-
nize the surprise and doubt conveyed by the elliptical
fragment in Example 1. In addition, Litman&apos;s metaplans
(such as Introduce-Plan, Continue-Plan, and Modify-
Plan) are more like plan construction metaplans than
metaplans representing communicative goals such as
expressing surprise or seeking clarification of a ques-
tion. We contend that recognition of the speaker&apos;s
discourse or communicative goal must be an integral
part of any strategy that really understands ellipsis.
In addition to the syntactic, semantic, and plan-based
strategies, a few other heuristics have been devised.
Carbonell (1983) used rules that suggested a set of
expected user utterances and related elliptical frag-
ments to these expected patterns. For example, if the
system asked the user whether a particular value should
be used as the filler of a slot in a case frame, the system
then expected the user&apos;s utterance to contain a confir-
mation or disconfirmation pattern, a different filler for
the slot, a comparative pattern such as &amp;quot;too hard&amp;quot;, and
so forth. Although these rules use expectations about
how the speaker might respond, they seem to have little
to do with the expected discourse goals of the speaker;
as a result, they would be unable to differentiate frag-
ments that merely request information from fragments
whose intent is to seek clarification or express surprise.

3 SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985125">
This paper describes a pragmatics-based approach for
understanding intersentential elliptical fragments that
occur in information-seeking dialogs. We have studied
dialogs in which the information-seeker is attempting to
construct a plan for accomplishing a task, but the plan
itself will be executed at some time in the future.
Examples of such tasks include expanding a company&apos;s
product line, purchasing a home, pursuing a degree, or
even taking a vacation. We have selected this class of
dialogs because they are typical of a large percentage of
the interactions with database management systems,
decision support systems, and expert systems. How-
ever, the principles presented in this paper should be
extendible to other kinds of dialogs.
Our hypotheses and strategies were motivated by an
analysis of naturally occurring dialogs from several
domains, including a radio call-in show4 providing ad-
vice on investments, interactions with the REL (Thomp-
son 1980) natural language interface to a ship data base,
and student advisement sessions. We are assuming that
the natural language system plays the role of informa-
tion-provider and that communication is via a typical
terminal. Since our primary interest in this research is
the affect of expectations and inferred knowledge on

ellipsis understanding, we have not considered the
contribution of clue words (words and phrases, such as
&amp;quot;Now&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;As I was saying&amp;quot;, that contain informa-
tion about the structure of a discourse (Reichman 1978))
to the processing of ellipsis. However, they certainly
could be incorporated into our strategy.
In this research, we are attempting to ascertain the
extent to which pragmatic knowledge can be used to
understand ellipsis and the limitations of such an ap-
proach. However, we do not maintain that a natural
language system should use only pragmatic knowledge;
a robust system will need to coordinate syntactic,
semantic, and pragmatic techniques in order to fully
understand the wide variety of elliptical utterances
employed in human communication.
In the remainder of this paper, we argue for the use of
pragmatic knowledge in ellipsis understanding, and
present a pragmatics-based approach for understanding
intersentential elliptical fragments uttered by a person
seeking information in order to construct a plan for
accomplishing a task. Section 4 discusses the knowl-
edge needed to understand elliptical fragments. Section
5 describes our overall interpretation framework, which
is presented in detail in sections 6-8. Our strategy views
elliptical fragments as highlighting, or bringing to atten-
tion, aspects of the information-seeker&apos;s underlying
task-related plan, with discourse expectations used to
guide interpretation. Section 6 presents the discourse or
communicative goals that we have found pursued via
elliptical fragments in information-seeking dialogs. Sec-
tion 7 discusses how discourse expectations develop
during a dialog, describes how these expectations sug-
gest discourse goals that an information-seeker might
pursue, and presents discourse goal rules for recogniz-
ing elliptical fragments that accomplish a particular
discourse goal. The discourse goal rules guide how the
fragment&apos;s highlighting of a component of the task-
related plan should be understood; Section 8 describes
a strategy for identifying the highlighted portion of the
plan. Section 9 illustrates our framework with several
examples, and sections 10 and 11 discuss future exten-
sions to this work and our conclusions. Throughout this
paper, the information seeker and information provider
will be referred to as IS and IP respectively.

4 REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954285714286">
A speaker can felicitously employ intersentential ellip-
sis only if he believes his utterance will be properly
understood and his intent recognized by the listener.
The motivation for this work is the hypothesis that
speaker and hearer mutually believe that certain knowl-
edge has been acquired during the course of the dialog
and that this factual knowledge along with other proc-
essing knowledge will be used to deduce the speaker&apos;s
intentions. We claim that the requisite factual knowl-
edge includes the speaker&apos;s inferred task-related plan,
the speaker&apos;s inferred beliefs, and the anticipated dis-
course goals of the speaker; we claim that the requisite
processing knowledge includes plan recognition strate-
gies and focusing techniques.

4.1 TASK-RELATED PLAN
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937228571429">
According to Grice (1957,1969), a listener must infer a
speaker&apos;s intent in making an utterance. Now consider
an incomplete utterance. The listener, in attempting to
deduce the speaker&apos;s intent, will be guided by Grice&apos;s
conversational maxims (Grice 1975). In particular,
Grice&apos;s maxims of manner and relation suggest that the
speaker believes his utterance is an adequate vehicle for
conveying his intentions and that the utterance is rele-
vant to the current dialog. A cooperative listener will
have assimilated the preceding dialog, inferred much of
the underlying task-related plan motivating the speak-
er&apos;s queries, and be focused on that aspect of the task
on which the information-seeker&apos;s attention was cen-
tered (Grosz 1977; Carberry 1983; Carberry 1988) im-
mediately prior to the new utterance. Given an incom-
plete utterance, the listener can use this acquired
knowledge to attempt to deduce the speaker&apos;s inten-
tions by trying to fit the utterance into the partially
constructed plan, and thereby enable the dialog to
continue without interruption.
This claim that the speaker&apos;s underlying task-related
plan is an essential component of an ellipsis interpreta-
tion strategy is further supported by research demon-
strating the need for considering such plans in under-
standing other types of utterances. Grosz (1977) and
Robinson (1981) used models of the speaker&apos;s task in
apprentice-expert dialogs to determine the referents of
definite noun phrases and verb phrases. Perrault and
Allen (Perrault et al. 1980) used expectations of speaker
goals, and inference of their plans for achieving these
goals, in the interpretation of indirect speech acts. In
addition, Allen (Allen et al. 1980) introduced the con-
cept of a plan-based strategy for interpreting fragmen-
tary utterances at the outset of a dialog in a restricted
domain.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997726">
4.2 SHARED BELIEFS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999806125">
Shared beliefs, beliefs which the listener believes
speaker and listener mutually hold, are a second com-
ponent of factual knowledge required for processing
intersentential elliptical fragments. These shared beliefs
either represent presumed a priori knowledge of the
domain, such as a presumption that dialog participants
in a university domain know that each course has a
teacher, or beliefs derived from the dialog itself. An
example of the latter occurs if IP tells IS that CS360 is
a 5 credit hour course; IS may not himself believe that
CS360 is a 5 credit hour course, but as a result of IP&apos;s
utterance and the assumption of a cooperative dialog,
he does believe it is mutually believed that IP believes
this.
Real understanding requires that we identify the
speaker&apos;s discourse goal in making the utterance.

<bodyText confidence="0.995548828571429">
Shared beliefs, often called mutual beliefs, form a part
of communicated knowledge used to interpret utter-
ances and identify discourse goals in a cooperative
dialog. The following two dialog sequences illustrate
how IP&apos;s beliefs about IS influence understanding.
IS: &amp;quot;When does CS400 meet?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;CS400 meets on Monday from 7 pm until 9 pm.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;Who is teaching it?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Brown.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;At night?&amp;quot;
Most people would interpret the fragmentary utterance
&amp;quot;At night?&amp;quot; as an expression of surprise and request for
corroboration or explanation. Now consider the follow-
ing dialog:
IS: &amp;quot;Who is teaching CS400?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Brown is teaching CS400.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;At night?&amp;quot;
In this case, the elliptical fragment &amp;quot;At night?&amp;quot; would
be understood as a simple request to know whether
CS400 is meeting at night. The reason for this difference
in interpretation is the difference in beliefs regarding IS
at the time the elliptical fragment is uttered. In the latter
case, IP believes it is mutually believed that IS does not
know IP&apos;s beliefs about the meeting time of CS400.
Since IS cannot be surprised about something he
doesn&apos;t know, a different intention or discourse goal is
attributed to him.
Allen and Perrault (Perrault et al. 1980) used mutual
beliefs in their work on indirect speech acts and sug-
gested their use in clarification and correction dialogs.
Sidner (1983, 1985) models user beliefs about system
capabilities in her work on recognizing speaker inten-
tion in utterances. Mutual beliefs appear to be a major
influence on how human listeners interpret and respond
to utterances.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999067">
4.3 DISCOURSE EXPECTATIONS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964533333333">
A number of researchers (Sacks et al. 1974; Labov and
Fanshel 1977; Mann et al. 1977) have noted regularities
in dialog and have attempted to capture these regulari-
ties in knowledge structures that can be used for com-
prehending utterances. For example, Mann, Moore,
and Levin (Mann et al. 1977) used a knowledge struc-
ture called a dialog game to model goal-related use of
language in joint interactions such as buying/selling and
learning/teaching. Grosz and Sidner (Grosz et al. 1986)
and Reichman (1984) have investigated discourse struc-
ture and have shown that a coherent discourse can be
segmented into units that have well-defined relation-
ships to one another. Reichman contended further that
the existing discourse structure established expecta-
tions about appropriate next conversational moves.
Our analysis of naturally occurring dialog indicates
that such expectations about appropriate next steps in
the dialog form a third component of factual knowledge
that plays a major role in comprehending elliptical
fragments. The dialog preceding an elliptical utterance
may suggest discourse or communicative goals for the
speaker, such as seeking clarification of a question,
expressing surprise at a question, or answering a ques-
tion. Our transcript analysis leads us to hypothesize that
these suggested discourse goals become shared knowl-
edge between speaker and hearer and that, as a result,
the listener is on the lookout for the speaker to pursue
these anticipated discourse goals and interprets utter-
ances accordingly.
Consider for example the following dialog:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.914422">
Example 4
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998942857142857">
IP: &amp;quot;Do you want to take CS360?&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;Who is teaching it?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Brown and Dr. White.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;Yes, with Dr. White.&amp;quot;
In this example, IP&apos;s initial query produces a strong
anticipation that IS will pursue the discourse goal of
providing the requested information. Therefore subse-
quent utterances should be processed with the expecta-
tion that IS will eventually address this goal. IS&apos;s first
utterance is interpreted as pursuing a discourse goal of
seeking additional information in order to answer the
question. IS&apos;s last utterance reverts back to addressing
the original expectation and answers the initial query
posed by IP.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99705">
4.4 PROCESSING KNOWLEDGE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993356">
Our transcript analysis indicates that plan recognition
strategies and focusing techniques are necessary com-
ponents of processing knowledge for interpreting in-
tersentential ellipsis. Plan recognition strategies are
essential in order to infer a model of the speaker&apos;s
underlying task-related plan, shown earlier to be an
essential component of factual knowledge, and to con-
sider possible expansions of that plan when processing
elliptical fragments.
Focusing techniques (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1981; Rob-
inson 1981; McKeown 1985; Carberry 1988) are neces-
sary in order to identify that portion of the underlying
plan to which a fragmentary utterance refers. Consider
again the dialog in Example 3. The focus of attention in
this dialog is on considering the job applicants and
evaluating them; therefore IS is most expected to con-
tinue with this subtask before considering other aspects
of his overall task (Carberry 1983, 1988). As a result,
IS&apos;s fragmentary utterance &amp;quot;Tom&apos;s recommendation?&amp;quot;
will be understood as a request for Tom&apos;s opinion about
the suitability of the job applicants for the job of
programming consultant. However, if the focus of at-
tention were instead on determining the number of
consultants needed, then IS&apos;s fragmentary utterance
would be understood differently.

processor has access to a model of the preceding dialog
containing 1. a context tree (Carberry 1988) represent-
ing IS&apos;s inferred underlying task-related plan; 2. a stack
containing the discourse expectations for IS, and 3. a
belief model representing IS&apos;s inferred beliefs. These
comprise the requisite factual knowledge discussed in
the preceding section.
We claim that the discourse expectations for IS
should be used to guide interpretation of fragmentary
utterances. The top element of the discourse stack
represents the most immediate discourse expectation
for IS and suggests potential discourse goals that IS
might be expected to pursue. If IS employs a complete
utterance, the utterance generally gives clues about IS&apos;s
discourse goal; in this case, the discourse expectations
play a secondary role. However, if IS employs an
elliptical fragment, then he must intend that the frag-
ment be interpreted according to these expectations. IS
believes that IP expects him to pursue certain discourse
goals and therefore that IP will be anticipating utter-
ances directed toward these goals. If IS does not want
his utterance interpreted according to these expecta-
tions, then his utterance must override them, either by
not producing an interpretation appropriate to an ex-
pected discourse goal or by explicitly suggesting a
different discourse goal (via the use of clue words).
Otherwise IS is assumed to intend that his utterance be
interpreted according to IP&apos;s expectations.
The following alternative utterances by IS illustrate
this hypothesis:
IP: &amp;quot;Do you want to take CS360?&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.96235">
Response 1: IS: &amp;quot;Are you asking me if I want to take
it next semester?&amp;quot;
Response 2: IS: &amp;quot;Will it be offered next semester?&amp;quot;
Response 3: IS: &amp;quot;Next semester?&amp;quot;
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917860465116">
In Response 1, IS&apos;s utterance indicates that it is an
attempt to clarify the question posed by IP; in Response
2, IS&apos;s utterance simply requests information about
CS360 in order to formulate an answer to IP&apos;s question.
However, in Response 3, IS&apos;s utterance is an elliptical
fragment that conceivably could produce several differ-
ent interpretations. It might be an attempt to clarify the
question posed by IP, it might be a request for informa-
tion about when CS360 is offered in order to formulate
an answer to the posed question, or it might be an
expression of surprise that IP would ask such a question
(for example, if CS360 is only offered next semester and
IS already has a very full schedule). Such elliptical
fragments do not explicitly indicate IS&apos;s discourse goal
in uttering the fragment and thus understanding relies
heavily on mutual beliefs, including the discourse goals
that IS is expected to pursue.
Thus we claim that IS must intend that his elliptical
fragment be interpreted according to these mutually
believed expectations. Figure 1 presents our algorithm
for ellipsis resolution. It uses the stack of discourse
expectations to control interpretation of elliptical frag-
ments (Loop A of Figure 1). Associated with each
expectation is a discourse expectation rule that suggests
discourse goals that IS might pursue (steps 2 and 3 in
Figure 1). Each suggested discourse goal has one or
more associated discourse goal rules that are applied in
an attempt to produce a coherent interpretation of the
elliptical fragment (Loop B in Figure 1). We view IS&apos;s
elliptical fragment as highlighting, or bringing to atten-
tion, some aspect of the underlying task-related plan.
The condition part of a discourse goal rule uses the
aspect of the plan highlighted by the elliptical fragment,
as identified by a plan analyzer (step 9 in Figure 1),
along with other factual and processing knowledge to
determine whether its associated discourse goal should
be recognized as the discourse goal being pursued by
IS. If the condition part of a discourse goal rule is
satisfied, the rule then produces an interpretation of the
elliptical fragment relevant to the recognized discourse
goal (steps 11-13 in Figure 1). The individual steps of
the algorithm in Figure 1 will be described in the
following sections.

6 DISCOURSE GOALS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985647058823">
We define a discourse goal intuitively as what the
speaker is trying to do in making an utterance. The
discourse goal itself is content independent, although its
realization in an utterance will involve some term or
proposition from the speaker&apos;s underlying task-related
plan. For example, the discourse goal Express-Sur-
prise-Obtain-Corroboration represents a speaker&apos;s at-
tempt to convey to his listener that he is surprised at
some proposition P and would like justification of it.
A number of researchers have contended that a
coherent discourse consists of segments that are related
to one another. The structuring relations have been
given many names, including rhetorical predicates
(Grimes 1975, McKeown 1985), coherence relations
(Hobbs 1979), discourse segment purposes (Grosz
1986), and conversational moves (Reichman 1984). Our
concept of discourse goals is closest to Grosz and
Sidner&apos;s discourse segment purposes and Reichman&apos;s
conversational moves. Grosz and Sidner define a dis-
course segment purpose as the intended role of a
discourse segment in achieving an overall discourse
purpose. They contend that the discourse segment
successfully serves its intended function only if the
discourse segment purpose is recognized by the lis-
tener. Similarly, we contend that understanding an
elliptical fragment requires that the listener identify the
discourse goal being pursued by the speaker in uttering
the fragment. Reichman differentiated between utter-
ances that continued the current discourse segment and
utterances that constituted conversational moves to a
segment playing a different role in the overall dialog.
Some of her conversational moves, such as challenging
a claim, had the flavor of goals that one might pursue in
a dialog. Similar to our work, Reichman contended that

conversational moves establish expectations about sub-
sequent conversational moves. However, both dis-
course segment purposes and conversational moves
differ from our discourse goals in that a discourse
segment may contain more than one utterance—ie.,
discourse segment purposes and conversational moves
relate discourse segments, not utterances. In addition,
neither Grosz and Sidner nor Reichman provide the
details of a computational mechanism for identifying the
role of an utterance in a dialog. Our theory does this for
elliptical fragments in an information-seeking dialog.
Given the discourse goal expectations, it provides a
mechanism for understanding an elliptical fragment by
recognizing the intentions it communicates.
We have analyzed dialogs from several different
domains and have identified 15 discourse goals that
occur during information seeking dialogs and which
may be accomplished via elliptical fragments. The fol-
lowing are some of these discourse goals, with illustra-
tive examples.

7.1 DISCOURSE EXPECTATIONS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986882352941">
The discourse goals of the preceding section also serve
as discourse expectations. As argued in Section 43,
discourse expectations play a major role in the compre-
hension of elliptical fragments. When IS makes an
utterance, he is attempting to accomplish a discourse
goal; this discourse goal may in turn establish expecta-
tions about what IS will do next. For example, if IS asks
a question, one anticipates that IS may want to expand
on his question by further identifying an entity or by
clarifying the question.
Similarly, utterances made by IP also establish ex-
pectations for IS. These discourse expectations may
often be met implicitly as well as explicitly. Consider
what happens when IP poses a question to IS. In a
cooperative dialog, we expect IS to answer the ques-
tion. But before that can occur, IS must understand the
question and accept it as relevant and valid. Normally
dialog participants accept such questions implicitly by
answering the question or by proceeding to seek infor-
mation relevant to formulating an answer. However, IS
may be unable to accept the question posed by IP
because he does not understand it (perhaps he is unable
to identify some of the entities mentioned in the ques-
tion), or because he is surprised by it. This leads IS to
pursue discourse goals such as seeking confirmation,
seeking the identify of an entity, seeking clarification of
the posed question, or expressing surprise at the ques-
tion. Thus, when IP poses a question to IS, our dis-
course expectations are that IS will first accept the
question (or if that is not yet possible, work towards
accepting it) and then answer it. Thus these two expec-
tations must be pushed onto the discourse stack and
should serve to guide our understanding of elliptical
fragments.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993858">
7.2 THE DISCOURSE STACK
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989727272727">
The discourse stack contains expectations about IS&apos;s
discourse behavior, along with the semantic represen-
tation of the utterance that prompted the expectation.
We contend that understanding elliptical fragments re-
lies on discourse expectations that are pushed onto or
popped from the stack as a result of utterances made by
IS and IP. Precisely how this is accomplished in all
cases is unclear. However, in this section, we will
motivate the contents of the discourse stack by giving a
set of stack processing rules that hold for simple
utterancess. These rules presume that the discourse
goal accomplished by an utterance can be identified.
Although our theory for ellipsis processing includes
recognition of the discourse goal fulfilled by an elliptical
fragment, we have not investigated the recognition of
discourse goals pursued via complete sentences. This is
an issue that requires further study and must take into
account indirect speech acts (Perrault et al. 1980). The
discourse stack accessed by our ellipsis processor
(steps 2 and 14 in Figure 1) represents the system&apos;s
current beliefs about discourse expectations, but our
implementation does not include actually constructing it
from the dialog preceding the elliptical fragment. Our
intent in this section is to motivate the contents of the
discourse stack immediately preceding an elliptical frag-
ment.
For example, when IP asks a question of IS, IS is
first expected to accept the question, either explicitly or
implicitly, and then answer the question. Similarly,
when IP answers a question posed by IS, IS is expected
to accept the response, either explicitly or implicitly,
and then pursue other discourse goals. This reasoning
leads to the stack processing ( SP) rules.

<bodyText confidence="0.971232115384616">
SP1: If IP asks a question of IS with the discourse
goal of seeking information, Answer-Question and
Accept Question are pushed onto the discourse
stack.
SP2: When IP answers a question posed by IS,
Accept-Response is pushed onto the discourse
stack.
When IS pursues a discourse goal, such as seeking
information or clarification, one&apos;s expectation is that IS
will continue pursuing this discourse goal with subse-
quent utterances. This leads to the stack processing rule
SP3: When IS actively pursues a discourse goal, the
discourse goal is pushed onto the discourse stack.
Although the strongest expectations are that IS will
pursue a goal suggested by the top element of the
discourse stack, this expectation can be passed over, at
which point it no longer suggests expectations for
utterances. This produces the stack popping ( SPP) rule
SP4: When IS&apos; s utterance does not pursue a goal
suggested by the top entry on the discourse stack,
this entry is popped from the stack.
Other stack processing rules are similarly motivated and
formulated. If IP asks or answers a question, SP1 or SP2
respectively apply. If IS makes an utterance, then rule
SP4 is applied until it fails, at which point rule SP3 is
applied.

7.3 SUGGESTED DISCOURSE GOALS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995926622222222">
We have argued that an ongoing dialog establishes
certain discourse expectations for IS and have repre-
sented these expectations as a discourse stack. We have
further claimed that elliptical fragments do not explicitly
indicate the discourse goal being pursued, and therefore
IS must intend that elliptical fragments be interpreted
according to mutually believed expectations. From our
analysis of naturally occurring dialogs, we have formu-
lated discourse expectation rules indicating how dis-
course expectations suggest the identity of IS&apos; s dis-
course goal. Associated with each discourse
expectation is a rule that suggests a set of one or more
discourse goals that IS might pursue and the order in
which they should be considered.
Suppose that IP has posed a question to IS. Then the
strongest discourse expectation is that IS will under-
stand and accept the posed question or work toward
understanding and accepting it. In order to understand a
question, the question must have been satisfactorily
transmitted. If not, IS will attempt to confirm those
components he believes may have been miscommuni-
cated; thus the first suggested discourse goal for IS
under this discourse expectation is Seek-Confirm. Once
IS believes the question has been properly transmitted,
he must be able to satisfactorily identify the referents of
the entities mentioned in the question. If he cannot do
so, he may attempt to obtain further identification of an
entity; thus the second suggested discourse goal for IS
under this discourse expectation is Seek-Identify. Once
the components of the question are understood, IS must
believe he fully comprehends what is being asked. If he
does not, he must obtain clarification of the question
before he can answer it; thus the third suggested dis-
course goal for IS under the discourse expectation of
accepting the question is Seek-Clarify-Question. Once
the question is understood, IS may refuse to accept it by
expressing surprise at an inference drawn from the
question or at the fact that the question was asked at all.
Thus the fourth suggested discourse goal under the
discourse expectation of accepting the question is Ex-
press-Surprise-Question. This leads to the following
discourse expectation ( DE) rule:
Rule DEl: The discourse expectation Accept-Ques-
tion suggests the following ordered set of discourse
goals for IS:

<listItem confidence="0.9973505">
1. Seek-Confirm
2. Seek-Identify
3. Seek-Clarify-Question
4. Express-Surprise-Question
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998610130434783">
In a cooperative dialog, once IS has understood and
accepted a question, IP expects him to answer it and is
therefore on the lookout for an answer. Therefore first
preference is given to interpretations that accomplish
this goal; thus the first discourse goals suggested for IS
in this situation are those that answer the question,
directly or indirectly. If IS is unsure of the best answer
to the question, he may suggest one or more possible
answers and request IP&apos; s help in evaluating them; thus
the second discourse goal suggested for IS is Suggest-
Answer-Question. In a cooperative dialog, we expect IS
to answer questions posed to him. If he does not do so,
he must not have sufficient knowledge to formulate a
good answer; in this case, we expect IS to work toward
being able to answer the question by gathering whatever
extra information he needs. Thus the third discourse
goal suggested for IS under the discourse expectation of
answering the question is Obtain-Information. This
analysis leads to the following discourse expectation
rule:
Rule DE2: The discourse expectation Answer Ques-
tion suggests the following partially ordered set of
discourse goals for IS:

If IS has been informing IP about certain aspects of his
underlying task-related plan, our strongest expectation
is that he will elaborate on the plan by providing further
detail. However, in an information seeking dialog, we
anticipate that IS is providing this knowledge as back-
ground information in order to help IP formulate coop-
erative responses to subsequent questions. Thus our
second expectation is that IS will request information

constructing a plan for his underlying task. This leads to

<bodyText confidence="0.997372820512821">
Other discourse expectation rules are similarly moti-
vated and formulated.
As described earlier, discourse expectations are rep-
resented in the discourse stack. These discourse expec-
tations suggest anticipated behavior for IS and are
analyzed in turn until a coherent interpretation for the
elliptical fragment is identified (Loop A in Figure 1).
The top element of the discourse stack contains the
strongest discourse expectation at the current point in
the dialog. The rule associated with this discourse
expectation is used to suggest discourse goals that IS
might pursue (steps 2 and 3 in Figure 1). Each of these
suggested discourse goals is tried in turn (Loop B in
Figure 1). If it is determined that IS is not pursuing any
of the discourse goals suggested by a discourse expec-
tation, then that discourse expectation is popped from
the discourse stack (step 14 in Figure 1) and the process
is repeated (Loop A in Figure 1) using the rule associ-
ated with the new discourse expectation now residing
on top of the stack to suggest discourse goals for IS.
Thus, for example, when IP asks IS a question, the
discourse expectations Answer-Question and Accept-
Question are successively pushed onto the discourse
stack. If IS then uses an elliptical fragment, the dis-
course expectation Accept-Question will first be used to
suggest discourse goals that IS might be pursuing.
However, if an interpretation of the fragment accom-
plishing one of these suggested discourse goals cannot
be constructed, then this discourse expectation will be
popped from the discourse stack; this indicates that IS
has understood and implicitly accepted the question
asked by IP. The top element of the stack will now be
Answer-Question and it will be used to suggest dis-
course goals that IS might be pursuing via the fragment.
(Note that although discourse expectations can be
popped from the discourse stack, a cooperative dialog
participant will never pass over the discourse goal of
answering a question. In this research, we have as-
sumed that the participants are always cooperative.)

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961336">
7.4 DISCOURSE GOAL RULES
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986690625">
We have claimed that processing of elliptical fragments
should be controlled by the discourse expectations in
effect at that point in the dialog. Discourse expectations
suggest discourse goals that IS might be expected to
pursue. If an elliptical fragment can be interpreted as
pursuing a suggested discourse goal, then this interpre-
tation of the fragment should be regarded as the one
intended by IS; otherwise IS would have overridden
these expectations, since he is aware that they will be
used in understanding his utterances.
Associated with each discourse goal is one or more
discourse goal rules (step 6 in Figure 1): each rule
applies factual and processing knowledge to analyze a
fragment and determine whether it can be understood as
pursuing the discourse goal with which the rule is
associated (Loop C in Figure 1). We view fragments as
highlighting terms or propositions in the underlying
task-related plan; recognition of the highlighted aspect
is described in the next section. The discourse goal rules
determine whether IP believes that it is mutually be-
lieved that IS might be pursuing the discourse goal
under consideration and whether the highlighted aspect
of the plan provides sufficient information for recogniz-
ing the suggested discourse goal (step 10 in Figure 1). If
so, then the elliptical fragment should be understood as
directed toward accomplishing this suggested discourse
goal and a related interpretation produced (steps 11-13
in Figure 1).
In order to demonstrate how discourse goal rules
facilitate recognition of the discourse goal that IS is
executing, let us examine how IS might seek identifica-
tion of an entity appearing in IP&apos;s utterance. Figure 2

presents two plans, Seek-Identify-1 and Seek-Identify-
2, whose primary effect is the same, namely to seek
identification of an entity. These two plans differ in that
in the body of the first plan, IS directly requests further
identification of the entity in question, whereas in the
second plan, IS attempts to determine the entity by
asking if it is the same as an entity with which he is
familiar. Now let us consider how an elliptical fragment
might be recognized as pursuing one of these plans.
Suppose we have the following dialog:
IS: &amp;quot;What CS courses are being offered during the
summer?&amp;quot;
IP: -CS105 and CS461.&amp;quot;

IS: &amp;quot;CS461?&amp;quot;
Suppose further that Seek-Identify has been suggested
as a discourse goal for IS. If IS intends IP to recognize
Seek-Identify-1 as the discourse plan that he is pursu-
ing, then he must indicate entity!, the entity whose
identification he is requesting. The elliptical fragment
&amp;quot;CS461?&amp;quot; may be understood as doing this. The appli-
cability conditions for Seek-Identify-1 specify con-
straints that must be satisfied in order for IS to pursue
this plan; only if IP believes that it is mutually believed
that these constraints are satisfied can IP infer that IS
intends him to recognize that he is pursuing this dis-
course goal. In the above dialog, IP believes that it is
mutually believed that IS wants to know the referent of
CS461 since CS461 was mentioned in IP&apos;s previous
response; it is also reasonable for IP to believe that IS
may not know the referent of CS461.
Let us examine this latter belief in greater detail. One
might ask why IP did not provide an extended descrip-
tion of CS461 in her previous response, if she believes
that IS cannot satisfactorily identify the course from its
department and number. This is not an issue with which
this paper is concerned, but we will suggest one possi-
bility. In constructing a description, IP uses knowledge
about the listener (Appelt 1985, Goodman 1986) to
produce a concise reference that she believes will be
acceptable. Sometimes she will be quite certain that the
listener will be able to identify the referent of her
description—for example, perhaps the same description
has been used successfully before. At other times, IP
will be uncertain whether the description is sufficiently
detailed; she could go to the extreme and include every
detail at her disposal, but this may confuse the listener
and hamper identification (Goodman 1986). Therefore,
if IP does not know that IS can identify the referent of
an entity from her description, she must wait for IS&apos;s
response to this description to determine its success. In
the case of the above dialog, IS does not implicitly or
explicitly accept the description (he could do this by
passing over the discourse goal of Seek-Identify) and IP
is left with the belief that her description was unsatis-
factory.
In contrast, consider the following variation of the
above dialog:
IS: &amp;quot;What courses is Dr. Jones teaching next fall?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;C5440 and CS461.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;What days is C5461 offered?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Monday evenings.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;What courses are being offered during the
summer?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;CS105 and CS461.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;CS461?&amp;quot;
It is unlikely that IS&apos;s last utterance would be inter-
preted as seeking identification of C5461. This is be-
cause IS implicitly accepted IP&apos;s first response, imply-
ing that he understood the description &amp;quot;CS461&amp;quot;, and
subsequently used it himself. This leads IP to believe
that IS can satisfactorily identify the referent of the term
&amp;quot;CS461&amp;quot;. Therefore, if IS really does want to pursue
this discourse goal, he must override IP&apos;s belief with an
utterance such as
&amp;quot;I haven&apos;t heard of C5461. What course is it?&amp;quot;
This leads to the discourse goal (DG) rule:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.881337333333333">
Rule DG-Seek-Identify-1: Check that the following
conditions are satisfied:
1. IS&apos;s elliptical fragment terminates in a
2. The fragment highlights a component of IS&apos;s
underlying task-related plan and matches a de-
scription used in the utterance by IP that is
closest to the top of the discourse stack.
3. It is mutually believed that IS might not know
the referent of this description.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991308806451613">
If these conditions are satisfied, then interpret the
fragment as seeking further identification of the high-
lighted plan component.
The first condition in the above rule checks that IS is
making a request (the body of the plan for Seek-
Identify-1 in Figure 2), the second condition checks that
IS has provided a component of his plan (which might
be the entity whose referent is the object of the request
in the Seek-Identify-1 plan in Figure 2) and that it is
reasonable to believe that he wants to know its referent
(the second applicability condition in the Seek-Identify-
1 plan in Figure 2), and the third condition checks that
IS does not already know what this referent is (the first
applicability condition in the Seek-Identify-1 plan in
Figure 2). A discourse goal rule is only invoked when
discourse expectations suggest that IS might be pursu-
ing its associated discourse goal. Therefore, if the
conditions of an invoked rule are satisfied, then IS has
provided all the information necessary for IP to believe
that IS is pursuing that goal and IP is justified in
interpreting the elliptical fragment accordingly.
Similarly, if IS intends IP to recognize Seek-Identify-
2 as the discourse plan that he is pursuing, then its
applicability conditions must be satisfied and IS must
indicate both entity! (the entity whose identification he
is requesting) and entity2 (the entity with which he is
familiar). Entity2 must be provided explicitly by the
elliptical fragment, since it is new information not
currently focused on in the dialog, and entityl implicitly
by the plan element with which the fragment is associ-
ated. This leads to the following discourse goal rule:

One might suggest using a general plan recognition
strategy to recognize discourse goals as well as domain
goals. However, such a strategy has not been ade-
quately worked out even for complete utterances, al-
though Litman&apos;s work (Litman and Allen 1987) is a
major step in this direction. Furthermore, as we argued
earlier, elliptical fragments require special treatment.
Our discourse goal rules are compilations of the kind of
reasoning that must be done on discourse plans to
ascertain if an elliptical fragment is intended to be
recognized as pursuing a suggested discourse goal.
The following are four other sample discourse goal
rules. As mentioned earlier and discussed in detail in the
next section, an elliptical fragment is viewed as high-
lighting a term T or proposition P in IS&apos;s plan, possibly
within the context of an additional set of propositions,
which we will refer to in the following rules as CON-
TEXT PROPS. For example, the fragment &amp;quot;With Dr.
Smith?&amp;quot; might highlight the proposition

but the plan inferred from the preceding dialog might
indicate that P should be interpreted within the context
of the additional propositions

If IS&apos;s discourse goal were identified as Obtain Infor-
mation, the resultant interpretation would be that IS
wants to know whether Dr. Smith is teaching a section
of C5200 next semester, not merely whether Dr. Smith
is ever teaching a section of any course. The examples
in Section 9 will illustrate the use of the following rules.

strings, or typed variables, represented as lowercase
strings preceded by the character &amp;quot;_&amp;quot; and followed by
the characters &amp;quot;:&amp;&amp;quot; and an uppercase string giving the
variable&apos;s type. These plans are hierarchical, since
many of the subgoals in a plan are nonprimitive and
therefore have associated plans that may be substituted
for them. Thus a plan can be expanded to any desired
degree of detail, by repeatedly replacing subgoals with
associated plans, which themselves contain constituent
subgoals.
We use a tree structure called a context model to
represent the task-related plan inferred for IS from the
preceding dialog. Each node in this tree represents a
goal that IS has investigated achieving and, except for
the root, is a descendant of a higher-level goal whose
associated plan contains the goal represented by the
child node. For example, in the context model shown in
Figure 3, IS is interested in achieving the subgoal of
learning the material in a section of CS300 and has
investigated learning from the instructor and learning
from the text. Since only those subgoals that have been
investigated as part of a plan for achieving a goal are
included in the context model, a goal node can have
different children in two context models derived from
different dialogs. One node in the context model is
marked as the current focus of attention and indicates
that aspect of the task on which IS&apos;s attention is
currently centered. The path from the root of the
context model to the current focus of attention is called
the active path and represents the global context, or
sequence of progressively lower-level goals that led to
the subgoal under consideration by IS. Carberry (1983,
1988) describes how the context model is dynamically
constructed from an ongoing dialog.

8.2 ASSOCIATION OF FRAGMENTS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960588235294">
We view elliptical fragments as highlighting, or calling
attention to, a term or proposition in IS&apos;s underlying
task-related plan. Given an elliptical fragment, the task-
related plan inferred for IS must be analyzed to deter-
mine, based on the current focus of attention, the
particular aspect of the plan highlighted by IS&apos;s frag-
ment. This paper will discuss three classes of elliptical
fragments; a description of how other fragments are
associated with plan elements is provided in Carberry
(1985).
We will call the matching of fragments with plan
elements association. A constant fragment can only
associate with terms whose semantic type is the same or
a superset of the semantic type of the constant. Fur-
thermore, each term in a plan has a limited set of valid
instantiations. A constant associates with a term only if
the system&apos;s beliefs indicate that IS might believe that

the uttered constant is one of the term&apos;s valid instanti-
ations. For example, if a plan contains the proposition
Starting-Date(AI-CONF, _date: &amp;DATES)
the elliptical fragment &amp;quot;February 2?&amp;quot; will associate
with the date term in this proposition only if the system
believes IS might believe that the starting date for the
Al conference is in February. Recourse to such a belief
model is necessary in order to allow for Yes-No ques-
tions to which the answer is &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; and yet eliminate
potential associations which a human listener would
recognize as unlikely. Sidner (1981) employs a similar
strategy in her work on anaphora resolution. A co-
specifier proposed by the focusing rules must be con-
firmed by an inference machine; if any contradictions
are detected, other co-specifiers are suggested.)
A propositional fragment can be of two types. The
first contains a proposition whose name is the same as
the name of a proposition in the plan domain. The
second type is a more general propositional fragment,
which cannot be associated with a specific plan-based
proposition until after analyzing the relevant proposi-
tions appearing in IS&apos;s plan. The semantic representa-
tions of the utterances
&amp;quot;Taught by Dr. Smith?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;With Dr. Smith?&amp;quot;
would produce respectively the type 1 and type 2
propositions
Teaches(SMITH, _ss: &amp;SECTIONS)
Genpred(SMITH)
The latter indicates that the name of the specific plan
proposition is as yet unknown, but that one of its
parameters must associate with the constant Smith.
A proposition of the first type associates with a
proposition of the same name if the parameters of the
propositions associate. A proposition of the second type
associates with any proposition whose parameters in-
clude terms associating with the known parameters of
the propositional fragment.
The semantic representation of a term such as &amp;quot;The
meeting time?&amp;quot; contains a variable term

<bodyText confidence="0.9994726">
Such a term associates with terms of the same semantic
type in IS&apos;s plan. Note that the existing plan may
contain constant instantiations in place of former vari-
ables. A term fragment still associates with such con-
stant terms.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.978056">
8.3 RETAINING ESTABLISHED CONTEXT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988271903225806">
It appears that humans retain as much of the established
context as possible in interpreting intersentential ellip-
sis. Carbonell (1983) demonstrated this phenomenon in
an informal poll in which users were found to interpret
the fragment in the following dialog as retaining the
fixed media specification.
IS: &apos;What is the size of the 3 largest single port fixed
media disks?&amp;quot;
IP.
IS: &amp;quot;Disks with two ports?&amp;quot;
We have noted the same phenomenon in other domains.
Thus, when an elliptical fragment is associated with a
component of the task-related plan, the context estab-
lished by the preceding dialog should be used to replace
information deleted from this streamlined, fragmentary
utterance.
As mentioned earlier, we use a context tree to
represent the underlying task-related plan inferred for
IS at this point in the dialog. The set of nodes along the
path from the root of the context tree to the current
focus of attention form a stack of goals and associated
plans, the topmost of which is the most recently con-
sidered subgoal in the current focused plan; each of
these goals is part of the plan associated with the goal
immediately beneath it in this stack. These active nodes
represent the established global context, and the prop-
ositions in these nodes can have the effect of restricting
the instantiation of variables in their ancestor nodes in
the context tree. For example, in Figure, IS&apos;s most
recently considered subgoal is attending class on Mon-
day; this restricts the sections that he is currently
considering taking to those which meet on Monday,
thus limiting the possible instantiations of the variable
_ss in the Learn From Person, Learn Material, and Earn
Credit-Section subgoals higher up on the active path.
These restrictions represent part of the context within
which the elliptical fragment occurs and, unless over-
ridden by information in the utterance itself, represent
information that is missing from the sentence fragment
but is understood by the speaker. Thus, if we use the
propositions appearing along the active path, we can
retain the restrictions on the variables in ancestor nodes
when the focus of attention pops back to them. On the
other hand, the nodes along the paths from the root of
the context tree to the nodes at which fragment ele-
ments associate with plan elements represent the new
context derived from IS&apos;s fragmentary utterance.
For example, consider the following dialog:
IS: &amp;quot;What days is CS300 taught next semester?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Two sections of CS300 meet on Monday and
one section meets on Tuesday.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;What time do the sections on Monday meet?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;One section meets on Monday at 4 pm and
another section meets on Monday at 7 pm&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;The texts?&amp;quot;
A portion of the expansion of IS&apos; s inferred task-related
plan is shown in Figure 3. Active nodes are marked by
asterisks. The semantic representation of the fragment
&amp;quot;The texts?&amp;quot; will contain the variable term _book:
&amp;TEXTS. This term associates with the term _txt:
&amp;TEXTS appearing at the node for the goal

These propositions maintain the established context—
namely, that we are talking about the sections of CS300
next semester that meet on Monday. The path from the
root of the context tree to the node at which the
elliptical fragment associates with a term in the plan
produces the additional proposition Uses(_ss:
&amp;SECTIONS,_book:&amp;TEXTS). Thus the fragment
highlights the term _book:&amp;TEXTS within the context
of the conjunction of this proposition and the nine
propositions appearing in the active nodes. (These 10
propositions are referred to as CONTEXT-PROPS in
the discourse goal rules of Section 7.4.) The semantics
of this interpretation is that IS is drawing attention to
the term _book:&amp;TEXTS such that the conjunction of
all 10 propositions is satisfied—namely, textbooks used
in sections of CS300 that meet on Monday next semes-
ter.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.968406">
8.4 IDENTIFYING THE INTENDED ASSOCIATION
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914038961039">
Within IS&apos;s task-related plan, there often are multiple
components with which a fragment might associate.
Therefore it is necessary to identify that aspect of the
plan that IS intended to draw attention to by using the
elliptical fragment. Grosz has claimed that communica-
tion can be successful only if both speaker and listener
are focused on the same subset of knowledge and if the
listener recognizes any shifts in focus by the speaker.
Grosz (1977) formulated rules for recognizing focus
shifts in apprentice-expert task dialogs. McKeown
(1985) expanded on focus rules proposed by Sidner
(1981) to explain how speakers should organize their
utterances when faced with a choice of topic.
We have investigated information-seeking dialogs in
which the information-seeker is attempting to construct
a plan for a task to be executed at some time in the
future. These dialogs are not constrained by the order of
execution of the steps of the underlying task, as in
apprentice-expert dialogs. However, such dialogs do
exhibit structure in that participants typically move
around in predictable ways to discuss different aspects
of the plan being constructed. This structure has led to
the development of focusing rules that predict how a
speaker may shift his focus of attention within the
underlying task-related plan (Carberry 1983, 1988).
An elliptical fragment by itself often contains very
little information and the fragment is likely to be misin-
terpreted if its relationship to the dialog context (repre-
sented, in our case, by the discourse stack and the
context model) is not correctly identified. But since
discrepancies in how participants view their knowledge
may exist, speakers using elliptical fragments cannot
rely on finely grained plan structures for correct inter-
pretation. Thus small shifts in focus of attention in the
context model are not significant in processing elliptical
fragments.
Although a shift in focus occurs every time one
moves from a goal to a subgoal in the goal&apos;s associated
plan, some of these moves may represent relatively
small shifts in attention while others may be quite large.
We employ the notion of focus domains in order to
group together goals that appear to be at approximately
the same level of focus when a plan is explicitly fo-
cused. Moving from one goal to another in the same
focus domain will be considered a smaller shift in
attention than moving from a goal in one focus domain
to one in a different focus domain.
In a context model, a child node will often be in the
same focus domain as its parent. However, if investi-
gating how to achieve a goal represents a significant
shift in focus from the plan that contains it, the goal is
marked in the plan library as introducing a new focus
domain. This means that all of the goal&apos;s children
(representing subgoals in its plan) will be part of a
different focus domain than the goal itself—ie., a move
from discussing the goal to considering how one would
go about achieving it represents a large shift in atten-
tion. In Figure 4, the subgoals preceded by a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; are in
a different focus domain than those preceded by an
&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;. The goals of taking a particular section of a
course, learning the material of a course, and learning
from a particular teacher all reside in the same focus
domain within the expanded plan for earning credit in a
course (and therefore are in focus to approximately the
same degree). The goal of going to the cashier&apos;s office to
pay one&apos;s tuition also appears within this expanded
plan; however, it is part of a different focus domain,
introduced by the goal of paying tuition, since it does
not come to mind nearly so readily when one thinks
about taking a course.7 The goal Pay-Tuition(IS,_cr:
&amp;CREDITS) is marked in Figure 4 as A/B, indicating
that it is in focus domain A but that it introduces focus
domain B (the goals in its associated plan are in focus
domain B).
The focusing rules use mutual beliefs about knowl-
edge currently focused on by the dialog participants and
expectations about probable shifts in focus to rank

focused within IS&apos;s underlying task-related plan at the
current time; therefore interpretations relevant to these
goals are preferred. For example, consider the following
dialog segment:
IS: &amp;quot;Who is teaching CS440?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Smith.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;What textbook is being used?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;There is no textbook. However, a set of papers
and notes have been assembled into a course
manual.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;Does the bookstore carry the course manual?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;Any faculty discounts?&amp;quot;
Faculty discounts might be available on both courses
taken by faculty and books purchased at the bookstore.
But humans interpret IS&apos;s elliptical fragment as asking
whether there is a discount for faculty purchases of the
course manual at the bookstore. This is explained by
noting that the goal of purchasing a text is part of the
current focus domain at the time the elliptical fragment
is uttered, whereas the goal of paying for the course is
not, and interpretations within the current focus domain
or its descendants are preferred over other interpreta-
tions in the overall plan. This leads to the rule:

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.882323">
Rule-Current-Focus-Domain: Associations with ele-

<bodyText confidence="0.971771756756757">
ments in the current focus domain, or within expan-
sions of the plans associated with goals in the current
focus domain, should be preferred.
Although the majority of elliptical fragments require
little shift in focus, fragments requiring significant focus
shift do occur and are generally interpreted correctly by
human dialog participants. Consider for example the
following dialog:
IS: &amp;quot;Who is teaching CS440?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Smith.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;What textbook is being used?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;There is no textbook. However, a set of notes
and papers have been assembled into a course
manual.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;Does the bookstore carry the course manual?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;3 credits?&amp;quot;
The fragment &amp;quot;3 credits?&amp;quot; should be interpreted as
asking whether CS440 is a 3 credit hour course. Pur-
chasing course materials appears as a subtask in the
plan for taking CS440, and interpreting IS&apos;s elliptical
fragment requires shifting from the focus domain asso-
ciated with this subtask to the focus domain associated
with taking CS440. This is accounted for by the expec-
tation that IS will eventually return to the higher level
plans whose expansion led to the most recently consid-
ered goal, leading to the following focus rule:
Rule-Higher-Plans: Associations with elements in the
focus domains of higher level plans whose expansion
led to the current focus domain should be preferred
over other associations with elements that do not
appear in an expansion of a goal in the current
focused domain.
Other focusing rules are similarly motivated.
Although unsignaled focus shifts may sometimes
seem awkward, human dialog participants appear to
recognize their intended meaning as long as the utter-

The fragment &amp;quot;August the _?&amp;quot; was correctly inter-

Speaker 2 would be attending the conference to which
the paper had been submitted.
In a few instances, an elliptical fragment may asso-
ciate with two alternative elements of IS&apos;s underlying
task-related plan, with the focusing heuristics rating
both equally as the association intended by the speaker.
In this case, the utterance will be interpreted as address-
ing both aspects of the speaker&apos;s plan. This is discussed
further in Carberry (1985).

9 IMPLEMENTATION AND EXAMPLES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993066666667">
A prototype system demonstrating this pragmatics-
based framework for processing intersentential ellipsis
has been implemented for a domain consisting of the
courses, policies, and requirements for students at a
university. The system is presented with a semantic
representation of an elliptical fragment, a context tree
representing the system&apos;s beliefs about the information
seeker&apos;s underlying task-related plan, a belief model
representing the system&apos;s beliefs about the information
seeker&apos;s beliefs, and an initial discourse stack contain-
ing the system&apos;s beliefs about the information seeker&apos;s
expected discourse behavior. The fragment&apos;s semantic
representation gives the structure of the fragment as
discussed in Section 8.2 and its terminating punctua-
tion. The context tree is inferred and constructed from
the preceding dialog using the incremental plan recog-
nition algorithm implemented in the TRACK system
and described in Carberry (1988). Our belief model is
very primitive and is only intended to facilitate illustra-
tion of the ellipsis processor. The belief model contains
propositions that the system believes the information-
seeker believes are satisfied. These propositions may be
fully or partially instantiated; in the latter case, they
represent the belief that the information seeker believes
the proposition can be satisfied by a constant selected
from the designated type for the argument. So, for
example, the system&apos;s belief that the information-seeker
believes that the starting date of the Al conference is in
February would be represented in the belief model by
the proposition
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.479582" genericHeader="method">
Starting Date(AI-CONF,
_date: &amp;FEBRUARY-DATES)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992421052631">
where FEBRUARY-DATES is a subclass of DATES.
The belief model also contains other beliefs, such as the
objects and types that the information-seeker knows
about and the information-seeker&apos;s beliefs about the
types of constants and about type generalization. Since
our research has not addressed issues such as how
beliefs are acquired during a dialog (Kass et al. 1987),
how they can be efficiently represented and updated in
a user model (Finin et al. 1986), or how discourse goals
are recognized from complete sentences, our implemen-
tation does not include construction of the belief model
or the discourse stack from the dialog preceding the
elliptical fragment.
The following examples illustrate our ellipsis resolu-
tion strategy .8 All rules referenced in the first example
have been described in the preceding sections. The
other examples illustrate a variety of discourse situa-
tions but, due to space limitations, are presented in less
detail than the first example.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993476864864865">
IS: &amp;quot;I want to register for a course for next semester.
But I missed pre-registration.
The cost?&amp;quot;
In this example, the first two utterances establish a plan
context of taking a course, with attention directed to the
subtask of late registering for it, and the elliptical
fragment should be interpreted as the cost of registering
late. Since proper understanding of the fragment relies
on inferred knowledge about IS&apos;s underlying task, this
example requires a plan-based interpretation.
IS&apos;s first two utterances provide information for the
system to use in inferring IS&apos;s underlying task-related
plan. An expansion of the context tree at this point in
the dialog is shown in Figure 5. In the belief model, the
only proposition about costs asserts that IS believes
that the cost of any item is of type MONEY; therefore
the system assumes that IS does not know the specific
cost of individual items. The semantic representation of
the elliptical fragment is the triple
_costl: &amp;MONEY Definite ?
specifying that the fragment is a definite noun phrase
whose head noun is of type MONEY, followed by a
question mark. Based on the dialog preceding the
elliptical fragment, the discourse stack contains the
entry Provide-For-Assimilation (discourse stack rule
SP3 in Section 7.2). Its associated discourse expectation
rule, Rule DE3, suggests that the strongest expectation
is for IS to continue providing information to the system
and that the next strongest expectation is for IS to seek
information in order to construct a plan for the task
motivating his interaction with the system. The dis-
course goal rule associated with Provide-For-Assimi-
lation, Rule DG-Provide-For-Assimilation, fails to find
an interpretation since the elliptical fragment terminates
with a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot;. Next, the discourse goal rule associated
with Obtain Information, Rule DG-Obtain-Information,
is invoked. It checks that the fragment terminates with

In the expanded context tree shown in Figure 5, the
parenthesized letters preceding goals indicate each
goal&apos;s focus domain, and nodes on the active path are
marked by asterisks. Immediately prior to IS&apos;s elliptical
fragment, the current focused plan is the plan associated
with the goal of registering late, the most recently
considered aspect of this plan is missing pre-registra-
tion, and the current focus domain contains the goals
preceded by (C). IS&apos;s fragment associates with the term
_lreg:&amp;MONEY in IS&apos;s inferred plan, as well as with
terms elsewhere in parts of the expanded plan not
shown in Figure 5. However, none of the other terms
appear in the current focus domain, and therefore the
association of the fragment with Ireg:&amp;MONEY is
selected as most relevant to the current dialog context.
The path from the root of the context model to the
current focus of attention prior to the elliptical fragment
contains the propositions

mark and is a general propositional fragment that must
associate with a plan proposition that has Smith as an
argument. The context tree immediately prior to the
elliptical fragment is shown in Figure 6, with asterisks
preceding nodes along the path from the root of the
context model to the most recently considered goal. The
belief model indicates that IS knows that Dr. Smith is
teaching a section of CS310 next semester, since this
was communicated and accepted prior to the fragment.
The top two entries of the discourse stack are
Accept-Response
Obtain-Information
indicating that IS is first expected to accept IP&apos;s re-
sponse to his previous question and then proceed to
seek further information in order to expand his under-
lying task-related plan.
The discourse expectation rule associated with Ac-
cept-Response, similar to Rule DE1, suggests discourse
goals of Seek-Confirm, Seek-Identify, and Express-
Surprise-Obtain-Corroboration. The discourse goal
rules associated with the first two of these discourse
goals fail to produce an interpretation since the frag-
ment does not associate with a term in IS&apos;s plan that

This example illustrates a situation in which multiple
expectations must be popped from the discourse stack
in processing the fragment. IP&apos;s first utterance estab-
lishes an expectation that IS will accept and answer the
question asked by IP; therefore Answer Question and
Accept-Question are pushed onto the discourse stack.
As a result of IS&apos;s first utterance, the question is
implicitly accepted, popping Accept Question from the
discourse stack. IS&apos;s first utterance is a request for
information in order to formulate an answer to IP&apos;s
posed question, resulting in the expectation that IS will
continue gathering such information; thus the expecta-
tion Obtain-Information is pushed onto the discourse
stack. IP&apos;s response answers IS&apos;s question and causes
the expectation Accept-Response to be pushed onto the
discourse stack. Thus the discourse stack passed to the
ellipsis processor contains the three entries

Obtain-Information

would replace CS310 and only the first four nodes

specifying that the fragment is a conjunction of two
propositions, followed by a period.
The discourse expectation rule associated with the
top element of the discourse stack suggests the dis-
course goals Seek-Confirm, Seek-Identify, and Express
Surprise-Obtain-Corroboration. The discourse goal
rules associated with these discourse goals require that
the fragment terminate with a question mark in order to
produce an interpretation. Since this is not the case, the
expectation Accept-Response is popped from the dis-
course stack. The new top element of the discourse
stack is Obtain-Information. Its associated discourse
expectation rule suggests the discourse goal of obtaining
further information, since once IS pursues such a dis-
course goal, he is expected to continue pursuing it with
subsequent utterances. Once again, since the fragment
terminates in a &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;, the associated discourse goal rule,
Rule DG-Obtain-Information, fails to produce an inter-
pretation, and the expectation Obtain-Information is
popped from the discourse stack.
The discourse expectation rule associated with the
expectation Answer-Question, Rule DE2, suggests,
among others, the discourse goal of answering the
question by providing restrictions on the underlying
task-related plan. Rule DG-Answer-Question-With-Re-
strictions-1 invokes plan analysis on the context tree

The main limitation of this pragmatics-based framework
appears to be in handling intersentential elliptical utter-
ances such as the following:
IS: &amp;quot;Who is the teacher of C5200?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Herd is the teacher of CS200.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;CS263?&amp;quot;
Obviously, IS&apos;s elliptical fragment requests the teacher
of CS263. Our model cannot currently handle such
fragments. This limitation is caused by our mechanisms
for retaining dialog context; they assume that IS con-
structs a plan for a task in a depth-first fashion, com-
pleting investigation of a plan for CS200 before moving
on to investigate a plan for CS263. Since the teacher of
CS200 has nothing to do with the plan for taking CS263,
the mechanisms for retaining dialog context will fail to
identify &amp;quot;teacher-of-CS263&amp;quot; as the information re-
quested by IS.
One might argue that the elliptical fragment in the
above dialog relies heavily on the syntactic representa-
tion of the preceding utterance and thus a syntactic
strategy is required for interpretation. This may be true.
However, dialogs such as the above really investigate
task-related plans in a kind of &amp;quot;breadth-first&amp;quot; fashion;
for example, in the above dialog, IS is analyzing the
teachers of each course under consideration first, and
will then move to considering other attributes of the
courses. It appears that our plan-based framework can
be extended to handle many such dialogs, by reasoning
about how IS is constructing his task-related plan
(Ramshaw 1989).
Litman (Litman et al. 1987) uses metaplans in her
formalism and is able to handle the fragment in the
above dialog. However, she views IS as changing the
plan from consideration of CS200 to CS263, not as
possibly considering several plans simultaneously. As a
result, she cannot handle fragments such as IS&apos;s last
utterance in the following dialog:
IS: &amp;quot;Who is teaching CS105?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones are teaching sections of
CS 105 . &amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;Who is teaching CS106?&amp;quot;
IP: &amp;quot;Dr. Derr is teaching CS106.&amp;quot;
IS: &amp;quot;The meeting time of Dr. Smith&apos;s section?&amp;quot;
It appears that successful handling of such fragments
requires that we consider several potential plans in
parallel and we are now considering mechanisms for
doing so.
This research has considered only interpretation of
sentence fragments. But it appears that the plan ana-
lyzer could be extended to provide information missing
from a syntactically complete sentence. For example,
suppose IS asked:
&amp;quot;Who is teaching CS300 on Monday next semes-
ter?&amp;quot;
and then subsequently asked:
&amp;quot;What textbooks will be used?&amp;quot;
The plan analyzer could identify both the element of the
user&apos;s plan that associates with the incompletely spec-
ified proposition UsesPred(Unknown,_txtATEXTS)
appearing in the semantic representation of the user&apos;s
utterance and the context within which the association
occurs. This would enable the system to recognize that
IS wants to know the texts used by sections of CS300
that meet next semester on Monday. This is similar to
interpreting the elliptical fragment &amp;quot;The texts?&amp;quot; in
Section 8.3. A related problem, that of understanding
pragmatically ill-formed utterances (utterances that vi-
olate the system&apos;s model of the world), is addressed in
Carberry (1988).

This research has investigated the use of pragmatic
knowledge in understanding intersentential ellipsis oc-
curring during an information seeking dialog in a task
domain. Our ellipsis resolution strategy uses many
pragmatic knowledge sources, including the information
seeker&apos;s inferred task-related plan, his inferred beliefs,
his anticipated discourse goals, and focusing strategies.
However, we do not contend that a natural language
system should use only pragmatic knowledge; a robust
system will need to coordinate syntactic, semantic, and
pragmatic techniques in order to fully understand the
wide variety of elliptical utterances employed in human
communication.
Real understanding necessitates identifying the
speaker&apos;s discourse or communicative goal in uttering
an elliptical fragment. We claim that a speaker who uses
an elliptical fragment is relying heavily on discourse
expectations and that such fragments are often used to
accomplish discourse goals that must be marked if a
complete sentence is used. Our work is the first to
address the problem of recognizing the discourse goal
fulfilled by an elliptical utterance. Our research shows
that an ellipsis interpretation strategy controlled by
discourse expectations and utilizing focusing heuristics
facilitates recognition of the speaker&apos;s intent in uttering
an intersentential elliptical fragment, including identifi-
cation of his discourse goal.

NOTES
1. Taken from Flowers and Dyer (1984).
2. A speech act is an action performed with an utterance, such as the
acts of informing and making a promise, although other require-
ments may need to be met for the action to be successfully
executed (Austin 1962).
3. Thanks to Ralph Weischedel for this example.
4. These transcripts were provided by the Department of Computer
Science of the University of Pennsylvania.
5. These rules capture the behavior exhibited in the dialogs we
studied. However, we have no experiments to indicate whether
the model is psychologically valid.
6. Note that -1 Believe(IS, 1 P)44 Believe(IS,P)
7. This is similar to Grosz&apos;s focus spaces and the notion of an object
being in implicit focus.
8. Some stack processing rules that were not discussed in Section
7.2 would influence the discourse stack but not affect how the
elliptical fragments in the examples are understood. They have
been omitted to keep the presentation short and to focus attention
on the important aspects of the ellipsis processing strategy.

This paper presents a pragmatics-based framework for interpreting such utterances. Discourse expectations and focusing heuristics are used to facilitate recognition of an information-seeker&apos;s intent in uttering an elliptical fragment. The ellipsis is comprehended by identifying both the aspect of the information-seeker&apos;s task-related plan highlighted by the fragment and the conversational discourse goal fulfilled by the utterance. The contribution of this approach is its consideration of pragmatic information, including discourse content and conversational goals, rather than just the precise representation of the preceding utterance.</abstract>

Let us examine this latter belief in greater detail. One might ask why IP did not provide an extended description of CS461 in her previous response, if she believes that IS cannot satisfactorily identify the course from its department and number. This is not an issue with which this paper is concerned, but we will suggest one possibility. In constructing a description, IP uses knowledge about the listener (Appelt 1985, Goodman 1986) to produce a concise reference that she believes will be acceptable. Sometimes she will be quite certain that the listener will be able to identify the referent of her description—for example, perhaps the same description has been used successfully before. At other times, IP will be uncertain whether the description is sufficiently detailed; she could go to the extreme and include every detail at her disposal, but this may confuse the listener and hamper identification (Goodman 1986).

The listener, in attempting to deduce the speaker&apos;s intent, will be guided by Grice&apos;s conversational maxims (Grice 1975). In particular, Grice&apos;s maxims of manner and relation suggest that the speaker believes his utterance is an adequate vehicle for conveying his intentions and that the utterance is relevant to the current dialog. A cooperative listener will have assimilated the preceding dialog, inferred much of the underlying task-related plan motivating the speaker&apos;s queries, and be focused on that aspect of the task on which the information-seeker&apos;s attention was centered (Grosz 1977; Carberry 1983; Carberry 1988) immediately prior to the new utterance. Given an incomplete utterance, the listener can use this acquired knowledge to attempt to deduce the speaker&apos;s intentions by trying to fit the utterance into the partially constructed plan, and thereby enable the dialog to continue without interruption.

Focusing techniques (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1981; Robinson 1981; McKeown 1985; Carberry 1988) are necessary in order to identify that portion of the underlying plan to which a fragmentary utterance refers. Consider again the dialog in Example 3. The focus of attention in this dialog is on considering the job applicants and evaluating them; therefore IS is most expected to continue with this subtask before considering other aspects of his overall task (Carberry 1983, 1988). As a result, IS&apos;s fragmentary utterance &amp;quot;Tom&apos;s recommendation?&amp;quot; will be understood as a request for Tom&apos;s opinion about the suitability of the job applicants for the job of programming consultant. However, if the focus of attention were instead on determining the number of consultants needed, then IS&apos;s fragmentary utterance would be understood differently. 5 FRAMEWORK FOR PROCESSING ELLIPSIS If an utterance is parsed as a sentence fragment, ellipsis processing begins.

One node in the context model is marked as the current focus of attention and indicates that aspect of the task on which IS&apos;s attention is currently centered. The path from the root of the context model to the current focus of attention is called the active path and represents the global context, or sequence of progressively lower-level goals that led to the subgoal under consideration by IS. Carberry (1983, 1988) describes how the context model is dynamically constructed from an ongoing dialog. 8.2 ASSOCIATION OF FRAGMENTS We view elliptical fragments as highlighting, or calling attention to, a term or proposition in IS&apos;s underlying task-related plan. Given an elliptical fragment, the taskrelated plan inferred for IS must be analyzed to determine, based on the current focus of attention, the particular aspect of the plan highlighted by IS&apos;s fragment.

These dialogs are not constrained by the order of execution of the steps of the underlying task, as in apprentice-expert dialogs. However, such dialogs do exhibit structure in that participants typically move around in predictable ways to discuss different aspects of the plan being constructed. This structure has led to the development of focusing rules that predict how a speaker may shift his focus of attention within the underlying task-related plan (Carberry 1983, 1988). An elliptical fragment by itself often contains very little information and the fragment is likely to be misinterpreted if its relationship to the dialog context (represented, in our case, by the discourse stack and the context model) is not correctly identified. But since discrepancies in how participants view their knowledge may exist, speakers using elliptical fragments cannot rely on finely grained plan structures for correct interpretation. Thus small shifts in focus of attention in the context model are not significant in processing elliptical fragments. Although a shift in focu</context>

Given an elliptical fragment, the taskrelated plan inferred for IS must be analyzed to determine, based on the current focus of attention, the particular aspect of the plan highlighted by IS&apos;s fragment. This paper will discuss three classes of elliptical fragments; a description of how other fragments are associated with plan elements is provided in Carberry (1985). We will call the matching of fragments with plan elements association. A constant fragment can only associate with terms whose semantic type is the same or a superset of the semantic type of the constant. Furthermore, each term in a plan has a limited set of valid instantiations. A constant associates with a term only if the system&apos;s beliefs indicate that IS might believe that Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 2, June 1989 87 Sandra Carberry A Pragmatics-Based Approach to Ellipsis Resolution the uttered constant is one of the term&apos;s valid instantiations.

In a few instances, an elliptical fragment may associate with two alternative elements of IS&apos;s underlying task-related plan, with the focusing heuristics rating both equally as the association intended by the speaker. In this case, the utterance will be interpreted as addressing both aspects of the speaker&apos;s plan. This is discussed further in Carberry (1985). 9 IMPLEMENTATION AND EXAMPLES A prototype system demonstrating this pragmaticsbased framework for processing intersentential ellipsis has been implemented for a domain consisting of the courses, policies, and requirements for students at a university. The system is presented with a semantic representation of an elliptical fragment, a context tree representing the system&apos;s beliefs about the information seeker&apos;s underlying task-related plan, a belief model representing the system&apos;s beliefs about the information seeker&apos;s beliefs, and an initial discourse stack containing the system&apos;s beliefs ab</context>

Plan recognition strategies are essential in order to infer a model of the speaker&apos;s underlying task-related plan, shown earlier to be an essential component of factual knowledge, and to consider possible expansions of that plan when processing elliptical fragments. Focusing techniques (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1981; Robinson 1981; McKeown 1985; Carberry 1988) are necessary in order to identify that portion of the underlying plan to which a fragmentary utterance refers. Consider again the dialog in Example 3. The focus of attention in this dialog is on considering the job applicants and evaluating them; therefore IS is most expected to continue with this subtask before considering other aspects of his overall task (Carberry 1983, 1988).

The fragment&apos;s semantic representation gives the structure of the fragment as discussed in Section 8.2 and its terminating punctuation. The context tree is inferred and constructed from the preceding dialog using the incremental plan recognition algorithm implemented in the TRACK system and described in Carberry (1988). Our belief model is very primitive and is only intended to facilitate illustration of the ellipsis processor. The belief model contains propositions that the system believes the informationseeker believes are satisfied. These propositions may be fully or partially instantiated; in the latter case, they represent the belief that the information seeker believes the proposition can be satisfied by a constant selected from the designated type for the argument. So, for example, the system&apos;s belief that the information-seeker believes that the starting date of the Al conference is in February woul</context>

In many cases, these utterances cannot be understood in isolation, but must be interpreted within the established context. Precisely how this should be done is a difficult problem for natural language systems. One might suggest that the problem be avoided in man-machine communication by training human users to employ only syntactically and semantically complete utterances. However, this does not appear to be feasible, as demonstrated in an empirical study conducted by Carbonell (1983) in which it was shown that human users find it easy to avoid complex syntactic structures but difficult to avoid incomplete utterances. Even if it were possible to train users to avoid incomplete utterances, these restrictions would be undesirable. Constraining man-machine communication to only a subset of the utterances normally employed by humans would force users to give less attention to their problem solving goals in order to concentrate more on the preciseness of their utterances. In addition, it appears that fragmentary utterances are not merely a result of sloppy communication. Althou</context>

In addition, Litman&apos;s metaplans (such as Introduce-Plan, Continue-Plan, and ModifyPlan) are more like plan construction metaplans than metaplans representing communicative goals such as expressing surprise or seeking clarification of a question. We contend that recognition of the speaker&apos;s discourse or communicative goal must be an integral part of any strategy that really understands ellipsis. In addition to the syntactic, semantic, and plan-based strategies, a few other heuristics have been devised. Carbonell (1983) used rules that suggested a set of expected user utterances and related elliptical fragments to these expected patterns. For example, if the system asked the user whether a particular value should be used as the filler of a slot in a case frame, the system then expected the user&apos;s utterance to contain a confirmation or disconfirmation pattern, a different filler for the slot, a comparative pattern such as &amp;quot;too hard&amp;quot;, and so forth. Although these rules use expectations about how the speaker might respond, they seem to have little to do with the expected discourse goals of the speaker; as a res</context>

The semantic representation of a term such as &amp;quot;The meeting time?&amp;quot; contains a variable term _tme: &amp;MTG-TIMES Such a term associates with terms of the same semantic type in IS&apos;s plan. Note that the existing plan may contain constant instantiations in place of former variables. A term fragment still associates with such constant terms. 8.3 RETAINING ESTABLISHED CONTEXT It appears that humans retain as much of the established context as possible in interpreting intersentential ellipsis. Carbonell (1983) demonstrated this phenomenon in an informal poll in which users were found to interpret the fragment in the following dialog as retaining the fixed media specification. IS: &apos;What is the size of the 3 largest single port fixed media disks?&amp;quot; IP. IS: &amp;quot;Disks with two ports?&amp;quot; We have noted the same phenomenon in other domains. Thus, when an elliptical fragment is associated with a component of the task-related plan, the context established by the preceding dialog should be used to replace information deleted from this streamlined, fragmentary utterance.

If these conditions are satisfied, then interpret the fragment as answering yes, with the restriction that the proposition (P A CONTEXT-PROPS) be satisfied in the underlying plan. 8 PLAN ANALYSIS 8.1 REPRESENTATION OF PLANS We view a plan as the means by which an agent can accomplish a nonprimitive, task-related goal. Plans are represented, using an extended STRIPS formalism (Fikes and Nilsson 1971; Allen et al. 1980), as structures containing applicability conditions, preconditions, a plan body, and effects. The plan body is a decomposition of the plan&apos;s goal into a set of simpler subgoals, each of which can be accomplished by a primitive action or itself has an associated domain plan. Arguments in plans are either constants, represented as uppercase 86 Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 2, June 1989 A Pragmatics-Based Approach to Ellipsis Resolution Sandra Carberry *Earn-Credit(IS, CS300, NEXT SEMESTER, _cn&amp;CREDITS) where Course-Offered(CS300, NEXT SEMESTER) Credits-Of(CS300</context>

Let us examine this latter belief in greater detail. One might ask why IP did not provide an extended description of CS461 in her previous response, if she believes that IS cannot satisfactorily identify the course from its department and number. This is not an issue with which this paper is concerned, but we will suggest one possibility. In constructing a description, IP uses knowledge about the listener (Appelt 1985, Goodman 1986) to produce a concise reference that she believes will be acceptable. Sometimes she will be quite certain that the listener will be able to identify the referent of her description—for example, perhaps the same description has been used successfully before. At other times, IP will be uncertain whether the description is sufficiently detailed; she could go to the extreme and include every detail at her disposal, but this may confuse the listener and hamper identification (Goodman 1986). Therefore, if IP does not know that IS can identify the referent of an entity from her description, she must </context>

We claim that the requisite factual knowledge includes the speaker&apos;s inferred task-related plan, the speaker&apos;s inferred beliefs, and the anticipated discourse goals of the speaker; we claim that the requisite processing knowledge includes plan recognition strategies and focusing techniques. 4.1 TASK-RELATED PLAN According to Grice (1957,1969), a listener must infer a speaker&apos;s intent in making an utterance. Now consider an incomplete utterance. The listener, in attempting to deduce the speaker&apos;s intent, will be guided by Grice&apos;s conversational maxims (Grice 1975). In particular, Grice&apos;s maxims of manner and relation suggest that the speaker believes his utterance is an adequate vehicle for conveying his intentions and that the utterance is relevant to the current dialog. A cooperative listener will have assimilated the preceding dialog, inferred much of the underlying task-related plan motivating the speaker&apos;s queries, and be focused on that aspect of the task on which the information-seeker&apos;s attention was centered (Grosz 1977; Carberry 1983; Carberry 1988) immediately prior to the new utterance.

The discourse goal itself is content independent, although its realization in an utterance will involve some term or proposition from the speaker&apos;s underlying task-related plan. For example, the discourse goal Express-Surprise-Obtain-Corroboration represents a speaker&apos;s attempt to convey to his listener that he is surprised at some proposition P and would like justification of it. A number of researchers have contended that a coherent discourse consists of segments that are related to one another. The structuring relations have been given many names, including rhetorical predicates (Grimes 1975, McKeown 1985), coherence relations (Hobbs 1979), discourse segment purposes (Grosz 1986), and conversational moves (Reichman 1984). Our concept of discourse goals is closest to Grosz and Sidner&apos;s discourse segment purposes and Reichman&apos;s conversational moves. Grosz and Sidner define a discourse segment purpose as the intended role of a discourse segment in achieving an overall discourse purpose. They contend that the discourse segment successfully serves its intended function only if the discourse segment purpose is recognized by the listener.

Plan recognition strategies are essential in order to infer a model of the speaker&apos;s underlying task-related plan, shown earlier to be an essential component of factual knowledge, and to consider possible expansions of that plan when processing elliptical fragments. Focusing techniques (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1981; Robinson 1981; McKeown 1985; Carberry 1988) are necessary in order to identify that portion of the underlying plan to which a fragmentary utterance refers. Consider again the dialog in Example 3. The focus of attention in this dialog is on considering the job applicants and evaluating them; therefore IS is most expected to continue with this subtask before considering other aspects of his overall task (Carberry 1983, 1988). As a result, IS&apos;s fragmentary utterance &amp;quot;Tom&apos;s recommendation?&amp;quot; will be understood as a request for Tom&apos;s opinion about the suitability of the job applicants</context>

Therefore it is necessary to identify that aspect of the plan that IS intended to draw attention to by using the elliptical fragment. Grosz has claimed that communication can be successful only if both speaker and listener are focused on the same subset of knowledge and if the listener recognizes any shifts in focus by the speaker. Grosz (1977) formulated rules for recognizing focus shifts in apprentice-expert task dialogs. McKeown (1985) expanded on focus rules proposed by Sidner (1981) to explain how speakers should organize their utterances when faced with a choice of topic. We have investigated information-seeking dialogs in which the information-seeker is attempting to construct a plan for a task to be executed at some time in the future. These dialogs are not constrained by the order of execution of the steps of the underlying task, as in apprentice-expert dialogs. However, such dialogs do exhibit structure in that participant</context>

As shown by Grosz (1979), a speaker may pursue several different kinds of goals with a single utterance. For example, an information-seeker has the long-term goal of performing a task comprised of subtasks; this hierarchical structure produces a set of task-related goals. The information seeker is attempting to construct a plan for his underlying task, resulting in plan formation goals. In addition, each utterance pursues a more immediate discourse goal, such as requesting information or seeking clarification.

Since IS cannot be surprised about something he doesn&apos;t know, a different intention or discourse goal is attributed to him. Allen and Perrault (Perrault et al. 1980) used mutual beliefs in their work on indirect speech acts and suggested their use in clarification and correction dialogs. Sidner (1983, 1985) models user beliefs about system capabilities in her work on recognizing speaker intention in utterances. Mutual beliefs appear to be a major influence on how human listeners interpret and respond to utterances. 4.3 DISCOURSE EXPECTATIONS A number of researchers (Sacks et al. 1974; Labov and Fanshel 1977; Mann et al. 1977) have noted regularities in dialog and have attempted to capture these regularities in knowledge structures that can be used for comprehending utterances. For example, Mann, Moore, and Levin (Mann et al. 1977) used a knowledge structure called a dialog game to model goal-related use of language in joint interactions such as buying/selling and learning/teaching. Grosz and Sidner (Grosz et al. 1986) and Reichman (1984) have investigated discourse structure and have shown that a coherent discourse can be segmented into units that have well-defined relationships to one another. </context>

For isolated sentence fragments in his restricted domain of train arrivals and departures, Allen&apos;s interpretation strategy worked well. To understand elliptical fragments during a dialog in a more complex domain, it is necessary to identify the particular aspect of the speaker&apos;s overall task-related plan addressed by the fragment and recognize the discourse or communicative goal being pursued. More recently, Litman (1986) developed a plan-based theory that incorporates both domain plans and metaplans to understand utterances. Similar to Allen, Litman used syntactic clues in the utterance to postulate speech acts &amp;quot;request&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;inform&amp;quot; that an elliptical fragment was intended to accomplish, and she then attempted to construct an inference path from a postulated speech act to the plan inferred for the speaker. However, it appears that Litman&apos;s system would handle an elliptical fragment such as &amp;quot;With 269 people on board?&amp;quot; from Example 1 in much the same way as the complete sentence &amp;quot;Did the Korean jet have 269 peo</context>

In particular, IS&apos;s fragment describes an entity with which he is familiar and asks whether this entity and the highlighted plan component are the same. One might suggest using a general plan recognition strategy to recognize discourse goals as well as domain goals. However, such a strategy has not been adequately worked out even for complete utterances, although Litman&apos;s work (Litman and Allen 1987) is a major step in this direction. Furthermore, as we argued earlier, elliptical fragments require special treatment. Our discourse goal rules are compilations of the kind of reasoning that must be done on discourse plans to ascertain if an elliptical fragment is intended to be recognized as pursuing a suggested discourse goal. The following are four other sample discourse goal rules. As mentioned earlier and discussed in detail in the next section, an elliptical fragment is viewed as highlighting a term T or proposition P in IS&apos;s plan, possibly within the context of an additional set of prop</context>

Plan recognition strategies are essential in order to infer a model of the speaker&apos;s underlying task-related plan, shown earlier to be an essential component of factual knowledge, and to consider possible expansions of that plan when processing elliptical fragments. Focusing techniques (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1981; Robinson 1981; McKeown 1985; Carberry 1988) are necessary in order to identify that portion of the underlying plan to which a fragmentary utterance refers. Consider again the dialog in Example 3. The focus of attention in this dialog is on considering the job applicants and evaluating them; therefore IS is most expected to continue with this subtask before considering other aspects of his overall task (Carberry 1983, 1988). As a result, IS&apos;s fragmentary utterance &amp;quot;Tom&apos;s recommendation?&amp;quot; will be understood as a request for Tom&apos;s opinion about the suitability of the job applicants for the job of programming consultant.

A number of researchers have contended that a coherent discourse consists of segments that are related to one another. The structuring relations have been given many names, including rhetorical predicates (Grimes 1975, McKeown 1985), coherence relations (Hobbs 1979), discourse segment purposes (Grosz 1986), and conversational moves (Reichman 1984). Our concept of discourse goals is closest to Grosz and Sidner&apos;s discourse segment purposes and Reichman&apos;s conversational moves.

Therefore it is necessary to identify that aspect of the plan that IS intended to draw attention to by using the elliptical fragment. Grosz has claimed that communication can be successful only if both speaker and listener are focused on the same subset of knowledge and if the listener recognizes any shifts in focus by the speaker. Grosz (1977) formulated rules for recognizing focus shifts in apprentice-expert task dialogs. McKeown (1985) expanded on focus rules proposed by Sidner (1981) to explain how speakers should organize their utterances when faced with a choice of topic. We have investigated information-seeking dialogs in which the information-seeker is attempting to construct a plan for a task to be executed at some time in the future.

This claim that the speaker&apos;s underlying task-related plan is an essential component of an ellipsis interpretation strategy is further supported by research demonstrating the need for considering such plans in understanding other types of utterances.

In the latter case, IP believes it is mutually believed that IS does not know IP&apos;s beliefs about the meeting time of CS400. Since IS cannot be surprised about something he doesn&apos;t know, a different intention or discourse goal is attributed to him. Allen and Perrault (Perrault et al. 1980) used mutual beliefs in their work on indirect speech acts and suggested their use in clarification and correction dialogs. Sidner (1983, 1985) models user beliefs about system capabilities in her work on recognizing speaker intention in utterances. Mutual beliefs appear to be a major influence on how human listeners interpret and respond to utterances. 4.3 DISCOURSE EXPECTATIONS A number of researchers (Sacks et al. 1974; Labov and Fanshel 1977; Mann et al. 1977) have noted regularities in dialog and have attempted to capture these regularities in knowledge structures that can be used for comprehending utterances. For example, Mann, Moore, and Levin (Mann et al. 1977) used a knowledge structure called a dialog game to model g</context>

We have selected this class of dialogs because they are typical of a large percentage of the interactions with database management systems, decision support systems, and expert systems. However, the principles presented in this paper should be extendible to other kinds of dialogs. Our hypotheses and strategies were motivated by an analysis of naturally occurring dialogs from several domains, including a radio call-in show4 providing advice on investments, interactions with the REL (Thompson 1980) natural language interface to a ship data base, and student advisement sessions. We are assuming that the natural language system plays the role of information-provider and that communication is via a typical terminal.

However, many examples of ellipsis cannot be handled by syntactic strategies. Consider again the dialog presented in Example 2. No transformation or modification of Speaker l&apos;s first statement will produce an utterance that represents the intended meaning of Speaker l&apos;s elliptical fragment. The second potential strategy uses the semantic representation of the last utterance as a pattern that suggests slots for which an elliptical fragment may provide a filler or a substitution. Semantic strategies are presented in Waltz (1978) and Carbonell (1983). However, semantic strategies require an extensive case 76 Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 2, June 1989 Sandra Carberry A Pragmatics-Based Approach to Ellipsis Resolution frame representation and are inadequate for handling elliptical fragments that rely on an assumed communication of the underlying task.
