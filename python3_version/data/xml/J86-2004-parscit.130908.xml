&amp;quot;Phonology and Syntax&amp;quot;, unqualified, suggests a general
treatment of these two topics which always seem so sepa-
rate in method and logic. The subtitle hints that the
author may revere the syntactic tradition, because
phonology is sound but syntax has structure.
The title, the size of the book, and the author&apos;s previ-
ous work should excite any reader who is waiting for a
natural language interface that really uses voice or is
working on a speech processing system that understands
what is being said. I was eager for an opportunity to
study this book. Integrating, or even gracefully interfac-
ing, the discourse/semantics/syntax stuff with the
phonetics/phonology/prosodics stuff has yet to be done
in a satisfying way.
The author&apos;s view: The &amp;quot;standard theory&amp;quot; of the
phonology-syntax relation has been outlined in Chomsky
and Halle&apos;s Sound Pattern of English (1968), but is now
in need of revision. The author&apos;s &amp;quot;revised theory&apos; of the
phonological representation is that it consists of (a) a
prosodic constituent structure (including a sequence of
syllables), (b) a set of autosegmental tiers, (c) a rhythmic
structure, the metrical grid, and (d) a specification of the
associations or alignments between these various aspects
of the representation. The &apos;revised theory&apos; of the relation
between syntax and phonology is that it is a mapping
from a syntactic representation into a fully specified
phonological representation with these properties&amp;quot; (p. 8).
Sandwiched between the introductory and concluding
chapters are six chapters that treat selected aspects of
phonological representation. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 intro-
duce metrical grids and apply them to word stress and to
phrasal rhythm. The fifth chapter treats pitch accents and
intonation; the sixth is about syntactic junctures and
timing; and the seventh concerns cliticization of function
words. Each chapter is about 50 pages long, and there
are 30 pages of footnotes.
The negative view: Selkirk is fashion-conscious. She
tries on pieces of several popular trends in phonology,
without facing the conceptual and methodological clashes
that result. On the other hand, she does not challenge
the core concepts of the &amp;quot;standard theory&amp;quot; either. She
attempts to unify some positive contributions of autoseg-
mental, metrical, and lexical phonology, and the re-e-
merging pitch-accent view of intonation. Selkirk&apos;s
obvious appreciation of these new directions gets in the
way of developing her own independent and coherent
view. Selkirk does not take this book-length opportunity
to clarify recent phonological history. Most of the topics
covered in the book are more clearly presented in the
original sources (e.g. Liberman and Prince 1977, or
Pierrehumbert 1980). The book is quite hard to read and
seems not to have had the benefit of proper editing.
There may be important insights that are obscured by the
intricate prose, or it may be that some of the ideas are so
intricate they cannot be expressed clearly. (She has a
parenthetical remark (on page 387) that is interrupted by
two long (am I really doing this?) embedded parenthe-
ticals.)
The positive view: Chapters 6 and 7 make the book
worthwhile. After the obeisant filigree of chapters 1
through 5, Selkirk gets down to a couple of topics of her
own. As with the rest of the book, her writing shows an
intense involvement with the subject, but in chapters 6
and 7 the style is simpler, the argument is clearer, and the
attitude is more modest. Chapter 6 argues that &amp;quot;an
abstract phonological representation of [timing] is
converted into a phonetic reprpsentation ... that provides
explicit quantitative information about the duration of
segments and pauses.&amp;quot; (p. 300) This view is counter-
posed to Klatt&apos;s work and especially Cooper&apos;s work on
timing. Selkirk&apos;s argument is appealing enough that I was
tempted to get out of my chair and run an experiment.
Chapter 7 treats the de-stressing and reduction of func-
tion words. Although I can&apos;t accept some of the
purported data or the mode of analysis, Selkirk&apos;s is the
best treatment of the topic that I can remember having
seen. In fact, chapters 6 and 7 form a nice 110-page
monograph. The work is original and the attitude is
open; if the first five chapters had to come out first, so be
it.
