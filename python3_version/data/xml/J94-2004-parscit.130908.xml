Third-person fictional narrative text is composed not only of passages that objectively narrate
events, but also of passages that present characters&apos; thoughts, perceptions, and inner states.
Such passages take a character&apos;s psychological point of view. A language understander
must determine the current psychological point of view in order to distinguish the beliefs of the
characters from the facts of the story, to correctly attribute beliefs and other attitudes to their
sources, and to understand the discourse relations among sentences. Tracking the psychological
point of view is not a trivial problem, because many sentences are not explicitly marked for point
of view, and whether the point of view of a sentence is objective or that of a character (and if the
latter, which character it is) often depends on the context in which the sentence appears. Tracking
the psychological point of view is the problem addressed in this work. The approach is to seek, by
extensive examinations of naturally occurring narrative, regularities in the ways that authors
manipulate point of view, and to develop an algorithm that tracks point of view on the basis of the
regularities found. This paper presents this algorithm, gives demonstrations of an implemented
system, and describes the results of some preliminary empirical studies, which lend support to
the algorithm.

be able to get home from this strange desert land into which they had
been cast and which was heaven knew where in all the countless solar
systems in all the countless galaxies? [L&apos;Engle, Many Waters, p. 91]
In this passage, the author is not objectively narrating events or describing the fictional
world, but is presenting the thoughts and emotions of a character. It is to Sandy that
the land is strange, and it is Sandy&apos;s uncertainty that is expressed by the question and
the expression &apos;heaven knew where.&apos; Unless the language understander realizes these
things, it hasn&apos;t fully understood the passage.
Passages such as (1) take a character&apos;s psychological point of view and are com-
posed of subjective sentences—sentences that present the thoughts, perceptions, and
inner states of characters in the story. Notice that nothing in (1.2) explicitly specifies
that the sentence is Sandy&apos;s thought. In general, only a narrative parenthetical, such
as &apos;Dennys thought&apos; in (2), serves to explicitly indicate both that a sentence is subjective
and who its subjective character is.

In all other cases, one must rely on less direct sources of information to determine the
psychological point of view.
This paper presents an algorithm for recognizing subjective sentences and identi-
fying their subjective characters in third-person fictional narrative text. The algorithm
is based on regularities, found by extensive examination of naturally occurring text
(i.e., published novels and short stories) in the ways that authors manipulate point of
view. It has been implemented, and some preliminary empirical studies, which lend
support to the algorithm, have also been performed.
The algorithm is described in the body of the paper and is given in full in Ap-
pendix A. Sections 2-5 give background information and describe my approach to the
problem. Sections 6 and 7 present an overview of the algorithm, specifying the input
and output of the basic components and identifying the components focused on in this
work. Sections 8-10 present the bulk of the algorithm, addressing the problem of iden-
tifying subjective characters before the problem of recognizing subjective sentences.
Section 11 describes the algorithm&apos;s treatment of sentences about private-state actions,
such as sighing and looking. Sections 12-14 conclude the paper with a summary of
tests of the algorithm and discussions of the relationship between tracking point of
view and anaphora resolution and of directions for future research. The algorithm is
given in Appendix A, demonstrations of its implementation are given in Appendix B,
and the results of a test of the algorithm are given in Appendix C.

2.1 Introduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999555">
In face-to-face conversation, an utterance is understood with respect to the situation in
which the conversation takes place (Barwise and Perry 1983). Thus, deictic expressions
such as snow,&apos; here,&amp;quot;come,&amp;quot;go,&apos; and &apos;just ahead&apos; derive their meanings from the
time and place of the utterance (Fillmore 1975; Lyons 1977). In fictional narrative text,
however, spatial and temporal deictic terms are clearly not understood with respect to
the time and place of the author&apos;s writing nor of the reader&apos;s reading. Rather, they are
understood with respect to a &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; within the story (Hamburger 1973;
Kuroda 1976; Baufield 1982; Bruder et al. 1986; Rapaport et al. 1989a, 1989b). Thus,
the reader must track the spatial and temporal points of view with respect to which
objects and events are described (Uspensky 1973).
Knowing who the speaker is another situational component needed to understand
conversation. Most obviously, the speaker is needed as the referent of first-person pro-
nouns, but in addition she is the source of beliefs, emotions, evaluations, etc., expressed
by her utterances. But in third-person narrative text, sentences can express a charac-
ter&apos;s beliefs, emotions, etc., even when he or she is referred to in the third person.
Thus, an additional deictic component, corresponding to the speaker in conversation,
is needed to understand third-person narrative: the psychological point of view (Us-
pensky 1973).
Although various points of view often coincide in third-person narrative text, they
need not. For example, a passage may take a character&apos;s spatial and temporal points
of view without taking the psychological point of view of any character (Uspensky
1973). It is the psychological point of view we are concerned with in this paper.

2.2 Subjective Sentences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999061">
Following Ann Banfield (1982), a literary theorist who analyzes point of view lin-
guistically, we shall call sentences that take a character&apos;s psychological point of view
(hereafter, simply point of view or POV) subjective, in contrast to sentences that ob-
jectively narrate events or describe the fictional world. Subjective sentences present
private states of characters—states of an experiencer holding an attitude, optionally
toward an object. Varieties of private states include intellectual ones, such as someone
believing, wondering, or knowing something; emotive ones, such as someone hating
something or being afraid; and perceptual ones, such as someone seeing or hearing
something. Thus, private states are states that are not open to objective observation
or verification (Quirk et al. 1985). To refer to a private state p and its components, we
shall write:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.709188">
Ps (p,experiencer,attitude,object)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983043478261">
where experiencer is the person in state p, and attitude is know, believe, see, or whatever
sort of private state p is. Notice that &amp;quot;attitude&amp;quot; is being used as a general covering
term, referring to a class of which the propositional attitudes are only a subclass.
We shall limit our scope in this paper mainly to two classes of subjective sen-
tences, one containing those Banfield calls &amp;quot;represented thoughts&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;represented
perceptions,&amp;quot; and the other containing those I call &amp;quot;private-state reports.&amp;quot; We will not
consider represented speech at all (Jespersen 1924; Banfield 1982), because of its com-
plexity, and only toward the end of the paper (Section 11) will we consider a variant
of private-state reports: subjective sentences about private-state actions.
Even restricting one&apos;s attention to the two classes mentioned above, there are many
syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic features according to which one could characterize
subjective sentences. Below I propose a view of subjective sentences that is useful
for the specific purpose of tracking FOV. For characterizations that include further
and alternative distinctions, see, for example, the following works in literary theory
and linguistics: Dole2e1 1973; Uspensky 1973; Fillmore 1974; Cohn 1978; Banfield 1982;
Caenepeel 1989; Galbraith 1990; Li 1991.
A private state is part of the meaning of any kind of subjective sentence. However,
a represented thought or represented perception without a narrative parenthetical
explicitly mentions only the object of the private state; the attitude and experiencer are
implicit. On the other hand, a private-state report explicitly mentions the experiencer,
the attitude, and, optionally, the object of a private state p; in addition, with the private-
state report, p is not the object of some other private state with an implicit experiencer
and attitude. Consider the following sentences:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.453218">
31 Zoe was angry at Joe. 3.2 Where was he?
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.927109333333333">
Sentence (3.2) is a represented thought. It mentions the object of a private state p whose
experiencer, Zoe, and attitude, wonder or a similar attitude, are implicit:
&amp;quot;Where was he?&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.250549">

<bodyText confidence="0.951497216216216">
Sentence (3.1) mentions the experiencer, attitude, and object of a private state /71:
&amp;quot; Zoe was angry at Joe.&amp;quot;
PS (pi, experiencery attitudei, objecti)
Under a private-state report interpretation of (3.1), p1 is not itself the object of some
other private state.
We shall call the character whose psychological point of view is taken by a sub-
jective sentence the subjective character (SC) of that sentence. The SC is the subject
of a narrative parenthetical, when one is present; the implicit experiencer, when the
sentence is a represented thought or represented perception without a narrative par-
enthetical; and the explicit experiencer, when the sentence is a private-state report.
In addition to private-state terms such as &apos;know&apos; and &apos;see,&apos; subjective sentences can
contain subjective elements, linguistic elements that express attitudes of the SC (this
aspect of subjective sentences is noted in many studies of POV; the term &amp;quot;subjective
element&amp;quot; is attributable to Banfield 1982). An example appears in the following passage
(throughout this paper, sentences in cited passages are indented to reflect paragraphing
in the original texts).
41&amp;quot;What are you doing in here?&amp;quot; 42Sudden1y she [Zoe] was furious
with him floe].
43&amp;quot;Spying, of course.&amp;quot;
4 4&amp;quot;Well of all dumb things! 4-51 thought you ran away.&amp;quot; 46joe
Bunch was awful. [Oneal, War Work, p. 130]
The adjective &amp;quot;awful&amp;quot; in (4.6) is a subjective element, expressing Zoe&apos;s evaluation of Joe
(that he is awful). Notice that (4.6) is a represented thought—Zoe thought is implicit—
and (4.2) is a private-state report, reporting Zoe&apos;s private state of being furious with
Joe.
As will be specified shortly in Section 6, the output of the algorithm is the POV
of a sentence, not a representation of its meaning. One interesting issue not addressed
in this paper is how one might represent the difference between, for example, &amp;quot;John
wondered where he was&amp;quot; and&amp;quot; &apos;Where was he?&apos; John wondered.&amp;quot;
But one distinction that is crucial for tracking POV is the distinction between the
interpretation of a sentence as either objective or subjective, and the kinds of states of
affairs that the sentence is about. The former is a pragmatic issue, concerning the use
of a sentence to present objective or subjective information about the fictional world
(Kuroda 1976). The latter is a semantic issue, concerning the word senses of lexical
items in the sentence. For instance, (5) below can be used to objectively narrate a past
action or to portray a character&apos;s thought of one. Tn either case, the sentence is about
an action.

(5) Gus had taken them back to town.
Now consider (6):

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9861365">
Whether the word sense of &apos;had&apos; in (6) is a state or an action (eating) is a separate
question from whether the sentence is objective or subjective (similarly, Hirst [1987]

suggests that lexical ambiguity is orthogonal to speech act ambiguity in conversation).
As specified in Section 6.1, the type of state of affairs that each clause is about is part
of the input to the algorithm.
In addition to being objective or a character&apos;s subjective sentence, a sentence may
express the attitudes of an overt narrator (Chatman 1978). But this paper will focus
only on texts without overt narrators. In addition, we will not consider passages with
irony and humor that do not originate with a character, or passages that are written
in the style of an epic, parable, or folktale. As well, we will not try to account for
fiction that is experimental in its manipulation of POV. Finally, we will only consider
narrative sentences in which the tenses are &amp;quot;shifted&amp;quot; (Jespersen 1924); that is, in which
the simple past is used for the narrative present, and the past perfective is used for
the narrative past. Note that it is not difficult to find published third-person texts that
satisfy these criteria.

3. Importance of Tracking Point of View
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999512857142857">
The importance to narrative understanding of recognizing characters&apos; intentions has
long been recognized in Al (see, for example, Wilensky [19831 and Dyer [1983]). To
perform plan recognition, the reader must, among other things, realize when charac-
ter&apos;s intentions are being communicated; this may involve realizing that a particular
sentence is subjective rather than objective. In (7), a represented thought communicates
a character&apos;s intentions:
7 &apos;He [Jeff] could see her walking the other way. 721f he wanted to
avoid notice, he would have to act with the same deliberate manner as
all the robots around him. 73He lengthened his stride and gave chase
without otherwise altering his body language. [Wu, Cyborg, p. 711
Sentence (7.2) is not a purely narrative sentence informing the reader that if Jeff wants
to avoid notice, he must change the way he is walking. Rather, (7.2) is Jeff&apos;s thought
expressing his goal to avoid notice, and also his belief about how to achieve it. Un-
derstanding this is necessary for the reader to perceive the intentionality behind the
action described in (7.3).
In addition to being important for plan recognition, tracking POV is necessary to
distinguish what is true in the fictional world from what is believed by the characters.
While objective sentences are unquestionably true in the fictional world, subjective
sentences reflect the subjective character&apos;s beliefs, which may be false in the fictional
world (Uspensky 1973; Kuroda 1976; Cohn 1978; Banfield 1982). A striking example
is the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.635812">
(8) This was David&apos;s boy. [Bridgers, All Together Now, p. 911
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995968875">
Sentence (8) is actually about a female character named &amp;quot;Casey.&amp;quot; However, it is the
represented thought of a character who believes that Casey is a boy, and reflects this
false belief about her.
Beliefs and intentions are just two of many types of attitudes communicated by
subjective sentences (see Dyer [1983] for a processing model of how various attitudes
can be related to goals). The algorithm for tracking POV presented in this paper is
intended to be just one part of an overall narrative-understanding system. Identifying
which attitudes are being presented and incorporating them into a representation of

</page>

<bodyText confidence="0.999758965517242">
the meaning of the text is beyond the scope of this work. But to accomplish such tasks,
the system must recognize when attitudes are being presented in the first place and
identify the character whose attitudes they are; these are the tasks involved in tracking
the psychological POV.
POV also has important implications for discourse processing. Discussion of this
topic is deferred until Section 14.
Sentences that present&apos; the attitudes of someone who is not the writer appear in
genres other than third-person fictional narrative text, such as newspaper articles and
textbooks (Banfield 1982), even if we might prefer another term than &amp;quot;represented
thought&amp;quot; for such sentences. Thus, the problem of tracking POV arises for these other
genres as well. Following is a passage from The New York Times (1990) that contains a
&amp;quot;represented thought&amp;quot;:
Looking at the more severely affected countries, experts are wondering
where the saturation point will be. Where will the infection rate level
off as most of those engaging in riskier behavior fall prey: 30 percent?
40 percent?
The second sentence presents something that the experts are wondering; 30 and 40
percent are the experts&apos; guesses, not those of the writer.
Third-person fictional narrative text is the focus of this work primarily because it
contains so many prototypical instances of sentences that present attitudes of someone
who is not the writer. Further, by restricting the types of texts considered (see Sec-
tion 2.2 above), it is possible to constrain the problem to choosing among an objective
POV and the points of view of the characters. In genres such as soft news and editori-
als, for example, the writer may present his or her own attitudes; when attitudes of the
writer, the speaker, or a narrator may be presented, the problem is less constrained.
Hamburger (1973), Kuroda (1973), Banfield (1982), Galbraith (1990), and Wiebe (1991)
address this issue more fully. Finally, there is a great deal of previous work to build
upon, in linguistics and especially literary theory investigating POV in novels and
short stories.
</bodyText>

4. Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998743">
Reasoning about whether a sentence is objective or the subjective sentence of this or
that character is certainly part of tracking POV (Fillmore 1974). But it is reasonable to
hypothesize that, in the face of all of the inferential possibilities, discourse expectations
too are involved in tracking POV; that is, in the absence of an explicit indication of
POV, readers are intended to assume that POV is being manipulated in one of the
usual ways, and to try to interpret the sentence accordingly. (Similar suggestions have
been made by Carberry [19891 with respect to resolving intersentential ellipsis and by
Sidner [1983] with respect to pronoun resolution.) We can view the text as composed
of maximal blocks of objective sentences (objective contexts) and maximal blocks of
subjective sentences that have the same subjective character (subjective contexts). Fur-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9769792">
1 My wording in this paper often attributes agency to sentences. I might say, for example, that a sentence
states something, communicates something, initiates a new POV, or refers to someone. Sidner (1983)
and Webber (1983) object specifically to using a noun phrase as the agent of the verb &apos;refer,&apos; since it is
the writer who is doing the referring, not the noun phrase. 1 do not disagree—my wording is for
convenience only.

ther, we can view the process of tracking POV as recognizing the following discourse
operations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98413">
1. Sentence s continues the current POV: s and the previous sentence are
either both objective or both subjective sentences of the same character.
2. Sentence s resumes y&apos;s POV: s is a subjective sentence of y and is
preceded by an objective context, which is in turn preceded by a
subjective context of the same character y.
3. Sentence s initiates y&apos;s POV: s is a subjective sentence of y and either s is
the first subjective sentence of a scene, or the SC of the previous
subjective sentence is a different character z.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999766173913043">
The approach taken in this work is to seek, by extensive examination of naturally oc-
curring narratives, regularities in the ways that authors initiate, resume, and continue
a character&apos;s point of view, and to develop an algorithm that tracks point of view
on the basis of the regularities found. Given certain combinations of sentence features
(e.g., tense, aspect, lexical items that potentially express subjectivity, the types of states
of affairs that the sentence is about, and the identities of the actors or experiencers of
those states of affairs), and of the current context (e.g., whether the previous sentence
was subjective or objective, whether a paragraph break separates the current and pre-
vious sentences, and the identity of the SC of the previous subjective sentence, if there
was one), particular point-of-view operations can be expected. A simple example: a
sentence that (1) is about an action, (2) is in the past progressive, and (3) follows,
without a paragraph break, the subjective sentence of a character c, usually continues
c&apos;s POV.
The examination of texts mentioned above was not a formal empirical investi-
gation, so the algorithm should be viewed as a hypothesis that can be subjected to
such tests. However, I examined passages from over forty novels and short stories
to identify the regularities upon which the algorithm is based, and strictly adhered
to the practice of considering only naturally occurring examples in developing the
algorithm. Further, some preliminary empirical tests of the algorithm have been per-
formed (see Section 12), among them psychological experiments of specific aspects of
the algorithm. The results of these experiments are positive. I describe them as &amp;quot;pre-
liminary&amp;quot; so as not to suggest that the entire algorithm has already been subjected to
psychological experimentation.

5. Previous Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999856583333333">
There are literary theorists and linguists who investigate linguistic aspects of sub-
jective sentences. The present work greatly benefited from their investigations, most
directly from Dole2e1 (1973), Uspensky (1973), Kuroda (1973, 1976), Fillmore (1974),
Cohn (1978), and especially Banfield (1982). However, the relevant work in the above
fields is descriptive only; it describes characteristics of subjective sentences, but does
not address the problem of tracking POV. An exception is work on POV and aspect
that shows that aspect is only a context-sensitive marker of subjectivity (Ehrlich [1987,
19901 and Caenepeel [1989j; see Section 9).
In AT, Nakhimovsky (1988) suggests a discourse-processing approach to tracking
POV, but does not develop it in any depth. Also, Reiser (1981) simply suggests that
POV may be established by syntactic clues, and by including &amp;quot;more episodes and
internal information&amp;quot; about a character (p. 209).

A great deal of work in Al has involved inferring speaker and hearer attitudes in
conversation (such as work in plan recognition in conversation—see, e.g., Allen and
Perrault [1980]; in user modeling—see, e.g., the papers in the special issue of Computa-
tional Linguistics on user modeling 1988; and in dynamically constructing nested-belief
environments during understanding—see, e.g., Wilks and Bien [1983]) and character&apos;s
attitudes in stories (see, e.g., Wilensky [1983] and Dyer [1983]). Such beliefs might be
about what agents who are mentioned in the discourse believe, but the question is not
addressed as to whether an utterance itself presents what is actually the object of an
agent&apos;s attitude, where that agent is not mentioned in the sentence.
In summary, there is no previous detailed investigation of the problem of tracking
the psychological POV.

• Function FEATURES maps a sentence (see Section 6.3.2) into a set of features:
FEATURES : Sentence FeatureSet.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.956964882352941">
A FeatureSet consists of the following (some of the features will be expanded upon in
later sections, as indicated; for extensive detail, see Wiebe [19901):
1. The potential subjective elements in the sentence, if any. The potential
subjective elements form a large class that includes lexical items used
with particular meanings, tense, aspect, and certain syntactic properties
(see Section 9.2).
2. The type of state of affairs that each clause is about. For example, the
main clause of the following is about a private state and the
subordinated clause is about an action:
John wondered whether Mary opened the door.
Note that each of the following is about a private state:
Mary was afraid of the dark.
The darkness made Mary afraid.
Wiebe (1990) gives a list of private-state terms, noting which syntactic
roles the experiencer fills in various clause structures (this material is
drawn from Quirk et al. [19851). Section 6.3.1 gives the categorization of
states of affairs used in this work.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.87082875">
3. An indication of whether or not the head noun of the subject of the main
clause is a private-state noun (e.g., &apos;pain&apos; and &apos;astonishment&apos;) and, if it is,
the state of affairs that that noun is about. Examples of sentences with
such private-state nouns are:
(10) The feeling went away.
(11) The pain increased.
(12) His astonishment grew.
4. The experiencers and actors (i.e., particular case fillers [Fillmore 1968]) of

<bodyText confidence="0.9828154">
the states of affairs of items (2) and (3). Because a single action might
have more than one actor, and a single state might have more than one
experiencer, each of these is a set. If an experiencer or actor is not
mentioned in the sentence (as is the case for the subject nouns in (10)
and (11)), then that experiencer or actor is the empty set.

Function FEATURES involves the resolution of syntactic, semantic, and discourse/prag-
matic ambiguities that are outside the scope of this work (see Section 14 for a dis-
cussion of interactions between point of view and discourse processing). While the
implemented system demonstrated in Appendix B takes actual sentences as input, it
does not truly implement FEATURES, but is successful in computing the FeatureSet of
a sentence only for sentences that fall within its limited coverage. There is another
version of the system that queries the user for the information returned by function
FEATURES, to enable the algorithm to be tested on unlimited text, without concern
for problems not addressed in this work. it is this system that is used in the test of
the algorithm presented in Appendix C and to support the psychological experiments
mentioned in Sections 8.3.1, 9.3, and 12.

A Context and an Interpretation are as follows. A Context consists of (1) the identity of
the SC of the last subjective sentence that appeared in the text, if there was one, (2) the
identity of the last active character (defined in Section 8.2.2), if there was one, (3) the
identities of any characters whose points of view were taken earlier in the text, and

6.3 States of Affairs, Sentences, and Contexts: Some Further Details
6.3.1 States of Affairs. The following are the range of state-of-affairs types that can be
included in a FeatureSet. For more refined categorizations for the purpose of analyzing
tense and aspect, see, for example, Reichenbach (1947) and the papers in the special
issue of Computational Linguistics on tense and aspect in 1988.
1. private-state actions, such as looking and sighing (see Section 11);
2. other kinds of actions;
3. private states; and
4. nonprivate states, such as being six feet tall.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965818181818">
The rough part of this categorization is the boundary between the second and fourth
items. We shall assume that function FEATURES classifies only clear instances of nonpri-
vate states as such, and that states of affairs that fall between the categories of action
and nonprivate state, such as processes, are classified as actions.
In quoted speech, there are states of affairs on two levels: those spoken of and
the action of speaking itself. The regularities on which the algorithm is based involve
the latter. Thus, the contents of the quoted string are not considered, and, even if a
discourse parenthetical does not actually appear, the sentence is viewed as one whose
main clause is about a communicative action (a subtype of (2) above); that is, as one
whose main verb phrase contains a communicative verb with a quoted string as object.
We return to this point in Section 95.

6.3.2 Sentences. We shall call any InputItem that is not a scene or paragraph break a
&amp;quot;sentence,&amp;quot; although such an InputItem is sometimes smaller than an actual sentence,
sometimes larger. The former occurs for compound sentences and the latter occurs for
sentences of quoted speech.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.989968947368421">
Suppose that a compound sentence with conjuncts ci, c„ starts at position i in
text t. Then, ITEm(t,i) = cl, ITEm(t,i+n-l) = cn. We shall call each c, a &amp;quot;sentence.&amp;quot;
In the case of quoted speech, everything enclosed within a single pair of quotes,
together with the accompanying discourse parenthetical, if there is one, counts as a
single InputItem that we shall call a &amp;quot;sentence.&amp;quot; For example, (4.4) and (4.5) together
compose a single Input Item (a single &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot;). Since the algorithm does not consider
the contents of quoted strings (see Section 6.3.1), there is no reason for each constituent
sentence of a quoted string to be a separate InputItem.
From this point forward, numbering within cited passages is as follows: each
InputItem that is not a paragraph or scene break is given a separate number.
Now that the units of input have been specified, the following can be noted. In
this work, if any part of a sentential InputItem s is subjective, then s as a whole is
considered to be subjective. This makes the algorithm easier to understand. Enabling
it to report which part of s is subjective, if relevant, would involve straightforward
refinements of the text situations, of interpretations, and of some conditional steps of
the algorithm into subcases.
6.3.3 Choosing a State of Affairs. Out of the states of affairs included in a FeatureSet
for a sentential input item s, the algorithm chooses just one to consider. Specifically,
the algorithm for POV uses the following function:

<equation confidence="0.65474">
CHOSEN-STATE-OF-AFFAIRS : FeatureSet State0fAffairs.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994268933333333">
As we shall see in Section 8, private states are particularly important to consider, be-
cause if a sentence that is about a private state is interpreted to be a private-state
report, then the SC of the sentence is the experiencer of the private state. A subordi-
nated clause can report a character&apos;s private state; an example is &amp;quot;thinking ...&amp;quot; in the
following sentence (as it appears in the novel):
When he [Call] got within fifteen miles of Lonesome Dove he cut west,
thinking they would be holding the herd in that direction. [McMurtry,
Lonesome Dove, p. 181]
Following is the specification of CHOSEN-STATE-OF-AFFAIRS. Let Cram be the main
clause of s; let ci, , ,be the other n clauses of s; and let hn be the head noun
of the subject of c,,,nn. Further, let soa,„in be the state of affairs that c„,„,„ is about; let
soahn be the state of affairs that hn is about (but if hn is not about a state of affairs—for
example, if it is a proper noun—then let soah,, be nil); and let soai (1 &lt; i &lt; n) be the state
of affairs that ci is about. Then, the result of CHOSEN-STATE-OF-AFFAIRs(FEATuREs(s)) is

Table 1 gives some examples.
Note that private-state terms appearing in certain types of constituents cannot be
used to report private states. An example is a manner adverbial (Quirk et al. 1985),
such as the italicized portion of &amp;quot;Japheth turned the book over in a puzzled manner.&amp;quot;
(There are others addressed in Wiebe [1990], but because of space limitations, we shall
ignore them in this paper.) The phrase &amp;quot;in a puzzled manner&amp;quot; does not report a private
state, but rather describes the manner in which something is done. The state of affairs
chosen for this sentence is simply the main-clause action.
To facilitate discussion, a sentential InputItem of which the state of affairs chosen
for consideration is of type X will be called an &amp;quot;X sentence,&amp;quot; for example, &amp;quot;action
sentence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;private-state sentence.&amp;quot;
6.3.4 The Text Situations. Following are the text situations (recall that a text situa-
tion is part of the context, defined in Section 6.2).2 To make it easier to understand
them, definitions are given in both English and diagrams. Each diagram shows what
appears between the start of the current scene, represented by &amp;quot;start-of-scene,&amp;quot; and
the current position, represented by a diamond (o). The start of the current scene is
either a scene break or the very beginning of the text. The symbol &amp;quot;11&amp;quot; represents
a paragraph break; &amp;quot;objective-sentence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;subjective-sentence&amp;quot; represent objective
and subjective sentences, respectively; &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; alone represents either a subjective
or objective sentence; the symbol &amp;quot;*&amp;quot; means 0 or more occurrences, &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; means 1 or
more occurrences, and &amp;quot;...&amp;quot; represents any number of paragraph breaks and sentences
(but not scene breaks, since only what has appeared since the start of the current scene
is shown). A scene is assumed to always begin with a paragraph break.

Active characters are discussed in the section about identifying the SC (Section 8),
because the raison d&apos;etre of the active-character component of an interpretation is that
the active character of an objective sentence may become the Las tActiveCharacter of a
later context, context, and as such, may become the SC of a subjective sentence that is
processed in context,.
8. Identifying the Subjective Character
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995006">
8.1 Introduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94812447826087">
The SC of a subjective sentence can always be identified from the sentence itself if
the sentence has a narrative parenthetical, such as &apos;Dennys thought&apos; in (2), and can
sometimes be so identified if the sentence is about a private state. When the SC is not
identifiable from the sentence, she is often a previously mentioned character. Thus, as
the text is processed, any algorithm for tracking POV must keep track of characters
who are likely to become the SC of a later subjective sentence. I call such characters
expected subjective characters. The algorithm presented in this paper considers two
possibilities: the last subjective character and the last active character of the current
context. Each is an expected subjective character only in certain text situations. The
idea of keeping track of entities evoked in the text in order to interpret later sentences
is attributable to work on anaphora resolution (e.g., Sidner [1983] and Grosz, Joshi,
and Weinstein [19831). Active characters are based specifically on Sidner&apos;s actor focus,
but while Sidner&apos;s actor focus is &amp;quot;whoever is currently the agent in the sentence&amp;quot;
(p. 282), many sentences with agents do not have active characters, as we shall see in
Section 8.2.2.
In some cases, the SC of a subjective sentence is not identifiable when the sentence
appears, but may be identifiable after later sentences are processed. The algorithm,
as presented in Wiebe (1990), handles one such case. Because of space limitations,
however, this aspect of the algorithm is not presented in this paper, but is only briefly
described (in Section 8.2.4).
Here is a high-level algorithm for identifying the SC (comments are preceded by

The following subsections refine and illustrate the above algorithm. We first consider
identifying the SC based on expected subjective characters (in Section 8.2), and then
identifying the SC from the sentence (in Section 8.3).

8.2 Identifying the SC from the Context

<bodyText confidence="0.991721333333333">
In this section, we consider cases in which the SC of a subjective sentence cannot
be identified from the sentence itself. We first consider the last subjective character
(Section 8.2.1), then the last active character (Section 8.2.2), and then the cases in
which both (Section 8.2.3) or neither (Section 8.2.4) are expected subjective characters.
8.2.1 The Last Subjective Character. An SC who is not identifiable from the sentence
itself is most often the last subjective character. In this case, the current sentence is
continuing a character&apos;s POV, if the previous sentence was also subjective, or resuming
one, if objective sentences have appeared since the last subjective sentence. Sentence
(1.2) above illustrates the former, and passage (15) illustrates the latter:

154.I do too!&amp;quot; cried Rosie.

Sentences (15.1), (15.2), and (15.11) are Zoe&apos;s subjective sentences. Sentence (15.11)
expresses Zoe&apos;s judgment that there is no use in arguing, resuming Zoe&apos;s point of
view: it has the same SC as the last subjective sentence, (15.2), and is separated from
(15.2) by objective sentences (15.3)—(15.10).
If there has not been a subjective sentence so far in the text, then the last subjective
character, which is the empty set in this case, clearly should not be an expected subjec-
tive character. Moreover, drastic spatial and temporal discontinuities can block the con-
tinuation or resumption of a character&apos;s psychological POV. This paper considers one
such kind of discontinuity, a scene break. The condition under which the last subjective
character of context is an expected subjective character is when a subjective sentence
has appeared in the current scene. That is, LAsT-SC-Is-AN-ExPEcTED-SC (contexti) is true
if TEXT-SiruKrioN-Or(contexti) {presubjective-nonactive, presubjective-active}.
A scene break is a break from one parallel story-line to another. Almeida (1987)
analyzes parallel story-lines as forming separate narrative-lines, which are stretches
of narrative that are controlled by single now-points. The following passage illustrates

As passage (16) appears in the novel, the SC of all of the subjective sentences before
the chapter break is the character Slick, and a scene break occurs at the chapter break.
While the sentence following the break is subjective, the SC of that sentence should
not be identified to be the last subjective character, Slick.
8.2.2 The Last Active Character. A SC who is not identifiable from the sentence itself
may also be the actor of an action that a previous objective sentence is about (but less
commonly than the last subjective character). Since this character need not be the SC
of the last subjective sentence, this is a way for the author to initiate a new point of
view. Following is an example (by this point in the novel, both Jake and Augustus
have been the SC of previous subjective sentences):
17&apos;1 Jake felt sour. 17.2He wished again that circumstances hadn&apos;t
prompted him to come back. 17-3He had already spent one full night
on horseback, 17.4and now the boys were expecting him to spend an-
other, all on account of a bunch of livestock he had no interest in in
the first place.
17.5&amp;quot;I don&apos;t know as I&apos;m coming,&amp;quot; he said. 176j just got here. If
I&apos;d known you boys did nothing but chase horses around all night, I
don&apos;t know that I would have come.&amp;quot;
177&amp;quot;Why, Jake, you lazy bean,&amp;quot; Augustus said, 175and walked off.
179Jake had a stubborn streak in him, 17.10and once it was activated
even Call could seldom do much with him. [McMurtry, Lonesome Dove,
p. 162]
As this passage appears in the novel, (17.1)—(17.4) are the subjective sentences of Jake,
and (17.9)—(17.10) are the subjective sentences of Augustus, the actor of an action that
a previous objective sentence was about (sentence (17.8)). However, it is Jake who is
the last subjective character, so Augustus&apos;s point of view is being initiated, not merely
resumed or continued.

subjective character) is one in which the actor was the SC of some previous subjective

sentence in the text, and the sentence about his or her action is focused by the text. The
precise situation is captured by the following specifications of what an active character
is, what the last active character is, and of the text situations in which the last active
character is expected.
Suppose that or is an objective sentence that is InputHemp Saying that os has an
active character means that POV(FEATuREs(os), context)) = (objective, ac), where ac is
not the empty set. This is the case iff:

<equation confidence="0.63898">
i. os is about an action that is actually performed in the current scene by ac
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999650958333333">
(more precisely, when the state of affairs chosen for consideration is such
an action), and
ac C PREVIOUS-SCS--OF (context)). That is, ac is in the set of characters who
have been the SC of some previous subjective sentence in the text
(possibly before the current scene).
The algorithm for POV determines whether an action meets the conditions in (i) by
looking at such things as the tense, aspect, and mood of os (the features the algorithm
considers are in FEATuRES(os)). First, to guarantee that the action is not performed
earlier or later than the current moment in the story, the main verb phrase of as must
be in the simple past. Also, to be about a specific action, or cannot be habitual. So,
the main verb phrase cannot be accompanied by an adverbial such as at times, usually,
rarely, or on weekends.&apos; Finally, to be about an action that actually occurs, the main
clause of the sentence must not contain modal auxiliary verbs such as could, going to,
had better, have to, might, should, or must, modal adverbs such as likely, maybe, perhaps,
or possibly, and it must not be negated. If the action is quoted speech, then these
restrictions apply to the discourse parenthetical.
Now we turn to the last active character. In contexti, LAST-ACIIVE-CHARACTER-
OF(COnteXti) is the empty set if no sentences with active characters have appeared;
otherwise, it is the active character of the last sentence that had one.
The last active character is an expected subjective character only when a subjec-
tive sentence has not appeared earlier in the current paragraph, and there is an earlier
sentence in the current paragraph that has an active character. That is, LAST-ACTIVE-

character and the last subjective character are both expected subjective characters
(which, as the reader may have noticed, is when the current text situation is post-

he or she is more highly focused by the text. In fact, there is only one case in which

The criterion for choosing the last subjective character is correct for the situation in
which the last subjective character&apos;s attention is directed toward the last active char-
acter, and the sentence represents the last subjective character&apos;s reflection about or
observation of the other. It is incorrect, however, if the sentence is the last active char-
acter&apos;s self-reflection or self-perception; this heuristic relies on the relative infrequency
of subjective sentences about oneself.
Consider subjective sentence (15.11). When this sentence is encountered, only the
last subjective character (Zoe) is expected, because the sentence is at the beginning of
a new paragraph. The algorithm correctly identifies her to be the subjective character.
Now consider (17.9), which is also subjective. When it is encountered, not only is the
last subjective character expected (Jake), but so is the last active character (Augustus):
Augustus is the active character of (17.7)—(17.8), because he has been the SC of previous
subjective sentences and (17.7)—(17.8) are objective sentences about his current actions;
and, when (17.9) is encountered, the last active character is expected, since (17.8) (but
no subjective sentences) appeared earlier in the current paragraph. The algorithm
correctly identifies the SC to be Augustus (the last active character), rather than Jake
(the last subjective character), because the criterion for choosing the last subjective
character is not satisfied: the sentence is not about the last active character. Competition
also arises in the following passage, but this time it is the last subjective character
who should be chosen. When the passage is encountered, Lorena is the last subjective
character:

he might cry too. 18-3You&apos;l1 just have to cry, she [Lorena] thought.
[McMurtry, Lonesome Dove, p. 218]
By this point in the novel, Lippy has been a subjective character. Thus, since (18.1) is
about his current action, he is the active character of (18.1). After (18.1), Lippy, as the
last active character, is expected, because (18.1) is an objective sentence that begins
a new paragraph. Sentence (18.2) is subjective because the evidential &apos;looked like&apos;
appears. Competition is (correctly) resolved in favor of the last subjective character
(Lorena), because the sentence is about the last active character (Lippy).

then the algorithm fails to identify the SC at this point in the text. This eventuality is
rare, relative to others: it can arise only upon the first subjective sentence of a scene
(otherwise, the last subjective character would be expected) and only in the absence of
one of the things that are usually used to initiate a character&apos;s point of view (such as

a narrative parenthetical or private-state report, discussed in Section 8.3). An example
of this is (16.6), and another is (19.1), which is the beginning of a novel:
19-1Captain Scalawag&apos;s treasure! 19-211 was the first thing Pete
thought of when he woke up. [Lorimer, The Mystery of the Missing
Treasure, p. 1]
In a case such as (19.1), it is not possible to identify the SC without reading further in
the text. In a case such as (16.6), however, it might be possible to do so. That is, a reader
might be able to infer who the SC is from clues in the sentence, such as indications
of place, or facts that only a certain character knows. This process is not addressed in
this work. However, the author could have made identifying the SC easier by using,
for example, a narrative parenthetical or private-state report (see Section 8.3); by not
including one of these, the author is deliberately demanding some extra work from
the reader.
The algorithm as presented in Wiebe (1990) can identify the SC after later sentences
are processed in the case where a later sentence contains a narrative parenthetical or is
a private-state report. As illustrations, (16.7) is a private-state report whose SC, Mona,
is the SC of (16.6), and (19.2) is a private-state report whose SC, Pete, is the SC of
(19.1).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979902">
8.3 Identifying the SC from the Sentence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9529404">
We now turn to cases in which the SC is identifiable from the sentence itself (that
is, cases in which IDENTIFY-SC-FROM-THE-SENTENcE(featureSet„ context) 0 {}; see Sec-
tion 8.1). In these cases, the SC of sentence s is chosen from among certain characters
in FEATURES(s). Such a character need not be the last subjective character; when she is
not, s initiates her POV. Thus, the cases discussed in this section—i.e., uses of sentences
with certain features in particular contexts—are ways to initiate a character&apos;s POV.
The straightforward case is when s contains a narrative parenthetical, such as
sentence (2). The SC is always the subject of the parenthetical.
The less straightforward case is when s is a private-state sentence. Doleel (1973),
Cohn (1978), and Banfield (1982) all note that a private-state sentence is a way to
initiate a character&apos;s POV. In the framework presented in this paper, the SC may be
the experiencer of the private state, even if she is not the last subjective character. An
example occurs in (20):
(20) 20.1.,Drown me-&amp;quot; Augustus said. 20-2&amp;quot;Why if anybody had tried it,
those girls would have clawed them to shreds.&amp;quot; 203He knew Call was
mad, 204but wasn&apos;t much inclined to humor him. 205I1 was his dinner
table as much as Call&apos;s, 20&apos;6and if Call didn&apos;t like the conversation he
could go to bed.
20.7Call knew there was no point in arguing. &amp;quot;That was what Au-
gustus wanted: argument. 20&apos;9He didn&apos;t really care what the question
was, 20.10and it made no great difference to him which side he was
on. 20.11He just plain loved to argue. [McMurtry, Lonesome Dove, p. 16]
Sentences (20.3)-(20.6) are Augustus&apos;s subjective sentences and (20.7)-(20.11) are Call&apos;s.
Thus, (20.7) initiates a new POV. It is a private-state sentence and the SC, Call, is the
experiencer of the private state. But passage (20) also shows that the SC of a private-

state sentence need not be the experiencer. In (20.6), for example, &amp;quot;Call didn&apos;t like the
conversation&amp;quot; is about a private state (Call not liking the conversation), but the SC
of the sentence is Augustus, not Call. Trt the following subsections, we will consider
factors that can indicate that it is not the experiencer who is the SC of a private-state
sentence.
8.3.1 Textual Continuity. POV does not typically shift from one character to another
without a paragraph break. Thus, the absence of a paragraph break suggests that a
shift has not occurred. Consider the following schema, in which a subjective sentence
S, whose SC is X, is followed, without a paragraph break, by a private-state sentence
P whose experiencer is a different character Y:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.898428">
sentence&apos; subjective-sentence-S private-state-sentence-P
Sc = X experiencer Y
Character Y is the experiencer of the private state that P is about. If Y were also the SC
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.852784434782609">
of P, then a shift would have occurred, from X&apos;s POV to Y&apos;s POV, without a paragraph
break. The fact that no paragraph break appears—that is, that P is in the continuing-
subjective situation—suggests that P continues X&apos;s POV rather than initiating Y&apos;s.
When a private-state sentence appears in the continuing-subjective situation, therefore,
the algorithm identifies the SC to be the last SC rather than the experiencer of the
private state.
The question of whether there is a psychological link between paragraph breaks
and tracking POV has not been previously investigated. Stark (1987, 1988) performed
psychological experiments that showed that there is a significant correlation between
paragraph breaks and discourse discontinuities, but the sorts of discontinuities she
investigated did not include changes in POV. Nakhimovsky and Rapaport (1988) sug-
gest that in narrative, paragraph breaks accompany changes in POV, but they did
not investigate this hypothesis experimentally. In fact, we have performed psycholog-
ical experiments (Bruder and Wiebe 1990 and in press) that did establish such a link.
Specifically, through manipulation of paragraph breaks in naturally occurring pas-
sages, the experiments showed that readers&apos; interpretations of private-state sentences
are influenced by paragraph breaks as we predicted on the basis of the algorithm.
8.3.2 Subjective Elements. Private-state sentences are pragmatically ambiguous as to
whether they are private-state reports or represented thoughts.&apos; Consider sentence
(21):
(21) John knew Mary had the key.
Sentence (21) is about a private state:
&amp;quot;John knew Mary had the key.&amp;quot;

<footnote confidence="0.683487166666667">
p5 (pi. experienceri, attitudei, objecti)
4 A private-state sentence may also be objective. An example is a simple-past sentence with a negated
factive term and a propositional object, such as &amp;quot;John did not know that Mary was in the next room.&amp;quot;
This sentence cannot be John&apos;s subjective sentence; it is either objective or the subjective sentence of
someone else. Because of space limitations, how the algorithm recognizes and processes such sentences
is not discussed in this paper; see Wiebe and Rapaport (1985) and Wiebe (1990).

Under a private-state report interpretation of (21), pi is not itself the object of some
other private state. But under a represented thought interpretation of (21), pi is the
object of some other private state p2, the experiencer and attitude of which are implicit:
</bodyText>

&amp;quot;John knew Mary had the key.&amp;quot;
ps(p2,experiencer2, attitude2, object2 = pi)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990064">
To my knowledge, this ambiguity in the interpretation of private-state sentences and
its importance in tracking POV have not been previously discussed in linguistics or
literary theory. For example, Cohn (1978) says that represented thoughts can be dis-
tinguished from private-state reports by &amp;quot;the absence of mental verbs&amp;quot; in the former
(p. 104).
The SC of a private-state report is always the experiencer of the private state. So,
if some oracle were to inform you that (21) is a private-state report, you would then
know that the SC is the experiencer of the private state (John). On the other hand, if
the oracle were to inform you that (21) is a represented thought, you could not then
identify the SC just by looking at the sentence alone. In fact, it is true of any represented
thought without a narrative parenthetical, private-state sentence or otherwise, that you
cannot identify the SC from the sentence itself. This is so regardless of whether or not
the SC happens to be referred to in the sentence. Consider the following two sentences,
which are represented thoughts from different pages of a short story (&amp;quot;The Garden
Party&amp;quot; by Katharine Mansfield):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9915705">
(22) Why couldn&apos;t she?
(23) What nice eyes he had, small, but such a dark blue!
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999074428571429">
As these sentences appear in the story, the SC of (22) happens to be the referent of
&amp;quot;she&amp;quot; (corresponding to the conversational utterance, &amp;quot;Why can&apos;t I?&amp;quot;), but the SC of
(23) is not mentioned in the sentence at all. Even though you know that (22) and (23)
are represented thoughts, you need to consider the context to identify their SCs. Thus,
if a private-state sentence s contains some indication that s is a represented thought,
then the SC cannot be identified from s itself, and, as discussed in Section 8.2, the
expected subjective characters should be considered.
Subjective elements indicate that a sentence is a represented thought (this state-
ment is qualified later in this section and in Section 10). Subjective elements are lin-
guistic elements that express emotions, uncertainty, evaluations, and other kinds of
subjectivity (Banfield 1982) (they are discussed in detail in Section 9). Examples are
evaluative terms such as &apos;the old bag&apos; (Bonfield 1982) and evidentials such as &apos;evi-
dently&apos; and &apos;apparently&apos; (Dole2rel 1973).
In the following passage, a subjective element indicates that the SC of a private-
state sentence is not the experiencer of the private state. At the start of the passage,
Sandy and Dennys are (collectively) the last subjective character:
24.1Japheth, evidently realizing that they were no longer behind
him, turned around 24.2and jogged back toward them, seemingly cool
and unwinded. fL&apos;Engle, Many Waters, p. 24]
The subjective element &apos;evidently&apos; in (24.1) indicates that the sentence is not a private-
state report. That is, (24.1) is not a report that Japheth realizes that they are no longer

<bodyText confidence="0.995761844444444">
behind him. Rather, Sandy and Dennys (the collective SC) ascribe this private state to
him.
However, subordinated subjective elements, those within the scope of the private-
state term, can appear in private-state reports. (This is one reason why I define private-
state reports to be subjective.) Thus, they cannot be used to distinguish private-state
reports from represented thoughts, and so cannot be used as evidence that the SC of
a private-state sentence is not the experiencer. For example:
25.11Jgh! she [the girl] thought. 25-2How could the poor thing have
married him in the first place?
25 3Johrtnie Martin could not believe that he was seeing that old
bag&apos;s black eyes sparkling with disgust and unsheathed contempt at
him. [Caldwell, No One Hears But Him, pp. 98-991
Sentence (25.3) is a private-state report and the experiencer is the SC (Johnnie Martin);
this is so even though (25.3) contains the subjective element &apos;old bag&apos; and even though
there is an expected subjective character (the girl) when it is encountered. Because &apos;old
bag&apos; appears within the scope of the private-state term &apos;believe,&apos; it is not considered
in identifying the SC. On the other hand, the subjective element &apos;evidently&apos; in (24.1)
is not in the scope of &apos;realizing&apos; (i.e., it is nonsubordinated); thus, it can be used as
evidence that the SC is not the experiencer of the private state.
If a private-state sentence does not have a nonsubordirtated subjective element and
does not appear in the continuing-subjective situation, then the algorithm identifies
the SC to be the experiencer.
8.3.3 Broadening and Narrowing of POV. Recall that an experiencer, actor, SC, or
expected subjective character may be more than one physical character (recall that
these entities are represented as sets). A broadening of point of view occurs when a
new subjective character is a superset of the old subjective character, and a narrowing
occurs when a new one is a subset of the old one. One situation in which such changes
occur is when the experiencer of a private-state report is such a subset or superset.
One addition to the algorithm as described so far is needed to allow for this situation:
for a private-state sentence in the continuing-subjective situation (without subjective
elements that can be considered), if the experiencer is a superset or subset of the last
subjective character, then it is the experiencer who the algorithm chooses to be the SC,
rather than the last subjective character. For example:
26.1In the clear late afternoon light they [Call and Augustus] could
see all the way back to Lonesome Dove and the river and Mexico.
26-2Aug-ustus regretted not tying a jug to his saddle-3 he would have
liked to sit on the little hill and drink for an hour. [McMurtry, Lonesome
Dove, p. 241]
As this passage appears in the novel, (26.1) is the subjective sentence of both Call and
Augustus, but (26.2) is the subjective sentence only of Augustus; thus, point of view
narrows upon (26.2). The above rule precludes the reading of a sentence such as (26.2)
as the represented thought of the last subjective character (i.e., Call and Augustus
in passage (26)). However, no examples of such a reading were found in the texts
examined; note that the rule applies only if there are no subjective elements that can
be considered in the sentence.

8.3.4 Unspecified Experiencers. Consider the following passage:
(27)

Sentence (27.2) is a private-state sentence; specifically, CHOSEN-STATE-OF-AFFAIRS(FEA-
TURES (27.2)) = ps, where ps is the private state that the private-state noun &amp;quot;anxiety&amp;quot;
is about (see Section 6.3.3). Both the experiencer of ps and the SC of (27.2) happen to
be the same character (Sandy). However, the SC of (27.2) cannot be identified from
the sentence itself, because the experiencer of ps is not mentioned in the sentence.
(I call such experiencers unspecified experiencers; note that EXPERIENCER-OR-ACTOR-
OF(ps,FEATuREs(27.2)) = f.) Thus, for a private-state sentence with an unspecified
experiencer, IDENTIFY-SC-FROM-THE-SENTENCE returns the empty set, and the algorithm
goes on to consider expected subjective characters. In (27), for example, the algorithm
correctly identifies the SC of (27.2) to be Sandy, the last subjective character.
8.3.5 Summary. Following is the algorithm for function IDENTIFY-SC-FROM-THE-SENT-
ENCE (introduced in Section 8.1). One of the arguments is a feature set, featureSet; we
will use s to refer to the sentence that featureSet is a feature set of (i.e., FEATURES(s) —

We now turn to deciding whether or not a sentence is subjective in the first place. Au-
thors could unambiguously mark each subjective sentence as subjective, by including
a narrative parenthetical in each, for example. But suppose that a sentence S that the
author intends to be subjective appears in the continuing-subjective situation:

A character&apos;s POV very often continues at least until the end of the paragraph. So, in

subjective sentences of X. Thus, the reader has a strong expectation that X&apos;s POV will
continue, so a weak hint that S is subjective is sufficient for the reader to recognize
that it is.
Now consider a text situation in which there has been a subjective sentence in the
scene, but objective sentences and paragraph breaks have appeared since then:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5672465">
(U) start-of-scene ... subjective-sentence (objective-sentence+ 411)± sentence-S
Sc X
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999234411764706">
in S&apos;s context in schema (ii), X is an expected subjective character. The reader expects
X&apos;s POV to be resumed, but not as strongly as the reader expects X&apos;s POV to be
continued in schema (i), since the local context of S in (ii) is not subjective as it is in
(i). An unambiguous indication that S is subjective is not necessary, but a stronger hint
should be included than is sufficient in (i).
The main sorts of &amp;quot;hints&amp;quot; of subjectivity that the algorithm considers are linguistic
elements that potentially express subjectivity (potential subjective elements). Some of
these are weaker hints than others, and many are usually subjective only in certain text
situations. The algorithm, which, recall, tracks point of view on the basis of regularities,
uses the text situation to decide whether an instance of one is indeed subjective.
&amp;quot;Subjective element&amp;quot; is the term I use for an instance of a potential subjective
element that actually is subjective in the context of use. This term is borrowed from
Banfield (1982), but redefined; Banfield uses it to refer only to linguistic elements that
are always subjective.
Section 9.2 identifies a number of potential subjective elements, and Section 93
specifies how the algorithm uses them and other information to recognize subjective
sentences.

Previous work in linguistics and literary theory noted the presence in subjective sen-
tences of many (but not all) of the potential subjective elements considered by the
algorithm. However, with the exception of two of the elements, the perfective and
progressive aspects (see below), previous work did not address the problem that many
of the elements are only potentially subjective, and can also appear in objective sen-
tences. Further, Wiebe (1990) contains an extensive, detailed catalogue of the potential
subjective elements (specified mainly in terms of syntactic and semantic categories
presented in Quirk et al. [1985]); such a catalog did not previously exist.
Most of the potential subjective elements are lexical. But it is not words and phrases
themselves that are potential subjective elements, but rather words and phrases used

meaning, as in &amp;quot;John was poor&amp;quot; (Banfield 1982; the evaluative meaning of &apos;poor&apos; is
one of the elements that Banfield argues is always subjective).
Tables 2 and 3 list some potential subjective elements, giving very brief character-
izations. For further details, see Wiebe (1990). All of the citations in Tables 2 and 3 are
with respect to the linguistic categories of the elements. Some of those who discuss
the appearance of the elements in subjective sentences are as follows: Banfield (1982)
discusses (1), (2.1)—(2.3), (4), (5), and (12); Dolael (1973) discusses (1), (2.1)—(2.3), (5),
(6.1), (6.2), and (8); Brinton (1980) discusses (9) (she shows that a simile can be a marker
of represented perception) and (12); Ehrlich (1990) discusses (11), and Ehrlich (1987)
discusses (12).
The past perfective is potentially subjective simply because a character can reflect
on what occurred (or might have occurred) in the past. However, as discussed by
Ehrlich (1990) and many others, the narrative past may be expressed by the simple-
past tense in the midst of a subjective context; detecting simple-past references to the
past is not addressed in this work.

Expectations for a subjective sentence are strongest in situation (1t,) and weakest in
situation (40, so the algorithm takes even the weakest potential subjective elements
to be subjective in (14,), but only the strongest ones to be subjective in (40. In general,
each potential subjective element pse is associated with a set of text situations t such
that the algorithm interprets pse to be subjective iff the current text situation is in t.
There is an it, (1 &lt; &lt; 4) such that t contains the situations in lt, through it but not
those in it, +1 through 4f,. We shall say that pse is associated at the highest level with
the situations in it,.
In addition to potential subjective elements, there is another source of information
the algorithm considers: the type of state of affairs the sentence is about. First, private-
state action sentences can be subjective; see Section 11. Second, private-state sentences
are usually subjective (we are not considering objective private-state sentences in this
paper; see Wiebe [1990] and footnote 4). Third, a nonprivate-state sentence in the
continuing-subjective situation usually continues the subjective context. For example:
28 &apos;Lorena didn&apos;t like it that Gus acted like Jake wasn&apos;t much. &apos;Fie
had a reputation for being a cool man in a fight. [McMurtry, Lonesome
Dove, p. 1901
Sentence (28.1) is Lorena&apos;s subjective sentence, and (28.2), a nonprivate-state sentence,
continues her subjective context. In the continuing-subjective situation, therefore, the
algorithm interprets a nonprivate-state sentence to be subjective.&apos;

5 Notice that there are three things that are taken as evidence that a sentence is subjective only in the
continuing-subjective situation: being a nonprivate-state sentence, being in the perfective, and being in
the progressive, Caenepeel (1989), in work done simultaneously, analyzed aspect and perspective
linguistically, and reached similar conclusions with respect to these three types of evidence. Caenepeel
suggests that states appearing in what I call the continuing-subjective situation continue the current
FOV. Her notion of state includes sentences in the perfective and progressive aspects, regardless of the
type of state of affairs that the sentence is about. It might be desirable to revise this aspect of the
algorithm on the basis of her work, which focused on aspect, to arrive at a more general treatment of
these three kinds of evidence in this situation.

the bare dirt. 29 &apos;He had heard it said that Ned had never got over
the war, which might have explained it. [McMurtry, Lonesome Dove,
p. 176]
All of these sentences are Call&apos;s subjective sentences. Thus, the text situation is continu-
ing-subjective after each of them. Sentences (29.1), (29.3), and (29.7) are Call&apos;s private-
state reports, and (29.2) and (29.4) contain potential subjective elements that are as-
sociated with other situations—and not merely the continuing-subjective one (&apos;might&apos;
in (29.2) and &apos;if even&apos; in (29.4)). The interesting sentences are (29.5) and (29.6), since
they contain potential subjective elements that are associated only with the continuing-
subjective situation (the past perfective in (29.5) and the progressive in (29.6)). (These
sentences express Call&apos;s reasons for his belief, expressed in (29.4), that &amp;quot;she had come
a long way down.&amp;quot;)
In the following passage, a subjective element appears in a situation other than
continuing-subjective. The situation is continuing-subjective at the beginning, and
Sandy is the last subjective character.

305So this was a seraph. 30 6Tall, even taller than the twins. [L&apos;Engle,

Sentence (30.1) continues Sandy&apos;s subjective context, because it contains the subjective
elements &apos;incredibly&apos; and comparative &apos;like.&apos; Sentences (30.2)–(30.4) are objective, and
a paragraph break appears before (30.5), so the situation at the beginning of (30.5) is
postsubjective-nonactive (one of the situations in (30) and the last subjective character,
Sandy, is an expected subjective character. The algorithm is able to recognize that (30.5)
is Sandy&apos;s subjective sentence, because it contains &apos;so&apos; used as a conjunct, which is
subjective as long as there is an expected subjective character.
Consider passage (19) (reprinted here); recall that it is the beginning of a novel,
so there isn&apos;t an expected subjective character when it is encountered.

There are scene breaks after (31.3) and after (31.12). Between the breaks, there are no
private-state sentences or narrative parentheticals, and, since none of the creatures in
the scene has been the SC, there are no sentences with active characters (this is true
for the elided sentences as well). Thus, if none of the potential subjective elements
are subjective, then there are no expected subjective characters from (31.4) to (31.12).
There are strong potential subjective elements that would be subjective if there were
an expected subjective character—&apos;seemingly&apos; in (31.7), &apos;sound&apos; in (31.9), &apos;yet&apos; used
as a conjunct and &apos;seemed&apos; in (31.10), &apos;oddly&apos; in (31.11), and a sentence fragment in
(31.12). However, since these are associated at the highest level with the situations in
(3k), and not with the presubjective-nonactive situation, the algorithm correctly does
not interpret them to be subjective.
There are three things to note about passages such as (31). First, the potential for an
overt narrator to appear is strong when there isn&apos;t an expected subjective character and
a strong element such as &apos;seemingly&apos; appears; my restriction to texts that do not have
overt narrators allows the algorithm to exclude this possibility from consideration.
Second, the algorithm does not revise its decision as to whether a sentence is subjective
in light of later sentences. However, one could imagine a sentence within passage (31)
that might cause the reader to decide that earlier sentences were actually subjective. For
example, the following sentence, inserted after (31.10), would suggest this: &amp;quot;Dennys
was mystified by the spectacle.&amp;quot; The algorithm would interpret this sentence to be

subjective; this would affect its interpretation of the remainder of the passage—the
algorithm would interpret the potential subjective elements in (31.11) and (31.12) to be
subjective—but it would not affect its interpretation of earlier sentences. Third, to be
conservative, only Banfield&apos;s emotive and evaluative subjective elements, which must
be understood to express someone&apos;s emotions or evaluations, are associated with the
presubjective-nonactive situation (4). As mentioned in Section 8.2.4, the number of
sentences that appear in this situation is relatively small, and, of those that do, many
are private-state reports or have narrative parentheticals. It may be that some of the
potential subjective elements associated at the highest level with the situations in (30
should also be associated with the one in (40; the appearance of the relevant kind of
subjective sentence in this situation was too rare in the texts examined to decide this.
Because there are 34 classes of potential subjective elements, the majority of which
have multiple members (Wiebe 1990), a significant number of each potential subjec-
tive element in each situation was not found. The association of elements with text
situations is based on the examples that were found, and, for the ones that did not
appear very often in the texts examined, on my judgments as to which of the ones that
did appear often are closest to them in strength. Psychological experiments (with Gail
Bruder) of this aspect of the algorithm are underway. We plan to revise the association
of potential subjective elements with text situations as needed in light of the results.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.699055">
9.5 Quoted Speech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.910036863636364">
In quoted speech, there are two points of view: the point of view taken by the quoted
string—the speaker&apos;s—and the one taken by the discourse parenthetical, which may
be objective or a character&apos;s.&apos; It is the point of view taken by the discourse paren-
thetical that concerns us here: the speaker&apos;s point of view is not directly presented
by a quoted string, as the subjective character&apos;s is by a subjective sentence, but is
conveyed indirectly through a communicative act. Quoted speech is a major way of
communicating the beliefs, intentions, etc., of characters who are not to become the
SC; merely the fact that what a character says expresses her point of view should not
lead the reader to anticipate later subjective sentences of that character, as the reader
does after a subjective sentence.
Therefore, the algorithm considers subjective elements that appear in discourse
parentheticals, but not those within quoted strings. For example:
(32)
&amp;quot;I&apos;ll talk to Amy,&amp;quot; Daddy said, &amp;quot;and make sure she behaves herself.&amp;quot;
[Sachs, Amy and Laura, p. 1001
The subjective element &apos;Daddy&apos; in the discourse parenthetical is attributed to an ex-
pected subjective character, Laura. In contrast, the algorithm interprets the following
sentence from passage (20) to be objective, even though there is a question in the
quoted string:
&amp;quot;Drown me?&amp;quot; Augustus said.
7 See Banfield (1982) for a principled account of the relationship between the points of view of a quoted
string and its discourse parenthetical.

10. A Return to Private-State Sentences
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.998563">
In contrast to what was implied in Section 8.3.2, there are some subjective elements that
do not suggest that a private-state sentence is a represented thought, even when they
are nonsubordinated. First, Cohn (1978) shows that private-state reports8 do not always
report private states experienced specifically at the current moment in the story, but
instead have &amp;quot;almost unlimited temporal flexibility&amp;quot; (p. 34). One consequence of this is
that private-state reports can be habitual. Second, Cohn (1978) also shows that private-
state reports can employ simile.&apos; Thus, comparative &apos;like&apos; can appear nonsubordinated
in private-state reports. For example:
His [Sandy&apos;s] head began to swell, to be filled with hot air like a
balloon, so that he was afraid he was going to float off into the sky.
[L&apos;Engle, Many Waters, p. 27]
Finally, some intensifier adverbs, when nonsubordinated in a private-state report,
simply indicate the degree to which the private state is experienced. An example
is &apos;hardly,&apos; as in:
Sandy, his flannel shift still draped over his head, was hardly aware
that he was supporting his brother. [L&apos;Engle, Many Waters, p. 27]
Sentence (34), as it appears in the novel, is Sandy&apos;s private-state report.
Given these observations, we need to revise the algorithm as presented so far: the
algorithm does not consider the above types of subjective elements when it decides
who the SC of a private-state sentence is, even when they are nonsubordinated to the
private-state term.

A private-state action is an action from which a private state can be inferred. Exam-
ples are looking, glancing, sighing, frowning, smiling, and shivering. In contrast to a
private-state report such as &amp;quot;She was unhappy,&amp;quot; the sentence &amp;quot;She frowned&amp;quot; narrates
a private-state action from which unhappiness or displeasure can be inferred, but does
not directly report the character&apos;s private state.&apos; In a given context, the private state
that can be inferred may or may not be significant for tracking point of view. It is
significant in the following passage:

As this passage appears in the novel, (35.2)–(35.4) continue the subjective context estab-
lished by (35.1)—they are subjective sentences presenting what Zoe sees. Interpreting
(35.1) to be subjective, the algorithm is able to recognize that (35.2)–(35.4) are also sub-
jective, because the past perfective is a subjective element in the continuing-subjective
situation, and it is able to determine that the SC is Zoe, because she is the last sub-
jective character. On the other hand, a private-state action sentence might not be the
subjective sentence of the actor; an example is (36.1):

himself did not seem to feel the intense heat. [L&apos;Engle, Many Waters,

<bodyText confidence="0.9999786">
As this passage appears in the novel, (36.3) is the subjective sentence of the last sub-
jective character, Sandy and Dennys. If (36.1) were Japheth&apos;s subjective sentence, then
it would be to Japheth that the subjective element &apos;seem&apos; in (36.3) would be attributed,
rather than to Sandy and Dennys.
Like quoted speech, a private-state-action sentence is a way to communicate some-
thing about the consciousness of a character who is not to become the SC. The reader
infers from (36.1) that Japheth sees the people he is looking at; however, there are no
subsequent subjective sentences about what he sees, such as the sentences in (35) that
show what Zoe sees.
The first decision to be made when one encounters a private-state-action sentence
is whether it should be treated as a private-state sentence or as an action sentence.
Whether the sentence is subjective and, if so, who the SC is then depend upon the
factors already presented.
The algorithm&apos;s treatment of these sorts of sentences is based on the observation
that a more direct appeal to a character&apos;s consciousness, such as a private-state report
or a narrative parenthetical, is usually used to establish a character as an SC for the
first time. Thus, the actor of a private-state-action sentence that is the actor&apos;s subjective
sentence has usually been the SC before. While consistency in the interpretation of a
passage with this sort of sentence must be supported by other factors, this regularity
is a strong one in the texts examined.
Thus, if the actor has been a SC, then the algorithm treats a private-state-action
sentence s as it would have treated a private-state sentence in the same context; oth-
erwise, it treats s as it would have treated an action sentence in the same context (see
Wiebe [19901 for illustrations of the various consequences of treating s one way or the
other).

12. Tests of the Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995824">
This section summarizes the tests of the algorithm that have been performed.
First, the algorithm was hand-simulated on over 700 pages (roughly 17,500 sen-
tential input items) from 7 novels that represent a range in the number of different
subjective characters they contain. Given the large amount of data and the prepro-
cessing requirements of running the algorithm, the purpose of this test was not to
compile statistical measures, but rather to find out what kinds of exceptions occur.
Generally, point of view is manipulated in these novels as expected by the algorithm.
Of the exceptions, many can be attributed to problems that are specifically not ad-
dressed in this work, such as how the spatial and temporal points of view affect the
psychological one (discussed in the next section), how point of view is manipulated in

relatively rare situations, such as the very beginning of a novel, and what constitutes
a &amp;quot;significant&amp;quot; subjective context for the purpose of interpreting private-state-action
sentences (discussed in Appendix C). (The classes of errors and examples of them are
given in Wiebe [1990].)
In order to obtain more specific numeric results, the algorithm was tested, and
results tabulated, for a more modest amount of text (32 pages with 900 sentential
input items). The results are positive, and are given in Appendix C. Fully testing the
algorithm would require a much larger corpus, in which a significant number of each
of the possibilities arises. Such testing would be a major endeavor in itself.
Finally, as mentioned in Section 8.3.1, we have performed psychological experi-
ments that showed that readers&apos; interpretations of private-state sentences are affected
by paragraph breaks as we predicted on the basis of the algorithm (Bruder and Wiebe
1990 and in press). We are continuing this line of research with psychological experi-
ments of other aspects of the algorithm.

13. Relation to Anaphora Resolution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956673333333333">
A question likely to arise in the reader&apos;s mind is how tracking POV and anaphora
resolution are related. Anaphora resolution is necessary for tracking POV (the actors
and experiencers of states of affairs must be known; see item (4) of Section 6.1). But it
is certainly not sufficient, arid an additional mechanism is needed. A case that clearly
illustrates this is a private-state sentence in which the experiencer is referred to with
a pronoun, such as:
(37) He hated holidays.
Resolving the pronoun is not sufficient for identifying the SC of (37), since the SC may
or may not be the referent of &apos;he&apos; (see Section 8.3.2).
However, the pipeline architecture of the algorithm is not realistic. Almost cer-
tainly, POV affects anaphora resolution, and also recognizing the discourse structure
of the text. Specific issues I am exploring are discussed in the next section.

14. Directions for Future Research and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997594117647">
One direction for future research is investigating the interactions of different points of
view. A large class of exceptions to the algorithm can be attributed to interactions be-
tween the spatial and temporal points of view and the psychological one. For example,
there are spatial and temporal discontinuities other than scene breaks after which a
character should no longer be expected: the current &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; in the story may
shift away from the character, or the character may leave the scene while the &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; remain unchanged. These situations must be distinguished from the situ-
ation, occurring with represented thoughts, in which there is a &amp;quot;projected here&amp;quot; and
a &amp;quot;projected now&amp;quot; of events that are being thought about, and from the situation in
represented perception in which there is a &amp;quot;projected here&amp;quot; of events being perceived
(Bruder et al. 1986; Rapaport et al. 1989a, 1989b).
An important area of future research is investigating interactions among tracking
POV, recognizing discourse structure, and anaphora resolution. I am currently focusing
on discourse structure within subjective contexts. We can view a subjective context
as presenting a sequence of private states, where the experiencers and attitudes of
some are only implicit (in the case of represented thoughts). In addition to discourse
relations among sentences as wholes, there can be discourse relations among objects of

private states, even a hierarchical structure involving several such objects. As a concrete
example, the contrast signaled by the cue-phrase &apos;but&apos; appearing in a represented
thought may be between a represented thought and the object of a previous private-
state report. One example of a potential effect on pronoun resolution: if a sentence s is
to be interpreted as a represented thought, and is to be incorporated into a discourse-
segment structure among previous private-state objects, then pronouns in s can be
resolved against the focus space(s) corresponding to the private-state-object segments
(as in Grosz and Sidner&apos;s [1986] theory). Of course, determining whether or not s is to
be so interpreted is a difficult problem. But such interactions among POV, discourse
structure, and anaphora resolution might be usefully cast as constraints, with evidence
regarding interpretation with respect to one limiting the options to be pursued for the
others.
The psychological POV is related to other pragmatic and discourse phenomena.
Subjective contexts are paragraph-level analogs of opaque contexts in belief reports
(Wiebe [1991] specifically addresses this issue). In addition, the discourse phenomena
identified by Fauconnier (1985) are similar to the psychological point of view. Just as
a private-state report can begin a discourse segment in which subsequent sentences
are understood to continue a character&apos;s point of view, an adverbial such as &amp;quot;in 1969&amp;quot;
can begin a discourse segment in which subsequent sentences are understood to refer
to events that occurred in 1969, even though the date is not subsequently mentioned.
Or, consider discussing someone else&apos;s work, say Smith&apos;s, in a research paper or text-
book. After an initial reference to Smith&apos;s work, you may go on to describe his or
her theory without explicitly saying in each sentence that you are doing so (with a
locution such as &amp;quot;Smith shows that,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;In Smith&apos;s theory,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;In Smith&apos;s algorithm,&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;According to Smith&amp;quot;) (William J. Rapaport, personal communication). Along with
subjective contexts, an NLU system must be able to recognize such discourse phe-
nomena in order to recover information implicitly communicated in the discourse. A
detailed investigation of one of them suggests directions for investigating the others.
The one investigated here, subjective contexts in particular kinds of texts, is a good
one to investigate because it is possible to constrain the problem, because there are so
many prototypical instances in those kinds of texts, and because there is a great deal
of previous work in linguistics and literary theory to build upon.
In conclusion, this paper presented an algorithm for tracking the psychological
point of view in third-person fictional narrative text. The algorithm is based on regu-
larities, found by extensive examination of naturally occurring narratives, in the ways
that authors manipulate point of view. The algorithm has been implemented, pre-
liminary empirical studies have been performed, which support the algorithm, and
psychological experimentation is continuing. This is the first detailed computational
approach to the problem of tracking the psychological point of view.

Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998855647058824">
The algorithm has been implemented in two systems. Both implement functions POV,
NEW-CONTEXT, and NEW-CONTEXT&apos;, and neither implements function ITEM. The system
demonstrated here takes actual sentences as input, so has a component for performing
function FEATURES. However, it does not truly implement FEATURES, but is successful
in computing the FeatureSet of a sentence only for sentences that fall within its limited
coverage. It requires many actual sentences of a text to be simplified.
The other version of the system queries the user for the information returned by
function FEATURES, to enable the algorithm to be tested on unlimited text, without
concern for problems not addressed in this work.
Both systems are implemented using the SNePS knowledge representation and
reasoning system (Shapiro 1979; Shapiro and Rapaport 1987) and an ATN grammar
(Shapiro 1982). The grammar of the system demonstrated here is an extension of
others developed at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and includes pieces of
programs written by Soon Ae Chun (Chun 1987), Zuzana Dobes, Naicong Li (Li 1987),
Sandra Peters (Peters and Shapiro 1987a, 1987b; Peters, Shapiro, and Rapaport 1988),
William J. Rapaport (Rapaport 1986), and Stuart C. Shapiro (Shapiro 1982; Shapiro and
Rapaport 1987).

In the following, input to the system is preceded by a colon, comments are preceded
by percent signs, and all other lines are the system&apos;s output. To save space, extraneous
messages have been deleted, such as those concerned with entering and exiting the
system. Sentences of quoted speech are input simply as &apos;Quoted_speech&apos; followed by
a discourse parenthetical, since the algorithm does not consider the contents of the
quoted string.
The system is first demonstrated on the following passage; when the passage is en-
countered in the novel, the situation is postsubjective-non.active and the last subjective
character is Sandy and Dennys.

<abstract confidence="0.99840703030303">Third-person fictional narrative text is composed not only of passages that objectively narrate events, but also of passages that present characters&apos; thoughts, perceptions, and inner states. passages take a character&apos;s point of view. language understander must determine the current psychological point of view in order to distinguish the beliefs of the characters from the facts of the story, to correctly attribute beliefs and other attitudes to their sources, and to understand the discourse relations among sentences. Tracking the psychological point of view is not a trivial problem, because many sentences are not explicitly marked for point of view, and whether the point of view of a sentence is objective or that of a character (and if the latter, which character it is) often depends on the context in which the sentence appears. Tracking the psychological point of view is the problem addressed in this work. The approach is to seek, by extensive examinations of naturally occurring narrative, regularities in the ways that authors manipulate point of view, and to develop an algorithm that tracks point of view on the basis of the regularities found. This paper presents this algorithm, gives demonstrations of an implemented system, and describes the results of some preliminary empirical studies, which lend support to the algorithm. Imagine that a language u.nderstander encounters the following passage while reading a novel: (1) [Sandy] wanted to talk to Dennys. were they going to be able to get home from this strange desert land into which they had been cast and which was heaven knew where in all the countless solar in all the countless galaxies? [L&apos;Engle, Waters, 91] In this passage, the author is not objectively narrating events or describing the fictional world, but is presenting the thoughts and emotions of a character. It is to Sandy that the land is strange, and it is Sandy&apos;s uncertainty that is expressed by the question and the expression &apos;heaven knew where.&apos; Unless the language understander realizes these things, it hasn&apos;t fully understood the passage. such as (1) take a character&apos;s point of view are composed of subjective sentences—sentences that present the thoughts, perceptions, and inner states of characters in the story. Notice that nothing in (1.2) explicitly specifies the sentence is Sandy&apos;s thought. In general, only a parenthetical, &apos;Dennys thought&apos; in (2), serves to both that a sentence is subjective who its character is.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.990338476190476">25] In all other cases, one must rely on less direct sources of information to determine the psychological point of view. This paper presents an algorithm for recognizing subjective sentences and identifying their subjective characters in third-person fictional narrative text. The algorithm is based on regularities, found by extensive examination of naturally occurring text (i.e., published novels and short stories) in the ways that authors manipulate point of view. It has been implemented, and some preliminary empirical studies, which lend support to the algorithm, have also been performed. The algorithm is described in the body of the paper and is given in full in Appendix A. Sections 2-5 give background information and describe my approach to the problem. Sections 6 and 7 present an overview of the algorithm, specifying the input and output of the basic components and identifying the components focused on in this work. Sections 8-10 present the bulk of the algorithm, addressing the problem of identifying subjective characters before the problem of recognizing subjective sentences. 11 describes the algorithm&apos;s treatment of sentences about actions, such as sighing and looking. Sections 12-14 conclude the paper with a summary of tests of the algorithm and discussions of the relationship between tracking point of view and anaphora resolution and of directions for future research. The algorithm is given in Appendix A, demonstrations of its implementation are given in Appendix B, and the results of a test of the algorithm are given in Appendix C.</abstract>

Moreover, drastic spatial and temporal discontinuities can block the continuation or resumption of a character&apos;s psychological POV. This paper considers one such kind of discontinuity, a scene break. The condition under which the last subjective character of context is an expected subjective character is when a subjective sentence has appeared in the current scene. That is, LAsT-SC-Is-AN-ExPEcTED-SC (contexti) is true if TEXT-SiruKrioN-Or(contexti) {presubjective-nonactive, presubjective-active}. A scene break is a break from one parallel story-line to another.

Although various points of view often coincide in third-person narrative text, they need not. For example, a passage may take a character&apos;s spatial and temporal points of view without taking the psychological point of view of any character (Uspensky 1973). It is the psychological point of view we are concerned with in this paper. 234 Janyce M. Wiebe Tracking Point of View in Narrative 2.2 Subjective Sentences Following Ann Banfield (1982), a literary theorist who analyzes point of view linguistically, we shall call sentences that take a character&apos;s psychological point of view (hereafter, simply point of view or POV) subjective, in contrast to sentences that objectively narrate events or describe the fictional world. Subjective sentences present private states of characters—states of an experiencer holding an attitude, optionally toward an object. Varieties of private states include intellectual ones, such as someone believing, wondering, or knowing something; emotive ones, such as someone hating something or being afraid; and </context>
<context position="8043" citStr="Banfield 1982" startWordPosition="1248" endWordPosition="1249"> (p,experiencer,attitude,object) where experiencer is the person in state p, and attitude is know, believe, see, or whatever sort of private state p is. Notice that &amp;quot;attitude&amp;quot; is being used as a general covering term, referring to a class of which the propositional attitudes are only a subclass. We shall limit our scope in this paper mainly to two classes of subjective sentences, one containing those Banfield calls &amp;quot;represented thoughts&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;represented perceptions,&amp;quot; and the other containing those I call &amp;quot;private-state reports.&amp;quot; We will not consider represented speech at all (Jespersen 1924; Banfield 1982), because of its complexity, and only toward the end of the paper (Section 11) will we consider a variant of private-state reports: subjective sentences about private-state actions. Even restricting one&apos;s attention to the two classes mentioned above, there are many syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic features according to which one could characterize subjective sentences. Below I propose a view of subjective sentences that is useful for the specific purpose of tracking FOV. For characterizations that include further and alternative distinctions, see, for example, the following works in literary</context>
<context position="10656" citStr="Banfield 1982" startWordPosition="1648" endWordPosition="1649">e character (SC) of that sentence. The SC is the subject of a narrative parenthetical, when one is present; the implicit experiencer, when the sentence is a represented thought or represented perception without a narrative parenthetical; and the explicit experiencer, when the sentence is a private-state report. In addition to private-state terms such as &apos;know&apos; and &apos;see,&apos; subjective sentences can contain subjective elements, linguistic elements that express attitudes of the SC (this aspect of subjective sentences is noted in many studies of POV; the term &amp;quot;subjective element&amp;quot; is attributable to Banfield 1982). An example appears in the following passage (throughout this paper, sentences in cited passages are indented to reflect paragraphing in the original texts). 41&amp;quot;What are you doing in here?&amp;quot; 42Sudden1y she [Zoe] was furious with him floe]. 43&amp;quot;Spying, of course.&amp;quot; 4 4&amp;quot;Well of all dumb things! 4-51 thought you ran away.&amp;quot; 46joe Bunch was awful. [Oneal, War Work, p. 130] The adjective &amp;quot;awful&amp;quot; in (4.6) is a subjective element, expressing Zoe&apos;s evaluation of Joe (that he is awful). Notice that (4.6) is a represented thought—Zoe thought is implicit— and (4.2) is a private-state report, reporting Zoe&apos;s</context>
<context position="15111" citStr="Banfield 1982" startWordPosition="2383" endWordPosition="2384">s thought expressing his goal to avoid notice, and also his belief about how to achieve it. Understanding this is necessary for the reader to perceive the intentionality behind the action described in (7.3). In addition to being important for plan recognition, tracking POV is necessary to distinguish what is true in the fictional world from what is believed by the characters. While objective sentences are unquestionably true in the fictional world, subjective sentences reflect the subjective character&apos;s beliefs, which may be false in the fictional world (Uspensky 1973; Kuroda 1976; Cohn 1978; Banfield 1982). A striking example is the following: (8) This was David&apos;s boy. [Bridgers, All Together Now, p. 911 Sentence (8) is actually about a female character named &amp;quot;Casey.&amp;quot; However, it is the represented thought of a character who believes that Casey is a boy, and reflects this false belief about her. Beliefs and intentions are just two of many types of attitudes communicated by subjective sentences (see Dyer [1983] for a processing model of how various attitudes can be related to goals). The algorithm for tracking POV presented in this paper is intended to be just one part of an overall narrative-un</context>

But to accomplish such tasks, the system must recognize when attitudes are being presented in the first place and identify the character whose attitudes they are; these are the tasks involved in tracking the psychological POV. POV also has important implications for discourse processing. Discussion of this topic is deferred until Section 14. Sentences that present&apos; the attitudes of someone who is not the writer appear in genres other than third-person fictional narrative text, such as newspaper articles and textbooks (Banfield 1982), even if we might prefer another term than &amp;quot;represented thought&amp;quot; for such sentences. Thus, the problem of tracking POV arises for these other genres as well. Following is a passage from The New York Times (1990) that contains a &amp;quot;represented thought&amp;quot;: Looking at the more severely affected countries, experts are wondering where the saturation point will be. Where will the infection rate level off as most of those engaging in riskier behavior fall prey: 30 percent? 40 percent?

Further, by restricting the types of texts considered (see Section 2.2 above), it is possible to constrain the problem to choosing among an objective POV and the points of view of the characters. In genres such as soft news and editorials, for example, the writer may present his or her own attitudes; when attitudes of the writer, the speaker, or a narrator may be presented, the problem is less constrained. Hamburger (1973), Kuroda (1973), Banfield (1982), Galbraith (1990), and Wiebe (1991) address this issue more fully. Finally, there is a great deal of previous work to build upon, in linguistics and especially literary theory investigating POV in novels and short stories. 4. Approach Reasoning about whether a sentence is objective or the subjective sentence of this or that character is certainly part of tracking POV (Fillmore 1974). But it is reasonable to hypothesize that, in the face of all of the inferential possibilities, discourse expectations too are involved in tracking POV; that is, in the absence of an explicit indication of POV, re</context>

The results of these experiments are positive. I describe them as &amp;quot;preliminary&amp;quot; so as not to suggest that the entire algorithm has already been subjected to psychological experimentation. 5. Previous Work There are literary theorists and linguists who investigate linguistic aspects of subjective sentences. The present work greatly benefited from their investigations, most directly from Dole2e1 (1973), Uspensky (1973), Kuroda (1973, 1976), Fillmore (1974), Cohn (1978), and especially Banfield (1982). However, the relevant work in the above fields is descriptive only; it describes characteristics of subjective sentences, but does not address the problem of tracking POV. An exception is work on POV and aspect that shows that aspect is only a context-sensitive marker of subjectivity (Ehrlich [1987, 19901 and Caenepeel [1989j; see Section 9). In AT, Nakhimovsky (1988) suggests a discourse-processing approach to tracking POV, but does not develop it in any depth. Also, Reiser (1981) simply suggests that POV may be established by syntactic clues, and by including &amp;quot;more episodes and internal in</context>

To refer to the components of a context, we shall use the functions LAST-SC-OF, LAST-ACTIVE-CI TARACTER-OF, PREvious-SCS-OF, and TEXT-SITUATION-OF, which map a context C to the LastSC, LastActiveCharacter, PreviousSCs, and TextSituation of C, respectively. In the above definitions, LastSC, LastActiveCharacter, SC, and ActiveCharacter are sets, and PreviousSCs is a set of sets. This is because a subjective sentence can represent the shared psychological POV of more than one physical character (Banfield 1982). For example: (13) 13 &apos;Leaning out of the window side by side the two women watched the man 13 2NOw he threw away his cigarette. 133They watched him. 134What would he do next? [Woolf, The Years, p. 103; cited by Banfield 1982, p. 961 Sentence (13.4) is a represented thought whose SC is more than one physical character. 6.3 States of Affairs, Sentences, and Contexts: Some Further Details 6.3.1 States of Affairs.

In these cases, the SC of sentence s is chosen from among certain characters in FEATURES(s). Such a character need not be the last subjective character; when she is not, s initiates her POV. Thus, the cases discussed in this section—i.e., uses of sentences with certain features in particular contexts—are ways to initiate a character&apos;s POV. The straightforward case is when s contains a narrative parenthetical, such as sentence (2). The SC is always the subject of the parenthetical. The less straightforward case is when s is a private-state sentence. Doleel (1973), Cohn (1978), and Banfield (1982) all note that a private-state sentence is a way to initiate a character&apos;s POV. In the framework presented in this paper, the SC may be the experiencer of the private state, even if she is not the last subjective character. An example occurs in (20): (20) 20.1.,Drown me-&amp;quot; Augustus said. 20-2&amp;quot;Why if anybody had tried it, those girls would have clawed them to shreds.&amp;quot; 203He knew Call was mad, 204but wasn&apos;t much inclined to humor him. 205I1 was his dinner table as much as Call&apos;s, 20&apos;6and if Call didn&apos;t like the conversation he could go to bed. 20.7Call knew there was no point in arguing. &amp;quot;That wa</context>
<context position="65190" citStr="Banfield 1982" startWordPosition="10415" endWordPosition="10416">hat (22) and (23) are represented thoughts, you need to consider the context to identify their SCs. Thus, if a private-state sentence s contains some indication that s is a represented thought, then the SC cannot be identified from s itself, and, as discussed in Section 8.2, the expected subjective characters should be considered. Subjective elements indicate that a sentence is a represented thought (this statement is qualified later in this section and in Section 10). Subjective elements are linguistic elements that express emotions, uncertainty, evaluations, and other kinds of subjectivity (Banfield 1982) (they are discussed in detail in Section 9). Examples are evaluative terms such as &apos;the old bag&apos; (Bonfield 1982) and evidentials such as &apos;evidently&apos; and &apos;apparently&apos; (Dole2rel 1973). In the following passage, a subjective element indicates that the SC of a privatestate sentence is not the experiencer of the private state. At the start of the passage, Sandy and Dennys are (collectively) the last subjective character: 24.1Japheth, evidently realizing that they were no longer behind him, turned around 24.2and jogged back toward them, seemingly cool and unwinded. fL&apos;Engle, Many Waters, p. 24] The</context>

Point of View 2.1 Introduction In face-to-face conversation, an utterance is understood with respect to the situation in which the conversation takes place (Barwise and Perry 1983). Thus, deictic expressions such as snow,&apos; here,&amp;quot;come,&amp;quot;go,&apos; and &apos;just ahead&apos; derive their meanings from the time and place of the utterance (Fillmore 1975; Lyons 1977). In fictional narrative text, however, spatial and temporal deictic terms are clearly not understood with respect to the time and place of the author&apos;s writing nor of the reader&apos;s reading. Rather, they are understood with respect to a &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; within the story (Hamburger 1973; Kuroda 1976; Baufield 1982; Bruder et al. 1986; Rapaport et al. 1989a, 1989b).

Tables 2 and 3 list some potential subjective elements, giving very brief characterizations. For further details, see Wiebe (1990). All of the citations in Tables 2 and 3 are with respect to the linguistic categories of the elements. Some of those who discuss the appearance of the elements in subjective sentences are as follows: Banfield (1982) discusses (1), (2.1)—(2.3), (4), (5), and (12); Dolael (1973) discusses (1), (2.1)—(2.3), (5), (6.1), (6.2), and (8); Brinton (1980) discusses (9) (she shows that a simile can be a marker of represented perception) and (12); Ehrlich (1990) discusses (11), and Ehrlich (1987) discusses (12). The past perfective is potentially subjective simply because a character can reflect on what occurred (or might have occurred) in the past. However, as discussed by Ehrlich (1990) and many others, the narrative past may be expressed by the simplepast tense in the midst of a subjective context; detecting simple-past references to the past is not addressed in this work. 9.3 Recognizing Subjective Sentences Subjective elements are important</context>

The question of whether there is a psychological link between paragraph breaks and tracking POV has not been previously investigated. Stark (1987, 1988) performed psychological experiments that showed that there is a significant correlation between paragraph breaks and discourse discontinuities, but the sorts of discontinuities she investigated did not include changes in POV. Nakhimovsky and Rapaport (1988) suggest that in narrative, paragraph breaks accompany changes in POV, but they did not investigate this hypothesis experimentally. In fact, we have performed psychological experiments (Bruder and Wiebe 1990 and in press) that did establish such a link. Specifically, through manipulation of paragraph breaks in naturally occurring passages, the experiments showed that readers&apos; interpretations of private-state sentences are influenced by paragraph breaks as we predicted on the basis of the algorithm. 8.3.2 Subjective Elements.

The results are positive, and are given in Appendix C. Fully testing the algorithm would require a much larger corpus, in which a significant number of each of the possibilities arises. Such testing would be a major endeavor in itself. Finally, as mentioned in Section 8.3.1, we have performed psychological experiments that showed that readers&apos; interpretations of private-state sentences are affected by paragraph breaks as we predicted on the basis of the algorithm (Bruder and Wiebe 1990 and in press). We are continuing this line of research with psychological experiments of other aspects of the algorithm. 13. Relation to Anaphora Resolution A question likely to arise in the reader&apos;s mind is how tracking POV and anaphora resolution are related. Anaphora resolution is necessary for tracking POV (the actors and experiencers of states of affairs must be known; see item (4) of Section 6.1). But it is certainly not sufficient, arid an additional mechanism is needed. A case that clearly illustrates this is a private-state sentence in which the experiencer is referred to with a pron</context>

Thus, deictic expressions such as snow,&apos; here,&amp;quot;come,&amp;quot;go,&apos; and &apos;just ahead&apos; derive their meanings from the time and place of the utterance (Fillmore 1975; Lyons 1977). In fictional narrative text, however, spatial and temporal deictic terms are clearly not understood with respect to the time and place of the author&apos;s writing nor of the reader&apos;s reading. Rather, they are understood with respect to a &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; within the story (Hamburger 1973; Kuroda 1976; Baufield 1982; Bruder et al. 1986; Rapaport et al. 1989a, 1989b). Thus, the reader must track the spatial and temporal points of view with respect to which objects and events are described (Uspensky 1973). Knowing who the speaker is another situational component needed to understand conversation. Most obviously, the speaker is needed as the referent of first-person pronouns, but in addition she is the source of beliefs, emotions, evaluations, etc., expressed by her utterances. But in third-person narrative text, sentences can express a character&apos;s beliefs, emotions, etc., even when he or she is referred to in the third person</context>

These situations must be distinguished from the situation, occurring with represented thoughts, in which there is a &amp;quot;projected here&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;projected now&amp;quot; of events that are being thought about, and from the situation in represented perception in which there is a &amp;quot;projected here&amp;quot; of events being perceived (Bruder et al. 1986; Rapaport et al. 1989a, 1989b). An important area of future research is investigating interactions among tracking POV, recognizing discourse structure, and anaphora resolution. I am currently focusing on discourse structure within subjective contexts. We can view a subjective context as presenting a sequence of private states, where the experiencers and attitudes of some are only implicit (in the case of represented thoughts). In addition to discourse relations among sentences as wholes, there can be discourse relations among objects of 266 janyce M. Wiebe Tracking Point of View in Narrative </context>

Understanding this is necessary for the reader to perceive the intentionality behind the action described in (7.3). In addition to being important for plan recognition, tracking POV is necessary to distinguish what is true in the fictional world from what is believed by the characters. While objective sentences are unquestionably true in the fictional world, subjective sentences reflect the subjective character&apos;s beliefs, which may be false in the fictional world (Uspensky 1973; Kuroda 1976; Cohn 1978; Banfield 1982). A striking example is the following: (8) This was David&apos;s boy. [Bridgers, All Together Now, p. 911 Sentence (8) is actually about a female character named &amp;quot;Casey.&amp;quot; However, it is the represented thought of a character who believes that Casey is a boy, and reflects this false belief about her.

The results of these experiments are positive. I describe them as &amp;quot;preliminary&amp;quot; so as not to suggest that the entire algorithm has already been subjected to psychological experimentation. 5. Previous Work There are literary theorists and linguists who investigate linguistic aspects of subjective sentences. The present work greatly benefited from their investigations, most directly from Dole2e1 (1973), Uspensky (1973), Kuroda (1973, 1976), Fillmore (1974), Cohn (1978), and especially Banfield (1982). However, the relevant work in the above fields is descriptive only; it describes characteristics of subjective sentences, but does not address the problem of tracking POV. An exception is work on POV and aspect that shows that aspect is only a context-sensitive marker of subjectivity (Ehrlich [1987, 19901 and Caenepeel [1989j; see Section 9). In AT, Nakhimovsky (1988) suggests a discourse-processing approach to tracking POV, but does not develop it in any depth. Also, Reiser (1981) simply suggests that POV may be established by syntactic clues, and by includin</context>
<context position="58458" citStr="Cohn (1978)" startWordPosition="9326" endWordPosition="9327">text) 0 {}; see Section 8.1). In these cases, the SC of sentence s is chosen from among certain characters in FEATURES(s). Such a character need not be the last subjective character; when she is not, s initiates her POV. Thus, the cases discussed in this section—i.e., uses of sentences with certain features in particular contexts—are ways to initiate a character&apos;s POV. The straightforward case is when s contains a narrative parenthetical, such as sentence (2). The SC is always the subject of the parenthetical. The less straightforward case is when s is a private-state sentence. Doleel (1973), Cohn (1978), and Banfield (1982) all note that a private-state sentence is a way to initiate a character&apos;s POV. In the framework presented in this paper, the SC may be the experiencer of the private state, even if she is not the last subjective character. An example occurs in (20): (20) 20.1.,Drown me-&amp;quot; Augustus said. 20-2&amp;quot;Why if anybody had tried it, those girls would have clawed them to shreds.&amp;quot; 203He knew Call was mad, 204but wasn&apos;t much inclined to humor him. 205I1 was his dinner table as much as Call&apos;s, 20&apos;6and if Call didn&apos;t like the conversation he could go to bed. 20.7Call knew there was no point</context>

For example, Cohn (1978) says that represented thoughts can be distinguished from private-state reports by &amp;quot;the absence of mental verbs&amp;quot; in the former (p. 104). The SC of a private-state report is always the experiencer of the private state. So, if some oracle were to inform you that (21) is a private-state report, you would then know that the SC is the experiencer of the private state (John). On the other hand, if the oracle were to inform you that (21) is a represented thought, you could not then identify the SC just by looking at the sentence alone.

A Return to Private-State Sentences In contrast to what was implied in Section 8.3.2, there are some subjective elements that do not suggest that a private-state sentence is a represented thought, even when they are nonsubordinated. First, Cohn (1978) shows that private-state reports8 do not always report private states experienced specifically at the current moment in the story, but instead have &amp;quot;almost unlimited temporal flexibility&amp;quot; (p. 34). One consequence of this is that private-state reports can be habitual. Second, Cohn (1978) also shows that privatestate reports can employ simile.&apos; Thus, comparative &apos;like&apos; can appear nonsubordinated in private-state reports.

Of course, determining whether or not s is to be so interpreted is a difficult problem. But such interactions among POV, discourse structure, and anaphora resolution might be usefully cast as constraints, with evidence regarding interpretation with respect to one limiting the options to be pursued for the others. The psychological POV is related to other pragmatic and discourse phenomena. Subjective contexts are paragraph-level analogs of opaque contexts in belief reports (Wiebe [1991] specifically addresses this issue). In addition, the discourse phenomena identified by Fauconnier (1985) are similar to the psychological point of view. Just as a private-state report can begin a discourse segment in which subsequent sentences are understood to continue a character&apos;s point of view, an adverbial such as &amp;quot;in 1969&amp;quot; can begin a discourse segment in which subsequent sentences are understood to refer to events that occurred in 1969, even though the date is not subsequently mentioned. Or, consider discussing someone else&apos;s work, say Smith&apos;s, in a research paper or textbook. After an initial reference to Smith&apos;s work, you may go on to describe his or her theory without explicitly saying</context>

Thus, deictic expressions such as snow,&apos; here,&amp;quot;come,&amp;quot;go,&apos; and &apos;just ahead&apos; derive their meanings from the time and place of the utterance (Fillmore 1975; Lyons 1977).

In addition to being objective or a character&apos;s subjective sentence, a sentence may express the attitudes of an overt narrator (Chatman 1978). But this paper will focus only on texts without overt narrators. In addition, we will not consider passages with irony and humor that do not originate with a character, or passages that are written in the style of an epic, parable, or folktale. As well, we will not try to account for fiction that is experimental in its manipulation of POV. Finally, we will only consider narrative sentences in which the tenses are &amp;quot;shifted&amp;quot; (Jespersen 1924); that is, in which the simple past is used for the narrative present, and the past perfective is used for the narrative past. Note that it is not difficult to find published third-person texts that satisfy these criteria. 3. Importance of Tracking Point of View The importance to narrative understanding of recognizing characters&apos; intentions has long been recognized in Al (see, for example, Wilensky [19831 and Dyer [1983]).

One interesting issue not addressed in this paper is how one might represent the difference between, for example, &amp;quot;John wondered where he was&amp;quot; and&amp;quot; &apos;Where was he?&apos; John wondered.&amp;quot; But one distinction that is crucial for tracking POV is the distinction between the interpretation of a sentence as either objective or subjective, and the kinds of states of affairs that the sentence is about. The former is a pragmatic issue, concerning the use of a sentence to present objective or subjective information about the fictional world (Kuroda 1976). The latter is a semantic issue, concerning the word senses of lexical items in the sentence. For instance, (5) below can be used to objectively narrate a past action or to portray a character&apos;s thought of one. Tn either case, the sentence is about an action. (5) Gus had taken them back to town. Now consider (6): (6) Gus had a cornish hen. Whether the word sense of &apos;had&apos; in (6) is a state or an action (eating) is a separate question from whether the sentence is objective or subjective (similarly, Hirst [1987] 236 Janyce M.

Rather, (7.2) is Jeff&apos;s thought expressing his goal to avoid notice, and also his belief about how to achieve it. Understanding this is necessary for the reader to perceive the intentionality behind the action described in (7.3). In addition to being important for plan recognition, tracking POV is necessary to distinguish what is true in the fictional world from what is believed by the characters. While objective sentences are unquestionably true in the fictional world, subjective sentences reflect the subjective character&apos;s beliefs, which may be false in the fictional world (Uspensky 1973; Kuroda 1976; Cohn 1978; Banfield 1982). A striking example is the following: (8) This was David&apos;s boy. [Bridgers, All Together Now, p. 911 Sentence (8) is actually about a female character named &amp;quot;Casey.&amp;quot; However, it is the represented thought of a character who believes that Casey is a boy, and reflects this false belief about her. Beliefs and intentions are just two of many types of attitudes communicated by subjective sentences (see Dyer [1983] for a processing model of how various attitudes can be related to goals).

The algorithm is given in Appendix A, demonstrations of its implementation are given in Appendix B, and the results of a test of the algorithm are given in Appendix C. 2. Point of View 2.1 Introduction In face-to-face conversation, an utterance is understood with respect to the situation in which the conversation takes place (Barwise and Perry 1983). Thus, deictic expressions such as snow,&apos; here,&amp;quot;come,&amp;quot;go,&apos; and &apos;just ahead&apos; derive their meanings from the time and place of the utterance (Fillmore 1975; Lyons 1977). In fictional narrative text, however, spatial and temporal deictic terms are clearly not understood with respect to the time and place of the author&apos;s writing nor of the reader&apos;s reading. Rather, they are understood with respect to a &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; within the story (Hamburger 1973; Kuroda 1976; Baufield 1982; Bruder et al. 1986; Rapaport et al. 1989a, 1989b). Thus, the reader must track the spatial and temporal points of view with respect to which objects and events are described (Uspensky 1973). Knowing who the speaker is another situational component needed to understand conversation. Mo</context>

The present work greatly benefited from their investigations, most directly from Dole2e1 (1973), Uspensky (1973), Kuroda (1973, 1976), Fillmore (1974), Cohn (1978), and especially Banfield (1982). However, the relevant work in the above fields is descriptive only; it describes characteristics of subjective sentences, but does not address the problem of tracking POV. An exception is work on POV and aspect that shows that aspect is only a context-sensitive marker of subjectivity (Ehrlich [1987, 19901 and Caenepeel [1989j; see Section 9). In AT, Nakhimovsky (1988) suggests a discourse-processing approach to tracking POV, but does not develop it in any depth. Also, Reiser (1981) simply suggests that POV may be established by syntactic clues, and by including &amp;quot;more episodes and internal information&amp;quot; about a character (p. 209). 239 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 context &lt;— {} , presubjective-nonactive) loop if -SENTENcE(ITEM(text, i)) then context NEW-CoNTExT&apos;(ITEm(text, i), context) else interpretation POV(FEATuREs(Imm(texi-,i)),context) context NEw-CoNTExT (interpretation , context) end if i i + 1 end loop Ilmr•Ceerrarr Tear Pea re tc.

When a private-state sentence appears in the continuing-subjective situation, therefore, the algorithm identifies the SC to be the last SC rather than the experiencer of the private state. The question of whether there is a psychological link between paragraph breaks and tracking POV has not been previously investigated. Stark (1987, 1988) performed psychological experiments that showed that there is a significant correlation between paragraph breaks and discourse discontinuities, but the sorts of discontinuities she investigated did not include changes in POV. Nakhimovsky and Rapaport (1988) suggest that in narrative, paragraph breaks accompany changes in POV, but they did not investigate this hypothesis experimentally. In fact, we have performed psychological experiments (Bruder and Wiebe 1990 and in press) that did establish such a link. Specifically, through manipulation of paragraph breaks in naturally occurring passages, the experiments showed that readers&apos; interpretations of private-state sentences are influenced by paragraph breaks as we predicted on the basis of the algorithm. 8.3.2 Subjective Elements.

That Zoe is the speaker is in FEATURES(s) (see items (2) and (4) of section 6.1 and the end of section 6.3.1). the result is soa, (if there is more than one such soai, one is randomly chosen) else the result is soa,„,„. Table 1 gives some examples. Note that private-state terms appearing in certain types of constituents cannot be used to report private states. An example is a manner adverbial (Quirk et al. 1985), such as the italicized portion of &amp;quot;Japheth turned the book over in a puzzled manner.&amp;quot; (There are others addressed in Wiebe [1990], but because of space limitations, we shall ignore them in this paper.) The phrase &amp;quot;in a puzzled manner&amp;quot; does not report a private state, but rather describes the manner in which something is done. The state of affairs chosen for this sentence is simply the main-clause action. To facilitate discussion, a sentential InputItem of which the state of affairs chosen for consideration is of type X will be called an &amp;quot;X sentence,&amp;quot; for example, &amp;quot;action sentence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;private-state sentence.&amp;quot; 6.3.4 The Text Situations.

We shall say that pse is associated at the highest level with the situations in it,. In addition to potential subjective elements, there is another source of information the algorithm considers: the type of state of affairs the sentence is about. First, privatestate action sentences can be subjective; see Section 11. Second, private-state sentences are usually subjective (we are not considering objective private-state sentences in this paper; see Wiebe [1990] and footnote 4). Third, a nonprivate-state sentence in the continuing-subjective situation usually continues the subjective context. For example: 28 &apos;Lorena didn&apos;t like it that Gus acted like Jake wasn&apos;t much. &apos;Fie had a reputation for being a cool man in a fight. [McMurtry, Lonesome Dove, p. 1901 Sentence (28.1) is Lorena&apos;s subjective sentence, and (28.2), a nonprivate-state sentence, continues her subjective context. In the continuing-subjective situation, therefore, the algorithm interprets a nonprivate-state sentence to be subjective.&apos; 9.4 Examples and Discussion Consider the following pa</context>

Of the exceptions, many can be attributed to problems that are specifically not addressed in this work, such as how the spatial and temporal points of view affect the psychological one (discussed in the next section), how point of view is manipulated in 265 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 relatively rare situations, such as the very beginning of a novel, and what constitutes a &amp;quot;significant&amp;quot; subjective context for the purpose of interpreting private-state-action sentences (discussed in Appendix C). (The classes of errors and examples of them are given in Wiebe [1990].) In order to obtain more specific numeric results, the algorithm was tested, and results tabulated, for a more modest amount of text (32 pages with 900 sentential input items). The results are positive, and are given in Appendix C. Fully testing the algorithm would require a much larger corpus, in which a significant number of each of the possibilities arises. Such testing would be a major endeavor in itself.

Subjective sentences present private states of characters—states of an experiencer holding an attitude, optionally toward an object. Varieties of private states include intellectual ones, such as someone believing, wondering, or knowing something; emotive ones, such as someone hating something or being afraid; and perceptual ones, such as someone seeing or hearing something. Thus, private states are states that are not open to objective observation or verification (Quirk et al. 1985). To refer to a private state p and its components, we shall write: Ps (p,experiencer,attitude,object) where experiencer is the person in state p, and attitude is know, believe, see, or whatever sort of private state p is. Notice that &amp;quot;attitude&amp;quot; is being used as a general covering term, referring to a class of which the propositional attitudes are only a subclass. We shall limit our scope in this paper mainly to two classes of subjective sentences, one containing those Banfield calls &amp;quot;represented thoughts&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;represented perceptions,&amp;quot; and the other containing those I call &amp;quot;private-state repo</context>

If Y were also the SC of P, then a shift would have occurred, from X&apos;s POV to Y&apos;s POV, without a paragraph break. The fact that no paragraph break appears—that is, that P is in the continuingsubjective situation—suggests that P continues X&apos;s POV rather than initiating Y&apos;s. When a private-state sentence appears in the continuing-subjective situation, therefore, the algorithm identifies the SC to be the last SC rather than the experiencer of the private state. The question of whether there is a psychological link between paragraph breaks and tracking POV has not been previously investigated. Stark (1987, 1988) performed psychological experiments that showed that there is a significant correlation between paragraph breaks and discourse discontinuities, but the sorts of discontinuities she investigated did not include changes in POV. Nakhimovsky and Rapaport (1988) suggest that in narrative, paragraph breaks accompany changes in POV, but they did not investigate this hypothesis experimentally. In fact, we have performed psychological experiments (Bruder and Wiebe 1990 and in press) that did establish such a link.

In fictional narrative text, however, spatial and temporal deictic terms are clearly not understood with respect to the time and place of the author&apos;s writing nor of the reader&apos;s reading. Rather, they are understood with respect to a &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; within the story (Hamburger 1973; Kuroda 1976; Baufield 1982; Bruder et al. 1986; Rapaport et al. 1989a, 1989b). Thus, the reader must track the spatial and temporal points of view with respect to which objects and events are described (Uspensky 1973). Knowing who the speaker is another situational component needed to understand conversation. Most obviously, the speaker is needed as the referent of first-person pronouns, but in addition she is the source of beliefs, emotions, evaluations, etc., expressed by her utterances. But in third-person narrative text, sentences can express a character&apos;s beliefs, emotions, etc., even when he or she is referred to in the third person. Thus, an additional deictic component, corresponding to the speaker in conversation, is needed to understand third-person narrative: the psychological point of view (Usp</context>

Even restricting one&apos;s attention to the two classes mentioned above, there are many syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic features according to which one could characterize subjective sentences. Below I propose a view of subjective sentences that is useful for the specific purpose of tracking FOV. For characterizations that include further and alternative distinctions, see, for example, the following works in literary theory and linguistics: Dole2e1 1973; Uspensky 1973; Fillmore 1974; Cohn 1978; Banfield 1982; Caenepeel 1989; Galbraith 1990; Li 1991. A private state is part of the meaning of any kind of subjective sentence. However, a represented thought or represented perception without a narrative parenthetical explicitly mentions only the object of the private state; the attitude and experiencer are implicit. On the other hand, a private-state report explicitly mentions the experiencer, the attitude, and, optionally, the object of a private state p; in addition, with the privatestate report, p is not the object of some other private state with an implici</context>

Rather, (7.2) is Jeff&apos;s thought expressing his goal to avoid notice, and also his belief about how to achieve it. Understanding this is necessary for the reader to perceive the intentionality behind the action described in (7.3). In addition to being important for plan recognition, tracking POV is necessary to distinguish what is true in the fictional world from what is believed by the characters. While objective sentences are unquestionably true in the fictional world, subjective sentences reflect the subjective character&apos;s beliefs, which may be false in the fictional world (Uspensky 1973; Kuroda 1976; Cohn 1978; Banfield 1982). A striking example is the following: (8) This was David&apos;s boy. [Bridgers, All Together Now, p. 911 Sentence (8) is actually about a female character named &amp;quot;Casey.&amp;quot; However, it is the represented thought of a character who believes that Casey is a boy, and reflects this false belief about her. Beliefs and intentions are just two of many types of attitudes communicated by subjective sentences (see Dyer [1983] for a processing model of how various attitudes can be related to goals). The algorithm for tracking POV presented in this paper is intended to be </context>
<context position="22023" citStr="Uspensky (1973)" startWordPosition="3495" endWordPosition="3496">eloping the algorithm. Further, some preliminary empirical tests of the algorithm have been performed (see Section 12), among them psychological experiments of specific aspects of the algorithm. The results of these experiments are positive. I describe them as &amp;quot;preliminary&amp;quot; so as not to suggest that the entire algorithm has already been subjected to psychological experimentation. 5. Previous Work There are literary theorists and linguists who investigate linguistic aspects of subjective sentences. The present work greatly benefited from their investigations, most directly from Dole2e1 (1973), Uspensky (1973), Kuroda (1973, 1976), Fillmore (1974), Cohn (1978), and especially Banfield (1982). However, the relevant work in the above fields is descriptive only; it describes characteristics of subjective sentences, but does not address the problem of tracking POV. An exception is work on POV and aspect that shows that aspect is only a context-sensitive marker of subjectivity (Ehrlich [1987, 19901 and Caenepeel [1989j; see Section 9). In AT, Nakhimovsky (1988) suggests a discourse-processing approach to tracking POV, but does not develop it in any depth. Also, Reiser (1981) simply suggests that POV may</context>

The potential subjective elements form a large class that includes lexical items used with particular meanings, tense, aspect, and certain syntactic properties (see Section 9.2). 2. The type of state of affairs that each clause is about. For example, the main clause of the following is about a private state and the subordinated clause is about an action: John wondered whether Mary opened the door. Note that each of the following is about a private state: Mary was afraid of the dark. The darkness made Mary afraid. Wiebe (1990) gives a list of private-state terms, noting which syntactic roles the experiencer fills in various clause structures (this material is drawn from Quirk et al. [19851). Section 6.3.1 gives the categorization of states of affairs used in this work. 3. An indication of whether or not the head noun of the subject of the main clause is a private-state noun (e.g., &apos;pain&apos; and &apos;astonishment&apos;) and, if it is, the state of affairs that that noun is about. Examples of sentences with such private-state nouns are: (10) The feeling went away. (11) The pain increased. (12) His astonishment grew. 4. The exper</context>

Active characters are based specifically on Sidner&apos;s actor focus, but while Sidner&apos;s actor focus is &amp;quot;whoever is currently the agent in the sentence&amp;quot; (p. 282), many sentences with agents do not have active characters, as we shall see in Section 8.2.2. In some cases, the SC of a subjective sentence is not identifiable when the sentence appears, but may be identifiable after later sentences are processed. The algorithm, as presented in Wiebe (1990), handles one such case. Because of space limitations, however, this aspect of the algorithm is not presented in this paper, but is only briefly described (in Section 8.2.4). Here is a high-level algorithm for identifying the SC (comments are preceded by ,0/01: IDENTIFY-SC (feat ureSet , context) % IDENTIFY-SC(featureSet, context) C Characters; the empty set indicates failure. if IDENTIFY-SC-FROM-THE-SENTENCE (feat ureSet, context) then return IDENTLFY-SC-FROM-THE-SENTENCE (featureset, context) else if LAsT-SC-Is-AN-ExPEcrED-SC (context) and LAST-ACTfVE-CHARACTER-IS-AN-EXPECTED-SC (context) th</context>

In a case such as (16.6), however, it might be possible to do so. That is, a reader might be able to infer who the SC is from clues in the sentence, such as indications of place, or facts that only a certain character knows. This process is not addressed in this work. However, the author could have made identifying the SC easier by using, for example, a narrative parenthetical or private-state report (see Section 8.3); by not including one of these, the author is deliberately demanding some extra work from the reader. The algorithm as presented in Wiebe (1990) can identify the SC after later sentences are processed in the case where a later sentence contains a narrative parenthetical or is a private-state report. As illustrations, (16.7) is a private-state report whose SC, Mona, is the SC of (16.6), and (19.2) is a private-state report whose SC, Pete, is the SC of (19.1). 8.3 Identifying the SC from the Sentence We now turn to cases in which the SC is identifiable from the sentence itself (that is, cases in which IDENTIFY-SC-FROM-THE-SENTENcE(featureSet„ context) 0 {}; see Section 8.1). In these cases, the SC of sentence s is chosen from among cert</context>

Stark (1987, 1988) performed psychological experiments that showed that there is a significant correlation between paragraph breaks and discourse discontinuities, but the sorts of discontinuities she investigated did not include changes in POV. Nakhimovsky and Rapaport (1988) suggest that in narrative, paragraph breaks accompany changes in POV, but they did not investigate this hypothesis experimentally. In fact, we have performed psychological experiments (Bruder and Wiebe 1990 and in press) that did establish such a link. Specifically, through manipulation of paragraph breaks in naturally occurring passages, the experiments showed that readers&apos; interpretations of private-state sentences are influenced by paragraph breaks as we predicted on the basis of the algorithm. 8.3.2 Subjective Elements. Private-state sentences are pragmatically ambiguous as to whether they are private-state reports or represented thoughts.&apos; Consider sentence (21): (21) John knew Mary had the key. Sentence (21) is about a private state: &amp;quot;John knew Mary had the key.&amp;quot; p5 (pi. experienceri, atti</context>

However, with the exception of two of the elements, the perfective and progressive aspects (see below), previous work did not address the problem that many of the elements are only potentially subjective, and can also appear in objective sentences. Further, Wiebe (1990) contains an extensive, detailed catalogue of the potential subjective elements (specified mainly in terms of syntactic and semantic categories presented in Quirk et al. [1985]); such a catalog did not previously exist. Most of the potential subjective elements are lexical. But it is not words and phrases themselves that are potential subjective elements, but rather words and phrases used 257 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 Table 2 Some potential subjective elements. 1 Exclamations, such as (25.1), and direct questions, such as (25.2) 2 Elements that express evaluation or judgeme</context>

For example, &apos;poor&apos; is a potential subjective element only with its evaluative meaning, as in &amp;quot;Poor John was sick,&amp;quot; but not with its nonevaluative meaning, as in &amp;quot;John was poor&amp;quot; (Banfield 1982; the evaluative meaning of &apos;poor&apos; is one of the elements that Banfield argues is always subjective). Tables 2 and 3 list some potential subjective elements, giving very brief characterizations. For further details, see Wiebe (1990). All of the citations in Tables 2 and 3 are with respect to the linguistic categories of the elements. Some of those who discuss the appearance of the elements in subjective sentences are as follows: Banfield (1982) discusses (1), (2.1)—(2.3), (4), (5), and (12); Dolael (1973) discusses (1), (2.1)—(2.3), (5), (6.1), (6.2), and (8); Brinton (1980) discusses (9) (she shows that a simile can be a marker of represented perception) and (12); Ehrlich (1990) discusses (11), and Ehrlich (1987) discusses (12). The past perfective is potentially subjective simply because a character can reflect on what</context>
<context position="91277" citStr="Wiebe 1990" startWordPosition="14525" endWordPosition="14526">n (4). As mentioned in Section 8.2.4, the number of sentences that appear in this situation is relatively small, and, of those that do, many are private-state reports or have narrative parentheticals. It may be that some of the potential subjective elements associated at the highest level with the situations in (30 should also be associated with the one in (40; the appearance of the relevant kind of subjective sentence in this situation was too rare in the texts examined to decide this. Because there are 34 classes of potential subjective elements, the majority of which have multiple members (Wiebe 1990), a significant number of each potential subjective element in each situation was not found. The association of elements with text situations is based on the examples that were found, and, for the ones that did not appear very often in the texts examined, on my judgments as to which of the ones that did appear often are closest to them in strength. Psychological experiments (with Gail Bruder) of this aspect of the algorithm are underway. We plan to revise the association of potential subjective elements with text situations as needed in light of the results. 9.5 Quoted Speech In quoted speech,</context>

The results are positive, and are given in Appendix C. Fully testing the algorithm would require a much larger corpus, in which a significant number of each of the possibilities arises. Such testing would be a major endeavor in itself. Finally, as mentioned in Section 8.3.1, we have performed psychological experiments that showed that readers&apos; interpretations of private-state sentences are affected by paragraph breaks as we predicted on the basis of the algorithm (Bruder and Wiebe 1990 and in press). We are continuing this line of research with psychological experiments of other aspects of the algorithm. 13. Relation to Anaphora Resolution A question likely to arise in the reader&apos;s mind is how tracking POV and anaphora resolution are related. Anaphora resolution is necessary for tracking POV (the actors and experiencers of states of affairs must be known; see item (4) of Section 6.1). But it is certainly not sufficient, arid an additional mechanism is needed. A case that clearly illustrates this is a private-state sentence in which the experiencer is referred to with a pron</context>

Further, by restricting the types of texts considered (see Section 2.2 above), it is possible to constrain the problem to choosing among an objective POV and the points of view of the characters. In genres such as soft news and editorials, for example, the writer may present his or her own attitudes; when attitudes of the writer, the speaker, or a narrator may be presented, the problem is less constrained. Hamburger (1973), Kuroda (1973), Banfield (1982), Galbraith (1990), and Wiebe (1991) address this issue more fully. Finally, there is a great deal of previous work to build upon, in linguistics and especially literary theory investigating POV in novels and short stories. 4. Approach Reasoning about whether a sentence is objective or the subjective sentence of this or that character is certainly part of tracking POV (Fillmore 1974). But it is reasonable to hypothesize that, in the face of all of the inferential possibilities, discourse expectations too are involved in tracking POV; that is, in the absence of an explicit indication of POV, readers are intended to assume that PO</context>
