This research note reports on the work
in progress which regards automatic
transformation of phrase-structure syn-
tactic trees of Arabic into dependency-
-driven analytical ones. Guidelines for
these descriptions have been developed
at the Linguistic Data Consortium, Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, and at the Fac-
ulty of Mathematics and Physics and the
Faculty of Arts, Charles University in
Prague, respectively.
The transformation consists of (i) a re-
cursive function translating the topology
of a phrase tree into a corresponding de-
pendency tree, and (ii) a procedure as-
signing analytical functions to the nodes
of the dependency tree.
Apart from an outline of the annota-
tion schemes and a deeper insight into
these procedures, model application of
the transformation is given herein.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99120688">
Exploring the relationship between constituency
and dependency sentence representations is not a
new issue—the first studies go back to the 60&apos;s
(Gaifman (1965); for more references, see e.g.
Schneider (1998)). Still, some theoretical find-
ings had not been applicable until the first de-
pendency treebanks with well-defined annotation
schemes came into existence just in the very last
years (Haji 6 et al., 2001).
The need to convert Arabic treebank data of
different descriptions arises from a co-operation
between the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC),
University of Pennsylvania, and three concerned
institutions of Charles University in Prague,
namely the Center for Computational Linguistics,
the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics,
and the Institute of Comparative Linguistics.
The two parties intend to share the resources
they create. Prior to this exchange, 10,000 words
from the LDC Arabic Newswire A Corpus were
manually annotated in both syntactic styles as a
step to ensure that the annotations are re-usable
and their concepts mutually compatible. Here we
attempt the constituency–dependency direction of
the transfer.

The input data come from the LDC team
(Maamouri et al., 2003). The annotation scheme is
based on constituent-syntax bracketing style used
at the University of Pennsylvania (Maamouri and
Cieri, 2002). The trees include nodes for surface
text tokens as well as non-terminal nodes follow-
ing from the descriptive grammar. Not only syn-
tactic elements, but also several kinds of structural
reconstructions (traces) are captured here.

Under the analytical tree structure we understand
a representation of the surface sentence in form of
a dependency tree. The node set consists of all the
tokens determined after morphological analysis of
the text, and the sentence root node. The descrip-
tion recovers the relation between a governor and
a node dependent on it. The nature of the govern-
ment is expressed by the analytical functions of
the nodes being linked

1.3 Model sentence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99625924">
Let us give a model sentence which in its phonetic
transcript and translation reads
Wa lam yakun mina &apos;s-sahli calay
hi muwc7kahatu kainirati
wa cadasati 7-musawwirrna wa huwa
ya,scadu 1-bd,sa.
It was not easy for him to face the tele-
vision cameras and the lenses of photog-
raphers as he was getting on the bus.
Its respective representations in Figures 1 and 2
use glossed tokens which are further split into
morphemes and transliterated in Tim Buckwalter&apos;s
notation of graphemes of the Arabic script.
There are three phenomena to focus on in the
trees. Firstly, occurrence of the empty trace
(*TRACE) NP-SBJ or the (*T*TRACE) NP-SBJ-1
one with its contents moved to NP-TPC-1. Sec-
ondly, subtree interpretation may be sensitive to
other than the top-level nodes, like when the coor-
dination S CONJ S produces the subordinate com-
plement clause Pred (Atv) due to the idiomatic
context of the pronoun. Finally to note are com-
plex rearrangements of special constructs, as is the
case of NP-SBJ PP NP-PRD versus AuxP AuxP Sb
nodes and their subtrees. More discussion follows.

<bodyText confidence="0.876938777777778">
The two tree types in question differ in the topol-
ogy as well as in the attributes of the nodes. Thus,
the problem is decomposed into two parts:
i) creation of the dependency tree topology, i.e.
contraction of the phrase-structure tree based
mostly on the concept of phrase heads and on
resolution of traces,
ii) assignment of labels describing the analytical
function of the node within the target tree.

head child of each node in a phrase structure, using
the head percolation table, and (b) in the depen-
dency structure, make the head of each non-head
child depend on the head of the head-child.
In our implementation, the topology of the an-
alytical tree is derived from the topology of the
phrase tree by a recursive function, which has the
following input arguments: original phrase tree
Tphr, dependency tree Tdep being created, one par-
ticular node sph, from Tph, (the root of the phrase
subtree to be processed), and node pdep from Tdep
(the future parent of the subtree being processed).
The function returns the root of the created analyt-
ical subtree. The recursion works like this:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994106">
1. If sph, is a terminal node, then create a sin-
gle analytical node ndep in Tdep and attach it
below pdep; return ndep;
2. Otherwise (sph, is a nonterminal), choose

<bodyText confidence="0.9972755">
the head node hph, among the children of
Sphr, recursively call the function with hph,
as the phrase subtree root argument, and store
its return value rdep (root of the recursively
created dependency subtree); recursively call
the function for each remaining sphr&apos;s child
nphr,i, and attach the returned subtree root
Odep,i below rdep; return rdep.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998574">
2.2 Appointing heads
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9967040625">
Rules for the selection of phrase heads follow
from the analytical annotation guidelines. Pred-
icates are considered the uppermost nodes of a
clause, prepositions govern the rest of a prepo-
sitional phrase, auxiliary words are annotated as
leaves etc. Non-verbal predication, so frequent in
Arabic syntax, is also formalized into the terms of
dependency, cf. Smrsi et al. (2002).
With the algorithm taking decisions about the
head child before scanning the subtrees of the
level, the already mentioned clause huwa yascadu
Thasa qualifies improperly as a sister to the predi-
cate yakun of the main clause. In fact, we are deal-
ing with the so called state or complement clause.
Therefore, corrective shuffling in this respect is in-
evitable.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996374">
2.3 Tree post-processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995975">
Completion of the dependency tree also involves
pruning of subtrees which are co-indexed with
some trace, and attaching them in place of the re-
ferring trace node. Typically, this is the case for
clauses having an explicit subject before the pred-
icate. In the model sentence, yascadu retains its
role as a predicate of the clause, no matter what
function it receives from its governor.

3 Analytical Function Assignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970714285714">
The analytical function can be deduced well from
the POS of the node and the sequence of labels of
all its ancestors in the phrase tree, and from the
POS or the lexical attributes of its parent in the
dependency tree. That is why this step succeeds
the structural changes.
Problems may appear though if the declared
constituents are not consistent enough, relative to
the analytical concept. While NP-SBJ, PP and NP-
PRD would normally imply Sb, AuxP and Pnom,
these get in principal conflict in the type of nom-
inal predicates like mina &apos;s-sahli followed by an
optional object and a rhematic subject. The Fig-
ures provide the best insight into the differences.

4 Evaluation and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975928571429">
Preliminary evaluation gives 60 % accuracy of the
generated tree topology, and roughly the same
rate for analytical function assignment. The mea-
sure is the percentage of correct values of par-
ents/functions among all values. The work is in
progress, however. According to our experience
with similar task for Czech, English (2abokrts14
and Kueerova, 2002) and German, we expect the
performance to improve up to 90 % and 85 % as
more phenomena are treated.
The experience made during this task shall be
useful for the development of a rule-based de-
pendency partial analysis, which shall pre-process
data for manual analytical annotation.
