<bodyText confidence="0.998004466666667">
German case syncretism is often assumed
to be the accidental by-product of historical
development. This paper contradicts this
claim and argues that the evolution of Ger-
man case is driven by the need to optimize
the cognitive effort and memory required
for processing and interpretation. This hy-
pothesis is supported by a novel kind of
computational experiments that reconstruct
and compare attested variations of the Ger-
man definite article paradigm. The exper-
iments show how the intricate interaction
between those variations and the rest of the
German ‘linguistic landscape’ may direct
language change.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99996435">
In his 1880 essay, Mark Twain famously com-
plained that The awful German Language is the
most “slipshod and systemless, and so slippery
and elusive to grasp” language of all. A brief
look at the literature on the German case system
seems to provide sufficient evidence for instantly
agreeing with the American author. But what if
the German case system were not the accidental
by-product of diachronic changes as is often as-
sumed? Are there linguistic forces that are not yet
fully appreciated in the field, but which may ex-
plain the German case paradigm?
This paper demonstrates that there indeed are
such forces through a case study on German def-
inite articles. The experiments ‘reconstruct’ deep
language processing models for different variants
of this paradigm, and show how the ‘linguistic
landscape’ of German has allowed its speakers to
reduce their definite article system without loss in
efficiency for processing and interpretation.

The system is notorious for its syncretism (i.e.
the same form can be mapped onto different func-
tions), a riddle that has fascinated many formal
and historical linguists looking for explanations.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986937">
2.1 Historical Linguistics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99732025">
Studies in historical linguistics and grammatical-
ization often propose the following three forces to
explain syncretism (Heine and Kuteva, 2005, p.
148):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988391666666667">
1. The formal distinction between case markers
is lost through phonological changes.
2. One case takes over the functional domain of
another case and replaces it.
3. A case marker disappears and its functions
are usurped by another marker.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999615">
Syncretism is thus considered as the accidental
by-product of such forces, and German case syn-
cretism is typically analyzed according to these
lines (Barðdal, 2009; Baerman, 2009, p. 229).
However, these forces are not explanatory: they
only describe what has happened, but not why.

<bodyText confidence="0.999702625">
Another problem for the ‘syncretism by acci-
dent’ hypothesis is the fact that the collapsing of
case forms is not randomly distributed over the
whole paradigm as would be expected. Hawkins
(2004, p. 78) observes that instead there is a sys-
tematic tendency for ‘lower’ cells in the paradigm
(e.g. genitive; Table 1) to collapse before cells in
‘higher’ positions (e.g. nominative) do so.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985662">
2.2 Formal Linguistics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982558823529">
Many hidden effects of verbal linguistic theo-
ries can be uncovered through explicit formaliza-
tions. Unfortunately, formal linguists also typi-
cally distinguish between ‘systematic’ and ‘non-
systematic’ syncretism when analyzing German
case. For instance, in his review of a number of
studies on German (a.o. Bierwisch, 1967; Blevins,
1995; Wiese, 1996; Wunderlich, 1997), Müller
(2002) concludes that none of these approaches
is able to rule out accidental syncretism.
There is however one major stone that has been
left unturned by formal linguists: processing.
Most formal theories, such as HPSG (Ginzburg
and Sag, 2000), assume a strict division between
‘competence’ and ‘performance’ and therefore
represent linguistic knowledge in a purely declar-
ative, process-independent way (Sag and Wasow,
2011). While such an approach may be desirable
from a ‘mathematical’ point of view, it puts the
burden of efficient processing on the shoulders
of computational linguists, who have to develop
more intelligent interpreters.
One example of the gap between description
and computational implementation is disjunctive
feature representation, which became popular in
feature-based grammar formalisms in the 1980s
(Karttunen, 1984). Disjunctions allow an elegant
notation for multiple feature values, as illustrated
in example 1 for the German definite article die,
which is either assigned nominative or accusative
case, and which is either feminine-singular or plu-
ral. The feature structure (adopted from Kart-
tunen, 1984, p. 30) represents disjunctions by en-
closing the alternatives in curly brackets ({ }).

However, it is a well-established fact that dis-
junctions are computationally expensive, which
is illustrated in the top of Figure 1. This Fig-
ure shows the search tree of a small grammar
when parsing the utterance Die Kinder gaben der
Lehrerin die Zeichnung (‘the children gave the
drawing to the (female) teacher’), which is un-
ambiguous to German speakers. As can be seen
in the Figure, the search tree has to explore sev-
eral branches before arriving at a valid solution.
Most of the splits are caused by disjunctions. For
example, when a determiner-noun construction
specifies that the case features of the definite ar-
ticle die (nominative or accusative) and the noun
Kinder (‘children’; nominative, accusative or gen-
itive) have to unify, the search tree splits into two
hypotheses (a nominative and an accusative read-
ing) even though for native speakers of German,
the syntactic context unambiguously points to a
nominative reading (because it is the only noun
phrase that agrees with the main verb).
It should be no surprise, then, that a lot of work
has focused on processing disjunctions more ef-
ficiently (e.g. Carter, 1990; Ramsay, 1990). As
observed by Flickinger (2000), however, most of
these studies implicitly assume that the grammar
representation has to remain unchanged. He then
demonstrates through computational experiments
how a different representation can directly impact
efficiency, and argues that revisions of the gram-
mar for efficiency should be discussed more thor-
oughly in the literature.
The impact of representation on processing is
illustrated at the bottom of Figure 1, which shows
the performance of a grammar that uses the same
processing technique for handling the same utter-
ance, but a different representation than the dis-
junctive grammar. As can be seen, the alternative
grammar (whose technical details are disclosed
further below) is able to parse the German defi-
nite articles without tears, and the resulting search
tree arguably better reflects the actual processing
performed by native speakers of German.

ing data. All experiments reported in this paper
have therefore been implemented in Fluid Con-
struction Grammar (FCG; Steels, 2011, 2012a), a
unification-based grammar formalism that comes
equipped with an interactive web interface and
monitoring tools (Loetzsch, 2012). A second ad-
vantage of FCG is that it features strong bidirec-
tionality: the FCG-interpreter can achieve both
parsing and production using the same linguistic
inventory. Other feature structure platforms, such
as the lkb-system (Copestake, 2002), require a
separate parser and generator for formalizing bidi-
rectional grammars, which make them less suited
for substantiating the claims of this paper.

3.1 Distinctive Feature Matrix
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992083333333">
German case has become the litmus test for
demonstrating how well a feature-based grammar
formalism copes with multifunctionality, espe-
cially since Ingria (1990) provocatively stated that
unification is not the best technique for handling
it. People have gone to great lengths to counter
Ingria’s claim, especially within the HPSG frame-
work (e.g. Müller, 1999; Daniels, 2001; Sag,
2003), and various formalizations have been of-
fered for German case (Heinz and Matiasek,
1994; Müller, 2001; Crysmann, 2005). However,
these proposals either do not succeed in avoiding
inefficient disjunctions or they require a complex
double type hierarchy (Crysmann, 2005).
The experiments in this paper use a more
straightforward solution, called a distinctive fea-
ture matrix, which is based on an idea that was
first explored by Ingria (1990) and of which a
variation has recently also been proposed for
Lexical Functional Grammar (Dalrymple et al.,
2009). Instead of treating case as a single-valued
feature, it can be represented as an array of fea-
tures, as shown for the definite article die (ignor-
ing the genitive case for the time being):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8577902">
⎡(2) die: ⎡ ⎤ ⎤
⎢ ⎢ ⎣ nom ?nom
⎢ ⎥ ⎥
CASE ⎣acc ?acc ⎦ ⎦ ⎥
dat –
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997415">
The case feature includes a paradigm of three
cases (nom, acc and dat), whose values can ei-
ther be ‘+’ or ‘–’, or left unspecified through a
variable (indicated by a question mark). The two
variables ?nom and ?acc indicate that die can
potentially be assigned nominative or accusative
case, the value ‘–’ for dative means that die can-
not be assigned dative case. We can do the same
for Kinder (‘children’), which can be nominative
or accusative, but not dative:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9444842">
⎡ ⎤ ⎤
nom ?nom
⎢ ⎥ ⎥
CASE ⎣acc ?acc ⎦ ⎦ ⎥
dat –
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977625">
As demonstrated in Figure 1, disjunctive fea-
ture representation would cause a split in the
search tree when unifying die and Kinder. Us-
ing a feature matrix, however, the choice between
a nominative and accusative reading can simply
be postponed until enough information from the
rest of the utterance is available. Unifying die and
Kinder yields the following feature structure:

3.2 A Three-Dimensional Matrix
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997204">
The German case paradigm is obviously more
complex than the examples shown so far. Let’s
consider Table 1 again, but this time we replace
every cell in the table by a variable. This leads to
the following feature matrix for the German defi-
nite articles:

<table confidence="0.9997064">

Table 2: A distinctive feature matrix for German case.

<bodyText confidence="0.999681428571429">
Each cell in this matrix represents a specific
feature bundle that collects the features case,
number, and person. For example, the variable
?n-s-m stands for nominative singular mascu-
line. Note that also the cases themselves have
their own variable (?nom, ?acc, ?dat and
?gen). This allows us to single out a specific di-
mension of the matrix for constructions that only
care about case distinctions, but abstract away
from gender or number. Each linguistic item fills
in as much information as possible in this case
matrix. For example, Table 3 shows how the def-
inite article die underspecifies its potential values
and rules out all other options through ‘–’.

4.1 Three Paradigms

The experiments compare three different variants
of the German definite article paradigm.
Standard German. The Standard German
paradigm has been illustrated in Table 1 and its
operationalization has been shown in section 3.2.
The paradigm has been inherited without signifi-
cant changes from Middle High German (1050-
1350; Walshe, 1974) and features six different
forms.
Old High German. The Old High German
paradigm is the direct predecessor of the current
paradigm of definite articles. It contained at least
twelve distinct forms (depending on which varia-
tion is taken) that included gender distinctions in
plural (Wright, 1906, p. 67). It also included one
definite article that marked the now extinct instru-
mental case, which is ignored in this paper. The
variant of the Old High German paradigm that has
been implemented in the experiments is summa-
rized in Table 6.

Argument structure constructions (Goldberg,
2006), such as the ditransitive, can then later as-
sign either nominative or accusative case. The
main advantage of feature matrices is that linguis-
tic search only has to commit to specific feature-
values once sufficient information is available, so
the search tree only splits when there is an actual
ambiguity. Moreover, they can be handled using
standard unification. Interested readers can con-
sult van Trijp (2011) for a thorough description of
the approach, as well as a discussion on how the
FCG implementation differs from Ingria (1990)

Texas German. The third variant is an
American-German dialect called Texas German
(Boas, 2009a,b), which evolved a two-way case
distinction between nominative and oblique. This
type of case system, in which the accusative and

evolution in the Low German dialects (Shrier,

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984625">
Each grammar is tested as to how efficiently it can
produce and parse utterances in terms of cognitive
effort and search (see section 4.3). There are three
basic types of utterances:

whose head nouns always have a distinct form
for singular and plural (e.g. Mann vs. Män-
ner; ‘man’ vs. ‘men’), but that are unmarked for
case. The combinations of arguments is always
unique along the dimensions of number and gen-
der, which yields 216 unique utterance types for

etc.
In transitive utterances, there is an additional
distinction based on animacy for noun phrases in
the Object position of the utterance, which yields
72 types in the NOM-ACC configuration and 72
in the NOM-DAT configuration. Together, there
are 360 unique utterance types. As can be gleaned
from the utterance types, the genitive case is not
considered by the experiments, as the genitive is
not part of basic German argument structures and
it has almost disappeared in most dialects of Ger-
man (Shrier, 1965).
In production, the grammar is presented with a
meaning that needs to be verbalized into an utter-
ance. In parsing, the produced utterance has to be
analyzed back into a meaning. Every utterance is
processed using a full search, that is, all branches
and solutions are calculated.
The experiments exploit types because there
are three different language systems, hence it is
impossible to use a single, real corpus and its to-
ken frequencies. It would also be unwarranted to
use different corpora because corpus-specific bi-
ases would distort the comparative results. Sec-
ondly, as the experiments involve models of deep
language processing (as opposed to stochastic
models), the use of types instead of tokens is
justified in this phase of the research: the first
concern of precision-grammars is descriptive ade-
quacy, for which types are a more reliable source.
Obviously, the effect of token frequency needs to
be examined in future research.

4.3 Measuring Cognitive Effort
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986071428572">
The experiments measure two kinds of cognitive
effort: syntactic search and semantic ambiguity.
Search. The search measure counts the number
of branches in the search process that reach an end
node, which can either be a possible solution or
a dead end (i.e. no constructions can be applied
anymore). Duplicate nodes (for instance, nodes
that use the same rules but in a different order)
are not counted. The search measure is then used
as a ‘sanity check’ to verify whether the three dif-
ferent paradigms can be processed with the same
efficiency in terms of search tree length, as hy-
pothesized by this paper. More specifically, the
following conditions have to be met:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9672995">
1. In production, there should only be one
branch.
2. In parsing, search has to be equal to the se-
mantic effort.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999733642857143">
The single branch constraint in production
checks whether the definite articles are suffi-
ciently distinct from one another. Since there is no
ambiguity about which argument plays which role
in the utterance, the grammar should only come
up with one solution. In parsing, the number of
branches has to correspond to ‘real’ semantic am-
biguities and not create additional search, as ar-
gued in section 2.2.
Semantic Ambiguity. Semantic ambiguity
equals the number of possible interpretations
of an utterance. For instance, the utterance
Der Hund beißt den Mann ‘the dog bites the
man’ is unambiguous in Modern High German,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99649">
834
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981825">
since der Hund can only be nominative singular-
masculine, and den Mann can only be accusative
masculine-singular. There is thus only one pos-
sible interpretation in which the dog is the biter
and the man is being bitten, illustrated as follows
using a logic-based meaning representation (also
see Steels, 2004, for this operationalization of
cognitive effort):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.627377">
(6) Interpretation 1:
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.7554108">
Der Hund bei§t den Mann.
dog(?a) bite(?ev) man(?b)
biter(?ev, ?x)
?a=?x bitten(?ev, ?y)
?b=?y
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99012975">
However, an utterance such as die Katze beißt
die Frau ‘the cat bites the woman’ is ambiguous
because die has both a nominative and accusative
singular-feminine reading:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.56105125">
(7) a. Interpretation 1:
Die Katze bei§t die Frau.
cat(?a) bite(?ev) woman(?b)
biter(?ev, ?x)

?b=?y
b. Interpretation 2:
Die Katze bei§t die Frau.
cat(?a) bite(?ev) woman(?b)
biter(?ev, ?x)
bitten(?ev, ?y)
?a=?y
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997895">
Here, German speakers are likely to use word
order, intonation and world knowledge (i.e. cats
are more likely to bite a person than the other way
round) for disambiguating the utterance.

4.4 Experimental Parameters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990538461538">
The experiments (E1-E4) concern the cue-
reliability of the definite articles for disambiguat-
ing event structure. In all experiments, the differ-
ent grammars can exploit the case-number-gender
information of definite articles, and also the gen-
der and number specifications of nouns, and the
syntactic valence of verbs. For instance, the
noun form Frauen ‘women’ is specified as plural-
feminine, and verbs like helfen ‘to help’ are spec-
ified to take a dative object, whereas verbs like
finden ‘to find’ take an accusative object. In other
experiments, different combinations of grammat-
ical cues become available or not:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.678704">
Cue E1 E2 E3 E4
SV-agreement + +
Selection restrictions + +
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998462333333333">
SV-agreement restricts the subject to singular
or plural nouns, and semantic selection restric-
tions can disambiguate utterances in which for ex-
ample the Agent-role has to be animate (e.g. in
perception verbs such as sehen ‘to see’). All other
possible cues, such as word order, are ignored.

5.1 Search
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966">
In all experiments, the constraints of the search
measure were satisfied: every grammar only re-
quired one branch per utterance in production,
and the number of branches in parsing never ex-
ceeded the number of possible interpretations. In
terms of search length, more syncretism therefore
does not automatically harm efficiency, provided
that the grammar uses an adequate representation.
Arguably, the smaller paradigms are even more
efficient because they require less unifications to
be performed.

5.2 Semantic Ambiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.949715260869565">
Now that it has been ascertained that more
syncretism does not harm processing efficiency,
we can compare cue-reliability of the different
paradigms for semantic interpretation.
Ambiguous Utterances. Figure 2 shows the
number of ambiguous utterances in parsing (in %)
per paradigm and per set-up. As can be seen,
the Old High German paradigm (black) is the
most reliable cue in Experiment 1 (E1; when SV-
agreement and selection restrictions are ignored)
with 35.56% of ambiguous utterances, as opposed
to 55.56% for Modern High German (grey) and
77.78% for Texas German (white).
When SV-agreement is taken into account (E2),
the difference between Old and Modern High
German becomes smaller, with both paradigms
offering a reliability of more than 70%, while
Texas German still faces more than 70% of am-
biguous utterances.
Ambiguity is even more reduced when using
semantic selection restrictions of the verb (set-up
?a=?x
?b=?x

E3). Here, the difference between Old and Mod-
ern High German becomes trivial with 4.44% and
6.94% of ambiguous utterances respectively. The
difference with Texas German remains apparent,
even though its ambiguity is cut by half.
In set-up E4 (case, SV-agreement and selection
restrictions), the Old and Modern High German
paradigms resolve almost all ambiguities, leaving
little difference between them. Using the Texas
German dialect, one utterance out of five remains
ambiguous and requires additional grammatical
cues or inferencing for semantic interpretation.
Number of possible interpretations. Semantic
ambiguity can also be measured by counting the
number of possible interpretations per utterance.
A non-ambiguous language would thus have 1
possible interpretation per utterance. The aver-
age number of interpretations per utterance (per
paradigm and per set-up) is shown in Table 8.

The Old High German paradigm has the least
semantic ambiguity throughout, except in Exper-
iment 1 (E1). Here, Modern High German has
the same average effort despite having more am-
biguous utterances. This means that the Old High
German paradigm provides a better coverage in
terms of construction types, but when ambiguity
occurs, more possible interpretations exist.

6 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989415625">
The experiments compare how well three differ-
ent paradigms of definite articles perform if they
are inserted in the grammar of Modern High Ger-
man. The results show that, in isolation, Old High
German offers the best cue-reliability for retriev-
ing who’s doing what to whom in events. How-
ever, when other grammatical cues are taken into
account, it turns out that Modern High German
achieves similar results with respect to syntactic
search and semantic ambiguity, with a reduced
paradigm (using only six instead of twelve forms).
As for the Texas German dialect, which has
collapsed the accusative-dative distinction, the
amount of ambiguity remains more than 20% us-
ing all available cues. One verifiable predic-
tion of the experiments is therefore that this di-
alect should show an increase in alternative syn-
tactic restrictions (such as word order) in order
to make up for the lost case distinctions. Inter-
estingly, such alternatives have been attested in
Low German dialects that have evolved a simi-
lar two-way case system (Shrier, 1965). Modern
High German, on the other hand, has already re-
cruited word order for other purposes (such as in-
formation structure; Lenerz, 1977; Micelli, 2012),
which may explain why the current paradigm has
been able to survive since the Middle Ages.
Instead of an accidental by-product of phono-
logical and morphological changes, then, a new
picture emerges for explaining syncretism in
Modern High German definite articles: German
speakers have been able to reduce their case
paradigm without loss in processing and interpre-
tation efficiency. With cognitive effort as a selec-
tion criterion, subsequent generations of speakers
found no linguistic pressures for maintaining par-
ticular distinctions such as gender in plural arti-
cles. Especially forms whose acoustic distinctions
are harder to perceive are candidates for collapse
if they are no longer functional for processing or
interpretation. Other factors, such as frequency,
may accelerate this evolution, as also argued by
Barðdal (2009). For instance, there may be less
benefits for upholding a case distinction for infre-
quent than for frequent forms.
If case syncretism is not randomly distributed
over a grammatical paradigm, but rather func-
tionally motivated, a new explanatory model is
needed. One candidate is evolutionary linguistics
(Steels, 2012b), a framework of cultural evolu-
tion in which populations of language users con-
stantly shape and reshape their language in re-
sponse to their communicative needs. The ex-
periments reported here suggest that this dynamic
shaping process is guided by the ‘linguistic land-
scape’ of a language. For instance, the pres-
ence of grammatical cues such as gender, num-
ber and SV-agreement may encourage paradigm
reduction. However, reduction may be the start
of a self-enforcing loop in which the decreasing
cue-reliability of a paradigm may pressure lan-
guage users into enforcing the alternatives to take
on even more of the cognitive load of processing.

cal systems also requires more sophisticated mea-
sures. A promising extension of this paper could
lie in an information-theoretic approach to lan-
guage (Hale, 2003; Jaeger and Tily, 2011), which
has recently explored a set of tools for assessing
linguistic complexity, processing effort and un-
certainty. Unfortunately, only little work has been
done on morphological paradigms so far (see e.g.
Ackerman et al., 2011), and the approach is typi-
cally applied in stochastic or Probabilistic Context
Free Grammars, hence it remains unclear how the
assumptions of this field fit into models of deep
language processing.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991166666666">
More than 130 years after Mark Twain’s com-
plaints, it seems that the German language is not
that awful after all. Through a series of compu-
tational experiments, this paper has proposed a
different explanation for German case syncretism
that answers some of the unsolved riddles of pre-
vious studies. First, the experiments have shown
that an increase in syncretism does not necessar-
ily lead to an increase in the cognitive effort re-
quired for syntactic search, provided that the rep-
resentation of the grammar is processing-friendly.
Secondly, by comparing cue-reliability of differ-
ent paradigms for semantic disambiguation, the
experiments have demonstrated that Modern High
German achieves a similar performance as its Old
High German predecessor using only half of the
forms in its definite article paradigm.
Instead of a series of historical accidents, the
German case system thus underwent a systematic
and “performance-driven [...] morphological re-
structuring” (Hawkins, 2004, p. 79), in which lin-
guistic pressures such as cognitive effort decided
on the maintenance or loss of certain distinctions.
The case study makes clear that formal and com-
putational models of deep language understand-
ing have to reconsider their strict division between
competence and performance if the goal is to ex-
plain individual language development. This pa-
per proposed that new tools and methodologies
should be sought in evolutionary linguistics.

With cognitive effort as a selection criterion, subsequent generations of speakers found no linguistic pressures for maintaining particular distinctions such as gender in plural articles. Especially forms whose acoustic distinctions are harder to perceive are candidates for collapse if they are no longer functional for processing or interpretation. Other factors, such as frequency, may accelerate this evolution, as also argued by Barðdal (2009). For instance, there may be less benefits for upholding a case distinction for infrequent than for frequent forms. If case syncretism is not randomly distributed over a grammatical paradigm, but rather functionally motivated, a new explanatory model is needed. One candidate is evolutionary linguistics (Steels, 2012b), a framework of cultural evolution in which populations of language users constantly shape and reshape their language in response to their communicative needs. The experiments reported here suggest that this dynamic shaping process is guided by the ‘linguistic landscape’ of a lan</context>

For example, when a determiner-noun construction specifies that the case features of the definite article die (nominative or accusative) and the noun Kinder (‘children’; nominative, accusative or genitive) have to unify, the search tree splits into two hypotheses (a nominative and an accusative reading) even though for native speakers of German, the syntactic context unambiguously points to a nominative reading (because it is the only noun phrase that agrees with the main verb). It should be no surprise, then, that a lot of work has focused on processing disjunctions more efficiently (e.g. Carter, 1990; Ramsay, 1990). As observed by Flickinger (2000), however, most of these studies implicitly assume that the grammar representation has to remain unchanged. He then demonstrates through computational experiments how a different representation can directly impact efficiency, and argues that revisions of the grammar for efficiency should be discussed more thoroughly in the literature. The impact of representation on processing is illustrated at the bottom of Figure 1, which shows the performance of a grammar that uses the same processing technique for handling the same utterance, but a different</context>

A second advantage of FCG is that it features strong bidirectionality: the FCG-interpreter can achieve both parsing and production using the same linguistic inventory.

The impact of representation on processing is illustrated at the bottom of Figure 1, which shows the performance of a grammar that uses the same processing technique for handling the same utterance, but a different representation than the disjunctive grammar.

Secondly, by comparing cue-reliability of different paradigms for semantic disambiguation, the experiments have demonstrated that Modern High German achieves a similar performance as its Old High German predecessor using only half of the forms in its definite article paradigm. Instead of a series of historical accidents, the German case system thus underwent a systematic and “performance-driven [...] morphological restructuring” (Hawkins, 2004, p. 79), in which linguistic pressures such as cognitive effort decided on the maintenance or loss of certain distinctions. The case study makes clear that formal and computational models of deep language understanding have to reconsider their strict division between competence and performance if the goal is to explain individual language development. This paper proposed that new tools and methodologies should be sought in evolutionary linguistics. Acknowledgements This research has been conducted at the Sony Computer Science Laboratory Paris.

The system is notorious for its syncretism (i.e. the same form can be mapped onto different functions), a riddle that has fascinated many formal and historical linguists looking for explanations. 2.1 Historical Linguistics Studies in historical linguistics and grammaticalization often propose the following three forces to explain syncretism (Heine and Kuteva, 2005, p. 148): 1. The formal distinction between case markers is lost through phonological changes. 2. One case takes over the functional domain of another case and replaces it. 3. A case marker disappears and its functions are usurped by another marker. Syncretism is thus considered as the accidental by-product of such forces, and German case syncretism is typically analyzed according to these lines (Barðdal, 2009; Baerman, 2009, p. 229).

It should be no surprise, then, that a lot of work has focused on processing disjunctions more efficiently (e.g. Carter, 1990; Ramsay, 1990). As observed by Flickinger (2000), however, most of these studies implicitly assume that the grammar representation has to remain unchanged. He then demonstrates through computational experiments how a different representation can directly impact efficiency, and argues that revisions of the grammar for efficiency should be discussed more thoroughly in the literature.

(2009). GEN dëro dëro dëro Table 6: The Old High German definite article system. Texas German. The third variant is an American-German dialect called Texas German (Boas, 2009a,b), which evolved a two-way case distinction between nominative and oblique. This type of case system, in which the accusative and dative case have collapsed, is also a common evolution in the Low German dialects (Shrier, 1965). The implemented paradigm of Texas German is shown in Table 7. 833 Case SG-M SG-F SG-N PL NOM der die das die ACC/DAT den die den die Table 7: The Texas German definite article system. 4.2 Production and Parsing Tasks Each grammar is tested as to how efficiently it can produce and parse utterances in terms of cognitive effort and search (see section 4.3). There are three basic types of utterances: 1. Ditransitive: NOM – Verb – DAT – ACC 2. Transitive (a): NOM – Verb – ACC 3. Transitive (b): NOM – Verb – DAT The argument roles are filled by noun phrases whose head nouns always have a distinct </context>

Together, there are 360 unique utterance types. As can be gleaned from the utterance types, the genitive case is not considered by the experiments, as the genitive is not part of basic German argument structures and it has almost disappeared in most dialects of German (Shrier, 1965). In production, the grammar is presented with a meaning that needs to be verbalized into an utterance. In parsing, the produced utterance has to be analyzed back into a meaning. Every utterance is processed using a full search, that is, all branches and solutions are calculated. The experiments exploit types because there are three different language systems, hence it is impossible to use a single, real corpus and its token frequencies. It would also be unwarranted to use different corpora because corpus-specific biases would distort the comparative results. Secondly, as the experiments invol</context>

As for the Texas German dialect, which has collapsed the accusative-dative distinction, the amount of ambiguity remains more than 20% using all available cues. One verifiable prediction of the experiments is therefore that this dialect should show an increase in alternative syntactic restrictions (such as word order) in order to make up for the lost case distinctions. Interestingly, such alternatives have been attested in Low German dialects that have evolved a similar two-way case system (Shrier, 1965). Modern High German, on the other hand, has already recruited word order for other purposes (such as information structure; Lenerz, 1977; Micelli, 2012), which may explain why the current paradigm has been able to survive since the Middle Ages. Instead of an accidental by-product of phonological and morphological changes, then, a new picture emerges for explaining syncretism in Modern High German definite articles: German speakers have been able to reduce their case paradigm without loss in processing and interpretation efficiency. With cognitive effort as a selection criterion, subsequent ge</context>

Semantic Ambiguity. Semantic ambiguity equals the number of possible interpretations of an utterance. For instance, the utterance Der Hund beißt den Mann ‘the dog bites the man’ is unambiguous in Modern High German, 834 since der Hund can only be nominative singularmasculine, and den Mann can only be accusative masculine-singular. There is thus only one possible interpretation in which the dog is the biter and the man is being bitten, illustrated as follows using a logic-based meaning representation (also see Steels, 2004, for this operationalization of cognitive effort): (6) Interpretation 1: Der Hund bei§t den Mann. dog(?a) bite(?ev) man(?b) biter(?ev, ?x) ?a=?x bitten(?ev, ?y) ?b=?y However, an utterance such as die Katze beißt die Frau ‘the cat bites the woman’ is ambiguous because die has both a nominative and accusative singular-feminine reading: (7) a. Interpretation 1: Die Katze bei§t die Frau. cat(?a) bite(?ev) woman(?b) biter(?ev, ?x) bitten(?ev, ?y) ?b=?y b.

Especially forms whose acoustic distinctions are harder to perceive are candidates for collapse if they are no longer functional for processing or interpretation. Other factors, such as frequency, may accelerate this evolution, as also argued by Barðdal (2009). For instance, there may be less benefits for upholding a case distinction for infrequent than for frequent forms. If case syncretism is not randomly distributed over a grammatical paradigm, but rather functionally motivated, a new explanatory model is needed. One candidate is evolutionary linguistics (Steels, 2012b), a framework of cultural evolution in which populations of language users constantly shape and reshape their language in response to their communicative needs. The experiments reported here suggest that this dynamic shaping process is guided by the ‘linguistic landscape’ of a language. For instance, the presence of grammatical cues such as gender, number and SV-agreement may encourage paradigm reduction. However, reduction may be the start of a self-enforcing loop in which the decreasing cue-reliability of a paradigm may pressure language users into enforcing the alternatives to take on eve</context>

Unfortunately, formal linguists also typically distinguish between ‘systematic’ and ‘nonsystematic’ syncretism when analyzing German case. For instance, in his review of a number of studies on German (a.o. Bierwisch, 1967; Blevins, 1995; Wiese, 1996; Wunderlich, 1997), Müller (2002) concludes that none of these approaches is able to rule out accidental syncretism.
