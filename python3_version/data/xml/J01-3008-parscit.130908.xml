Levinson&apos;s book presents a theory of generalized conversational implicature (GCI), and
makes the central claim that this theory necessitates a &amp;quot;new view of the architecture of
the theory of meaning&amp;quot; (p. 9). Levinson claims that to account for GCI (and other types
of presumptive meanings, or preferred interpretations), it is necessary to distinguish
a new level of utterance-type meaning from sentence-meaning and speaker-meaning:
&amp;quot;This level is to capture the suggestions that the use of an expression of a certain type
generally or normally carries, by default&amp;quot; (p. 71). The book belongs to the genre of
linguistic argumentation. Expanding upon the Gricean notion of GCI (Grice 1975), the
author provides numerous examples of GCI and classifies them into three categories,
each category representing a different licensing heuristic. Then he discusses the im-
plications of the theory: first, for the interface between semantics and pragmatics, and
second, for syntactic theory. Throughout the presentation, the author addresses in great
detail potential objections and counterarguments from alternative theories of meaning.
According to the author, GCIs are defeasible inferences triggered by the speaker&apos;s
choice of utterance form and lexical items because of three heuristics mutually assumed
by speaker and hearer. The heuristics, which can be related to Grice&apos;s maxims, are
these:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.949557">
• The First (Q) Heuristic: &amp;quot;What isn&apos;t said, isn&apos;t.&amp;quot; For example, in the
context of a blocks world where there are salient oppositions of objects
{cones, pyramids, cubes} and colors {red, blue}, from the assertion
&amp;quot;There&apos;s a blue pyramid on the red cube&amp;quot;, this heuristic triggers the
following inferences: &apos;There is not a cone on the red cube&apos;; &apos;There is not a
red pyramid on the red cube&apos; (p. 31).
• The Second (I) Heuristic: &amp;quot;What is simply described is stereotypically
exemplified.&amp;quot; For example, from the assertion &amp;quot;The blue pyramid is on
the red cube,&amp;quot; in the context described above one is licensed to infer
&apos;The pyramid is a stereotypical one ...,&apos;&apos;The pyramid is directly
supported by the cube ... ,&apos; etc. (p. 32).
• The Third (M) Heuristic: &amp;quot;What&apos;s said in an abnormal way, isn&apos;t normal;
or Marked message indicates marked situation.&amp;quot; For example, from the
assertion &amp;quot;The blue cuboid block is supported by the red cube,&amp;quot; in the
context described above one is licensed to infer &apos;The blue block is not,
strictly, a cube,&apos; The blue block is not directly or centrally or stably
supported by the red cube,&apos; etc. (p. 33).

In addition, the theory provides a refinement to Gazdar&apos;s (1979) projection mechanism;
GCIs licensed by Heuristic 1 are preferred to those licensed by Heuristic 3, which in
turn are preferred to those licensed by Heuristic 2.
The book argues against the traditional view of the roles of semantics and prag-
matics, according to which the output of semantics is the input to pragmatics. Instead,
it argues for a more complex relationship in which GCI can play a role in truth condi-
tions. In this model, two distinct types of semantic processes and two distinct types of
pragmatic processes are involved. First, the semantic representation derived from the
syntactic structure and lexical items of a sentence may be underspecified. The output
of this semantic process is the input to a pragmatic process (&amp;quot;Gricean pragmatics I&amp;quot;),
in which default, defeasible pragmatic inferences such as GCIs may contribute to de-
termining the proposition expressed, for example, by helping to disambiguate lexical
ambiguity, &amp;quot;generality narrowing&amp;quot; (i.e., narrowing word sense), and determining ref-
erence. The output of this process is the input to model-theoretic semantics. After
sentence meaning has been determined by this semantic process, another pragmatic
process (&amp;quot;Gricean pragmatics II&amp;quot;) is responsible for deriving other inferences such as
particularized conversational implicatures; this final process yields speaker meaning.
Certainly, the debate on the role of pragmatics in the linguistic &amp;quot;architecture&amp;quot; is
of significance to computational linguistics. In addition, the book provides a wealth
of descriptive information on GCI as well as many pointers to related work in theo-
retical linguistics. However, unfortunately, the book lacks a computational or formal
orientation. For example, much theoretical work would remain to build a computa-
tional model of GCI based just upon the information presented in the book. Also, its
coverage of potentially relevant work in computational linguistics is not up to date;
for example, there is no discussion of recent lexical-pragmatics-oriented approaches
such as those of Di Eugenio and Webber (1996), Elhadad, McKeown, and Robin (1997),
and Stone and Webber (1998). Despite these limitations, this book will be of interest
to language researchers, computationally-oriented or not, with an interest in theories
of meaning.
