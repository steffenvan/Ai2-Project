1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977666666667">
In order to train personnel more effectively, the US military
is developing large-scale distributed simulation capabilities.
Begun as SIMNET in the 1980&apos;s [23], these distributed,
interactive environments attempt to provide a high degree of
fidelity in simulating combat, including simulations of the
individual combatants, the equipment, entity movements,
atmospheric effects, etc. There are four general phases of
user interaction with these simulations: Creating entities,
supplying their initial behavior, interacting with the entities
during a running simulation, and reviewing the results. The
present research concentrates on the first two of these
stages.
Our contribution to the distributed interactive simulation
(DIS) effort is to rethink the nature of the user interaction.
As with most modern simulators, DISs are controlled via
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, the simulation
GUI is showing signs of strain, since even for a small-scale
scenario, it requires users to choose from hundreds of
entities in order to select the desired ones to place on a map.
To compound these interface problems, the military is
intending to increase the scale of the simulations

dramatically, while at the same time, for reasons of
mobility and affordability, desiring that simulations should
be creatable from small devices (e.g., PDAs). This
impending collision of trends for smaller screen size and for
more entities requires a different paradigm for human-
computer interaction.
We have argued generically that GUI technologies offer
advantages in allowing users to manipulate objects that are
on the screen, in reminding users of their options, and in
minimizing errors [7]. However, GUIs are often weak in
supporting interactions with many objects, or objects not
on the screen. In contrast, it was argued that linguistically-
based interface technologies offer the potential to describe
large sets of objects, which may not all be present on a
screen, and can be used to create more complex behaviors
through specification of rule invocation conditions.
Simulation is one type of application for which these
limitations of GUIs, as well as the strengths of natural
language, especially spoken language, are apparent [6].
It has become clear, however, that speech-only interaction is
not optimal for spatial tasks. Using a high-fidelity
&amp;quot;Wizard-of-Oz&amp;quot; methodology [20], recent empirical results
demonstrate clear language processing and task performance
advantages for multimodal (pen/voice) input over speech-
only input for map-based systems [17,18].

<bodyText confidence="0.97476675">
To address these simulation interface problems, and
motivated by the above results, we have developed
QuickSet (see Figure 1) a collaborative, handheld,
multimodal system for configuring military simulations
based on LeatherNet [5], a system used in training platoon
leaders and company commanders at the USMC base at 29
Palms, California. LeatherNet simulations are created using
the ModSAF simulator [10] and can be visualized in a
CAVE-based virtual reality environment [11, 26] called
CommandVu (see Figure 2 — QuickSet systems are on
the soldiers&apos; tables). In addition to LeatherNet, QuickSet is
being used in a second effort called ExInit (Exercise

Initialization), that will enable users to create division-sized
exercises. Because of the use of OAA, QuickSet can
interoperate with agents from CommandTalk [14], which
provides a speech-only interface to ModSAF.
QuickSet runs on both desktop and hand-held PC&apos;s,
communicating over wired and wireless LAN&apos;s, or modem
links. The system combines speech and pen-based gesture
input on multiple 3-lb hand-held PCs (Fujitsu Stylistic
1000), which communicate via wireless LAN through the
Open Agent Architecture (OAA)2 [8], to ModSAF, and also
to CommandVu. With this highly portable device, a user
can create entities, establish &amp;quot;control measures&amp;quot; (e.g.,
objectives, checkpoints, etc.), draw and label various lines
and areas, (e.g., landing zones) and give the entities
behavior.

<bodyText confidence="0.998671666666667">
Architecturally, QuickSet uses distributed agent
technologies based on the Open Agent Architecture for
interoperation, information brokering and distribution. An

<bodyText confidence="0.988780339622642">
agent-based architecture was chosen to support this
application because it offers easy connection to legacy
applications, and the ability to run the same set of software
components in a variety of hardware configurations, ranging
from stand-alone on the handheld PC, to distributed
operation across numerous workstations and PCs.
Additionally, the architecture supports mobility in that
lighter weight agents can run on the handheld, while more
computationally-intensive processing can be migrated
elsewhere on the network. The agents may be written in
any programming language (here, Quintus Prolog, Visual
C++, Visual Basic, and Java), as long as they communicate
via an interagent communication language. The
configuration of agents used in the Quickset system is
illustrated in Figure 3. A brief description of each agent
follows:
QuickSet interface: On the handheld PC is a geo-
referenced map of the region such that entities displayed on
the map are registered to their positions on the actual
terrain, and thereby to their positions on each of the various
user interfaces connected to the simulation. The map
interface agent provides the usual pan and zoom capabilities,
multiple overlays, icons, etc. The user can draw directly on
the map, in order to create points, lines, and areas. The user
can create entities, give them behavior, and watch the
simulation unfold from the handheld. When the pen is
placed on the screen, the speech recognizer is activated,
thereby allowing users to speak and gesture simultaneously.
Speech recognition agent: The speech recognition
agent used in QuickSet employs either IBM&apos;s VoiceType
Application Factory or VoiceType 3.0 recognizers. The
recognizers use an HMM-based continuous speaker-
independent speech recognition technology for PC&apos;s under
Windows 95/NT. Currently, the system has a vocabulary of
450 words. It produces a single most likely interpretation
of an utterance.
Gesture recognition agent: OGI&apos;s gesture recognition
agent processes all pen input from a PC screen or tablet.
The agent weights the results of both HMM and neural net
recognizers, producing a combined score for each of the
possible recognition results. Currently, 45 gestures can be
recognized, resulting in the creation of 21 military symbols,
irregular shapes, and various types of lines.
Natural language agent: The natural language agent
currently employs a definite clause grammar and produces
typed feature structures as a representation of the utterance
meaning. Currently, for this task, the language consists of
noun phrases that label entities, as well as a variety of
imperative constructs for supplying behavior.
Multimodal integration agent: The multimodal
interpretation agent accepts typed feature structure meaning
representations from the language and gesture recognition
agents, and produces a unified multimodal interpretation.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.988013315789474">
Simulation agent: The simulation agent, developed
primarily by SRI International, but modified by us for
multimodal interaction, serves as the communication
channel between the OAA-brokered agents and the ModSAF
simulation system. This agent offers an API for ModSAF
that other agents can use.
Web display agent: The Web display agent can be used
to create entities, points, lines, and areas. It posts queries
for updates to the state of the simulation via Java code that
interacts with the blackboard and facilitator. The queries are
routed to the running ModSAF simulation, and the
available entities can be viewed over a WWW connection
using a suitable browser.
Other user interfaces: When another user interface
connected to the facilitator subscribes to and produces the
same set of events as others, it immediately becomes part of
a collaboration. One can view this as human-human
collaboration mediated by the agent architecture, or as agent-
agent collaboration.
CommandVu agent: Since the CommandVu virtual
reality system is an agent, the same multimodal interface on
the handheld PC can be used to create entities and to fly the
user through the 3-D terrain. For example, the user can ask
&amp;quot;CommandVu, fly me to this platoon &lt;gesture on the
map&gt;.&amp;quot;
Application bridge agent: The bridge agent
generalizes the underlying applications&apos; API to typed feature
structures, thereby providing an interface to the various
applications such as ModSAF, ConunandVu, and Exinit.
This allows for a domain-independent integration
architecture in which constraints on multimodal
interpretation are stated in terms of higher-level constructs
such as typed feature structures, greatly facilitating reuse.
CORBA bridge agent: This agent converts OAA
messages to COREA IDL (Interface Definition Language)
for the Exercise Initialization project.
More detail on the architecture and the individual agents are
provided in [12, 22].

<bodyText confidence="0.999632714285714">
Holding QuickSet in hand, the user views a map from the
ModSAF simulation, and with spoken language coupled
with pen gestures, issues commands to ModSAF. In order
to create a unit in QuickSet, the user would hold the pen at
the desired location and utter (for instance): &amp;quot;red T72
platoon&amp;quot; resulting in a new platoon of the specified type
being created at that location.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.874419">
Figure 4: The QuickSet interface as the user

establishes two platoons, a barbed-wire fence, a
breached minefield, and then issues a command to one
platoon to follow a traced route.
The user then adds a barbed-wire fence to the simulation by
drawing a line at the desired location while uttering &amp;quot;barbed
wire.&amp;quot; Similarly a fortified line is added. A minefield of an
amorphous shape is drawn and is labeled verbally, and
finally an M IA1 platoon is created as above. Then the user
can assign a task to the new platoon by saying &amp;quot;M1A1
platoon follow this route&amp;quot; while drawing the route with the
pen. The results of these commands are visible on the
QuickSet screen, as seen in Figure 4, in the ModSAF
simulation, and in the CommandVu 3D rendering of the
scene. In addition to multimodal input, unimodal spoken
language and gestural commands can be given at any time,
depending on the user&apos;s task and preference.

6. MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999831615384615">
Since any unimodal recognizer will make mistakes, the
output of the gesture recognizer is not accepted as a simple
unilateral decision. Instead the recognizer produces a set of
probabilities, one for each possible interpretation of the
gesture. The recognized entities, as well as their
recognition probabilities, are sent to the facilitator, which
forwards them to the multimodal interpretation agent. In
combining the meanings of the gestural and spoken
interpretations, we attempt to satisfy an important design
consideration, namely that the communicative modalities
should compensate for each other&apos;s weaknesses [7, 16].
This is accomplished by selecting the highest scoring
unified interpretation of speech and gesture. Importantly,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991807">
22
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999689">
the unified interpretation might not include the highest
scoring gestural (or spoken language) interpretation because
it might not be semantically compatible with the other
mode. The key to this interpretation process is the use of a
typed feature structure [1, 3] as a meaning representation
language that is common to the natural language and
gestural interpretation agents. Johnston et al. [12] present
the details of multimodal integration of continuous speech
and pen-based gesture, guided by research in users&apos;
multimodal integration and synchronization strategies [19].
Unlike many previous approaches to multimodal integration
(e.g, [2, 9, 12, 15, 25]) speech is not &amp;quot;in charge,&amp;quot; in the
sense of relegating gesture a secondary and dependent role.
This mutually-compensatory interpretation process is
capable of analyzing multimodal constructions, as well as
speech-only and pen-only constructions when they occur.
Vo and Wood&apos;s system [24] is similar to the one reported
here, though we believe the use of typed feature structures
provides a more generally usable and formal integration
mechanism than their frame-merging strategy. Cheyer and
Julia [4] sketch a system based on Oviatt&apos;s [17] results and
the OAA [8], but do not discuss the integration strategy nor
multimodal compensation.

7. CONCLUDING REMARKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993702787234043">
QuickSet has been delivered to the US Navy (NRaD) and
US Marine Corps. for use at 29 Palms, California, where it
is primarily used to set up training scenarios and to control
the virtual environment. It is also installed at NRaD&apos;s
Command Center of the Future. The system was used by
the US Army&apos;s 82nd Airborne Corps. at Ft. Bragg during
the Royal Dragon Exercise. There, QuickSet was deployed
in a tent, where it was subjected to an extreme noise
environment, including explosions, low-flying jet aircraft,
generators, and the like. Not surprisingly, spoken
interaction with QuickSet was not feasible, although users
gestured successfully. Instead, users wanted to gesture.
Although we had provided a multimodal interface for use in
less hostile conditions, nevertheless we needed to
provide,and in fact have provided, a complete overlap in
functionality, such that any task can be accomplished just
with pen or just with speech when necessary. Finally,
QuickSet is now being extended for use in the ExInit
simulation initialization system for DARPA&apos;s STOW-97
Advanced Concept Demonstration that is intended for
creation of division-sized exercises.
Regarding the multimodal interface itself, QuickSet has
undergone a &amp;quot;proactive&amp;quot; interface evaluation in that the
studies that were performed in advance of building the
system predicted the utility of multimodal over unimodal
speech as an input to map-based systems [17, 18]. In
particular, it was discovered in this research that multimodal
interaction generates simpler language than unimodal
spoken commands to maps. For example, to create a
&amp;quot;phase line&amp;quot; between two three-digit &lt;x,y&gt; grid coordinates,
a user would have to say: &amp;quot;create a line from nine four three
nine six one to nine five seven nine six eight and call it
phase line green&amp;quot; [14]. In contrast, a QuickSet user would
say &amp;quot;phase line green&amp;quot; while drawing a line. Creation of area
features with unimodal speech would be more complex still,
if not infeasible. Given that numerous difficult-to-process
linguistic phenomena (such as utterance disfluencies) are
known to be elevated in lengthy utterances, and also to be
elevated when people speak locative constituents [17, 18],
multimodal interaction that permits pen input to specify
locations and that results in brevity offers the possibility of
more robust recognition.
Further development of QuickSet&apos;s spoken, gestural, and
multimodal integration capabilites are continuing. Research
is also ongoing to examine and quantify the benefits of
multimodal interaction in general, and our architecture in
particular.

In particular, it was discovered in this research that multimodal interaction generates simpler language than unimodal spoken commands to maps. For example, to create a &amp;quot;phase line&amp;quot; between two three-digit &lt;x,y&gt; grid coordinates, a user would have to say: &amp;quot;create a line from nine four three nine six one to nine five seven nine six eight and call it phase line green&amp;quot; [14]. In contrast, a QuickSet user would say &amp;quot;phase line green&amp;quot; while drawing a line. Creation of area features with unimodal speech would be more complex still, if not infeasible. Given that numerous difficult-to-process linguistic phenomena (such as utterance disfluencies) are known to be elevated in lengthy utterances, and also to be elevated when people speak locative constituents [17, 18], multimodal interaction that permits pen input to specify locations and that results in brevity offers the possibility of more robust recognition.

Instead the recognizer produces a set of probabilities, one for each possible interpretation of the gesture. The recognized entities, as well as their recognition probabilities, are sent to the facilitator, which forwards them to the multimodal interpretation agent. In combining the meanings of the gestural and spoken interpretations, we attempt to satisfy an important design consideration, namely that the communicative modalities should compensate for each other&apos;s weaknesses [7, 16]. This is accomplished by selecting the highest scoring unified interpretation of speech and gesture. Importantly, 22 the unified interpretation might not include the highest scoring gestural (or spoken language) interpretation because it might not be semantically compatible with the other mode.

KEYWORDS: multimodal interfaces, agent architecture, gesture recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, distributed interactive simulation. 1. INTRODUCTION In order to train personnel more effectively, the US military is developing large-scale distributed simulation capabilities. Begun as SIMNET in the 1980&apos;s [23], these distributed, interactive environments attempt to provide a high degree of fidelity in simulating combat, including simulations of the individual combatants, the equipment, entity movements, atmospheric effects, etc. There are four general phases of user interaction with these simulations: Creating entities, supplying their initial behavior, interacting with the entities during a running simulation, and reviewing the results. The present research concentrates on the first two of these stages. Our contribution to the distributed interactive simulation (DIS) effort is to rethink the natur</context>
