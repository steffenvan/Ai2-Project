LETTER TO THE EDITOR
IMPLICATIONS OF SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR VOCABULARY
ARCHITECTURE:
WILIUNS VS. WORDTREE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987067875">
Some three centuries ago, during Western Europe&apos;s
Age of Exploration, there was published a very original
and mammoth catalog of &amp;quot;the nature of things.&amp;quot; It had
been compiled by a Royal Society founder, John Wil-
kins. It was his pathbreaking Essay Towards . . . Lan-
guage (1668). The essay boldly attempted to specify all
variants under each category of thing. For example,
hundreds of &amp;quot;Manners&amp;quot; were listed, such as Modesty
and Magnanimity (pp. 206-213).
Wilkins&apos;s Essay is echoed in many later wordbooks
(e.g., Roget&apos;s Thesaurus) and even encyclopedias, al-
though rarely acknowledged.
His arrangement tried to point from a concept toward
its best term. That format is now sometimes called a
&amp;quot;nomenclator.&amp;quot; But in the three subsequent centuries,
the more common format has been its inverse, pointing
from a word or term to its meaning. The obvious
example of such a &amp;quot;semantic&amp;quot; is the alphabetical dic-
tionary. Indeed, little progress has been made in nomen-
clators since Wilkins.
But today&apos;s computerizing world increasingly faces
the problem of extracting experience-based wisdom
from each apparently novel circumstance. Therefore
today&apos;s need, especially in the emergent field of artifi-
cial intelligence, is far more for nomenclatoral systems
than for merely semantic systems.
One such scheme was recently published under the
name of The Wordtree (Burger 1984). The present
author, its editor, was therefore most gratified to find it
compared with Wilkins&apos;s Essay over many paragraphs
in this journal by Michael Lesk (1987).
On analysis, however, I find that it contains many
basic assumptions of computerization practitioners, but
not of social science practitioners (sometimes called
&amp;quot;telesizers&amp;quot;). Indeed, Lesk&apos;s critique can provide an
object lesson in the gap, the chasm, between some
computerizers and some telesizers.
The present author has been a computer user since
about 1950 and has a doctorate in cultural anthropology.
Editor&apos;s note: This letter is in response to a review of The Wordtree
in Issue 13-1,2 and should have appeared in the following issue,
13-3,4. It was unfortunately omitted from that issue and we only found
out about the omission recently.
It would seem valuable to indicate the differences, for
they may well be part of computational linguistics&apos;
unclaimed turf.
The approach of computational linguistics (CL) to
word architecture might, at the risk of oversimpli-
fication, be termed mathematical. That of the social
scientists may be termed evolutionary and cultural.
Anthropology, for instance, must have an inherent
interest in CL: symboling is the principal human dis-
tinctiveness, and anthropology concenters human dis-
tinctions. Linguistics, a consequence of symboling, is
usually considered one of the five branches of anthro-
pology.

WILKINS&apos;S SUBSTANTIVE-PROCESSUAL INTERMINGLING VS.
WORDTREE&apos;S BOHRISM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980849235294117">
One principal difference concerns the relation of con-
cepts about substances to concepts about processes.
Wilkins assumed that &amp;quot;a Verb . . . ought to have no
distinct place amongst Integrals [=principal words] in a
Philosophical [=ideal] Grammar, because it is really no
other then [=than] an Adjective . . .&amp;quot; (1668:303).
Hence Wilkins constantly intermingled structural adjec-
tives and nouns with processual verbs. Thus, his pages
253-254 leaped from procedures like encouraging, com-
forting, and defending to substances like grange, fruit
tree, and tame beast. Reviewer Lesk comments that, by
contrast, the Wordtree arrangement &amp;quot;clashes. . . [with]
countries, chemical elements, and so on.&amp;quot;
True. As The Wordtree declares in many places, such
as page 28, &amp;quot;we extend [to vocabulary architecture,]
Niels Bohr&apos;s theory of complementarity: Light is both
material (e.g., particle) and process (e.g., wave
motion). . . . But physicists find that they can measure
little unless they emphasize one or the other anal-
ysis. . . .&amp;quot;
Bohr&apos;s Nobel-winning concept is central to modern
science. It led to the realization that if one specifies the
exact location of an object, it must be at rest (= Werner
Heisenberg&apos;s Principle). And that has produced the
system of quantum mechanics.
But this crucial scientific bifurcation does not seem
to have penetrated linguistics. Non-Wordtree word-
books routinely intermingle substances (typically, the
noun, which the British tradition insightfully terms
&amp;quot;substantive&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;noun&amp;quot;) and process (typi-
cally, verbs).

By contrast, The Wordtree has applied to vocabu-
lary, probably for the first time, those principles of hard
science first enunciated around the 1910s. The Wordtree
consequently argued that a substance may ultimately be
defined only in terms of other substances, and a process
only via other processes. Therefore we endeavored to
gradate the entire language&apos;s processes purely in terms
of a hierarchy of processes.
Lesk went on to test-use The Wordtree &amp;quot;for an
alternative to [the word] to REP-RESENT. . . .,&amp;quot; and
found it slower than Roget. Of course. As our page 24
declared, &amp;quot;We do not claim that &apos;The Wordtree&apos; is a
guide to common speech. To describe the world, use
traditional word books. But to maneuver or change the
world, use &apos;The Wordtree&apos;!&amp;quot; And to find an alternative
for a word is the static task of description rather than
change. For that job, Lesk was sound in preferring a
thesaurus.
Sometime, however, he may want to find causes,
preventives, or effects of a concept; then he should use
a branching nomenclator. For instance, &amp;quot;The Word-
tree&amp;quot; lists one tabooing cause as sectarianizing. In lay
terms, that means that for one part of the population to
be kept off-limits to a certain site or practice, a culture
must have been divided into coteries or sects. We do
not think that a semantic format can show any such
conceptual relationship.

WILKINS&apos;S DISCRETENESS VS. WORDTREE&apos;S
CONNECTEDNESS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994806">
Another chasm between a computerizer&apos;s acceptance of
his Essay and a brancher concerns conceptual bound-
aries. Wilkins perceived each of his (more-or-less
words) as being discrete. And it sometimes seems as if
CL&apos;ers likewise take each word at its face value, rather
than considering the unit transformable into neighboring
idea possibilities.
By contrast, a branching word system assumes the
interrelatedness and indeed the lability of concepts. Our
nomenclator does so via geological, biological, and
cultural evolution. For example, a vegetable that is
motile is, in a generic sense, a kind of bacterium. And
so, in The Wordtree&apos;s language of binary transitive
verbs: To vegetalize something and to motorize it = to
bacterize it.
But Wilkins was true to his age and church, and
implied substantive perpetuity. In fact, his linguistic
essay explained how diverse absolute creations could
have survived: The good bishop devoted seven pages
(162-168) to showing geometrically how Noah&apos;s Ark
probably accommodated everything from polecats to
dung!
How seriously, then, can we take a CL critique that
&amp;quot;would rather have [—follow] the older book,&amp;quot; because
the newer branching system &amp;quot;clashes . . . with tradi-
tional and familiar arrangements&amp;quot;?!

ETHNOGRAPHY

<bodyText confidence="0.998772265306123">
Wilkins&apos;s goal was codification, not heuristics (dis-
covery procedures). Where a genus required uncertain
terms, he shyly asterisked the &amp;quot;several words . . .
which are yet very questionable&amp;quot; (1668:Reader&apos;s Pref-
ace).
By contrast, our brancher argued that only a small
part of (legitimate) vocabulary has yet been recorded,
even in the largest unabridged wordbooks. Processual
complexification systems have not been performed pre-
viously for an entire language. Therefore our first
edition suffers many conceptual gaps, especially in
areas like biomechanics. We frequently concede that
fact (as on p. 45). The situation resembles the first
describer of the color spectrum: he probably could offer
only the names of a few basic colors. But gradually the
names were found, or invented, for the hundreds of
intermediate hues, such as purple.
Our branching system seeks to report those hitherto
uncodified names, particularly from the technical lexi-
con, or technolect. We obtained most of them by the
anthropological method of &amp;quot;reporting what the natives
say.&amp;quot; Hence we were able to list an exact site for each
of the 24,600 transitives there distinguished. And that
first approach represented 30% more transitive mor-
phemes than in the world&apos;s hitherto largest dictionary,
the Oxford Unabridged.
Typically, Lesk disliked to vorlauf. But we had
evidenced that term to page 207 of a popular-speech
reporting journal: One vorlaufs (a ski course) to estab-
lish its time and conditions. We believe that its very
incorporation into the process system of English will
henceforth interdigitate vorlauf with the norm-settings
of inanimate matters, such as to calibrate.
Likewise, to Zip-Code-sequence (a mailing) was not
our invention, but was noted as detected on page 3 of a
1982 official U.S. Postal Service bulletin. We think that
revealing it will fill a semantic gap with the many
processes of geocoding that are now emergent in our
era of satellites.
In fact, we specified a source for 100% of our
transitives, whether printed or broadcast, by page or by
minute. Such documentary thoroughness is an unheard-
of rarity in the field of lexicography. These are not,
then, &amp;quot;rare or made-up words.&amp;quot; They are the sounds of
the real world.
The problem of their strangeness is that lexicography
has hitherto been dominated by litterateurs gently
raised on what field anthropologists sarcastically call
the &amp;quot;verandah&amp;quot; of an ivory tower.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990300862745098">
Another misunderstanding between the CL use of tra-
ditional word arrangements and the social science tra-
dition concerns the path of complexification. Semantic
word systems are straight-line. The dictionary moves
Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 3, September 1988 105
Henry G. Burger Letter to the Editor
from A through Z. And a synonymy, such as Roget&apos;s,
moves from group 1 through group 1,000. But the world
is not merely Aristotelian numerics. Darwin showed
over a century ago that complexification proceeds mul-
tilinearily (by progenerative branching, &amp;quot;cladisti-
catty&amp;quot;). Chimpanzees are our cousins, not our ances-
tors.
The selection of an evolutionary path is multifacto-
rial. An ecological space, or lebensraum, must be
vacant. An organic group must be present at its border.
That organism must have a supply of appropriate mu-
tations. In sum, &amp;quot;the course of [biological] evolution
follows opportunity rather than plan . . .,&amp;quot; explained
Simpson (1960:160). &amp;quot;Changes occur as they may and
not as would be hypothetically best.&amp;quot;
That simple observation means that the environment
necessarily contains as many factors (and almost surely
many times over) as ever can be entered, however
automatically, into any computer, however speedy.
Computers can, then, never surely predict organic
interactions.
But the concept of Darwinism was not present in
Wilkins&apos;s time. Indeed, Origin of Species was not even
published until seven years after Roget. Thus, pre-
Darwinian hierarchies are mere conglomerates. In that
way, Wilkins listed mere &amp;quot;magnitudes&amp;quot; (IL VII) as
more complex than &amp;quot;vivaparous animals&amp;quot; (II:V). And
Roget listed such powered-system characteristics as
&amp;quot;excitability (#825) as far more advanced than such
human-only characteristics as &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; (#593).
By contrast, using late 20th-century evolutionary
concepts, The Wordtree shows the gradual complexifi-
cation from the most primitive terms, such as spatializ-
ing. It covered the stages between mere atomization and
vegetation by incorporating modern general systems
theory. Thus, Marney and Smith (1964:124-127) began
with radiant energy. When supplemented with nuclear
binding, some of it became nuclei. With atomic binding,
and chemical valence, some became molecules. With
self-replication, some became polymers. And so forth.
Animality, for example, is currently believed to have
required the very basic biogramming of bipolarizing,
bacterizing, vegetalizing, etc. And the knowledge ex-
plosion in genetic engineering will soon doubtlessly
name dozens of intermediate procedures.

WILKINS&apos;S FINITENESS VS. WORDTREE&apos;S OPEN-ENDEDNESS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999104807692308">
The static world of 1668 is reflected in Wilkins&apos;s limited
concept of vocabulary: &amp;quot;There should be little need of
other impositions. . . . But . . . for greater eloquence
and copiousness of Speech, it should be capable
[=allowable] . . . to join the [permissible] words com-
pounded. . . . So the word idolatry is [also expressable
as] Idol-worship, etc.&amp;quot; (1668:354).
Alas, the post-1668 emergence of social science
shows otherwise. Vocabulary formats evolve with the
time and place, or zeitgeist. They reflect context and
culture. Notorious instances are the Innuit&apos;s (Eskimos&apos;)
multiplicity of snow words, and the Yankees&apos; plenitude
of drunk terms.
Now, only a small part of history involves writing.
And only a fraction of humanity has been literate. Yet
even the Oxford Unabridged neglects the fountainhead
of neologism, which is oral speech.
Therefore The Wordtree has sought it out, especially
by interviewing technicians and professionals. And, as
noted earlier, we cite a source for each transitive. Our
very first edition shows a quarter-million listings.
Now, Lesk wondered if our binary definitions are
&amp;quot;oversimplified&amp;quot;: To fish something is merely to catch
it and to draw it. So, he asks, wouldn&apos;t that apply also
to tempting, stealing, etc.?
Yes, indeed. A language has both general/generic
terms and specific terms. Fishing may originally have
concerned only aquatic creatures. But today it is used
broadly. And a branching system defines by the lowest
common denominator.
We have found that a culture also creates a precise
term for each semantic niche. To fish something out by
scrutinizing, for example, is to expiscate it.
As long as a wordbook forces one term, such as to
fish, to represent many diverse procedures, automatic
translation cannot occur. There are simply too many
possibilities. An intermediate step is needed, first to
translate which kind of fishing is meant. Only then can
clear meanings (such perhaps as a defining phrase)
appear. And The Wordtree&apos;s listing at &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot; does
define some 15 variant (superacteme) forms like expi-
scate.
We do not say that the step must be done by human
hands. Content analysis, for example, may assign prob-
ability weightings almost instantly. But we say that such
a name-specifying brancher has been lacking, and that
The Wordtree has finally collocated the gradations.
Hence CL should rejoice in the open-endedness offered
by a branching word system. It should welcome this
emphasis on discovering and integrating current techni-
cal lexemes with the long-established, abstract (&amp;quot;ink-
horn&amp;quot;) words.

CONCLUSION: CL NEEDS APPLIED SOCIAL SCIENCE

<bodyText confidence="0.997928133333333">
The continuing lack of social scientists&apos; input both to
this periodical and to the CL discipline is not accidental
but significant. We have therefore outlined 5 of the
fundaments that applied social science now offers:
segregating processual words from substantive words;
far more ethnographic reportage of technolect; the
connectedness, not discreteness, of terms; the world as
branching not unilinear; vocabulary as open-ended not
finite; and finally, near-synonyms to be nuanced, not
comingled.
When we note some of the major assumptions
present in the latter but not the former, we may under-
stand why much of today&apos;s CL is technically brilliant
but culturally trivial.

Wilkins has contributed to CL by revaling the incom-
pleteness of some of its premises. For the real world
consists of human interactions. To abstract and analyze
will require the contributions and cooperation of many
more, especially social, disciplines than currently ap-
pear in the typical CL curriculum.

And a synonymy, such as Roget&apos;s, moves from group 1 through group 1,000. But the world is not merely Aristotelian numerics. Darwin showed over a century ago that complexification proceeds multilinearily (by progenerative branching, &amp;quot;cladisticatty&amp;quot;). Chimpanzees are our cousins, not our ancestors. The selection of an evolutionary path is multifacto- An ecological space, or be vacant. An organic group must be present at its border. That organism must have a supply of appropriate mutations. In sum, &amp;quot;the course of [biological] evolution follows opportunity rather than plan . . .,&amp;quot; explained Simpson (1960:160). &amp;quot;Changes occur as they may and not as would be hypothetically best.&amp;quot; That simple observation means that the environment necessarily contains as many factors (and almost surely many times over) as ever can be entered, however automatically, into any computer, however speedy. Computers can, then, never surely predict organic interactions. But the concept of Darwinism was not present in time. Indeed, of Species not even published until seven years after Roget. Thus, pre- Darwinian hierarchies are mere conglomerates. In that way, Wilkins listed mere &amp;quot;magnitudes&amp;quot; (IL VII) as more complex than &amp;quot;vivaparous animals&amp;quot; (II:V). And Roget listed such powered-system characteristics as &amp;quot;excitability (#825) as far more advanced than such human-only characteristics as &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; (#593). By contrast, using late 20th-century evolutionary Wordtree the gradual complexification from the most primitive terms, such as spatializing. It covered the stages between mere atomization and vegetation by incorporating modern general systems theory. Thus, Marney and Smith (1964:124-127) began with radiant energy. When supplemented with nuclear binding, some of it became nuclei. With atomic binding, and chemical valence, some became molecules. With self-replication, some became polymers. And so forth. Animality, for example, is currently believed to have the very basic biogramming of vegetalizing, And the knowledge explosion in genetic engineering will soon doubtlessly name dozens of intermediate procedures. WILKINS&apos;S FINITENESS VS. WORDTREE&apos;S OPEN-ENDEDNESS The static world of 1668 is reflected in Wilkins&apos;s limited concept of vocabulary: &amp;quot;There should be little need of other impositions. . . . But . . . for greater eloquence and copiousness of Speech, it should be capable [=allowable] . . . to join the [permissible] words com- . . . So the word [also expressable (1668:354). Alas, the post-1668 emergence of social science shows otherwise. Vocabulary formats evolve with the and place, or reflect context and Notorious instances are the Innuit&apos;s of and the Yankees&apos; plenitude Now, only a small part of history involves writing. And only a fraction of humanity has been literate. Yet the Unabridged the fountainhead of neologism, which is oral speech. Wordtree sought it out, especially by interviewing technicians and professionals. And, as noted earlier, we cite a source for each transitive. Our very first edition shows a quarter-million listings. Now, Lesk wondered if our binary definitions are To is merely to and to So, he asks, wouldn&apos;t that apply also stealing, Yes, indeed. A language has both general/generic and specific terms. originally have concerned only aquatic creatures. But today it is used broadly. And a branching system defines by the lowest common denominator. We have found that a culture also creates a precise term for each semantic niche. To fish something out by example, is to long as a wordbook forces one term, such as represent many diverse procedures, automatic translation cannot occur. There are simply too many possibilities. An intermediate step is needed, first to which meant. Only then can clear meanings (such perhaps as a defining phrase) And Wordtree&apos;s at &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot; does some 15 variant like expiscate. We do not say that the step must be done by human hands. Content analysis, for example, may assign probability weightings almost instantly. But we say that such a name-specifying brancher has been lacking, and that Wordtree finally collocated the gradations. Hence CL should rejoice in the open-endedness offered by a branching word system. It should welcome this emphasis on discovering and integrating current technical lexemes with the long-established, abstract (&amp;quot;inkhorn&amp;quot;) words. CONCLUSION: CL NEEDS APPLIED SOCIAL SCIENCE The continuing lack of social scientists&apos; input both to this periodical and to the CL discipline is not accidental but significant. We have therefore outlined 5 of the fundaments that applied social science now offers: segregating processual words from substantive words; far more ethnographic reportage of technolect; the connectedness, not discreteness, of terms; the world as branching not unilinear; vocabulary as open-ended not finite; and finally, near-synonyms to be nuanced, not comingled. When we note some of the major assumptions present in the latter but not the former, we may understand why much of today&apos;s CL is technically brilliant but culturally trivial. Hence Lesk&apos;s discussion of the pre-evolutionary Computational Linguistics, Volume Number 3, September 1988 Henry G. Burger Letter to the Editor Wilkins has contributed to CL by revaling the incompleteness of some of its premises. For the real world consists of human interactions. To abstract and analyze will require the contributions and cooperation of many more, especially social, disciplines than currently appear in the typical CL curriculum.</abstract>
