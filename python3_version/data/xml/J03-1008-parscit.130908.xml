The Spoken Language Translator consists of
21 chapters contributed by different authors
who worked on the building of components
and/or the overall system for the Spoken
Language Translator (SLT), an early project
in the area of automatic speech translation.
The book presents a detailed description of
various technologies developed during the
period of the SLT project, with an empha-
sis on language and linguistic processing. It
includes four parts: language processing and
corpora, linguistic coverage, speech process-
ing, and evaluation and conclusions.
The SLT used a multiengine machine
translation architecture. The main machine
translation engine is a complex, unification
grammar–based system intended to perform
deep analysis and to produce high-quality
output. The authors claim that the hand-
coded grammars used in SLT are linguisti-
cally motivated and generic in nature. There-
fore, the grammar coverage is broad, and it
is feasible to use these methods in serious
applications. However, the translation task
was evaluated only in the domain of air
travel reservations. The authors also worked
on methods to convert grammars generated
for English to corresponding grammars for
French and Swedish, as well as the possi-
bility of writing a single large grammar for
two closely related languages. The grammar-
based subsystem is responsible for structural
translation via the quasi-logical form transfer
method.
Another translation engine used in SLT is
a simple word-to-word system, intended for
shallow processing, speed, robustness, and
broad coverage. The word-to-word transla-
tion component simply uses rules to asso-
ciate a source language phrase of one or
more words with a target language phase of
zero or more words. Source language words
may be tagged with part-of-speech labels.
This technique was intended to fill in the
gaps (i.e., to translate utterances that are not
covered by the grammars, including utter-
ances that are grammatically incorrect, such
as speech recognition errors or disfluencies
in spontaneous speech).
The speech recognition technology used in
SLT was a state-of-the-art hidden Markov
model–based approach, with some interest-
ing new techniques, such as discrete-mixture
models, which run two to three times faster
than continuous-density models with similar
recognition performance. The speech recog-
nition system was developed for multilin-
gual speech and is capable of decoding a
word string in any of a given set of lan-
guages. Both acoustic modeling and lan-
guage modeling issues for a multilingual
recognition system are addressed. Text-to-
speech translation is an inevitable part of
a speech-to-speech translation system. How-
ever, text-to-speech technology is not con-
sidered in this book, and prosody transla-
tion and prosody transfer are described only
briefly.
A series of empirical evaluation experi-
ments is thoroughly described and the re-
sults analyzed in chapter 20. Although all
evaluations are subjective, several fine scales
are used for quality judgment. Furthermore,
the main system performance is compared
when variations are generated either by re-
placing selected components or changing the
values of the critical parameters. One inter-
esting study discussed in this chapter is on
“pipeline synergy,” which is based on the
intuition that “utterances that are hard to
hear are also hard to understand and trans-
late.” The authors show that assuming that
error rates for the individual components
are independent can lead to serious overesti-
mates of the system error rate. This chapter is
worthwhile for readers who are interested in
performance evaluation of speech-to-speech
translation systems.
In general, this book is a useful resource
for those who are interested in knowing
how to build a speech-to-speech translation
system, especially for those who are inter-
ested in grammar-based language processing
approaches.—Yuqing Gao, IBM T. J. Watson Re-

“The title of this collection of articles, Many
Morphologies, is an allusion not only to the va-
riety of morphological problems discussed,
but also to the diversity of formal solutions
offered by the authors. The papers exam-
ine Polish derivational morphology, French
and English compounding, pluralization in
Luise˜no and Somali, and more, and though
almost all of the papers are written in the
generative grammar framework, there are
considerable differences between the formal
methods they apply to the problems at hand.
We also include two papers which discuss
computational morphology, one an overview
of the current state of the field and the
other an in-depth study of a current research
project.”—From the introduction
