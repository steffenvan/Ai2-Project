Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99995448">
The paper presents a computational theory
for resolving Japanese zero anaphora, based
on the notion of discourse segment. We see
that the discourse segment reduces the do-
main of antecedents for zero anaphora and
thus leads to their efficient resolution.
Also we make crucial use of functional no-
tions such as empathy hierarchy and mini-
mal semantics thesis to resolve reference for
zero anaphora [Kuno, 1987]. Our approach
differs from the Centering analysis [Walker
et al., 1990] in that the resolution works
by matching one empathy hierarchy against
another, which makes it possible to deal
with discourses with no explicit topic and
those with cataphora [Halliday and Hassan,
1990].
The theory is formalized through the
definite clause grammar(DCG) formalism
[Pereira and Warren, 1980],[Gazdar and
Mellish, 1989; Longacre, 1979].
Finally, we show that graphology i.e., quo-
tation mark, spacing, has an important ef-
fect on the interpretation of zero anaphora
in Japanese discourse.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999717789473684">
Over the past years, schemes like Focusing and Cen-
tering have dominated computational approaches
to resolving anaphora [Sidner, 1983; Walker et al.,
1990]. Their success derives from the utility they
have in identifying salient discourse entities such as
topic and thereby locating the antecedent for an
anaphor. But they all suffer from the problem of
directionality; they process the text (the list of sen-
tences) from left to right, picking out focus along
the way and see if a anaphor corefers with a focus
already encountered. With the one-way processing,
forward-looking pronouns (cataphora) are not pos-
sible to resolve. Since Japanese has great tolerance
with forward reference, a proper theory of zero pro-
nouns should meet the problem of directionality.
In what follows, we discuss some points about dis-
course segment and zero pronoun in Japanese. We
begin by introducing the idea of discourse segment.
Consider the pair:

<bodyText confidence="0.981847363636364">
Taro prepared the plates, Hanako arranged food.
Here, 02 represents a suppressed expression. It acts
as an indirect object of the verb moritsuketa.1 1
and 2 are morphologically identical except that 1
has ga (nominative marker) where 2 has wa (topic
marker). But they differ widely in meaning:1 im-
plies that Hanako arranged food on the plates that
Taro prepared, the reading 2 does not imply; in 2,
&apos;Here and throughout, we intend the term 01 to rep-
resent a zero pronoun for the subject, 02 for the indirect
object, and 03 for the direct object.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99995875862069">
Hanako could have arranged food on plates some-
body other than Taro prepared. Now locating the
difference will involve the notion of discourse seg-
ment. A discourse segment is defined as a set of
sentences which appear in some region of text and
which is delimited by a topic-particle wa. Thus 2
breaks up into two segments, a clause with Taro-ga
and one with Hanako-wa;1, containing no wa-marked
element, forms a segment by itself. Section 2.1 pro-
vides syntactic definitions for the discourse segment.
Another important feature of discourse segment is
that of complying with the Minimal Semantics The-
sis (MST) [Nomoto, 1992], a functional property that
makes a segment cohere. The MST says, &apos;Assume
as identical any pair of zero pronouns if it is part
of some segment and does not occur as arguments
for the segment&apos;s predicate.&apos; Thus any pair of zero
pronouns that fall into the domain of discourse seg-
ment are taken to be coreferential, unless they occur
for the same predicate.2 Significantly, the MST is
amenable to syntactic treatment.
In addition, we make use of the empathy hierarchy
to choose between coreference relationships admitted
by the MST. We specify a predicate for the empathy
hierarchy and resolve zero anaphora by unifying one
predicate&apos;s empathy hierarchy with another which
occurs in the same segment. Since unification is a
non-directional operation, we are able to treat for-
ward as well as backward reference.

<bodyText confidence="0.99588825">
A discourse segment (DS) is a two-part structure
consisting of head and body; a head is a nominal
with a wa marking; a body is a set of sentences, which
end with a period. Note that an adjunctive clause
is not a sentence here, since it ends with connectives
like -node because, -kara because/after, -to and-then,
etc. Formally, we assume sentence has the following
analyses, which are given in the DCG formalism.

C+ denotes one or more occurrences of clause, C* zero
or more occurrences of clause, and N(PP:wa) denotes
a wa-marked nominal;pp : wa specifies that the at-
tribute pp (for postposition) has wa for the value.3Let
us define discourse segment by:
2 [Hobbs, to appear] talks about the cognitive economy
in understanding discourse: it says in effect that coher-
ence is the result of minimizing the number of entities in
discourse.
3We take a wa-marked nominal to be a sentence adver-
bial. Thus our approach differs from the traditional gap
analysis of topic construction [Kuroda, 1965; Inoue, 1978;
Kitagawa, 1982; Gunji, 1987], which assumes that a wa-

As discussed in section 1, we choose to restrict D to
containing at most one N(pp:wa). We implement the
restriction by way of some additions to the rule set

Here, the 6 rule takes care of inverted sentence and
the 6 rule non-inverted sentence. The rule set 6
enforces unification between the head value and the
morph value, morph represents the morphology of the
nominal; thus morph: taro specifies that the associ-
ated nominal has the morphology &amp;quot;taro&amp;quot;.
Notice that unification fails on a multiply headed
segment. A head attribute, once instantiated to
some value, will never unify with another. Unifi-
cation, therefore, acts to limit each segment in the
discourse to a single head. Note also that an non-
headed discourse, that is, discourse with no headed
segments, has a legitimate DS analysis, for unifica-
tion is possible between empty heads. The following
lists the rules for DS Grammar.

2.2 Headed vs. Non-Headed Discourse
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999347125">
The discourse can be perfectly intelligible without
an explicit topic or wa-nominal, which implies that
a discourse segment may not be headed at all. It
appears, however, that a discourse segment always
comes out headed except when there is no head avail-
able in the text. In fact, a segment associates with
a head nominal regardless of where it occurs in that
segment.

Let us say that a discourse is headed if each of its
segments is headed, and non-headed, otherwise. Our
assumption is that a discourse is either headed or
non-headed, and not both (e.g. figure 1, figure 2).5
Formally, this will be expressed through the value

5It is interesting to note that a multiple-head dis-

pens when discourse segments (DS) for a discourse, share
an identical head, say, Taro and head-unifies with each
other. In fact, such a reduction is linguistically possible
and attested everywhere. Our guess is that a repeated
use of the same wa-phrase may help the reader to keep
track of a coreferent for zero anaphora.

2.3 Minimal Semantics Thesis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996545166666667">
Minimal Semantics Thesis (MST) concerns the way
zero pronouns are interpreted in the discourse seg-
ment; it involves an empirical claim that the seg-
ment&apos;s zeros are coreferential unless considerations
on the empathy hierarchy (section 2.4) dictate to the
contrary.

We see that 14 constitutes a single discourse segment.
According to the minimal semantics thesis, all of the
zeros in the segment are interpreted as coreferential,
which is consistent with the reading we have for the
example. Here is a more complex discourse.

Taro went downtown to buy a clothing. Masako

The first two zeros refer to Taro and the last two refer
to Masako. But this is exactly what the MST pre-
dicts; 15 breaks up into two discourse segments, one
that starts with Taro-wa and the other that starts
with Masako-wa, so zeros for each segment become
coreferential.

2.4 Empathy Hierarchy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981133333333">
It appears to be a fact about Japanese that the
speaker of an utterance empathizes or identifies more
with the subject than with the indirect object; and
more with the indirect object than with the direct
object [Kuno, 1987; Kuno and Kaburaki, 1977]. In
fact, there are predicates in Japanese which are lexi-
cally specified to take an empathy-loaded argument;
yaru give and kureru receive are two such. For yaru,
the speaker empathizes with the subject, but with
the indirect object, in the case of kureru.
The relevance of the speaker&apos;s empathy to the reso-
lution problem is that an empathized entity becomes
more salient than other elements in the discourse
and thus more likely to act as the antecedent for
an anaphor.

Taro gave Masako a favor in buying her a book.
She still keeps it with care.
In 16, 01, subject of the second sentence, corefers
with the indirect object Masako in the first sen-
tence, which is assigned empathy by virtue of the
verb kureta.
Formally, we define the empathy hierarchy as a
function with three arguments.6
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.357999">
empathy(Z1, Z2, Z3)
</equation>
<footnote confidence="0.933762666666667">
6The definition is based on the observation that
Japanese predicates take no more than three argument
roles.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.998669">
With the definition at hand, we are able to formulate
the lexical specification for kureru:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.980385666666667">
V (empathy(Arg2, Argl, Arg3),
subject:Arg1, object2:Arg2,
object:Arg3) -&gt; [kureru].
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.678023">
yaru has the formulation like the following:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993049333333333">
V ( empathy(Arg1, Arg2, Arg3),
subject:Arg1, object2:Arg2,
object:Arg3) -&gt; [yaruu].
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99479">
Further, let us assume that variables in the em-
pathy hierarchy represent zero pronouns. If a vari-
able in the hierarchy is instantiated to some non-zero
item, we will remove the variable from the hierarchy
and move the items following by one position to the
left; we might call it empathy shifting.&apos; Now consider
the discourse:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.8673">

18(1) corresponds to the empathy hierarchy for the
first clause in 17; 18(b) corresponds to the hierarchy
for the second clause. Unifying the two structures
gives us the correct result: namely, 01&lt;i&gt; =
and 02&lt;j&gt; = 02&lt;,&gt;. Notice that zero items in the
segment are all unified through the empathy hierar-
chy, which in effect realizes the Minimal Semantics
Thesis. As it turns out, the MST reduces the number
of semantically distinct zero pronouns for a discourse
segment to at most three (figure 3). We conclude the
section with a listing of the relevant DCG rules.

Here are the facts:(a) zero anaphora occurring within
the quotation (internal anaphora) are coreferential
either with Taro or with Masako; (b) those occurring
outside (external anaphora), however, all refer to chi-
chioya; (c) chichioya has an anaphoric link which
crosses over the entire quotation; (d) syntactically,
the quoted portion functions as a complement for
the verb -to itta. It appears, moreover, that an in-
ternal anaphor associates itself with Taro in case it
occurs in the segment headed with Taro, and with
Masako in case it occurs in the segment headed with
Masako. Then, since the quoted discourse consists of
a set of discourse segments, it will be assigned to a
T-structure. But the structure does not extend over
the part 01 itta, which completes the discourse, for
the 01 corefers with chichioya, and neither with Taro

There is a curious interaction between a paragraph-
break and a T/D-structure. [Fujisawa et al.,
1993], for instance, observes a strong tendency that
Japanese zero anaphora are paragraph-bounded.
The following is from Nihon Keizai Shinbun, a
Japanese economics newspaper.

[Zero-anaphora are made explicit here for expository
purposes; they are not part of the newspaper. The
rest appears as it does in the paper.] From the way
same-index anaphora are distributed over the dis-
course, it seems rather obvious that a paragraph
break has an effect of marking a segment for the
discourse.9 The present theory, however, fails to deal
with the situation like this; it simply assigns a single
DS structure to the discourse in question, giving a
wrong interpretation that zero anaphora present are
all coreferential. As it stands, nothing in the theory
provides for treating graphological marks such as a
paragraph break. Yet, it is unclear to us whether a
paragraph break is a signal for a T- or D-structure.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990987847826087">
We have developed a computational theory for re-
solving zero anaphora in Japanese, drawing on the
results from previous works on Japanese discourse
[Kuno, 1987; Kuno and Kaburaki, 1977], etc). A ma-
jor departure from the traditional analyses of zero
anaphora lies in the reduction of the space of an-
tecedents for zero anaphora. This has been made
possible by adopting ideas like Discourse Segment,
Minimal Semantics Thesis and Empathy Hierarchy.
In particular, we have shown that the Minimal Se-
mantics Thesis leads to reducing the number of an-
tecedents for a segment to at most three. Also shown
in the paper is that the resolution of zero anaphora
is part of parsing text, so no additional mechanism is
9 We may note that a recursive embedding of discourse
of the sort we have discussed above is effected through
the explicit use of quotation marks; their absence would
lead to the outright ungrammaticality.
needed. Furthermore, the present theory compares
favorably with the previous schemes like Focusing
and Centering in that it is able to deal with forward-
and backward-looking anaphora by virtue of the way
unification operates on the empathy hierarchy.
Part of our discussion has touched on the effect of
graphology on the semantics of discourse. To date,
no significant research has been done on that area
of academic interests. The literature suggest that in
the written language, texts, i.e., cohesive discourses,
are marked through a variety of linguistic and non-
linguistic means: non-alphanumeric characters (quo-
tation marks, brackets, parentheses), graphic devices
(indentation, tabulation, itemization), and so on
[Nunberg, 1990; Halliday and Hassan, 1990]. Thus
a discourse segment might qualify for the texthood
since it has the property that zero pronouns are re-
solved internally. Its indicator is, of course, the topic
particle wa. But for the T-structure, it is far from
clear whether it is anyway cohesive, and if it is, what
its indicators are. (Quotation mark and paragraph
break are possible candidates.)
Some of the technical as well as linguistic details
are yet to be worked out; we have not talked about
how the topic comes to be associated with one or
more zero pronouns in the segment. Considerations
on empathy may well influence the choice of pro-
nouns to be matched with.

Also we make crucial use of functional nosuch as hierarchy minisemantics thesis resolve reference for zero anaphora [Kuno, 1987]. Our approach from the [Walker al., 1990] that the resolution works by matching one empathy hierarchy against another, which makes it possible to deal with discourses with no explicit topic and those with cataphora [Halliday and Hassan, 1990]. The theory is formalized through the definite clause grammar(DCG) formalism [Pereira and Warren, 1980],[Gazdar and Mellish, 1989; Longacre, 1979]. Finally, we show that graphology i.e., quotation mark, spacing, has an important effect on the interpretation of zero anaphora in Japanese discourse.</abstract>
