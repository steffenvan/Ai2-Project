While respecting its historical link with the field of MT, Machine Translation is
changing and broadening its scope of interest to encompass all branches of
Computational Linguistics and Language Engineering, wherever they =
incorporate a MULTILINGUAL aspect. We therefore welcome submissions to r+
the journal on THEORETICAL, DESCRIPTIVE OR COMPUTATIONAL r+
ASPECTS of any of the following topics: -0
- machine translation and machine-aided translation ...,,
- human translation theory and practise multilingual text composition and generation ........
- multilingual information retrieval *
- multilingual natural language interfaces
- multilingual dialogue systems *
- multilingual message understanding systems *
- corpus-based and statistical language modelling
- connectionist approaches to translation compilation and use of bi- and
multilingual corpora *
- discourse phenomena and their treatment in (human or machine) translation Xa
- knowledge engineering SU
- contrastive linguistics
- morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics &apos;0
- computer-aided language instruction and learning
- software localization and internationalization =
- speech processing, especially for speech translation
- phonetics, phonology
- computational implications of non-Roman character sets
- multilingual word-processing
- the multilingual information society (sociological and legal as well as linguistic
aspects)
- minority languages
- history of machine translation.
We would also welcome your suggestions about other features you would like Kluwer
to see in this journal, for example, special issues, squibs, topical comment.

Thousands of languages and
millions of words
proliferate in the world.
Yet non-verbal communication
sometimes drives home the
most powerful message.
LINgnuage&apos;
Knowing how to read the signs, both verbal
and non-verbal, can make a difference in
the international business deal. Or a cross
cultural marriage. Or a multilateral treaty.
You&apos;ll find the keys in Linguistics and Language
Behavior Abstracts (LLBA).
It&apos;s about word use and abuse. About the rapid
evolution of language. And how communication
shapes our lives.
In LLBA you&apos;ll find abstracts of scholarly articles and
books as well as bibliographical entries for book and
other media reviews and dissertations.
Think of LLBA as a sign of the times.

This is the official publication of the European
Association for Logic, Language, and Information. The
scope of the journal is the logical and computational
foundations of natural, formal, and programming
languages, as well as the different forms of human and
mechanized inference. It covers the logical, linguistic,
and information-theoretic parts of the cognitive sciences.
Examples of main subareas are Intensional Logics
including Dynamic Logic; Nonmonotonic Logic and Belief
Revision; Constructive Logics; Complexity Issues in
Logic and Linguistics; Theoretical Problems of Logic
Programming and Resolution; Categorial Grammar and
Type Theory; Generalized Quantification; Information-
Oriented Theories of Semantic Structure like Situation
Semantics, Discourse Representation Theory, and
Dynamic Semantics; Connectionist Models of Logical
and Linguistic Structures. The emphasis is on the
theoretical aspects of these areas. The purpose of the
journal is to act as a forum for researchers interested in
the theoretical foundations of the above subjects and
their interdisciplinary connections, with an emphasis on
general ideas increasing coherence.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9297194">
Manuscxripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.959245">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9865423125">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.

Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. to the Editor: category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.

A European chapter was in 1982. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented.
