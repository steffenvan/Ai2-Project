Offering an inquiry into the nature of language from the
perspective of computing, Computers and Human Language
synthesizes recent research in linguistics, computer science, and
experimental psychology as it explores the major computational
approaches to language, especially the modeling of processes by
which language is comprehended.
Among the topics considered are the computationally symbolic
basis of language, lexicons as repositories of information,
automated text processing, phonology, phototactics, speech
synthesis and the persisting challenge of continuous speech,
transformational grammars and their successors, linguistic and
conceptual approaches to sentence meaning, and discourse
coherence and plan-based bridging inferences. The book also
explores such up-to-the-minute subjects as neurally-inspired
computing, parsing and psychological plausibility, the
controversial representation hypothesis, and the ramifications of
discourse &amp;quot;focus.&amp;quot; With its clear, engaging style and gradual,
systematic exposition, Computers and Human Language makes the
fast-moving world of computational linguistics readily accessible
to students.

The ACL-MIT Series will offer books of high quality in the field of
natural language processing, including human and machine speech
production and understanding. It will cover a wide range of topics,
both theoretical and applied, which should interest researchers not
only in computational linguistics, but also in computer science and in
formal linguistics.
The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, research
monographs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of high quality
papers with clear unifying themes compiled under the editorship of
distinguished researchers.
The MIT Press publishes the ACL journal, Computational Linguis-
tics. The Press also has a strong list in formal linguistics, and pub-
lishes the journal, Linguistic Inquiry.

Vol. 3. Pieter de Haan: Postmodifying Clauses in the English Noun Phrase. A
Corpus-Based Study. Amsterdam/Atlanta GA 1989. 252 pp.
ISBN: 90-5183-123-4. Hfl. 75,—/US-$ 37.50
The study aims at a description of the most important characteristics of
postmodifying clauses (PMCs ) in the English noun phrase (NP). The author
discusses these, and the relationships obtaining among them, on the basis of
an examination of a corpus of English texts. The first two chapters are
devoted to a detailed description of the structure of the NP more generally,
and the PMC in particular. Both finite and non-finite clauses are discussed.
The emphasis is on such matters as clause patterns in the PMC, type and
function of the linkword, type and function of the NP, and type, form and
position of the PMC.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994465">
Manuscripts to Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or
A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an
informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact
the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.956377">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.797422263157895">
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational
linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper
depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is
the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of
the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject matter.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not
copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any
version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such
publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper
tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by
all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary
under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results
of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical
correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is
reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.
The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:

<abstract confidence="0.946767">Offering an inquiry into the nature of language from the of computing, and Human Language synthesizes recent research in linguistics, computer science, and experimental psychology as it explores the major computational approaches to language, especially the modeling of processes by which language is comprehended. Among the topics considered are the computationally symbolic basis of language, lexicons as repositories of information, automated text processing, phonology, phototactics, speech synthesis and the persisting challenge of continuous speech, transformational grammars and their successors, linguistic and conceptual approaches to sentence meaning, and discourse coherence and plan-based bridging inferences. The book also explores such up-to-the-minute subjects as neurally-inspired computing, parsing and psychological plausibility, the controversial representation hypothesis, and the ramifications of discourse &amp;quot;focus.&amp;quot; With its clear, engaging style and gradual, exposition, and Human Language the fast-moving world of computational linguistics readily accessible to students.

<abstract confidence="0.969546">The ACL-MIT Series will offer books of high quality in the field of natural language processing, including human and machine speech production and understanding. It will cover a wide range of topics, both theoretical and applied, which should interest researchers not only in computational linguistics, but also in computer science and in formal linguistics. The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, research monographs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of high quality papers with clear unifying themes compiled under the editorship of distinguished researchers.</abstract>
