Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999977454545454">
We propose a comprehensive theory of code-
mixed discourse, encompassing equivalence-
point and insertional code-switching, palin-
dromic constructions and lexical borrowing.
The starting point is a production model
of code-switching accounting for empirical
observations about switch-point distribution
(the equivalence constraint), well-formedness of
monolingual fragments, conservation of con-
stituent structure and lack of constraint be-
tween successive switch points, without invok-
ing any &amp;quot;code-switching grammar&amp;quot;. Code-
switched sentence production makes alternate
reference to two virtual monolingual sentences,
one in each language, and is based on conser-
vative conditions on language labeling of con-
stituents, together with a constraint against
real-time &amp;quot;look-ahead&amp;quot; from one code-switch to
the next. Selective weakening of model condi-
tions can produce (i) the type of palindromic
(or portmanteau) construction occasionally oc-
curring e.g., in switches between prepositional
and postpositional languages, (ii) the switch-
ing by &amp;quot;insertion&amp;quot; of very specific kinds of con-
stituent reported e.g., for French noun phrases
in switching with Arabic and, most important,
(iii) lexical borrowing. Borrowing can create
ambiguity as to language membership of sen-
tence items, but the model predicts where this
can be resolved, and the confirmation of these
predictions, based on empirical studies of inflec-
tional morphology, validates key aspects of the
model.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.952288622222222">
Communities of bilinguals tend to evolve a con-
versational mode where elements of both lan-
guages appear in the same interaction and even
in the same sentence despite the fact that all
participants may be competent in either of the
two languages. Whether this mode is used in
preference to monolingual discourse depends on
the type of interaction, the participants, the
subject of conversation and many other fac-
tors. The grammatical nature of code-mixed
discourse, however, tends to be very specific
to the community and varies widely among
bilingual communities, even among communi-
ties which share the same pair of languages.
Empirical research has isolated four clearly dis-
tinct processes which may be responsible for
mixing to different extents in different commu-
nities — code-switching, nonce borrowing, spe-
cialized incorporation and interference. None
of these processes requires the deformation, al-
teration or convergence of either of the two con-
stituent languages at the syntactic, lexical, mor-
phological, phonological, or semantic levels at
the moment the mixing occurs. Except for code-
switching, however, they may all lead in the long
term to lexical expansion in one or both of the
languages.
This paper is a contribution to a coherent for-
mal account of code-mixing which integrates all
of these processes&apos;, though only code-switching
and borrowing will be considered here. This
is based on a series of empirical studies which
now allows us to distinguish between them
structurally and quantitatively. Our starting
point will be a recent formal characterization
of a equivalence-point code-switching (Sankoff,
&apos;The analysis of code-mixing is a controversial sub-
ject with respect to several aspects: Is all code-mixing
— borrowing, switching, interference — really the same
process? Do languages involved in code-mixing tend to
converge syntactically? Are patterns of code-mixing pre-
dictable or explicable by theories of (monolingual) gram-
mar? We assume a negative response to all these ques-
tions and refer to the literature for more detailed discus-
sion.

code-switching mechanisms, and finally to lexi-
cal borrowing, the most frequent type of code-
mixing.
1 Code-switching
1.1 &amp;quot;The facts&amp;quot;
The modern motivation for studying code-
switching was initially to explain the obser-
vation that in bilingual communities, speakers
tend to switch from one language to another in-
trasententially at certain syntactic boundaries
and not at others (Gumperz &amp; Hernandez,
1969). The first general explanation to account
for this distribution was Poplack&apos;s (1978, 1980)
argument that switching should be favored at
the kinds of syntactic boundaries which occur
in both languages, thus avoiding word order
that might seem unnatural according to one
or both grammars: the equivalence constraint
(see also Lipski, 1977; Pfaff, 1979). Despite
criticism of this approach (Rivas, 1981; Wool-
ford, 1983; Di Sciullo et al., 1986; Pandit, 1990;
Myers-Scotton, 1993; Belazi et al., 1994; Ma-
hootian &amp; Santorini, 1994), it has been suc-
cessfully used to account for code-switching in
Spanish-English (Poplack, 1978,1980), Finnish-
English (Poplack et al., 1987b), Arabic-French
(Nait M&apos;Barek &amp; Sankoff, 1988), Tamil-English
(Sankoff et al., 1990), Fongbe-French (Meechan
&amp; Poplack, 1995), Wolof-French (Poplack &amp;
Meechan, 1995), Igbo-English (Eze, 1997) and
many other bilingual communities.
Other fundamental facts about code-switched
sentences include the well-formedness of mono-
lingual fragments within such sentences — true
whether a fragment constitutes a complete con-
stituent or stretches across two or more (possi-
bly incomplete) constituents, the conservation
of constituent structure, and the unpredictability
of switching — even if we can determine where
a code-switch can occur and where it cannot,
there is no way of knowing in advance for any
site whether a switch will occur there or not. In
particular, if a switch occurs at some point in
a sentence, this does not constrain any poten-
tial site(s) later in the sentence either to contain
another switch or not to — there are no forced
switches.
We do not assume that the mechanisms of
switching from one language to another can be
deduced entirely from the general principles of
monolingual grammars2. Thus we do not an-
alyze the distribution of intrasentential switch
points in terms of a grammar of any of the
types ordinarily used for accounting for single
languages, but by means of a left-to-right pro-
cess that refers to two well-formed monolingual
sentences (i.e. each satisfying the constraints
of an &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; monolingual grammar for one
of the two languages) in producing monolingual
sentence fragments and in evaluating potential
switch points between these fragments.
Our model is based on the assumption that
bilinguals are fully competent in their two lan-
guages, that there is no convergence of the two
monolingual codes even during bilingual dis-
course, and that a code-switched sentence con-
sists of fragments of two monolingual sentences
(each one a translation of the other) pieced to-
gether. This is done first through an other-
wise unconstrained production model that sim-
ply copies part of one monolingual process fol-
lowed by part of the other in such a way that
constituent structure is conserved. The result-
ing process satisfies neither equivalence nor un-
predictability. By adding two very simple rules
for labeling some constituents according to their
language, the existence of a consistent labeling
— which can be easily monitored during real-
time linear production — turns out to guaran-
tee both equivalence and, for most situations,
unpredictability.
9 2While formal theories of grammar may well account
for monolingual language in terms of general linguistic
principles, there is no reason to believe that processes
which juxtapose two languages can be explained in ex-
actly the same way. The reasons implicit or explicit in
attempts to do so have to do with explanatory economy,
either of individual linguistic competence or of linguistic
theories. This seems specious since both are based on a
notion of a &amp;quot;hard-wired&amp;quot; human linguistic faculty evolv-
ing in prehistoric monolingualism. Experience in widely
diverse speech communities suggests instead that code-
mixing strategies, including code-switching, evolve in the
life-time of particular communities, are only partly de-
pendent on linguistic typology of the two languages and
exhibit widely different patterns of adapting monolingual
resources for incorporating linguistic innovation.

1.3 Hierarchy and linearity.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986677419355">
That monolingual fragments are not co-
extensive with entire constituents is problem-
atic for any model relying on hierarchical re-
lations for deciding well-formedness, since such
models are designed primarily to ensure well-
formedness of entire constituents, monolingual
or bilingual. They cannot ensure that adja-
cent same-language parts of neighboring con-
stituents are compatible (i.e. yield a well-
formed fragment when juxtaposed), since these
parts may not even be in the same language as
the rest of the constituents that contain them
(Muysken, 1995). For example, an earlier model
(Sankoff &amp; Mainville, 1986), using the context-
free grammars of two languages to account for
code-switched sentences satisfying the equiv-
alence constraint, could not ensure the well-
formedness of monolingual fragments, for the
very reason Muysken has pointed out.
This problem is at the core of the conflict be-
tween hierarchical and linear modes of explana-
tion. We will resolve it by ascribing ultimate
responsibility for the well-formedness of mono-
lingual fragments to production-level processes.
These fragments, arbitrary substrings of pre-
constructed well-formed monolingual sentences,
are pieced together during linear production in
a way which corresponds to the other general
observations about code-switching and which is
essentially neutral with respect to theories of
monolingual grammar.

1.4 The syntactic model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.896593701492538">
We are interested in seeing how two hierarchi-
cally structured languages resolve their word-
order differences during intrasentential code-
switching, without the confounding effects of
other linguistic phenomena. Thus we will con-
struct a model where the only differences be-
tween two languages have to do with word
order and the (phonological) form of lexical
items, and work out the logical consequences
for code-switching of various assumptions and
constraints on the production of bilingual sen-
tences. Linearity and hierarchy are the key
structural aspects here3, and the simplest class
&apos;In focusing on the relationship between word order
and hierarchy, we are choosing a model not adapted to
the treatment of tags and moveable elements such as
many adverbials (whose &amp;quot;switchability&amp;quot; is uncontrover-
of recursive grammars accommodating these
properties is that of context-free grammars.
Consider a context-free grammar consisting
of a set C of &amp;quot;categories&amp;quot; or non-terminal sym-
bols, including one distinguished symbol s (for
&amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot;); a set of terminal symbols T (&amp;quot;lex-
ical slots&amp;quot;), none of which are also in C, a lex-
icon L which is basically a set of words and an
indication of the kind of lexical slot each word
can fill, and a set of rewrite rules R of form
c vi • • vn where c is a symbol in C, and the
string on the right hand side vi • • • vn consists
of one or more symbols in T or C. A sentence
is derived by writing s, then rewriting s by the
string ui • • • urn on the right hand side of any
rule in R of form s —+ ui • • • um, then rewrit-
ing any ui which is non-terminal by some rule
of form ui -4 w1 • • • wp and so on. Whenever a
lexical slot appears in the string it can be filled
with words of the appropriate category from L.
When there are no more non-terminal symbols
(and R must be such that this is always possi-
ble), the derivation stops, and the current string
is just a sentence generated by the grammar.
We will make use of phrase structure tree rep-
resentation for sentences and their constituents.
Each symbol appearing in the derivation is rep-
resented by a node of the tree; it dominates
the constituent of which it is the highest node,
and may be used to represent that constituent.
(Each terminal node is itself a constituent.)
Note that the words in each constituent form
a (contiguous) substring of the sentence. We de-
fine these, and all other contiguous substrings of
a well-formed sentence string to be well-formed
fragments.
In order to speak of code-switching between
two different grammars, it is necessary to have
some connection between the categories of one
and the categories of the other4. We make
sial), nor of remote relationships such as discontinuous
constituents, internal co-reference, etc., whose effects on
code-switching, if any, have never been systematically
documented. On the other hand, context-sensitive phe-
nomena such as subcategorization (Bentahila &amp; Davies,
1983), cliticization or certain deletion processes also es-
cape the scope of context-free modeling, as do other null
elements, agreement rules and other features which may,
in particular communities, be important to understand-
ing switch sites (Muysken, 1995).

the strong assumptions of lexical translatability
and categorial congruence, meaning that there
is a one-to-one correspondence between the lex-
icon LA of language A and the lexicon LB of
language B, though the words are all recog-
nizable as coming from one language or the
other. We use the same categories C and lex-
ical slots T for both languages. Furthermore
we assume grammatical congruence: there is a
one-to-one connection between the rulesRA of
language A and RB of language B — if RA
contains a rule c v1. • • vn, then RB must
contain a rule c 1.4 • • • un, where each sym-
bol in v1 • • • vn has its counterpart in u1 • • • un,
and vice-versa, though the order of the terms
in one string will not in general correspond to
the order of the terms in the other. Finally,
for convenience, we will assume fixed word or-
der, that is if c —4 vi- • • vn in a given grammar,
then there may be other rules rewriting C in
that grammar, but none where the right hand
side contains exactly the same set of symbols
To simplify our presentation in this article,
we do not allow ambiguity in our grammars.
Not only must each monolingual sentence be
derivable in exactly one way, but each rule may
contain any one symbol only once on its right
hand side. These conditions may be relaxed, as
long as there is a way of identifying correspond-
ing symbols in corresponding rules in the two
grammars.
In comparing the structure of two sentences,
we say that they have the same constituent
structure if there is a one-to-one correspondence
between their constituents such that if x in one
sentence corresponds to y in the other, then the
(unordered) set of subconstituents of x corre-
sponds to the set of subconstituents of y.
The consequences of our assumptions are
summarized in:
Theorem 1 5 Every sentence in language A
has a unique counterpart in language B with
the same constituent structure and whose lexical
items are translations of those in the sentence
of language A.
Examples (1a,b) are two (fictitious) sentences
in English and French which we may imagine to
be counterparts of each other according to some
15Proofs of all theorems are given in Sankoff (1998)
grammatical analysis of the two languages, in
the sense of Theorem 1:
Despite differences in word order, the con-
stituent structure is identical and the lexical
items are word-for-word translations (without
quibbling about the questionable lexical status
of the reflexive clitic and the genitive particle
and the somewhat different internal structure
of determiner in the PP).

of the other, and so on, without using any word
(or its translation) more than once, until every
lexical element (or its translation) has been used
up.
The idea of using virtual sentences is an ex-
tension of concepts implicit in Poplack&apos;s origi-
nal discovery (1978, 1980) of the importance of
equivalence sites to code-switching and is what
distinguishes it from attempts to account for
code-switching using purely distributional data
— examples of sentences thought to be either
well-formed or not. It implies the comparison
of the sentence actually produced with what
&amp;quot;could have been said&amp;quot; in either of the monolin-
gual modes. Though the comparative data are
of course not directly accessible, since only one
sentence is uttered, controlled inference about
unrealized possibilities is consistent with rigor-
ous methodology (cf the notion of the linguistic
variable (Labov, 1969; Sankoff, 1988).
Postulating two complete virtual sentences,
however, is an analytical convenience. All that
would really be needed in a more realistic (and
complicated) analysis, are the parts of each
sentence that are actually used plus some ad-
ditional details about the constituent within
which a switch occurs. The consequences of
this device, and its realism, lie largely in the
way the monolingual fragments are produced
&amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot; by the monolingual grammars, how-
ever these grammars are conceived in theory.
Indeed, we need not refer to any particular lin-
guistic theory for this aspect.
The above process produces not only plausi-
ble code-switched sentences such as those in (2),
but also any combination of elements in any or-
der as in (3).
(3) de grand-maman I the with I remarquable

To arrive at an empirically and conceptually
satisfactory model, we must add constraints.
The first constraint is motivated by the empiri-
cal observation that each monolingual fragment
in bilingual discourse tends to be well-formed
in its lexifier language. We will assume that the
production of the sentence starts with a word in
(either) one of the virtual sentences, and copies
successive words from left to right in that sen-
tence without skipping any until there is a code-
switch to some word in the other virtual sen-
tence. From this point in the other virtual sen-
tence, production continues from left to right,
and so on. When the left-to-right production
arrives at a word (such as se after freres in ex-
ample 4) which has already been used in the
current or the other language (also some of af-
ter with) or at the end of one of the virtual sen-
tences, there must be a switch to the other vir-
tual sentence or, if all the words have been used
(after remarkable), the production must stop.

Theorem 2 The monolingual fragments in a
code-switched sentence produced by left-to-right
copying are well-formed.
The left-to-right assumption ensures that mono-
lingual fragments are well-formed, as illustrated
in (4), as well as (2). By itself, however, it
does not constrain how the alternating frag-
ments in one language and the other are related;
indeed it allows them to be juxtaposed in any
order, as long as the fragment languages alter-
nate; sister elements in the same constituent in
a virtual sentence may find themselves remote
from each other in the code-switched sentence,
as with remarkable and savon in example (4).
As mentioned in Section 1.1, however, empiri-
cal research confirms that constituent structure,
insofar as content and embedding or nesting re-
lations are concerned, is conserved even if the
constituent contains a code-switch.
To conform to this observation, we make a
second assumption, that once the production
process enters or switches into a constituent,
it must exhaust all the lexical slots in the con-
stituent, in one language or both, before return-
ing into a higher-level constituent or entering a
sister constituent. In other words, each time it
enters a deeper, or more nested, subconstituent,
it cannot exit from it until that subconstituent
is exhausted. Note that this assumption is in-
dependent of whether or not the production fol-
lows the left-to-right process described above, so
that the sentence (5) satisfies nested first, but
not left-to-right.

The nested first condition and the left-to-right
assumption are independent, in the sense that
neither implies the other, as is clear from (4)
and (5). Neither excludes the other, and to-
gether, as in (6) and (2), they produce code-
switched sentences with well-formed monolin-

1.6 The language of constituents and
subconstituents.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992032452380953">
The model in Section 1.5, though it produces
sentences like those in (2) and (6) with some de-
sirable properties, is not complete. With only
the two conditions, certain configurations may
occur, such as those in (6), that are clearly
unrealistic. For example, if the monolingual
fragment being copied includes a word which
must be positioned finally in a constituent, like
freres in (6b), and if the words of the con-
stituent in one virtual sentence or the other
have not yet been used up, then an immediate
code-switch, to the in this instance, is obliga-
tory to satisfy nested first — the monolingual
fragment cannot continue, even though it may
have a natural continuation into another con-
stituent. This, and other instances of forced
code-switching, are clearly not phenomena ob-
served in real bilingual discourse.
Another type of construction not found in
natural bilingual corpora but permitted in the
simple production model might include a code-
switched sentence which begins with a fragment
of the virtual sentence in language A which
would never occur in sentence-initial position in
monolingual discourse in language A, such as se
lavent in (6a). More generally, if there are sev-
eral sister subconstituents in a constituent, they
may be permuted in any order, as long as there
is a switch between each adjacent pair. Still an-
other anomalous output from this model, even
if the two monolingual grammars contrast com-
pletely, is a code-switch between every adjacent
pair of words in the sentence.
Thus the output of the production process as
is hitherto formulated seems unduly constrained
from the production point of view (by forcing
switches) and not constrained enough from the
perspective of the output structure. We thus
come to the main point of this section: short of
the equivalence constraint itself, can we moti-
vate some constraint to account for the obser-
vation that switching occurs almost exclusively
at equivalence points (notion to be formalized
in Section 1.6.1) and virtually all equivalence
points seem to be eligible switch points? And
can this be done in such a way that during pro-
duction, the model speaker avoids any switch-
ing which will obligatorily require compensatory
switches later on in the sentence construction
(switch planning or forcing)? Furthermore, can
we do this without referring to facts of partic-
ular languages, properties of particular gram-
matical categories, or even the mechanisms of
particular theories of monolingual grammar?
Our approach to this problem is to postu-
late a limited degree of structural monitoring.
Monitoring the monolingual fragments for well-
formedness is uncontroversial, and we need not
enter into the details. What we propose for
monitoring at the switch points is the &amp;quot;language
label&amp;quot; of the constituent in which the switch oc-
curs and of its immediate subconstituents.
We first ask: what parts of the constituent
structure of the code-switched sentence may be
with certainty ascribed to one language or the
other only, and hence should be labeled accord-
ingly? Certainly (i) all terminal symbols — lexi-
cal slots — are labeled according to whether the
word filling the slot comes from LA or LB, since
all words are identifiable as to their language, by
definition in our model of congruent grammars.
(ii) At the constituent level, any constituent, all
of whose immediate subconstituents have the
same label, should itself have this label. Any-
thing else would be inconsistent. We will pro-
pose a third criterion for labeling constituents,
but we first prove the following:
Theorem 4 Any non-terminal node carrying a
label must have at least one immediate descen-
dant node which has this same label or is un-
labeled, and one descendant (possibly a lexical
slot) which has the same label.
Different instantiations of this model may ac-
tually specify that certain sub constituents &amp;quot;in-

herit&amp;quot; the label — in one theory the determiner
may inherit the label of the noun phrase, in an-
other theory it may be the noun itself.
Requirement (ii) depends on constituent con-
tent, but not on constituent order, so that it
applies meaningfully to any sentence satisfying
nested first such as (5) or (6b). The labeling of
(6b) is illustrated in (7).

To constrain the order, we are motivated to
try to exclude situations such as a declarative
sentence which begins with a well-formed verb
phrase entirely in English followed by a subject
noun phrase in another language. More gener-
ally, (iii) any sub constituent which is out of rank
order position among its sister subconstituents
according to one of the languages, must receive
the label of the other language. For example, if
the languages A and B are SVO and VSO, re-
spectively, and the code-switched sentence has
order VSO, then the labeling should be VBSBO;
if the code-switched sentence were SOV, then
condition (iii) could not be satisfied, since 0 is
out of order according to both languages, as is
the V.
If conditions (i)-(iii), all of which are well-
motivated, cannot be simultaneously satisfied,
the code-switched sentence cannot be consid-
ered well-formed. Thus in our hypothetical
example with a sentence-initial English verb
phrase, requirements (ii) and (iii) conflict, so
the sentence is not well-formed. And in exam-
ple (7) condition (iii) cannot be satisfied with
respect to any of the categories lexicalized by
freres, the, savon, remarquable, wash and them-
selves, nor the PP node — according to the ex-
tremely constrained grammars responsible for
examples (1a,b). On the other hand, each of
examples (2a,b,c,d) satisfy all of the conditions
(i)-(iii).
All that a speaker monitors is the language
label of the constituent in which a potential
switch occurs and that of its subconstituents.
No additional labeling is warranted within
this framework, though other treatments of
code-switching all have their own particular way
of assigning a label to each and every con-
stituent (Rivas, 1981; Woolford, 1983; Joshi,
1985; Di Sciullo et al., 1986; Myers-Scotton,
1993). In particular, we would claim that there
is no conceptual justification or need for postu-
lating an underlying (or &amp;quot;matrix&amp;quot;) language for
the entire sentence itself when this is not moti-
vated by criteria (ii) and (iii).

In the string of words which constitute a code-
switched sentence in our model, there is no
problem in identifying where a fragment in lan-
guage A stops and one in language B starts. On
the constituent level, however, it is not as ob-
vious where this switch should be located and
sometimes even whether or not there is an inter-
constituent switch, as in (8).

This is an example of string-level code-switching
with and without corresponding constituent-
level switches. The rule N13.-4 ADJ+NP in En-
glish and NP--* NP+ADJ in French results in
the lowest NP being labeled E, by requirement
(iii). The higher NPs, the VP, the object NP
and the S are labeled E, and the PP labeled
F because all of their subconstituents are (re-
quirement (ii)). The code-switch between Duke
and de is also a constituent-level switch between
Duke and the PP, but the switch between Lor-
raine and had is not reflected by a switch be-
tween the highest NP and its sister VP since
they are both labeled E.
In general, what constitutes a code-switch be-
tween two adjacent sister constituents? The
only reasonable answer is that one constituent is
labeled A and the other B. What happens if two
differently labeled sister constituents are sepa-
rated by one or more unlabeled constituents?
Once again it is clear that there has been a code-

switch at the constituent level, but the site can-
not be pinned down, other than by saying that
it occurred in the interval between the two la-
beled constituents. Note that there also must
be switches at some lower levels within each of
the intervening unlabeled constituents; other-
wise they could not be unlabeled, by criterion
(ii).
We can now state the equivalence constraint.
Consider the corresponding rules for ordering
the n subconstituents of a given constituent in
language A and language B. If the sets of the
first i symbols on the right-hand side of the rules
are different in the two grammars (and hence
the set of the last n — i symbols are also differ-
ent, since the two rules are congruent), then the
equivalence constraint prohibits a code-switch
between the i-th and i + 1-st subconstituents.
Otherwise the boundary between the two sub-
constituents is an equivalence point and a code-
switch is permitted. In the case n = 2, this
reduces to the prohibition of a code-switch be-
tween the two subconstituents unless the two
languages order them in the same way.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996159">
1.7 Proof of the equivalence constraint.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997584535714286">
The production model in Section 1.5 and the
labeling rules in Section 1.6 ensure that mono-
lingual fragments are well-formed, constituent
structures are correct and that no constituent
labeled X appears within a higher constituent
in a rank order position not permitted in lan-
guage X. This does not mean that the equiv-
alence constraint holds. Consider for example
the rules c xyz and c -4 zyx in languages
A and B respectively. Then the model as it is
now constituted would permit the constituent
order xA yB zA , with two constituent-level code-
switches, both of which violate the equivalence
constraint. (cf Grandma&apos;s I remarquable I soap
or savon I remarkable I de grand-maman.)
In one important case, however, equivalence
always holds. Monolingual grammars have
binary constituent-subconstituent structure if
there are at most two symbols on the right-hand
side of every rule. Then the following holds:
Theorem 5 Given a well-formed code-switched
sentence where the monolingual grammars have
binary constituent-subconstituent structure. If
two sister subconstituents are labeled A and B,
respectively, the code-switch between them satis-
fies the equivalence constraint.
As we have seen, however, the theorem may not
hold if rules may have more than two terms
on their right-hand sides. The counter-example
shown above, for example, represents the inser-
tion of a language B subconstituent into an oth-
erwise language A constituent. This requires
two code-switches, one before and one after the
inserted subconstituent. If a code-mixing strat-
egy were to be based on the insertion of con-
stituents in this way, every code-switch before
an insertion would require the speaker to plan
for an appropriate second code-switch later on
in the sentence.
While many types of relatively complex for-
ward planning must be incorporated into mono-
lingual production models, the distribution of
code-switches in bilingual corpora is more con-
sistent with a hypothesis of the independence of
successive code-switches: no forced switches (or
no planning). Where a switch takes place in be-
tween two constituents, well-formedness of the
code-switched sentence cannot depend further
switches later on in the left-to-right order7.
Theorem 6 Given a well-formed code-switched
sentence. If two sister subconstituents are la-
beled A and B, respectively, and there is no la-
beled subconstituent between them, then under
no forced switches, there must be a code-switch
satisfying the equivalence constraint in the in-
terval between the labeled subconstituents.

ellative case-marked kidneysta and illative aor-

Tut it was from the kidney to the aorta.&apos;
The interesting aspect of this example is that to

our model. The same, highly bilingual, speaker
produced a similar example in (10).

Again, the inessive marker -ssa has the same
function as the English preposition at and only
one of them should have appeared, according to
our model.
This type of construction, involving the re-
dundant use of functionally identical words, is
rare — examples (9) and (10) are the only two
in the Finnish-English corpus — and, as can
be seen in (10), tends to evidence production-
level difficulties (hesitations, autocorrection,
etc.). Nishimura (1986) presents several simi-
lar examples involving adpositional phrases for
Japanese-English code-mixing.
It is also possible to find occasional instances
of redundant verb use in SVO/SOV mixing —
producing a SVOV structure. Examples (11)
and (12) below are drawn from the Tamil-
English code-mixing corpus of Sankoff et al.
(1990).

Precisely how does this violate the conditions
of our model, and can they be relaxed to ac-
commodate it? Clearly the first postulate vio-
lated (Section 1.5) is that the &amp;quot;...code-switched
sentence is produced by taking part of one of
[the virtual sentences], followed by part of the
other, and so on, without using any word (or
its translation) more than once, until every lex-
ical element (or its translation) has been used
up.&amp;quot; What if we changed the latter part of this
to &amp;quot;... and so on, until every lexical element
(and/or its translation) has been used once?&amp;quot;
This general extension allows for the use of any
element as well as its translation in the same
sentence. More limited extensions, where only
specified lexical classes may occur in both lan-
guages, would be more consistent with actual
speech behaviour.
With these kinds of changes, there is no dif-
ficulty in retaining the left-to-right and nested
first assumptions, as well as consituent label-
ing criteria (i) and (ii). Condition (iii), formu-
lated as it is in terms of the rank order of con-
stituents, must be worded differently to capture
the basic idea that a constituent is labeled ac-
cording to language A whenever it is out place
according to a rule of language B, and vice-
versa. &amp;quot;Out of place&amp;quot; can no longer be detected
by simply checking the rank order, but by ascer-
taining whether any sister constituent preced-
ing the candidate constituent is prohibited from
preceding it by the appropriate rule of language
B, and similarly for constituents following the
candidate constituent. An analogous procedure
can be used to verify the equivalence constraint.
Typically, one sister constituent of the re-
peated translated constituents will receive two
conflicting labelings from criterion (iii) in this
situation. The noun in the Finnish adpositional

phrase, the object in SVOV constructions, the
proposition complement of both the English and
Tamil verbs, all receive two labels this way. To
weaken the model in order to accept such sen-
tences, we must discard conflicting criterion (iii)
labelings due to &amp;quot;out of place&amp;quot; configurations
with respect to the repeated translated con-
stituent. Criteria (i) and (ii) still operate. The
equivalence constraint will not hold with respect
to this sister constituent, but can be verified
elsewhere.

2.2 Insertional code-switching.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999514">
In some bilingual communities, the code-mixing
mode of discourse may include the possibility of
inserting one specific type of constituent into
positions where it would not occur monolin-
gually. In the Tamil-English corpus in Section
2.1, examples (14) and (15), as well as (13), il-
lustrate the placement of an English proposition
preceding the Tamil propositional complemen-
tizer, instead of in its obligatory English posi-
tion following that.

It is important to note that in this commu-
nity this pattern is confined to the very par-
ticular category of propositional complements.
All other code-switches satisfy the equivalence
constraint; none of the numerous other word-
order conflicts between Tamil and English give
rise to an insertional code-switching possibility.
A different type of constituent insertion
has been characterized quantitatively by Nat
M&apos;Barek &amp; Sankoff (1988). This involves the
insertion, by bilingual Moroccans, of a full
French noun phrase, including determiners and
quantifiers, in all contexts where an Arabic
noun phrase would be appropriate. This in-
cludes, among other contexts, post-verbal sub-
jects as in (16), which are not possible in French.
feeling is treated as a loanword, for reasons discussed
in Section 3.
Determiner-initial French noun phrases also ap-
pear after demonstratives as in (17) and (18),
producing demonstrative-determiner sequences,
and after the indefinite waltd as in (18), produc-
ing determiner-determiner sequences, neither of
which is a French pattern.

The sentences we have shown containing ex-
amples of constituent insertion are all excluded
from the model based on the equivalence con-
straint. For example, the English propositional
complement preceding the Tamil complemen-
tizer nu would be labeled for Tamil by crite-
rion (iii) because of its non-English position,
but this would conflict with the English label
it would receive from criterion (ii) since it is
a normal English sentence containing only En-
glish lexical items. Similarly, the post-verbal
subject consisting entirely of a normal French
noun phrase receives conflicting labels from its
position corresponding to Arabic rules and from
its own constituent elements.
It must be stressed that not all bilingual com-
munities that develop code-mixing modes of dis-
course make use of constituent insertion; those
that do (e.g. Tamil-English or Arabic-French),
use it very sparingly in the sense that typically
only one type of constituent (English proposi-
tions or French noun phrases) may be inserted
in contexts (before nu, postverbally) where it
would not be found in monolingual discourse.
It is not difficult in this case to relax the
model conditions so that such sentences are per-
mitted. As in Section 2.1, the specified category
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997827">
17
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985225">
is simply allowed to escape labeling by crite-
rion (iii), and can be labeled by its own sub-
constituents (criterion (ii)). There is no dan-
ger that this will result in anomalous labeling
higher in the phrase structure, since a sister con-
stituent (the Tamil complementizer, the Ara-
bic verb) will already have the contrary label,
and the constituent containing them is thus pre-
vented from receiving a label by way of criterion
(ii). Note, however, that only those insertions
which are not in conflict with the fundamen-
tal production conditions left-to-right and most
nested can be considered well-formed. In addi-
tion, the equivalence constraint, wherever the
specified category is not one of the constituents
directly involved, still holds.

3 The borrowing process.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992">
The equivalence constraint formalized in Sec-
tion 1.6.1 has been verified as a general ten-
dency in several communities — Puerto Rican
Spanish and English in New York (Poplack,
1980), Finnish and English (Poplack et al.,
1987b), Tamil and English (Sankoff et al.,
1990), Wolof and French, and Fongbe and
French (Meechan &amp; Poplack, 1995; Poplack SE
Meechan, 1995), Igbo and English (Eze, 1997),
and others. However, there are actually rela-
tively few data on which it has been indepen-
dently tested, since most of the voluminous lit-
erature on code-switching, especially that on
insertional switching, is based on data which
represent, we would claim, lexical borrowing
(e.g. Eliasson, 1991; Mahootian &amp; Santorini,
1994; Backus, 1996). While code-switching es-
sentially involves the reconciliation of the word
orders of both languages, only the word-order
of the recipient language is pertinent to bor-
rowing. Thus attempts to understand code-
switching based on a mixture of borrowing and
true switching data are likely to be misleading.
In the model constructed above, the borrow-
ing process is not relevant. Loanwords, includ-
ing those are ad hoc, &amp;quot;nonce&amp;quot;, or momentary,
uses, are not excluded, but simply considered
to be syntactically integrated, i.e. to behave as
native lexical items with respect to word order.
How can this working hypothesis be validated?
In Sections 3.1 and 3.2, we demonstrate an an-
swer to this problem.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999123">
3.1 Properties of loanwords.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937">
Many loanwords have long histories in the re-
cipient language, are used by monolinguals (of-
ten with no consciousness of their foreign et-
ymology), are widespread and are accepted by
monolingual dictionaries and other linguistic ar-
biters. None of these non-structural character-
istics, however, are necessary to the borrowing
process. In many communities, bilinguals have
access to essentially the entire content-word lex-
icon of one language as potential loanwords
into the other, perhaps for a single usage only.
What is important is that when these words are
borrowed the structural linguistic characteris-
tics of their usage are the same as with estab-
lished loanwords. What are these characteris-
tics? Some of them are: integration into the
recipient language at the syntactic, morpholog-
ical, semantic and phonological levels, use as
a single item independent of other donor lan-
guage material, and restriction to nouns, verbs,
adjectives, etc., to the exclusion of determiners,
pronouns, prepositions and other grammatical
words.
Often, during the study of a bilingual cor-
pus, we discover a pattern of words from a spe-
cific lexical category in language A appearing
in mixed discourse in contexts where they seem
to violate the equivalence constraint, but when
considered as language B words, i.e. borrow-
ings, there is no violation, e.g. kidney in (9),
feeling in (15). Thus these words seem syntac-
tically integrated into language B. To confirm
their borrowed status, we verify the other prop-
erties of loanwords.
Phonological integration turns out to be an
unreliable indicator, for two reasons (cf Poplack
et al., 1987a). One is that bilinguals, in con-
trast to monolinguals, tend to be aware of the
etymology of loanwords and, in some commu-
nities, will often reflect this knowledge in their
pronunciation of borrowed items. Second, in
some communities, the learning context results
in phonologies for languages A and B which
converge in unpredictable and diverse ways from
speaker to speaker.
Semantic integration refers to a shift in func-
tion or meaning of a loanword from donor lan-
guage characteristics to recipient language char-
acteristics. This may often be documented for
established loanwords that have had time to
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999963181818182">
evolve within the host language, or for borrow-
ings between languages whose functional cate-
gories are structured very differently, but in gen-
eral, where bilingual borrowings are most fre-
quently from and into the category of nouns, the
criterion of semantic integration, though satis-
fied, may not always revealing.
The criterion of isolated occurrence of loan-
words in recipient language contexts is more
universal and is usually relatively easy to ap-
ply. The main difficulties come from compound
words and other multi-word forms whose status
as single lexical items is not always clear. Sta-
tistically, these should not constitute a major
problem. There is also the possibility of coin-
cidence. If nouns are often borrowed and ad-
jectives are often borrowed, then occasionally a
noun-adjective combination will appear to have
been borrowed together, when this is just the
result of chance. This will also be relatively
rare.
The lexical/grammatical (or content/ func-
tion) contrast is also useful. It is true that
among the world&apos;s languages, loanwords have on
occasion included prepositions, pronouns, de-
terminers, and other grammatical categories,
but these are exceptional, and the overwhelming
tendency is for borrowing, and especially one-
time borrowing by bilinguals, to affect nouns,
and to a lesser extent, verbs, adjectives and ad-
verbs. Moreover, in specific communities, bilin-
gual borrowing may be focused on particular
categories more than in other communities, and
these patterns may be useful for analytical pur-
poses.
Finally, it is the criterion of morphological in-
tegration which is of great interest. Loanwords,
established or momentary, are inflected exclu-
sively through recipient language morphological
rules. Insofar as such marking is non-null and is
different for language A and language B, words
borrowed from the former into the latter should
display exclusively language B inflectional mor-
phology.

red) objects appear. Examining these English-
origin nouns, we first note that these occur most
frequently in isolation, and occasionally as com-
pounds, or as familiar adjective-noun combina-
tions, but never preceded by English preposi-
tions, articles, quantifiers or demonstratives as
would frequently be the case if these were parts
of well-formed English fragments resulting from
code-switching.
Second, whereas the preponderance of prever-
bal native Tamil objects are actually pronouns,
from 45-70% depending on the case, no English
pronouns whatsoever appear in this context, as
would be expected from borrowings, but not if
these were code-switches into English fragments
— which would normally include at least the oc-
casional pronoun.
Third, it is the inflectional morphology on
these nouns which is the most revealing. They
either have null morphology or Tamil inflec-
tions. Since in Tamil the numerically fre-
quent accusatives and datives are prescribed to
take non-null case-marking, we examine mark-
ing rates quantitatively. In fact, as in Table
1, many (non-pronominal) Tamil forms are un-
marked, especially accusatives. The English-
origin forms show remarkably parallel rates, es-
pecially when the accusative-dative contrast is
considered. This morphological integration into
Tamil is exactly what would be expected of bor-
rowings, and certainly not of well-formed En-
glish fragments produced by code-switching.
In summary, the criteria of syntactic integra-
tion, isolation, lexical category, and morpholog-
ical integration all confirm the loanword status
of the preverbal English-origin nouns, and jus-
tify our considering them as Tamil nouns for
the purposes of applying our model of code-

statement in Theorem 1 has to be modified to
take this into account, but this leads to no diffi-
culty. We presume of course that the borrowed
word in B can be distinguished from its &amp;quot;ety-
mological&amp;quot; origin in A by the tests and criteria
illustrated in Section 3.2.

The core of this work is our model of
equivalence-point code-switching. This avoids
issues of grammatical theory by focusing on
the &amp;quot;real-time&amp;quot; production of a code-mixed sen-
tence drawing on the output of two monolingual
grammars.
Our model is built on an earlier formulation of
the equivalence constraint (Sankoff Sz Mainville,
1986). It is the production aspect here, how-
ever, that allows us to achieve the all-important
well-formedness of monolingual fragments, not
strictly guaranteed in the earlier work, and to
model the essential unpredictability of code-
switching. The present version (Sankoff, 1998)
has a more economical protocol for constituent
labeling and a more complete account of the co-
incidence (or lack thereof) between word-level
switching and constituent-level switching. We
have shown here how to weaken the strong con-
ditions leading to Theorems 5 and 6 to account
for other types of code-switching that have been
reported.
We have allowed some degree of asymmetry
in the model. Borrowing can be unidirectional
with respect to specific categories. The same
is true for constituent insertion. Further de-
velopment will require weakening the one-to-
one correspondence of the sets of rules, and of
the grammatical and lexical categories of the
two languages. For example, the use of spe-
cialized incorporation devices, like inflection-
carrying dummy verbs, or techniques for mark-
ing borrowed adverbs, typically belong to one
language and not the other.
We have not treated the topic of interference
in this presentation. Interference differs from
borrowing in several respects, in particular on
the level of intentionality — interference is more
likely to be avoided or corrected by speakers,
and is more likely to show up in communities
where the domain of monolingualism, and fre-
quency of use of the affected language are re-
stricted. Nevertheless, interference has interest-
ing consequences for our model in that it tends
to affect pre-sentential discourse markers, tags,
conjunctions, prepositions and other grammat-
ical morphemes rather than lexical items as is
the case for loanwords. Both borrowing and in-
terference can lead to the long-term establish-
ment of lexical items, so that when interference
is frequent, the distinction between the two be-
comes of interest.

<abstract confidence="0.999247294117647">We propose a comprehensive theory of codemixed discourse, encompassing equivalencepoint and insertional code-switching, palindromic constructions and lexical borrowing. The starting point is a production model of code-switching accounting for empirical observations about switch-point distribution (the equivalence constraint), well-formedness of monolingual fragments, conservation of constituent structure and lack of constraint between successive switch points, without invoking any &amp;quot;code-switching grammar&amp;quot;. Codeswitched sentence production makes alternate reference to two virtual monolingual sentences, one in each language, and is based on conservative conditions on language labeling of constituents, together with a constraint against real-time &amp;quot;look-ahead&amp;quot; from one code-switch to the next. Selective weakening of model conditions can produce (i) the type of palindromic (or portmanteau) construction occasionally occurring e.g., in switches between prepositional and postpositional languages, (ii) the switching by &amp;quot;insertion&amp;quot; of very specific kinds of constituent reported e.g., for French noun phrases in switching with Arabic and, most important, (iii) lexical borrowing. Borrowing can create ambiguity as to language membership of sentence items, but the model predicts where this can be resolved, and the confirmation of these predictions, based on empirical studies of inflectional morphology, validates key aspects of the model.</abstract>

All that a speaker monitors is the language label of the constituent in which a potential switch occurs and that of its subconstituents. No additional labeling is warranted within this framework, though other treatments of code-switching all have their own particular way of assigning a label to each and every constituent (Rivas, 1981; Woolford, 1983; Joshi, 1985; Di Sciullo et al., 1986; Myers-Scotton, 1993).

Though the comparative data are of course not directly accessible, since only one sentence is uttered, controlled inference about unrealized possibilities is consistent with rigorous methodology (cf the notion of the linguistic variable (Labov, 1969; Sankoff, 1988). Postulating two complete virtual sentences, however, is an analytical convenience. All that would really be needed in a more realistic (and complicated) analysis, are the parts of each sentence that are actually used plus some additional details about the constituent within which a switch occurs. The consequences of this device, and its realism, lie largely in the way the monolingual fragments are produced &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot; by the monolingual grammars, however these grammars are conceived in theory.

That monolingual fragments are not coextensive with entire constituents is problematic for any model relying on hierarchical relations for deciding well-formedness, since such models are designed primarily to ensure wellformedness of entire constituents, monolingual or bilingual. They cannot ensure that adjacent same-language parts of neighboring constituents are compatible (i.e. yield a wellformed fragment when juxtaposed), since these parts may not even be in the same language as the rest of the constituents that contain them (Muysken, 1995). For example, an earlier model (Sankoff &amp; Mainville, 1986), using the contextfree grammars of two languages to account for code-switched sentences satisfying the equivalence constraint, could not ensure the wellformedness of monolingual fragments, for the very reason Muysken has pointed out. This problem is at the core of the conflict between hierarchical and linear modes of explanation. We will resolve it by ascribing ultimate responsibility for the well-formedness of monolingual fragments to production-level processes.

On the other hand, context-sensitive phenomena such as subcategorization (Bentahila &amp; Davies, 1983), cliticization or certain deletion processes also escape the scope of context-free modeling, as do other null elements, agreement rules and other features which may, in particular communities, be important to understanding switch sites (Muysken, 1995). 4In natural languages, such correspondences will usually be imperfect (Muysken, 1995), but this is peripheral to our interest in word order. 10 the strong assumptions of lexical translatability and categorial congruence, meaning that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the lexicon LA of language A and the lexicon LB of language B, though the words are all recognizable as coming from one language or the other.

On the other hand, each of examples (2a,b,c,d) satisfy all of the conditions (i)-(iii). All that a speaker monitors is the language label of the constituent in which a potential switch occurs and that of its subconstituents. No additional labeling is warranted within this framework, though other treatments of code-switching all have their own particular way of assigning a label to each and every constituent (Rivas, 1981; Woolford, 1983; Joshi, 1985; Di Sciullo et al., 1986; Myers-Scotton, 1993).

In the string of words which constitute a codeswitched sentence in our model, there is no problem in identifying where a fragment in language A stops and one in language B starts.

On the other hand, each of examples (2a,b,c,d) satisfy all of the conditions (i)-(iii). All that a speaker monitors is the language label of the constituent in which a potential switch occurs and that of its subconstituents. No additional labeling is warranted within this framework, though other treatments of code-switching all have their own particular way of assigning a label to each and every constituent (Rivas, 1981; Woolford, 1983; Joshi, 1985; Di Sciullo et al., 1986; Myers-Scotton, 1993).

It implies the comparison of the sentence actually produced with what &amp;quot;could have been said&amp;quot; in either of the monolingual modes. Though the comparative data are of course not directly accessible, since only one sentence is uttered, controlled inference about unrealized possibilities is consistent with rigorous methodology (cf the notion of the linguistic variable (Labov, 1969; Sankoff, 1988). Postulating two complete virtual sentences, however, is an analytical convenience. All that would really be needed in a more realistic (and complicated) analysis, are the parts of each sentence that are actually used plus some additional details about the constituent within which a switch occurs. The consequences of this device, and its realism, lie largely in the way the monolingual fragments are produced &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot; by the monolingual grammars, however these grammars are conceived in theory.

This avoids issues of grammatical theory by focusing on the &amp;quot;real-time&amp;quot; production of a code-mixed sentence drawing on the output of two monolingual grammars. Our model is built on an earlier formulation of the equivalence constraint (Sankoff Sz Mainville, 1986). It is the production aspect here, however, that allows us to achieve the all-important well-formedness of monolingual fragments, not strictly guaranteed in the earlier work, and to model the essential unpredictability of codeswitching. The present version (Sankoff, 1998) has a more economical protocol for constituent labeling and a more complete account of the coincidence (or lack thereof) between word-level switching and constituent-level switching. We have shown here how to weaken the strong conditions leading to Theorems 5 and 6 to account for other types of code-switching that have been reported. We have allowed some degree of asymmetry in the model. Borrowing can be unidirectional with respect to specific categories. The same is true for constituent insertion. Further development will require weakening the one-toone correspondence of the sets of rules, a</context>

That monolingual fragments are not coextensive with entire constituents is problematic for any model relying on hierarchical relations for deciding well-formedness, since such models are designed primarily to ensure wellformedness of entire constituents, monolingual or bilingual. They cannot ensure that adjacent same-language parts of neighboring constituents are compatible (i.e. yield a wellformed fragment when juxtaposed), since these parts may not even be in the same language as the rest of the constituents that contain them (Muysken, 1995). For example, an earlier model (Sankoff &amp; Mainville, 1986), using the contextfree grammars of two languages to account for code-switched sentences satisfying the equivalence constraint, could not ensure the wellformedness of monolingual fragments, for the very reason Muysken has pointed out. This problem is at the core of the conflict between hierarchical and linear modes of explanation. We will resolve it by ascribing ultimate responsibility for the well-formedness of monolingual fragments to production-level processes. These fragments, arbitrary substrings of preconstructed well-formed monolingual sentences, are pieced together during linear produc</context>

Nishimura (1986) presents several similar examples involving adpositional phrases for Japanese-English code-mixing. It is also possible to find occasional instances of redundant verb use in SVO/SOV mixing — producing a SVOV structure. Examples (11) and (12) below are drawn from the TamilEnglish code-mixing corpus of Sankoff et al. (1990). (11) They gave me a research grant I kodutaa. gave-3p.-p1.-past &apos;They gave me a research grant.&apos; (12) I was talking to I oru orutanooda peesindu iruntein. one person-corn. talk-cont. be-lp.-sg.-past &apos;I was talking to a person.&apos; Still other examples from the same corpus combine redundant verb plus complementizer for propositional complements: (13) I think it&apos;s the European influence I nu ninaikirein. that think-lp.-sg.-pres. &apos;I think that its the European influence.&apos; Precisely how does this violate the conditions of our model, and can they be relaxed to accommodate it?

Note, however, that only those insertions which are not in conflict with the fundamental production conditions left-to-right and most nested can be considered well-formed. In addition, the equivalence constraint, wherever the specified category is not one of the constituents directly involved, still holds. 3 The borrowing process. The equivalence constraint formalized in Section 1.6.1 has been verified as a general tendency in several communities — Puerto Rican Spanish and English in New York (Poplack, 1980), Finnish and English (Poplack et al., 1987b), Tamil and English (Sankoff et al., 1990), Wolof and French, and Fongbe and French (Meechan &amp; Poplack, 1995; Poplack SE Meechan, 1995), Igbo and English (Eze, 1997), and others. However, there are actually relatively few data on which it has been independently tested, since most of the voluminous literature on code-switching, especially that on insertional switching, is based on data which represent, we would claim, lexical borrowing (e.g. Eliasson, 1991; Mahootian &amp; Santorini, 1994; Backus, 1996). While code-switching essentially involves the reconciliation of the word orders of both languages, only the word-order of the recipient l</context>

The first general explanation to account for this distribution was Poplack&apos;s (1978, 1980) argument that switching should be favored at the kinds of syntactic boundaries which occur in both languages, thus avoiding word order that might seem unnatural according to one or both grammars: the equivalence constraint (see also Lipski, 1977; Pfaff, 1979). Despite criticism of this approach (Rivas, 1981; Woolford, 1983; Di Sciullo et al., 1986; Pandit, 1990; Myers-Scotton, 1993; Belazi et al., 1994; Mahootian &amp; Santorini, 1994), it has been successfully used to account for code-switching in Spanish-English (Poplack, 1978,1980), FinnishEnglish (Poplack et al., 1987b), Arabic-French (Nait M&apos;Barek &amp; Sankoff, 1988), Tamil-English (Sankoff et al., 1990), Fongbe-French (Meechan &amp; Poplack, 1995), Wolof-French (Poplack &amp; Meechan, 1995), Igbo-English (Eze, 1997) and many other bilingual communities. Other fundamental facts about code-switched sentences include the well-formedness of monolingual fragments within such</context>

On the other hand, each of examples (2a,b,c,d) satisfy all of the conditions (i)-(iii). All that a speaker monitors is the language label of the constituent in which a potential switch occurs and that of its subconstituents. No additional labeling is warranted within this framework, though other treatments of code-switching all have their own particular way of assigning a label to each and every constituent (Rivas, 1981; Woolford, 1983; Joshi, 1985; Di Sciullo et al., 1986; Myers-Scotton, 1993). In particular, we would claim that there is no conceptual justification or need for postulating an underlying (or &amp;quot;matrix&amp;quot;) language for the entire sentence itself when this is not motivated by criteria (ii) and (iii). 1.6.1 The equivalence constraint. In the string of words which constitute a codeswitched sentence in our model, there is no problem in identifying where a fragment in language A stops and one in language B starts. On the constituent level, however, it is not as obvious where this switch should be located and sometimes</context>
