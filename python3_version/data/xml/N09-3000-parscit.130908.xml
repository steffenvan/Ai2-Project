Welcome to the NAACL HLT 2009 Student Research Workshop and Doctoral Consortium! We are
pleased to continue this established tradition at ACL conferences.
The Student Research Workshop and Doctoral Consortium provides a venue for student researchers
in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, and Human Language Technologies to
present their work and receive feedback from the community. Unlike regular conference sessions, the
workshop welcomes work in progress. In the tradition of previous doctoral consortia, we recruited
expert panelists to provide a brief commentary on each oral presentation. We hope that as a result of
this workshop, the student participants are able to obtain exposure to the NAACL community and that
it helps with their future careers in this field.
This year we received 29 submissions from 11 countries. With a strong program committee of 86
reviewers, from advanced graduate students to senior experts in their field, we were able to keep the
individual reviewing load light and assign to each paper a team of three to six reviewers. Most papers
were reviewed by two student reviewers and two established researchers.
We would like to thank the reviewers for understanding the spirit of the workshop and giving careful
and constructive reviews. We hope their comments will be helpful to all the students who submitted
their work.
A grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation enables us to provide financial support to all
presenters to assist them in their travel to and attendance of the conference. We gratefully acknowledge
this generous contribution.
Finally, we would also like to thank the general chair of NAACL HLT 2009, Mari Ostendorf, the
program committee chairs, Michael Collins, Lucy Vanderwende, Doug Oard, and Shri Narayanan,
the publicity chairs Matthew Stone, Gokhan Tur, and Diana Inkpen, the publications chairs, Christy
Doran and Eric Ringger, the local arrangements chairs, James Martin and Martha Palmer, and the ACL
Business Manager, Priscilla Rasmussen, for all the support they have provided in the organization of
this workshop.
