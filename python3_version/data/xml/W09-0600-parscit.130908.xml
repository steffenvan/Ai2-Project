We are pleased to present the Proceedings of the 12th European Workshop on Natural Language
Generation (ENLG 2009). ENLG 2009 was held in Athens, Greece, as a workshop at the 12th
Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL 2009).
It was endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on Generation (SIGGEN).
The ENLG 2009 workshop continued a biennial series of workshops on natural language generation that
has been running since 1987. Previous European workshops have been held at Royaumont, Edinburgh,
Judenstein, Pisa, Leiden, Duisburg, Toulouse, Budapest, Aberdeen and Dagstuhl. The series provides a
regular forum for presentation of research in this area, both for NLG specialists and for researchers from
other areas, and together with INLG (the International Conference on Natural Language Generation)
with which it alternates, ENLG is the main forum for NLG research.
As always, ENLG invited substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all topics related to
natural language generation. Following our call, we received 37 submissions (both long and short)
of which 14 long papers and 10 short papers were accepted after a careful reviewing process. These
Proceedings include the final versions of the accepted papers.
Following up on a number of earlier evaluation campaigns, the Generation Challenges 2009 were
organized as one umbrella event designed to bring together different shared-task evaluation efforts
involving the generation of natural language. Two of these Generation Challenges were held in
conjunction with ENLG 2009. The GIVE Challenge (organized by a team consisting of Donna
Byron, Justine Cassell, Robert Dale, Alexander Koller, Johanna Moore, Jon Oberlander and Kristina
Striegnitz) tackled the generation of natural-language instructions to aid human task-solving in a
virtual environment. The TUNA Progress Test (organized by Albert Gatt, Anja Belz and Eric Kow)
offered an opportunity to improve on the 2008 Referring Expression Generation (REG 2008) challenge,
producing natural language referring expressions based on the TUNA domain representations. The
papers associated with the TUNA challenge are included in these proceedings, those associated with
the GIVE challenge will be published on line.
We would like to thank all who submitted papers and our programme committee for their hard work.
Thanks to the invited speakers, Regina Barzilay and Kees van Deemter, for their willingness to participate
in ENLG 2009. We would also like to thank Lennard van de Laar (www.dualler.nl) for doing an
excellent job designing the ENLG 2009 website. Many thanks also to Hendri Hondorp for his help
in preparing the proceedings. We received financial support from The Netherlands Organization for
Scientific Research (NWO), via the Vici project “Bridging the gap between computational linguistics
and psycholinguistics: The case of referring expressions” (Krahmer; 277-70-007), which is gratefully
acknowledged.
