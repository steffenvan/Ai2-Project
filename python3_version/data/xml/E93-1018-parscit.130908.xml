<bodyText confidence="0.999926529411765">
An assumption shared by many theories of
discourse is that discourse structure con-
strains anaphora resolution (cf. [Grosz and
Sidner 1986] for definite NPs, [Lascarides
and Asher 1991], [Nakhimovsky 1988]
for temporal anaphora, [Webber 1990]
for deictic pronouns and [Gardent 1991],
[Priist and Scha 1990] for VP ellipsis). The
aim of this paper is (i) to show that this as-
sumption also applies to multiple VP ellip-
sis (VPE), (ii) to argue that other levels of
linguistic information (such as syntax and
semantics) interact with discourse structure
in determining multiple VPE acceptability
and (iii) to make these intuitions precise
by providing a unification-based account of
multiple VPE resolution.

[Klein and Stainton-Ellis 1989] convincingly argue
that VPE need not resolve to the nearest possible
antecedent. The most intricate examples they give
to support this claim involve what they dubbed mul-
tiple VPE and can be illustrated by the follow-
ing discourses (square brackets surround antecedent
VPs, Oi indicates VP ellipses and indices represent
anaphoric dependencies)&apos;:

As these examples show, there is not one pattern
relating multiple VPEs to their antecedents, but at
least three: nesting, crossing and mixed. Nesting
and crossing can be represented as follows (where
VP, and 0i represent antecedent and elliptical VPs
respectively):
Nesting: VP&apos; VP n On • • • 01
Crossing: V131 01 . • • On
while a mixed pattern simply is a configuration in
which both crossing and nesting occur. According
to this terminology, (1) illustrates a nesting pattern,
(2) shows a crossing pattern and (3) a mixed pattern.
Thus, it is clear that no unique dependency config-
uration constrains the resolution of multiple VPEs.
On the contrary, it appears that all patterns are pos-
sible and thus that any configurational restriction on
VPE resolution is doomed to failure. Interestingly
however, despite the multiple ways in which each of
the VPEs could be resolved, there is in actual fact
no ambiguity as to how the global discourse should
be understood. This suggests that some strong con-
straints come into play to help the hearer resolve
the question: What is it that constrains multiple VPE
resolution in such a way that these &amp;quot;exotic&amp;quot; discourses
are in fact intelligible?

adequately. In what follows, I argue that discourse
structure (rather than surface ordering) is one of the
main constraint regulating multiple VPE resolution.

2 Discourse grammar and VPE
resolution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999515444444444">
The discourse grammar used builds
on [Polanyi and Scha 1984]. More specifically, I as-
sume that discourse is a tree structured entity whose
well formedness can be described by a unification
based discourse grammar. Under such a grammar,
a discourse constituent is either a discourse relation,
a clause or a discourse relation together with one
or more discourse constituent(s). The grammar as-
sociates with each constituent a complex category
which for the purpose of this paper, I will assume
to consist of the six main attributes PHO, CAT, SEM,
IN, OUT and RESTR. PHO, CAT, SEM unsurprisingly
denote the phonology, the category and the seman-
tic representation of the constituent described by the
complex category. IN and OUT are attributes which
represent the flow of anaphoric information, that is,
IN represents the in-going context (where a context
is a sequence of potential antecedents i.e. a sequence
of VP categories) and OUT, the out-going context.
Finally RESTR is short for restriction and takes as
value a constraint which must evaluate to true for
the category to be well-formed.
Conventions: In what follows I will omit any in-
formation that is not relevant to the purpose of the
discussion. In particular, I shall omit irrelevant at-
tributes in categories and any anaphoric information
not pertaining to VPE (i.e. anaphoric pronominal in-
formation is ignored). Furthermore, the values of IN
and OUT attributes (which should be VP categories)
will be abbreviated to the SEM values of these cat-
egories. Finally, I will use the term a-clause as an
abbreviation for antecedent clause and e-clause, for
elliptical clause.
A simple example will illustrate the workings of
the discourse grammar with respect to VPE resolu-
tion. Consider the discourse in (4).

<listItem confidence="0.8660515">

01 too.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997000166666667">
As indicated by the bracketed letters, this dis-
course includes three basic discourse constituents:
the two clauses (a) and (c) and the discourse con-
nective and. Consider first the category associated
with (a). Ignoring irrelevant attributes, this category
can be represented as follows2:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.966208">
2For expository purposes, I assume here a sentential
(rather than a discourse) semantics. In practice, however,
the analysis is to be based on a discourse semantics and
most importantly, the definitions of structural identity
and of equivalence classes over relations (see below) are
to apply to discourse semantics representations and to
discourse relations respectively.

<bodyText confidence="0.999170740740741">
With regard to VPE resolution, two points are rel-
evant. First the IN value is a don&apos;t-care-value (sym-
bolized here by the anonymous variable), thus sig-
naling the fact that incoming anaphoric information
is irrelevant in the case of non-elliptical clauses. Sec-
ond, the OUT value contains the information asso-
ciated with the sentence main VP thus signalling
the fact that non elliptical clauses update the cur-
rent outgoing context with new information. Note
that anaphoric information concerning VPs is here
assumed not to be cumulative, that is the OUT value
of D is not &amp;quot;added&amp;quot; to the IN value - rather it con-
stitutes the sole output of (a) independent of the
preceding context. The intuition formalised here is
that the discourse entity providing the interpreta-
tion of an elided VP is not as persistent as an indi-
vidual discourse entity and thus should remain local
to the discourse constituent that introduced it (al-
though in some particular cases such as e.g. paral-
lelism, anaphoric information pertaining to VPs can
be percolated by the discourse grammar rules). For
more details on this point, the reader is referred to
[Gardent 1991], pages 141-142.
Now consider the category assigned by the dis-
course grammar to the elliptical clause (c). Again
ignoring irrelevant attributes, this category can be
represented as:
</bodyText>

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99842375">
where B. and As are unification variables over re-
lations and arguments respectively. The important
point to note here is that the variables B. and As are
shared by the IN value on the one hand, and by the
SEM value on the other. This in effect implements
VPE resolution. To see this, suppose that we have a
discourse rule of the following form (AND abbreviates
the category for and):

and:[Semi,Sem2]

[Outi, Out2]
Application of this rule to the categories of (a), (b)
and (c) above will trigger the unification of Out&apos;
with [like:[m]] on the one hand, and [R:As] on the
other. Thus [R:As] is unified with [like:[m]] and the
semantic representation R:[p I As] of (c) will become
like:[p,m], just as required.

3.1 Some data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99033425">
The claim this paper makes about multiple VPE res-
olution is that the same discourse relation must hold
between the multiple VP ellipses on the one hand and
the multiple antecedents on the other. The present
section has for object to substantiate this claim. As
a first case in point, consider the following example.
I never go swimming because I don&apos;t look
good in a swimming suit. (causal)
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9384942">
a. I might if I did. (causal)

c. Sarah does and so she does. (causal)
d. ? I might after I did. (temporal)
e. ? I might but I did. (contrast)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9969141">
Example (5) gives a case of a-clauses which are
related by a causal relation. Several possible contin-
uations are then given, some of them are acceptable,
some of them are not. The relevant observation is
that in those cases where the relation holding be-
tween e-clauses also is a causal one, the continuation
is acceptable; however, in those cases where the rela-
tion holding between e-clauses is of a different nature,
the continuation is inacceptable.
As a second case in point, consider example (6):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996944125">
(6) I was thin then and the trousers looked good
on me and I should have bought them,
(THIN LG) A BT

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982166666667">
Here the antecedent discourse unit consists of three
clauses, the first two can be said to be related by
a causal relation (because I was thin, the trousers
looked good on me) whereas the third clause is con-
joined to the first two. Again, several possible contin-
uations are given, some of them are acceptable, some
of them are not. This time, the observation is that
in the case where no causal relation can be estab-
lished between the appropriate e-clauses (i.e. when
those clauses corresponding to the cause and to the
result of the cause are not adjacent), the continu-
ation is unacceptable3. That is, in the case where
an identical relational pattern cannot be established
for e- and a-clauses, multiple VPE becomes hard to
understand, if not unacceptable.
In what follows, I take these examples to suggest
that the same discourse relation must hold between
a- and e-clauses resepctively. I characterise this ob-
servation in terms of parallelism, make this notion
precise and show how it interacts with other gram-
mar components (e.g. syntax and semantic) to deter-
mine multiple VPE resolution. It should be stressed
however that the approach can only be as precise
as the definition of discourse relations and unfortu-
nately, this notion is notoriously elusive. Nonethe-
less the hope is that this paper captures an impor-
tant intuition about multiple VPE resolution namely,
the intuition that parallelism constitutes one of the
(many) factors affecting multiple VPE acceptability
and interpretation.

3.2 Formal analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989166857142857">
Assuming a discourse grammar of the type described
in section (2), the claims this paper makes about
multiple VPE resolution are (i) that whenever a dis-
course contains multiple VPEs, the clauses contain-
ing the VPEs and those containing the antecedent
VPs form two complex discourse constituents which
are related together by the relation of parallelism
and (ii) that parallelism constrains VPE resolution
in that each VPE will resolve to the &amp;quot;parallel VP&amp;quot; in
the complex discourse constituents formed by the a-
clauses. We now make these claims precise. First, we
define the semantic representation language ,C used
by the grammar described in section (2). ,C consists
of the wffs described by the following syntax:
wff { term, formula,
polarity:rel:[wffi yarn]
term { variable, constant }
formula polarity:predicate:[argi argn]
arg { term, formula }
rel --+ constant
predicate constant
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.7015075">
polarity { 1, 0 }
The intuition is that is a quantifier free lan
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999819846153846">
guage where variables are unification variables and
polarity (i.e. absence or presence of negation) is
always explicit (that is, non-negated wffs are de-
scribed as positive i.e. marked with 1). Thus for
instance, the expression 0:and:[0:p, 1:q] is a wff of
which one can think of as the more traditional
propositional logic formula -,(-pAg). We call PROP
the set of wffs of the form polarity:predicate:[argi
argn]4. Given this language C, the discourse relation
of parallelism is said to hold between two propo-
sitions represented by the ,C wffs 40 and tF (written,
parallelism(, IF)) if 4&gt; is structurally identical with
if. Structural identity is defined as follows:

Then definition 3 adequately predicts that R1
=OM and R2 = GtM. That is, the constraint embod-
ied in definition 3 implements the fact that multiple
VPE resolution is sensitive to the semantic- rather
than to the surface-ordering of the antecedents.

3.3 Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974347111111111">
The above analysis can be implemented in the dis-
course grammar described in section (2) as follows.
The parallelism rule will be:

To state the constraint regulating multiple VPE res-
olution, we first define the notion of a yield.
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.803095625">
Definition 2 (Yield)
If 4:1) E C, then the yield of this semantic representa-
tion (1), written y(z.), is:
If (1) E PROP, Y(4)) = (t)
if (Z. = [4)1, • • • stn], Y(t) = Y(cti)•... • Y(rtn)
where • denotes
sequence concatenation
If (1, = p : Y(t) = Y(C)
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.991859375">
Thus the yield of an .0 wff (I) consists of the sequence
of atomic propositions contained in 40. Finally, we
state the constraint as follows:
Definition 3 (Constraint on multiple VPE
resolution)
Let 4&gt; be the semantic representation associated with
the discourse segment formed by the a-clauses and
be that associated with the e-clauses. Then, if

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.95500525">
then for 1 &lt; i &lt; n, Oi =Pi and ssi = tti.
That is, each elided predicate Oi and argument list
tti&apos; in y(*) resolves to the parallel predicate Pi and
argument list ss i in y(4.). To see how this constraint
works, consider example (1). Suppose that the dis-
course grammar assigns to the a- and the e- part
of this discourse the following (simplified) semantic
representations:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8736">
A-clauses: 0:and:[ 0:0M:[i], 1:GtM:[i]]
E-clauses: 1:and:[ 0:R2:[i]]

IN IN
OUT [OUT1 , OUT2]
RESTR SEMI. =, SEM2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.985687083333333">
This rule has two effects. First, it requires that
the semantic representations of the constituting dis-
course constituents be s-identical - this implements
the restriction stated in defining parallelism. Sec-
ond, it unifies the OUT value of the first discourse
constituent with the IN value of the second - this en-
sures that the antecedents provided by the first (pos-
sibly complex) discourse constituent are accessible to
any VPEs occuring in the second constituent. Now
consider the rule for the connective unless (where
UNLESS abbreviates the category associated with un-
less):

Note that the order of the resulting OUT value is
[Out2, Out]] (and not [Outi, Out2] as suggested by
the surface ordering). This reflects the fact that mul-
tiple VPE resolution is sensitive to the logical- rather
than the surface-ordering of its antecedents. Appli-
cation of the UNLESS rule to the a-clauses&apos; (I wouldn&apos;t
go to Manchester unless I open my mail) in example
(1) will yield the category (recall that irrelevant at-
tributes and attribute values are omitted):

4 Structural identity and semantic
equivalence
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97790284">
The approach proposed above relies on the syntactic
notion of structural identity. However it is a well-
known fact that syntactically distinct logical formu-
lae may be semantically equivalent. For instance,
(7) p q --,(p A --,q) V q
Now given these logical equivalences, it is un-
clear how the semantics of natural language discourse
should be represented. Suppose for instance, that we
have a discourse of the form If P, Q. Then there is a
choice as to how this discourse should be represented,
namely should it be represented as p —+ q,—.(p A —,q)
or —.73V q (where p and q represent the semantic con-
tent of the discourses P and Q related by if)? Tra-
ditionally, it is assumed that such a discourse will
translate to what could be called the canonical form
i.e p q. However, the data on multiple ellipses
(and the analysis proposed here) suggests that this
should not always be the only possibility. As a case
in point, consider example (8).
(8) If he is [1. lucky], he has [2 ordered his software
from a house that can help]. If he hasn&apos;t 02,
he isn&apos;t 01 and may the gods be with him
because he will need it.
Suppose that both a- and e-clauses translate to the
canonical form, we then have the following semantic
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.919995466666667">
representations7:
A-clauses: Ax.lucky(x)(i) --+ Ax.buy(x,
sw, fhtch)(i)
E-clauses: (i)
And definition 3 will yield the (wrong) prediction:
Pi = Az.lucky(x)
P2 = Ax.buy(x,sw, fhtch)
Now suppose that the semantics of the e-clauses
(i.e. -,Pi(i) —,P2(0) is replaced by the semanti-
cally equivalent:
P2 ( -+ P1 (i)
Definition 3 will then yield the (correct) predic-
tion:
P2 = Ax.buy(x,sw, fhtch)
Pi = Ax.lucky(x)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999291166666667">
So it seems that a given natural language con-
nective should be allowed to be ambiguous between
several semantically equivalent but syntactically dis-
tinct discourse relations (for instance, if could be as-
signed all translations given in (7) above). But if this
is so, the question then arises as to how this ambigu-
ity can be resolved. The claim I want to make is that
both the resolution of this ambiguity and the reso-
lution of multiple VP ellipses result from a complex
interaction between syntax, semantics and pragmat-
ics. The following section provides some evidence in
support of this claim.

5 The interaction of parallelism with
other levels of linguistic
information
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992838">
So far I have argued that multiple VPE resolution is
subject to the discourse constraint that the proposi-
tions expressed by e- and a-clauses must be related
by the discourse relation of parallelism. I have then
shown that due to semantic equivalence, there might
be several parallel configurations potentially holding
between a- and e-clauses. However the actual data
shows little ambiguity: in most cases, the hearer can
single out the (unique) intended reading. In this sec-
tion, I argue that the discourse constraint of paral-
lelism interacts with other sources of linguistic infor-
mation to determine this unique reading. In particu-
lar, I argue that syntax, semantics and pragmatics all
contribute to solve the ambiguity raised by semantic
equivalences between discourse relations.
7To improve readibility, I use here (and in the rest
of this section) an informal notation to describe the se-
mantics of discourse. P, represent the semantics of VPEs
where i indicates surface ordering.

Consider again example (8) where the discourse
formed by the e-clauses is of the form If P, Q and
the associated semantic representation may be ei-
ther p q or —I Now look at the syn-
tax of antecedent and elliptical VPs. The first el-
liptical VP is the perfective auxiliary has and thus
subcategorises for a past participle whereas the sec-
ond ellipsis consists of copula be and thus selects a
predicative phrase. Correspondingly, the antecedent
VPs are (1) a predicative phrase (lucky) and (2) a
past participle (ordered his software from a house
that can help). If we assume that VPE acceptability
is sensitive to the syntactic information associated
with the antecedent, then the above observations ex-
plain why the discourse relation holding between a-
and e-clauses must be rather than p q.
For in the first case hasn&apos;t indeed resolves to a past
participle (namely ordered his software from a house
that can help) and isn&apos;t to a predicative phrase (i.e.
lucky); whereas in the second case, the subcategori-
sation requirements of the auxiliaries are systemati-
cally violated. Thus if we assume that the (or at least
some) syntactic properties of the antecedent VPs are
relevant in determining VPE acceptability, then we
can account for the fact that despite of the ambi-
guity introduced by semantic equivalences between
discourse relations, there is only one reading for (8)
i.e. the reading which is compatible both with the
discourse requirement of parallelism between a- and
e-clauses and with the syntactic constraints betweeen
antecedent and elliptical VP. As already mentioned
(cf. section 2), the present discourse grammar makes
precisely this assumption since it takes anaphoric in-
formation to be sequences of VP categories i.e feature
structures containing inter alia syntactic information
about admissible antecedent VPs.

5.2 Semantics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995207985294118">
[Sag 1980] argues that VPE is subject to a con-
straint on semantic representations, which is dubbed
the alphabetical variant constraint. The analysis is
convincing in that it accounts for a wide range of
facts about VPE and its interaction with other lin-
guistic phenomena such as quantification, extrac-
tion, pseudo-clefts, ready constructions and equi-
sentences. For instance, the alphabetic variant con-
straint will account for the inacceptability of (9)8:
If every boy thinks that Mary is in love with
him, the party will be a success. * If they
don&apos;t, it won&apos;t.
Note that in this case, discourse parallelism does
hold between a- and e-clauses. So if discourse paral-
lelism (as defined in this paper) was taken to be the
only constraint regulating VPE acceptability, this
&apos;To be compared with the well formed: If every boy
brings a bottle, the party will be a success. If they don&apos;t,
it won&apos;t.
(ill formed) discourse could not be rejected by the
grammar. However, if Sag&apos;s constraint is assumed
then the ill-formedness of (9) can be accounted for
as follows. Sag&apos;s constraint states that VPE is ac-
ceptable if the semantic representation of the an-
tecedent VP (which he assumes to be a lambda ab-
straction over individuals) is identical up to renam-
ing of bound variables with the semantic represen-
tation of the ellipsis and furthermore, all occurences
of a free variable occuring both in the representation
of the antecedent and of the ellipsis are bound by
the same operator. Given this, the ill-formedness of
(9) is explained by the fact that the pronoun him
is represented by a variable (say, y) which is free in
the semantic representation associated with the an-
tecedent VP (i.e. Az .think(x , love(m, y))) and can-
not be bound by the same operator (i.e. the universal
quantifier introduced by the subject NP every boy)
when occuring in the semantic representation of the
elliptical VP (because it occurs outside the scope of
every).
Here again, the assumption that the antecedent
of a VPE is represented by a monostratal category
means that Sag&apos;s alphabetic variant constraint can
easily be integrated in the present account. This can
be done in two ways. The first possibility consists
in adopting Sag&apos;s view and adding a constraint in
the category associated with VP ellipsis auxiliaries
to the effect that the semantic representation of the
antecedent VP and that of the ellided VP must be
alphabetic variants of each other. This has the incon-
venience of requiring a global check over the semantic
representation of the whole discourse segment con-
taining a- and e-clauses, a check which is essentially
non compositional in nature. A second possibility is
to adopt a dynamic semantics (i.e. a semantics where
meaning is taken to be a relation between contexts
and where a context contains information about pro-
noun denotations). Under such an assumption, it can
be shown that the inacceptability of any discourse vi-
olating the alphabetic variant constraint comes out
as a failure to interpret this discourse (model theo-
retic interpretation simply fails) so that the seman-
tic representation of a- and e-clauses need not be
checked upon. Such an approach is described in
[Gardent 1990] and could easily be integrated in the
present framework: it suffices to replace the static
semantics whose syntax is described in 3, by the dy-
namic semantics given in [Gardent 1990].

5.3 Pragmatics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998655">
Just as syntax and semantics, pragmatics can inter-
act with discourse constraints to determine multiple
VPE acceptability. A particularly clear illustration
of this interaction comes from the pragmatics of dis-
course connectives i.e. words such as but, unless, etc.
Consider for instance the discourse in (10).

a. I did but she didn&apos;t.
b. * I did but she did.
Although both continuations can be viewed as par-
allel to the a-clauses (cf. section 6), only continua-
tion (a) is acceptable. Continuation (b) is inaccept-
able because the pragmatics of but (which requires
some contrastive relation to hold between the propo-
sitions it relates) is violated.
The discourse grammar sketched here does not in-
tegrate pragmatic information and thus cannot ac-
count for the difference in acceptability between (a)
and (b). Whether it can be extended to do so re-
mains an open question although recent work in
pragmatics (such as [Elhadad and McKeown 1990])
suggests that the monostratal, unification based ap-
proach to discourse grammar is fully compatible with
a comprehensive treatment of the semantics and

<bodyText confidence="0.999041459459459">
While section (3) argues that multiple VPE resolu-
tion is subject to the discourse constraint of paral-
lelism, section (5) shows that it is also sensitive to
other linguistic components such as syntax and se-
mantics. The present section (i) discusses how the
resulting overall analysis accounts for the examples
given so far, (ii) introduces some additional data and
(iii) summarises how the various linguistic modules
interact in determining VPE acceptability for the set
of cases presented throughout the paper.
We start by examining the examples given so far.
Examples (2) and (5a) are simple cases of discourse
parallelism where a- and e-clauses translate to the
same canonical LF and no extraneous factor blocks
resolution so that each VPE resolves to the paral-
lel element in the antecedent discourse constituent.
Example (3) is more intricate and can actually be
explained in two different ways. A first possibility
is to assume that / should have bought them and but
/ didn&apos;t form a discourse constituent and, / was re-
ally thin and ... the ski-pants looked really good on
me and now I&apos;m not and they wouldn&apos;t another (the
intuition here would be that discourse constituents
reflect the temporal structure of discourse, that is,
temporally related events must be part of the same
discourse constituent). Under this first hypothesis,
we have on the one hand a case of (single) VP ellipsis
where but I didn&apos;t resolves to I didn&apos;t buy them and on
the other hand a simple case of parallelism between
complex discourse constituents10. The second possi-
bility is to consider that the three a-clauses form a
discourse constituent which is parallel with the dis-
course constituent formed by the three e-clauses. In
&apos;Thanks to an anonymous referree for pointing out
this possible interpretation.
this case, the semantic representations of a- and e-
clauses can be symbolised as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8441405">
A-clauses: (T LG) A BT
E-clauses: 01 A (02 03)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996857875">
This clearly does not obey parallelism. In this
case, syntax imposes the choice of an equivalent LF
(i.e. (02 —+ 03) A 01 ). As in (8), this syntactic con-
straint stems from the subcategorisation requirement
of a VPE auxiliary, namely &apos;m not which requires a
predicative phrase as antecedent.
For completeness, consider now the following ad-
ditional examples.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982150333333333">
(11) I gave her some questions to [i ask you] if you

(11) illustrates a case where parallelism constrains
the choice of an alternative semantic representation
with the result that the a-clauses semantics is rep-
resented by a wff of the form —.(p A —ig) rather than
the canonical semantic translation for discourses of
the form If P, Q i.e. p q. Example (12) pro-
vides one more illustration of the interaction of syn-
tax with discourse in determining multiple VPE reso-
lution whereas example (13) illustrates a simple case
of discourse parallelism.
The following table summarises these observa-
tions. The first column (Ex.) indicates the num-
ber of the example being referred to together with a
mention of the linguistic module, if any, which forced&apos;
the choice of an equivalent semantic representation:
D stands for Discourse and S for syntax. The sec-
ond column (Canonical LF) indicates the &amp;quot;canoni-
cal&amp;quot; semantic representations (or Logical Forms) of
a- and e-clauses: a-clauses are represented by capital
letter abbreviations which are mnemonic for their
propositional content, whereas the semantics of el-
liptical clauses is represented by 0 where i reflects
surface ordering. Finally, the third column indicates
an equivalent semantic representation for both e- or
a-clauses (or none when this is superfluous). The in-
tuition is that this column also indicates anaphoric
dependencies whereby it indicates for each ellipsis
which is the parallel element in the final semantic
representation of the a-clauses. To take an exam-
ple, consider the discourse in (1). For this discourse

the table indicates that discourse forces the choice
of a non-canonical semantic representation for the
a-clauses. That is, the choice of the non-canonical
semantic representation is determined in this case
by the discourse requirement that a- and e-clauses
stand in a parallelism relation. As a result, each ellip-
sis will resolve to its parallel element in the equivalent
LF (rather than the canonical one) i.e. 01 resolves to
OM (i.e. open a big stack of mad) and 02 to GtM
(i.e. go to Manchester).

7 Problems and further research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969483869565217">
A first problem concerns the propagation of
anaphoric information throughout the discourse tree.
To see what the problem is, consider the discourse in
(14).
(14) Jon won&apos;t dance unless Mary does.
In the absence of any additional context, the an-
tecedent of the VPE in the second clause is the VP of
the first clause i.e dance. Now let us examine again
the discourse rule for unless sketched in section 3.
For this rule, the distribution of anaphoric informa-
tion can be pictured as follows:
[Ii, 121 A [01, 02]
[Ii] [01] [12] [02]
Note that anaphoric information is only shared be-
tween mother and daughters, not between sisters.
This means that the rule sketched in section 3.3 will
fail to resolve the VPE in example (14) because in
this case, resolution can only obtain if 01 = 12 i.e. if
anaphoric information is shared between sisters. An
obvious fix would be to modify the unless rule so that
12 unifies not only with the IN value of the rightmost
daughter but also with the OUT value of the leftmost
daughter. The modified rule would then be:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.3533392">
SEM2 1
P2 J
0:and:[0:sEm2,0:sEm1]
[Ii, B12]
[02, 01]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999843666666667">
However, although this would solve the problem
raised by example (14), it would still fail to account
for cases such as (15).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989360333333333">
(15) (a) Jon won&apos;t [i dance] unless (b) Mary does
01 and (c) Bob won&apos;t [2 come] unless (d) Sarah
does 02-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963916666667">
Here the problem is that the new unless rule re-
quires the IN value of (d) to unify both with the OUT
value of (b) i.e. dance and with the OUT value of (c)
i.e. come. Clearly unification fails and thus example
(15), although perfectly well-formed, is rejected by
the grammar.
In more general terms, the problem is that
anaphoric information can come to be instantiated
both in a top-down and in a bottom-up fashion (i.e.
through sharing of information between mother and
daughter or through sharing of information between
sisters)11. When the two types of information con-
flict, unification fails and a perfectly well formed dis-
course may be rejected by the grammar. In other
words, the grammar will undergenerate.
There are several possible solutions to this prob-
lem. A first one would be to privilege one source
of information over the other, say by means of pri-
ority union. In this way, one anaphoric flow would
overwrite the other. But apart form the computa-
tional problems involved in using such rewrite opera-
tions at run time, it is also unclear which information
should be privileged. Thus although in (15), bottom-
up (or local) information seems to prevail, example
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9361652">
(16) shows that in some cases, top-down information
may be strongest:
(16) (a) Jon won&apos;t go to Manchester unless (b) he
opens his mail and (c) Bob won&apos;t go to Paris
unless (d) he does.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9944475">
&amp;quot;The first type of anaphoric flow is top-down in that
anaphoric information on the mother may be required to
unify with the anaphoric information of some other node
higher up in the discourse tree, whereas the second type
is bottom-up because the anaphoric information specified
on the sisters may in turn be required to unify with the
anaphoric information carried by some other node lower
down in the discourse tree.

<bodyText confidence="0.999984837209302">
Here, there is at least one reading where the el-
lipsis in (d) resolves to the parallel element (b) (i.e.
opens his mail) rather than to the immediately pre-
ceding VP (i.e. go to Paris). Furthermore it is easy
to find cases where the overall discourse is ambigu-
ous between a &amp;quot;top-down reading&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;bottom-
up&amp;quot; one. Thus perhaps a better solution would be
to always allow both possibilities and to let the vari-
ous modules of the grammar decide which reading is
actually available. The details and the adequacy of
such an approach, I leave here as an open research
question.
A second problem concerning the present paper
concerns the definition of discourse relations and of
equivalence classes over discourse relations. Here it
is perhaps worth stressing that although logical con-
nectives have been used throughout the paper to rep-
resent discourse relations, these are definitely not a
sufficient means of characterization. As a simple case
in point, consider a natural language discourse of the
form P so Q. In section 3.2, such a discourse is trans-
lated as p A q (where p and q represent the proposi-
tional content of the natural language discourses P
and Q respectively). Clearly this translation does
not exhaust the meaning of the discourse connective
so: for instance, the causal link between p and q is
not accounted for. More generally, it is clear that
much work remains to be done on the semantics of
discourse relations before the present analysis of mul-
tiple VPE resolution can be adequately tested.
Finally, a third question involves the interaction
of discourse grammar with anaphora resolution in
general. As already mentioned, the resolution of
most types of anaphora can be argued to be influ-
enced by discourse structure. It would be interest-
ing to investigate in how far the various mechanisms
developed to express this constraint are compati-
ble. More specifically, it would be interesting to see
whether the discourse grammar sketched in section
2 could be made to account for the complex interac-
tion of VPE with other anaphoric phenomena such
as strict/sloppy identity, pronominal and temporal
anaphora.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999170625">
A model has been proposed of how discourse struc-
ture influences multiple VPE resolution. However,
the suggestion is that the analysis generalises to all
cases of VPE, that is, that discourse structure is one
of the main factors determining VPE resolution in
general. In this sense, the analysis proposed here fits
well with one of the mainstream idea in discourse
theory, which is that discourse structure constrains
anaphora resolution. It should also be pointed out
that this analysis includes a treatment of parallelism
similar to that developed in [Asher forthcoming] and
is as such likely to be compatible with the treatment
of sloppy/strict ambiguity proposed there.
The model proposed is characterised by two main
properties: reversibility and monostratality. It is
reversible because it is characterised in a purely
declarative manner. Note in particular that the def-
inition of structural identity is entirely independent
of any notion of processing and is as such strictly
declarative. In practical terms, this means that this
model can be used both for analysis and for gen-
eration. Monostratality (i.e the fact that different
levels of linguistic information can be stated within a
category) is another important aspect of the model
in that it allows for different knowledge sources to
interact in determining VPE acceptability and res-
olution. A typical example of this interaction is in-
volved in the treatment of cases of multiple VPE
involving semantically equivalent wffs: in such cases,
syntax often interacts with discourse information to
determine the correct resolution. More generally, it
can be argued that VPE is a phenomenon which
simultaneously involves phonology, syntax, seman-
tics and discourse (cf. [Lappin and McCord 1990],
[Gardent 1991]). The present model allows for such
a simultaneous interaction and thus improves on se-
rial models of VPE resolution (i.e. models where the
various levels of linguistic information interact in a
serial rather than a simultaneous fashion) such as
[Webber 1978].
The model described in this paper has been imple-
mented in SICSTUS PROLOG and runs on a SUN
4 computer. It has been tested in analysis as well as
in generation mode.
