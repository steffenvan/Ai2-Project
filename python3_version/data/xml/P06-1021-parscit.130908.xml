Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999958352941177">
A grammatical method of combining two
kinds of speech repair cues is presented.
One cue, prosodic disjuncture, is detected
by a decision tree-based ensemble clas-
sifier that uses acoustic cues to identify
where normal prosody seems to be inter-
rupted (Lickley, 1996). The other cue,
syntactic parallelism, codifies the expec-
tation that repairs continue a syntactic
category that was left unfinished in the
reparandum (Levelt, 1983). The two cues
are combined in a Treebank PCFG whose
states are split using a few simple tree
transformations. Parsing performance on
the Switchboard and Fisher corpora sug-
gests that these two cues help to locate
speech repairs in a synergistic way.

The authors are very grateful for Eugene Charniak’s help
adapting his parser. We also thank the Center for Language
and Speech processing at Johns Hopkins for hosting the sum-
mer workshop where much of this work was done. This

“repairs” what he or she has already uttered.
This extra material renders the entire utterance
ungrammatical—the string would not be gener-
ated by a correct grammar of fluent English. In
particular, attractive tools for natural language
understanding systems, such as Treebank gram-
mars for written corpora, naturally lack appropri-
ate rules for analyzing these constructions.
One possible response to this mismatch be-
tween grammatical resources and the brute facts
of disfluent speech is to make one look more
like the other, for the purpose of parsing. In
this separate-processing approach, reparanda are
located through a variety of acoustic, lexical or
string-based techniques, then excised before sub-
mission to a parser (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996;
Heeman and Allen, 1999; Spilker et al., 2000;
Johnson and Charniak, 2004). The resulting
parse tree then has the reparandum re-attached in
a standardized way (Charniak and Johnson, 2001).
An alternative strategy, adopted in this paper, is
to use the same grammar to model fluent speech,
disfluent speech, and their interleaving.
Such an integrated approach can use syntac-
tic properties of the reparandum itself. For in-
stance, in example (1) the reparandum is an
unfinished noun phrase, the repair a finished
noun phrase. This sort of phrasal correspon-
dence, while not absolute, is strong in conver-
sational speech, and cannot be exploited on the
separate-processing approach. Section 3 applies
metarules (Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1983;
McKelvie, 1998a; Core and Schubert, 1999) in
recognizing these correspondences using standard
context-free grammars.
At the same time as it defies parsing, con-
versational speech offers the possibility of lever-
aging prosodic cues to speech repairs. Sec-

tion 2 describes a classifier that learns to label
prosodic breaks suggesting upcoming disfluency.
These marks can be propagated up into parse
trees and used in a probabilistic context-free gram-
mar (PCFG) whose states are systematically split
to encode the additional information.
Section 4 reports results on Switchboard (God-
frey et al., 1992) and Fisher EARS RT04F data,
suggesting these two features can bring about in-
dependent improvements in speech repair detec-
tion. Section 5 suggests underlying linguistic and
statistical reasons for these improvements. Sec-

to other related work, including state of the art
separate-processing approaches. Section 7 con-
cludes by indicating a way that string- and tree-

phenomena.
One way to capture this notion in the syntax
is to enhance the input with a special disjunc-
ture symbol. This symbol can then be propa-
gated in the grammar, as illustrated in Figure 2.
This work uses a suffix ˜+ to encode the percep-
tion of abnormal prosody after a word, along with
phrasal -BRK tags to decorate the path upwards to
reparandum constituents labeled EDITED. Such

<bodyText confidence="0.964488631578947">
Everyday experience as well as acoustic anal-
ysis suggests that the syntactic interruption in
speech repairs is typically accompanied by a
change in prosody (Nakatani and Hirschberg,
1994; Shriberg, 1994). For instance, the spectro-
gram corresponding to example (2), shown in Fig-
ure 1,

reveals a noticeable pause between the occurrence
of the two ors, and an unexpected glottalization at
the end of the first one. Both kinds of cues have
been advanced as explanations for human listen-
ers’ ability to identify the reparandum even before
the repair occurs.
Retaining only the second explanation, Lickley
(1996) proposes that there is no “edit signal” per se
but that repair is cued by the absence of smooth

disjuncture symbols are identified in the ToBI la-
beling scheme as break indices (Price et al., 1991;
Silverman et al., 1992).
The availability of a corpus annotated with
ToBI labels makes it possible to design a break
index classifier via supervised training. The cor-
pus is a subset of the Switchboard corpus, con-
sisting of sixty-four telephone conversations man-
ually annotated by an experienced linguist accord-
ing to a simplified ToBI labeling scheme (Osten-
dorf et al., 2001). In ToBI, degree of disjuncture
is indicated by integer values from 0 to 4, where
a value of 0 corresponds to clitic and 4 to a major
phrase break. In addition, a suffix p denotes per-
ceptually disfluent events reflecting, for example,

hesitation or planning. In conversational speech
the intermediate levels occur infrequently and the
break indices can be broadly categorized into three
groups, namely, 1, 4 and p as in Wong et al.
(2005).
A classifier was developed to predict three
break indices at each word boundary based on
variations in pitch, duration and energy asso-
ciated with word, syllable or sub-syllabic con-
stituents (Shriberg et al., 2005; Sonmez et al.,
1998). To compute these features, phone-level
time-alignments were obtained from an automatic
speech recognition system. The duration of these
phonological constituents were derived from the
ASR alignment, while energy and pitch were com-
puted every 10ms with snack, a public-domain
sound toolkit (Sjlander, 2001). The duration, en-
ergy, and pitch were post-processed according to
stylization procedures outlined in Sonmez et al.
(1998) and normalized to account for variability
across speakers.
Since the input vector can have missing val-
ues such as the absence of pitch during unvoiced
sound, only decision tree based classifiers were
investigated. Decision trees can handle missing
features gracefully. By choosing different com-
binations of splitting and stopping criteria, an
ensemble of decision trees was built using the
publicly-available IND package (Buntine, 1992).
These individual classifiers were then combined
into ensemble-based classifiers.
Several classifiers were investigated for detect-
ing break indices. On ten-fold cross-validation,
a bagging-based classifier (Breiman, 1996) pre-
dicted prosodic breaks with an accuracy of 83.12%
while chance was 67.66%. This compares favor-
ably with the performance of the supervised classi-
fiers on a similar task in Wong et al. (2005). Ran-
dom forests and hidden Markov models provide
marginal improvements at considerable computa-
tional cost (Harper et al., 2005).
For speech repair, the focus is on detecting dis-
fluent breaks. The precision and recall trade-off
on its detection can be adjusted using a thresh-
old on the posterior probability of predicting “p”,
as shown in Figure 3.
In essence, the large number of acoustic and
prosodic features related to disfluency are encoded
via the ToBI label ‘p’, and provided as additional
observations to the PCFG. This is unlike previous
work on incorporating prosodic information (Gre-

3 Syntactic parallelism
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992666666667">
The other striking property of speech repairs is
their parallel character: subsequent repair regions
‘line up’ with preceding reparandum regions. This
property can be harnessed to better estimate the
length of the reparandum by considering paral-
lelism from the perspective of syntax. For in-
stance, in Figure 4(a) the unfinished reparandum
noun phrase is repaired by another noun phrase –
the syntactic categories are parallel.

3.1 Levelt’s WFR and Conjunction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999616">
The idea that the reparandum is syntactically par-
allel to the repair can be traced back to Levelt
(1983). Examining a corpus of Dutch picture de-
scriptions, Levelt proposes a bi-conditional well-
formedness rule for repairs (WFR) that relates the
structure of repairs to the structure of conjunc-
tions. The WFR conceptualizes repairs as the con-
junction of an unfinished reparandum string (α)
with a properly finished repair (γ). Its original
formulation, repeated here, ignores optional inter-
regna like “er” or “I mean.”
Well-formedness rule for repairs (WFR) A re-
pair (α γ) is well-formed if and only if there
is a string β such that the string (αβ and* γ)
is well-formed, where β is a completion of
the constituent directly dominating the last
element of α. (and is to be deleted if that
last element is itself a sentence connective)
In other words, the string α is a prefix of a phrase
whose completion, β—if it were present—would

<bodyText confidence="0.999983636363636">
render the whole phrase αQ grammatically con-
joinable with the repair -y. In example (1) α is the
string ‘the first kind of invasion of’, -y is ‘the first
type of privacy’ and Q is probably the single word
‘privacy.’
This kind of conjoinability typically requires
the syntactic categories of the conjuncts to be the
same (Chomsky, 1957, 36). That is, a rule schema
such as (2) where X is a syntactic category, is pre-
ferred over one where X is not constrained to be
the same on either side of the conjunction.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99772">
X —* X Conj X (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923333333333">
If, as schema (2) suggests, conjunction does fa-
vor like-categories, and, as Levelt suggests, well-
formed repairs are conjoinable with finished ver-
sions of their reparanda, then the syntactic cate-
gories of repairs ought to match the syntactic cat-
egories of (finished versions of) reparanda.

Levelt’s WFR imposes two requirements on a

Both requirements can be met by adapting Tree-
bank grammars to mirror the analysis of McK-
elvie1 (1998a; 1998b). McKelvie derives phrase
structure rules for speech repairs from fluent rules
by adding a new feature called abort that can
take values true and false. For a given gram-

McKelvie’s formulation of Levelt’s WFR can be

3.3.1 Unfinished phrases

<bodyText confidence="0.999965285714286">
Some Treebanks already mark unfinished
phrases. For instance, the Penn Treebank pol-
icy (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994) is
to annotate the lowest node that is unfinished with
an -UNF tag as in Figure 4(a).
It is straightforward to propagate this mark up-
wards in the tree from wherever it is annotated to
the nearest enclosing EDITED node, just as -BRK
is propagated upwards from disjuncture marks on
individual words. This percolation simulates the
action of McKelvie’s [abort = true]. The re-
sulting PCFG is one in which distributions on
phrase structure rules with ‘missing’ daughters are
segregated from distributions on ‘complete’ rules.

<bodyText confidence="0.999957866666667">
The other key element of Levelt’s WFR is the
idea of conjunction of elements that are in some
sense the same. In the Penn Treebank annota-
tion scheme, reparanda always receive the label
EDITED. This means that the syntactic category
of the reparandum is hidden from any rule which
could favor matching it with that of the repair.
Adding an additional mark on this EDITED node
(a kind of daughter annotation) rectifies the situ-
ation, as depicted in Figure 4(b), which adds the
notation -childNP to a tree in which the unfin-
ished tags have been propagated upwards. This
allows a Treebank PCFG to represent the general-
ization that speech repairs tend to respect syntactic
category.

The other measure, EDIT-finding F, restricts con-

measures the per-word performance identifying a
word as dominated by EDITED or not. As in pre-
vious studies, reference transcripts were used in all

prosodic breaks where automatically inferred by

<bodyText confidence="0.999263210526316">
The pattern of improvement in tables 1, 2, and
3 from none or baseline rows where no syntac-
tic parallelism or break index information is used,
to subsequent rows where it is used, suggest why
these techniques work. Unfinished-category an-
notation improves performance by preventing the
grammar of unfinished constituents from being
polluted by the grammar of finished constituents.
Such purification is independent of the fact that
rules with daughters labeled EDITED-childXP
tend to also mention categories labeled XP fur-
ther to the right (or NP and VP, when XP starts
with S). This preference for syntactic parallelism
can be triggered either by externally-suggested
ToBI break indices or grammar rules annotated
with -UNF. The prediction of a disfluent break
could be further improved by POS features and N-
gram language model scores (Spilker et al., 2001;
Liu, 2004).

<bodyText confidence="0.999497125">
There have been relatively few attempts to harness
prosodic cues in parsing. In a spoken language
system for VERBMOBIL task, Batliner and col-
leagues (2001) utilize prosodic cues to dramati-
cally reduce lexical analyses of disfluencies in a
end-to-end real-time system. They tackle speech
repair by a cascade of two stages – identification of
potential interruption points using prosodic cues
with 90% recall and many false alarms, and the
lexical analyses of their neighborhood. Their ap-
proach, however, does not exploit the synergy be-
tween prosodic and syntactic features in speech re-
pair. In Gregory et al. (2004), over 100 real-valued
acoustic and prosodic features were quantized into
a heuristically selected set of discrete symbols,
which were then treated as pseudo-punctuation in
a PCFG, assuming that prosodic cues function like
punctuation. The resulting grammar suffered from
data sparsity and failed to provide any benefits.
Maximum entropy based models have been more
successful in utilizing prosodic cues. For instance,
in Lease et al. (2005), interruption point probabil-
ities, predicted by prosodic classifiers, were quan-
tized and introduced as features into a speech re-
pair model along with a variety of TAG and PCFG
features. Towards a clearer picture of the inter-
action with syntax and prosody, this work uses
ToBI to capture prosodic cues. Such a method is
analogous to Kahn et al. (2005) but in a genera-
tive framework.

(2004) is a separate-processing approach that rep-

Johnson and Charniak explicitly model the
crossed dependencies between individual words
in the reparandum and repair regions, intersect-
ing this sequence model with a parser-derived lan-
guage model for fluent speech. This second step
improves on Stolcke and Shriberg (1996) and Hee-
man and Allen (1999) and outperforms the specific
grammar-based reparandum-finders tested in sec-
tion 4. However, because of separate-processing
the TAG channel model’s analyses do not reflect
the syntactic structure of the sentence being ana-
lyzed, and thus that particular TAG-based model
cannot make use of properties that depend on the
phrase structure of the reparandum region. This
includes the syntactic category parallelism dis-
cussed in section 3 but also predicate-argument
structure. If edit hypotheses were augmented to
mention particular tree nodes where the reparan-
dum should be attached, such syntactic paral-
lelism constraints could be exploited in the rerank-
ing framework of Johnson et al. (2004).
The approach in section 3 is more closely re-
lated to that of Core and Schubert (1999) who
also use metarules to allow a parser to switch from
speaker to speaker as users interrupt one another.
They describe their metarule facility as a modi-
fication of chart parsing that involves copying of
specific arcs just in case specific conditions arise.
That approach uses a combination of longest-first
heuristics and thresholds rather than a complete
probabilistic model such as a PCFG.
Section 3’s PCFG approach can also be viewed
as a declarative generalization of Roark’s (2004)
EDIT-CHILD function. This function helps an
incremental parser decide upon particular tree-
drawing actions in syntactically-parallel contexts
like speech repairs. Whereas Roark conditions the
expansion of the first constituent of the repair upon
the corresponding first constituent of the reparan-
dum, in the PCFG approach there exists a separate
rule (and thus a separate probability) for each al-
ternative sequence of reparandum constituents.

Conventional PCFGs can improve their detection
of speech repairs by incorporating Lickley’s hy-
pothesis about interrupted prosody and by im-
plementing Levelt’s well-formedness rule. These
benefits are additive.
The strengths of these simple tree-based tech-
niques should be combinable with sophisticated
string-based (Johnson and Charniak, 2004; Liu,
2004; Zhang and Weng, 2005) approaches by
applying the methods of Wieling et al. (2005)
for constraining parses by externally-suggested
brackets.

<abstract confidence="0.999555166666667">A grammatical method of combining two kinds of speech repair cues is presented. One cue, prosodic disjuncture, is detected by a decision tree-based ensemble classifier that uses acoustic cues to identify where normal prosody seems to be interrupted (Lickley, 1996). The other cue, syntactic parallelism, codifies the expectation that repairs continue a syntactic category that was left unfinished in the reparandum (Levelt, 1983). The two cues are combined in a Treebank PCFG whose states are split using a few simple tree transformations. Parsing performance on the Switchboard and Fisher corpora suggests that these two cues help to locate speech repairs in a synergistic way.</abstract>

One possible response to this mismatch between grammatical resources and the brute facts of disfluent speech is to make one look more like the other, for the purpose of parsing. In this separate-processing approach, reparanda are located through a variety of acoustic, lexical or string-based techniques, then excised before submission to a parser (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996; Heeman and Allen, 1999; Spilker et al., 2000; Johnson and Charniak, 2004). The resulting parse tree then has the reparandum re-attached in a standardized way (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). An alternative strategy, adopted in this paper, is to use the same grammar to model fluent speech, disfluent speech, and their interleaving. Such an integrated approach can use syntactic properties of the reparandum itself. For instance, in example (1) the reparandum is an unfinished noun phrase, the repair a finished noun phrase. This sort of phrasal correspondence, while not absolute, is strong in conversational speech, and cannot be exploited on the separate-processing approach.

<context position="20332" citStr="Gregory et al. (2004)" startWordPosition="3293" endWordPosition="3296">d Work There have been relatively few attempts to harness prosodic cues in parsing. In a spoken language system for VERBMOBIL task, Batliner and colleagues (2001) utilize prosodic cues to dramatically reduce lexical analyses of disfluencies in a end-to-end real-time system. They tackle speech repair by a cascade of two stages – identification of potential interruption points using prosodic cues with 90% recall and many false alarms, and the lexical analyses of their neighborhood. Their approach, however, does not exploit the synergy between prosodic and syntactic features in speech repair. In Gregory et al. (2004), over 100 real-valued acoustic and prosodic features were quantized into a heuristically selected set of discrete symbols, which were then treated as pseudo-punctuation in a PCFG, assuming that prosodic cues function like punctuation. The resulting grammar suffered from data sparsity and failed to provide any benefits. Maximum entropy based models have been more successful in utilizing prosodic cues. For instance, in Lease et al. (2005), interruption point probabilities, predicted by prosodic classifiers, were quantized and introduced as features into a speech repair model along with a variet</context>

These individual classifiers were then combined into ensemble-based classifiers. Several classifiers were investigated for detecting break indices. On ten-fold cross-validation, a bagging-based classifier (Breiman, 1996) predicted prosodic breaks with an accuracy of 83.12% while chance was 67.66%. This compares favorably with the performance of the supervised classifiers on a similar task in Wong et al. (2005). Random forests and hidden Markov models provide marginal improvements at considerable computational cost (Harper et al., 2005). For speech repair, the focus is on detecting disfluent breaks. The precision and recall trade-off on its detection can be adjusted using a threshold on the posterior probability of predicting “p”, as shown in Figure 3. In essence, the large number of acoustic and prosodic features related to disfluency are encoded via the ToBI label ‘p’, and provided as additional observations to the PCFG.

They describe their metarule facility as a modification of chart parsing that involves copying of specific arcs just in case specific conditions arise. That approach uses a combination of longest-first heuristics and thresholds rather than a complete probabilistic model such as a PCFG.

Examining a corpus of Dutch picture descriptions, Levelt proposes a bi-conditional wellformedness rule for repairs (WFR) that relates the structure of repairs to the structure of conjunctions. The WFR conceptualizes repairs as the conjunction of an unfinished reparandum string (α) with a properly finished repair (γ). Its original formulation, repeated here, ignores optional interregna like “er” or “I mean.” Well-formedness rule for repairs (WFR) A repair (α γ) is well-formed if and only if there is a string β such that the string (αβ and* γ) is well-formed, where β is a completion of the con</context>

Both kinds of cues have been advanced as explanations for human listeners’ ability to identify the reparandum even before the repair occurs.

Such purification is independent of the fact that rules with daughters labeled EDITED-childXP tend to also mention categories labeled XP further to the right (or NP and VP, when XP starts with S). This preference for syntactic parallelism can be triggered either by externally-suggested ToBI break indices or grammar rules annotated with -UNF. The prediction of a disfluent break could be further improved by POS features and Ngram language model scores (Spilker et al., 2001; Liu, 2004). 6 Related Work There have been relatively few attempts to harness prosodic cues in parsing. In a spoken language system for VERBMOBIL task, Batliner and colleagues (2001) utilize prosodic cues to dramatically reduce lexical analyses of disfluencies in a end-to-end real-time system. They tackle speech repair by a cascade of two stages – identification of potential interruption points using prosodic cues with 90% recall and many false alarms, and the lexical analyses of their neighborhood.

In particular, attractive tools for natural language understanding systems, such as Treebank grammars for written corpora, naturally lack appropriate rules for analyzing these constructions. One possible response to this mismatch between grammatical resources and the brute facts of disfluent speech is to make one look more like the other, for the purpose of parsing. In this separate-processing approach, reparanda are located through a variety of acoustic, lexical or string-based techniques, then excised before submission to a parser (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996; Heeman and Allen, 1999; Spilker et al., 2000; Johnson and Charniak, 2004). The resulting parse tree then has the reparandum re-attached in a standardized way (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). An alternative strategy, adopted in this paper, is to use the same grammar to model fluent speech, disfluent speech, and their interleaving. Such an integrated approach can use syntactic properties of the reparandum itself. For instance, in example (1) the reparandum is an unfinished noun phrase, the repair a finished noun phrase.

Towards a clearer picture of the interaction with syntax and prosody, this work uses ToBI to capture prosodic cues. Such a method is analogous to Kahn et al. (2005) but in a generative framework. The TAG-based model of Johnson and Charniak (2004) is a separate-processing approach that rep166 resents the state of the art in reparandum-finding. Johnson and Charniak explicitly model the crossed dependencies between individual words in the reparandum and repair regions, intersecting this sequence model with a parser-derived language model for fluent speech. This second step improves on Stolcke and Shriberg (1996) and Heeman and Allen (1999) and outperforms the specific grammar-based reparandum-finders tested in section 4. However, because of separate-processing the TAG channel model’s analyses do not reflect the syntactic structure of the sentence being analyzed, and thus that particular TAG-based model cannot make use of properties that depend on the phrase structure of the reparandum region. This includes the syntactic category parallelism discussed in section 3 but also predicate-argument structure.

Section 3 applies metarules (Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1983; McKelvie, 1998a; Core and Schubert, 1999) in recognizing these correspondences using standard context-free grammars. At the same time as it defies parsing, conversational speech offers the possibility of leveraging prosodic cues to speech repairs.

In ToBI, degree of disjuncture is indicated by integer values from 0 to 4, where a value of 0 corresponds to clitic and 4 to a major phrase break. In addition, a suffix p denotes perceptually disfluent events reflecting, for example, 162 hesitation or planning. In conversational speech the intermediate levels occur infrequently and the break indices can be broadly categorized into three groups, namely, 1, 4 and p as in Wong et al. (2005). A classifier was developed to predict three break indices at each word boundary based on variations in pitch, duration and energy associated with word, syllable or sub-syllabic constituents (Shriberg et al., 2005; Sonmez et al., 1998). To compute these features, phone-level time-alignments were obtained from an automatic speech recognition system. The duration of these phonological constituents were derived from the ASR alignment, while energy and pitch were computed every 10ms with snack, a public-domain sound toolkit (Sjlander, 2001). The duration, energy, and pitch were post-processed acc</context>

By choosing different combinations of splitting and stopping criteria, an ensemble of decision trees was built using the publicly-available IND package (Buntine, 1992). These individual classifiers were then combined into ensemble-based classifiers. Several classifiers were investigated for detecting break indices. On ten-fold cross-validation, a bagging-based classifier (Breiman, 1996) predicted prosodic breaks with an accuracy of 83.12% while chance was 67.66%. This compares favorably with the performance of the supervised classifiers on a similar task in Wong et al. (2005). Random forests and hidden Markov models provide marginal improvements at considerable computational cost (Harper et al., 2005). For speech repair, the focus is on detecting disfluent breaks. The precision and recall trade-off on its detection can be adjusted using a threshold on the posterior probability of predicting “p”, as shown in Figure 3. In essence, the large number of acoustic and prosodic features related to disfluency are encoded via the ToBI label ‘p’, and provided as additional observations to the PCFG. This is unlike previous work on incorporating prosodic information (GreFigure</context>
