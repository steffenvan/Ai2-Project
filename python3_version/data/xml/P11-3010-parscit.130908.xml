Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999844208333333">
Sentiment analysis is one of the hot
demanding research areas since last few
decades. Although a formidable amount of
research has been done but still the existing
reported solutions or available systems are
far from perfect or to meet the satisfaction
level of end user&apos;s. The main issue may be
there are many conceptual rules that govern
sentiment, and there are even more clues
(possibly unlimited) that can convey these
concepts from realization to verbalization
of a human being. Human psychology
directly relates to the unrevealed clues;
govern the sentiment realization of us.
Human psychology relates many things
like social psychology, culture, pragmatics
and many more endless intelligent aspects
of civilization. Proper incorporation of
human psychology into computational
sentiment knowledge representation may
solve the problem. PsychoSentiWordNet is
an extension over SentiWordNet that holds
human psychological knowledge and
sentiment knowledge simultaneously.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960222222222">
In order to identify sentiment from a text, lexical
analysis plays a crucial role. For example, words
like love, hate, good and favorite directly indicate
sentiment or opinion. Various previous works
(Pang et al., 2002; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006;
Baccianella et. al., 2010) have already proposed
techniques for making dictionaries for those
sentiment words. But polarity assignment of such
sentiment lexicons is a hard semantic
disambiguation problem. The regulating aspects
which govern the lexical level semantic orientation
are natural language context (Pang et al., 2002),
language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006),
domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon,
2005), time dimension (Read, 2005), colors and
culture (Strapparava and Ozbal, 2010) and many
more unrevealed hidden aspects. Therefore it is a
challenging and enigmatic research problem.
What previous studies proposed is to attach prior
polarity to each sentiment lexicon level. Prior
polarity is an approximation value based on corpus
heuristics based statistics and not exact. The
probabilistic fixed point prior polarity scores do
not solve the problem completely rather it shoves
the problem into next level, called contextual
polarity classification.
The hypothesis we started with is that the
summation of all the regulating aspects of
sentiment orientation is human psychology and
thus it is called multi-faceted problem (Liu, 2010).
More precisely what we meant by human
psychology is the all known and unknown aspects,
directly or indirectly govern the sentiment
orientation knowledge of us. The regulating
aspects wrapped in the present
PsychoSentiWordNet are Gender, Age, City,
Country, Language and Profession.
The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension over
the existing SentiWordNet to hold the possible
psychological ingredients, governs the sentiment
understandability of us. The PsychoSentiWordNet
holds variable prior polarity scores, could be
fetched depending upon those psychological
regulating aspects. An example may illustrate the
definition better for the concept “Rock_Climbing”:

In the previous example the described concept
“Rock_Climbing” is generally positive as it is
adventurous and people have it to make fun or
excursion. But it demands highly physical ability
thus may be not as good for aged people like the
younger people.
PsychoSentiWordNet provides good coverage as
it an extension over SentiWordNet 3.0
(Baccianella et. al., 2010). In this paper, we
propose an interactive gaming (Dr Sentiment)
technology to collect psycho-sentimental polarity
for lexicons.
In this section we have philosophically argued
about the necessity of developing
PsychoSentiWordNet. In the next section we will
describe about the technical proposed architecture
for building the lexical resource. Section 3 explains
about some exciting outcomes that support the
usefulness of the PsychoSentiWordNet. What we
believe is the developed PsychoSentiWordNet will
help automatic sentiment analysis research in many
aspect and other disciplines as well, described in
the section 4.The data structure and organization is
described in section 5 and finally the present paper
concluded with section 6.

2 Dr Sentiment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951238095238">
Dr Sentiment 1 is a template based interactive
online game, which collects player’s sentiment by
asking a set of simple template based questions and
finally reveals a player’s sentimental status. Dr
Sentiment fetches random words from
SentiWordNet synsets and asks every player to tell
about his/her sentiment polarity understanding
regarding the concept behind.
There are several motivations behind developing
an intuitive game to automatically collect human
psycho-sentimental orientation information.
In the history of Information Retrieval research
there is a milestone when ESP game2 (Ahn et al.,
2004) innovate the concept of a game to
automatically label images available in the World
Wide Web. It has been identified as the most
reliable strategy to automatically annotate the
online images. We are highly motivated by the
success of the Image Labeler game.
A number of research endeavors could be found
in literature for creation of Sentiment Lexicon in

several languages and domains. These techniques
can be broadly categorized in two genres, one
follows classical manual annotation (Andreevskaia
and Bergler, 2006);(Wiebe and Riloff, 2006);
(Mohammad et al., 2008) techniques and the others
proposed various automatic techniques (Tong,
2001). Both types of techniques have few
limitations. Manual annotation techniques are
undoubtedly trustable but it generally takes time.
Automatic techniques demands manual validations
and are dependent on the corpus availability in the
respective domain. Manual annotation technique
required a large number of annotators to balance
one’s sentimentality in order to reach agreement.
But human annotators are quite unavailable and
costly.
But sentiment is a property of human
intelligence and is not entirely based on the
features of a language. Thus people’s involvement
is required to capture the sentiment of the human
society. We have developed an online game to
attract internet population for the creation of
PsychoSentiWordNet automatically. Involvement
of Internet population is an effective approach as
the population is very high in number and ever
growing (approx. 360,985,492) 3 . Internet
population consists of people with various
languages, cultures, age etc and thus not biased
towards any domain, language or particular
society. The Sign Up form of the “Dr Sentiment”
game asks the player to provide personal
information such as Sex, Age, City, Country,
Language and Profession.
The lexicons tagged by this system are credible
as it is tagged by human beings. In either way it is
not like a static sentiment lexicon set as it is
updated regularly. Almost 100 players per day are
currently playing it throughout the world in
different languages.
The game has four types of question templates.
For further detailed description the question
templates are named as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. To
make the gaming interface more interesting images
has been added with the help of Google image
search API 4 and to avoid biasness we have
randomized among the first ten images retrieved
by Google. Snapshots of different screens from the
game are presented in Figure 1.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936">
There are four types of questions: Q1, Q2, Q3 and
Q4. Dr Sentiment asks 30 questions to each
player.There are predefined distributions of each
question type as 11 for Q1, 11 for Q2, 4 for Q3 and
4 for Q4. There is no thumb rule behind the
cardinals rather they are arbitrarily chosen and
randomly changed for experimentation. The
questions are randomly asked to keep the game
more interesting.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996423">
2.2 Q1
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990325">
An English word from the English SentiWordNet
synset is randomly chosen. The Google image
search API is fired with the word as a query. An
image along with the word itself is shown in the
Q1 page of the game.
Players press the different emoticons (Fig 2) to
express their sentimentality. The interface keeps
log records of each interaction.

This question type is specially designed for relative
scoring technique. For example: good and better
both are positive but we need to know which one is
more positive than other. Table 1 shows how in
SentiWordNet relative scoring has been made.
With the present gaming technology relative
polarity scoring has been assigned to each n-n
word pair combination.
Now about the technical solution how we did it.
Randomly n (presently 2-4) words have been
chosen from the source SentiWordNet synsets
along with their images as retrieved by Google
API. Each player is then asked to select one of
them that he/she likes most. The relative score is
calculated and stored in the corresponding log log
table.

There are three types of Comments, Comment type

2.9 Dr Sentiment’s Prescription
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999649">
The final prescription depends on various factors
such as total number of positive, negative or
neutral comments and the total time taken by any
player. The final prescription also depends on the
range of the values of accumulating all the above
factors.
This is only the appealing factor to a player. The
provoking message for players is Dr Sentiment can
reveal their sentimental status: whether they are
extreme negative or positive or very much neutral
or diplomatic etc. A word previously tagged by a
player is avoided by the tracking system for the
next time playing as our intension is to tag more
and more words involving Internet population. We
observe that the strategy helps to keep the game
interesting as a large number of players return to
play the game after this strategy was implemented.
We are not demanding that the revealed status of
a player by Dr Sentiment is exact or ideal. It is
only to make fun but the outcomes of the game

The word “blue” get tagged by different players
around the world. But surprisingly it has been
tagged as positive from one part of the world and
negative from another part of the world. The
graphical illustration in Figure 3 explains the
situation. The observation is that most of the
negative tags are coming from the middle-east and
especially from the Islamic countries. We found a
line in Wiki5 (see in Religion Section) that may
give a good explanation: “Blue in Islam: In verse
20:102 of the Qur’an, the word cjj� zurq (plural of
azraq &apos;blue&apos;) is used metaphorically for evil doers
whose eyes are glazed with fear”. But other
explanations may be there for this. This is an

Deciding about the data structure of this kind of

used to keep user’s clicking log and their personal

As one of the research motivations was to
generate up-to-date prior polarity scores thus we
decided to generate web service API by that people
could access latest prior polarity scores. We do
believe this method will over perform than a static

In the present paper the development of the

the best of our knowledge this is the first endeavor
where sentiment meets psychology.

What previous studies proposed is to attach prior polarity to each sentiment lexicon level. Prior polarity is an approximation value based on corpus heuristics based statistics and not exact. The probabilistic fixed point prior polarity scores do not solve the problem completely rather it shoves the problem into next level, called contextual polarity classification. The hypothesis we started with is that the summation of all the regulating aspects of sentiment orientation is human psychology and thus it is called multi-faceted problem (Liu, 2010). More precisely what we meant by human psychology is the all known and unknown aspects, directly or indirectly govern the sentiment orientation knowledge of us. The regulating aspects wrapped in the present PsychoSentiWordNet are Gender, Age, City, Country, Language and Profession. The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension over the existing SentiWordNet to hold the possible psychological ingredients, governs the sentiment understandability of us. The PsychoSentiWordNet holds variable prior polarity scores, could be fetched depending upon those psychological regulating aspects. An example may ill</context>

We are highly motivated by the success of the Image Labeler game. A number of research endeavors could be found in literature for creation of Sentiment Lexicon in 1 http://www.amitavadas.com/Sentiment%20Game/ 2 http://www.espgame.org/ several languages and domains. These techniques can be broadly categorized in two genres, one follows classical manual annotation (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006);(Wiebe and Riloff, 2006); (Mohammad et al., 2008) techniques and the others proposed various automatic techniques (Tong, 2001). Both types of techniques have few limitations. Manual annotation techniques are undoubtedly trustable but it generally takes time. Automatic techniques demands manual validations and are dependent on the corpus availability in the respective domain. Manual annotation technique required a large number of annotators to balance one’s sentimentality in order to reach agreement. But human annotators are quite unavailable and costly. But sentiment is a property of human intelligence and is not entirely based on the features of a language. Thus people’s involvement is required to capture the sentim</context>
